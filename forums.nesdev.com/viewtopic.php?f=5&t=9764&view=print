You'll also find people referring to them as formal parameters and actual parameters, or in some cases formal arguments and actual arguments.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I used the terms &quot;argument&quot; and &quot;parameter&quot; interchangeably when it comes to discussing most programming language (two main ones being C and perl).  I tend to use the term &quot;argument(s)&quot; or &quot;function declaration argument(s)&quot; when referring to function definitions, and &quot;calling argument(s)&quot; when talking about arguments passed to a function when that function is used.  When it comes to <tt style="margin-left: 2px; margin-right: 2px; padding:3px; background-color: #3355aa; color: white;">argv[]</tt> I just call it &quot;argv&quot; or &quot;command-line arguments&quot;.<br /><br />The way I solve any ambiguity is to simply explain what it is I'm referring to; providing proper context goes a long way, especially if there's a (ethnic/racial/cultural) language barrier involved.<br /><br />Anyone splitting hairs over such semantics, to the point of it become a conversation topic/debate/argument needs to get some medication for whatever brain damage it is they have.  Yep, I really do feel that way about it.<br /><br />But likewise, if you're listening to someone explain something and you're not sure which of the above they're talking about&#058; <strong>ask them</strong>.  This has the additional benefit of showing the speaker that you're paying attention *and* that you want them to explain what they're doing; like I pointed out in another thread recently, if the programmer doesn't actually understand the code it is they're writing, then what the fuck good is it?<br /><br />I've begun to see a common trend in the past 6-7 years in mainly younger programmers who like to try and flex their proverbial balls in the above manner.  No Dwedit I'm not saying you're one -- I'm talking about folks who absolutely insist on calling things X and Y and Z and any other terminology; <strong>even if they understand based on context what it is you're saying</strong> you're still told &quot;stop calling them that, they're X/Y/Z&quot; (probably a form of Asperger's syndrome).  I tend to see this in Ruby and Python jackasses the most, followed equally by CS graduates who sound like they jacked off to a textbook for the past 4 years.<br /><br />I can relate it to perl asshats who get bent when you refer to an &quot;array&quot; as a &quot;list&quot; (<a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6023821/perl-array-vs-list" class="postlink">yes there is a difference</a> -- the latter is just a term to define &quot;a reference to an array&quot; -- but it doesn't fucking matter if the person you're speaking to/with has provided context).<br /><br />I want to pound these people into the pavement.  Repeatedly.

I tend to see this in Ruby and Python jackasses the most</div><br />Sometimes I've found myself doing this on Slashdot, especially when it comes to a few of <a href="https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/words-to-avoid.html#Consume" class="postlink">Richard Stallman's &quot;words to avoid&quot;</a>. But I won't reply to a post just to correct someone's language; I make sure to always have a topical reply as well. This way, the correction is perceived as necessary for avoiding <a href="http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?LaynesLaw" class="postlink">definition clash</a>. For example, someone might post that restrictions on what the owner of a piece of computing hardware may do with it are a good thing, that there's a good reason for a hard distinction between &quot;content consumption devices&quot; and &quot;content creation devices&quot;. So I'll start with the correction as a throwaway gag: &quot;Saying 'consumption' makes me think of tuberculosis. Now I'll assume that by 'consumption' you meant viewing works created by others. In that case:&quot; And then I reply to the post with some variation of <a href="http://tech.slashdot.org/comments.pl?sid=3411357&amp;cid=42707093" class="postlink">my upward mobility spiel</a>.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">I can relate it to perl asshats who get bent when you refer to an &quot;array&quot; as a &quot;list&quot; (<a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6023821/perl-array-vs-list" class="postlink">yes there is a difference</a> -- the latter is just a term to define &quot;a reference to an array&quot; -- but it doesn't fucking matter if the person you're speaking to/with has provided context).</div><br />In Python, the dynamic array type is called <tt style="margin-left: 2px; margin-right: 2px; padding:3px; background-color: #3355aa; color: white;">list</tt>. In Java, the dynamic array type is called <tt style="margin-left: 2px; margin-right: 2px; padding:3px; background-color: #3355aa; color: white;">java.util.ArrayList</tt>, splitting the difference. And my own dynamic array container that I wrote in C, based roughly on the interface of java.util.ArrayList, is called <tt style="margin-left: 2px; margin-right: 2px; padding:3px; background-color: #3355aa; color: white;">GapList</tt> because it leaves a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gap_buffer" class="postlink">gap in the buffer</a> that allows fast repeated insertions clustered around one area. This behavior is good for text editors. (PM me if you want to see the code.) But perhaps the confusion between an &quot;array&quot; and a &quot;list&quot; comes from a difference between the reference semantics of Perl and those of Python and Java.
