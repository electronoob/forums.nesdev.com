Having to converting binaries to text just seemed.. dumb.<br /><br />One thing I like about cc65 is that it's still being maintained by the developer (who seems to actually care about it, even), there's an mail list, and it's just got more features than I'll probably ever get around to using.<br /><br />WLA-DX is another popular one, looks cool.  It supports various processors though, and some of the conventions for using 6502 in it looks annoyingly awkward to me (and are kinda non-standard).<br /><br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"><br /><div class="quotetitle">Memblers wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">Very cool to hit F9 in ConTEXT, wait for the LED to turn green, reset my NES, and have my program running just like that.<br /></div><br /><br />this is exactly what i'd like to be doing, as well as stepping through game via the hardware.  i'm hoping copyNES allows me to do this sufficiently.  programming in emulators is ok, but i like to be interacting with the hardware directly.<br /></div><br /><br />Yeah, it's pretty nifty to be able to step through code with CopyNES.

Holds waveforms in RAM (so they can be modified by the NES and/or PIC), takes frequency and volume settings from the NES and outputs the samples to the NES with an IRQ so the NES can play it through it's DAC ($4011 register).  It does this for 4 channels, and sounds very nice.<br /><br />PIC can be set to do some automatic CHR bankswitching.  Counts scanlines, NES CPU cycles, has it's own 10Mhz timer, and can generate IRQs to the NES.  It's an 18F PIC too (18F4525, to be exact), so it has an 8x8 multiplier in hardware so some fast math stuff should be possible.<br /><br />It'll do pretty much anything you want it too, heheh, and it has a parallel port that sits on the NES CPU's data bus (with some limited addressing capability - enough to be useful), so it communicates fairly well with the NES, too.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"><br />i've seen several builds of FCE ULTRA, some with debugging tools and extensions to what was originally built.  do you find these tools useful?  does nintendulator provide any advantages over FCE ULTRA?<br /></div><br />Personally, I found the debugger in the standard version of FCEU to be more useful than the one in the FCEUXD version.<br /><br />Nintendulator is highly accurate, and also has some unique features in the debugger, like being able to see the current scanline, CPU cycle, and PPU status (hblank, vblank).  Very handy stuff when writing tricky timed code.<br /><br />FCEU isn't too accurate, really, but it's still the emu I use the most.  It'll run any working code just fine, and some non-working code sometimes.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=10">Memblers</a> — Thu Jan 04, 2007 10:57 am</p><hr />

I've actually been considering working towards an FDS-based development environment now that I've got FDSLoadr working. I'd have to get a Famicom keyboard and an actual Famicom rather than my current Famiclone (since the keyboard plugs into the expansion port,) but it'd be rather nice to have a full development environment running on actual hardware.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=1013">commodorejohn</a> — Wed Jan 03, 2007 2:38 pm</p><hr />

Apart from the usual stuff (assemblers and emulators) mentioned above, there are also the level map editors and other game-specific stuff.<br /><br />It's good that you have some programming experience to build tools to help you on those areas, as each game is a different project and there can't be a "generic level editor" that can be used for all projects.<br /><br />It is possible to use the NES as the platform for your tools (if you feel comfortable with the 6502 more than anything else) to a certain point. I think Celius has made a tile editor and a level editor that run on the NES itself, and any data to be saved is sent to SRAM, which, in emulators, is conveniently saved to a separate file.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=95">tokumaru</a> — Wed Jan 03, 2007 9:49 am</p><hr />

I use ConTEXT (freeware programmers text editor), quite a step up from using edit.com in a DOS window, heheh.<br /><br />I use cc65 (CA65 and LD65) for assembling, and I rather like it.  Lots of features, I've played with it's C compiler a bit too and that actually works (just don't use the NES library, it's totally broken on the hardware but does work in FCEU).<br /><br />I use Tile Molester for editing and importing tile graphics.  For editing single nametables, I still often use NSA (running in DOSBox.. heheh) out of habit, but 8name by tepples is very usable too.<br /><br />For testing my stuff I use an EPROM emulator (a really old 8kB through 512kB one, TurboROM by Parallax).  Set me back a couple hundred bucks (plus a little bit more to build a 32-pin DIP adapter cable), but I was desperate and I acquired that long before buying an EPROM programmer.  Definitely was worth it, but software emulators like Nintendulator are about good enough to where testing there is fairly safe.<br /><br />Very cool to hit F9 in ConTEXT, wait for the LED to turn green, reset my NES, and have my program running just like that.<br /><br />I've also made a devkit called Squeedo.

I use a 200mhz dev pc for most things, small form factor with parallel and serial ports moved to the front for ease of access. A copynes works great for things, although I still need to build a devcart for it. I may just get bunnyboy's cart when it becomes available.<br />As for the programming itself, I just use a text-editor. Haven't done too much NES programming due to a lack of free time though.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=245">gannon</a> — Tue Jan 02, 2007 3:48 pm</p><hr />
