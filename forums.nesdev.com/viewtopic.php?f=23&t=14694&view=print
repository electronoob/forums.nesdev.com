		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />That's surprising to me too. I mean, it's pretty crazy for the PCM/FM setup, but not enough for just streaming sound tracks. The only thing I can think of is for doing the former, but with dialogue, (beyond &quot;oomph&quot;) but how often is that used in an arcade game? Even voice samples in a fighting game aren't long enough to use that much data. At least I know why &quot;GIGA POWER&quot; games came into existence though, because had you been able to use those &quot;330 megabits&quot; of data however you wanted to, Metal Slug 3 would not need bank switching. (I guarantee it's that not all the tile data fit into a regular cartridge)

Really, the Neo Geo doesn't have seemed to be any more powerful than the other arcade boards of the era. Well, I actually don't know, because although the number of pixels it can display horizontally including overdraw is most likely lower than its closest (as in year made) competitor I can think of, the Irem M92, (unless Mame's Irem M92 driver accuracy is the problem, somehow Gunforce II never experiences sprite pixels per scan line problems) (CPS1 was made significantly earlier, and the CPS2 was made significantly later. Konami makes a new system for every game, and Sega had a million different arcade boards, with the ones being put into production at that time probably costing as much as an amusement park ride) it's also more than likely streaming more data required to get all that stuff to display in the first place considering you're dealing with only sprites that have more data than a simple background tile. If this sets it over the M92's bandwidth is a mystery to me though. I still think the fix layer is a waste of perfectly good bandwidth. You could have used it towards sprites, which it then wouldn't have enough bandwith to cover the width of the screen like the fix layer, but I mean, come on. Actually, even in later games, the lack of &quot;BG layers&quot; is odd. Aside for some freak situations, I can't even think of a time any game routinely pushes the bandwidth to even 3/4s.

Adapting to a more detailed art style is a matter not only of hardware but also of artist labor, and that might explain progression in parallel until the Super Famicom's ceiling was hit. The Neo Geo had a bit more headroom for games that played to its strengths. In 1995, investment in graphical complexity on the Super NES started to tail off as 2D developers shifted to the Saturn and whatever PlayStation games Sony didn't block under its deprecation of 2D.

The specs of the Neo Geo seem a lot more &quot;static&quot; than the SNES's in that there are no BG modes, transparency, or vram, but the fact that you can essentially split the balance between background layers and sprites any way you want definitely combats that. Does the Neo Geo have any raster effects, because I imagine that would help too. I'm only asking because I haven't seen any. I'd say I think the other problem in the Neo Geo not looking as good as the hardware would suggest compared to the SNES is that some of the limits of the Neo Geo are so high that they never even come close to being hit. Although the Neo Geo has 16x the number of palettes as the SNES, most games I've seen don't look like they ever go over 2x the amount because why would you need to really. You're sure as hell not needing to do any of this: <!-- l --><a class="postlink-local" href="http://forums.nesdev.com/viewtopic.php?f=12&amp;t=14662">viewtopic.php?f=12&amp;t=14662</a><!-- l --> Of course, I'm a big SNES fanboy, so don't take all of what I said earlier to seriously. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_lol.gif" alt=":lol:" title="Laughing" /> One thing that I probably disagree with a lot of people is that I think the SNES's color count is kind of lame. I mean, if you take any popular arcade machine from the day and compare its bandwidth to the SNES's, it's just like 2-4 times as high. However, you compare the number of palettes, and it's like 8-16 times as high. The thing is that the number of palettes is too low to give every object their own palette, but kind of too high to go the NES and Genesis approach of just having all the palettes sit there. Donkey Kong country can pull it off in that there aren't many different types of objects onscreen at a time, or even that many objects onscreen in general, but for something like a run and gun with a bunch of random stuff, this kind of falls apart. I'm sure most people would say the DKC games are just as colorful as the Metal Slug ones, but it only looks like it because every object has their own unique palette, but there are just more objects in a Metal Slug game.

Even some 1990/1991 games on the Neo had great graphics, basically far more varied graphical tiles compared to the SFC, thanks to gluttonous ROM space on Neo carts; as well as far more sprites (well, the Neo is essentially all sprites) for incidental effects.  Anyway, in my post, I criticized only SNK-developed titles, because games from Alpha Denshi, Pallas, Sammy, etc. had some great graphical design and colour use.<br /><br />By the way, the Neo-Geo hardware was originally designed by Alpha Denshi (check Wikipedia for info), and SNK did the manufacturing and marketing.  (Thus, I doubt if Psycho Soldier was on their minds...)

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" /><em>Mi </em>and <em>Ki </em>notation? Has it really come down to needing to use these terms when referring ram/rom/memory? I mean, it might be a bit more accurate than Mbit/Mbyte or whatever, but it was always understood at what was being stated (binary based system). Just wanted to make an observation that its popularity has been on the rise in the past few years (from what I've seen on forums). Makes me chuckle when people spell out <em>mebibyte</em> or <em>kibibit</em>; like a kindergartener mispronouncing a word.
