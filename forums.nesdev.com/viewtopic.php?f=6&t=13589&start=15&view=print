Others are ignored. </li><li>Portamento to target pitch is reinterpreted as legato when nonzero (<tt style="margin-left: 2px; margin-right: 2px; padding:3px; background-color: #3355aa; color: white;">301</tt> through <tt style="margin-left: 2px; margin-right: 2px; padding:3px; background-color: #3355aa; color: white;">3FF</tt>) and not-legato when zero (<tt style="margin-left: 2px; margin-right: 2px; padding:3px; background-color: #3355aa; color: white;">300</tt>). </li><li>Note slide (Qxy or Rxy) is treated as a slide to a legato note <em>y</em> semitones up or down one row later. </li><li>Pattern break (<tt style="margin-left: 2px; margin-right: 2px; padding:3px; background-color: #3355aa; color: white;">Dxx</tt>) is always assumed to jump to row 00. </li><li>It is not recommended to include a lot of tempo/speed changes in a single pattern, as each will expand to a <tt style="margin-left: 2px; margin-right: 2px; padding:3px; background-color: #3355aa; color: white;">setTempo</tt> in the conductor track. </li></ul><br />I'm not sure how to handle the noise channel, as FamiTracker allows playing a noise instrument at any pitch, while Pently assumes that all drum instruments use what FT calls &quot;fixed&quot; envelopes. In addition, all drums in Pently have finite length, while FT allows volume envelopes that end on a volume other than 0 (constant sustain). Should I treat each pitch at which a drum instrument is played as a separate drum?<br /><br />And how would I go about figuring out the time signature in order to set the scale (whether a row means an eighth, sixteenth, or thirty-second note) and calculate measure numbers for <tt style="margin-left: 2px; margin-right: 2px; padding:3px; background-color: #3355aa; color: white;">at</tt> commands?<br /><br />And is there demand for a way to assemble an NSF or NES program without having to have <tt style="margin-left: 2px; margin-right: 2px; padding:3px; background-color: #3355aa; color: white;">ca65</tt> and <tt style="margin-left: 2px; margin-right: 2px; padding:3px; background-color: #3355aa; color: white;">ld65</tt> installed?

Witch would be better to require? A 5 byte variable import or externally reserving specifically zero page 0 through 4?<br /><br />pently_resume_music and pently_stop_music were not found with the linker.<br /><br />I know this is not the case with every music engine (except maybe nerdtracker2), but i wonder if it's even possible to design the music data to be relocate without having to recompile the network of address pointers. I also wonder if it's easy to construct and play a pattern from RAM, so that there could be an option for the user to create and save some of her own music.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Is it possible to create a comprehensive guide that tells what can and cannot be when someone is composing music for Pently in Famitracker? (Also, I assume this is based on the current official stable build, though the 0CC fork has effects that equate Pently effects a lot better, like grace notes with Txy which is a delayed &quot;note transposition&quot;)<br />I might be composing a soundtrack for a game using Pently, and as a someone who's been a Famitracker user for 6 years, a plethora of different questions pop up even when trying to come up with ideas for music. Can I do X or Y, or Z? What is the Famitracker equivalent to drums in Pently? Even having read the manual and a number of different posts, it's still a bit of a mess in my head, and at this point it might be worth learning how to use the engine as intended with the text/MML-style sort of thing. From what I can tell it's not too much different from making music with an assembly source by using labels, constants and whatever, but even if I end up going that route I'd say it's worth making a guide for people who want to go strictly with Famitracker because if someone is hired to make music in Famitracker, they need to have the rules explained to them thoroughly.

I haven't had much of a chance to do so for two reasons: my recent illness and my having been hired to work on another NES game. Until then, please follow the guidelines described above at &quot;Here are the compromises that I had planned to make&quot; to see which envelopes and effects are most likely to end up ignored. Vibrato is ignored, and portamento-type effects become legato notes.<br /><br />I apologize for the inconvenience, but paid projects, housework, my finances, and personal physical fitness take precedence over free projects, and I have not yet been hired to work on Pently. I had planned to incorporate Pently into my previous paid project, but the boss instead ended up going with a different playback engine because the project's composer found the &quot;vibrato is ignored&quot; and &quot;portamento-type effects become legato notes&quot; limits unacceptable.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">What is the Famitracker equivalent to drums in Pently?</div><br />I plan to associate each combination of a noise pitch and noise instrument with a separate drum. If there are more than 25 such combinations, I plan to make conversion fail with an error message whose wording I have not yet made final.
