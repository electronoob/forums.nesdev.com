You can't just connect it based on the name, you have to connect based on the function.  I suggest connecting the 6162 pin3 to the SRAM CE pin.  That red wire CANNOT connect to both the '139 and 6162, you should ONLY let the '139 control that signal.<br /><br />What SRAM are you using?  It has two /CE and no CE?

Data sheet is here: <br /><br /><a href="http://www.buyicnow.com/files/datasheet/STATIC_RAM/343.pdf" class="postlink">http://www.buyicnow.com/files/datasheet/STATIC_RAM/343.pdf</a><br /><br />It shows its got a /CS1 (pin 20) and CS2 (pin 26). According to what i've found on a standard Hirom cart, is that pin 26 on the sram connected to MAD-1 pin 9, which goes to RESET. So i figured that would be connected to the RESET pin on the 6162...<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"> I suggest connecting the 6162 pin3 to the SRAM CE pin </div><br /><br />The reason I didnt do that, while connected to the '139, is that the saves would delete on almost every power down. When I moved the Sram CE to pin 5 it worked alot better.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">That red wire CANNOT connect to both the '139 and 6162, you should ONLY let the '139 control that signal</div><br /><br />So what you just said here kind of contradicts the previous quote... So you're saying that the /CE should be connected to the '139 and ONLY that? So connecting the 6162 pin 3 to /CE isnt what I want? That makes me a little confused...

That is why I suggested using the pin designed for the function you're trying to perform.

Ok, here is the new one:<br /><br />*old, removed*<br /><br />I have moved the line that was connected to the /RESET as you suggested to the 6162 pin 3, and so far it seems to be working. The '139 controls the SRAM /CE now, and the 6162 controls the CS2 (which im assuming would be the CE you mentioned). Does this look more accurate?

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Seems to be! I had a minor screw up in the schematic, because when I switched how the 6162 connected I forgot to tie in the /Reset pin to the cart connector. This was causing me not to be able to use the reset button on the console (push reset, game keeps playing with black screen). Now it seems to be working ok. I even went all psycho on it and pressed reset about a 100 times in a row, just to see what would happen. Saves were kept just fine! <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />I'm going to be keeping on eye on it for the next couple of days, just to verify that the saves are kept and that the battery isnt draining too quickly.<br /><br /><br /><strong>EDIT:</strong> NOPE! Just lost the first save file. damn...i thought it was fixed. It had seemed to work ok before I tied the 6162 pin 2 to cart /RST. Is there some other way I should be wiring that?

The two signals should have NOTHING to do with eachother they are BOTH output signals.  You're schematic should be good as is <img src="./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" />

So I'm not sure why you think/apparently need the 6162 to reset the SNES.  No other SNES carts have 6162's and they all reset just fine.  Original SNES carts merely connect the cart conn's reset pin to CS on the SRAM to prevent writing to SRAM during resets.<br /><br />Do original SNES carts reset just fine?

If the /RESET line is left unconnected from the cart connector (cart edge pin 26), the game does not reset at all. So if the RESET pin from the cart doesn't control the reset ability, what does? Can this be connected to the '139 in some way, like it is on pin 9 of the MAD-1?

You should be able to just leave it floating.<br /><br />With your multimeter reading 'DC volts' measuring across GND and cart edge /RESET, what does it read when the reset button is unpressed, and pressed while your cart is playing?<br /><br />I imagine it should read ~5v when not holding reset, and ~0v when holding reset.

I have cut the trace, and verified it to be working properly now, with the cart RESET line left floating as you suggested.<br /><br />Thanks for the help guys (especially you INL)!
