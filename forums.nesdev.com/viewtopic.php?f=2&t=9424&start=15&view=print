I've never seen a monochrome RS170 set with a CRT bigger than 12&quot;, and all of the larger ones were real monitors that used the higher bandwidth available (so wouldn't have a chroma killer). All of the rest I've seen were small portable ones, and once they excluded color display for cost or weight, and lacked RCA input, and the screen was so tiny (3-6&quot;) that 1- the electron beam size was comparable to the chroma dot size, so dot crawl wasn't terribly visible, 2- in case of cost savings, the only cheap chroma killer would be rather blurry and 3- NTSC OTA demodulation already is noisy and bandlimited enough that most chroma dots are drowned out.

Try asking wikipedia about any of the following: Chebychev, Butterworth, Elliptical, Constant k. Although wikipedia's description of the first 3 are all discrete-time variants, they all exist for both discrete and continuous time.

The color burst shows itself in the form of vertical lines, not a hatch pattern as a Famicom might, as the MD does not vary the color burst over time. This preserves vertical lines better, but results in a more predictable field of artifacts. <br /><br /><img src="http://mikejmoffitt.com/img/zenith_color.JPG" alt="Image" />

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Sega VDPs aren't the only TMS9918-family VDPs that have this problem. Because the scanline is 342 pixels long, an even multiple of the color subcarrier, vertical lines at a given position will hit the same phase every time. NES and Super NES have a similar problem: check out the diagonal stripes in the checkerboard dithering on the title screen of Dr. Mario for NES.<br /><br />There is in fact a way to correct this. It involves making the scanline 341.25 dots long (exactly the same as the NTSC standard), and then making the post-render line 342 dots long instead of 341.25 to correct the phase for the next frame. But like the Johnson counter that divides by 16 instead of the expected 15 in the PAL NES CPU, it was Nintendo being stingy with the die size.
