Tribute games that use all original programming and assets are not hacks: They are works of art and love.    Not informing ourselves is in some ways worse than the companies who directly kill our freedom of expression.

A company will care about similarities and likenesses once somebody looks at a game and thinks, &quot;Oh, it's Mario!&quot;. This homebrew soft is a great piece of work and I'm glad it was made, but something that is so obviously a mario <s>clone</s> homage shouldn't have been sold on cartridges. Had this not been so [obviously] sold, and instead was offered as a free homebrew ROM download, Nintendo would have likely been a lot less concerned. <br /><br />While this game's sprites are not identical to any sprites featured in the original NES games, they are obviously modified (mostly scaled down and color-reduced) or were drawn while the artist was looking at the original. I am in particular referring to the Mario sprites' facial features. The look just screams &quot;Super Mario Brothers 3&quot;, even more so for the small Mario sprite. <br /><br />Pointing out, &quot;These aren't directly ripped sprites! The music was re-created! He never used the word Mario!&quot; is a pretty snarky defense that seems to be founded in small technicalities... <br /><br /><span style="font-size: 50%; line-height: normal">Sorry if that comes off as overly angry or harsh, it's just an argument I see frequently comes up and the &quot;similar-but-not-the-same&quot; defense has been irksome to me for a while.</span>

I really fail to see the programmer or AtariAge as victims in this case. If someone wants to clone Mario on the 2600 as a homage or an experiment, that's fine, it's just fanwork. But once you try to sell that, you're just asking for trouble.

I don't know if the ROM itself was available as a free download.<br /><br />The game and cartridge are no longer available for purchase, and no explanation has been given.<br /><br /><strong>Everything else, including talk of a C&amp;D, is <em>speculation</em> because the parties involved are not giving any information.</strong><br /><br />---------- SPECULATION BELOW ----------<br />If it were indeed a C&amp;D, I believe it would've been because the game was available for sale (for between $20-$50 each, if the prices of the other games are of any indication), which means the producer was <strong>making money off of</strong> characters being used without permission. Recouping for lost sales <em>is</em> a legitimate reason to threaten legal action, regardless of how ridiculous the situation may be. If it were just a free download instead of a purchased good, everything would've been fine, because Nintendo isn't losing money to a game that used its indica without permission.<br /><br />They still may not like that one of their assets is being used without permission (potentially doing something or being portrayed in a way they don't like), but it would hurt them more than it would help them to say &quot;no fan games / fan art / fan anything&quot;, so they likely would take no action. Hence why various Mario flash games and centralized SMW romhack sites still exist, but the minute any of those products go on sale, it's fair game.<br />---------- END OF SPECULATION ----------<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">tokumaru wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">The only problem here is that this doesn't solve the problem for people who like to buy actual carts to collect.</div><br />There's nothing stopping them from offering a &quot;cart kit&quot; of an empty cartridge shell, a PCB and components minus the ROM, some screws and a sticky label, and just letting you burn and build the cart yourself. That way, they're only making money off of selling parts for a cartridge, without actually selling the game.

Everyone can get a cart shell and PCB from a cheap donor and print a high quality label in the nearest shop (BTW, selling a label with Mario on it would probably be a no-no too), but programming a ROM and soldering it is past the capabilities of most collectors (they often lack the skill and/or the tools).<br /><br />Note that I'm not saying I feel sorry for the collectors or anything like that, if they really want a cart and are not able to make one themselves they'll most likely pay the extra cash to have someone make it, I was just pointing out that providing a patch to turn the legal ROM into the questionable one doesn't solve the problem of not being able to sell a Mario homebrew.

I classify these kinds of games as tribute or homage.<br /><br />  Honestly I was fishing for what people consider appropriate to make a non infringing but clearly paying tribute to certain games.  How would one pay tribute to, say, Super Pitfall without fear of C&amp;D?<br /><br />Is it really just a matter of imitating the game engine and replacing character names, sprites and music to something different?  How different?  Where is the line?
