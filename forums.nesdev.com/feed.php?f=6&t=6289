I've listened to nsfs with headphones in many different players, as well as the NES directly through a mixer, and I've never really noticed it sounding bad. I mean I think I understand some of the complaints mentioned here (not bassy 'enough', etc), but perhaps I've just been used to the sound and it hasn't really bothered me.<br /><br />I do have a set of earbuds that it sounds really muffled through, but that's all music and not just NES music.

I guess lots of commercial Nintendo games were written with TV speakers in mind. I don't listen to much of that anymore because, yeah, it's ear-piercing.

I've never had a problem with NSFs through headphones.

i think the 2a03 is capable of good bass, especially from the Triangle waveform. though even with a straight Triangle wave on its own, there's still some odd high-frequency content in there somewhere that can really grate on your ears after a while. the other channels aren't any better in their regard to outputting high frequencies, and the DPCM channel can get pretty nasty due to sample aliasing. the problem is that there's no filtering capabilities in the 2a03, which always leaves the highs blasting. <br /><br />there's not much of any way around it on the hardware, but it can be fine-tuned to some degree using external EQ. as for headphones, (i'm not sure what you have now, but) you try another set with a flatter frequency response or even bass-enhancement.  <br /><br />the Game Boy is similar, sometimes it just starts to hurt your ears after a while.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=4315">jbuonacc</a> — Tue Apr 13, 2010 10:34 am</p><hr />
