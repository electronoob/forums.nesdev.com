Even though it's missing tons of stuff including latch data, sound registers, all information necessary to draw the previous frame, etc.  I think that more blocks is better, and state information should not be combined with large RAM blocks.  If anyone is worried about size, just gzip the thing or something.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I'm in agreement with regards to using plenty of separate blocks. Using gzip on the entire file (which is what I do in my emulator, for save states and movies) can be done transparently, and allows it to be optional. For one, all arrays should be in separate blocks (except maybe the 24 bytes of PPU palette RAM). But I don't understand the need for information necessary to draw the previous frame. Aren't the 20 or so bytes of PPU registers (not counting palette) sufficient for PPU state just after vblank begins?
<br />
<br />CPU: PC, S, P, A, X, Y (7 bytes)
<br />PPU: 2000, 2001, 2002, 2003, 2007, second write flag, VADDR, VTEMP, pixel x, palette (43 bytes)
<br />APU: 4000-4013, 4015, 4017, internal state (69 bytes)
<br />Joypad: joypad 1 shift register, joypad 2 shifter register, 4016 (9 bytes)
<br />Low RAM: 2048 bytes
<br />Sprite RAM: 256 bytes
<br />Nametable RAM: 2048 bytes
<br />CHR RAM: 8192 bytes
<br />High RAM: 8192 bytes
<br />
<br />This is roughly what I use, and haven't had problems with desync in movies. I also can't think of any reasonable emulator design that would make it hard to import and export in this format.

<br />All three of these are mapper dependent. DEROM has 4 KB of VRAM for nametables. CPROM has 16 KB of VRAM for patterns. Some MMC5 boards have more than 8 KB of bankswitched WRAM, and the FDS has 32 KB.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Interesting; I guess for those screen-watching games you'd need to store a pixel map of the current CRT state, perhaps just in grayscale. And yes, the RAM blocks would be larger for some mappers; I was giving a general idea and trying not to bog it down with details like this. Each of the above would be in its own block so making it larger would just mean writing more data. i.e. 8K of CHR RAM might be in a block that's stored as (including header):
<br />
<br />52 52 48 43 00 20 00 00 &lt;8KB of data&gt;

<br />I'm not sure about this, I haven't yet emulated the zapper... or savestates... and as for the poor little ROB fellow, I don't know anything about its inner workings :p
<br />
<br />A pixel map would be nice to have (screenshots with states), but should not be mandatory.
<br />
<br />
<br />How about using an existing savestate format as a base ? Like Quietust's, who hasn't documented his savestate format for no reason <img src="./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" />

<br />i've still got a cough i'm getting over and i'm going to cough in your general direction.
<br />
<br />Edit: (extended message)
<br />I didn't consider the topic dead just at a disagreement.  Emu authors and coders I would like to hear what you have to say on the matter of the format of the data.

This is easy to write and read without any extra state information. Any additional complexity in reading and writing has to give some useful benefit.</div>
<br />Hi! This is very similar to the SNES9x savestate format, which is very nice to work with. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=":wink:" title="Wink" /> 
<br />
<br />It has a file header, consisting of: signature (8 chars) + colon + version (4 chars, readable text) + ASCII char #10.
<br />The blocks also have a header: name (3 chars, readable text) + colon + block size (6 chars, readable text) + colon. Some blocks are not mandatory.
<br />The smaller variables are affected by endianness, the big arrays are not.
<br />The files are accessed via GZIP, which handles compression and can read uncompressed files too.
<br />
<br />I'd suggest using a format similar to this, but using the colons (or other separators) to allow for variable-length strings. The endian-format could be stored in the file header.
