		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Just wondering if this is the generally accepted approach to detecting if you are in a PAL or an NTSC system.
<br />
<br />- In the NMI handler clear a counter and set a flag variable and RTI
<br />- In the reset handler infinite loop, if the flag is set increment a counter over and over (probably needs to be 16 bit)
<br />- When the next NMI handler fires, un-set the flag (or change states in the state machine), and determine what mode we are in based on that counter.     I can look at the values in a debugger and so I can see which value I get on PAL and which on NTSC, and base my mode on those values.
<br />
<br />Is this how you guys do it?  I want to make sure I approach this correctly.
<br />
<br />Thanks,
<br />Al

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />A simpler way would be to start a two notes on the APU with lengths 1 and 2, poll $4015 until the first one stops, then poll $4015 until the second one stops and count the number of iterations. The count will tell whether it's NTSC or PAL. When I get a spare moment I'll try implementing this and testing it on both types of NES.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />If you write to $4017 to reset the frame sequencer immediately before running the test, then you'll only need one note (of length 1) to determine the timing.  This method is probably the simplest since it does not depend on interrupt code timing (which can vary as you extend the capabilities of your NMI handler).  However, it might not work well in emulators that don't properly implement APU timing (especially for PAL).  Using NMI timing is likely to be more emulation-safe.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Hey, I'm getting a bit outtopic, but I also trough of this method once, when brainstorming about how a MMC5 cart could detect if it has it's sound hardware implemented or not. Just start a note with a run time-lenght, and poll $5015 for a while. If it's set forever (or clear forever), then the MMC5 doesn't have sound. Unfortunately, carts without sound still have it implemented. This could still detect bad emulators or simplified MMC5s faked by other circuits.

<br />
<br />I have a question about how you test though.   Are you able to run a PAL NES (with a proper power converter) on an NTSC TV.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Now that I look at Years Behind, it seems I actually used the buggy polling of $2002 to wait for the next frame when doing the PAL/NTSC detection. This should mean that with enough resets, you could in theory get the cart to run on NTSC with a lucky shot. The demo would crash later on though. 
<br />
<br />Gotta try this sometime. :)

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I got it working.  I reset the frame counter, emit a sound, and poll 4015 until the sounds completes.  However I dont really know why the sound that I chose works.  As far as I can tell, its a zero length sound.  Is the reason it worked because I disabled the length counter, or because a sound cannot have a length of zero.
<br />
<br />Anyways here's the code.   
<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">; Reset the audio frame counter<br />&nbsp; LDA #$40&nbsp; &nbsp;; same as #%01000000<br />&nbsp; STA $4017&nbsp; <br /><br />; Make a sound on rect1<br />&nbsp; LDA #$00 <br />&nbsp; STA $4000<br />&nbsp; STA $4001<br />&nbsp; STA $4002 <br />&nbsp; STA $4003 <br /><br />; Poll 4015 &#40;lowest bit is rect1&#41; until the sound goes away<br />TEST_REGION:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; INC REGION_CHECK_LOW<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; BNE :+<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; INC REGION_CHECK_HIGH<br />:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; LDA $4015<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; AND #$01<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; BNE TEST_REGION<br /></div>
<br />
<br />Even though it works, am I actually doing this right? 
<br />(edit- make the code readable)
<br />
<br />BTW:  REGION_CHECK_LOW and REGION_CHECK_HIGH are variables on zero page.
<br />I found that in FCEU the high gets a value of 0x22 on NTSC and 0x26 on PAL (so I just say its PAL if the value exceeds 0x24) Seems to work find in Nintendulator as well (although I'm having troubles viewing  the memory).  Real hardware (NTSC) is also fine.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />OK, you've persuaded me to write some code and run it on my NTSC and PAL NES motherboards. As for zero length, remember that the value you write to $4003 in the upper 5 bits is an index into the length <em>table</em>, not the length itself. As I remember, $00 gives a length of $0A. If you used <strong>$18</strong> (corrected), you'd get a length of $02, the shortest available. Same goes for writing zero to $4000; this doesn't give zero volume, but rather a quick envelope. The reason you get a silent square is because you used a period of 0 ($4002 and $4003).
<br />
<br /><strong>EDIT:</strong> made correction, should have been length index $18, not $08.

Runs fine in emulators I have checked, but they will likely do something different at reset.  According to microbug is_pal_nes_loop is never exited.  Using microbug shouldn't be a problem because it is waiting for the audio to not be playing?  Any ideas?

LJ65's init code just counts cycles between two NMIs.

<br />Famicom, NTSC NES, PAL/M NES, PlayChoice: 262*341/3 ~= 29780 c
<br />PAL NES: 312*341/3.2 ~= 33247 c

<br />Dendy is thought to use PAL scanline count but an NTSC compatible divider, which would give 312*341/3 ~= 35464 c. But does anyone on this board have access to a Dendy unit and a devcart to run tests?
