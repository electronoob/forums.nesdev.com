I suppose some people will prefer it that way.<br /><br />Long before there was an NTSC filter (like, around 2000 or so) I was fascinated by how images looked more detailed and colorful in video captures than in emulator shots. I would always apply random blurring and noise to my mock-ups (I didn't know how to code for the NES back then, and didn't even have an actual console, so I just spent a lot of my time drawing NES sprites and backgrounds) so that they'd look cooler. Years later I was obviously very pleased when blargg released his filters, because I would be able to see the games as they were supposed to be seen, including my own stuff.<br /><br />But I know that not everyone thinks like me, and I accept that. For me, tweaking the graphics to make them look cooler in NTSC is just one more step of the fun that is developing a game, but I guess that, for many people, what I consider to be extra detail and texture is just unwanted noise.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=95">tokumaru</a> — Sun Jan 09, 2011 6:56 pm</p><hr />

It's a valid process, even if you didn't directly have an editor on the famicom dev system itself.<br /><br /> <br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"><br />The benefit of using this trick is that you can practically fit 2 color scales in a single palette (a lot of games just use 1 gradient per palette), since black can shadow both colors and gray can highlight them. This increases the apparent amount of colors on screen, since there are more hues.<br /></div><br /><br /> You can see that usage of gray like that in Genesis games too. On PCE, there's a low precision RGB to YUV map built in the video out chip - the conversion is done on a digital level. This adds artifacts in the color rage, for all 512 colors (making it effectively different than the Genesis 9bit palette). The side effect is that there are some gray-ish greens and gray-ish purples that blend better than a straight RGB palette. And there are games on the PC-Engine that benefit directly from this. It would be safe to say they designed the colors for the graphics with this in mind. Similar to the famicom examples.<br /><br /> <br /> NES is definitely one system that I prefer the NTSC emulation artifact look. That WAS the NES look. Even if you get the colors right, a raw emulation shot just doesn't look right. Like tepples stated, the placement of the pixel to subcarrier line phase offset - really gives the NES a unique look (other than the SNES, I don't know of any other system that employs this three scanline phase shift cycle. PCE is only two scanline cycle at 180 degrees out).<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3645">tomaitheous</a> — Tue Jan 04, 2011 2:28 am</p><hr />

<div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"><br />True. I for example hate upscaling filters like HQ2X. I don't think you can invent details that weren't there in the first place and expect that to look good in every situation. I hate the wobbly edges and rounded corners that are generated as a result.<br /></div><br />They doesn't intent details, but like you said they made corners rounder, which often make things look better, but of course not always.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"><br />You don't think that colorful is good?<br /></div><br />Yes, but I meant the Genesis doesn't have much more colors than the NES.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"><br />I think it's a given that all these old game graphics were design with PAL or NTSC display in mind - not what unfiltered emulation shows.<br /></div><br />I completely disagree. How many tiles editors does allow to edit graphics with a NTSC or PAL filter in mind ??<br />For games released back then as computers were really not powerfull, they did most of their graphics on paper first which didn't have NTSC or PAL filtering. Chances are that they fixed a few things if it turned to look really wrong on their TV (most games are Japanese so most of them have been tested on NTSC first), but other than that they probably didn't "design" graphics with NTSC display in mind.<br /><br />For games/demoes released today, we use tile editors without NTSC filter, so our graphics aren't meant to be see "with NTSC filter". Even if we test it with Blarg's filter or on our screen, again we will only change something if it really looks wrong.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=38">Bregalad</a> — Sun Jan 02, 2011 10:43 am</p><hr />
