If you did it as an NSF instead of a VRC6 NES, you could just use NSF 4k bankswitching. You'd have less problems with fragmentation wasting space, too, and could probably get more to fit in a single file. The way I did for 2A03 puritans, you don't need to work with the Famitracker driver source or BIN export, you can just take the NSFs and patch a few bytes in it each to use an alternative bankswitching routine placed in RAM (or for the ones that don't bankswitch you don't need to patch that at all).<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=5165">rainwarrior</a> — Mon Jun 02, 2014 10:15 am</p><hr />

I updated my post so the patch actually works now.  I forgot to force the modules to play the first track.<br /><br />But I can't finish the job, because Famitracker won't create a .BIN file for songs that use bankswitching.  The code now, using NSF bankswitching unfortunately, according the comments is paging pattern data at $B000-$BFFF.  VRC6 pages $8000-$BFFF all together.  Of course it's always still doable, it just means more changes are needed.<br /><br />I could make one that plays all the non-bankswitched tracks, if that helps.  I would need to know what order to put them in, unless you're wanting to build from the source.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=10">Memblers</a> — Sun Jun 01, 2014 10:38 pm</p><hr />

No, 2A03 Puritans did not merge FTMs. It merges NSFs.<br /><br />I wouldn't recommend trying NSFImport to merge things. Your file size will bloat and you'll exceed your 256k limit very quickly.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=5165">rainwarrior</a> — Sun Jun 01, 2014 11:07 am</p><hr />

In the past I've modified Famitracker's replay code to play multiple modules instead of sub-songs.  It was for an older version (2.1), but probably works the same way.  I could take a few minutes to do the same with the newest version.<br /><br />OK, for whatever reason every NSF I build with v2.9 is silent (even before modifying it).  Maybe it's my ca65 version (v2.13.9), I don't know.  This is where a 5 minute project becomes a trip down the rabbit hole.  But totally untested, here's the patch:<br /><br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">in driver.s, before this line:<br />; End of variable space<br />put:<br />ft_music_addr:          .res 2<br /><br />in driver.s, after this part:<br />;ft_music_addr:<br />;   .word * + 2<br />;   .incbin &quot;music.bin&quot;         ; Music data<br /><br />comment it out, and put this:<br />ftsong0:  .incbin &quot;potential.bin&quot;<br />ftsong1:  ;<br />ftsong2:  ;<br />ftsong3:  ;<br />ftsong4:  ;<br />ftsong5:<br />ftsong6:<br />ftsong7:<br />ftsong8:<br /><br />ft_music_table:<br />        .word ftsong0<br />        .word ftsong1<br />        .word ftsong2<br />        .word ftsong3<br />        .word ftsong4<br />        .word ftsong5<br />        .word ftsong6<br />        .word ftsong7<br />        .word ftsong8<br /><br />in init.s, after this:<br />ft_load_song:<br />        pha<br /><br />put this:<br />        tay<br />        lda ft_music_table,y<br />        sta ft_music_addr<br />        lda ft_music_table+1,y<br />        sta ft_music_addr+1<br /><br /><br />- edit -<br /><br />in nsf_wrap.s, at the top, add this:<br />RELOCATE_MUSIC = 1<br /><br />in init.s, before this:<br />jsr ft_load_track<br /><br />put this:<br />ldy #0<br /><br /></div><br /><br />This is untested, it's a little cleaner than the mod I previously did to v2.1. (edit - tested now for v2.9, it works)<br /><br />As for song changing, in player.s you could put the code in the ft_cmd_halt: routine, to increment the song on the halt command.  Load the new number in A, be sure to set X to 0 or 1 (for NTSC/PAL), then JMP (not JSR) to the init routine.  A while back I did hack just like that with Nerdtracker2, for Chibi-Tech, who used more patterns than it supported.<br /><br />And obviously, you pretty quickly need bankswitching.  Just add another table and use it like ft_music_table.  I know this info isn't a lot of help to a non-programmer, but I'm kinda stuck since I can't test it.<br /><br />edit: Added a couple more changes so the patch works properly.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=10">Memblers</a> — Sat May 31, 2014 12:32 am</p><hr />

<div class="quotetitle">rainwarrior wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"><br />I presume learning to program, and also learning to program on the NES, are going to be the sticking points. You can do both of these things, but there is a large time commitment. Get started right now. If you get to work on it, and start asking specific questions, a lot of people here would be happy to answer and help you through.<br /></div><br /><br />While this is definitely my intention in the future, unfortunately right now I simply don't have the time to dedicate to it. Between a full time job, freelance work, and writing music, my time is pretty limited to dedicate to learning a new programming language. I'd be starting from square one and don't have the confidence that I could finish something like this before we leave for our tour next month.<br /><br />With my bands new album coming out at the beginning of next month, and a tour following shortly thereafter, my main concern is writing and perfecting our live show. This is where my request for help with the rom really stems from. <br /><br />Again, while I'm sure that saying &quot;im a musician first&quot; seems like a bit of a cop-out to some, please understand that its not meant as an blatant excuse or slight to those who do spend time doing this. I've been composing music for the NES using famitracker since early 2008, and in that time using separate .nsfs has sufficed for our live shows. However the first real need for a rom like the one im asking for has only come up recently as the songs I write have been getting lengthier and include interludes.  I've really only realized that it is possible to make a sort of &quot;gapless&quot; album ROM after seeing rainwarriors work with MOON8 and more recently with the 2a03Puritains cart. Seeing these in action have really made it clear that it can be done. <br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">rainwarrior wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"><br />Anyhow, posts that are essentially &quot;can somebody make something for me&quot; don't tend to get a lot of response here. If you want us to be excited about it, maybe you should try to give us a reason to be excited for it. What are you making? You haven't shared anything about it at all. Alternatively, if you are looking to hire someone, this isn't a good job posting board in general, but even so, you haven't made any offer in that respect. Do you expect there to be a bunch of pro NES developers here who will chase down every possible job lead? That's not really what this scene is made of. It's amateurs having fun trying things out in their free time. There are small handfull here that could do it, maybe, but you haven't put anything on the table.<br /></div><br /><br />I guess I might not have been as clear as i could have in my initial post. So ill try my best to elaborate on it more. But first maybe I'd do well to talk a little bit about why I need it.<br /><br />I'm in a band called <a href="https://www.facebook.com/pages/Noisewaves/102269456516354" class="postlink">Noisewaves</a>. We've been involved in the chipmusic scene since early 2008 and have been playing live at events like Magfest, Blipfest, 8static, and Rochester Chip Fest since early 2011.<br /><br />For the past three years I’ve been composing our newest album, which in my personal experience, has pushed the limits of what I’ve done so far with the NES musically and sonically. <br /><br />In a way, our newest album is similar to Pink Floyd’s “Dark Side of the Moon” in that it’s almost one continuous piece of music. Intended to be listened to sequentially. <br /><br />The reason for my request is that when we play live, we would like our set to be one continuous piece… e.g: no pauses in between songs. Just one long gapless set. However, the current (and only) way i know how to play my songs off an NES involve the use of separate .nsf files, which as you all know require loading and reloading, therefore causing pauses as well as an audible clicking. I would like to eliminate this entirely, and i know its possible after seeing rain warriors work.<br /><br />I’ve tried using various other techniques involving programs like Vegaplay, as well as trying to combine ftm files in famitracker..however no matter what i try, i have never achieved the outcome I truly wanted. <br /><br />I would also like to (once we have money) invest in releasing our album on actual NES carts as well.<br /><br />This rom would serve a dual purpose:<br /><br />It would allow me to construct various live set lists now and in the future<br />It would allow me to release this music on an actual cart<br /><br /><br />I hope that paints a better picture of what Im trying to do with this. <br /><br />I reached out to this community because I honestly felt that it was something I could find help with here.<br /><br />I’m not sure what else I can put on the table other than the fact that you would be helping a person who is passionate about how the NES can be used musically, achieve something that could change the way people look at chip music and variants.<br /><br />I definitely don’t expect this type of work to be taken lightly and that is why I offered compensation, not because its a means to end, but because I honestly would want to pay someone for their time and tutoring. You have knowledge and skills that I don’t, but we are both passionate about the NES and what its capable of, therefore i figured it might be something the community could help me with.<br /><br />That being said, i hope this clears things up. Please let me know if you can help, I would really appreciate it.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3970">elsh</a> — Fri May 30, 2014 4:30 pm</p><hr />

A Famitracker NSF has a memory location that can be tested for the C00 event. Unfortunately, it also clears $4015, which will lead to a pop between tracks, though there is likely a $4011 = 0 in the init code somewhere as well. Though, I suppose that wouldn't be the hard part. Probably harder getting back to the ROM BIOS and finding the next file.<br /><br />Using Famitracker's BIN export and rebuilding the player code from source is way easier, especially if you cut your tracks into segments that don't have to bankswitch.<br /><br />The VRC6 requirement means you have to deal with the VRC6 banking scheme, but that's not really that tough.<br /><br />I presume learning to program, and also learning to program on the NES, are going to be the sticking points. You can do both of these things, but there is a large time commitment. Get started right now. If you get to work on it, and start asking specific questions, a lot of people here would be happy to answer and help you through.<br /><br /><br />Anyhow, posts that are essentially &quot;can somebody make something for me&quot; don't tend to get a lot of response here. If you want us to be excited about it, maybe you should try to give us a reason to be excited for it. What are you making? You haven't shared anything about it at all. Alternatively, if you are looking to hire someone, this isn't a good job posting board in general, but even so, you haven't made any offer in that respect. Do you expect there to be a bunch of pro NES developers here who will chase down every possible job lead? That's not really what this scene is made of. It's amateurs having fun trying things out in their free time. There are small handfull here that could do it, maybe, but you haven't put anything on the table.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=5165">rainwarrior</a> — Fri May 30, 2014 4:53 am</p><hr />

What you're asking for is indeed fairly involved.<br /><br />Just throwing this out there: it might make more sense to modify the PowerPak software to play multiple NSF files in sequence. That said, this is not a trivial task, either (but not impossible).<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=80">thefox</a> — Fri May 30, 2014 3:59 am</p><hr />
