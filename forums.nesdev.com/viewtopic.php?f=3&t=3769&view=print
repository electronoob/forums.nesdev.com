		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I made a simple ROM that just displays a .nam file on screen. I tested it out on a few emulators, and it looked just like I wanted it to. However, I tested it out in NESticle just for kicks, and I noticed that the colors were horrible. I thought that when I display that image in a real game, I really don't want it to look like that. So I just need to make sure of something. Since Nintendulator is a really really accurate emulator, is it also accurate in terms of color? I don't have the proper things to test it on the real system. If it is, then I'm safe. If they look like NESticle's, then I'm screwed.

<br />
<br />I second dXtr's motion to try your screen mock-ups on an emulator that performs NTSC simulation, such as Nestopia. Also remember that pixels on an NES connected to a TV are not square; instead, NTSC NES images are stretched horizontally by a factor very close to 8/7, which Nintendulator did not emulate last time I checked.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Yeah, Nesticle's colors are not very good. The Color $11 appears too bright, and it just is too much of a step up from $01.
<br />
<br />I noticed that 2x2 metatiles are not square on a television. Nintendulator does not emulate this. That's just because the TV's pixel ratio is 3:4 when what's being displayed on screen is supposed to be 7:8(224:256), right?

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I wouldn't recommend using just a palette to see how it would look, since there are lots of color mixing effects you get with NTSC composite video, some making things look awful. Some emulator authors aren't interested in what happens to the pixels once they get converted into composite video, so you have to use a different emulator like Nestopia.

<br />No, the TV screen is 4:3, but the pixels on it depend on the system generating them. To summarize, an NTSC NES pixel is about 15% wider than it is tall, and a PAL NES pixel is about 39% wider than it is tall (<a href="http://nesdev.com/bbs/viewtopic.php?p=24815#24815" class="postlink">full details</a>).

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I had the ratios backwards, sorry. And even that isn't correct. Oh well.
<br />
<br />So let me ask this, even though it's slightly unrelated. It says that there are 282 pixels horizontally per scanline, 256 are on screen. Would that be the reason for no sprite wrap around?

<br />No. The way you described it a few messages ago for lack of vertical wrapping sounded spot-on, and would be the same reason for lack of horizontal wrapping I'd think.
