		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Tokumaru- It was <em>so</em> broken. It feels like someone had been given a week at most, with no or minimal testing, to scribble in a corner of the masks they were going to use. I think the bits within each byte are backwards, and the R/W logic decoding is definitely backwards. And in Quietust's sim I've never managed to frob nodes high or low to get it to actually count.<br /><br />The real question in my mind is, given the number of silicon revisions they went through, why didn't they fix it? I guess it's a much more incompatible change than just &quot;adding tonal noise mode&quot; or whatever other changes we know of.<br /><br />Myask- <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />Certainly $401C-$401E were the 24-bit counter (little-endian), and both readable and writable. But $401F is a full eight bits wide, not a counter, and I'm having/had the hardest time tracing anything down. (The only clear thing is that $401F &amp; $01 controls whether the IRQ flag can signal the CPU) There was also some funny behavior in $4016 and $4017 pertaining to it. There might have been an automatic reload value? I see two S-R latch structures in each bit.

I take it you never followed up on that?<br /><br />Hmm…24 bits is really long for a cycle counter. Almost ten seconds' worth on NTSC(~9.4), but if $4017 reads really reset it, then you'd have to not use 2p to get that.<br /><br />Colorblindness isn't helping any. You have a node for W401F?

(might just have integer multiples for seconds))<br />and have special reloads come from some period table like the APU does.<br />Was also considering having a &quot;freeze&quot; bit, since it'd be a little annoying to load a counter while it's running. Or a &quot;set reload to counter&quot;/&quot;set counter to reload&quot; pair of bits.
