		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Hi all! As I have mentioned a few times I am working on an MMC3 mapper implementation and a dev cart to go along with it. I am working with a local manufacturer that will do runs of 10 for me. I expect to have the prototype ready to go in Q4.
<br />
<br />Anyhow, I need to figure out what features would be desirable to the community and what price point we are looking at.
<br />
<br />Here are the features that I personally want:
<br />
<br />2MB PRG-ROM
<br />8KB CHR-RAM
<br />8KB PRG-RAM, battery-backed
<br />No provisions for CHR-ROM
<br />USB interface for reading and writing all memory spaces.
<br />
<br />I think I can do this for around $50 retail, all chips included with no soldering required.
<br />
<br />Another option would be to include 256KB of battery-backed CHR-RAM so the cart could support CHR-ROM based development. This might add $10 or more to the cost.
<br />
<br />Are there any other featuers you all wod like? What price would you be willing to pay?
<br />
<br />Let me just say that I am looking to sell this product at cost. I am wanting to know what you would be willing to pay so I can get an idea of what features I can implement at the hardware level.
<br />
<br />Thanks for your input!

<br />
<br />Do you plan to allow for both standard and TLSROM-style nametable mirroring?
<br />
<br />Or a switchable fixed bank for multicart use?
<br />
<br />For replication in quantity, how much would it save to leave off the USB access or use a smaller PRG flash?

<br />
<br />My current plan is to implement INES mapper 4 fumctionality only. I do not see how I could implement both mirroring standards while still being compatible with existing software.
<br />
<br />One feature I am considering is adding new registers in the $5000 bank to support features like this, but that really just comes down to how many gates I have left over on the CPLD.
<br />
<br />The USB intrface is a huge part of the cost of the cart. This will not be present on a production cart, nor would battery backed CHR-RAM.
<br />
<br />I won't have a good estimate on the cost of the production cart untill I know how big of a CDLP I need, but I qm hoping to reduce the cost by using SMT parts.

<br />
<br />One can ordinarily assume approximately one CPLD macrocell per bit of state. For an MMC3 clone designed for 2048 KB CHR ROM and 32 KB CHR RAM, I count 44 bits just for the bank numbers:
<br /><ul><li>CHR $0000: 4 bits </li><li>CHR $0800: 4 bits </li><li>CHR $1000: 5 bits </li><li>CHR $1400: 5 bits </li><li>CHR $1800: 5 bits </li><li>CHR $1C00: 5 bits </li><li>PRG $8000/$C000: 8 bits </li><li>PRG $A000: 8 bits </li></ul>Other state: 26+ bits<br /><ul><li>Bank mode and bank register select ($8000): 5 bits </li><li>Mirroring ($A000): 1 bit </li><li>PRG RAM protection ($A001): 2 bits </li><li>IRQ counter reload value ($C000): 8 bits </li><li>IRQ counter: 8 bits </li><li>IRQ acknowledge/enable ($E000/$E001): 2 bits </li><li>Whatever additional bits are needed for the scanline count generation </li></ul>
<br />Now we're up to 70 bits, dangerously close to 72, a size threshold that I remember from somewhere. And unfortunately, 5.0 V CPLDs appear far more expensive according to <a href="http://hackaday.com/2008/12/11/how-to-programmable-logic-devices-cpld/" class="postlink">this</a>.
<br />
<br />Dropping all support for CHR bankswitching saves 31 bits: 28 bank number bits, 1 CHR bank mode bit, and 2 bank register select bits. But you're still above 36, another threshold.

<br />
<br />My HDL design is almost done, so I will know soon enough how many macrocells I will need.
<br />
<br />You hit the nail on the head with the CHRRAM comment. Part of the reason for this thread is to see if I can get away with having no CHRROM support.

And when you get the CPLD done, why only make in lots of 10? Don't you think the price would be way too high to use these instead of $5 donors?

I am fairly confident my market is right around a dozen folks, most of whom visit this board from time to time <img src="./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /> And $5 donors do not have a convenient USB interface. Again my purpose with all of this is to reduce the barrier to entry for folks that may be attracted to the NES dev scene, and for folks wanting to produce production-ready games using MMC3.
<br />
<br />I honestly have not looked into the repro market. That could be a great way to get some orders for the repro version of the board, but that would also involve a lot of "fitness for a particular purpose" type stuff.
<br />

<br />
<br />1) Method of programming.  There's no mention if these are EEPROM boards or what -- just a vague mention of "USB interface for reading and writing all memory space".  I could interpret that as "you can use USB to flash an image to the board", or as "the USB interface acts as a real-time debugger of some sort" (how that would work is beyond me).
<br />
<br />2) Will this thing have a proper/reliable IRQ counter per MMC3B standard?
<br />
<br />3) Will the boards, for $50, include the necessary chips for things like battery-backed SRAM, etc.?  (If not that's fine, just wanting clarification)
<br />
<br />#2 is a deal-breaker for me with regards to purchasing the boards.  No IRQ counter = no buy.

<br />Agreed. Without a scanline counter, the only advantages of TNROM over SUROM are 1. bankswitching of samples at $C000-$DFFF, and 2. slightly faster access to data spread across multiple banks.

<br />Unfortunately, the MMC3 scanline counter is broken by design. All my programs are designed to fetch sprites from both pattern tables, a feature I consider one of the strongest points of the NES, because it allows games to have more diverse graphics.

Consider that this product is intended for developers, and developers will want to use a debugging emulator, so it'd be best to use a mapper that's already well supported in FCEUX and Nintendulator.

<br />One slight problem with using a cycle counter is the authentic PAL NES, whose CPU runs at Fpx/3.2 instead of Fpx/3.

<br />But shouldn't this be solved when you map the same banks of CHR data to both pattern tables (instead of switching pattern tables midscreen we may switch the banks)? Or are there any other benefits in using both tables for the same thing (either sprites or bg tiles)?

<br />
<br />The advantage of 8x16 is that you have 128 different 8x16 pixel graphics for the sprites, plus all 128 pairs of background tiles. With standard MMC3 CHR ROM layout, you have only 128, not 256, distinct graphics available at once. You really only <em>need</em> 64 different graphics when using CHR RAM, but if you go this route, then you have to use up most of your vblank time copying in tiles.
