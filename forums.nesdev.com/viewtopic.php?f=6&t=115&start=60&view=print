		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Alright. I combined them together. I think the PCM frequency in the title theme is slightly lower than what it should be, but I can't make it go any higher without spilling into the next play routine. Probably a result of the PCM routine being tied to the play routine in the NSF. In the game, they are completely seperate - the number of times $4011 is updated between play routines varies slightly, although it's almost constant. I wish I knew how to fix this. Anyway, here's the combined NSF.

<br />
<br />EDIT: I was able to tweak the frequency values a little bit more. It turns out I had an extra cycle in the PCM routine. I replaced a NOPx2 with a STA $xx (where xx is a random unused zero page address) in the PCM routine to fix this. It's still not perfect, but it's better than it was before. I updated the file above to reflect these changes.
<br />
<br />EDIT 2: Wow, I can't count. It turns out I had 11 extra cycles in the PCM routine. I rewrote it to get rid of these extra cycles, which allowed me to tweak the $4011 write loop values a bit higher, making the NSF even closer to what it should be. I'm not sure if it can be improved from here. It should be nearly cycle accurate with the game's PCM routine now. I updated the file above to reflect these changes.

<br />As for Egypt, I've been frequenting your NSF site since you first posted that Rollergames NSF month ago <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /> Egypt is one of my favorites.
<br />As for Contra Force, Kingshriek fixed the DPCM problem, and I think he, very recently, also made a rip for Super Cars as well.
<br />
<br />I love this boom in NSF ripping lately. You guys are my heroes, for real.

<br />
<br />I think New Ghostbusters 2 is one of my older rips. I'm going to check it out and see what the problem is. I can't run NotSoFatSo on my machine so you might be out of luck if the rip still doesn't work after I fix it.

<br />
<br />I think the reason why the NSF didn't work right in other players because it was timing out. 60 is RTS, unless the data was changed somewhere. Good now I don't have to fix it I guess.

<br />By the way Kingshriek, thanks for the Worldrunner rips. I apologize if I come across as sounding really anal here as that's not my intention, but I thought you'd like to know that the ending theme is missing from those rips. 
<br />
<br />Interesting little tidbit on that series. I beat World Runner and its sequel some time ago. The ending theme in both is exactly the same. Hell the whole ending is exactly the same as World Runner's ending, with the dialog being in English and being the same exact words. The only thing changed, is the graphics of the characters. The FDS ending to the original on the other hand is in Japanese and has completely different dialog.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />No problem. I always appreciate corrections/suggestions for any of my rips. The ending theme for the three games uses a completely different play address than the rest of the tracks - hence why I missed it in the initial rips. It was weird to see this in a cartridge game, although it's pretty common for FDS titles - with side A and side B having different play/init addresses. Then again, 3-D World Runner is a from-FDS conversion and its sequel is essentially a hack of it, so I guess it's not so weird in this case.
<br />
<br />Thanks again for notifying me of the missing tracks. The updated rips are below:
