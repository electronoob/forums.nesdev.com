I'm not sure why it would but not on my new menu unless there is an issue with saving or loading of 32K sram games. Does the game ever write to $6000-$7FFF? Though if it worked on the original menu I'd guess it wouldn't have. All I can suggest is try other 32K save games. I think the Pokemon Card GB2 game is one. Wario Land 2 or 3 is as well. If they have saving/loading problems too, then we could be sure it is an issue with 32K saves.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />So I made one 8kb save, &quot;Great Greed&quot;. Made sure it worked, which it did. Then I added Warioland 2, completed a stage. saved, and tried loading the save, which it worked. Then I added Pokemon Card GB 2, made a save with my Warioland 2 and Great Greed saves, tried reloading it and it worked as well. Then I went back and made sure Warioland 2 and Great Greed loaded still, and they did. So I had 2 32kb and 1 8kb save without issues. Still could be Pokemon writing to a bad area, but the menu obviously has an effect on this.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Sorry for the delay in posting, it happens regardless of the slot space it is in. I have read one other post on a pokemon rom hacking forum that this cart does like to corrupt pokemon saves. It was an older post so the problem is probably regards to pokemon and the ems cart and not your menu. Thanks for checking into the issue.<br /><br />It's not a fix exactly but im working on a pokemon gold patch that turns makes the game clock run in sync with the playtime clock, the only thing wrong is the math but I'll post here when it's completed. If anyone is interested in the source <a href="http://slexy.org/raw/s21yaK2qL6" class="postlink">here</a> it is. If you go to those offsets in bgb and copy paste those sections in it'll switch it (this does not remove the mom DST scripting, which i have removed but is not in that code. Its not translatable to machine language as its a custom scripting language, but even if you set the day and DST it shouldnt be an issue.) The time is off by 12 hours since 24 doesnt go into 60 evenly but it gets the job done. When I get a fix for the math done I'll post a fix with the mom scripts removed IF anyone is interested.<br /><br />If you know how to use RGBDS <a href="http://slexy.org/raw/s2O6Ll0uUk" class="postlink">here</a> is a version that compiles in it by stag019, but its commented to get an idea of what the code does.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Hi everyone this is my first post and I hope you excuse me but it is a request for something, hopefully not too much though. The problem that praedo noticed with Zelda's Links Awakening was reproduced with my hardware as well.<br /><br />The problem was completely reproduced (numerous times, numerous flashing of games, numerous frustrating playthroughs!!!) on/with the following:<br /><br />GBA SP ags 101<br />GB USB 64M<br />Legend of Zelda, The - Link's Awakening (U) (V1.2) [!] with Mottzillas *currently* posted (faulty! (but thanks anyway!) <img src="./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" />) Zelda fix....<br /><br />I actually thought there was a problem with the card until I read praedo's post on Zelda Links Awakening and it totally matched my problem. Thankfully it is just the patch.....cannot tell you how relieved I am, thought I was going to have to try and get a drag n derp....mucho $$$! (but I will buy one later)<br /><br /><br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">adam_smasher wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">Alright, no idea if this is causing your problem, but it seems possible.<br /><br />In what is, I think, the map loading routine, it makes bad bankswitches when loading certain maps (in ROM at $2DED). I should have caught this before. <em>Mea culpa</em>. No idea why this usually doesn't screw things up, but...<br /><br />Anyway, given that you seem to be having trouble with map loading, I'd imagine that this is the source of the issue. I still haven't been able to trigger this glitch, but give this new patch a shot and see if it helps. Sorry for doubting you =P<br /><br /><a href="http://www.nottheeconomist.com/zeldambc5fix_new.zip" class="postlink">DOWNLOAD</a></div><br /><br /><br />Can anyone please reupload this latest fix from adam_smasher for Zelda Links Awakening ? The download link seems to have expired for &quot;zeldambc5fix_new.zip&quot;<br /><br /><br />Also let me take this time to say Thank you, I am loving all your work, adam smasher and Mottzilla.<br /><br />Also Thanks to Mottzillas excellent work on GB USB 1.03 I am able to use the GB USB 64M as intended! You basically made this cart usable for me as I probably wouldn't have used it much without your input on 1.03!!! I get some kind of message saying it doesn't have the drivers cuz my drivers have a different name, but it works fine. I'm using Windows 8 64bit btw.<br /><br />Feel free to ask me anything about Zelda Links Awakening (mono version) as I plan to play through the entire game, if I can get the fix. I like to back up my game to the pc every now and then, and when I got bow wow on the chain, the game started not saving properly. I got the white screen, save game gone thing. Exactly like Praedo. When I &quot;read sram&quot;, and opened sav in emulator, my save game would be back at 1st dungeon....it was as if the save wasn't catching or something. Like it never existed...back at 1st dungeon instead of second. Very frustrating til I read this thread!! <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br /><br />Anyway, that's my first post over and done with, sorry if it's a bit jumbled, i just wanted to be thorough and make sure everything was said that was important. I will be visiting this thread from time to time because I am so addicted to the older (best) consoles. Namely NES, SNES and of course, the beloved gameboy.<br />Dave

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Little note to say, my problem with Zelda:<br /><br />As I said before, I played... <br /><br />Legend of Zelda, The - Link's Awakening (U) (V1.2) [!]   <br /><br />...but maybe I should have said that it was the only game on bank 1 (the first bank) with 17 gameboy games (.gb) games in bank 2.<br /><br />If I had more than 1 game in bank 1, then frustratingly colors would then be added to what is supposed to be Monochrome Zelda. Since I wanted to play in Monochrome, I wanted no colors, so that it would be most accurate to the original. Therefore I only had one game in bank 1. BUT I consciously did not ever play the games in bank 2, or allow the cart to boot into bank 2. As I have read that games must use the menu on both banks for the SRAM to be reliable/usable.<br /><br />I was very careful of this, because I knew it would cause a problem. So I always gave it time for the cart to stay settled in bank 1.<br /><br />However having read through all of this thread now, the save problems with the Mono version seem unresolved anyway?<br /><br /><br />.... ...<br />I know I can play DX and I have been, and I got past bow wow and it saved with no problems. But I prefer to play the original Monochrome version, as I don't like the colors or simplified hints that DX has.<br /><br />Has anyone tried Legend of Zelda, The - Link's Awakening (U) (V1.2) [!] on a drag n derp? Would it have the same issues as GB 64?<br /><br />P.S I would still be grateful for the &quot;zeldambc5fix_new.zip&quot; fix even if it just gets me a little further on, for the sake of proving this problem I will play on if I receive it.<br /><br />We just want a GB cart that works don't we? hehe.<br />Dave

I'm guessing all avenues have been exhausted? <br /><br />Mottzilla's custom menu has made the cart that much better but I'm noticing right now it says V 1.0 when I power on my GB. I thought I read there is a V 1.3 out there. Is that true and can anyone point me to where I can find it? Is the Pokemon saved fixed with V 1.3 by chance?<br /><br />I gotta catch 'em all, help!  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=":wink:" title="Wink" />
