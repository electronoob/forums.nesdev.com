<br />Oh dear. Now if I started to act like that, people would be rioting in the streets. I wasn't having a go at you or anything, and I believe that the questions asked in that post are fair and not newbie.

This is one of those trifling things that I wouldn't worry about too much (or even at all) -- as a PPU address change mid-scanline will cause a bit of distortion anyway -- failing to emulate this 100% accurately will result in no worse than 8 pixels of miscoloration that won't be humanly noticable.</div><br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">blargg wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">This is getting into emulation accuracy areas that are absurd to emulate, but it really might matter if you're turning rendering on and off at various points in a scanline. Good luck motivating anyone to run tests on a NES to determine and verify this kind of detail.</div>
<br />
<br />- In case you still didn't get: I <strong>dunno</strong> there's an official doc that would cover such thing (low-level description) to a game developer. A couple of NES games have problems... because they didn't read "d4 m4nu4l5"? <img src="./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" />

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I wouldn't be surprised if there were <em>no</em> documentation of all the NES PPU quirks and fine points, not in Nintendo's possession nor otherwise. Maybe a few engineers who made the PPU were aware of some of them as they designed it, but then forgot later as they were so obscure. Many aspects just occur based on the design they chose in order to meet the explicit requirements, and programmers try to avoid straying outside the well-defined aspects.

<br />
<br />But yeah, I think all of us here collectively know more about the NES chips than probably the individuals who designed the things, heh.
<br />
<br />But for the service manual, there should be plenty more of those around.  Nintendo Service Centers used to be everywhere, in big department stores and stuff.
