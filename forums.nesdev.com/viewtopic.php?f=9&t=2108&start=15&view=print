<br />That is very stupid, since 60-72 pin adapters doesn't defeat copyrighted works at all, they just 'adapt' the game to another connector, and another region lockout just make it to run proprely, since the lockout doesn't even exist on the famicom !

<br />But that qualifies as you running a game that wasn't designed for your region, which is exactly what eBay is trying to prevent. Stupid? Yes.

<br />Yeah, I know. I, for example, like to watch a lot of japanese shows. Does my government care that the DVDs containing such shows are not avaliable for sale here before charging 60% of the value in taxes if I import them? No.
<br />
<br />Nobody really cares if you are or aren't able to obtain the things you like, and that's why most people resort to "illegal" means, such as downloading from the internet for free.

<br />Does this apply to anything containing a lockout defeater (CIClone, Rabbit, etc.), or does it apply only when the defeater is used in a cross-region adapter (as discussed here)?  I hope it's the latter.
<br />
<br />When did that rule go into effect, and were there any 60-&gt;72 pin connectors sold on eBay since?  I'm not an eBay member (my brother is the one who does the eBay stuff in our household, and he isn't around right now), so forgive me if these questions sound dumb.

<br />eBay has several listings for <em>Vindicators</em>, a game published by Tengen that used the Rabbit chip. Given this, I'm guessing it's the latter.
