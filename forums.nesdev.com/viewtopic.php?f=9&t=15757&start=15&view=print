The price includes the cartridge PCB, cartridge shell, 4 GB Micro SD card and USB-MicroSD reader for putting roms into card.<br /><br />The price will probably be the same for the whole Europe, but overseas delievery might be quite more expensive. Also, which I did not mention, the cartridge has possibility of firmware update - just puttin newer version on SD card and chosing it in console like ordinary rom file.<br /><br />More mapper support is not planned, as I was intendent to concentrate only on most popular mappers. Also, the choosen FPGA chip is 95% used.<br /><br /><strong>Feel free to write: krzysiocart(at)gmail.com for ordering or other private inquiries</strong>

So NMI have to be disabled. I could potentially stay with PRG programming routine in RAM and move CHR-RAM writing to be excecuted in ROM and the NMI trick could work. But the way it is done is simpler, but thanks for pointing that - I will consider it in next firmware release.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">I was also considering adding some kind of progress bar</div><br />If you could keep track of time somehow (cycle-based mapper IRQs?) you could have the screen fill with color from the bottom up.

(Same goes for IRQ and Reset.)<br /><br />If you've got to execute PPU updates entirely from RAM you probably need NMI off and just do it by polling? The polling will add some waste time (and occasionally an extra frame), but you wouldn't have to run it every frame, only as often as you want to update the status bar.

Many NES games do that.</div><br /><br />I think the issue you're missing is that you CANNOT read valid data from a flash chip while it's being programmed.  While waiting for the flash chip to complete the write, reading from it will invert some bits, and toggle others of true data.  When that stops happening, it's the flash chip's way of saying when the byte(s) programming is completed.  <br /><br />So you can't read from flash while programming, which means you can't execute from it.  And since you never know when NMI is coming, you can't be sure your not in the middle of a byte programming operation which means the CPU can't fetch the NMI vector from flash.  Well it can try, but it will get a corrupted vector.<br /><br />The only way around this would be if the menu/SDcard mapper was able to place PRG-RAM in the last bank during programming operations and fetch valid vectors from PRG-RAM.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />This cart, due to its huge PRG-ROM size of 4MB, would have the potential to play games that the EverDrive N8 and NES PowerPak, with their 512KB PRG-ROM limits, cannot.  Of course you would need to reporgram the CPLD to support different mappers.  I understand that it cannot fit more mappers because the macrocells and logic elements are almost completely used up, but can it be reprogrammed by software running on the SD card to support different mappers?  Action 52 (Mapper 228), Final Fantasy VII and Pokemon Yellow (Mapper 163) and Action 53 and Streemerz (Mapper 28) all would be possible.  An advantage for sure (sales!) for some who want to play larger games on real hardware.

The way I implemented it is exactly how it is described in nesdev's wiki.<br /><br />Contra-168-in-1 (which is famiclone multiset) was for some reason also assigned mapper 15, but this game does not use the all mapper 15 banking modes. Also, this game in some banking modes protects its CHR-RAM from writing (which was not mentioned in nesdev's wiki). If this is not implemented, Urban Champion will have  garbled letters on title screen.<br /><br />Bio Hazard is also assigned mapper 15, but it hangs just after gameplay starts. There is bug-free version which is assigned mapper 227.<br /><br />Some other chinese games from the same company as BioHazard has also assigned mapper 15.
