I want to see more and more quality NES homebrews being released on cartridges and keeping the NES alive, but when the actual product is harmful to people's consoles, then that's doing the very opposite of keeping the NES alive, it's literally killing consoles little by little, and tarnishing the image of the homebrew community along the way. I don't want Sivak to have problems because of this either, seeing as he probably wasn't aware of any of this, but I think it's important to educate not only consumers about the dangers of certain types of cartridges, but also game developers so they can better pick the companies they make deals with and don't take part in this shady business of selling harmful products.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"><br />Those kind of issues are not found in repro board that I remember when I was more active on nesdev, right?

It's lack of foresight really, because even though they're saving money now, by helping kill the consoles that are still in use they're obliterating the market.<br /><br />There are only so many original consoles still in use, if we don't take good care of them, soon there won't be a market for physical retro game releases anymore.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=95">tokumaru</a> — Wed Aug 15, 2018 10:42 pm</p><hr />

I don't think there's any reason it wouldn't work with such a converter. The main thing that converters usually get wrong (4-screen or other unusual mirroring) isn't something that Battle Kid does. I don't have the Famicom cart to test, though, but from my experience almost everything works anyway.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=5165">rainwarrior</a> — Wed Aug 15, 2018 7:00 pm</p><hr />

The boards for Columbus Circle's first cartridge, 8-bit Music Power, were not just modern pirate quality boards, they failed in more official systems than they worked in.  The board I linked to had no translation Their next release, Kira Kira Star Night DX worked in pretty much any Nintendo-made system but had iffy luck with the Sharp-released stuff.  I do not know if the situation further improved with their next releases, 8-bit Music Power Final and NEO Heiankyo Alien, but I know they were still using 3.3v flash with Kira Kira.  <br /><br />Ultimately, the architecture of the NES makes it rather unattractive for level translators.  Assuming they use 5v parts for the mapper, you still need translators for the two chips.  That's 15 address lines and 8 data lines for the PRG-ROM and and 13 address lines and 8 data lines for the CHR-RAM (Mapper 2).  So unless they are using three 16-line voltage converters, they aren't implementing 3.3v properly without them.  Current limiting resistors aren't good enough.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=58">Great Hierophant</a> — Fri Jul 20, 2018 3:54 pm</p><hr />

There's a chance they improved that aspect, as it really wasn't out in the open at the time 8-bit Music Power was released, and I think most people weren't aware that it could cause any issues.<br />It was famously an issue with the Everdrive too, and as far as I know, Krikzz has been using 5V components from that point on? despite defending the idea that he didn't consider 3.3v components damaging to the system.<br /><br />Actually, the smoking comparison is incredibly apt.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=7819">Sumez</a> — Fri Jul 20, 2018 1:26 am</p><hr />
