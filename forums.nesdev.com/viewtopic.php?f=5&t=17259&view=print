		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I'm aiming to be able to code games in a high-level language (such as Python) in order to get faster development, (typically before the game is eventually converted to assembly and released on proper NES platform).<br /><br />I was looking at the <a href="https://www.pygame.org/news" class="postlink">pygame</a> library; the problem is that they use images directly to put on the screen. I still managed to code some sprite rendering routines so it's possible to do it manually but it's extremely slow and it'd be very hard to have an NTSC filter on this.<br /><br />Is there an easy to use library where it's possible to code games and use a NTSC filter on top of it ?

But it really depends on what you want to achieve. A perfect emulation of the whole NES featureset sounds cumbersome, for example. It should work well to test graphics and physics but that’s about it.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />NTSC is usually composite nowadays, except for the case of a cable box where the subscriber hasn't paid the high definition surcharge to Comcast. Did you mean VGA to composite, or HDMI to composite, or something else?<br /><br />Besides, the shape of the artifacts depends on the number of color subcarrier cycles in a scanline. I think these scan converter boxes like the one depicted in <a href="https://pineight.com/mw/index.php?title=Cable_finder" class="postlink">my article</a> use standard 227.5-cycle timing, compared to nonstandard 227.333-cycle timing used by the NES and Super NES and the different nonstandard 228-cycle timing used by the Apple II, Atari products, and Sega products.

For something like NES resolution, I  would probably only involve the GPU for the final stretch to fill the user's native screen (which is a perfect time for an NTSC filter too.)<br /><br />The NTSC filter is probably ideally for the GPU, but an efficient software one like blargg's isn't that bad at all.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">Bregalad wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">If you really want to, you could write your game against Libretro, then run it in RetroArch.

It handles the main interface, menus, the final screen compositing step (upscaling filters, including NTSC simulation), etc. so that all the emulators have the same front-end feel and you can switch between them easily. So the suggestion was that you could make a game as a DLL plugin for this.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />It should be a fun exercise to implement reading and displaying of NES compatible CHR sets, nametables and palette files in gamemaker. It can read binary files just fine!<br />There's also a free chiptune plugin that plays back NSF files and there are screen shaders that you can use/program to simulate the NTSC filter.<br />It also already has a tileset environment to work on which you can set to 8x8.<br />As for palettes to work it would probably require writing an image buffer yourself (in gamemaker they are called surfaces).<br />The problem with gamemaker is that it isn't free, and the coding isn't centralized in one &quot;main&quot; function, meaning the order of execution between different objects isn't reliable inside each frame, so it takes a bit getting used to it.

It's a bit more work to get set up but maximally flexible. Non-performance-critical parts I'd do straight in Python (e.g., window management and using OpenGL to display the framebuffer -- maybe just best to use something like <a href="https://pysdl2.readthedocs.io/en/rel_0_9_6/" class="postlink">PySDL2</a>).

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />One problem I recently ran into with PySDL2 is that it does <em>not</em> give the user a way to extract the contents of a surface to a byte string. Without that, I couldn't find a way to pass frames to FFmpeg when encoding a replay to video. From <a href="https://pysdl2.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorial/pygamers.html#pygame-image" class="postlink">PySDL2 for Pygamers</a>:<br /><br /><blockquote style="margin-left: 1%; padding-left: 1%; border-left: 3px solid #555577;">
<tt style="margin-left: 2px; margin-right: 2px; padding:3px; background-color: #3355aa; color: white;">tostring&#40;&#41;</tt>: No equivalent yet
</blockquote><br /><br />The other is the fact that its sole official tutorial, to make a <a href="https://pysdl2.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorial/pong.html" class="postlink">clone of Atari's <em>Pong</em></a>, is built around a strict component-oriented programming (COP) model that forbids an object to own more than one object of a given type, as the name of the field is literally the lowercased type name. This is <a href="https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/larryosterman/2004/06/22/hugarian-notation-its-my-turn-now/" class="postlink">Systems Hungarian</a> taken to its illogical conclusion.<br /><br />The Ren'Py project's <a href="https://github.com/renpy/pygame_sdl2" class="postlink">pygame_sdl2</a> attempts source compatibility with Pygame, but its README notes the important lack of &quot;APIs that expose pygame data as buffers or arrays.&quot; In addition, because indexed images are considered &quot;legacy formats&quot; unworthy of first-class support other than as a source for load-time conversion, there's no good way to palette-swap things at runtime without generating a separate 32bpp texture for each entry in the indexed image's palette.<br /><br />That's why I stuck with the SDL 1.2-based Pygame for that project once Pygame had been updated for Python 3.
