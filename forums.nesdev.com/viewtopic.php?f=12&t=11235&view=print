		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />While i am waiting for my parts to arrive from china for the MBC project, i am doing some research on some stuff on the SNES.<br /><br />So, I was doing research on whether i could just put a 29L3211 into a cart with the same pinout and if there is going to be any damage to either the cart or the flash chip that does absolutely not support voltage higher than 3,8V. I came across a thread that mentions that it will not last long until the chip is going to malfunction due to the overvoltage on its inputs.<br /><br /><br />I came across the solution of using some kind of logic level converter to convert SNES 5V signal to 3,3V signal of the flash, but this would involve a heavy rewiring job. <br /><br />Wouldnt resistors do the job for level converting? I thought of a voltage divider with 100ohm and 200ohm resistors to get about 3,3V from a 5V source. The connection would be like this:<br /><br />AddressOut 5Vsource---100ohmResistor---AddressIn 3,3V(flash Chip)---200ohmResistor---GND<br /><br />-&gt;Between the resistors would then be the 3,3V Out which connects to the addressinput of the flash chip.<br />I thought of using SMD resistors with Form factor 0603, which could easily fit on a soldering pad on a pcb.<br /><br /><br />Thanks in advance for anyone who is able to help.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />The SNES will not be harmed by receiving data from that's at 3V CMOS logic levels.<br /><br />However, the 3V ROM cannot have its data bus connected to the SNES's 5V data bus without damaging both the ROM (overvoltage) and the SNES (signal line loading), and a voltage divider won't work there because the ROM needs to drive the output strongly (and resistors would prevent that).<br /><br />Voltage dividers on ROM inputs will draw current from the address lines ALL the time, which is bad. A static current larger than ~1mA from a signal line is Bad and could eventually damage the SNES. 100Ω+200Ω=300Ω ; 5V÷300Ω=17mA. While using substantially larger resistors (say, 3.3kΩ and 6.8kΩ) sounds like it should work, and INL's SNES reproduction board uses it for four of the address lines, some people have warned me off it.<br /><br />It damages the ROM because all ROMs have overvoltage protection diodes on almost all pins <span style="font-size: 50%; line-height: normal">(sometimes not A9 for historical reasons)</span> that go to their Vcc and from ground (so that voltages above Vcc are dumped onto the Vcc rail, and voltages below ground are dumped onto the ground rail). Even if the 3V regulator is good enough to keep the ROM's power rail at 3V, these diodes work out to be the preferred path to power the ROM, and then it will draw the entirety of power needed to power the ROM from the signal lines, damaging the SNES. And, if the current isn't limited by a resistor or level converted, you could exceed the ability of the regulator to control the supply voltage below what the ROM can accept. Finally, not all voltage regulators protect their output against overvoltage.<br /><br />Another experiment that one occasionally hears about involves just using a resistor array as current limiters, and intentionally using the overvoltage diodes in the ROM at some very low current (say 500µA or less). The diodes are not designed for continuous use, so one of them could eventually fail, and then overvoltage could damage the device.<br /><br />But even if all that weren't true, the inputs are most likely not made with a technology that is designed to withstand a voltage higher than 3.8V, possibly causing things like dielectric breakdown of the inputs' MOSFET gates.

I don't know where that is, though.

You'll really need some kind of IC here, whether a level-shifting octal buffer or one of the GTL2xxx/NVT2xxx transistor clamps.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />A valid approach to the problem, which I myself implemented on a homemade board, is to use <strong>100KOhm</strong> resistors in A-1 to A20 going into 29L3211 (22 address lines in byte mode), so you shift 5V (even less since voltage losses in the cartridge edge) to 3V. There aren't timing issues since 29L3211 is asynchronous and adress is latched up far after all address lines are stable (the input latch enable is decoded from /CE and /OE).<br />The data lines are level-shifted by a 3V-tolerant input octal bus transceiver with tri-state outputs, this way assuring 5V data level reaches the SNES CPU in all data bus lines.

This seems to be the safest way of doing it. Now on a special mapper Cart like the SA-1 or the SDD-1, does the Rom run in 16bit mode or in 8bit mode? Would be useful to know, so i can get the proper level shifter.<br /><br />Anyway, thanks so far for the input.
