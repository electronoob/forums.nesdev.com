It is there to teach you that you can drop through certain floor types, which comes in handy later on. A sharp tutorial is however having the characteristic that in order to pass, you must succeed. I think it is generally good practice to provide the player with a &quot;soft&quot; tutorial element before a sharp one. Think of how SMB1 world 1-1  teaches the player to jump over obstacles in a safe environment, then jump over deadly pits. A soft tutorial in this case could be something like this (excuse the sloppy ms paint work):<br /><div class="attachtitle">Attachment:</div><div class="attachcontent">

			<span class="gensmall">softtutorial.png [ 3.04 KiB | Viewed 1634 times ]</span>
		

		<br />
	</div><br />Notice that nothing else is there, just the few collectables, so you won't misdirect focus towards a wall or other obstructing structure of interest. Enemies or hills or other decor would be fine, of course. This helps ease the reliance on manuals, readmes, etc, so the game can be played the first time without the risk of interruption or necessity of preparation. <br /><br />EDIT: Alternatively or additionally, you could place a jalapeno at the bottom of rainwarriors' screen to direct attention of the player away from walking to the right. <br /><br />There's another place which could benefit from a softening, too. In the (spoiler) underground passage where you find your first 1up, it is hard to calculate how the low ceiling affects the jump the first time(s). The first pit could be narrower, or there could be some jumping excercise prior to that, or something.<br /><br />The castle music was a good fit for the scenes and pretty cool sounding! The graphics are about the cutest thing in a while.  <br />I think everything in the game felt very good, from jumping mechanics to enemy placement to progression of difficulty to change of scenes.  Except for the moving platforms. It's always a personal grief when moving platforms don't ease in and out of their turning points in platformer games. Somewhere between SMB1 and a sharp turn could be just right, maybe?<br />  <br />The castle could *maybe* benefit from the first narrow platform jump to be one 16x16 tile wider, also to ease in the difficulty of the narrower ones. <br /><br />Otherwise, this feels very well produced. Congratulations!

There's one &quot;big heart&quot; that you need it to get (slightly past this point), but other than that, for the rest of the game it doesn't seem to be important?<br /><br /><br />I notice very often a single line of pixels disappears from sprites, and it seems that it's because when the head bobs down you now overlap by one pixel, putting 4 sprites on a scanline. I realize it conserves CHR, but since so much stuff happens on the plane of action with the dragon, it might be worth dedicating a few tiles to the head-down sprite?<br /><br />Hmm, seems like the problem is compounded by the fireball sprite also overlapping the lower half by one pixel too, guess that'd be harder to deal with.<br /><br />Actually, if you moved the &quot;tail&quot; part of the lower half of the sprite as high as it can go within the CHR tile (and then lower its sprite tile position) you could move one tile out of this critical line of overlap, at least?<br /><br /><br />Anyhow, very nice game. Thanks for sharing!

It also sees some use in the castle. <br /><br />On sprite priority, i wonder whether the status bar objects should have the current priority (high) - this is mainly a cosmetic problem in one specific area in the castle.

I figured out up+fire without help... though it could probably benefit from a similar tutorial. Maybe a sign with an up arrow+B next to a red pepper and a tough enemy blocking your path?<br /><br /><br />I liked the boss name &quot;Cactus Clay&quot;, though I dunno how many people remember the name Cassius Clay these days.
