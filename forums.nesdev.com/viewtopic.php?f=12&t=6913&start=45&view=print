<br />I'm not sure about the SNES, but on the NES I think that would be kinda hard to do. If I had a lot of free CPU time, I'd first think of simply running an extra logic frame after 5 frames on a PAL console, but that would screw up the VRAM updates, which usually have RAM for only 1 frame worth of updates. Another option would be to use different physics constants for each type of console, but since we use fixed-point numbers, even the smallest rounding errors could result in the game behaving too differently.
<br />
<br />Sik, if you don't mind me asking, what method did you use on the MD to compensate for the speed difference?

<br />On the NES, you sometimes have to reduce the precision of your fixed-point arithmetic to fit a world coordinate into 16 bits (two machine words). For example, <a href="http://games.greggman.com/game/programming_m_c__kids/" class="postlink">one platformer</a> uses quarter pixels as its fundamental unit (Q14.2). On the Super NES, two machine words are 32 bits, and you can use Q16.16 coordinates even if your map is 256 screens wide. But as you point out, the trouble would come from testing every jump in the game on both versions to see which ones the player can make or not make. I seem to remember this being noticeable in some Quake engine game, in which the player can make the most difficult rocket jumps only at specific frame rates. And you might have to accept the fact that <a href="http://super-smash-bros.wikia.com/wiki/PAL_tier_list" class="postlink">character balance will differ</a>.

<br />
<br />Tepples, his post implies that any animation not aligned to even frames will be impossible. Project MD has lots of animations with sprites lasting 3 frames, for example.

<br />Because of other updates that also need VBlank time.
<br />
<br />I don't think that this is a mandatory thing for the SNES, it's just his engine that was designed that way. I too have limitations like these in my CHR-RAM NES game. I even have to double buffer the main character's tiles, since they can only be updated all at once if no other VRAM update is necessary for a frame.

<br />
<br />My old engine uploaded 64 16x16 sprite cells over 2 consecutive frames (32 cells each) with the other 64 sprites using permanant v-ram sprite patterns.
<br />
<br />My new engine is a little bit simpler.  It uploads 96 16x16 sprite cells over 2 consecutive frames (48 cells each) without using any permanant v-ram sprite patterns.
<br />
<br />But they both rely on the same double buffer, 1-frame-oam-delay method that I came up with.  Both versions have advantages and disadvantages, but the second method doesn't take as much thinking when you want to add in a new character or object.
