		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />So, I'm doing a bit of bug hunting in my GB emulator, and I figured I should start off with some problems affecting specific DMG games. I thought <a href="http://www.gamefaqs.com/gameboy/570029-mortal-kombat-and-mortal-kombat-ii/data" class="postlink">Mortal Kombat &amp; Mortal Kombat II</a> would be simple enough as a starting point, but it turns out this isn't the case. Allow me to explain.<br /><br />This game is a compilation of the 1st and 2nd MK games for the DMG, so it uses a menu after the copyright and publisher info screens. Selecting either MK1 or MK2 from the menu, however, always restarts the game back to the copyright and publisher screens. Start, Select, A, B, doesn't matter what's pressed; the result is the same, just an endless loop without the game starting.<br /><br />Now, at first, I dismissed this (the issue was reported to my project) as a bad dump, but when I checked with another source, the dump they used was clean (as far as the MD5 hash indicates) and it exhibited the same problems in my emulator, in BGB, and in VBA-M. What's even stranger is that they put MK &amp; MKII on a flashcart and played it on a real Game Boy, only to have the same menu-loop problem occur on real hardware. My next thoughts were that maybe no one has been able to get a clean &amp; verified dump of this game before (unlikely, but hey, it could happen).<br /><br />Unfortunately, I don't think that's the case. I stumbled upon <a href="http://www.ebay.com/itm/Mortal-Kombat-Mortal-Kombat-II-Nintendo-Game-Boy-Cart-Only-HAS-ISSUE-READ-/172032740527?hash=item280df34caf:g:czEAAOSwbdpWZiCL" class="postlink">this ebay page</a> as I was looking to buy this game myself. So, looks like actual production carts had bugs in them too. Evidently, this isn't an issue of emulation or getting complete ROM data from the physical cart; it seems like something larger...<br /><br />So here are my current thoughts:<br /><br />1) Maybe they goofed when making a number of MK &amp; MKII carts. A number of them might have defects that make the game unplayable.<br />2) Maybe they aren't really using an MBC1, maybe something different that neither flashcarts nor emulators can handle? But that doesn't explain why commercial carts have the issue, unless something inside the cart breaks down over time. But how would that affect dumping it properly?<br />3) Maybe something inside the cart is defective (something to do with the MBC itself) but the ROM image is still usable, e.g. the ROM banks need to be rearranged after using a dumping tool?<br /><br />Any thoughts from others are appreciated. If you know anything about this game, let me know. Thanks everyone  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=":wink:" title="Wink" />

As far as licensed games go, you can get away with it because headers contain valid data (aside maybe for a few games with invalid SRAM headers, but those get given away the moment they try to access it). As soon as you enter unlicensed territory you can't trust the ROM anymore since a lot of those have their own custom registers unique to them (ugh!). I really hope people doing homebrew don't attempt to do this because there's still a good chunk of free space in the official header yet &gt;=/ (but good luck getting people to not use the default header their devkit comes with!)

For example, if you change one byte, the hash changes<br /></div><br /><br />Personally, I think trying to automatically detect edge cases like this is the wrong approach. For the vast majority of games that work by reading the cart header, auto-detection is great, but for something like MK 1&amp;2, I think it's best to have a one-off option (either command-line or GUI) and label it something like &quot;Emulate MBC1 Collection Cart (MK 1&amp;2)&quot;. Then, whenever the user wants to run a game that needs this edge case, they have to manually and explicitly enable it for the current ROM being loaded. If they want to play another MBC1 game, they have to disable it (the GUI can remind them if need be, or they can just deal with it...)<br /><br />I know it's a hassle for the end user, but if the scope is limited to a few games, I don't see a problem. It becomes one of those situations where the user goes &quot;Oh, I want to emulate XYZ game, but I have to check this special option for it to work.&quot; It's not all that uncommon in other emulators (specifically thinking of PCSX2's hacks, and some options buried within Dolphin) and it saves me the pain of trying to find out if the user is running some exotic game.<br /><br />So, instead of an automatic approach, they'd just do it themselves. They'd have to be smart enough to read the README about known issues, but other than that, I'd take the emulator out of the equation when it comes to choosing whether the game is MK 1&amp;2 or not. As long as there are not hundreds of these kinds of cases, it's manageable.

That won't stop someone determined, but given the history of Game Boy pirate carts, it seems like big-name games and 1000000000-in-1 types games were most common, and the lesser common ones had completely incorrect labels as a dead giveaway more often than not.<br /><br />Though if there are other visual cues I missed that might indicate a pirate cart in the ebay link, I'd love to know.

We've got standard boards and boards that deviate slightly. Who knows if the PCB on this board even has its own code. Plenty of NES games do this rewiring/substitution act with no serial distinguishment.</div><br /><br />As I understand it, GB carts are much saner than NES or SNES when it comes to headers in a vast majority of cases. It's just a limited number of edge-cases that pop up. Still, I agree that databases are important. If there was a single place I could have looked up detailed info about MK 1&amp;2, I probably wouldn't have made this thread. Instead, I've had to piece together bits of info from Google searches and advice from others familiar with these kinds of tricky games.<br /><br />I'll just take this moment (yet again, for the N<sup>th</sup> time) to complain about how poor Game Boy documentation is, especially in regards to something like more exotic MBC variants. If you want to know more about the MBC7, for example, good luck. You'll need to pick apart mostly uncommented code (most of it tracing their origins to VBA-M) to figure out what's going on. I can't stress enough how many times I find things about the Game Boy that have only been documented as emulator source code with sparse comments. In my opinion, source code is only ever half of what proper documentation looks like. It's the implementation, which is helpful, but not the actual schematic. Things need to be written in Plain-Old-English so everyone can understand what's going on without having to dissect code.<br /><br />It's a huge pet-peeve of mine. I hate it when emulators like MAME or Gambatte does something (in this case, support for MBC1 &quot;multicarts&quot;) but fail to explicitly write out how it functions. I had to parse Gambatte (MAME's code was not helpful, or at least not as clear as it could have been) to figure out how MK 1&amp;2 works. For the sake of others, I'm going to share the results here so no one has to scratch their heads anymore. <br /><br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">//MBC1 &quot;multicart&quot; writeable registers<br />0x2000 - 0x3FFF: Lower 5 bits of the ROM bank (Bits 0-4)<br />0x4000 - 0x5FFF: Upper 2 bits of the ROM bank (Bits 5-6)<br />0x6000 - 0x7FFF: &quot;Multicart&quot; mode select bit<br /><br />As far as I can tell, MBC1 multicarts do not have cart RAM. What normally is the ROM/RAM banking mode bit at 0x6000 - 0x7FFF instead switches the MBC into a &quot;multicart&quot; mode. In this mode, half of the available banks (0x3F) can be accessed. Even though something like Mortal Kombat 1&amp;2 appears to use 1MB of data, it only really has 512KB worth of data on its cart. A lot of those banks are blank data (0xFF). In &quot;multicart&quot; mode, unlike most MBCs, ROM0 can actually be replaced with another bank (0x0, 0x10, 0x20, or 0x30). As a result, unlike MBC1s, the multicart versions can access Bank 0x20 by setting ROM0 to it. ROM1 cannot access 0x20, however (or 0x40 or 0x60 for that matter).<br /><br />When entering multicart mode, ROM0 gets switched with another bank using the following formula (assume ROM_BANK is the full ROM bank number using all 7 bits from 0x2000 through 0x5FFF)<br /><br />ROM_BANK = ((ROM_BANK &gt;&gt; 1) &amp; 0x30) <br /><br />So essentially, in multicart mode, ROM0 banks translate as follows:<br />Banks 0x0 through 0x1F = 0x0<br />Banks 0x20 through 0x3F = 0x10<br />Banks 0x40 through 0x5F = 0x20<br />Banks 0x60 through 0x7F = 0x30<br /><br />When entering multicart mode, ROM1 gets switched with another bank using the following forumla:<br /><br />ROM_BANK =&nbsp; ((ROM_BANK &gt;&gt; 1) &amp; 0x30)&nbsp; | (ROM_BANK &amp; 0xF)<br /><br />So essentially, in multicart mode, ROM1 banks translate as follows:<br />Banks 0x0 through 0x1F = 0x0 - 0xF, then 0x0 - 0xF again<br />Banks 0x20 through 0x3F = 0x10 - 0x1F, then 0x10 - 0x1F again<br />Banks 0x40 through 0x5F = 0x20 - 0x2F, then 0x20 - 0x2F again<br />Banks 0x60 through 0x7F = 0x30 - 0x3F, then 0x30 - 0x3F again<br /><br />When multicart mode is disabled, ROM banking works just like a regular MBC1, as far as I can tell.<br /><br />On a final side-note, when changing the ROM0 by writing a new ROM bank number or flipping the multicart mode bit in 0x6000 through 0x7FFF, most games jump to code in WRAM before doing so. This makes sense because switching out ROM0 means you get new interrupt handling code at 0x40, 0x48, etc... ROM1 also changes its bank, so the only &quot;safe&quot; spot to switch banks is in WRAM to avoid accidentally executed random code.<br /></div><br /><br />I haven't looked at the PCB (I can't read electronics or anything like that) but this gets MK 1&amp;2 working. It would be best if someone verified that's how actual hardware works. But I'm sick of documentation not being written out explicitly.

I intend to properly check the traces, but won't have much time to do that before the weekend.
