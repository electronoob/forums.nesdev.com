<br />The archive contains two iNES ROMs, the asm source, and sound files of the output when run on a NES. Reply if you get a different result than expected.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />both of them are working for me now... although I had to add a tweak to get sweep_cutoff to work.
<br />
<br />For the most part it played as expected... only notes *very briefly* played before the noise signal (when you're not supposed to hear anything).  I mean briefly as in it's only making 1 full square briefly -- it sounded mostly like a pop (or really several pops since it's happening on each test).
<br />
<br />My previous method is I have a flag which indicates if the sweep unit is silencing the channel (1 if channel is silenced by sweep unit, 0 otherwise).  I refreshed the value by checking the conditions on every $4001/2/3 write...as well as on sweep unit clocks.
<br />
<br />The tweak I added makes it so the flag can only go from 1-&gt;0 on Sweep Unit clocks... meaning if the sweep unit is silenceing the channel... it will always be silent until at least the next sweep unit clock.
<br />
<br />The tweak fixed sweep_cutoff.... but I'm not sure on it's accuracy.  Could you verify for me?  Is that what I'm supposed to be doing or am I doing something else wrong?

<br />
<br />Definitely incorrect, since silencing has no relation to clocking. The only thing clocking does is drive the actual sweeping (adjusting the period in third and fourth registers).
<br />
<br />Here's the code I use for sweep handling (which matches what is described in the APU reference). Note the comment in clock_sweep() about the different behavior of the second square channel.

<br />
<br />If bSweepForceSilence is ever on, the channel is silenced and output is 0.  CheckSweepForcedSilence() is also called at the end of 4002 and 4003 writes (whenever the frequency changes -- could this be the problem?  perhaps it's only supposed to be checked on 4001 writes?)
<br />
<br />I'm gonna look into what's going on more and see if I can't figure out my problem

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Initially, my emulator was not producing proper results - the first test had one single sweep before the burst of noise (the rest was fine), and the 2nd test didn't play everything in the same pitch. FCE Ultra has similar problems, though the first test had even more noise at the beginning.
<br />
<br />It turns out I was running the half-frame stuff (i.e. sweeps) on quarter-frames 1 and 3 rather than 0 and 2 - changing this immediately fixed the results on both tests.
<br />
<br />Looking at the <a href="http://nesdev.com/wiki/?page=APU+Frame+Counter" class="postlink">APU Frame Counter</a> wiki page, the frame sequences seem wrong somehow - are these taking into account the fact that writing $4017 starts the 4-frame sequence after one quarter frame versus starting the 5-frame sequence <strong>immediately</strong>?
<br />
<br />If you could come up with some proper tests to verify all of that behaviour, we emulator authors would greatly appreciate it.

<br />
<br />For example the demo does the following writes (status of bSweepForceSilence is in parenthesis):
<br />
<br />A1 -&gt; 4001 (1)
<br />07 -&gt; 4002 (1)
<br />00 -&gt; 4003 (1)
<br />F1 -&gt; 4002 (0)  * here
<br />07 -&gt; 4003 (1)
<br />
<br />The few short cycles between the 4002 write and 4003 write, the channel is outputting nonzero... creating the pop.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Disch, sorry about the slight pops that the ROM makes. I looked at the asm earlier today and saw that it does create them because I'm setting the sweep shift a few cycles <em>after</em> changing the period; setting it before keeps the silencing in effect continuously. Maybe the pops are louder on your emulator due to the method of band-limiting you use (averaging). I'll make sure future sound test ROMs generate more unambiguous output.
<br />
<br />Quietust, I would like to make comprehensive sound test ROMs that help find subtle sound issues, since they can have a significant effect on sound effect accuracy. Test ROMs would also serve to double-check the current understanding of APU operation.
<br />
<br />I'd like to also make identical test NSFs for players, but making the tests into a routine that gets called 60 times a second and returns each time will be more difficult. I'm not sure if NSF players can handle an NSF whose init routine never returns. Disch, do you know of any NSFs that never return from their init or play routines, just sit there in a loop handling timing themselves?
<br />
<br />Regarding the frame counter, I've edited the NesDevWiki page to be (hopefully) clearer about the delay for the 4-step sequence and lack of one for the 5-step sequence. In the side effects for a write to $4017, I rewrote it to "The sequencer is restarted at step 1 of the selected mode. If mode is 1 the sequencer is then clocked, causing the first step to be carried out <em>immediately</em>. Finally, the divider is reloaded, resulting in a 1/240 second delay before the sequencer is next clocked."

<br />
<br />Not very many.  The only ones I know of (that intentionally don't return from the Play routine) are ones that do timed $4011 writes... and even then it's only a few tracks on the whole NSF.  First one that comes to mind is Mitokoumon.  Xod did that TMNT theme song dealie with an NSF as well (did the whole TMNT cartoon theme song through $4011 streaming).  I think Blades of Steel has a few tracks too...
