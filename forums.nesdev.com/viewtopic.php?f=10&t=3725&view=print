As a result, I've got <a href="http://griever.ucoz.ru/files/Bee52Griever.rar" class="postlink">this</a>. As you can see This patch changes Font loading part, so uncompressed font is now at 0x4D in ROM, so I've began to repaint it, of course... And BANG! Game Crashes! I couldn't believe it - I thought it was impossible. Arright - just open ROM in tile moelester or something and delete blank red(second color) tile(I mean, make it black)  - you'll see. So, as far as I can say, the problem somewhhere near code:
<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">$E6CF:2C 02 20&nbsp; BIT $2002 = #$20<br />$E6D2:50 FB&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;BVC $E6CF<br />$E6D4:A9 81&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;LDA #$81; this command is never executed</div>
<br />Strange thing, cause the difference only in GFX data loaded...  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_question.gif" alt=":?:" title="Question" />  [/url]

<br />Dunno... I've never senn something like this before. I tried to ask 'bout it <a href="http://nesdev.com/bbs/viewtopic.php?t=3347&amp;start=30" class="postlink">here</a>. There I've also included IDA Lising. I just couldn't figure out what it as by myself, so I've also asked at couple of forums - and nothing... Plus even if i could write unpacker, it would be much harder (impossible? =)) to write the actual packer.

<br />Compression is something that really interests me... but I don't have the patience to trace the decompression code... it seems like too much work! =) But, just for curiosity, since you seem to think the compression in this game is very efficient, can you give me an idea of how good it is? Do you have any compression ratios to share?

<br />Well... As far as I know from Code/Data Logger:
<br />
<br />start screen GFX: Comp-0x584 bytes; UnComp-0x9D0 bytes; Ratio- 1,78
<br />font GFX:Comp- 0x13F bytes;  UnComp- 0x290 bytes;  Ratio- 2,06
<br />
<br />Don't know... Is it good or bad?

I saw they had a function to load 1 bit from the input data, and another to read 2 bits.

<br />Fonts should be easy to compress because usually they use only one of the bitplanes. I'm not sure about Bee52, but with such a good compression ratio I'd guess this is the case.
<br />
<br />EDIT: I just noticed the link is dead. If you are interested I can upload again, as soon as I find the exact file...

This was pretty well documented. This seems hard to encode efficiently, as you'd have to try every type of compression for each byte and see what works best.<br /><br />The compression schemes used in Sonic games are also very interesting (the Mega Drive ones, as the SMS ones just seem to use simple RLE). They have 3 or 4 different formats, each used in differenttypesof data (level maps, graphics, music, etc). The most interesting one is some sort of LZSS optimized to encode small runs ofrepeated bytes, IIRC. gotta check that out again.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">Why not? It's interesting...</div><br />I'll upload it to a more permanent place in a few minutes... The compression ratio for the CHR I tried was about 1.5 to 1.6... The decompressor written in 6502 assembly will output the data to $2007, but I should probably make a version that outputs to regular RAM.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">tepples wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">Fact: RLE is nothing more than the special case of LZ with a 1-byte window.</div>
<br />You are right. The cool thing about LZ is that, being a step up from RLE, it has built-in RLE support.

<br />
<br />I tested it a bit, and I'm not so sure it performs that well anymore... This is just a generic compression algorithm, so it'd be no surprise if it didn't do very well with NES tiles.
<br />
<br />I'm still thinking of a way to make better use of the 2D redundancy present in the tiles... generic compression algorithms are 1D, and will ignore that.
<br />
<br />If I have the time I'll take another look at that Bee52 code.
