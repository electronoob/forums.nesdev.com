<br />
<br />I think you would have to redo the stages then,   which may or may not be worth your while.    But I'm not that far advanced on rom hacking,  there may be a way to import levels.   I'd actually love to hear of it if there is.

<br />The only reason your comment might be rude is that his mistake was already pointed out and acknowledged, so there was no reason to bring it up again.
