Including this information in the NES 2.0 header may be a practical solution after all, as discussed <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/viewtopic.php?f=3&amp;t=17213&amp;start=15#p216147" class="postlink">in a related thread</a> from which this topic is a spin-off.<br /><br /><strong>Status quo:</strong><br /><a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/viewtopic.php?f=3&amp;t=10183&amp;start=15#p113727" class="postlink">&quot;[t]he NES 2.0 file represents the function of everything inside the Game Pak shell.

This means that either the user has to configure input devices himself, or an emulator needs to use a hash table to automatically select them to make a game playable as opposed to merely run it in attract mode. The first solution is not user-friendly, the second option neither emulator- nor ROM-hack-friendly.<br /><br />Edit: Updated proposal <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/viewtopic.php?f=3&amp;t=17213&amp;p=220624#p220624" class="postlink">here</a>.

On the other hand, I think you've indirectly pointed out that maybe there's an argument for a &quot;Vaus and Data Recorder&quot; entry.<br /><br />(I agree that two Zappers on one touchscreen poses all sorts of problems, but then Sour's argument remains)

Arkanoid II would just get an &quot;Two Arkanoid Vaus controllers in Famicom expansion port&quot; entry for byte 15. An emulator would simply temporarily unmount the Vaus controllers and connect the emulated Data Recorder while the tape is recording/playing (which will always have to be user-initiated) and automatically re-mount the Vaus controllers afterwards.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Most Japanese-developed games are compatible with the Famicom four player adapter just to use as alternative controllers for Player 1 and Player 2.  Even Super Mario Bros will use either player 1 or player 3.<br /><br />Remember that the built-in hardwired controllers are really short, and developers did what they could to support external controllers.<br /><br />Games developed by US or European companies often did not support using Famicom Player 3 or Player 4's controllers.<br /><br />So I think there should be another entry: Two NES/Famicom controllers, but also using Famicom Four-Player adapter as an alternative for the main controllers.  This is about documenting the games, and that's what the games do.  It will probably end up being the most frequent joypad option.  You'll be surprised just how many games support using Player 3's controller.
