It appears they didn't sue them for the emuator, they sued them for using screenshots on the box? Bleem won on all counts though. Its good legal precedent.

The problem is that it encouraged players to stay on the Dreamcast and that obviously was counterproductive for Sony.<br /><br />Not like it was needed anyway because the Dreamcast died as soon as the PS2 was merely <em>announced</em> (all developers jumped ship simultaneously...).

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Because I'm not a lawyer, most of this is probably wrong in some subtle way, so please run it by your own lawyer first:<br /><br />There are two different copyrighted works involved. One is the composition (called a &quot;musical work&quot; in the U.S. copyright statute) and the sound recording (the sound of a particular performance of the composition). The first sound recording of a given composition to be published is produced under license from the composition's copyright owner; subsequent recordings may be produced under a &quot;statutory license&quot; paid through a collecting society. The DPH games don't copy the sound recording, but they do copy the composition. Use of a copyrighted composition in an &quot;audiovisual work&quot; (motion picture or video game) ordinarily needs a &quot;sync&quot; license from the composition's copyright owner. Unlike a statutory license for a plain recording, sync licenses are purely negotiated, and copyright owners are under no obligation to grant a sync license. To use an existing recording in an audiovisual work, one needs both a master license for the recording and a sync license for the underlying composition.<br /><br />You mentioned fair use, which the U.S. copyright statute defines in <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/107" class="postlink">17 USC 107</a>. Given that DPH games use a cover version of an entire song, I don't see how it qualifies under &quot;the amount and substantiality of the portion used in relation to the copyrighted work as a whole&quot;. And given the common practice of negotiating sync licenses, I don't see how it qualifies under &quot;the effect of the use upon the potential market for or value of the copyrighted work&quot;.<br /><br />The one thing worse than a cease-and-desist letter is a demand letter, which could bankrupt you because if you don't pay up, they'll sue. The music industry is known for using demand letters (<em>Capitol v. Thomas</em>). Again, I'd recommend getting a lawyer if you're going to be relying on a fair use defense for distributing DPH as a launch title for Ouya.<br /><br />When I made Thwaite, on the other hand, I tried to make its music sound like parts of the Animal Crossing soundtrack, but I built it out of similar-sounding pieces taken from a composition by someone who's been dead more than 100 years: Ludwig van Beethoven's Piano Sonata No. 8 in C minor (called &quot;Grande sonate pathétique&quot; by his publisher).<br /><br />Now I'm not trying to demean anyone's work. I just don't want to see EMUya getting taken down by the record industry on the front page of Slashdot, with the highest-rated comments expressing a sentiment that &quot;He had it coming.&quot;
