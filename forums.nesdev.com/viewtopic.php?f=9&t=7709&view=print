		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />It sounds like you may have damaged the sprite hardware. Goonies II and SMB both use Sprite 0 (afaik) to do screen splits for their status bars. Given how that method of screen splitting usually requires the program to wait in a loop until the detection happens, it'd make sense that both games would hang.
<br />
<br />SMB3's lack of sprites just backs this up.
<br />
<br />Makes me wonder what, exactly, got damaged though, since there are a few reasons why sprites would fail.

<br />Quick question, maybe it's because I'm not as experienced with electronics as I'd like to be, but what is supposed to be accomplished when you put a capacitor between VCC and GND? That sounds like a good way to cause a short circuit and nothing else. o_O
<br />
<br />Second, when you say you switched the polarity, do you mean you put a directional capacitor on backwards?

<br />Wait, wouldn't the proper way to do that be to separate pin 21 (video out) from the board, stick the capacitor onto pin 21, and then connect the capacitor to the board?
<br />
<br />Like I said, connecting VCC to GND just makes a short.

<br />"Bouncing" refers to mechanical things, like switches and buttons. As in, when you press a button, it's not a clean transition from open to closed, but the button physically "bounces" against the circuit before it rests. Basically, you see something like:
<br />1-------0101010----------1010101------
<br />instead of:
<br />1---------0------------1--------
<br />for when a button is pressed (1-&gt;0) and released (0-&gt;1).
<br />
<br />The PPU doesn't deal with mechanical things like that when rendering video, and unless I'm misunderstanding the OP, he wants to filter the output of the video, which I think is better accomplished by fiddling with the video-out pin, instead of vcc/gnd. So am I right to be confused here? I see how it would be helpful to add a "debouncing" capacitor between vcc and gnd, but I'm having trouble seeing how it would be conductive to video output.
