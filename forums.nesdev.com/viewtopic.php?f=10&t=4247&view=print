		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />These days I'm experimenting with the samples Blarg was nice enough to provide in a different thread in the nesdev forum and I'm very grateful. 
<br />
<br />I'm cut/pasting code here and there, see what happens, make it fail to learn more etc.  All seems to be going well and now I have something showing on the screen.
<br />
<br />But now something is puzzling me.  The code bellow allow you to scroll the screen:
<br />
<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">; Waits for NMI then scrolls background to X,Y<br />; Preserved: X, Y<br />set_scroll:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;; Wait for next NMI. You should NOT use wait_vbl for timing,<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;; since it will occasionally wait TWICE as long, causing<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;; scrolling to be choppy &#40;try it and see&#41;.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;jsr wait_nmi<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />--&gt;; Enable background display<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;lda #%00001000<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;sta PPUMASK<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />--&gt;; PPUCTRL should be rewritten with last value<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;lda #PPUCTRL_NMI<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;sta PPUCTRL<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;; Set X and Y scroll position<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;stx PPUSCROLL<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;sty PPUSCROLL<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;rts<br /></div>
<br />
<br />Everything is fine except if I comment the "enable background display" and "PPUCTRL should be rewritten with last value", everything is still going fine in an emulator (I don't have any way to test it on the real hardware yet).
<br />
<br />My question is: why do you need these lines?  Are they just code that you need to use for it to work on the real thing?  I don't see why I would need to reactivate the Background/NNI flag every time unless I need to change how the background/NMI behave?

<br />
<br />My goal is to make a game that do scroll so any information related to these registers about scrolling will be greatly appreciated. 
<br />
<br />I knew that I was setting the others bits to 0, it just since I didn't know about the msb for scrolling, I didn't see the reason to update on every scroll the PPUCTRL register.  Once you know about that, then I see why you would want to set back the NMI + other flags + XY MSB every time on a scroll since  if you don't you will lose them.

<br />
<br />I agree with that.  My only concern is if the technical documents could be  wrong in the first place then it make it even harder to understand how to use it.
<br />
<br />For example, in my problem, I didn't understand why to update the PPU_CTRL during a scroll in blarg's tentative tutorial.  When I read the doc on the nes wiki (and nestech), this is what I found:
<br />
<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">76543210<br />||||||||<br />||||||++- Base nametable address<br />||||||&nbsp; &nbsp; &#40;0 = $2000; 1 = $2400; 2 = $2800; 3 = $2C00&#41;<br />|||||+--- VRAM address increment per CPU read/write of PPUDATA<br />|||||&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#40;0: increment by 1, going across; 1: increment by 32, going down&#41;<br />||||+---- Sprite pattern table address for 8x8 sprites &#40;0: $0000; 1: $1000&#41;<br />|||+----- Background pattern table address &#40;0: $0000; 1: $1000&#41;<br />||+------ Sprite size &#40;0: 8x8; 1: 8x16&#41;<br />|+------- PPU master/slave select &#40;has no effect on the NES&#41;<br />+-------- Generate an NMI at the start of the<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; vertical blanking interval &#40;0: off; 1: on&#41;<br /></div>
<br />
<br />nowhere is it written that bit 0 and 1 are for the MSB of the X and Y scroll location like Tepple mentioned above (which I'm grateful that he mentioned it).  Now, is it because the document is wrong or some information is missing?
<br />
<br />So, Tokumaru, what would you suggest to do for someone that do want to create a game?  What resource would be useful in that case?

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Yeah, they call those bits "Base nametable address", which isn't wrong. Just think about the width of a screen. It's 256 pixels wide, so The X scroll register (which is 8 bits wide) can address any of those pixels. Now, when there are 2 screens/nametables in a row, the total width is 512 pixels, which means you need 1 extra bit (for a total of 9) in order to address any pixel in that area. So, you can think of this bit as a "nametable selection bit" (because it indicates if the pixel you want is at the left side or at the right side), or as a 9th bit of the scroll value, for a total of 512 pixels.
<br />
<br />As a programmer of scrolling games, I like to think of those bits as the 9th bits of each scroll coordinate. Authors of non-scrolling games might be more comfortable referring to them as "nametable selection bits", because they just use them to pick 1 of 4 possible nametables at a time.
<br />
<br />About learning how to program games, that's kinda hard... I can't really suggest someone does what I did, because I started back in the DOS days, and that's just not practical at all these days. Maybe one of those Flash Game Programming books... I recently downloaded one about ActionScript 3 games that covered many of the basic principles of a game. And Flash is really great to just get things going quickly.
<br />
<br />Once you have the general idea of how a game works, you might see more clearly how all of that PPU and 6502 information can be put together to form something decent.

<br />
<br />Tokumaru, thanks for the information.  So you're changing the name table to be able to address more than 256 pixels (because of 8 bit limitation in away, this is how I can visualize it).  It make sense now. So when the X/Y overflow, I need to change the name table.
<br />
<br />When I meant about making games, I meant making game on the nes.  I did long time ago some very simple games in dos too when I was a kid, so making a game is not an issue. My issue is how to do it on the nes.  I don't think there is any documents about that.  
<br />
<br />I guess the more I will experiment, the more my project will shape up.
<br />
<br />edit: 
<br />Just a personal comment about flash, I have to work on a big project (not a game) in AS2 and what I can say is : hell.  The CS3 debugger is utter rubbish.  Maybe not related to this thread, just a way to vent my current frustration  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_lol.gif" alt=":lol:" title="Laughing" />

Just keep in mind that the nametables are 240 pixels tall, so Y overflows earlier. I prefer to use vertical mirroring, so that I don't have to care about the msb of the Y coordinate (although that breaks compatibility with 4-screen games).<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">My issue is how to do it on the nes.

I mentioned the Flash thing because many people who show up here do not know the basic structure of a game, and learning the hardware details of the NES is meaningless in those cases. Flash provides a quick way to experiment things, and one can get a basic game working in minutes. If you already made a few (even if very simple) game engines in the past, you probably don't need that kind of tutorial.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">I guess the more I will experiment, the more my project will shape up.</div>
<br />I guess. IMO, games have little to do with interacting with the hardware. I usually code a few routines that take care of that part right away, and all the heavy work is actually put on the game logic. So once you're past that, you can experiment with the actual game engine and see what works best for you.
<br />
<br />EDIT: About the CS3 comment, well, I code in AS3 (which BTW is much better than AS2) sometimes, but I don't use Flash, I compile my code with the free Flex SDK. This means that I have *zero* debugging capabilities (not even "trace" works), but it isn't so bad, since I'm used to 6502 asm! =)

I made some code to be able to do a an infinite map (like a world map in FF) and it was working well.  I just put the project on the ice because I don't have much interest in the DS these days.  I went back to my favorite platform, the nes, and I gave it a go.  No I hope to go somewhere.<br /><br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">About the CS3 comment, well, I code in AS3 (which BTW is much better than AS2) sometimes, but I don't use Flash, I compile my code with the free Flex SDK.

<br />
<br />I don't really use AS2 by choice, more because of a third party library which doesn't support AS3... Because of that technical limitation, we are stuck int AS2. And it's a one shot project which I had to learn all about the fun (...) of flash in very limited time.
<br />
<br />I hope that you use the free IDE flashDevelop, it really save you a lot of time.  It interface is very similar to visual studio.
<br />
<br />As for debugging, in your situation I would suggest you to create a debug panel that contains the information you want to trace. Worst case, if the space is limited, you can always send some data to another external flash object  or even sent it to the html page.

Each occupies a 1 KB chunk of PPU address space, starting at $2000 at the top left, $2400 at the top right, $2800 at the bottom left, and $2C00 at the bottom right.</div>
<br />But yes, it's a good idea to include both interpretations of bits 0 and 1. I've made this edit in the PPU article on the wiki; thanks for the idea. If you find something unclear, you can always register on the wiki and post in an article's talk page.
