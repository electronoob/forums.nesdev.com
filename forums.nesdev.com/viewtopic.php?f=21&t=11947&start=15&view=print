I've already made two programs that support a Super NES mouse through a Super NES controller to NES adapter: Thwaite and my sound effects editor. But right now, the only NES emulator I can think of that supports a mouse is Nintendulator, and Quietust refuses to add filters. So first you'd have to either A. solder together such an adapter to run on an actual NES, B. request support for an NTSC filter in an NES emulator that supports the Super NES Mouse, or C. request support for the Super NES Mouse in an NES emulator that supports an NTSC filter. I've <a href="http://sourceforge.net/p/fceultra/bugs/672/" class="postlink">requested support for the Super NES Mouse in FCEUX</a>.

Even changing the aspect ratio with interpolation back to 256 x 224 would still should the NTSC filter's effect pretty well.<br /><br />What you did was resize it to 256 x 224, but preserving the new aspect ratio with black bars, and apparently without interpolation, leaving us with an image that is very distorted vertically (especially look at all those stripe artifacts across the image). All I'm saying is that because of the resizing process you applied, the example you made didn't really show us what the NTSC filter does very well at all.<br /><br />Three examples of how it could have been done alternatively:<br /><br /><div class="attachtitle">Attachment:</div><div class="attachcontent">
			<span class="gensmall"><b>File comment:</b> Interpolated to 301 x 224. (Aspect preserved.)</span><br />

			<span class="gensmall">just_interpolated.png [ 140.37 KiB | Viewed 3252 times ]</span>
		

		<br />
	</div><br />Interpolated to 301 x 224. I think this is best; an interpolation of precisely 50% on both axes leaves a clean result, and preserves the aspect ratio.<br /><br /><div class="attachtitle">Attachment:</div><div class="attachcontent">
			<span class="gensmall"><b>File comment:</b> Interpolated to 256 x 191. (Aspect preserved, vertical information loss.)</span><br />

			<span class="gensmall">letterboxed.png [ 118.52 KiB | Viewed 3252 times ]</span>
		

		<br />
	</div><br />Interpolated to 256 x 191. Unlike the example you made, the interpolation method used here preserves some of the detail. There is still significant information loss vertically, so this is not entirely clean, but at least you have less artifacts.<br /><br /><div class="attachtitle">Attachment:</div><div class="attachcontent">
			<span class="gensmall"><b>File comment:</b> Interpolated to 256 x 224. (Horizontal squish.)</span><br />

		<br />
	</div><br />Interpolated to 256 x 224. This shows fairly well what the NTSC filter does, but ignores the aspect ratio change. There is some loss of detail about what the NTSC filter does horizontally, but it is not as prone to aliasing problems as the vertical loss of detail is, since the NTSC signal is organized in scanlines.<br /><br />Specifically Lanczos interpolation was used, but other interpolation methods may give similar results. The main thing here is not to use nearest neighbour resampling (no interpolation) when scaling down.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Fair warning: the reason that nes_ntsc produces an image that's stretched horizontally is because <em>the actual hardware does that</em>. Undoing the aspect ratio change is somewhat misleading ... either you have the NTSC artifacts, and the pixel aspect ratio is 8:7, or you use square pixels and there's no NTSC artifacts.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Not to mention: I don't know what all of this is being used for -- the thread so far implies it's being used for map generation -- but when it comes to screenshots, it's my experience that people really don't like seeing blurry crap and would rather see sharp pixels.<br /><br />I can't tell you how many times I've used GameFAQs maps and so on, only to find people applied stupid filters + weird resizing + other crap and the end result actually hurts my eyes.  I actually go find other maps/walkthroughs/etc. in that scenario.  So IMO you're better off not bothering and instead just doing a linear (&quot;nearest neighbour&quot;) scale of 2x and so on.<br /><br />If you're doing it for some other reason, i.e. you wanna see if the graphics improvements/changes you're doing would look semi-good with actual NTSC artefacting, then that's a bit more understandable.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Well, the reason I was originally interested in this is because I needed to test my sprites for clarity. In the past, I've had a lot of people complain that my sprites don't have enough contrast or they're too detailed even if I think they're fine. So as a good benchmark, I like to view them with an NTSC filter to see if I can still recognize them. If I can't, I usually go back and change body proportions, remove details, etc.<br /><br />Anyways, regardless of the aspect ratio, this NTSC filter works great for my purposes! Thanks again for compiling this for the less programming-adept such as I.

I mean, artifacts vary at the subpixel level, so the higher resolution is actually needed for an accurate representation. Not to mention that let's face it, it's not a large image for today's resolutions (heck, for the current higher resolutions 256×224 is actually too small).

For example:<br /><br />- Linear interpolation is done on audio.<br />- Bilinear interpolation is done on images.<br />- Trilinear interpolation is done on a volume, often a stack of images like in mip-mapping.<br /><br />The prefix may be omitted if the number of dimensions is implictly known, or otherwise unimportant.<br /><br />Unfortunately this scheme of prefixes does not hold up consistently in other cases. For instance the terms &quot;biquadratic filter&quot; and &quot;binormal&quot; don't refer to 2-dimensional analogs of a &quot;quadratic filter&quot; or &quot;normal&quot;.

Trilinear means doing that and also linear interpolation between mipmaps (a third &quot;axis&quot;), although I suppose it also applies to the Z axis when it comes to 3D textures.<br /><br />Simple linear interpolation would be interpolating in one axis and not the others =P I'm not even sure if that's supported by the hardware (OpenGL doesn't support it).
