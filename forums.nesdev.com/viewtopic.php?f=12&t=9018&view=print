		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I've been wondering how I could add a backup battery to my Game Doctor, since its RAM is wiped every time you unplug the device. In this thread (<!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.famicomworld.com/forum/index.php?topic=7955.0">http://www.famicomworld.com/forum/index ... pic=7955.0</a><!-- m -->) we've already established that the GD uses DRAM, which will need to be replaced with SRAM. I come to you guys for a little extra technical advice on how to do so. Thanks!

<br />
<br />Insert it and the DRAM &amp; SRAM is retained... That's actually the GD's most famous selling point!
<br />
<br />Or get a 9V battery pack if for some reason you require it to be battery backed. Get a big one because it must keep the oscillator, ASIC and DRAM powered, a rather large current draw.
<br />
<br />---
<br />
<br />The idea to replace the DRAM with 32M of SRAM is ridiculous, the RAM will cost more than a GDSFIII is worth and honestly doesn't make any sense. Don't waste your money or capable parts building this.
<br />
<br />If you are just curious about adapting DRAM to SRAM in your design I don't understand why you need two CR2032s. LP SRAM as typical in battery backup applications retains state at well under 3V since their point is to be powered by a 3V battery and holdout to the knee voltage. Also using a linear regulator in a battery circuit is a quick way to drain your battery. Diodes are only needed if you're going to do an OR-wired supply where current is diverted from the battery to the console's rail when active. In that case just put a 1K resistor in series with the battery, use fast switching diodes and decouple VDD well.
<br />
<br />As for the logic, you don't need "demultiplexers" (usually referred to as decoders) to demultiplex the address bus*, you would need negative-edge-triggered registers to hold row and column address bits for the SRAM. Latches as mentioned will not work since in DRAM systems /RAS is asserted *through* the /CAS strobe and thus the row latch will be corrupted by the column address.
<br />
<br />*you would need a '138 or similar because you must decode the most significant address lines to select your 4M or 16M chips
