		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Mega Man 9 looks like a(n advanced) NES game, sounds like a NES game and plays like a NES game.  But would it be possible to create such a game on a stock NES?
<br />
<br />The emulator Capcom used to create MM9 was supposed to emulate NES hardware and the programmers were to adhere to those limitations.  However, having partially completed the game, I wonder how closely they did so.  More importantly, if it could run in a real NES, it should.  
<br />
<br />In this article, Hironobu Takeshita, the producer of the game, says that the game could not fit in a Famicom cartridge because it is too large.
<br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/3752/he_is_8bit_capcoms_hironobu_.php">http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/3 ... onobu_.php</a><!-- m -->
<br />
<br />However, I wonder if it were reprogrammed, I think it could probably fit within a large NES cartridge.  Mega Man 4-6 on the NES used 512KB and had more stages than this game.  MMC3 can support 768KB.  MMC5 can support 2 Megabytes!  Graphics during those cutscenes would obviously need to be compressed.  
<br />
<br />In terms of removing features, the online capabilities would have to be removed.  The challenges may also have to go if they take up too much space or slow the processor down (because there is alot to track!)
<br />
<br />The sound and control should be fine.  The chief problem is the graphics, given the NES's color and sprite limitations.  Undoubtedly there will be more flicker in a NES port than in the Wii version.  I cannot tell whether they are breaking the background tile limitations (too many colors, too many unique tiles) or the sprite limitations (more than 8 per line/64 per screen).  Finally, if there is too much going on in a particular screen, would the game increase speed to avoid slowdown whereas the NES would be stuck with 1.79MHz?
<br />
<br />The cartridge would also need some S-RAM to handle the save function within the game.  However, the NES and Gameboy games used a password system that would probably work well enough to encompass the shop items (but not the challenges!)  Perhaps to save space and manufacturing costs a password system would work better.

The only true limitation are the palettes, mappers can open up anything else you'd want though it'd be a little silly for them to approach the complexity of the CPU and PPU. <br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">Great Hierophant wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">The emulator Capcom used to create MM9 was supposed to emulate NES hardware and the programmers were to adhere to those limitations.

<br />Are you SURE it's emulated? I have read somewhere that it's not, it's just an original game which strives to look "8-bit" for gamers on the retro bandwagon.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />It seems reasonable that they would write a graphics engine that had limitations similar to the NES in terms of what's displayed. I imagine everything besides the graphics and sound you get out is done very differently than a NES game, in a a high-level language (C++ most likely), using gobs of memory and many megabytes of object code. All that would have to be reimplemented on the NES&gt;

<br />Considering the background is completely empty and black at the area of those platforms, I think it could be done on the NES with crafty CHR-RAM and nametable writes, since some tiles repeat in the platforms.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I was extremely impressed by the "feel" of the game.  The gameplay is as fluid as the NES games and the timing is spot on.  I would suggest that would be difficult to recreate using a different programming language and a processor running several orders of magnitude faster than a NES 2A03.  This suggests they did not start from scratch here and may have emulated the gameplay itself using a limited CPU emulator.

Since all modern consoles still render frames at 60Hz, and can sync code to each frame, there's no reason they couldn't perform the same animation and physics algorithms as the original games without a unnecessary emulator in the mix.
<br />
<br />I bet all graphics are stored as bitmaps and audio as PCM (composed with a power tracker) like that Rockman 7 FC thing.

<br />This is the popular way to say "the graphics of MM9 doesn't fully respect the NES' true limitations so it can't be done on the NES".
<br />
<br />The MMC5 can do 8x8 color area tiles and more than 256 tiles on both BG and sprites, so that may help a little.
<br />Soneone would have to reverse engineer MM9 and scale it down to make a true NES game from it.

<br />Except the new programmers might misunderstand the classic games' physics when trying to reimplement it from a disassembly of the old game. Look at the defect in the brick-breaking physics of SMB1 in Super Mario All-Stars.

<br />If professional programmers uses disasemblies from their own old games then they really suck. They should keep archives for both informatical and paper copies of their old sources code internally.
<br />I guess the SMB1 changes probably were done on purpose. If Nintendo lost the sources in 1994 of a game they made in 1985 and that was their most sucessful, then they really, really suck.
