		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I was just trying out DMC samples, but I'm a little confused on how they exactly work. The $4011 degister is the most confusing one, since some documents call it DMC Load, some call it DMC Raw and some call it DAC. Which one is correct and what is it actually used for? Next thing is that I don't know which one of the DMC registers activate the sample playback when you write to them. The last things are the sample address and length. How can you load a 16 bit sample address with a 8 bit value? Do I write it twice like in PPUScroll? An what if sample lenth is longer than what 8 bit values can handle?  Do I have to play it as two individual samples or is there a way around this?

In the wiki documents, be aware that % is sometimes used to prefix binary digits, like $ is used to prefix hexadecimal digits. And the . seems to just mark a byte boundary. Then you can see the % code is showing you how the bits you put in the register affect the resulting address and length values used.<br /><br /><strong>$4011 register</strong><br /><div class="quotetitle">Tsutarja wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">The $4011 degister is the most confusing one, since some documents call it DMC Load, some call it DMC Raw and some call it DAC.

When an official Nintendo document was found, the <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/viewtopic.php?f=2&amp;t=10611#p119814" class="postlink">official APU register names</a> were rather undescriptive, so it's unlikely anyone would use the official name.)</span><br /><br />Here are some things this &quot;direct load&quot; register is used for:<br /><br /><ul><strong>Changing the starting level of a sample</strong><br /><br />As you may know, the sample format only lets you specify each point as &quot;go up&quot; or &quot;go down&quot;, not at exact value. As the sample is played, if the level is too low to go down further, or too high to go up further, it will stay where it is. By using different starting levels before playing the sample, you might be able to get different variations of sound from the same sample.<br /><br />In Ikinari Musician, a sample with a general downward trend is used. When the starting level is set to higher values, this causes the sample to be audible slightly longer before it bottoms out and effectively becomes silent. Using the different starting levels produces different variations of a click sound from the same sample.<br /><br /><div class="attachtitle">Attachment:</div><div class="attachcontent">

Because this requires intensive use of the CPU, when used in games all other gameplay is usually halted to facilitate this.&quot;<br /><br />That is, if you are able to load the &quot;direct load&quot; register at a fast enough rate, you can make sounds beyond the restrictions of the &quot;go up&quot; / &quot;go down&quot; sample format. You are in charge of the exact value of each point, but you have to spend a lot of time updating the register.<br /><br />Battletoads uses direct DMC loading for some percussion sounds. TMNTDEMO.NES plays the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles cartoon theme song using direct DMC loading. <span style="font-size: 85%; line-height: normal">(In FCEUX, use SoundDisplay.lua and you can see the &quot;DMC Seed&quot; changing, but the note line doesn't flash because a sample is never started.)</span><br /><br /><strong>Triangle volume control (partial)</strong><br /><br /><a href="http://wiki.nesdev.com/w/index.php/APU#DMC_.28.244010-4013.29" class="postlink">APU</a> says &quot;Because of the APU's <a href="http://wiki.nesdev.com/w/index.php/APU#Mixer" class="postlink">nonlinear</a> mixing, a high value in the PCM counter reduces the volume of the triangle and noise channels. This is sometimes used to apply limited volume control to the triangle channel (e.g. Super Mario Bros. adjusts the counter between levels to accomplish this).&quot;</ul>

Is this just for the game to keep track that the sample has started, or is it used somehow else?<br /><br />Lastly, how should I make the DMC tracks for the music? Should I have a counter that counts down from specified value and then once it hits 0, it will play the next sample? Also, should I start the counter from DMC trigger or end?

The sample address and length ($4012 and $4013) apply at the next sample start or loop.<br /><br />To play a new sample, you use $4015. Typically you want to write to $4015 with the DMC bit clear first to stop any playing sample, then write a second time with the bit set to start the new sample.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">Tsutarja wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">I remember seeing a RAM address in RECCA that quickly changes to 1 and then back to 0 when DMC is triggered.

Also, should I start the counter from DMC trigger or end?</div><br />The DMC maintains its own counter. You can read $4015 to check if the DMC bit is still on to see if the sample has finished. Are you trying to play a long stream of continuous sound through it? If you just want to stitch samples end to end, you might use the IRQ feature, possibly in combination with the looping state.
