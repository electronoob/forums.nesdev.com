<br />
<br />Something tells me the Nintendo engineers were a bit smarter than this. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":-)" title="Smile" />  The reason is because they are trying to maximize linearity of their "DACs".   The DACs are made via a very cute little process-  to make the DAC, there are various transistors of different sizes.  Larger area transistor = lower resistance, smaller area = higher resistance.
<br />
<br />Sooo what they do for say a 4 bit dac is they have 4 transistors- bit 0 has an area of A.  bit 1 has an area of 2A, on up to bit 3 which is 8A.  This forms a pretty effective DAC, and is cheap to make.
<br />
<br />These transistors and the 100 ohm resistor form a voltage divider network.  By keeping the voltage variation at the audio pin fairly low (using the low resistance), the linearity will be better.   Otherwise, the DAC outputs would be highly nonlinear and "squashed up" near the end.
<br />
<br />Audio's pretty low level generally anyways so this isn't that much of an impediment.  The inverter that Nintendo used amplifies the signals though a tad, and provides some filtering, which matches it to the amplifier in the modulator.  The end result is a nice 1V p-p (approx) audio signal out of the AUDIO OUT jack.
<br />
<br />Just for fun, let's calculate how much heat this will generate.  I get around 250ish ohms for the two squares and I assume the other channel is similar.  So with 250 ohms and the 100 ohm in series, that's 350 ohms.  Halving this (since there's two channels) nets us 175 ohms.  5V across 175 ohms gives us 28ma, and multiplying out means we're going to be burning up .14 watts.  This is a worst case scenario on top of it all.
<br />
<br />140mw isn't alot of heat- the power LED on the nintendo is going to be using about this much power, hehe.   
<br />
<br />No, the heat is caused by the NMOS process technology used in the chip's fabrication. Not the audio DACs.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Oh, I didn't get all of this, but I mostly understand the audio signal is very small anyway, so low noise/linearity error is prior to power stuff.
<br />And yes, the CPU of the NES is somewhat heating, but I just trought they wouldn't want to heat things even more with this even if this is only a little. Well, in fact the 100 ohms resistors are external, but are still a part of the DAC itself, right (I guess there is internal R2R arrays) and that the final resistor is external ? Without them the output would budge, right ?
