I don't see what's wrong with <em>that</em>.<br /><br />My disgust with porn-shaming behaviour, comes from the fact that good artists have left, or worse,<br />hurt themselves from assholes bullying them about their trade.<br /><br />Hearing &quot;waste of talent&quot;, or &quot;you're a loser&quot; gets to people over time.<br /><br /><br /><br />@Tepples<br />A much better option to KickStarter, though it's been abused just as much, if not more--<br />To be honest? Patreon. I still hate crowd-funding, but this one has dynamic payment, to mitigate scamming.<br /><br />The content creator wastes funds, or stops producing content? Cut the funding, and move on. Simple.<br />As far as KickStarter is concerned, scamming IS the standard.<br /><br /><br /><br />@Dougeff<br />If it wasn't obvious from the &quot;oops&quot; in my cancellation post, the image removal was<br />not intentional. I just nuked out my Imgur account, to get my art off of NintendoAge.<br /><br />I have the image uploads archived, so I could edit my posts to re-upload them.<br /><br /><br /><br />@Nameguy<br />I'm sorry about the cancellation, but if I'm making a game for a community like <em>that</em>, it's not worth the stress. A series of rude e-mails in my inbox, was the final nail in the coffin to making games.<br /><br />Being honest, and telling you, is better than wasting any more of your time with this.<br /><br />I haven't thrown the game in the trash, I threw it on Google Drive, so I don't have to look at it, anymore.<br /><br />I may revisit Cat Quest in the future, but that day is far off. If at all.<br /><br /><br /><br />@Kasumi<br />Oh, please don't give out my Twitter! I'd rather people just forget about me, and my work.<br /><br />Yeah, the CHR files are all still there. The image removal was an accident on my part.<br />Who said I removed my online gallery?! It's still over here (NSFW warning):<br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.furaffinity.net/user/icelink256/">http://www.furaffinity.net/user/icelink256/</a><!-- m --><br /><br />I did delete my personal portfolio, however. For reasons listed below.<br /><br /><br /><br />CollectorVision offered to help me finish Cat Quest, but that wasn't the problem. I declined the offer.<br />After completing some sprite work for him, I will be quitting game design altogether.<br /><br />As a sign of good faith, I will be GIVING him Anna Fuda: Project Eden, including the script, art and characters.<br /><br />Here's to my first (and only!) year of making games for the Western market. Amazing.<br />(To compare, I made games for the Asian market, for 15 years, with minimal issues.)<br /><br />But who cares what I think? I'm just a &quot;mentally unstable&quot; rich brat, who draws breasts for cash.<br />Their words (Nintendo Age), not mine.

NesDev is not a representative audience either, but it's a completely different cross section of Nintendo enthusiasts (who definitely do largely prefer software, especially free software, over tangible things). This is my point, though, each of these communities is only a small slice of a much bigger hobby. Like minded people collect at these places, you're not getting a good survey from it.

The original comment which set him off over on NA was actually a compliment---saying his game was good enough to be a high-profile kickstarter project. Instead of saying something like: &quot;well, I'm not really into kickstarter, but I assume you meant you think my game is good!&quot; he acted kind of immature. People first called him out on this, and not in an unkind fashion. It began to unravel from there. It all could have been prevented. The guy's talented, but is also massively immature to match that talent, unfortunately. I hope he changes his mind at some point in the future. <sub>as long as he doesn&#39;t put any penises in Cat Quest</sub>
