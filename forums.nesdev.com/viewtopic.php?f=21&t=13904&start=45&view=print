		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />This is great what you did, I would love it to be a reality to play it, on the other hand although it is somewhat complex to bring the game to reality if it is able to display all the graphics you want, the Somari Engine uses a pirate variant of mmc3 , this makes it possible to move a large graphical load without flinching, but in this case it should be used in the background to avoid multiple overlapping, something similar can be seen in the Final Zone, another problem that you will have to deal with is the reduced space you have for the tileset (128x128), because although the game is able to change it dynamically this must be set in the programming of each type of object (I'm not 100% sure of that), but in case you do not want To complicate yourself so much by adapting existing resources you can create something decent enough.<br />Â <br />Commenting a little more about the benefits of this Engine, all objects are made up of blocks of 16x16 to which you can easily assign any palette or existing physics, in the same way enemies can be called at any level, but they will be the graphs of the objset assigned to the level, although this is easily modifiable, finally the levels are conformed by approximately 63 blocks of 256x240 per Zone, excepting the special stage and the final Zone, these can be called indefinitely at the level of the level (Objects use another table to be loaded). If you are interested in all these things I will explain them in more detail in this <a href="http://www.romhacking.net/forum/index.php?topic=26336.20" class="postlink">post</a> <img src="./images/smilies/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt=":mrgreen:" title="Mr. Green" />.<br /><br /> I also pass this application always helps me to adapt graphics <a href="http://x128.ho.ua/color-quantizer.html" class="postlink">Color Quantizer</a> (sometimes it is advisable to load your own palette instead of using the one that calculates the application).<br /><br /> Luck!  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=":wink:" title="Wink" />

It's not quite as disruptive as creating a duplicate topic just to add a reply, and it shows that a user is at least using the search button. See &quot;Posting and You&quot; (<a href="http://www.albinoblacksheep.com/flash/posting" class="postlink">SWF</a> or <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gx4EfoLzu_I" class="postlink">YouTube</a>).
