<br />
<br />Well, it is documented to emulate the cart and to know how it is composed BUT it does not explain the hardware stuff.
<br />In fact, it is "easy" to read a MMC chip but it is hard to know how to change register and bank. As THIS is documented for all xNROM, it is not for MMC.
<br />
<br />However, we succeeded in understanding how the MMC1B2 works (at least this one, not tested with other revision but it should work fine too, on MMC1x) ! We manage access to the CHR, PRG and the damn timer.

<br />
<br />Maybe, we did not try MMC3 for now.
<br />For the MMC1, there is also the timer sent by the NES CPU which makes it harder : you have to read/write and select on which bank you need to go in a certain manner. In fact, the read/write is buffered somewhere ONLY on the ascending movement from the timer. That is the difficulty.
<br />
<br />The thing you have to understand is that Spaghetto do not come onto the NES like CopyNES does, it "talks" with the cartridge so we have to learn how to speak with the cart. We know how to read a cart, we know how to change bank but it is how the switch is handled we don't know (at least for MMC1 we do know now).

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Timer ? What are you talking about ? You mean buffer, I presume ? Yeah, MMC1 writes are buffered, so you have to reset the chip by writing something with bit 7 to 1 logic state to it, then it's buffering will be reseted.
<br />Then, each 5 writes, the buffer will be full of 5 logic states, and 5-bit data will be sent to the corresponding MMC1 register (in function of the last write only), and at this point the MMC1 buffer is automatically reseted, so the next write (the sixth one) will begin a new value again, and again, etc...
<br />Maybe spagettho 2 doesn't hold MMC1 reset signals correcly ?
<br />
<br />You don't know how the switch is handled.... you mean how the MMC1 bankswitches banks ? It toggles the A14-A17 lines automatically for PRG, and CHR banking is a bit more complex, I think you should setup the MMC1 in 8kb CHR banking mode, and dump only odd numbered banks. I have no knowledge about how works a dumping machine, but I can imagine it pretty much. The output lines will swap only after the 5th write... I really can't see much what is your problem, tough...

<br />Yep, that is just what we found this week-end.
