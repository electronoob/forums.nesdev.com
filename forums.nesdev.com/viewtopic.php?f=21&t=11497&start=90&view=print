The only thing the SMS has over the NES is color depth, so some graphics would have to be simplified so that they can work and not flicker too bad.  The SMS game flickers a LOT as it is.</div><br /><br />I was thinking about using the SMS version as a basis for the sprites. But I don't think I will do any more work on R-Type, it was really tedious to do that mockup and I feel it needs a bit more color to really shine which is not really possible on the NES, unfortunately.

As much as I like Shantae, I'm not sure GBC to NES conversions make sense, from an artistic point of view. My point is that there isn't much reimagining involved, it's mostly color reduction. Still, if anyone can come up with an interesting mock-up for Shantae, I'd like to see it.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Not to mention the game takes advantage of sprite layering to the extreme (it's because of that why there's next to nothing going on at any given time, GBC STILL has a sprites per line limitation) and probably has more than 8 palettes in use at a time.  I think the GBC could do 50 or so colors at a given time?

	<tr>
		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I think only Shantae herself uses layering (this gets really obnoxious with enemies that use the yellow/red/black palette).<br /><br />As for palettes, if I recall correctly the GBC has more palettes than the NES does, so that's a downside too. I don't recall any palette raster effects (i.e. all palette tricks would be screen-wide), but it does rewrite tiles on the fly (e.g. brick parallax in some underground levels), so that has to be taken into account too. Also the palette in the background plane can be set per-tile, right?<br /><br />Also: the GBC resolution is smaller. This means that a sprite of the same pixel size covers a larger portion of the screen, and Shantae is designed around those sizes (meaning everything would look too small on a NES).

But as someone else mentioned, take that in relation to the screen size as well (ratio wise, they're bigger sprites than the NES).
