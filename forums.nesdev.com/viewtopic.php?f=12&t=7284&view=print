		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Hi all, I'm new to the forum and pretty new to programming on the snes.  I just had a quick question I'm having a tough time solving despite raking through the docs online plenty of times.
<br />
<br /> In Mode 0 with 2-bit color, I don't really understand why for BG2 the starting color in CGRAM is "32"... though really I guess it'd be "33" as the transparency from color "0" should be carried to color 32 (err right?).  I understand not all BG1/2/3/4 will share the 4-color pallete starting at color 0 because each BG can have unique 4-color schemes, but why does BG2 start at 32 and not 5?
<br />
<br />Hopefully I make some sense, thanks to anyone who can help me!

<br />
<br />Each 16-bit word that you store in a BG map to specify which tile to draw at the corresponding screen location also contains 3 bits (d12:d10) for specifying which palette to use.
<br />
<br />If you have a BG that uses 2 bpp tiles, then each palette as seen by that BG is 4 colors. So if a tile on that BG has the palette index set to 6 then it will use colors 24..27 in the palette (24 = 6*4). On a 4 bpp BG a tile with pallete index 6 would use colors 96..111.

<br />Does each subpalette have its own backdrop color (e.g. 24 or 96) like on Game Boy Color, or do they all share one like on NES and Game Boy Advance?

<br />Thanks for the response, I know the three bits (ppp) you are referring to for palette selection.  I have found however that my BG1 and BG2 map data, even if they both use palette 0 (ppp=000) I have to rewrite the palette low/high color bytes at colors 32 onwards in CGRAM for BG2 to show properly. (Even though BG2 has been written to $2118 with ppp set to 0.... is this odd?).
<br />
<br />I have some sample code I've been working with if this sounds fishy.
<br />
<br />Thanks!

<br />
<br /> Not really odd at all. Each BG layer is assigned to a different section of the CRAM, that way it's optimized for color usage. And Tile pixel color #0 should always be transparent regardless of the layer or the value in CRAM for it (think of BG color #0 as its own layer).

<br />
<br />Huh, what do you mean by layers being assigned sections of CRAM?
<br />
<br />Different tiles on the same BG can use different subpalettes. And tiles on different BGs can use the same subpalettes, or subpalettes that overlap in the case of different bitcounts.

<br />
<br />My assumption is that you have a bug somehwere in there.
<br />It is of course perfectly possible to assign palette entries 0 onwards to any background.
<br />VSNES, a savestate viewer, comes in pretty handy when figuring out display-related problems.
<br />Bsnes also has a VRAM and palette viewer in its debugger.

<br />As I understand it, the four layers of mode 0 (but not other modes) use separate subpalettes in entries 0-31, 32-63, 64-95, and 96-127.

<br />I did too, I should have read further down the snippet from the doc you pasted (read it before, but not close enough).
<br />
<br />Anyways thanks everyone, good to have confirmation on this stuff  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" />
