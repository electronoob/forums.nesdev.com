		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Since buying the powerpak I have been trying to get it to work with a rgb modded nes.
<br />At the beginning I had very limited responses from the creator of the powerpak.
<br />After trying a few more emails I have never gotten a response.
<br />I don't know if there are some technical problems with his inbox or he is just choosing not to reply. 
<br />
<br />What ever that problem is I wish to get this working on my rgb nes with or with out him.
<br />
<br />I have made a few post on other forums and have had some suggestion made to me.
<br />
<br /><a href="http://www.tototek.com/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?t=1576&amp;postdays=0&amp;postorder=asc&amp;start=15" class="postlink">http://www.tototek.com/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?t=1576&amp;postdays=0&amp;postorder=asc&amp;start=15</a>
<br />
<br />Here is a picture on how the games look. this is space harrier
<br /><img src="http://www.greatlakesvista.com/mods/powerpak_rgb_nes.JPG" alt="Image" />
<br />
<br />Here are some videos I made
<br />I have tested super Mario running on the powerpak and the original cart with a variable cap from pin 24 on the gpu to gnd in my rgb nes. 
<br /><img src="http://i16.photobucket.com/albums/b14/moosmann/electronic/NEW-RPG-Amplifier.jpg" alt="Image" />
<br />I have included a wmv of each with real time video and sound as I adjust the cap. 
<br />If I use any cap the image the original games gets corrupt. I its kind of cool to see the effect as I slowly adjust the value. 
<br />If I use the cap on the powerpak Mario will start to run but with corrupt gfx. (this is making some progress since Mario would not run at before)
<br />this is kind of cool to watch.

<br /><a href="http://www.greatlakesvista.com/rgb/nes/mario_rgb_powerpak.wmv" class="postlink">http://www.greatlakesvista.com/rgb/nes/mario_rgb_powerpak.wmv</a>
<br />
<br />Since this did not fix the problem completely I plan to make a pass though 
<br />cart with the recommended resistants in line with the data lines.
<br />
<br />My plan is to remove all the components from a game genie and use it as a pass through. Then solder the 200 ohm pots on to the game genie. 
<br />
<br />I do not feel like messing with/messing up the powerpak its self.
<br />
<br />If any one has info on this that would be great.

<br />It does nothing I can notice. Even When I set the pots all the way to 200ohms
<br />I have tested in both a RGB and stock nes with the power pak and a retail cart.

The NES isn't receiving info correctly after the RGB mod is done.  I know it doesn't make a lot of sense, since all other carts work fine, but I figured I'd put that out there.  
<br />
<br />Acem, have you tried this on any clones?  You may want to try it on several if you have access to any.  I know the Powerpak doesn't "officially" work with clones, but some have said certain games are more compatible, strangely enough.
<br />
<br />Alternately, do you think the artifacts may be due to the RGB mod circuit or amp?  Do you get sound correctly even with the artfcats?  If so, can you confirm the game is running properly behind the scenes other than garbled graphics?
<br />
<br />Other than modding a Powerpack to work on a Vs. (yeah, right) or PC10 system, I'm not sure how else you could troubleshoot it.

<br />
<br />Maybe the amp is putting an odd load on the nes ppu that just effects the powerpak. Ill try it with out the rgb amp. good thing I made it plug and play.
<br />
<br />my friend does have a nes clone ill ask to borrow it.
<br />
<br />pc10 test will most likely never happy <img src="./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" />
<br />
<br />Here is some new info, tsenzen has a rgb famicom that does work with the power pak.

<br />
<br />I tried with out the amp same thing just much darker.
<br />I think its a good thing its not that the problem.  it would suck to play the power pak with very dark colors.  It would almost be as bad as the original problem.
<br />
<br />What are the pin numbers that needed the resistors in the 1st revs of the powerpak?
<br /> The pin numbers in the game genie my not be the same order? If thats the case my pots maybe in the wrong places.

<br />The nes that works with the powerpak has a mother board rev nes-cpu-4 and its serial is around 1,280,000.
<br />
<br />My nes that does not work has a mother board rev nes-cpu-7 and its serial is

<br />
<br />does any one have the real details on how nes serials tie in with the rev of nes mother boards

<br />i just bought a nes that was on ebay.
<br />Its serial is N1,394,910 and it has a Ver 4 Mother board.
<br />The guy was nice enough to take it a part and take pics for me.
<br />
<br />i am now looking into a way to make the nes have both ppus on a switch.
<br />i am thinking about using pull-down resistors.
<br />
<br />I have used something like this to have 2 switchable bioses in my neo-geo aes system and 2 switchable firmwares in my xbox 360 dvd rom.
<br /> 
<br />Does any one have any idea on the limits the nes ppu may have when trying this?

<br />
<br />I just got my new nes with the v4 Motherboard...  it has the same problem with the powerpak 
<br />as my v7 MB nes.
<br />
<br />I was up till 3am all happy thinking it was going to work with the powerpak just like the last nes i modded with the v4 MB.
<br />
<br />I did take high rez pics of the v4 nes that does work with the powerpak.
<br />
<br />The main difference I see is in the daughter board with the av,rf and power connections.
<br />There are some small brand name changes for some components.
<br />
<br />This v4 nes is the 1st nes I did the does need the cap from pin 24 on the ppu to gnd.
<br />
<br />
<br />Things I have tried to do when i had the v4 nes that did work with the powerpak.
<br />
<br />Switched rgb ppus, cart slots, removed the rgb amp, used the the cap on on pin 24 to gnd.

<br />
<br />The biggest differences I found are the use of 74LSXXX and 74HCXXX ICs
<br />And the missing 4Mhz CIC. Not really sure what the part is called? Ceramic Resonator?
<br />I am leaning toward the 74XXXXX ICs.

<br />The NES that does not work with the powerpak when rgb modded.
<br />nes-cpu-04
<br />SN#  N1394910
<br />
<br />Different part numbers
<br />U3  HD74LS139P
<br />U2  HD74LS373P
<br />
<br />this system is also missing a few components.
<br />C11 .01u Ceramic Cap (near the blue power connector)
<br />C12 .01u Ceramic Cap (near the blue power connector)
<br />4Mhz Out CIC (circuitry/lockout chip clock line). runs to pin 71 on the cart.  It has 2 empty holes. (near the 3193a lockout chip)
<br />
<br />Any other newer nes-cpu-07 Nintendos I looked at have a 3pin(one pin to gnd) light blue 4Mhz cic on them.
<br />
<br />---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<br /><img src="http://www.greatlakesvista.com/rgb/nes/V4_nes_Working.jpg" alt="Image" />
<br />
<br />
<br />The NES that does work with the powerpak when rgb modded.
<br />nes-cpu-04
<br />SN#  N1284385
<br />
<br />Different part numbers
<br />U3  TC74HC139P
<br />U2  TC74HC373P
<br />This nes 4Mhz looks like a Ceramic Resonator. It is red/orange in color.
<br />I would guess it uses 2 pins. I mailed the nintendo back and can not verify that any more.
<br />but the v4 nes I have now only has 2 holes on the pc
<br />-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<br />
<br />There is a difference between the power/RF/AV daughter board.
<br />There are only 5 pins going to that. 2 for power, 1 gnd, 1 composite video and 1 mono audio.
<br />I have a hard time believing that will effect the ppu or the powerpaks graphic abilities.
<br />
<br />Both nintendos have 74LSXXX silk screened on the pcb by U2 and U3.
<br />The working nes uses 74HCXXX ICs even though the silk screen calls for the the other 74LSXXX.
<br />
<br />while looking for info on 74 ICs I found this on a site.
<br />The 74LS (Low-power Schottky) family (like the original) uses TTL (Transistor-Transistor Logic) circuitry which is fast but requires more power than later families. The 74 series is often still called the 'TTL series' even though the latest ICs do not use TTL! 
<br />
<br />The 74HC family has High-speed CMOS circuitry, combining the speed of TTL with the very low power consumption of the 4000 series. They are CMOS ICs with the same pin arrangements as the older 74LS family. Note that 74HC inputs cannot be reliably driven by 74LS outputs because the voltage ranges used for logic 0 are not quite compatible, use 74HCT instead. 
<br />
<br />It sounds like the all nintendos really should only use 74LSXXX ICs. But I have saw one with 74LSXXX ICs.
<br />
<br />Does any one have any feed back on this.  Expecially the 4Mhz part and 74XXXXX ICs.
