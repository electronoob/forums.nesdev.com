I doubt that you will find anyone wanting to do this project for you for free as that is a LOT of time invested into making such a game. Plus, what would they get out of it. <br /><br />You would need to pay a hefty chunk of change for something like even one world.<br /><br />Think of it as a business deal, would you really expect anyone to just give you something such as a brand new Xbox One game from Best Buy? <br /><br />If you want it so bad, why not just <span style="text-decoration: underline">LEARN</span> ASM and do it yourself? This option has twofold benefits:<br />1) It saves you money.<br />2) It saves other people time.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">Savvy wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"><br />I also posted this in general-just wanted to cover all my bases.<br /></div><br />You posted the same thread twice?

If you were unsure, you should have asked the mods where this should have went.<br /><br />EDIT: For example, a hack like my SMB1/SMB2J with SRAM, glitch fixes (I fixed every glitch known to man), code optimization etc. would cost roughly $950 USD for someone wanting my ASM skills. And that's for a hack alone. (I did it for free because it's something I wanted to do for <em>me</em>.)<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=5262">ShaneM</a> — Sat Sep 20, 2014 8:11 am</p><hr />

I am looking to do something amazing for my husband. I was wondering if anyone could create a custom game using custom drawn characters that I would provide.<br /><br />I would like it to be at least one world or enough to play through...not sure on the semantics. I also understand that being a specific custom game for one person would cost more, which I would like to discuss at the start but am willing to pay.<br /><br />Not sure what other information is need, but could/would you or anyone you know be able to create something like this?<br /><br />Fingers Crossed,<br /><br /><img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /> Savvy<br /><br />I also posted this in general-just wanted to cover all my bases.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=6692">Savvy</a> — Sat Sep 20, 2014 4:12 am</p><hr />
