<br />Did you find Screw Attack yet?  If so, did you manage to do it without any further clues or maps?  I tried to leave some exploration left in my spoiler/hint.

<br />It's amazing how many critters you can kill in one jump. I think anything that can be damaged by the screw attack dies in one touch.

<br />No.  The bosses, Kraid and Ridley can be damaged by it, but they don't die immediately.  It takes a lot of screwing to kill those two.

<br />
<br />Actually, my nintendo is packed away at the moment, so I haven't been able to look for it yet.  When I was playing through it recently, I tried not to look up any hints or maps or anything, cause I hadn't beat it yet.

But something about that cheat annoys me:  Sluggy the Unshaven can be approached in its regular size before the dialogue sequence, but it can't be hit with an egg.  So the game actually contradicts itself.  You can kill one boss in its regular enemy state, but not another.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />It was an early form of the &quot;limit break&quot;. It occurs occasionally when a character is near death and you've chosen a regular attack. You'd see it more often if you let your characters HP go low a lot, but that's kind of a dangerous way to live. I can't remember if they were listed in the manual or something, but I remember knowing about it at the time. It might have been mentioned in a game magazine I read or something.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xc3f00xAJFc" class="postlink">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xc3f00xAJFc</a>
