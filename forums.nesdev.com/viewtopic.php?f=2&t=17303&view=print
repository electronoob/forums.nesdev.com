The left 8 pixels are hidden. (Hardware feature.) That's enough to hide any 8x8 tile seam. The only errors that will show will be attributes.<br />2. The 4 background palettes all have 3 common colours, so 3/4 colours in a wrong attribute error will still show correctly.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Certain high-end mappers (Namco 129/163, Nintendo MMC5, and MMC3 configured as TLSROM) support diagonal mirroring, and it can be added to any cartridge board with a single XOR gate: A10 out = PA10 xor PA11.<br /><br />But that's not what <em>Paperboy</em> uses. <a href="http://bootgod.dyndns.org:7777/profile.php?id=230" class="postlink"><em>Paperboy</em> is CNROM with horizontal mirroring</a>, and <a href="http://bootgod.dyndns.org:7777/profile.php?id=1216" class="postlink"><em>Paperboy 2</em> is UOROM with horizontal mirroring</a>. This means there is a seam on the left or right side, but you're just not noticing it, possibly because it's mostly masked by the window function that hides the left 8 pixels.<br /><br />Usually not even the window function can hide attribute errors in games that use horizontal scrolling with horizontal mirroring, such as <em>Super Mario Bros. 3</em> and <em>Kirby's Adventure</em>. But this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DAKnKCVrs7c" class="postlink">video of <em>Paperboy</em></a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ElvUnmsStF0" class="postlink">video of <em>Paperboy 2</em></a> show that each horizontal row has only four colors: black, gray, green, and the color of a particular house. This means there is only one attribute for a whole 256x16-pixel row, causing attribute wraparound to leave no visible artifacts.

Palette usage in this game is atrocious!<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">popeye3417 wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">I thought when the Paperboy port was made, the NES didn't have diagonal scrolling bankswitching boards. There doesn't seem to be any garbage area either. So how did they do it?</div><br />Like I said a few times before, a stock NES (i.e. NROM) can do clean 8-way scrolling if the programmer is careful enough. There are a number of ways in which scrolling artifacts can be hidden, although there's usually something that has to be sacrificed to make it possible.<br /><br />Like tepples said, Paperboy is merely using one of these techniques, which is to use a single palette across the entire axis where the artifacts would be, and the price for that is the game only gets a few colors to draw a lot of different things, and the overall quality of the graphics ends up taking a significant hit.
