This means that it effectively looks at the IRQ/NMI input just before that time, i.e. what its status was on the next-to-last clock. This would account for most of the latency. I'm thinking I need to be more precise about the pipelining.</div>
<br />
<br />Right, due to the two-stage pipeline, the bus cycle is actually at the start of the next opcode when NMI/IRQ is tested, but the work cycle that sets the flag for it is one cycle behind. Hence, there's no need to simulate the pipeline, but you must check for NMI/IRQ triggered at the <em>start</em> of the last cycle of each opcode. You might also run into the same issues as the SNES, where a game can call SEI, and since the last work cycle is the one to set the I flag, the IRQ test will still use the old value of I since it tests prior to setting it.
<br />
<br />It probably needs to test here so that the opcode to execute can be overridden if the work cycle IRQ test deems it necessary. I imagine the CPU executes interrupts just like they were special opcodes.
<br />
<br />The SNES has some interesting quirks where reading the IRQ status flag while the pin is transitioning for 4 clock cycles will result in the IRQ status flag remaining set for the next read as well. Whereas if you read it &gt;4 clock cycles after it is set, the status bit goes low and does not read as high twice. And there's more quirks, too. But I'd have to look at my documents to say what they were.

<br />
<br />This is exactly what it does.  It forces the 00h opcode (BRK) into the
<br />opcode latch.  The interrupt logic also controls the break flag... and 
<br />because of this, it's more a status bit rather than a flag.  It is not possible 
<br />to set or clear this flag in software.

Timing the demo so that it would keep in sync even when dpcm was stealing cycles wasn't easy when I could use just one sprite scroll hit and lots of timed code to keep in sync. So there are a few tunes where you can occasionally see the scrolltext glitch. And correctly, boomfunk shows the biggest problems. I don't think it's that noticable in the other tunes though.

<br />I'm sorry to dig this thread WAY up, but I just figured something by testing the Years Behind demo on my powerpak.
<br />The demo doesn't EVER get any glitches on my NES, not even in boomjunk. The scrollbar NEVER shakes like it does in Nestopia and Nintendulator currently, proving the so called high accuracy of those is overrated. To my surprise it's VirtuaNES, a medium accurate emulator, which emulates this demo the best.
<br />
<br />The only "glitches" I see is palette updates on the topleft and bottom right of the scrolltext. Both Nestopia and Nintendulator show glitches to all 4 corners - which is wrong.
<br />
<br />As such the info on the wiki by stating Years Behind as an "almost compatible" demo is wrong - it's fully compatible - and the person who wrote that likely did it based on Nintendulator's result.

<br />I have the same problem the other way arround - I can code PAL and NTSC compatible NES programs, but can only test them in PAL mode.
<br />
<br />What tepples said would fix the most noticeable bug of Nintendulator &amp; Nestopia, but even when not playing samples it seems it doesn't emulate it perfectly. I've taken pics, but unfortunately it seems the server I use is down or something for now so I'll upload them whenever I get the occasion.
<br />
<br />In summary, it seems both Nestopia and Nintendulator are innacurate at emulating the glitches arround the scrolling text.
<br />
<br />EDIT : Probably it's that "$3f00" adressing which hasn't been stress tested enough. Maybe there is a list of a few more things that should be stress tested in order to improve the accuracy of emulators.
<br />- $3f00-$3fff adressing during rendering
<br />- Sprite overflow flag
<br />- Effect of $2003 register on sprite DMA
<br />- $2003, $2004 and $2007 acess during rendering

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Here you are some pics so people can compare. I'm at this very time running the demo on my NES and comparing the result with emulators running on my laptop.
<br />
<br />First let's look at the real NES pics :
<br /><img src="http://jonathan.microclub.ch/dummy/DSC00176.JPG" alt="Image" />
<br /><img src="http://jonathan.microclub.ch/dummy/DSC00175.JPG" alt="Image" />
<br /><img src="http://jonathan.microclub.ch/dummy/DSC00174.JPG" alt="Image" />
<br />
<br />And Nestopia &amp; Nintendulator screenshots :
<br /><img src="http://jonathan.microclub.ch/dummy/yb2.png" alt="Image" /> <img src="http://jonathan.microclub.ch/dummy/yb1.png" alt="Image" />
<br />
<br />There is a few problems, not counting the DMC problem I mentionned eariler :
<br />1) The top left corner has a very visible white dash on my NES.
<br />Nestopia have a much shorter white dash, and Nintendulator is even worse, having a short red dash.
<br />
<br />2) The bottom left corner have only an occasional very short dark-blue-ish dash, which seems to be emulated pretty much correctly by Nintendulator and Nestopia - but it is much more noticeable on emulators than hardware (it might be due to incorrect color of the dash but I'm not sure)
<br />
<br />3) The upper right corner have a black dash jittering into the last line of the big white line. Nintendulator &amp; Nestopia seems to emulate this correctly, but it seems the dash are bigger - but I suspect my TV to hide the rightmost pixels.
<br />
<br />4) The lower right corner has a lot of jittering, a really long red dash that goes increasing in luminosity, sometimes becomes white, below the text, and a white dash before the white line. Emulators seems pretty close to the trurth, but it doesn't jitter the same way, and the red dash don't become white at the right side.[/img]
