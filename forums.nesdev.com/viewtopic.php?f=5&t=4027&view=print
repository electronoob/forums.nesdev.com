		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />So for the past couple of days, I've been playing some games on my front-loading NES. I've been having difficulty getting them to function.
<br />
<br />I know that you can clean them with rubbing alcohol and whatnot, but I think that's not the problem. It seems that the pins must be exactly aligned with the pin connector's pin readers. But once I've aligned them, it really only works when I put weight on the top of the cart. Oh, and by the way, I've taken out the black thing you push up and down along with the dust shield, and the plastic cover of the NES.
<br />
<br />Why is it that the games must have something pushing them down? I just want to get to the bottom of what the heck is so hard about getting games to work in the front loader. Any ideas?

<br />edit: wait a moment your removed the black pushy down thingy?
<br />
<br />front loaders need that because the type of connector needs something holding down the cartridge(I forget what that type of connector is called). Top loaders are just use tension and do not require this

<br />About the black thing, I still have it, and I can put it back in. But it's really hard for me to position the cartridge perfectly with it in. It just seemed annoying, so I took it out.
<br />
<br />I just don't understand WHY you need to push the cartridge down in order for it to work. Are the top and bottom pin readers not parallel inside the connector? If they are, I don't understand why you need to push it down.

<br />
<br />You can actually take your connector out and use something like a paperclip to bend the pins back up a tad, but be very careful when you do that so you don't break any or something of the sort. Also, this is just a short term solution, as it won't last forever.

<br />
<br />because its not a tension connector, its designed to not make full contact without it being held down. The idea was so the games would be easy to slide in and out without anything holing it down but it was found that this type of connector wares out too quickley to they lost this idea
<br />
<br />Oviousley the black thingy wont be much good without a case for the cartrige if you want to do without it hold it down with something else or leave a game genie inside.
<br />
<br />dont put too much pressure on it or the connector with just wear out more quickley

<br />
<br />On my other two NESs, the lockout is disabled. One I tried to turn into a CopyNES, but for some reason, it didn't seem to work. It's not even really a blinking issue a lot of the time, it's just a gray screen.
<br />
<br />Is there any way to tighten the connector? When I first bought it, it was a lot tighter than it is now. It actually worked perfectly when I bought it. It seems like if there's a way to make it loose, it's possible there's a way to make it tight again.

<br />But I have to agree that the front loading connector is a piece of crap. Is it possible at all to install a top-loading connector? Or would that just be a big shindig?
