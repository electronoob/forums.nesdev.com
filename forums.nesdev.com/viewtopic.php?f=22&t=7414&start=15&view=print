If more people can access a .zip file than a .7z without downloading a new extraction tool then why not use .zip? Is using the 'best' compression tool worth alienating potential users of your software? Perhaps 7zip is more common that I think, in that case I my point is moot. Sorry for the rant, it is just something that befuddles me.</div>
<br />
<br />Think of it this way, it could be a SIT, LHA or GZ file. I think 7z is overrated especially for tiny data archives, but it's become the defacto standard for ROM distribution, so you may want to just break down and install the decompression tool.  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />

<br />That is a good reason to install it, and exactly the kind of input I was look for. I will keep that in mind when I post stuff up. I think I will post my stuff in .7z, .zip, and heck even my own favorite .tar.gz then let people choose which to download <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />
<br />
<br />And sorry for hijacking this thread, I brok down and installed 7z (which was quick and painless in Ubuntu) so I could try the rom. It's pretty darn cool, I really like the segmented animation.

If you have five files, all of which are nearly identical, then 7z can take advantage of redundancy between files. For example, NTSC and PAL versions of a game will usually differ little.<br /><br />And think about it this way: more people can access a <a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Retraux" class="postlink">retraux</a> PC game for Windows (e.g. Eversion, La-Mulana, Cave Story) using only software that comes with a PC than an NES game. More people have Windows, Mac OS X + Wine, or Linux + Wine than have Windows + an NES emulator, Mac OS X + an NES emulator, or Linux + an NES emulator. This is especially true considering that Fedora ships Wine but refuses to ship any NES emulators out of fear of <em>Nintendo v. Red Hat</em>.<br /><br />As for .gz, most GUI tools that can handle .zip can handle .gz. Surely every tool on Mac OS X, Ubuntu, and everything not made by Microsoft can.<br /><br /><br /><span style="font-size: 84%; line-height: normal">* See <a href="http://encyclopediadramatica.se/Winrar" class="postlink">this ED article</a> for context.

<br />And now, another update:
<br />
<br />Now the player code can also animate the tile indexes of the sprites, so now nicer animations can be built.
<br />
<br />I updated the walk cycle animation to reflect the new changes.

<br />Yes, I should have added that as I changed the tile data layout I broke the standing up animation, and because the animation format changed I have to do the stand-up animation again, so I didn't bothered to fix it. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />

Personally I prefer the non-animated one in the previous version. Maybe if 1. there are more frames to the animation (sacrificing more CHR space), or 2. have the mecha move/animate faster, or 3. have the cockpit bog up and down by one or two pixels during the animation it could look really nice.

<br />
<br />You mentioned that you're developing an animation tool.
<br />
<br />What does it output?  Asm code, binary data or something in-between?
<br />
<br />What kind of data does it hold in memory (sprite lists, connection points, hit-boxes, etc... )?
<br />
<br />What platform does it run on (pc, mac, bsd, linux, solaris)?
<br />
<br />What language did you implement it in?

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Thanks for your opinions! I will try to make it more natural as the game development progresses.
<br />
<br />The tool outputs a binary file that holds timestamps and interpolation values for the keyframes of the animation.
<br />
<br />The structure in RAM which hold the current values for each sprite uses 2 bytes + 15 bytes per sprite used on the animation.
<br />
<br />The ROM data as you might guess, its a lot bigger.  For example the stand-up animation uses 259 bytes  and the walking cycle needs 429 bytes.
<br />
<br />Im doing the program in C++ using GTK+, so it should be easily compiled for every platform where GTK+ is available (I tried it on Windows and Fedora)
<br />
<br />But its still very fragile, and a lot of the GUI options are not working, so I want to wait its just a little bit more ready before releasing it.
