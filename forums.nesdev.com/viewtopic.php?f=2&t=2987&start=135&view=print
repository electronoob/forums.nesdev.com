Some touch screens, for example, sample multiple times to ensure more accurate position readings. Keyboard input is often heavily processed based on an assumption, valid most of the time, that the keyboard is used for inputting text in any of several languages, some of them with fairly complex writing systems. And some adapters from classic SPI controllers to USB add latency as well. Furthermore, video and audio latency contribute to the perception of lag; an operating system's media subsystem may be geared toward the CPU-efficient and/or battery-efficient playback of noninteractive music and video more than toward gaming.</div><br />The biggest offenders tend to be unlicensed games on consoles though =P

There's not really much more to tell, unless you count a rough sequence of what got reverse-engineered...

Why are broken brick pieces changed into white balls when you touch the flagpole? The world may never know... :\<br /><br />(though my theory for the latter is that fireworks were originally going to use the brick-breaking routine, just with the brick graphics changed to something more firework-like)
