Since Tokumaru "nerd side" hoped for accurate emulators to work, I had chance to test a few of them during lunch time.<br /><br />[Nestopia]<br />- Without NSTC filter and size at 1x, you can run at 60fps<br /><br />[Nintendulator]<br />- If you set raster on, you can go up to 50 fps but still glitch.  Removing the song sometime make it faster.  <br /><br />[FCEABCEF]<br />- 1.07 (SP?) works fine<br />- 2.1.1 was working fine but now glitch. Don't know the cause yet (not connected to AC?). Same thing for 2.1.0<br /><br />[VirtualNes]<br />- Works fine and fast. You can put screen in 2x and no issue.<br /><br />So depending what you do that can be more than enough. I will do more testing when I have a chance.<br /><br />Oh, and by the way, I can run VS2008 on it so it's not that bad after all.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3559">Banshaku</a> — Thu Jul 01, 2010 11:38 pm</p><hr />

@Tokumaru<br /><br />Yeah, I would have liked if you could use the most accurate emulator for some testing but I will have to live with it. Maybe it's time to optimize their code for weaker cpu then? <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" /><br /><br />@Bregalad<br /><br />If it was just me, I would have bought a Lenovo thinkpad X201s but that didn't pass in my budget (1700$). It's bigger than a netbook but almost the same weight (!).  Or I could have gone with a second hand X61 but portable breaks more easily than PC so I didn't do so. The X61 runs all emulators pretty well and can even run a VM with Win7 so it's not so shabby.<br /><br />For now I should see the good side: I can now work on my projects. That's already a big + compared to before when I couldn't do anything. Now I need to decide on which project I will focus.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3559">Banshaku</a> — Thu Jul 01, 2010 6:48 pm</p><hr />

Well some people might go very well with a tiny net-book and use inaccurate emulators on it, and then go back home, and test on their desktop PC with accurate emulators.<br /><br />Personally I took the path to have a mid-sized notebook (14'') that entierely replace my desktop. It it pretty powerful (in fact more than my old desktop ! - even tough it was only 3.5 years old 1 year ago when I changed it) so it runs all emulators and PC games fine, and that extra space it saves on my desktop is really nice (in fact I couldn't imagine to revert now !).<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"><br />That always happens.<br /></div><br />Man this is so true !! 6 months ago Lenovo released laptops similar to mine but with Quad-Core CPUs intead of Dual Core, same GHz, same price !<br /><br />4 years ago when I mounted my desktop computer, the AMD X2 series of dual cores were released right after I bought my Athlon 64 class CPU - and PCI express just became the norm right after I bought a mother board that lacked it. Not to mention typical RAM on PCs suddently grop from 512Mb to 2GB without a good reason. (and still is in the 2-4GB now a few years later...) You see the picture....<br />If you are careful to always buy stuff right after a "big" evolution it's alright - but for me I have a tendency to always do the opposite !<br /><br />I also tend to buy game consoles just when they're about to get obsolete, but that's another story. This has plenty of advantage - you can get the "slim" revision of the system and you can buy plenty of good used games for it for cheap. However, it usually happens I can't find games I'd like to buy - they're sold out and I can't find them used.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=38">Bregalad</a> — Thu Jul 01, 2010 1:32 pm</p><hr />

In the end I finally made my decision and went with a normal netbook since there was a risk that the small one was not that useful on the train and be too constrained. At easily more than 150$ extra, I didn't take the risk to see how useful it is.<br /><br />Now I'm in the middle of configuring it so I can at last do some nes coding again. The CPU is a N450 (the norm recently) and I did a quick test this morning with 2 emulators.  Nintendulator runs at 26 fps so you can forget it for debugging. As for one version of FCEX, it seems to work fast enough. <br /><br />I'm happy that I waited. The one I got (asus eee pc 1001px) just came out last week in japan.  The screen is mate so no glare because of light. It still come with XP and I'm more than happy with that since win7 starter is quite a piece of junk.<br /><br />Can't wait to finish setting it so I can program nes programs/tools again during lunch.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3559">Banshaku</a> — Wed Jun 30, 2010 9:21 pm</p><hr />

So this mean I should be able to use at least Nestopia for accuracy test and maybe fcex for debugging unless this one is too slow too?<br /><br />Visual C#.. The umpc only have 512 meg so I guess that the CPU wouldn't be the only bottle neck. I would still like to test it if I have a chance.<br /><br />Thanks for the information.  The price of the umpc is quite steep so I'm not sure yet if I will jump on it or not.  When you have the choice between a <a href="http://jp.kohjinsha.com/models/pa/index.html" class="postlink">400g umpc</a> that you could use anywhere but the price is like 600/700$ but on the other hand you could get a normal netbook for half the price with 1 gig of ram and N280/N450 but you cannot use on the train..
