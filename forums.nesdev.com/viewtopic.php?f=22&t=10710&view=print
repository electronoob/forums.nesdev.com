Like, I recognize the bed OK so I know that the crapper isn't likely to be in the same room.  But the crapper looks like a lower-case j.  The bookcase blends into the background too much [it's less so on the left than on the right].  The sink/oven/fridge look like robots floating in the kitchen?<br /><br />Maybe a bland &quot;tiled&quot; kitchen floor [single color with straight lines] and a lower-contrast &quot;carpeted&quot; look for the rest.  Or perhaps a linear &quot;wood-grain&quot; for the dining area?  I'm not aware of too many houses with the same flooring throughout.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I'm having trouble making some things out. The book case wasn't very obvious, but I eventually got it. The toilet on the other hand, I still can't see. I assume that the &quot;lower case j&quot; is the toilet, but I really don't see it... Oh, I do now, it's facing left, ok. The sink (I assume it's a sink because it's present in the kitchen and in the bathroom) is a tough one too. Kitchen sinks don't usually have columns, but even if the did to top is pretty hard to make out. And what's the thing in the lower right corner of the bathroom? An empty space surrounded by walls?<br /><br />The heavy dithering on the floor really is an issue IMO, it really isn't helping. I do understand that this is all using a single palette, so if you used solid colors for the floor it would lose a lot of depth, but there must be a better solution than dithering the hell out of it with pixels that &quot;adhere&quot; to the tiny objects and make them even harder to make out.

	</div>The grey is the mask I used; the original is included for completeness.<br />The black has problems that would require significantly redrawing the furniture. For the rest, is it any easier to identify what the furniture is? (Trying to decouple &quot;busy floor&quot; from &quot;awkward symbol&quot;)<br /><br />I feel like having explicitly separated the furniture before makes it easier to recognize when back on the carpet.

I plan to have it evaluate the house based on what furniture is near other furniture, and both an oven and a toilet give a bonus for being put near a sink.<br /><br />The space surrounded by walls is probably the same space surrounded by walls seen at 1:00 in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vix3_IuEd5Q#t=58" class="postlink">this video</a> or at 1:50 in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLR9yxIV8DQ#t=108" class="postlink">this video</a>. It happens when four wall tiles in a 2x2 square are present.<br /><br />There are two problems with having different kinds of flooring in different rooms. First, furniture has the flooring behind it baked into the tiles. Second, how would the player set what flooring applies to a given room? It's not like Animal Crossing, where each room is a separate map and the furniture is ultra-low-poly 3D models. But if you can make a better flooring pattern with 8x8 pixel tiles using black, red, and possibly yellow, I'd like to see it. Aesthetically, I'm kind of liking the solid red, but (as shown in the first set of screenshots) the units wouldn't stand out very well in front of it.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">I feel like having explicitly separated the furniture before makes it easier to recognize when back on the carpet.</div><br />So does seeing the furniture being placed.

The line that I think is supposed to be representing the deliniation of *top* in the isomorphic sense (the line that is creating the separation between the body of and the dot of the &quot;j&quot;) seems like it is delineating the bowl/tank separation point, but it's too high to be doing that.  I think if you tipped the toilet so that the bowl is visible as if you were looking down on it...or otherwise make it somehow more isomorphically obvious that the dot-of-the-j-is-the-top.
