The 6502 is indeed a very simple processor, and I feel that the online information is more than enough to cover all aspects of it. In fact, I was able to gather much more (accurate) information from the web than from the couple of 6502 books I could get my hands on.<br /><br />Sometimes people seem to think books are magical things that can teach you anything. Personally, I think the internet is way more powerful than any book, probably because it's searchable, while it's easy to get lost in huge books. I've learned thousands of things from articles and tutorials on the web, but very little from paper books.<br /><br />Anyway, I too think it's a bit annoying how Hamtaro126 comes here every other week asking questions that are completely unrelated to the previous one, expecting some sort of magical simple answer that will fix all his problems.<br /><br />Now, I can understand jumping from one project to another like you change your underwear (I used to be like that too, but I'm glad to say I'm a lot more focused nowadays), but one has to pick projects that are doable. Picking a project you have no idea how to accomplish is not going to take you anywhere, as you are not going to magically learn everything in the process.<br /><br />My advice to Hamtaro126 is to start with simpler projects that requires knowledge you already have. Don't be so ambitious, and increase the complexity a bit from project to project. That way you'll have a chance of actually learning something (as well as practicing something you already know), instead of being lost all the time and never getting remotely close to finishing anything.<br /><br />If you actually want to learn 6502 ASM and PPU/APU coding (not because someone told you to), there's nothing stopping you. Many people on this board came here with zero knowledge of these things (me included), and are now very decent NES coders. You just gotta start from the bottom, like everyone else. There are no shortcuts. As Celius said, the first few steps are the boring/simple sprite/controller/sound demos. Those are not exactly projects (in fact, people would want to hurt the ones releasing that kind of crappy tests, so it's just better to keep them private), but are necessary in order for one to understand how to talk to the system.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=95">tokumaru</a> — Sun Feb 15, 2009 12:58 am</p><hr />

To learn something like this, you have to enjoy the basics. I do that by exploring them thoroughly, aiming to understand them in every respect. Doing something well is enjoyable. I agree that most tutorials aren't very good, perhaps because good ones are hard to write.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=17">blargg</a> — Sat Feb 14, 2009 8:57 pm</p><hr />

People are usually nice with new comers on nesdev.  If they show any willingness of learning and it asked in a proper way, they get a proper answer.  <br /><br />In that case, this is a "special user" that as been here for a while, always asking questions that sometime make no sense. Not because it's not asked in a proper way, he's just asking for something that is impossible or request that you should code the program that he need, jumping from one project to another, mixing technologies for no apparent goal etc. So it's hard to know if he's serious or not.  <br /><br />If he just came to nesdev, I guess that would have been quite a harsh thread and would agree with you but this not the case.  He's just being his usual self so you shouldn't worry too much about it. After a while it can get irritating.  Usually I'm quite cool with that and ignore those messages, just snapped once and wrote something that I could consider harsh (not too proud of it).  <br /><br />Just hope someday that we can see something he did so we can confirm how serious he is.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3559">Banshaku</a> — Sat Feb 14, 2009 5:15 pm</p><hr />
