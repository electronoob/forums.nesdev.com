It confused me why the lower and upper byte of the OAM address should be set to a PPU port register and a CPU register respectively, until I looked them up in the wiki and unsterstood that it was a misunderstanding of how they work. I always thought I had made this misunderstanding by myself, but I guess the comment really came from the Nerdynights tutorial. <br /><br />A correct comment should probably be something like this:<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">obj_update:<br />  lda #$00<br />  sta $2003            ;make sure OAM address $00 is selected as destination start address<br />  lda #$02<br />  sta $4014            ;set the RAM page to be used as source address and invoke OAM-DMA<br /></div><br />OAM is an internal memory in the PPU that is different from VRAM. It's only 256 byte so it doesn't need 16-bit addresses.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=6013">Pokun</a> — Fri Jan 20, 2017 7:00 am</p><hr />

I think leaving unallocated parts of RAM up to chance is bad form and feel a necessity to advise against it. (Summarizing again: you should not intentionally create conditions which aren't reliable from system to system.)<br /></div>As usual, I'll invoke one traditional counterpoint: <a href="http://tasvideos.org/GameResources/NES/FinalFantasy1.html#EncounterAlgorithms" class="postlink">Final Fantasy 1</a> uses uninitialized RAM ($F5-6) for where to start on encounter tables, causing encounters to vary across a RESET-load but not [usually] across a POWER-load. Contrariwise, the in-battle RNG is saved in the save file, and not erased on NEW GAME…but it has been noticed that this variable is eventually zeroed by the code that writes &quot;THE END&quot; in fancy letters, and speedrunners use it to try to achieve a consistent start-up state to get their first encounter escapable as-desired.<br /><br />The initial state of RAM has been found to vary somewhat per-system, but is an annoyingly analog effect, and can take variable amounts of time to return to   from what I've seen of feasel's runs.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">Pokun wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"><br />I have variables that needs to be initialized to 0 all over the place, for example RAM page 2 and 3 is for OAM and VRAM buffers and page 4 is reserved for the sound routine, so looping isn't easy.<br /></div> Initializing OAM to FF is more useful than 00.<br /><br />[hr]<br /><br />Unfortunately, the typical way a loader is run on PowerPak is to run it out of $0400-07ff, which means a naïve RAM-initializer loop would not suffice. Hmm…but that's for another topic, I think.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=6603">Myask</a> — Thu Jan 19, 2017 8:59 am</p><hr />
