So, after the first write to $2006, the NES is expecting the second write, no matter if it's to $2006 or $2005, and in the case of $2005, the second write is the Y scroll. After that, the NES is expecting a first byte again, regardless of the register. We write the X scroll to $2005. Now, with the NES expecting a second write, we finish with the second $2006 byte.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">Drag wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">By the way, that seems to be the same memory mapping of the PPU, except with the upper nybble of the MSB representing the fine Y scrolling, rather than the memory page.

Bit 14, the highest bit of the fine Y scroll, gets cleared during the first $2006 write. This means that you can only use fine Y scroll values 0 to 3. This is the reason you need the $2005 write that comes next, to properly set the fine Y scroll. If that limitation is not a problem for you, you can get away with using only $2006. Don't forget that the fine X scroll can only be set through $2005 though.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">With all due respect to Nintendo and their programmers, the SMB series isn't exactly a shining example of good coding. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" /></div>
<br />Based on what I've already seen, I have to agree with you.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I'd like to add one more thing: all this talk about $2006 and $2005 is for mid-screen scroll changes. During VBlank, before rendering starts, the proper way to set the scroll is by using $2005 and $2000. During VBlank, $2006 should only be used for writing/reading data to/from VRAM. Unless you have a good reason to do it differently, but I honestly can't think of any.

<br />By the way, this is all very useful information to have on the wiki, if it's not there already.
