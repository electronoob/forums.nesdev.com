<br />
<br />Naw, I like it being "sharpened" because it makes pixels look more like pixels.

They'd probably look horrible without a filter.  I'll have to try that.  Or do you have example screenshots ?</div><br />I guess Blaster Master is a good example:<br /><br />*giant picture*<br /><br />Look how the same gray can be used for highlighting both green and brown, and it blends well with both. It really looks like light green at the top of the grass. Also, look at the black dithering at the bottom of the grass. Some black pixels actually blend with the green and create dark green pixels, resulting in a perfectly good shadow effect.<br /><br />Now look at the unfiltered screen:<br /><br />*giant picture*<br /><br />The gray and black don't blend nearly as well with the colors they are supposed to shade/highlight, and are very obvious.<br /><br />The benefit of using this trick is that you can practically fit 2 color scales in a single palette (a lot of games just use 1 gradient per palette), since black can shadow both colors and gray can highlight them. This increases the apparent amount of colors on screen, since there are more hues.</div>

<br />Is it just me or does anyone else think the emu shot stil looks better.

<br />Well, both are emulator shots actually, so you mean the unfiltered one, right? I suppose some people will prefer it that way.
<br />
<br />Long before there was an NTSC filter (like, around 2000 or so) I was fascinated by how images looked more detailed and colorful in video captures than in emulator shots. I would always apply random blurring and noise to my mock-ups (I didn't know how to code for the NES back then, and didn't even have an actual console, so I just spent a lot of my time drawing NES sprites and backgrounds) so that they'd look cooler. Years later I was obviously very pleased when blargg released his filters, because I would be able to see the games as they were supposed to be seen, including my own stuff.
<br />
<br />But I know that not everyone thinks like me, and I accept that. For me, tweaking the graphics to make them look cooler in NTSC is just one more step of the fun that is developing a game, but I guess that, for many people, what I consider to be extra detail and texture is just unwanted noise.
