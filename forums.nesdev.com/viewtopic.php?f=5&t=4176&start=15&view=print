<br />
<br />Its mega man 9, I just read about it the August issue of Nintendo power but I am sure it has already been posted on places around the net.
<br />
<br />graphics wise it looks NESish. and the controlls are 2 button NES style also I suppose it could be emulated but questionable considering they probably don't want to use assembly so I dout it. Although its possiple there are reasons they would do so, in order to reuse old code or get the "retro" look dead on for exsample.

<br />
<br />I have seen one that looked like it had too many sprites on screen at once for that to be possible, but even if they did they do not have to follow the rules for hardware limitations since it would be designed to run on an emulator only.
<br />Anyway more than Likely they used a Wii SDK designed to create Wiiware in some variation of C++, would not bother with ways of doing things that are considered antiquated and they may not even have a team capable of it.

<br />Yes, but there is by far more people with a decently recent PC than expensive recent console, so more potential buyers.
