		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I originally posted this over at the Nestopia forum and was pointed here to post for discussion purposes.
<br />
<br />Given the nature of NSF files, it's not that easy to make files which play individiual tracks contained within the full NSF files. NSFe allowes timing on tracks in an NSFe file, but this is a patch at best and the all tracks are still located in one file. There is a older utility "NSFTrackRipper" which splits NSF files into individual NSF files by tracks, but is limited in scope as to what it can handle and is far from an optimal solution.
<br />
<br />What I was wondering: Is or has there been any interest in making a Nintendo Sound Logger? VGM is a popular logged-file format with the freedom of creating individual files for each track. Sadly, it's focused primarily on the Sega side of things currently. I'm fairly sure a NES compatable .VGM logged file would be accepted by many people.
<br />
<br />What it would take, I'd assume, is someone with the abilities to step up and create a NES logged format. Also, use current technologies (eg. VGM or other NSF players) to allow the playback of this logged information. A converter, too, would be the best to transfer the current NSF files to a new NES logged format.

<br />
<br />I see only one advantage to a logged format, and that is that nearly any computer could play it since there is no CPU to emulate (even another non-6502 8-bit machine could do it).  But the logged data is freaking huge, so it needs to be compressed.
<br />
<br />Is there some other reason a logged format would be useful for that I've overlooked?
<br />
<br />I think it's pretty strange how popular VGM format is with SMS (besides the fact that it has momentum from people using it so much).  With some games people have to go to crazy lengths hacking the game so they can log the music without interruptions.. that's really more work than just locating the sound engine and getting every song and sfx in one go (including hidden ones that the game might never play).
<br />
<br />I'm not sure what that NSFTrackRipper program does, but if it's just having a certain song in one file that you want, it's as easy as changing one byte in the NSF header (the starting song #, maybe the maximum number if you don't want it to go on to the next track automatically).

The distinction is that there would only be 1 byte of data(the song number) that would have any bearing on the song played, and the rest could be tagging information. If programmed correctly, the file may only need to consist of text, and reference a Song tag for the song number to play. Such a system would be easy to use for auto-generated mininsf files, and the original format wouldn't need to change, because it would just be an extension of the format, layered on top of the NSF format.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />The problem I see with the idea of a miniNSF format is that NSFs are already about as "mini" as they will ever need to be. The big reason for miniPSF's existence, as I see it, is so that instruments from individual files can be shared across an entire game soundtrack; on sample-based consoles, this is obviously a significant space reduction. But NSF doesn't have full-length samples anyway; the largest possible DMC sound is 16KB in length, and anything that long would most likely not be shared anyway.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Just to throw my two cents in (I was thinking of this thread just now and had a strong opinion on the matter, so I figured I'd post it).
<br />
<br />There's no need for a standard format for logged NES music since logs can be extracted from an NSF file, and playback is not at all processor-intensive. In a sense an NSF file already contains all the sound data, but in a highly compressed form. If you have a specialized application that needs logged data, modify one of the several open-source NSF players to log data you need. The format is can be whatever works for you, since there's no benefit gained by using a standard format.
<br />
<br />The same goes for any other logged formats which have been superseded by ripped formats. For example I've recently come into possession of many Sega Master System rips in KSS format, making the previous VGM logs obsolete.

<br />
<br />So there's an example of a specialized application for it, kinda cool too, though my way was impossible to use DPCM with.  Probably not what Tafoid has in mind though, heheh.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Myself, I am open to any options as to how to produce and handle NES sound.  Logging, while producing larger files for the same gain as NSF's, are still MUCH better than WAV or even MP3's as far as consumed storage.  The advantages stated before of portability to other devices, too, are important.
<br />
<br />OPTIONS is all I'm looking for - Options that a normal end-user can employ to create/manipulate/transfer NES Sound.  A majority of end-users lack specific ASM knowledge or C programming skills to accomplish these tasks on thier own.  I guess my plea comes mostly from my inability currently to rip my own NSF's or code up my own solutions with the given sources.
<br />
<br />I'm not certain how it is with NES Sound Data, but there are many games for the Super Nintendo which are unable to be saved via the normal SPC Dumps.  In this case, logging of the games would be a viable alternative.
<br />
<br />I am also not opposed to a PSF-type approach either, anything that will allow me an unfettered access to a certain track immediately without editing NSF headers or modifying game code is a plus!  We cannot forget loop points, timings and even fading - all important.
<br />
<br />Thanks for your input, everyone!

<br />
<br />Interestingly enough, there's already a format that enables both tag data, track selection, timing and all that other glut. It's even supported by one of the best NSF players (NSFPlug), though adding support to other players should be fairly trivial (both NSFPlug and NEZPlug from which the format originates are open source).
<br />
<br />I'm talking about extended M3U. And really, talking about mininsf or other similar format when that's available is kinda pointless, you know?

<br />I don't know much about NES music, but is it really possible to make NSF's of <strong>any</strong> game? Aren't there any games that use some weird routines to play their music that doesn't fit the scheme used in NSF's?
<br />
<br />The nice thing about NSF's is that they can be inserted back into NES programs/games and all, but I guess that logged sound is best for playback only (in some sort of audio player, not a game system).

Aren't there any games that use some weird routines to play their music that doesn't fit the scheme used in NSF's?</div><br />Well, I really cannot find any. The worst thing that comes to mind would be merge some sound routines with some totally unrelated routines, wich no programmer would want to do anyway. The routine that would have nothing to do with sound could be "hidden" somewhere in the sound playback routine and freze the code if you don't run it with the complete game engine, wich is the case of NSF players. That would fit the NSF format by replacing a call by NOPs, but it would give a very very hard time to the NSF ripper.<br />Also, some code that would wait for a DPCM IRQ that would be triggered by not-sound code or a sound code that relies on mapper registers to run would be pretty bad. I know Low-G-Man relies on open bus at $6000-$7fff, and Just Breed relies on the MMC5 multiplier at $5205-$5206. Without those, both sound codes will crash.<br />Finally there is Battletoads with its infamous PCM playback (only on title screen, winning music and stage-advance-custcene music). I think it worked pretty well without the PCM playback, but it simply won't fit the NSF format with the PCM playback unless Quietust updated it (and only Nintendulator support it yet anyway...)<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">The reason some SNES games are undumpable is that they update the music via the 65816, which the SPC format doesn't emulate.</div>
<br />Well, the music can only be updated by the SPC700 code techinically, but some games have SPC700 playback codes that relies on communication with the 65C816 CPU to run. Most playback codes only communicate on song change and to play sound effects. Some games also have SPC dumps that doesn't work for some obscure reason, but that people have managed to get working on the SPC format (Terranigma, Fire Emblem 4 and 5, Super Famicom Wars and Rudra no Hihou comes in mind). Eventually, there is Tales of Phantasia and Star Ocean were the SPC run pretty well on its own, but have trouble playing some instruments and of course voice playback where the main CPU constantly communicates with the SPC700 to refresh sample data in a double-buffered algorithm.

<br />
<br />The solution, of course, is to make an SNES equivalent of NSF which does <strong>not</strong> simply take a RAM snapshot of the SPC700. Sure, it'd be a bit more difficult to do (would require actual effort above just playing through the game) and would require a slightly beefier player (would have to emulate the 65816 as well as the SPC700), but they would be <strong>radically</strong> smaller - as it is, most SPC soundtracks are larger than the original game's ROM image!
<br />
<br />Don't even get me started on Sega Genesis/Megadrive music logs - once the raw PCM is added, <em>one song</em> exceeds the size of the entire game...
