I've played more of Company of Heroes and I'm liking it so far. From the little I've played of  Supreme Commander, the scale seems to be huge. Especially coming from Starcraft 2.

I always hear good things about Dune 2, but it may be a little harder to track down a copy. I was also playing around with Sins of a Solar Empire. It was going smoothly until  some other empire warp jumped to my home planet and kicked my ass.  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_eek.gif" alt=":shock:" title="Shocked" />

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />XCOM UFO Defense is a classic.  It can get really intense, trying to keep most of your people alive (so their stats can grow which makes the mid/late game survivable).  Jagged Alliance has similar gameplay, but wasn't as fun to me, overall.<br /><br />Evil Genius is similar to Dungeon Keeper 2, and is pretty well made.<br /><br />Black and White is another I enjoyed, if you like &quot;god games&quot;.  It's sorta like a successor to Populous (both by the same designer).  I seem to remember liking the 1st one better than the 2nd, but I'm not sure why.  It's been quite a while since I had played either.<br /><br />Floor 13 is a really different kind of strategy game.<br /><br />Nectaris is another really good one.  It was originally by Hudson Soft for the TG16/PCE, but there was a later PC port with more levels.  The thing with the game is that the later levels get very difficult.  It didn't seem unfair though, it's just that the AI is totally ruthless.
