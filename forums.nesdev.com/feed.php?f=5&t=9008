No one forced you to post any of the other threads you've made on this. That was your own conscious decision. Do you know what personal accountability is? The thing that gets me about this is that you've blamed others (not just me) in the past for drama that you instigated yourself and that was years ago. I've only remembered it after reading that quote...<br /><br />Also, if that PM is inflammatory, keeping in mind I made an effort to make all my criticism constructive, then what do you call this thread you posted? What do you call the other threads on nesdev where you went as far as to <em>create imaginary scenarios</em> to discredit people? You're not in a position to make these sorts of judgement calls.<br /><br />ccovell's right. No one else cares about this. That's why I sent a private message instead of cluttering up nesdev like you've done so here and elsewhere. The whole 'fishing for respect' thing while trying to discredit others is beyond pathetic, seriously. You've brought the drama into nesdev numerous times so that pretty much means you're also making this nesdev's problem, not just ours. Why do you think it's OK for this forum to be polluted with this sort of thing just so you can "win" at something so trivial?<br /><br />tepples, Kasumi and ccovell make a number of valid points here and the post you quoted from SMWC was also addressed in a few points in my PM if you read it. Please don't ignore them.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3295">smkd</a> — Wed Jun 13, 2012 7:51 am</p><hr />

You may not be in control of smkd's PM-writing ability, but you ARE in control of your reactions afterwards.  Make them calm and civil (or hell, even do the mature thing and have NO reaction) and you win respect.  Make them knee-jerk inflammatory and you're just digging your own hole.<br /><br />Nobody is going to side with you if you carry on like this.  Nobody has sympathy for drama queens.  Nobody is taking sides anyway.  We're just seeing a situation happen that we don't know or care how it started.

That's the same reason you've been getting banned constantly from all these forums. *That's* why you got banned and yeah, it was your own fault and has nothing to do with your ability as a programmer (hahaha what?). People who have meltdowns over the most ridiculous shit generally get banned from forums and you're no exception.<br /> <br />The above paragraph is just stating the obvious but you seem to have a lot of trouble with this concept. It's really concerning that literally years have passed and you're still angry about drama that I would've forgotten ages ago if you didn't keep bringing it up. I smell some deep seated mental issues that I really hope are being medicated.<br /> <br />I'm saying this for pretty much every forum you've been banned from or had drama with so far too, not just this one. The stuff in the OP (and elsewhere) is some of the most twisted logic I've ever seen and it's not the first time I read it either. The petty grudge over something real trivial that happened years ago is just the icing. If what you said were true, the other 1600 active users would be in a lot of trouble right now but somehow they aren't.<br /> <br />I'm closing this since on top of being in the wrong forum, there's nothing good that will come of this. If you'd like to kick and scream at me in PMs that's fine, but shitting up the forums with this sort of stuff will get you banned like it would for anyone else.<br /></div><p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=4383">psycopathicteen</a> — Wed Jun 13, 2012 6:42 am</p><hr />

It's a dick move to post private messages.<br /><br />It was important and useful for you to post this, why? So we would suddenly see your side of things and say things like, "Oh man, you've been right about this guy all along!"? <br /><br />Mission failed. Dude's trying to extend an olive branch, makes good points, doesn't clutter up the forum with the drama by constantly posting about this feud despite the fact that no one on here wants to be part of it...<br /><br />And your response is to post his heart to heart? How is that mature? Every single time you post about this, it makes it more clear to me the problem is now you, and the problem is completely yours. Even if the problem <em>used to be</em> partly him, that was <strong>years</strong> ago, and he's clearly a better person now. I think you've got a persecution complex. I can't speak for others, but you're not convincing me. You're doing the opposite.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3504">Kasumi</a> — Wed Jun 13, 2012 5:22 am</p><hr />
