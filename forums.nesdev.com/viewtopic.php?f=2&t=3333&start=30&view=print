It's perfectly possible to run a japanese cart into a 72-pin slot. Of course, as far as I know, extra sound won't work (Konami VRC6, as example). The Famicom <strong>has</strong> a few differences in its hardware, and you seem to unknown your own words about 'region'.

It's a mid-screen palette switch... The NES isn't known for doing this well, or at all.. The NEC V30 on the drive aids this for the NES, by directly accessing the NES CRAM and modifying the values itself (also by monitoring where on the level you are..) You can notice an effect of the V30 playing "catch up" in 2 frames.. Right when sonic goes down low enough, notice TWO frames are exactly the same, except on one frame, the watter is too low, not even in place, where the other frame the water "caught up"...~</div><br /><br />Wtf? You're misunderstanding the things. The NES can kick your *ss with color emphasis, which would make sense. I don't know about 'mid-screen palette <strong>writes</strong>' though... since it implies the PPU address change.

<br />&lt;sarcasm&gt;Yes, my DVD player has a NES emulator with frameskipping!&lt;/sarcasm&gt;

<br />Even a picture of this dvd unit connected to an NES.  A few people have asked to see this and he has yet to produce one.  Not that this proves anything but without seeing a schematic he's just blowing smoke.   Reminds me of the emails kevtris has on his site where someone accused kevtris of stealing his ideas ... and yet he never proved it.

It has axess to the cart expantion pins (that's where their name is from, actualy the pins are just shared by the cart and the expansion port and the cartrige connector without affecting the console in any way), the expansion port has also acess to the unregulated power suply, the CIC clock line (both of them have really the less use I can think of), and the A15 adress missing on the cart connector (a cart that would need it could use an adaptater and pass it trough expantion pins, but this isn't needed because A15 can be reconsituted by inverting /PRG).<br />On the other hand, the famicom expantion port just has acess to some joypad I/O pins (mapped to $4016/7) but he didn't mention the famicom.<br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"><br />So... you're NOT using the sprite RAM, but throwing everything into a 'frame buffer', or the background rendering, the nametables..?

<br />Why? I see no problem with them linking back here... why would they?
<br />
<br />The thing is that the guy made everyone believe the game was running on a stock NES, something he only denied when we started asking questions.
<br />
<br />But I completely lost interest in revealing this fake when he talked about his special DVD drive. If it is something no one else's got but him, I couldn't care less if the game is fake or not. It's not like he's promising to sell this game or anything, so let him play... If other people fall for that, well... they're not losing anything either.
<br />
<br />If he likes to downsample images and sounds and pretend he's playing a functional new game, just let him.
<br />
<br />In fact, even if this was true and he got the game running with his magical DVD drive and it's awesome famebuffer, I couldn't care less. This is not a NES, it's just some wacky hack of a platform.
<br />
<br />I'm perfectly fine with not thinking about this ever again. But let's just see how it goes. I have no intention of posting there ever again, unless something interesting happens.

<br />He don't have the right to sell Sonic anyway, since this is a trademark of Sega. Nor you do, regardless if this is a real NES or a DVD-drive. Only Sega could sell his stuff technically, and they sure won't.

<br />Sure, and I never had the intention to. But people will be able to download it for free.
<br />
<br />What I said is that the guy isn't promising anything, so no one will be disappointed when he doesn't deliver it.
<br />
<br />He'll eventually get tired of playing, and everyone will soon forget about this.

Because I REALLY like the questions you guys are asking evildragon, and it is too soon for it to turn into a flame/insult war (Tokumaru's latest post was worded very well without being insulting).  You guys keep a cool head about it, and I like that.  If you have noticed, I have asked him some interesting questions as well (though not as technical).  Notice the amount of time between when I ask him for a shot of a special stage to when he actually posts a screen.  Not much.  And when I saw the videos with frame skipping instead of just running them ssslllloowwwlllyyy I became suspicious.
<br />
<br />But it is good entertainment.  Just don't be an ass and all things will be cool.

Yeah, at first I was overreacting a little about this, but thanks to Bregalad's suggestion of asking questions instead of flaming, things ended up pretty well. I would have regretted saying what i first intended to.<br /><br />I have no intention of starting a fight (like the one in that other thread), we're better off just asking questions. That guy is very dodgy though, so I've just given up. I really don't care about the authenticity of his projects anymore.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">If you have noticed, I have asked him some interesting questions as well (though not as technical).</div><br />Yeah, I got that.

<br />I admit I'm still curious as to how all of this will end. I don't want to fight, and when I say I lost the interest in the project i really mean it. Fake or real, makes no difference to me anymore.
<br />
<br />I really hope he comes up with more material though, it is fun to see it. But My guess is that he will eventually get tired of it. Then maybe come up with an excuse of why it isn't working out and he'll drop it. Everyone will probably forget about this soon.
