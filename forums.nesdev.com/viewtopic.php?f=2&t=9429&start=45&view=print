THAT SUCKS. There's the infamous disappearing ape on Cheetahmen 2 that will allow you to get stuck on the boss of the game infinitely. I've also had it<br />on games (I can't think of which one off the top of my head) where I've been stuck with no way to die/start the level over. Serious problem.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />A couple of these are just my own elaborations on what's already been said because for the most part I agree with all of it..  Except the part where invisible coin blocks that kill you are ever good.  They aren't.<br /><br />-Disorientation.  Like jumping the hoverbikes in Battletoads.  As opposed to jumping around and throwing pipes in River City Ransom where you can pretty much always &quot;feel&quot; where you are.<br /><br />-ALL CAPS if you can help it.  Understandable though if you can't.<br /><br />-Forced backtracking.  At least in say Final Fantasy VI, they mask it by giving you new, cool people to use.<br /><br />-Forced collection is far worse though.  I could never finish Yoshi's Island for example because my OCD made me <em>need</em> to collect all the crap in the level, but because I was being <em>forced</em> to collect it by negative reinforcement, aka a lesser score, it just pissed me off.<br /><br />-I agree that unnecessary management is bad, but to expound: unnecessary mechanics.  Like, instead of just going down the stairs in Dragon Warrior, you have to select the STAIR command out of a list.  It's not even management at that point.  It's additional button presses and aggravation.<br /><br />-I hope I'm not alone on <em>this</em> one.  When moving platforms change direction with no warning.  Let's say a platform is moving left to right and back again.  I think there should be a brief moment near the change in direction where the platform decelerates, stops, and then accelerates back up to speed, like the pendulums in CV3, instead of, um, all I can think of is one section in Adventures in the Magic Kingdom where jumping from moving platform to moving platform is made unnecessarily difficult by my inability to track their movement.<br /><br />-And speaking of Mickey Mouse, how about stupid friendly AI?  Stop committing suicide, Minnie, and don't heal me when we have one heal left and my HP is full, generic, computer-controlled RPG ally!<br /><br />-Alarms that never shut up like the low health warning in Metroid, or Navi.<br /><br />-Hand-holding.  I don't think anyone here is really into it though, so that's nice.  But to paraphrase that Sequilitis vid and then David Hellman who made Braid:  game mechanics should be given away cleverly as they're needed, not insultingly and before the player can have the joy of his/her own discovery.  Putting the gameplay instructions in the attract mode like Kirby did was an excellent alternative to in-game help boxes.<br /><br />-Cliched stories.  I don't wanna save another princess.  Maybe for a change I could <em>be</em> the princess.  Or maybe I go through the whole game to save the princess only to find out at the end that she's the Big Bad Boss...  Yeah, that's still cliche.<br /><br />-Making it hard for the returning player to know what he's been doing.  I always thought in RPGs, it would be nice if the record-keeping guy could bring you back up to speed after restoring your save.  Just maybe he doesn't float around your face screaming it at you the whole time you're playing.<br /><br />-Don't kill the rockin tunes by loudly filling up the bosses health bar, Mega Man 1-6!<br /><br />-Sexism.  Female characters don't always have to be sexual or helpless and male characters don't always have to be tough or heroic.

I think that globablly, RPGs tends to be less sexism than other games in general. By the way my game will feature a heroic female main character <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /> And no dumb striptease at the ending (it's everyone's guess which game I'm talking about......)<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">-Don't kill the rockin tunes by loudly filling up the bosses health bar, Mega Man 1-6!</div><br />Didn't cause me any problem, except in Mega Man 4 where the music completely stops when there is a life-bar sound effect AND that the life bar fills slower than in other Mega Man games. But MM4 is the black sheep of the series anyway.

I don't know, but I'm very used to how when you select a stage in Rockman 1 the sound effect of the bonus points accumulating playing along side with the <em>awesome</em> tune (all tunes in the game are awesome, but for some reason this is the most awesome one to me), when the tune is about to stop. In fact, I consider that sound effect <em>part</em> of the tune. In Rockman 2, since the score feature is removed, that sound effect doesn't play any more and I personally feel that something is missing and even think that the tune is not that awesome any more. Similar thing to the health bar sound effect. While I personally do love to hear pure sound tracks I also consider that sound effect part of the boss fight, and sorta part of the tune, though it's not as emotionally moving as the one mentioned above and I can live without it.

Do lowercase in that case and unless you're <em>very</em> careful you'll end up with a squished look, and more often than not it'll just end up looking <em>worse</em> than all caps. Which is something that annoys me from most fantranslations, they insist on doing lowercase but then make lowercase look horrible.<br /><br />Also there's the issue of resolution, if the text is too small you could end up with unreadable lowercase (depending on how the font is styled). Again, same thing.<br /><br />Both of those excuses are pretty much non-existent in higher resolutions since if you can do that chances are you're probably using a variable width font in the first place, and it's very unlikely all caps is going to look good in such a case (small caps can end up looking good though).<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">Heavy wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">-Hand-holding.

What happens is that in many cases the focus is just on the personal lives of a few characters rather than e.g. &quot;hey we have to save the entire world&quot; or something else of epic proportions like that. There aren't many games that just focus on its characters and nothing else.

But for another game using the same engine, there's time to do it right.</div><br />There wasn't that much code reuse back then, and what was there generally wasn't touched at all unless the game really required it.<br /><br />Also remember that rendering text with a variable-width font can eat up <em>a lot</em> of time compared to fixed-width, as well as requiring more RAM usage, more VRAM usage and more VRAM bandwidth usage. If you were tight on time or memory and/or couldn't afford to optimize the code then the option seems obvious.<br /><br />Sprite-based text (as opposed to tilemap-based) kind of got the slack here since to achieve the variable width effect it was enough to just change the X coordinates of the sprites. Also if you had a large font you could kind of cheat - e.g. you could have a font where the average character is 16×16, then the letter &quot;I&quot; could be 8×16 and the letters &quot;M&quot; and &quot;W&quot; could be 24×16, and so on (those sizes would be tile-aligned, making them much easier to handle). This doesn't seem to have been used much, though.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">tepples wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">Perhaps I'm just a fan of the UNROM and SNROM boards.

Thank you.</div><br />At least you didn't squish it =P I'm annoyed at how a lot of people insist on giving them the full width of the tile -_-' Either make it nearly square or squish it vertically (goes along the flow of the text), squishing it horizontally just looks plain wrong.<br /><br />There are a few details such as how serifs are handled that probably could have been done better, but at least it's more readable than several fonts I've seen x_x;<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">tepples wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">Compare it to the downward trend of font sizes for sports score boxes since the mid-2000s, and it's not quite so bad.</div><br />Or games in general, HUDs become nearly unreadable -_-' Everybody is like &quot;if you can afford a 360 you can afford a HDTV&quot; completely ignoring it's an issue of the text being big enough to be readable at a distance in the first place. I can read the small text in modern games but it takes me double as long compared to the bigger text of old games.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">tepples wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">If you feel like it, PM me some of the changes you'd make.</div><br />No need for PM:<br /><br /><img src="http://i.imgur.com/Q52h9.png" alt="Image" /><br /><br />Changed the general size from 4 pixels to 5 pixels to help make lowercase don't look as crap when crammed into that height, though this may mean rearranging some of the text. If you really need the current width I can give it a try again. Also changed the height from 6 to 7 pixels... Remember that most of the text is lowercase characters so the average distance between lines is 3 pixels (and in fact this is also the case with your current font).<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">tepples wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">Tetrisphere, whose rules were even harder for players to &quot;discover&quot;, would boot to the tutorial on a fresh save file.</div><br />I saw some gameplay on YouTube... didn't take me long to figure out the mechanics =P OK, would have taken a bit longer in practice given one wouldn't know anything beforehand, but even then it doesn't look that hard to figure out the basics.
