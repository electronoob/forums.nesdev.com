Or is the NES support for cc65 of no real practical use? (I'm asking because I searched the internet, but have never seen even an NES demo program written in C.)<br />If the latter is the case, are there any other compilers for programming NES games in a high level language or do I finally indeed have to resort to Assembler to get it done?<br /></div><br /><br />I guess this thread is a bit old already, the original poster didn't ever reply and the topic got to other issues, but if I may...<br />Although I agree with what was said here that the best choice to develop for NES is pure assembler, you actually can code in C for the NES.<br />I made a background+sprite+split scrolling demo and a metronome for the NES, to test a C library for CC65 I made, although it's very basic and I'm not working on it anymore.<br />But you actually can make demos and games with C.<br />I actually plan to re-write the library in assembler, so it's faster, but still has function definitions to call from C.<br />The bottomline is of course you can read and write from and to memory with C, you can compile for NES with cc65, so it's perfectly possible to write games for NES in C.<br />Will they be as efficient as if written in assembler? nope.<br />Although you should know that the NES support in cc65 is rather poor. By default it sticks an entire ASCII charset into the CHR-ROM, and implements printf and such functions that make no sense in the NES.<br />But with a little tweaking of config files, you can clean all that and make a decent NES program.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3773">Petruza</a> — Sat May 08, 2010 8:01 am</p><hr />

For me, the absolute best tutorial for NES programming was <a href="http://nesdev.com/NES101.zip" class="postlink">Michael Martin's NES 101 tutorial.</a> It has a complete program compilable by P65, an assembler written in perl. It demonstrates the basics of sprites, backgrounds, sounds and input.

Memblers is right... the type of scrolling does affect the design of your game engine pretty heavily, so that's probably the first thing to get out of the way.<br /><br />I'd say that although making games on the NES isn't that much different from other systems, it's a bit harder to make serious design changes later on. Good programmers will obviously try to make the different parts of the program independent of each other, but eventually, usually for performance reasons, things end up merging more than we'd like.<br /><br />So I guess that if you want to avoid multiple recoding cycles, it's better that you start out with a good notion of what kind of game you want.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=95">tokumaru</a> — Sun Jan 10, 2010 8:36 am</p><hr />

Assembly isn't all that hard, especially if you do know C and are familiar with pointers and such.

I never had problems with pointers. And I know binary, hexadecimal, bitwise operations and the two's complement quite well.<br /><br />Now I have two more questions that I need to know in advance:<br /><br />1. What's the best tutorial to read? I found a lot tutorials that teach you how to program the NES, but what is the best, the most complete and the most comprehensive one?<br /><br />2. When I program an NES game, do I have to know how the game shall look like from the beginning? I mean, when I program with C++ or any other high level language, I can start making a game without actually knowing what the game will be like at all.<br />At first I start with general graphic stuff: Creating an image class, giving it methods to load a bitmap, to write its bitmap or a part of it to the back buffer with or without transparent background, to write the back buffer to the screen etc. (DirectX is not that convenient here, so a bit of selfmade encapsulation is necessary.)<br />Then I will create a level class on the logic side. (Like, a level internally consists of a two-dimensional array when the game has a top-down perspective.)<br />Then I will make the graphic part capable of diplaying the level that is represented on the logic part. (I still have no idea what the game will be about.)<br />Then I program a movable character class and let the graphic part display any characters in the levels too.<br />Then I can slowly think of what the game shall actually do. I derive classes from the character class so that I have a player class whose objects receive manual input and an opponent class whose objects move according to a certain pattern.<br />Then I can evaluate the game situation and make the game react to enemy touch (loss of energy or the loss of a life with the reset of the level), reaching the exit (loading of the next level) etc.<br />So, as you see, I can spend a huge time with programming the basic stuff and I still don't need to worry yet if the game shall become a "Pac-Man" or a "Zelda" or a top-down car race. I can decide that later and don't need to rewrite existing code, just add new stuff accordingly.<br />Is that also possible with NES programming?

I guess it all comes down to what motivates you. If your goal is to make a game quickly regardless of what platform you write it for, the NES is probably not a good platform for you. If your goal is specifically to make a game that actually works on a real classic video game system, then it may be worth the extra effort to learn assembly.<br /><br />I know for me, it really came down to the fact that I loved the NES as a kid, still love it and play it, and thought there would be nothing cooler than making a game for it. Plus, it will be really easy to show what I make to others. Millions of people have a NES and even more people have an NES emulator on their toaster, cellphone, PC, dvd player or what have you.<br /><br />So if that's the reason you're interested in it, I'd say go for it. Assembly isn't all that hard, especially if you do know C and are familiar with pointers and such. Beyond that, you will need to learn hex and binary number systems, bitwise operations, and 2's complement math is useful as well.<br /><br />I learned those concepts from <a href="http://www.duntemann.com/assembly.htm" class="postlink">"Assembly Language: Step by Step" by Jeff Duntemann</a>. He targets X86, but many of the concepts carry (heh) over so well to 6502 I recommend it to newbies to assembly language in general.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3735">GradualGames</a> — Sat Jan 09, 2010 7:05 pm</p><hr />
