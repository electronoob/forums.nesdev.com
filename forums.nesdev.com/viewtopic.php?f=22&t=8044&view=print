<br />
<br />Included is the intro stage, the main base, the first boss, and a bit of the caves that follow.  After you reach a pit, you can drop down and the game will end and reset.
<br />
<br />You can play on either normal or easy difficulty.
<br />
<br />Also included is a very short game engine demo stage.  This stage just shows off sample rooms of the abilities and gameplay elements.

<br />
<br />I wish it was longer, but I've still got the first one to finish so I still have a means to quench my thirst for battle kid until this one is released. 
<br />
<br />Any thoughts about completely removing the discussion with the boss after he kills you for the first time or two?  To me the frustration of dying over and over again is aggravated by the fact I've got to keep hitting start repetitively at the proper time.  I can take the two starts to respawn and the screen or two to get back to the boss's lair.  But for me the discussion can easily throw off any sort of rhythm I try to build up, causing another death and aggravation.

<br />
<br />It took me a bit to figure out what was going on as well and I'm using an original controller.  But I suspect it's fairly easy to get used to.  
<br />
<br />I'm guessing you've designed it that way Sivak due to the double jump ability?  The idea being to keep your thumb off the A button once you've jumped, that way your ready to either cling to a wall or double jump.  I could see it still working where you can still be holding A when clinging to a wall.  Reguardless I think if you play it enough to get good at the game you'll get used to however it's setup.

<br />
<br />Hi, yes.  I plan to have "one time cutscenes" where they're only seen for the first fight.  Any subsequent ones will auto skip.  I just hadn't had that setup.
<br />
<br />At least I turned on the skip ability for all of the scenes.  Heheh.  There was a point where some of them didn't have that.
<br />
<br />We're hoping for November, but no guarantees.

<br />Clinging mechanics are (Very) fine for me.
<br />Playing this demo makes me want moooreee.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I've tried several points vertically on that first wall to my right, I can't seem to then cling to the wall on the left, no matter how high or low I am. *edit* nevermind, I finally got it. Not sure why I didn't get it before, I think the timing of letting go of the A right before hitting the wall was more difficult going left than right for some reason. Maybe it should be modified so that you cling no matter what, but you have to release and then press A again to jump off? Might be easier/less frustrating.
<br />
<br />On the other hand, I think perhaps the area you can cling is what threw me off. I definitely was hitting the wall on the left without holding A, but it was maybe "too low" to cling. Is this by design that he can't cling with part of him hanging below the edge of the wall?
<br />
<br />I hope I'm not causing offense with that. I had no gripes with the play control in the first game, it was spot on. And, I'm finding with my own game that feedback like this can make a HUGE difference. Regardless, it is a small flaw. The game is looking great.
<br />
<br />*edit* Now that I know how to do it, I'm really not sure what was throwing me off before. I've seen this with my own game. What feels easy/normal to me cause I program it and play it all the time has caused frustration for my beta testers. On the other hand, Ninja Gaiden was frustrating the first time I played it. It may just be part of learning any NES platformer.

<br />
<br />I could make a control type "B" where A doesn't matter.  I personally hated it that way because you can't really climb quickly and you are instead pressing the D-pad direction into the wall rather than just using A as your method of going on/off.
<br />
<br />Whenever I play, I always let go of A whenever my jump is done.  It's just instinct.  There's no real reason to hold it while falling.

I highly prefer it to not matter whether A is pressed, but instead if your pressing a direction into a wall will make you grab onto it.
