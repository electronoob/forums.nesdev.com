		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I'm not very active nesdev wise these days since the time was not there. Yesterday I was in the mood to work on some note scribble I wrote last month even though I know that my strength is programming, not music ^_^;;
<br />
<br />I decided to share the result from last night at 2h in the morning. As long as you don't expect too much I guess it should be ok! I need to learn more about music if I want more variation in my songs I guess.
<br />
<br />The file is available <a href="http://www14.ocn.ne.jp/~banshaku/misc/new-test3.zip" class="postlink">here</a>.
<br />
<br />I hope you will enjoy it to some degree. Is it finished? Good question, don't know myself <img src="./images/smilies/icon_lol.gif" alt=":lol:" title="Laughing" />

<br />
<br />I may try to improve it by adding more content and making the drum less loud/repetitive. I know that changing the tone &amp; speed made it more interesting too and fitted better for an action game. This is one song that I may use in a game someday.

<br />
<br />The part that is strange, I "may know" which one you're talking about. I guess that must be the part before the end when 2 frames repeat but the solo instrument doesn't use any echo anymore.  This part doesn't comes out right yet to me.  Or maybe I'm searching problems where there's not.  I still want to know which part since I'm curious to see what people like or not.
<br />
<br />The idea came out of nowhere and I wrote the notes in FT.  There was the first part (from beginning), then the second part idea came out at the same time but doesn't fit much.  I tried many "instruments" but if I do with echo and vibrato it sound even worse <img src="./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" />
<br />
<br />Maybe I should try to learn more music and improve that skill someday then. I like music but... just it takes too much time when you cannot read music!  I just press keyboards notes until I find the right sounds... Quite a long process. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_redface.gif" alt=":oops:" title="Embarassed" />
<br />
<br />Here's the version with changed pitch and a little bit faster <a href="http://www14.ocn.ne.jp/~banshaku/misc/new-test4.zip" class="postlink">here</a>.  I like both version but have a thing for the faster once since it feel more action for a game somehow because of the speed. That's the feeling I get from hearing it. I don't know if I'm the only one to base comment on feelings.. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />
