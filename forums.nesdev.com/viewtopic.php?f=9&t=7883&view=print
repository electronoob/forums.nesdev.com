<br />But I don't know how to adjust the iNes header. I have just these information :
<br />
<br />This is a pirate 7 in 1 cartridge based on MMC3. All of its including games are MMC3 (TLROM) :
<br />Captain America and The Avengers (TLROM, Mapper 4 - PRG-ROM:128k - CHR-ROM:128k)
<br />Contra Force (TLROM, Mapper 4 - PRG-ROM:128k - CHR-ROM:128k)
<br />Monster In My Pocket (TLROM, Mapper 4 - PRG-ROM:128k - CHR-ROM:128k)
<br />RoboCop (TL1ROM, Mapper 4 - PRG-ROM:128k - CHR-ROM:128k)
<br />Somari (Unl) (TLROM, Mapper 4 - PRG-ROM:256k - CHR-ROM:256k)
<br />Super Spy Hunter (TLROM, Mapper 4 - PRG-ROM:128k - CHR-ROM:128k)
<br />Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles - Tournament Fighters (TLROM, Mapper 4 - PRG-ROM:128k - CHR-ROM:128k)
<br />
<br />PRG Size is 1MB (1,048,576 bytes)
<br />CHR Size is 1MB (1,048,576 bytes)
<br />
<br />Please help me adjust the the header.

<br />
<br />BTW look in the documents here and you should be able to find all the other file header info you need.  
<br />
<br />Even if you find and assign the proper mapper (not MMC3 #4)  I'm not sure if you're planning on playing this game on a emulator but you may have problems finding an emu that supports.  Once again the thing you need to find out is if there has been a mapper number assigned to this or similar enough multi carts.
<br />
<br />If it's common enough of a mapper you may not have any of these issues though.
<br />
<br />How'd you end up dumping it?  That looks like a pretty interesting dumper you've got there...

<br />
<br />Actually it is not a dumper! It is just a regular Willem Programmer :
<br />
<br /><a href="http://www.mpu51.com/eprom/eprom.html" class="postlink"><img src="http://www.mpu51.com/eprom/image/PCB3B1.jpg" alt="Image" /></a>
<br />
<br />I identified the glop tops pinout which are 27C080 and connect every pin to the corresponding pin on the programmer then regular chip reading progress ... but in this way the cartridge have been screwed up completely!
<br />
<br />At this project I found some theoretical things about AX5202P :
<br />
<br /><img src="http://up.iranblog.com/images/2qunutkkciyl6uc73z0y.png" alt="Image" />
<br />
<br /><img src="http://up.iranblog.com/images/2op0jry4dyx2rbuutemv.jpg" alt="Image" />
<br />
<br />MMC3 glop top pinout is exactly like AX5202P
<br />
<br />Pin 39 (NC) is connected to (A19 PRG + A19 CHR)
<br />
<br />Pin 12 (WRAM CE) is connected to A18 CHR
<br />
<br />Because there is no WRAM, pin 2 (WRAM /CE) and pin 13 (WRAM /WE) are not available at MMC3 glop top.
<br />
<br />These information are just about MMC3 glop top and I have to test them on AX5202P to confirm it but currently I don't have any AT27C080.

<br />
<br />Nobody can tell if this is a bad dump if you're the first one to dump it.
<br />
<br />However, pirate carts often have weird variations of existing mappers (MMC3 in this case) and each pirate carts basically needs it's own iNES mapper number...
<br />Personally I don't consider dumping pirates is any important, because they basically suck compared to the original versions of the game which have all been dumped already.
<br />Even "original" pirate carts, such as the pirate Donkey Kong Country or Final Fantasy VII, sucks really hard.
<br />
<br />Yet I'm still impressed you were able to dump it.

I'm surprised you managed to get a working dump by routing the address line from the edge connector though, I was under the impression that you would have had to hook up the address line before they go through the mapper glop... My idea would have been to isolate the address line by cutting trace and soldering directly to the trace as close as possible to the rom glop top.
<br />
<br />But again, very cool work! Very clever, I like it:)

<br />Anyway, the games appear to be running fine, just with the wrong tiles mapped in. Maybe this mapper is slightly different from mapper 52 and the bits that select the CHR bank act a little differently, or you swapped wires when dumping the CHR and some pages ended up in the wrong place?

<br />I would try finding the code that maps in the selected game and change the bits of the written value that select CHR pages, to see if it's possible to find the correct graphics.

<br />
<br />I got curious about this statement. I tried to run a few test comparing individual rom with multicart that were already dumped that had those same game included and all came back negative. Tested on about 4 or 5 different game and multicart dump. I even took a similar dump that had only 3 game on it (Chip 'N Dale, Robocop and TMNT 3) and compare test came up negative with only a few dummy data being matched.
<br />
<br />Edit: Continued trying and started coming up with match too, I guess it really depend on each multicart and how they were made.
<br />
<br />If I understand correctly you have dumped this multicart in the hope of hacking it to replace the included game with Kunio Kun game translated to Farsi as those game use the same mapper? I wonder how you're gonna be able to inject the new rom in it but after reading a few of your post, something tell me you're gonna manage to do it even if it take you a year <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />
