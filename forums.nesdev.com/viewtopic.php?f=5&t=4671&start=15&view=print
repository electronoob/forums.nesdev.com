<br />
<br />He should, then.  The forum is pretty open and free, and it seems that more than a few people (with the right initiative) thrived here, regardless of past programming experience.  6502 asm is also the first language I learned.
<br />
<br />Because of privacy laws, for anyone claiming to be under 13 when they register, it doesn't active the account right away.  I, being the admin, and supposed to keep a parental consent signature on file.  I'd do that, send me a private message if needed.  But like when registering anywhere on the net, there's really nothing to stop anyone from claiming whatever they want.

As long as you act professional, then no one needs to know and everything will seem as if you are "of age". Or you could register an account, and allow him to use it. That way it wouldn't really be lying... sort of... in a way...

When I was 9 internet was just about to become slightly popular and it was expensive so I didn't use it so it's hard to realize. But definitely someone who is 9 years old would probably not be able to developp games on his own, but who knowns ?

<br />But you need a credit cart to buy stuff and you can't have one until you're 20 I guess. And also eBay is german only in my country although about 1/3 of the country speak french, and I have trouble understanding german language.

<br />And tepples is annoying when he assumes his bland tetris copy is the best game ever and that everyone in the world is a hardcore fan of it, but aside of that he's not too annoying.

<br />Tepples just takes things seriously, goes the mile when examining them, and doesn't ruin it with inappropriate and unproductive injections of his opinion everywhere.
