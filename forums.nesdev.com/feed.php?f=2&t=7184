I wouldn't trust me on this, since I'm not much of a hardware guy... But yeah, my idea was to use the 74161 (or something with more bits if 4 aren't enough) to enable and disable the various chips, as well as controlling the higher address lines to select the different games. I believe that the games can be ordered in a way that minimizes the number of control lines needed.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=95">tokumaru</a> — Mon Feb 14, 2011 11:05 pm</p><hr />

Tokumaru, if you did it your way with register bits being enables for various PRG or CHR chips, how would you wire that? Would you or rather could you, use the 74161 to control the power supply to each chip? Or would you use another signal? Just curious what your idea is for that.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=1726">MottZilla</a> — Mon Feb 14, 2011 8:51 pm</p><hr />

I love how when you guys all put your heads together you come up with some amazing stuff. Now if you could make this a reality and provide an IPS or some sort of loader to put this all together like Mottzilla did with his 11 in 1.

If the WRAM bits can really be used that way, you'd just switch them to the opposite value right before jumping to the address pointed by the reset vector of the game.<br /><br />EDIT: You only have to force the PRG bits to a known state, the menu itself could do the CHR configuration. Does anyone know if the power up state of the WRAM control lines of the MMC3 is consistent? If it is, this mapper can probably be made with only 2 chips (8-bit register + AND/OR), although you'd have to use two PRG-ROM chips, because only the larger games will use A18 from the MMC3.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=95">tokumaru</a> — Fri Jan 28, 2011 4:46 pm</p><hr />

How would you go about constructing this master mapper? I thought of using a register to control the higher addresses and enabling/disabling chips. You'd write to this register by writing to $8000-$FFFF, but one of the MMC3 lines used to control WRAM (not used in any Mega Man game) would instead allow or disallow these writes. An address that doesn't interfere with the MMC3 much would have to be used for these writes, such as $A000 (if the menu is in the first name table, the mirroring can be changed at will).<br /><br />What I'm not sure is how to boot to the menu. The register of the master mapper has to somehow be configured to map the menu in on power up. There's still one WRAM control bit free, so it might be possible to use its power up state to force the register to the value that selects the menu banks (for simplicity, this value could be all 1s or all 0s).<br /><br />Sounds to me like the master mapper can be built with 2 or 3 chips (the register and some AND/OR gates).<br /><br />EDIT: Mapping the register to $6000-$7FFF is a very good idea! But still, how are you going to boot to the menu?<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=95">tokumaru</a> — Fri Jan 28, 2011 4:18 pm</p><hr />
