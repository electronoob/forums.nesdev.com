<br />
<br />I don't think I've seen this in NES games.  Why not?  Or, am I missing the instances where they do?
<br />
<br />I could at least see tile/sprite combinations happening as coarse movement was more acceptable back then.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />NES can't do it with the background because it only has 1 layer.
<br />
<br />But several games do it with sprites.  The most well known of which is Megaman, which uses a different colored sprite for megaman's face.  The portraits in the stage select screen are also often combinations of sprites and the BG in order to get more color usage.
<br />
<br />Just Breed does this for the currently "active" players.  When active, your players are a combination of blue and red colored sprites which makes them look very colorful, but when inactive it drops the red sprites and they have an overall blue tint.
<br />
<br />EDIT:  ninja'd!

<br />
<br />I just fought a boss in Crystalis that used a green palette, with eye sprites on top that used a red palette. May not technically be layered sprites, but it's the same principle.

<br />
<br />SMB2US (but not the original FDS Doki Doki Panic) may have done this with the characters' eyes too.
<br />
<br />The disadvantages with this method are that having overlapping sprites could give more flickers to a game as you can only display 8 sprites each of 8-pixel wide on each line, and that the system only has 4 subpalettes for sprites (and 4 for the background layer; this is in some sense worse in the case of the Mega Drive though), so using more than 1 subpalettes for 1 objects would need the other objects to share colours more often.
