		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I don't know of any specific commercial games that do what I said, I was just listing possible uses of 8KB CHR-RAM bankswitching.<br /><br />In my old Sonic engine I needed to have monitors and rings show up as both sprites and background, and they're animated, but 8x16 sprites fetching from the background side would've broken the scanline counter, so this was a good solution.

I think that's why I had made that assumption.<br /><br />Anyhow, I found a much better use for it while looking at it: when walking around and talking to people, it changes banking at a scanline split, so the field can use different background CHR than the text overlay.<br /><br />With Mesen's debugger you can put the PPU space $0000-1FFF and CHR space $0000-1FFF in two different windows side by side, which is a good way to see at a glance how the banks are used.<br /><br />I dunno what the logic is behind the specific banking patterns (a flat 8k mapping is never used, it's always some weird combination), but probably it was managed automatically be a tool anyway. I think there's probably a bunch of little things you could do this way. It's not like they had much incentive to stick to flat CHR-RAM banking.
