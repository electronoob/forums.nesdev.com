		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Hello everyone!<br />This is my first post.<br /><br />So I've been making a couple of small NES projects lately, using shiru's library with famitone and the CC65 compiler.<br />Recently however I started on a bigger project - I'm making a complete game (I felt I had the skills).<br />Previously I've been satisfied with the NROM128 (16k pgr, 8k chr) - but now I'm feeling greedy and want double the pgr space.<br /><br />My game is pretty much split in two parts (the tavern is one part, it has all the story; and the other part, the dungeon crawling has the actual game).<br />So I thought this would make perfect sense: put all the item data and text data in the first bank,<br />and then switch banks and have the monster data, quest structure and dungeon structure in the second bank.<br /><br />My question is how do I accomplish this? Shiru didn't write much about this subject in his document.<br /><strong>Basically the functionality I want is &quot;put the following constant variables and code in bank 2&quot; and then in the runtime to be able to say &quot;change to bank 2 and run this new gameloop function&quot;.</strong><br /><br />Thanks a lot in beforehand,<br />// Mattias from Sweden<br /><br />PS: I'll gladly put your name in the special thanks of the credits (if you'd like) for any help you can give me. Thanks.

However, you can go up to 32KB without a mapper, so you can double up the ROM as you wanted to, there's just no switching involved at all, all 32KB are accessible linearly at all times, from $8000 to $FFFF (you are probably only using $C000-$FFFF now).

It banks the entire 32k space at once, so it's very simple to use.<br /><br />I can put my music player and all music data in one bank, put all the level data and level decoding in another bank, all the graphics data and CHR decoding/loading in a third bank, all the gameplay code in a fourth bank, etc. Generally you don't want to use any DPCM with this scheme (unless you want to duplicate the DPCM data in every bank), but other than that I find it a really convenient way to divide the banks.

In reality, the size of a bank is defined by the mapper being used: some use 32KB banks, others 16KB and some even 8KB.

(But this would still use something other than the cartridge being required.)

You could also compress your music, and whenever you load a track, you decompress it to WRAM.<br /><br />I dunno, does this count? You technically don't need a mapper to put WRAM on the cart.<br /><br />Now in the actual heyday of the NES, I don't know if this would have any advantage over just simply using a discrete mapper and using a larger ROM chip.<br /><br />Edit: You could also use the FDS! :V

Therefore, the RAM chip would be the only IC on the cart that didn't just directly use a signal that came from the NES, but instead, used a signal generated from circuitry within the cart. I guess that'd make a WRAM circuit qualify as a mapper, even if there aren't any bankswitching capabilities of any kind. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" />

If most banks have the same code and then some have data which is loaded into RAM sometimes, if it can be loaded when rendering is disabled, then it might be possible, because then you can adjust the CHR address.
