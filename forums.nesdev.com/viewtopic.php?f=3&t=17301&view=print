I ask because Android has emulators, but it has the same kernel as GNU/Linux.<br /><br />The App Store model of iOS isn't conducive to emulators unless they're bundled with a ROM, and only a game's publisher can do that. Besides, the flat sheet of glass that is the iPhone's input method isn't necessarily a good substitute for a physical controller in a twitch game.<br /><br />The Super NES isn't fast enough to emulate the NES, though the architectures are similar enough that direct ports of many games are feasible. The <a href="https://forums.nesdev.com/viewtopic.php?f=3&amp;t=13229" class="postlink">upernes</a> tool assists in porting some games. Game Boy Advance is fast enough to emulate many NES games in PocketNES.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Most NES emulators on exotic platforms are ports of existing emulators rather than new original emulators.  Nester was ported to the Dreamcast, FCEU was ported to the Sharp Zaurus, etc.  So if it's a port, you're getting a snapshot of that emulator's status at the time it was ported.<br /><br />The PSX and N64 do have original emulators though.<br /><br />Don't write code just to make it interoperable with ancient inaccurate emulators though.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />If you're using emulators for development, you want as much accuracy as possible. Emulators written for weaker hardware will nearly always sacrifice accuracy in order to achieve better performance, so they make for poor development tools. Always go with the best accuracy and debugging tools, and be sure to try your programs on multiple emulators (and preferably also real hardware) from time to time.

They're tuned for compatibility with the most popular games, not accuracy. <a href="https://wiki.nesdev.com/w/index.php/Accuracy" class="postlink">There's a difference</a>: compatibility is with known ROMs and accuracy is with unknown ROMs.<br /><br />There's also a tradeoff among development speed, runtime speed, and accuracy. Hobbyist-produced emulators in early stages tend to trade off accuracy for development speed to get a wide variety of popular games running. Professionally produced emulators, such as those bundled with &quot;classics&quot; collections, tend to trade off accuracy to get the members of the collection running. Emulators that run on devices with a relatively slow CPU, such as handhelds or somewhat older game consoles, trade off accuracy for execution speed to keep 60 fps. <a href="https://pineight.com/fgc/" class="postlink">You can't have fast, good, and cheap</a>.
