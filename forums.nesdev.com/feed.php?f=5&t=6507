Yeah, FF7 has really good pre-rendered backgrounds, but thankfully the 3D graphics in that game are simple enough where they're still somewhat appealing. That was toward when the PS1 was first coming out, so there wasn't a whole lot of detail on the polygons. But then FF8 came out, and it was a total blur of crap textures, though the CG cutscenes were amazing, and FAR superior to FF7's. That's a different story though, I guess.<br /><br />A similar comparison would be comparing Wild Arms 1 and Wild Arms 2, both on the PS1. Wild Arms 1 had REALLY simple 3D models in the battles, and was 2D outside of the battles. But it was cool, because the characters were all 3D in battle, but it was basically a 3D model of their sprite (Imagine turning the sprites from FF1-6 into 3D models, so they still have the big eyes and no mouths). With those models, you could still tell what was going on, but there wasn't a lot of detail on them, so it was fine that way. When Wild Arms 2 came out, they tried to add a bunch of detail to the in-battle models, and it looked like complete crap, and you couldn't even tell what was going on. Adding so much detail made the graphics crappy, and thus lowered the quality of the experience. At least it did for me.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=138">Celius</a> — Wed Jun 23, 2010 8:56 pm</p><hr />

Yeah I guess you're talking about FF7 which has amazing ground breaking pre-rendered backgrounds with great lightning effects that looks absolutely fantastic and horrible crappy polygon characters that looks really lame - although you eventually get used to it and that doesn't prevent the game to be considered by many as one of the best game ever made.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=38">Bregalad</a> — Wed Jun 23, 2010 7:37 am</p><hr />

I think that games in any platform can look good, even text-only games and Atari 2600 ones. IMO, the presentation of a game impresses when it's polished. That impresses me way more than resolution, colors and whatnot.<br /><br />When I play a game, I love to see well done screen transitions, for example. A smooth fade animation is billions of times better than a flickery transition with partially rendered screens.<br /><br />What I like to see is attention to detail, no matter how much detail the machine is actually capable of showing. As person interested in the technical side of things, I'll always be pleased to see that the programmer made good use of the tools that were given to him.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=95">tokumaru</a> — Mon Jun 21, 2010 3:41 pm</p><hr />

I completely agree. Something amusing occurred to me lately: Namely that nobody ever looked for good graphics until video games. Sports never required graphics, board games never required graphics. I guess in games like Chess you might have a really basic cardboard playboard and plastic pieces with seams on them, or you might have a glass playboard and pieces made out of marble or something fancy---but it is still Chess, and still presents the exact same challenges and fun. I think the recent retro craze in video games has been a collective awakening to this fact: Games don't need great graphics to be fun, and companies are realizing if they devote too may resources to impressing their audience the gameplay may suffer as a result. Unless you're Shigeru Miyamoto (I'm thinking of Twilight Princess in particular, here).<br /><br />On the other hand though, I do agree with the comments made about making a game look slick. I love just LOOKING at Kirby's Adventure. Looking at Super Mario Bros. 1, while not unpleasant, doesn't make the word "beautiful" burst out of me like Kirby does. That said though, I would be happy to see some homebrews with SMB style graphics. I find nostalgia almost as appealing as beauty in many cases.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3735">GradualGames</a> — Mon Jun 21, 2010 9:07 am</p><hr />

Celius, at the time I think SMB1 did look technically and graphically impressive. Particularly since at the time while many games had done some similar things before it, they didn't have the reach that SMB1 got being bundled with so many consoles. <br /><br />I would agree that pushing the limits just means pushing the limits. The limit could be just what people think they are or be related to what the actual hardware limits are. But you don't have to push the limits to make a fun game which should be the top priority.<br /><br />I agree with Drag, the most important thing is to finish your project. Nothing is more impressive than a finished project. A technical demo or buggy incomplete beta is not as impressive as a finished product.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=1726">MottZilla</a> — Sun Jun 20, 2010 11:10 am</p><hr />
