I think the main problem is that in other processors' assembly syntax, a 16-bit operand without parentheses is used to denote a value rather than an address, which is pretty common on the z80 for example, which allows the loading of a register pair with one 16-bit operand.  <br /><br />But on the 6502, using direct addressing is the rule rather than the exception, and there is no mode that uses a 16-bit operand as anything but a direct address (with the exception of the indirect address mode JMP also supports).  So the norm became to treat operands as addresses unless otherwise specified, rather than as values.  Parentheses became useful to denote indirect addressing, and 8-bit operands had to be handled similarly to the 16-bit ones to avoid confusion.  And of course with the obvious addition of using a 8-bit operand as a value, they had to use something to denote that, and...well, the hash mark.<br /><br />Now I consider myself somewhat adaptable, and in fact am quite capable of adjusting to the assembly syntax of other processors.  But I really don't see the point of changing what has already been in place for the 6502 just to make it more congruent with the assembly syntax of other processors.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=119">doppelganger</a> — Tue Mar 16, 2010 5:10 pm</p><hr />

The only characters that I've never seen used in a 65xxx assembler for actual opcode designation are braces (e.g. {}), but that's neither here nor there.<br /><br />The point here that's been partially lost in the chaos is that <strong>there is no</strong> lda (abs),y mode on the 6502.

Really.  :-)<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">tomaitheous wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"><br />Or maybe a better idea would be to just use <em>lda (&lt;label),y</em> as forced ZP indirect indexed?

There is no lda (abs),y on the 6502.  Indirect indexed is ZP only!"  Followed by hours spent trying to figure out if there IS a reason they're forcing the low byte of the label/address (e.g. somewhere else in the code using the high byte).<br /><br />loopy's already signed off on addressing the issue (pun intended), so there's really not much else to discuss as I see it.  Folks should be familiar with whatever assembler it is they're using -- and use listing generation to debug/verify behaviour of code or the assembler itself.  At least that's how we did it in the "old days".<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3">koitsu</a> — Mon Mar 15, 2010 4:09 pm</p><hr />
