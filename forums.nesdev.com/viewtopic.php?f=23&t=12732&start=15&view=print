It took me a few hundred lost hours of tinkering with a homemade 3d printer before I learned to accept this fact..  Even if the printer is awesome enough for sufficiently durable cases the cost is prohibitive especially when molds are already available for these.  Not to mention the fact that 9 out of 10 people consuming cases prefer donors for some crazy reason..<br /><br />I'm aware of 3 NES case molds actively in use plus the one retro zone retired.<br /><br />There's one snes mold out there with the snaps and fake front screws I've used for awhile.  Retro zone doesn't use their pal looking NTSC compatible snes mold much anymore apparently.  But I found a new one recently and have my first batch from them.<br /><br />There are a few versions of genesis and master system available on alibaba.<br /><br />Famicom is far from standardized specifically on the pcb outline.  Ever drive cases have been available although pricey and coming with ever drive branding and memory slots.  I recently found a new source though and am working on a small trial batch of homebrew releases using them.  They're the smaller form factor.<br /><br />Someone in Canada (apesh*tmods IIRC) had a mold for game boy but wasn't interested in selling bare cases when I asked years ago.  Perhaps that's changed now, I heard word of another mold being made available but haven't spent much time figuring out details.  Perhaps it's the same mold..

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Taking me a bit longer than I hoped to overhaul all my board designs and migrate to from discontinued Xilinx CPLDs to Lattice CPLDs which are actually recommended for new designs.  I made life a little challenging for the pcb layout by designing a board layout which is interchangable between NES and Famicom cases.  So once the NES board design layed out, the only thing necessary to complete the famicom version is swap out the cart connector and board outline.  This also simplifies pcb assembly as the same solder stencil can be used for both NES/FC and components are all in identical locations.  Things are moving along though..  Should have the NES production line primarily converted to Lattice by the end of this summer.  At that point the design will be finalized and I can start converting my designs to 60pin.<br /><br />Gameboy is still on my project list along with most popular cartridge consoles/handhelds.  Can't really give an accurate time estimate.. I made a successful gameboy cartridge prototype board 3years ago but haven't touched it since.. :/

By material alone, I calculated it'd be 2-5$ per shell.
