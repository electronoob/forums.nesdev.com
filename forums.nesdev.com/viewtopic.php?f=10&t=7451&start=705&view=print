At address $002D you used the <strong>.dsb</strong> statement, which reserves the specified amount of bytes, meaning you reserved one byte at that location. If your program doesn't store anything there, that memory position will remain undefined (RAM contains unpredictable values on power up). Emulators usually initialize the RAM to $00, $FF, or a mix of both, but on actual hardware the contents are unpredictable.<br /><br />Now, it seems you are trying to initialize variables in RAM with .db statements. That doesn't work. Assemblers generate ROM code, and ROM files don't contain any RAM information, so you can't possibly ask for the assembler to initialize RAM values. This code:<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">atttablerownums: .db $00, $20, $40, $60, $80, $a0, $c0, $e0</div><br />...will reserve 8 bytes from $002F to $0036, but it will not initialize the values to the ones you specified. To initialize the memory to those values you'll have to manually LDA + STA the values there, the assembler just can't do it.<br /><br />You'd need something like this to initialize that table like you want:<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">&nbsp; &nbsp;;copy table from ROM to RAM<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;ldx #7<br />-&nbsp; &nbsp;lda table, x<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;sta atttablerownums, x<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;dex<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;bpl -<br /><br />;table somewhere in ROM<br />table: .db $00, $20, $40, $60, $80, $a0, $c0, $e0</div><br />And in RAM you'll just have:<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">;reserve 8 bytes for the table<br />atttablerownums .dsb 8</div>
