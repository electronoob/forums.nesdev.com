<br />I if there is a need for something proprietary then fine.  But having that requirement to view a web page or turn on my computer is just plain wrong.

<br />them's fightin' words!!  lol.. PHP doesn't have the best debugging system but it can be set to throw off all sorts of warnings.  I always develop in strict mode so that all warning and errors are shown

<br />
<br />Actionscript though has it's own crazy set of quirks.
<br />The Assignment (=) operator either copies something if it's a 'small' type (boolean, number, string), or creates a reference if it's a 'big' type (array, object, movie clip, etc).  This can have unintended consequences, as things from one instance of an object get modified when the coder thought he was making a copy.  Especially nasty is when you use Flash's form of data saving, Shared Objects.  If you try to use operator= to assign an array to a member of a Shared Object, you will successfully save the object, but the object will autosave any changes made after that.  I've seen a flash game let you buy stuff with gold, then you reload the game, and your gold total doesn't go down, but it counts as you having bought the thing.

<br />
<br />Lua is the same way, afaik, although the only one = refrences instead of copies is a table, iirc.
<br />
<br />And it's trivial to clone tables if you must have a copy, just tedious.

<br />Exactly what I meant... I had to build the back end of a dashboard for a web analytic solution and you don't know how many time I was cursing with that thing <img src="./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" /> And the debugger for AS2... You cannot call that a debugger. The other company that helped us (which had experience with AS2, me I didn't), they were never using the debugger at all because it suck so much. And if you have to code in ActionScript, the CS3 editor sucks too.  You should use the free one, Flash develop.  It will save you a lot of time and headache.
<br />
<br />Still.. I'm more than happy to do some C# instead of that AS crap. The editor and debugger are 1000000x time better.

<br />Java does the same thing, and so does Python. To make a copy, you <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clone_%28Java_method%29" class="postlink">clone()</a> the object in Java, or you can use a copy constructor or the <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/copy.html" class="postlink">copy module</a> in Python.

<br />
<br />I missed that comment and will add to it. What you're talking about is about value types (small type) or reference type (big type).  A Reference type when using the = sign does only a shallow copy (i.e. only the reference is copied). This is common in most high level programming languages (java like tepple said, c# etc).  In those case you have to make a way to to do a deep copy, not just the references.  In action script, when you have this case you have to put on your object your own method to clone/deep copy it.
