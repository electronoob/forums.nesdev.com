		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />If you're willing a spend a small premium, you can get premade buck converter modules—sometimes even the same size as a 7805. <a href="http://www.adafruit.com/category/44_139" class="postlink">Adafruit</a> has a few. <a href="http://www.digikey.com/product-search/en?FV=fff40042%2Cfff800df%2C2dc1a7e%2C17d4003e&amp;k=converter+module&amp;mnonly=0&amp;newproducts=0&amp;ColumnSort=1000011&amp;page=1&amp;stock=1&amp;pbfree=0&amp;rohs=0&amp;quantity=1&amp;ptm=0&amp;fid=0&amp;pageSize=25" class="postlink">Digikey</a> has some too. I don't know which is actually the better price after you include S&amp;H and all other extenuating factors.<br /><br />If you eventually decide to use LiIon cells for their superior <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy_density" class="postlink">energy density</a>, you might prefer to start with a boost converter, and boost the 4.25-3.2V out of a single cell up to 5V instead of bucking 6V+ down to 5. Or boost 4.5V from three D cells or whatever; D cells are behemoths with all the good and ill that entails.<br /><br />But before you spend money on that, it'd be good to figure out why it's turning off. Does it turn off if you put it back on the bench supply? Does it respond to the reset button? The extra watt of power has to be being used <em>somewhere</em>, and it's almost certainly going to be as heat—maybe the PCB is hot somewhere? <br /><br />Is the 7805 getting hot? (Where did you get it from? It's conceivable a salvaged one might have a damaged overtemp trigger). Are you powering anything else off it? Is current going into the 7805 equal to the current going out? (Or at least, not more than ~10mA more)

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I've been looking at LM2577-based step-up converters <a href="http://www.ebay.com/sch/i.html?LH_BIN=1&amp;_sop=15&amp;_nkw=LM2577" class="postlink">on eBay</a>. About $2 a piece, shipped from China. I also see some <a href="http://www.ebay.com/sch/i.html?LH_BIN=1&amp;_sop=15&amp;_nkw=dc%20step%20up" class="postlink">$1 shipped fixed 5V step-up converters</a> (might not have enough current capacity though). There's another driver version they're using, XL6009, but some have said it's not as good (it runs at a higher switching rate, for one, for smaller caps) and it seems only one or two Chinese manufacturers make it. The spec sheet was also not very complete as compared to the LM2577, made my many major manufacturers and with a complete data sheet. Just some things I've been looking into for cheap that might be useful.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />The 7805 is getting hot. And I took it out of the equation and hooked up the bench supply again and got the same response.<br /><br />When I reset it which at this point even resets the lcd screen it works for a minute again. When I probe the video lines while it is off with my oscilloscope the lines look fine and continue to pulse as if they are displaying file.  I left it on the bench supply for about 20 minutes and could not find any hot spots on the board. <br /><br />I picked up the 7805 from a local electronics shop frequented by ITT tech students and other local pros so the part should be good quality.<br /><br />I have not checked the current going out of the 7805 yet. I will check that tomorrow.<br /><br />I have a lipoly 12volt sitting around that I have been thing ink about using. I did not thing about a step up. I was not sure they could carry enough current. I will look into the 2577 sounds like an interesting option to keep battery size small.

To make sure I'm understanding correctly:<br />After about a minute, the screen goes blank? And when the screen is blank, the PPU is still generating NTSC and the PPU address lines are still toggling? What do the data lines return?<br />But any music playing ... do the notes get stuck? Do the CPU address lines also get stuck?<br /><br />Does the current change depending on whether the game has crashed or not?<br />It vaguely sounds like cartridge connection issues again...<br />Does it always happen at the same point in the game? Does this happen regardless of game? Are the ROMs in the cartridge getting warm? How about the cartridge card edge?

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />You are going to laugh at this.  It turns out the problem was a faulty pot on the video amplifier circuit screwing the video signal up. That explains why all of the data lines continued to operate correctly. Nothing was wrong on the nes side. I got that fixed and now it runs stable.<br /><br />Now to begin work on the audio circuitry.
