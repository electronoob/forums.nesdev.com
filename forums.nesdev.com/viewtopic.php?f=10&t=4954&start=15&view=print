<br />I will apparently have to reorganize some of my code to get this working the way i want, which sucks, but oh well. I guess i know what is wrong and what to do to fix it.

<br />
<br />Like Tepples said, you should not play the music <em>before</em> the PPU writes. I bet your code is spilling outside of Vblank. The primary purpose of the NMI is for PPU updates in natural Vblank. I know that it gets rid of complexity to have it the way it's set up now like Blargg explained, but you'll probably want to reorganize this, simply because the NMI tells you when you are inside of Vblank. My suggestion is to have PPU writing code in the NMI and have a one-write-lock system of some kind. For example, my PPU updating code has an instruction in RAM that does:
<br />
<br />JSR $A432
<br />
<br />And if everything isn't quite ready in terms of PPU updates, all I have to do is change the low byte of the address to point to an RTS. It's important that locking and unlocking the routine can be done with one instruction, because that way it can't be like half updated and interrupted which would cause catastrophe.
<br />
<br />And with a system like mine, there aren't really any "flags" that you have to check, since it's changing an address. So maybe you want to set aside like 4 bytes of RAM and put:
<br />
<br />JSR $xxxx
<br />RTS
<br />
<br />in those 4 bytes, and just JSR to that place in RAM in the beginning of the NMI. And that JSR $xxxx would jump to the PPU updating code. Then say it was at $A432, if you wanted to "lock" it, you could make it point to $A431 where an RTS instruction would be placed.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Heh, Celius did a much better job of showing how much more complex it is to run the code from inside NMI. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />
<br />
<br />Contrast with this:
<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">title_screen:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; jsr wait_nmi<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; jsr update_graphics<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; jsr handle_controller<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; beq title_screen<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; jsr do_time_consuming_setup<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; <br />select_screen:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; jsr wait_nmi<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; jsr update_graphics<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; jsr handle_controller<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; beq select_screen<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; jsr do_time_consuming_setup<br /><br />game_loop:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; jsr wait_nmi<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; jsr update_graphics<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; jsr move_objects<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; jsr handle_controller<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; beq game_loop<br /><br />...<br /><br />wait_nmi:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; lda nmi_count<br />@wait:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; cmp nmi_count<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; beq @wait<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; rts</div>
<br />Nothing to bite you in the ass, since "locking" is handled implicitly, and the current game phase is "encoded" into the program counter. And even once you start doing split-screen effects which require some code in the NMI handler, it can be limited to doing the mid-screen changes, and leave the rest to the non-interrupt code.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />My solution was quite simple actually. I just added another flag called 'SkipNote' then incremented it before the VBlank check. Then added this to my nmi...

<br />
<br />I'll admit it doesn't fix the flaw in my programs design, but it works well enough for what i had in mind.
<br />
<br />EDIT: This would probably be a bigger problem if i had to update the screen a lot, but for what i needed, a few missed notes aren't even noticable.

Also, if you store flags in the high bit of a byte, you don't have to modify A to test it; you can use BIT. This is useful in interrupt handlers so you don't have to save as many registers:

<br />Thanks, that will help clean up some of my code. I didn't know that about the 'A' register.

<br />But if you don't update the music when the VBlank triggers, then that means the music could get updated at different times during the frame, which means that the music could end up sounding out of sync. I guess it's not really noticeable though.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />So a note-on in an NES game might be delayed by 10 milliseconds. Big whoop. If your song's tempo doesn't divide easily into 901.5 BPM (NTSC) or 750 BPM (PAL), the note-ons will be jittered anyway. Or apart from the NES, if you have a live musician, how long might his notes get delayed? Music is <em>supposed</em> to sound slightly out of sync. Drum-machine precision is mostly an affectation of the past three decades.
