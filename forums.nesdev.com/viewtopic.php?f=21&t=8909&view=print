<br />
<br />The set used in LogoNES is donationware which is OK but is suited mostly to making full screen art.
<br />
<br />What character graphic sets have people seen?  What would be the ideal set?

They could be protected under trademark or servicemark, but then only when with specific text. (Pure vector fonts are also not, but the kerning program inside the font is copyrighted). I do not know the status of bitmap fonts in europe, but vector fonts are covered there.
<br />
<br />Also, we just discuessed this in another post- <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://nesdev.com/bbs/viewtopic.php?p=93802#93802">http://nesdev.com/bbs/viewtopi ... 3802#93802</a><!-- m -->
<br />
<br />Note that fonts with single-pixel-wide strokes may have unacceptable color fringing on the NES's NTSC output.

It's called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Text_semigraphics" class="postlink">text semigraphics</a>, and it consists of extensions to ASCII art. I can think of "PETSCII art" (on the Commodore 64), so-called "ANSI art" (really IBM code page 437), "Shift JIS art" (incorporating Chinese characters, Japanese characters, and various geometric characters), and "Unicode art" (using box drawing, block elements, and likewise inherited from CP437 and other old standards).
<br />
<br />As for single-wide strokes, I don't see a problem with them in <a href="http://pineight.com/mw/index.php?title=File:Action_53_menu_on_SDTV.jpg" class="postlink">one of my projects</a>, at least when only grays are involved ($0F $00 $10 $20).

PET, VIC20, C64, C128, CBM2 machines (including regional variants and system-specific differences). The linked site supplies the fonts as TTF, which have been held to be copyrightable in the US, but the actual bitmap images are not. The fonts are also displayed as bitmaps which if nothing else could be re-pixeled (a few of them toward the right hand of each example image seem to be slightly blurred horizontally so not feasible to just copy/paste).
<br />
<br />Especially with the PET/VIC20 vs the C64/128, there are a few characters that became ambiguous with the shift to two-pixel-wide charsets.

<br />
<br />I remember reading about how the original designer of CP437 threw in card suits because someone mentioned that the computer should be able to play simple card games, and things like that.
<br />
<br />The smiley faces were useful for roguelikes and derivatives, like ZZT, because it could represent the player. Various other symbols served other purposes, like the male symbol representing bombs, female symbols representing keys, and other things like that. Most of the greek symbols at the bottom row served as enemies, and they're pretty distinct looking too.
<br />
<br />I think this'd be a good place to start. You probably don't need as many box-drawing characters though, so you could replace them with other things, such as chess pieces. Same with the greek symbols and the multitudes of accented letters.
<br />
<br />Keep in mind, people had very good imaginations back then, if an entire character set of accented letters and greek symbols could be used for gaming objects. However, if your character set is <em>focused</em> on gaming (instead of it just being a bonus), then I'd take into account several popular genres.
<br />
<br />Namely, I'd think of Space Invaders, Gradius (and any other one-way-scrolling shmup), Lode Runner / Donkey Kong, and Roguelikes. So, that'd probably be a ship (optionally additional ship characters for facing in more than one direction), some kind of humanoid (so maybe a smiley, or a figure), and a set of "invaders" that could continually be reused in other games to provide a varied amount of enemies (or just "actors" in general). You'd need some collectibles and effects, so coins, jewels, rings, keys, bombs, explosions, bullets, things like that.
<br />
<br />In addition, you'd need your standard ASCII set, box drawing, arrows, and maybe tiles dedicated to semigraphics (like in PETSCII), and I don't think it'd be a bad idea to include parlor game pieces, so card suits, chess pieces (which could also double as actors in other games), things like that.

<br />
<br />ZZT, SuperZZT, Kroz, Megazeux, and Insane Maze Game gives a retro feel as to using that Charset, using ANSI Style art and using it to maximum potential,
<br />
<br />Note that Kroz is ZZT's precursor, because the design is based off of ANSI design.
<br />
<br />Megazeux is in C++, and Kroz, ZZT, and SuperZZT were written in Turbo Pascal 7.x, but Megazeux and Kroz are the only games with it's source availible under GPL.
<br />
<br />ZZT and SuperZZT sources are lost in a HDD crash

<br />ZZT is a EPIC (Mega)games game only in DOS, and had it's source erased, maybe you're talking about ''ZZT - VULKAN ALARM'' (Zombie Nation and Tiga)
<br />
<br />Back on Topic: the top half of ASCII standard font format is useful anywhere even on the NES.

Then in YY-CHR copy the whole tileset (Ctrl+A, Ctrl+C), change the graphic format to &quot;2BPP NES&quot;, and paste it back (Ctrl+V).
