		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />An EEPROM/EPROM/PROM/Flash would be far superior to a 74xx138. The amount of discrete logic requried to decode up to 256 different addresses for ANY address on the bus (16bit), would be enormous. And as we're not considering CPLD's or FPGA's, an EPROM as an address decoder would save much board space, at a speed that would surpass any MCU. An EPROM could also do the job of an MBC quite easily, with additional address lines used to select modes of operation. Very Fancy.

So it would let us decode 8 independent and arbitrary groups of addresses ... but since the historical MBCs don't have any regions finer than 4 KiB (other than the Datel one), I don't see how that benefits us? It doesn't help us create a 512-address nybble-wide RAM. <br /><div class="quotetitle">SNgamer wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"> I wanted to use only an AVR for this job<br /></div>Sorry for hijacking your thread. I still think you can do it with an arbitrary AVR and two 74'08s. (Or one, if you only want to emulate games ≤ 256KiB)

I mean, maybe it might be possible, but you're trying to shoehorn together a solution out of hardware that just isn't designed for the job.

Emulating simple logic using a microprocessor is like wall-mounting a laptop to use it as a light switch.

And even if it was a waste of the hardware's capabilities, I mean, other than the time I would use to find out if it was capable of doing the emulation, nothing is lost by this <img src="./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" />

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />... Emulating an MBC on the RPi? Well, you're not going to be running linux on it, that's for sure.<br /><br />Nevermind that the power budget is daft: the DMC/CGB/GBA consumes about one half to one fifth the power the RPi does. Also the RPi isn't 5V tolerant, and the DMG/CGB are only 5V.<br /><br />Assuming that you don't want to add the several AND gates, you'll need to have a loop that can always determine what the CPU is doing, and react within 1 microsecond. This should¹ be doable—after all, the Atari 2600 Harmony Cart emulates a ROM using a 70MHz ARM—but using RPi for it is rather like using a smartphone as a hammer... sure, it might work, but you're as likely to hurt yourself or break something as drive the nail.<br /><br /><br />¹: &quot;should&quot; because the RPi will have some amount of instruction/data caching latency that could screw up your budget. Who knows!

This would be a great VHDL or Verilog learning project, though this can even be done with a graphical schematic capture.
