		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I've just found this txt file:<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">xband trick to dial directly.txt wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">===NOT SURE IF THIS WORKS OR NOT BUT WAS POSTED ON A FORUM===<br />DOESN'T WORK WITHOUT GAME PATCH ON MODEM OR AN XBAND SUPPORTED GAME (WEAPONLORD)<br />As for &quot;Spoofing&quot; the modem into calling someone directly... <br />1&gt; Check your Phone Options (?), and select &quot;Do not wait for dialtone&quot;. <br />2&gt; Leave the dial in number as is. <br />3&gt; Plug your phone line (people still HAVE these things?) into the Xband, if you haven't already. <br />4&gt; Pick up phone, ON THE SAME LINE (pick up a phone line splitter if you have to, they are about $3, or make one yourself, it's only CAT-3), dial your friend. <br />5&gt; Dial your friend's HOME phone number. <br />6&gt; Your friend should select &quot;Wait for Incoming calls&quot; (?) while you are performing step 5. IM or cell phones are great for setting this up. <br />7&gt; After you finish pushing the last digit, tell your Xband to connect and look for players. <br />8&gt; Enjoy (hopefully, I'm doing this from 10 year faded memory). </div><br /><br />Theoretically, that kind of direct call connection should be still working (as it's bypassing the xband server). I have no idea if that trick is supposed to work on SNES version or Genesis version (or both). The batteries in X-band cartridges are reportedly worn out, so any patches in battery backed SRAM are probably lost (though there are a few 8-9 years old SNES xband SRAM dumps, which look as if they <em>might</em> contain old mariokart patches).<br />Anyways, Weaponlord (and maybe also Doom?) should be directly supported, without needing SRAM at all, so this should be still working without problems. Did anybody try that? Or could try?<br /><br />PS. For the modem connection, analog phone line should work, and VoiP should probably work too (you may need to turn off compression though).<br />PPS. Also found some xband source code for Genesis version, which is revealing a lot of details about the Fred chip's I/O ports, and which seem to be more or less identical to the SNES versions I/O ports.<br />PPPS. Would be great if somebody could donate an X-band cartridge for research purposes (they aren't too expensive, but I don't even have that less money to spare).<br />PPPPS. Thanks to mupfelofen for pointing me on the xband source/txt/sram files.<br /><br />EDIT: One possible problem, there appears to be no &quot;Do not wait for dialtone&quot; option in SNES version. Is that an option that exists in Genesis version only?
