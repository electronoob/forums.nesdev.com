I'm sure people would pay for an engine like that.

I'm sure people would pay for an engine like that.</div><br />On the contrary, I'm <strong>sure</strong> that people <em>would not</em> pay for something like that. Besides that, the big game engines of today (Unity, Unreal, ...) are very much reliant on the massive amounts of processing power available in current computers, consoles and smart phones. That's what allows them to be so flexible and easy to pick up. There's simply no way to duplicate that kind of an experience on a limited platform.

I'm considering developing or having developed, a level editor for my game vs. keying in level data by hand. I wanted to check for inspiration but unfortunately I haven't been able to get this to work. I am definitely a noob when it comes to compiling and making and python and so, but I downloaded the deps zip and no go.<br /><br />Okay, I believe I solved it. Command prompt would not execute the script if the parent folder had a space in it. Is this my mistake with a known issue or something with this particular program? I assemble NES apps which reside in my &quot;Documents and Settings&quot; folder through a .bat file which runs in command prompt.<br /><br />Okay, now I must figure out how to use cmake to get an executable file... I think? This is new to me. I'm a little closer though. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />

You have to use the build targets for this because the working directory needs to be correct for Lua support. E.g. for the platformer sample the command is:<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">build-debug start-ngin-sample-platformer<br /></div><br />You can also try changing some of the files (like the sprites, or the maps (requires Tiled)) and re-run the command to see how the build system magically re-imports everything. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" />
