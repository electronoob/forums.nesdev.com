Yeah that really hurts.<br /><br />Nice thing about the CPLDs is you could use them for multiple mappers and their variants.  So you could more safely buy at larger quantities.  I don't really have any plans to use something like this in the near future, hopefully the price and pinout options will be a different story by the time I would ever really want them.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=4832">infiniteneslives</a> — Tue Jun 28, 2011 12:05 am</p><hr />

ax5202 pinout is here, there is no datasheet that I'm aware of:<br /><a href="http://nintendoallstars.w.interia.pl/romlab/pmmc3.htm" class="postlink">http://nintendoallstars.w.interia.pl/romlab/pmmc3.htm</a><br /><br />I wanted to make a board for it originally, but if the defect rate continued from what I sampled, then it's more like a $10 chip, more than a CPLD would cost.  I wondered if I could even make my money back on them at that price, heh.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=10">Memblers</a> — Mon Jun 27, 2011 11:53 pm</p><hr />

Do you know of any data sheets or anything on the AX5202s?  Those and the NOACs are probably the most useful.  Especially for repros on the MMC3 to stop slaughtering games.  Capable enough CLPDs seem too expensive and way too many pins making then overkill...<br /><br />The NOACs would be cool to play around with but you've always got the clones in a finished package.  It would be cool to make your own clone with those NOACs but but not much real use to the DEV community.<br /><br />Thanks for the heads up on the lot of bad chis though.  That would definitely be a bummer if you didn't plan for it.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=4832">infiniteneslives</a> — Mon Jun 27, 2011 11:45 pm</p><hr />

Considering that most Famiclones I'd seen had bad sound (wrong duty cycles), I'd venture a guess that it may be this one.  I have an old clone that has 6527/6528 (not sure if it's those exactly, haven't looked inside it in years and I know it's a PAL console).  That one seemed accurate enough, not that I tested it to a great degree though.  Probably were exact copies of the chips.<br /><br />When I bought those AX5202s, I found them through <a href="http://digchip.com/" class="postlink">http://digchip.com/</a>.  My RFQ got a response from maybe 6 distributors that apparently had it.  In fact, I remember searching on that site and finding places that claimed to even have RP2A03G, 2C02s, about anything.  Doesn't seem like you could just buy those that easily, but I suppose it's not beyond belief.<br /><br />If they'll work with you to make sure you don't get a load of defect chips is what I don't know, the ones I got seemed to be mostly bad but I didn't want to sit there and test them all.<br /><br />I would probably go for some of those UM6561's myself, if they're the real deal.  Even with the messed-up sound, that's pretty damn cool (probably wouldn't be hard to patch games to fix the sound).<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=10">Memblers</a> — Mon Jun 27, 2011 11:22 pm</p><hr />

This is AWESOME that these chips are available.  CPU, PPU, NOAC, MMC3 seriously?!?!  Anyone know of what differences there may be?  I guess the NOAC is a dendy, but I can forgive that with some region work arounds...<br /><br />I WANT some.  I don't know what I'm going to do with them right now but this is great.<br /><br />I almost want to invest in large quantities of these (100's) for safe keeping or future use/distribution.  I'm kind of confused on where to find the stuff on the site though.  Does everything have to be requested via email?  Do they have the UM6527 and UM6528 (CPU and PPU) or do you just know of the part numbers Memblers?<br /><br />I know it doesn't help you much FARID and I'm not sure what the difference may be with the specific FC controllers.

Prices sound good to me.  Definitely let us know how these parts work, I mentioned before I ordered AX5202Ps (about the same price) and a number of them were defective.  Hopefully these are from a better quality batch.  I can take a picture of the marking on the chips for comparison later, if you want.<br /><br />I knew the part number for UM6527 and UM6528 (CPU and PPU), but I didn't know the part number of UM6561 (NES on a chip).  That's great that it's available in QFP.  Not sure how I would get the pinout for it though, without a system that uses it.<br /><br />qbradq: BTW, ax5202p is an MMC3 clone, and UM6582 seems to be is the parallel-serial chip for some Famiclone controllers.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=10">Memblers</a> — Mon Jun 27, 2011 3:23 pm</p><hr />
