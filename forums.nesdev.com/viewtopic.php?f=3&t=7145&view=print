<br />My emulator drops to a scanline-accurate emulation mode in the selection menu because cycle-accurate is too slow.  Ultimately, I'd like to run the cycle-accurate mode throughout.  Still not there today (at 60 fps, at least), but there is some point where software efficiency and hardware speed will allow it.  I can help one of those along.
<br />
<br />Beyond that, there isn't a particular target in mind.  I like the optimization process and am just curious as to how my work compares to others.

<br />
<br />What do you consider to be "cycle-accurate"?  Does that mean that it would simulate explicit reads and writes for each cycle within the instruction, and possibly execute something triggered for each access?  Does that mean merely getting page-crossing timing correct?
<br />
<br />What do you consider to be "hacks"?  Detecting a game and tweaking the timing slightly?  Idle loop skipping?
<br />
<br />Idle loop skipping is some really good stuff, especially when you don't need to emulate the PPU.

<br />
<br />I couldn't agree with this more.  My emulator is getting more and more accurate as the days go by--141 of 163 test roms passing!  At least for me it runs sufficiently fast but I am having problems with others who use Win7 64-bit having sub-par performance.
<br />
<br />The quest for accuracy and performance is most of the fun!

(This is without actually copying the PPU/APU output to the screen/sound card; i.e. just calling my "calc frame" function inside a timed loop.)<br /><br />What areas of your code have you been optimizing?  Find any good tricks? I've been working on speeding up my emulation core over the past month and have made about a 20% improvement.  I still have some more areas I want to look into, but when I'm done I was planning on posting a list of things that happened to boost performance for my particular emulator implementation.  For example, I profiled a lot of games and found that LDA (zero page) was by far the most frequent instruction (accounting for about 16% of all instructions) and added a special case for that particular opcode which sped things up.  Not exactly ground-breaking stuff, but it was helpful to me so maybe it will be helpful for someone else.  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">At least for me it runs sufficiently fast but I am having problems with others who use Win7 64-bit having sub-par performance. </div>
<br />I just bought a new computer with Windows 7 64-bit and was disappointed to see that my emulator ran significantly worse than on a lesser machine running XP.  Very frustrating.  I think it is because I only have GDI and DirectDraw-based renderers, and neither appears to be hardware accelerated in Windows 7.  Hopefully a Direct2D renderer will perform better.

It's good enough to run games like Marble Madness and Rad Racer but it's definitely a step below the most accurate emulators out there now.

<br />That's encouraging to hear that you are getting good performance with Direct3D.  As I understand it Direct2D is just a wrapper on top of Direct3D so it should perform similarly well.
