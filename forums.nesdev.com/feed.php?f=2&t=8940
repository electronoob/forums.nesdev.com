You are right that Nintendo wasted silicon on things that can be done in software.<br /><br />For the sweep unit I disagree, in fact it's useful if your sound engine updates at only 50/60Hz, having the sound sweep with a resolution of 196Hz or 240hz really helps for sound effects, and sometimes even for music.<br />It can also make sound engine's code smaller as you don't have to implement sweep in software.<br /><br />What is completely useless is the length counters and decay envelopes. Both can be done in software easily, and the resolution of 50/60Hz is not really a problem.<br /><br />The worse thing is that 6 years later when Nintendo released the GameBoy with a similar audio hardware in it, they made it impossible to do volume envelope entierely in software without reseting the phase of the square wave, therefore games have to use the hardware envelope. This was really another poor design choice.<br /><br />On the other hand, there is many really good design choices Nintendo made. The controllers were very ergonomic for their time. The tiles, attributes and palette system is very clever and done in a way that is more efficient as for example the C64.<br />And even if the serial interface to communicate between the CPU and PPU via $2007 is confusing when you start programming the NES for the first time, it's in fact better than shared memory like on the C64, where they had to divide the cloth of both teh CPU and the video device to have them interleave access to RAM.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=38">Bregalad</a> — Mon May 28, 2012 1:06 am</p><hr />

In addition to discussing the paradigm behind the PPU's Sprite 0 hit depending on the playfield pixels being solid, some attention has to be paid to the 2A03 audio hardware, most notably the sweep units.<br /><br />If you look at the size of the silicon real-estate that the 2A03 consumes for it's audio unit compared to the 6502 section (thanks, Q), and THEN consider the fact that the sweep unit is only updated at a sluggish 240 times/sec (why not just use 6502 code calculations to update the wavelength register for a channel anyway, instead of using hardware to do this for a slow shift &amp; add calc?), a serious question comes to mind:<br /><br />** Why waste hardware resources on a chip to perform functions that can be efficiently implemented in software, with some thoughtful planning?  (By the MMC5's time, Nintendo knew the sweep hardware was a waste of silicon, albeit some 8 years after the fact.) **<br /><br />That answer has to be because hardware engineers, as innovative as they are, can not foresee how future software predicaments will challenge their idea of how current hardware implementations should be managed, which is at best, always based on at least 1 previous generation of implemented and exercised knowledge.<br /><br />I've personally designed hardware projects that have ended up back at the drawing board, because of software requirements that I did not think of at the time of hardware design, and I doubt that this is an engineering mistake that is unique to a hobbyist or tinkerer.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=5288">digilogistist</a> — Sun May 27, 2012 5:12 pm</p><hr />

Still other than being lazy/copying, I haven't heard any good reason why it shouldn't just be a Sprite Zero Pixel has been drawn flag. I know some emulators change behavior to that for Battletoads to avoid the possibility of a deadlock since the sprite 0 is usually just 1 pixel and under certain conditions without correct timing or ppu behavior you won't get a sprite hit and the game is stuck forever.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=1726">MottZilla</a> — Sun May 27, 2012 11:40 am</p><hr />

It may be a waste of 9 sprites, but ideally, those sprites could be used to display tiles like a power meter, or score digits (even those these sprites will hang down into the active part of the playfield- a small aesthetic price to pay, to get some use out of the rarely-used sprite overflow flag).<br /><br />Very nice, tokumaru  <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /><p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=5288">digilogistist</a> — Sun May 27, 2012 10:37 am</p><hr />

I'm working on a zapper game that uses sprite 0 to determine the object pointed at since at minimum 8 scanlines inbetween them. It's not working, but my solution I decided to go with was to make the background always use solid colors for background. On places where you have to scroll you can always keep a line of solid pixels with good graphic design, although I agree it should have been as soon as a sprite 0 non-zero pixel was hit any background tile.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=4311">3gengames</a> — Sun May 27, 2012 9:08 am</p><hr />

However, I don't want the different dot crawl pattern that results from having both the BG and sprites disabled at the start of the frame, so I mask the sprites with 9 high priority sprites (1 through 9, 0 is free in case I want to use it for a split) using blank patterns.<br /><br />Since those sprites are transparent and have priority over all others, no sprites will be visible up there. The sprite overflow flag, which will be set at the same time every frame, is used for detecting the end of VBlank, so that I can wait for the end of the blanked area and enable background rendering at the correct time.<br /><br />Yeah, it's a bit hacky, but is a practical use of the flag.<br /><br />EDIT: hehe koitsu already mentioned my rant about the usefulness of sprite 0 hits. =)<br /><br />EDIT 2: <em>Big Nose Freaks Out</em> (top right of the blanked area at the bottom) and <em>The Guardian Legend</em> (top left of the status bar) are examples of games that have solid tiles following sprite 0, but that's at the bottom of the screen, most likely after the game logic is complete. Doing that near the middle of the screen wouldn't be so easy, and would probably require a DMC IRQ.

<title type="html"><![CDATA[Sprite Overflow Flag: Useful for practical NES programming?]]></title>

The sprite overflow flag is just completely unusable, because it's not just prone to false negatives, but also false <em>positives</em>. That alone is enough of a reason to not rely on it for anything, not even screen splits.<br /><br />Even without the bug, your sprite routine would need to specifically avoid having more than 8 sprites on a given scanline, because that would trigger your screen split at a time you don't want it to be triggered.<br /><br />And even then, you'd be wasting 8 perfectly good sprites. There are people starving in third world countries, you know. <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" /><br /><br />Yes, it's an unfortunate hardware bug that renders the bit completely useless, but the NES/FC seemed to get along just fine anyway. <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" /><br /><br />I'd highly recommend using sprite 0 for a screen split, anyway.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=21">Drag</a> — Sat May 26, 2012 10:49 pm</p><hr />
