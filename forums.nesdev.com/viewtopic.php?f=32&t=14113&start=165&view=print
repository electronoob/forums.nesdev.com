The Crystalis technique also works with vertical mirroring, but you need to blank a few scanlines to hide the scroll seam.<br /><br />Another solution is seen in The Jungle Book: Instead of skipping the status bar like Crystalis does, it redraws the status bar at a new position when necessary. If you don't have mapper IRQs, this is easier to implement.

I did not design the hardware, or the menu software and haven't spent a significant amount of time analyzing either so I can't say exactly what is or isn't compatible.  I will say, that category 1 is exactly as it shows for the 2014 rules.  I think the reason Tepples said AOROM would be part of the &quot;anything goes&quot; category is because AOROM boards support 128/256 and only 64KB is compatible

Doesn't that exclude it from a 64K discrete category, and AN1ROM would be more correct? Or is the 128KB PRG listing just a maximum, not a mandatory amount? Still not very familiar with the pcb differences.<br /><br />Anyways, I'm hearing that mapper 7 is fine provided the rom is 64K or lower excluding header.

Honestly I'm leaning more towards a Ludum Dare format where each category is judged out of 5 stars, and if for some reason a category does not fit an entry, then it can be N/A and won't be counted towards the full marks for the entry.  I figure this is a good way to even the playing field if someone submits something like a test rom.

Did you look up at the clock, and found it was 5 hours later?<br />Theme – How well an entry suits the theme. Do they perhaps do something creative or unexpected with the theme?<br />Graphics – How good the game looks, or how effective the visual style is. Nice artwork, excellent generated or geometric graphics, charming programmer art, etc.<br />Audio – How good the game sounds, or how effective the sound design is. A catchy soundtrack, suitable sound effects given the look, voice overs, etc.<br />Humor – How amusing a game is. Humorous dialog, funny sounds, or is it so bad it’s good?<br />Mood – Storytelling, emotion, and the vibe you get while playing.<br />Overall – Your overall opinion of the game, in every aspect important to you.<br />Community – Journals, photos, timelapse video.

Something that would net a 5/5 for CatQuest's AI/room compression, or a 5/5 for Battletoad's insane vblank handling (large amount of ppu updates, tons of tricky raster timing).<br /><br />As a newbie I really love to see the crazy tricks people come up with to fit more data/prettier graphics into smaller chips, and I want to see people commended for that in some way. But, as a newbie I'm easily amazed, so not sure if the examples I used are good ones.
