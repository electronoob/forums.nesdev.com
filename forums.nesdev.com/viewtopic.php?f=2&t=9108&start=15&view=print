<br />
<br />He wants an adapter for his <em>stock french NES</em> to read a US game (putting aside software issues with timings).
<br />
<br />You could manufacture for yourself an adapter that plugged into the NES, and had the lockout circuitry on board. Then, on the other end, it had another 72-pin cartridge slot that passes through every other line for the cartridge. This is similar to what Nintendo did with early release first-generation games like Gyromite and Hogan's Alley, where an adapter like I mentioned sits inside the cartridge with a Famicom PCB plugged in. You'd be doing this, but with another NES slot. 
<br />
<br />I hope this helped.

You shouldn't be switching NES's, get a NES just for this project. I don't where you're going to get tons of NES's to play anyway. If you want an adapter, build one out of 2 game genie parts and connect it to the PCB or something. But even then, you'll have to just use a bare NES mobo still, which will need modified. But still, you're going about this wrong if I understand you're planning on swapping out Nintendos often...

<br />
<br />Those are actually VDD (5v)
<br />And VSS (ground)
<br />
<br />GP0 locks the part in U.S. NTSC mode when grounded.  So you'll actually have to leave it floating.  As explained at retrozone, you scan through the different regions by hitting reset.  It should save your last known good region afterwards.

<br />
<br />You could just use the CIC device that was on that original mobo instead of the CIClone.  You'd just have to copy the schematic connections of a cartridge (not the mobo).  I don't have a schematic anywhere at the moment but it's pretty easy to reverse engineer with a multimeter and flash light.
<br />
<br />Nintendo actually put the same chip on both the mobo and carts.  They just grounded one pin (#4) to put it in mobo (lock) mode.  If the pin's floating it's in cartridge (key) mode.  That's why you're able to disable the CIC by clipping pin 4 on the mobo.

<br />If i understand, i just need to solder the CIClone and the ribbon of 36 wire ?
<br />
<br />It will be less painfull i think.
<br />
<br />PS: The NES was already dead, but it was the only way i found to get a real 72 pin (on duckhunt or TMNT there is not the 72)

<br />
<br />Yeah that reproboard would actually be an good solution for you.  All you'd need to do is solder in the CIClone as is because his boards are already wired up for it.
<br />
<br />Keep in mind all the pins are there but not necessarily easily accessed.  The exp pins and such don't get routed anywhere.  But the PCB is only 2 layers so it's pretty easy to trace out where all the signals go while there aren't any ROMs soldered on.
