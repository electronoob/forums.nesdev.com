<br />
<br />My goal is to get any and every homebrew game that I can get permission to use, and make them on a series of multicarts so people can play them or at least mess around with them (if they aren't real fun to play, heheh).
<br />
<br />Here's the specs for the second edition's cart:
<br />16kB (lower 16kB only), or 32kB pages.  Can go either way at this point.  Max PRG size is 256kB.
<br />CHR: 8kB
<br />hard-wired mirroring (probably will be vertical).
<br />
<br />If anyone has any questions, or wants to submit their game or demo for consideration, let me know.

Since DPCM is pretty likely to be used somewhere.  The board I'm making has jumpers to select page size among other things.  NMI though is easy enough to redirect (to a JMP in RAM), just a minor hack that costs 3 cpu cycles.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">I could probably fix up Tetramino again.</div>

<br />
<br />tepples: It doesn't have to be PAL compatible, though that would be a definite plus.  Have you had anyone test it for you on a PAL NES?  If not, I could find someone to do it.  It would be good to have it at least playable and with a music speed adjustment for PAL.  But I'm not gonna ask you to rewrite the game, heheh.  NTSC is alright.  With the first Garage Cart, only a few PAL versions were requested anyways.

<br />That's my worry. It's been tested on a PAL NES and on a PAL Nintendulator. Fail and fail. The screen is blacked out, and it might have something to do with the technique I was using to hide the screen to eke out a little more vblank time.
<br />
<br />EDIT: I found and fixed the problem. In PAL, the whole game logic was completing during vblank time. It turns out I have to wait for sprite 0 in the same way a lot of demos waited for vblank on nesticle or the way one has to wait for vblank on a GBA: first you have to wait for the flag to be clear (bit/bvs) and THEN to be set (bit/bvc).
<br />
<br />While I was at it, I fixed most of the rest of the delays in game to be roughly 5/6 of the corresponding delays in the NTSC version. Please test <a href="http://pics.pineight.com/nes/tetramino_PAL_20051025.nes" class="postlink">Tetramino (PAL) build 20051025</a> on a PAL NES.

<br />
<br />About the sprite 0 hit stuff you mentioned: It's not a bug, it's a feature! By taking advantage of the fact that the sprite 0 hit flag does not get reset until the end of vblank, you can use it to wait for the end of vblank. This is very useful when you want some extended vblank time and have some update code taking a variable number of cycles and some code taking a constant number of cycles. (sprite DMA is an obvious example, and animated tiles are a good candidate as well) Actually, since you can't scroll sprites off the top of the screen without having them disappear abruptly, you'll most likely want to blank the first 8 lines of the screen anyway.
<br />
<br />Of course, for this to work, your sprite 0 hit must never fail or your game will probably lock up. So it's a little like juggling 5 balls, in that getting the pattern started is harder than maintaining it.

<br />That's why I do something like this in Tetramino:
<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">@wait_for_spr0:<br />&nbsp; bit PPUSTATUS<br />&nbsp; lda vblank_nmi&nbsp; ; set to nonzero by the NMI handler<br />&nbsp; bne @got_vblank_first<br />&nbsp; bvc @wait_for_spr0&nbsp; ; luckily, lda doesn't change the overflow flag<br /></div>
<br />where @got_vblank_first updates only those things that can be updated without extending vblank time.
<br />
<br />And about music: I didn't have time to add any, and at this stage in development, anything more complex than the triangle-channel bloops in <em>Lode Runner</em> or the original <em>Bomberman</em> wouldn't fit into the game's primitive sound architecture. If you are willing to tackle an overhaul of the game's sound code (such as to shoehorn in NT2 or something), I'll send you the source code. I think I left page $03 available.
<br />
<br />And as for games that use 16 KB of PRG, you could stick two games' CHR segments below that (if you're using a VRAM cart), or you could put one game in $8000-$9FFF and $C000-$DFBF and the other in $A000-$BFFF and $E000-$FFBF.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />In my opinion, "The Garage Cart Series" should be the premiere format to have your NES game published in.  It would be structured something like a magazine or journal that periodically releases editted collections of games in NES cartridge format, with Memblers as the editor, intro programmer, menu programmer, and publisher.  Obviously sales need to fund cart manufacturing to keep the series self sustaining, but will royalties be paid to the homebrew authors?  Nobody is going to get rich or make a living off of it.  Maybe the homebrew authors could simply be paid by sending them an early numbered cart that there game was published in?  That is how it works for journal publication.
<br />
<br />Anyway, count me in for a second series Garage Cart.  I want to get low numbered cart <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />

<br />Yeah, for sure.  I'll have to know what all stuff will be on the cart before I can really get to that.  But anyone who contributes stuff should be able to get a copy of it at the very least.
