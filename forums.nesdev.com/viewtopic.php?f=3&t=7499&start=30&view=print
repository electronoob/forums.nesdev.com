Hopefully this won't be as big of a problem as I thought it was.</div>
<br />I'm now fairly sure that this isn't a problem in any of the mapper dlls, but rather in the main code, possibly in the LoadNESFile or LoadROMToMem sections of Nestreme.cpp. Also, it's not "all games larger than 128K" that don't work as I said before.... I now believe that it's "all games that have more than 9 pages of prg rom and/or chr rom. Therefore, I'm guessing that the error has something to do with reading the values from the headers of the .nes files and either only reading one decimal digit or not converting from hexadecimal properly.... or something similar. Possibly the variables wNumCHRRomPages and wNumPRGRomPages need to be different types. I'm having a little difficulty figuring this out and would appreciate any help.

<br />Not really sure what you mean by "no default PRG bankswitching system", but I think this error has to do with when all the PRG and CHR Rom is loaded right after opening the .nes file, not anything to do with bankswitching. Also, I just wanted to mention that I changed from 2 16K PRG ROM banks to 4 8K PRG ROM banks and similarly, will be changing to 1K CHR ROM banks when I learn enough about the assembly code. And of course, I <em>should</em> figure this out myself, as I should everything else, because that would be the best way for me to learn. However, this emulator would be developed faster if others helped and some may be able to point out to me some things that I would overlook for potentially a long time.

You can worry about iNES 2.0 later, but that should help you.... just the idea of how to get the right value. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />

<br />It will be hard to gather any interest from the community while your emulator is just buggy and badly outdated. If you wait until its up there with Nintendulator and Nestopia to start implementing the special features you mentioned, that will probably never happen. Since you already have some games working, I suggest you get started on the magical features you promised, and then that might get the attention you want.
<br />
<br />Don't get me wrong, but you just picked a very bad emulator and added very minor things to it. You haven't done much, and frankly, it doesn't look like you know what you're doing, you're pretty lost. It's pretty hard to sparkle any interest from the community when you have nothing really interesting to offer.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I just wanted to say that my emulator project is still alive and to address a few things.
<br /><div class="quotetitle">tokumaru wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">If you wait until its up there with Nintendulator and Nestopia to start implementing the special features you mentioned, that will probably never happen.</div><br />Not entirely sure what you mean here. Are you saying that it will never get to the level of those emulators in the first place or that there won't be any interest in developing it if/when it does? If the latter is the case, I completely disagree; even today, more than a decade after the first NES emulator debuted, new NES emulators are being developed (along with new versions of existing ones) that are always adding new useful features and changing the scope of emulation. I realize that working on features will generate more interest than goals of 100% accuracy or compatibility, since many existing emus already have those goals and some are very near to achieving them, but...<br /><div class="quotetitle">tokumaru wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">Since you already have some games working, I suggest you get started on the magical features you promised, and then that might get the attention you want.</div><br />A major problem with this is that I don't have very many games working. I have no support for mappers 1 or 4 right now, which encompass most of the popular games, and most users will want to be able to use the features and the emu for most of the games they play. If they are unable to, it will drive them away from my emulator and towards another... there's only one chance to make a first impression, and if it isn't good enough, users may never come back to my emulator. In this way, I believe that working on features before some major accuracy and compatibility issues are addressed would lead to the abandonment of this emulator rather than being productive as you believe.<br /><br />Another major problem is that more complete and accurate emulation is needed to even implement some of the features I proposed. One example is the autoplay feature, which will need to "see" colors and shapes on the screen. Right now, my emulator is terrible at games that use vertical scrolling and has many graphics errors in other games as well. So, this leads to even fewer games that can use this feature from a list that is already limited by the small number of mapper dlls written. Another example is surround sound. My emulator currently only supports one sound channel, so it's pretty self-explanatory that more need to be implemented before this feature is any good at all.<br /><div class="quotetitle">tokumaru wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">Don't get me wrong, but you just picked a very bad emulator and added very minor things to it.</div>
<br />I've explained before, but I'll reiterate: understandability of code is the reason I chose NEStreme. Correcting all the flaws will help me understand the workings of the NES better and make me a better programmer. I believe that building up from an understandable code will also make it much easier for other developers to continue my work.
<br />
<br />Finally, I want to inform everyone of the current status of this project. I've made a lot of progress since I started, and I plan to continue working on this as long as I can. As for a public release, there are four major things that need to be done before it can happen:
<br />1. Supporting large games as mentioned in my previous posts
<br />2. Changing from 2 4K CHR ROM banks to 8 1K CHR ROM banks
<br />3. Supporting mapper-controlled nametable mirroring
<br />4. Supporting IRQ timers
<br />I've already made some progress on #1 and #3 and hope to finish all of these soon. I'm still open to any suggestions anyone wants to volunteer. Once these fundamental areas are completed, I will be able to support popular mappers like #s 1, 4, and 7, and will be able to start working on features. Like I explained, it would be almost pointless to work on many of the more interesting features until the basics are taken care of, so if anyone would like to help with this, please contact me. I will continue to post technical details of any areas I'm struggling with as they arise.
