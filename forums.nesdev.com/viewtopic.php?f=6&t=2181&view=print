<br />The list in that thread is incorrectly copied from the Japanese site --- TOSE did the DS port of Kid Icarus, not the original FDS version.
<br />
<br />They seem to have done some good stuff though. Unlike the "Micronics", the ghostwriters that did the (mostly) horrible NES versions of Ikari, Ikari 2, Exed Exes, Athena, 1942, Tiger Heli, Son Son, Kyuukyoku Tiger, Makai-Mura, Kaiketsu Yanchamaru 3, Mottomo Abunai Deka.
<br />
<br />They're not even listed on that Japanese page; I only know their name because Toei was the only company that credited them in "Mottomo Abunai Deka", but their work can be recognized by the low frame rate, sometimes long delays between screens and the characteristic "pause" sound in most of their games.

<br />Those are related to handling CHR RAM inefficiently on UNROM. <em>Ikari Warriors</em> just left rendering turned on and always loaded CHR RAM during vertical blank, providing a big delay that corresponds roughly to the APU RAM filling delay in all Super NES games.

<br />
<br />Micronics was also mentioned on the title of the Snes port of Raiden Trad, which incidently was pretty bad. I dunno what other Snes games they made.
<br />
<br />I actually enjoyed Yanchamaru 3 despite its bugs. It seemed to have had more effort put into it than most of the companies' releases. Maybe Irem was a bit more strict and actually demanded they make a halfway decent product.  :P

<br />Hidemushi, a programmer of the game, left behind a really nasty message for his coworkers.  You need to enter a convoluted secret code 30 minutes after the ending to see it.  Then it plays Karate Kid music, and shows the message.

<br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">    Mmm, that’s a nostalgic song playing. Those were good times. Meanwhile, who the hell are these people with this project? I’m so glad it’s over. You think it’s nothing but good memories? Hell no! Let’s use this space to give out some thanks.<br /><br />    First off, Kaoru Ogura, who ran off with some guy in the middle of the project. Yes, you, you bastard. Don’t show up at the office without showering after having sex 6 times the previous night. Next, Tatsuya Ōhashi. Yes, you, you bastard. Don’t give me your flippant shit — coming in late on the day we ship the ROM like nothing’s amiss. You can give me all the porn you want; I’m not forgetting that one. All that fucking weight you put on. No wonder you paid out 18,000 yen and still got nothing but a kiss out of it. Kenji Takano, Namco debugger. You are a part-timer; don’t dick around with the project planner. And finally, Kiyoharu Gotō, the biggest thorn to my side in this project. Yes, you, you bastard. Once I get a time machine, I’m sending you back to the Edo period. Go do your riddles over there.<br /><br />    Ahh, that’s a load off…wait, no it’s not. Kiyoharu Gotō — yes, you, you bastard. Aaaagh, just disappear already.<br /><br />    Come to think of it, some people were helpful to me, too. Mr. Okada, who took all the good stuff. I know all about your abnormal tendencies. Yamagishi, who swore off soaplands until the project was over. Go ahead, knock yourself out now. Iwata, who joined in midway and gave it all he had. Sorry I yelled at you. Keep hanging in there. Fujimura, Udopyu, you probably had it the worst of all. Thanks. I mean it. Gotō’s the one to hate here. Also, Takayama, Kudō, Suzuki, Makki, Kaneko, Aihara, Sato (the angel of my heart), Iga. Thanks, everyone.<br /><br />    Yoko-G, good work. This game is dedicated to your wife’s birthday.<br /><br />    Kazumushi, I’m sorry I couldn’t come back home much. I love you and always have. Hidemushi</div>
<br />
<br />Kaoru Ogura, one of the few female programmers in the industry, programmed the minigames for Karate Kid.
