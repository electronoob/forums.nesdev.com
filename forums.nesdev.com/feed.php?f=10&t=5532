The code in general is fine.  My only personal comment is that I would separate it in multiple files like data in a specific module, utility functions in one, constants in a specific include file etc.  It just make things easier. The only thing is that it make the compilation/linking "harder" in a way but with a proper makefile this wouldn't be an issue.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3559">Banshaku</a> — Tue Sep 01, 2009 8:33 pm</p><hr />

With the small amount of defines I didn't have a problem but with a larger game I definitely should go with setting the # in the code as you suggested.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3601">jstout</a> — Sun Aug 30, 2009 12:29 pm</p><hr />

I'd say this is one of the better, maybe the best NES Pong homebrew I've seen.  The code looks pretty clean to me, you buffered VRAM writes and seem to have done everything appropriately.  I did notice on FCEU at least that the title screen does a little jump when the game is reset, I'd say that's a pretty minor issue that not many people would notice.<br /><br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">.define BALL_XSPEED   $10<br />.define BALL_YSPEED   $11<br />.define BALL_WIDTH   #$04<br />.define BALL_HEIGHT  #$04<br /></div><br /><br />That's one thing I've never seen before in the defines, the use of # for absolute values.  I guess it's a personal preference that I always use the # in the code rather than in the defined value, so that's totally legal and everything, I'd just think that could potentially be confusing down the road if it was used a lot (since it makes it a different opcode, which is a major difference if you ever get into cycle-counting).  I tend to use more lowercase letters for variable names, and all caps for defined absolute values.  But it's pretty clear that you've done the research and know what you're doing, heheh. <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />I'd go so far as to say that the source code structure you used is a rather excellent example for NES newbies to follow.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=10">Memblers</a> — Sun Aug 30, 2009 3:24 am</p><hr />

I'm a known rom editor around some circles and often lurker around here.  I am wanting to learn more on the NES core so I started by writing a simple game of pong (1 or 2 Players).<br /><br />The game and source code:<br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.geocities.com/ffguru2001/pong.zip">http://www.geocities.com/ffguru2001/pong.zip</a><!-- m --><br /><br />Controls: Start Pauses and A starts play<br /><br />I would appreciate any feedback especially with anything in the source code that I'm missing or really screwed up with on the NES.  Thanks in advance.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3601">jstout</a> — Fri Aug 28, 2009 5:02 pm</p><hr />
