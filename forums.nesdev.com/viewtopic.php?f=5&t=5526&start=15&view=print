<br />
<br />And I don't know anything about PDS, exept that Ian Bell author of Elite also used it, you see that in the source code "Tank Demo" he released (see the main Nesdev page). The code is weird and very hard to understand, I'm glad there is WLA-DX honneslty.
<br />
<br />Also it should have been very hard to write timed code or do raster effects with no doccumentation about timing or anything. It doesn't sound like japanese scoolgirls can help this much with utlra-technical stuff.
<br />
<br />And yeah according to Bootgod's <a href="http://bootgod.dyndns.org:7777/search.php?developer_op=%3D%60%40%60&amp;developer=Eurocom&amp;field=2&amp;order=asc" class="postlink">database</a>, 3 games from Eurocom (edit : Jungle book english and german count as 1) were MMC3 and one is MMC1. All of them uses CHR-ROM too.
<br />Did you know there were so much different types of cartridges avaiable for the system back then (especially for the Famicom) ?

<br />
<br />That's true - I've been talking about a lot of "new" things I've discovered with our Tech Director (who programmed Magician and several other NES games), even with just dabbling with my audio code. Lots of stuff that we weren't even aware of back then.

<br />
<br />Only a handful of the more common ones. It was surprising to learn later quite how many different configurations/mappers were available. It always came down to negotiations with the publisher - it was them that had to cough up for the (expensive) cost of goods per cart. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />

<br />That's what I just explained to someone on Slashdot. There are pretty much only five families of commonly used mappers on NES carts:
<br /><ul><li>NROM/CNROM/GNROM </li><li>UNROM/UOROM </li><li>BNROM/ANROM/AOROM </li><li>S*ROM (MMC1) </li><li>T*ROM (MMC3) </li></ul>
<br />Even if you see the CHR ROM and CHR RAM programming models as completely different, that still makes only seven, like the <a href="http://windows7sins.org/" class="postlink">seven deadly sins</a>.
<br />
<br />Heck, most of the unlicensed games used one of these: Hacker/Panesian used CNROM, Color Dreams used a bit-scrambled GNROM, Codemasters used UNROM, and Tengen used CNROM for Tet—èis and MMC3 derivatives for several other games. The RetroZone repro boards cover all these families except MMC3.

<br />I've also heard that in the early days they were expected to basically emulate the computer in their head to debug all their code before running it on the one machine being shared by many people.

<br />I don't know about you guys, but there are times when I'm feeling so lazy that I guess a few combinations of signs/values/whatever and compile to see what works in a particular logic block. Sometimes it's faster than actually doing the math or tracing the code in my head, if the options are limited.

<br />Yeah usually I just try stuff and see what happens in FCEUX. If it would take hours to compile, never I could do this. And when doing raster effect, I add and remove a few cycles and try different things. If It'd take hours to compile, again I don't know what I'd do.

<br />Good luck with that <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />
<br />
<br />The cost of goods for carts was horrendously expensive (compared to publishing a disc-based media) so if one cart costs a couple of dollars more to produce, any publisher is going to want you to go with the cheaper one, if possible.
<br />
<br />Also, given that the most common business model was based on an advance against royalties, the cheaper the cost of goods meant that as a developer it was easier (in theory) to negotiate a smaller guaranteed sales figure and (in theory) you got to pay off the advance quicker (I'm being simplistic obviously) meaning you were into royalty earning territory sooner.

<br />Oh was it really "horrendously" expensive ? It would be awesome to have a price list or something to give us an idea.
<br />It would be great to know which sacrifice it was to add RAM+Battery, CHR-RAM, a better mapper or anything in the cart.
<br />Magician has RAM+Battery so you should know that a little.

<br />Because they wanted to use a scanline counter or SMB3/Klax/Sunsoft style DPCM switching along with PRG RAM. All boards with CHR RAM, PRG RAM, and MMC3 are Famicom-only. If you can give up the scanline counter and DPCM switching, you can get NES-SNROM, and if you also give up PRG RAM, you can get AOROM.
<br />
<br />I'd imagine that the CHR RAM boards might have been cheaper because there wasn't a mask setup cost for the CHR ROM; 6264 SRAM was a common off-the-shelf part that could be used across all such titles. Was this the case?

<br />This is complete nonsense. I'm just saying I don't see why so few developper used CHR-RAM late in NES life when it gets many benefits so I ask why. A great minority of MMC1 games used CHR-RAM, and only a handful of MMC3 games ever did. DPCM has nothing to do with this.

<br />CHR-RAM games are much more static.

<br />That's what I reckon.
