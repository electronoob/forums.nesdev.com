		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Thank you for your valuable input, KungFuFurby, I got it all to work â€“ stereo sound, only one copy of the sound driver in ROM, and no more random freezes when loading a song. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /> <br /><br /><img src="http://manuloewe.de/snestuff/projects/furryrpg_build_00198.png" alt="Image" /><br /><br /><strong>Download:</strong><br /><a href="http://manuloewe.de/snestuff/projects/furryrpg_build_00198.7z" class="postlink">http://manuloewe.de/snestuff/projects/furryrpg_build_00198.7z</a><br /><br />BTW KungFuFurby, is there any &quot;recommended&quot; way for loading and playing a song? Because I noticed that unless I issue another SCMD_INITIALIZE to the sound driver after feeding new data to it, it won't play the song correctly (if at all).<br /><br />Here's how I'm doing it in this build (in pseudo code):<br /><br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">jsl music_stop<br /><br />issue SCMD_LOAD command<br />feed 6 bytes (pointer data)<br /><br />issue SCMD_LOAD command<br />feed sample pack data<br /><br />issue SCMD_LOAD command<br />feed notes data<br /><br />issue SCMD_INITIALIZE command&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;; this is crucial<br />issue SCMD_STEREO command<br />set volume<br />issue SCMD_MUSIC_PLAY command<br /></div><br /><br />BTW, to track down what caused the freezing in the previous builds, I traced the song loading using Geiger's debugger and noticed that an NMI occurred during a <tt style="margin-left: 2px; margin-right: 2px; padding:3px; background-color: #3355aa; color: white;">- lda $2140 | beq -</tt> loop. Turns out that NMI and IRQ were not disabled in the spc_command_asm subroutine (but only in spc_load_data). So thankfully, this was an easy fix. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />That initialize command is required each time you change the pointer to either the ADSR table or the SFX (you currently don't use SFX). Otherwise, the main thing that seems to be going wrong in your playback is related to wrong ADSR envelopes. Since changing sample packs changes the ADSR and SFX pointers, that's a required command.<br /><br />The initialize command messes with the stereo option by zeroing it out, thus also making the Stereo command required. If there's an option to make the sound mono, you can take advantage of this situation by simply checking for stereo being activated in the game and simply not use this command if the sound is set to mono.<br /><br />If you use matching sample packs (and ADSR/SFX tables, too), then both commands are not required when switching songs (Stereo only needs to be called once in this case, since that's when the entire code is loaded in the first place).<br /><br />Either that, or instead of sending those three pointers to $0208 and then calling those two commands above, you can instead send two of them to direct page using the load command. This takes three loading commands instead of one (since now they're two bytes each and not bunched up together), and you have to send the pointers to $0004 (ADSR table pointer), $0014 (SFX pointer), and $020C. The last one is $020C because the play music command automatically reads from that memory location instead of direct page (and sending it to its direct page location will mean it gets overwritten anyways).<br /><br />Be careful, though: you'll still have to load the same set to $0208 if you ever have to call the initialize command again.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Hey, KungFuFurby, thanks! Now that I got it working though (and my song loading routine seems complete), I think I'll stick with sending the pointers to $208. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /> <br /><br />@tepples, the full title of the song is, &quot;Three Buskers and One Buffoon.&quot; It's said buffoon is playing the flute. Note however that he's actually a virtuoso musician, and positively annoyed by the buskers' rather unsophisticated tune ... which, all in all, will result in a funny little cutscene. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_lol.gif" alt=":lol:" title="Laughing" /><br /><br />BTW, I've updated the song, the buffoon is now a lot more gleeful towards the end. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" /> (Yes, the flute being totally off-center, and staying there, is intentional.) Also, there is another new track, also intended for a cutscene/flashback/whatever. Be sure to listen to it in full length (~5:15 min.). <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br /><img src="http://manuloewe.de/snestuff/projects/furryrpg_build_00199.png" alt="Image" /><br /><br /><strong>Download:</strong><br /><a href="http://manuloewe.de/snestuff/projects/furryrpg_build_00199.7z" class="postlink">http://manuloewe.de/snestuff/projects/furryrpg_build_00199.7z</a>
