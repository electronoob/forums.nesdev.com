						<div class="postbody">Losing the sarcasm ...<br /><br />I get that many SNES coders are still rocking their copiers. I'm not saying you have to get rid of them. But you have to realize you're a minority. I have an old Win9x box that I use for older Falcom games. When the RAM died, I had to go out of my way to find SDRAM for it. My GDSF7 has a parallel port, my comm cable uses serial, and yet my modern computers don't have serial/parallel ports, or even floppy connectors. If you want to fight change for 20+ years, expect to be inconvenienced. Don't expect the right to inconvenience everyone else for your benefit.<br /><br />Most people now have flash carts for the SNES, where you can put 100% of your games on a single SD stick and load them in two seconds. And they're mostly cheaper than copiers were, and far more readily available and still made. And smaller, and don't need another power brick, and they don't need copier headers because the designers weren't lazy, and some can even run DSP-{1-4}, ST010, Cx4, etc.<br /><br />Copier headers are hurting -everyone-. Many ROM hacking tools only work with headers (Lunar Magic), many tools work only without headers (mosaic), some emulators auto-remove copier headers (Geiger's Snes9X debugger) or don't support loading them at all (bsnes) or try and parse them and will fail to play the game if they are malformed (Super Sleuth), some tools auto-add copier headers (Lunar Magic), many ROM hackers make IPS patches against headered ROMs, and many do not. Every patch release on RHDN deals with patching errors due to this. End users don't know how to add and remove these. Sets like GoodSNES are inconsistent where half the ROMs have headers, and half do not. Groups like No-Intro and Zapatabase remove headers entirey. Groups like NSRT subvert the copier header by creating ZSNES-specific emulator headers. The images distributed have copier headers in 20+ differing and incompatible formats. Later SNES copiers support 5+ formats, but never all of them. Many, many, many copiers won't work with just a copier header, anyway: they expect interleaved images. No emulator supports widescale interleaving of image data. Floppy disks are limited to 1.44MB, so you can't play 2MB games without doing work on your end anyway. You can't rely on the CRC32 of a file inside a ZIP to identify a game, file scanning tools can't detect duplicates because you might have the same game in two copier formats, sha256sum/md5sum/etc tools are useless. Everything has to be aware of copier headers. Emulators have to do odd math to try and detect internal headers now not just at $7fc0, $ffc0, $40ffc0; but also at $81c0, $101c0, $4101c0. You can't even do filesize&amp;0x7fff==512 due to older homebrew that doesn't pad the ROMs out. ROM hackers that use hex editing tools have to manually add and subtract 512 in their heads or with a calculator constantly. And on and on ... I have had to deal with ALL of this. Literally.<br /><br />I've even made this easy. A simple tool will purge all headers in two clicks. My cross assembler easily supports an ifdef statement to include a copier header. That's how I used to test my own stuff while still running it in my emulator. bass -DHEADER -o a:/test.smc test.asm &amp;&amp; bass -o test.sfc test.asm. Now all you need is a batch file to drag your games onto to play them. The same work you'd have to do -anyway- for the 80% of your games that are &gt;=12mbit and/or HiROM.<br /><br />I don't know why so many highly intelligent individuals are so hellbent against any change at all. I'm not out to be the Grinch who Stole Copier Headers. I'm really trying to help make it easier for everyone, but I have to constantly be fought tooth and nail. I wish it were just the usual nobodies with no experience or knowledge complaining. That wouldn't bother me nearly as much. But you should know all of the above very well. Having such highly regarded individuals as yourself oppose this is exactly why we can't get the traction to make real progress.</div>

I forget whatever reason there was for dropping support but it's annoying to waste space like that.</div><br /><br />To reiterate, my issues were that it required a 300+KB dependency on zlib, and infighting with Debian upstream over using system zlib on Linux despite Windows not having a system zlib, having to accept zlib's license, as forgiving as it is, and with losing the association between extension=system, meaning you'd get false-positives so that every .zip shows up as a possible game to load, even though few ZIPs are actually SNES games.<br /><br />You <em>may</em> be in luck there. I wrote a ZIP implementation based on miniZIP that's &lt;10KB in size. It's just a matter of whether or not I can parse the ZIP headers, find the SFC images inside, and show them in a file browser quickly enough without lagging the emulator out.<br /><br />The harder part will be finding ZIP files with .sfc extensions inside and no copier headers. It's a done-deal for No-Intro and Zapatabase sets, at least. NSRT pushes JMA, and GoodSNES pushes SMC+cointoss copier headers.<br /><br />I do want to point out that there are, at best, 4000 SNES games, including all revisions and all countries. That means you are talking about a space difference of ~1GB, which costs approximately 5 cents/mechanical, and 50 cents/SSD. Modern file systems like NTFS can natively compress folders too, in a way that's transparent to the application.<br /><br />The only advantage I see to supporting ZIP is so that people don't have to extract their illegally downloaded ROMs (and noting that some browsers force decompress your archives, like Safari.)</div>

						<div class="postbody">I remember some good arguments against supporting .zip archives:<br /><ul><li>HDD space difference is small compared to sizes of current drives and media people store.</li><li>It's a drain for a developer who doesn't care about archives.</li><li>The OS should do this, not every program.</li></ul><br />My argument for supporting (skipping) ROM headers is that it makes the program handle a very common situation that many people have (having lots of headered ROMs) with zero effort, and the implementation is only a few lines of code (I'm only referring to merely skipping them, not things like interleaving etc.). This is the bread-and-butter of what programs do: take on slight costs that benefit the user many times over and eliminate wasting time on routine tasks.<br /><br />There's a larger picture as well, that of each user's machine being a unique environment within a unique process they use for all the activities they do. With ROMs, they might use lots of tools that need headers, and prefer to use headered ROMs for this purpose. Supporting the user's choice makes sense to me in this case.<br /><br />As for encouraging adoption of headerless ROMs, I'd prefer approaches that give users new options that are preferable to headered ROMs, rather than leaving support limited where it could be added trivially.<br /><br />I guess you tried the approach of having someone else manage the GUI, and add all these things that people want but that don't interest you in the least. I don't know the specifics and the reasons for the way things are done. I take it nobody took you up on making a front-end that satisfies more people. I find this the most compelling argument that there's not much to come back with: nobody wanted to help with the GUI and I personally don't care for headered ROMs, so it doesn't support it.</div>

My arguments against it were above, but most poignantly:<br />* the entire ROM hacking scene won't move on from IPS. 50% of patching fails and requires users to add or remove copier headers and try again.<br />* some tools force you to have headers, some tools force you to not have headers, some forcefully add them, some forcefully remove them.<br />* it's not just two lines of code if you want to support unpadded homebrew ROMs, soft-patching, and file hash verifications.<br /><br />Yes, killing off copier headers is painful. But we -can- do it, and everyone will be better off after it's done. We killed IE6, people said that couldn't be done too.<br />We just need pessimistic leaders in the community to stop acting like it's their Second Amendment right to bear copier headers.<br />Honestly, I know this sounds arrogant, but it really feels like there are many people who are against things <em>solely because</em> I'm involved.<br /><br />I refuse to believe we can't make progress. No-Intro dropped SMC and copier headers, and they're the predominant set. All we need is Snes9X to seal the deal.<br /><br />I've gone out of my way to help. I wrote a launcher/DLL thread injector that forcefully modifies the closed-source Lunar Magic to support headerless ROMs, since its author refuses to. And then jumped through hoops to get around his inane license rules. I even wrote it generically enough that it'll work on any Windows application.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">This is the bread-and-butter of what programs do: take on slight costs that benefit the user many times over and eliminate wasting time on routine tasks.</div><br /><br />That's true, and look at Microsoft. They can't abandon Win32 and its 50,000 undocumented &quot;bugs&quot; because old programs rely on it. Wine is a hopeless project that has been trying to replicate those quirks for decades. Do we want our emulation scenes to be supporting copiers 30 years after the last physical copier has died?<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">I take it nobody took you up on making a front-end that satisfies more people.</div><br /><br />Correct. SSNES/RetroArch was almost there, but then went on to support as many emulators as possible, puts more focus on Snes9X these days, and won't support the formats I am proposing at all. In fact, they've even extended my shader format so that half of them no longer with with my emulator. The features are nice, but extending a spec that isn't yours is not.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">nobody wanted to help with the GUI and I personally don't care for headered ROMs, so it doesn't support it.</div><br /><br />Pretty much. I've said time and time again, it's a personal project. The only reason I keep it going is because I can maintain interest. The only way I can maintain interest is to be true to myself and what I want to see. I'm not looking for popularity (although it's of course nice for furthering goals), integrity matters more. Yet at the same time, I recognize that I can't force everyone to do what I'd like them to. So I'm just going to keep espousing my views when provoked, keep doing what I want with my codebase, and let people do what they want with my open source code.</div>

						<div class="postbody">From the romhacker point of view, I really prefer the header not to be supported and I really don't care about ZIP support. Why?<br /><br /> 1) When reverse-engineering the code in a ROM, I prefer the ASM code to be referred to address $0 in the file, not $200 or whatever: easy to make calculations without calculators (even for LoROM, I did all calculation in my head).<br /><br /> 2) Headers are useless when running on debuggers or emulators so, why preserving them till the end of time? Evolving is inherent to mankind, and when we talk about emulation, it makes sense too.<br /><br /> 3) ZIP files are hard to handle when it comes to romhacking: if the ZIP contains several versions of the same code, you may choose the wrong ROM inside it when you open it from time to time. It's pretty more secure to unzip the required ROM and keep it as the &quot;master source code&quot;.<br /><br /> 4) I don't use bsnes for gaming, I use it for accuracy issues. My laptop even can't run bsnes faster than 35fps, so it's impossible to me playing games. But when it comes to test hombrew code, it is the best emulator, just like running the code on the SNES. From my point of view, bsnes is aimed to developers like me, and I don't need ZIP files or headers or anything else but 100% accuracy.<br /><br />I think byuu's work deserve our admiration since it will be a reference in the future: whenever somebody needs to know how the SNES worked internally, he will check bsnes source code to get the answer.</div>

						<div class="postbody">The below is my viewpoint, and it is shared by multiple peers of mine who have equal &quot;stance&quot; or &quot;seniority&quot; (as if that somehow means something -- it damn well shouldn't!) in the community.<br /><br />The situation is this:<br /><br /><strong>The author</strong> of a SNES emulator doesn't like headers which are intended for copiers (ex. SMC, FIG, split-SMC files, etc.).  I'm going to reiterate this for folks with a slight rephrase: <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">one man</span> who happens to be an emulator author</strong> doesn't like them.  This one individual has some kind of personal vendetta against them, even taking <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/viewtopic.php?f=12&amp;t=9439" class="postlink">jabs at them, as well as other emulator authors</a> in the process (hence my two-birds-one-stone comment).<br /><br />The technical reasons are nil -- <strong>there is absolutely no <span style="text-decoration: underline">technical reason</span> that has been presented so far</strong> that justifies this stance.  The headers can technically (with software) can be ignored.  The files do not need to be changed for the sake of one man's crusade.  This therefore implies that a person who has a copier (SWC DX, etc.) would need to keep two copies of their ROM set around -- one with headers, and one without -- all because of one person.<br /><br />Since there is no technical justification or merit to this, we can only conclude that <strong>the reasons are personal</strong>.  This conclusion is also supported by facts (keep reading).<br /><br />The author himself has stated repeatedly that <strong>he</strong> finds the headers to be difficult to deal with from a software perspective.  Again: <strong>this is not a technical limitation</strong>, but rather a personal one -- the author is annoyed by them, is annoyed by having to deal with them, doesn't like writing the code to deal with them (keep reading, these are not assumptions, they are accurate statements).  The reasons behind why he feels that way don't matter either -- it's his opinion, and he has a right to it (and I fully support his <strong>right</strong> to have an opinion).<br /><br />These reasons are backed by his <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/viewtopic.php?p=101958#p101958" class="postlink">own words</a>, in which every single statement made to justify the removal of these headers involves the use of the word <strong>I</strong>.  As in &quot;me&quot;, as in &quot;it affects me&quot;, as in &quot;it upsets me&quot;.  Him.  Just him.  So we have further proof that this is purely just one person's opinion -- and again, having that opinion is just fine.<br /><br />It's not the opinion that is offensive -- it is the fact that the opinion turns into a crusade.  A mission.  A witch-hunt of sorts.  The opinion becomes something forced upon other people, almost in a political or lobbyist fashion.<br /><br />Phrased less eloquently: &quot;To use my emulator you must modify all of the existing files you have.  I do not care if they are 30 years old and hold nostalgia value.  I do not care if you own hardware copiers that rely on these headers.  I do not care if from a technical standpoint these headers can be ignored, because writing the code that deals with that bothers me.  You will adhere to what my requirements are, even if those requirements (changing all your existing files) will impact other programs (emulators, etc.) or impact your ability to enjoy these on a real console (sending SMC files to a SWC/DX, for example).&quot;<br /><br />Historically the standpoint has been &quot;it's my emulator and I will do what I want&quot; -- which is fine.  The problem becomes when what one person wants mandates everyone else comply with what that person wants as well, especially when <strong>there is absolutely no technical justification for it</strong> (if you've forgotten this fact, re-read my post from the beginning).<br /><br />So from this we can conclude that the author does not like something, therefore he feels everyone else must comply with his lifestyle/choices/issues/demands.  Rather than focus on the negative, let's ask the question: what <strong>does</strong> the individual like?<br /><br />The author appears to enjoy one thing: writing a decent SNES/SFC emulator.  He likes working on the emulation part of the console, he likes getting his hands dirty with regards to that aspect.  He does not enjoy dealing with file formats.  He enjoys emulation.  And that is something he does amazingly well (better than most others out there, hands down, no argument).<br /><br />Thus we can conclude that the author should be doing that: focusing on the emulation part.  Not file formats.  Not going on religious anti-header tirades.  Not arguing or insulting other emulator authors.  Not forcing people to adhere to his standards / his opinions / his likes and dislikes, thus modifying their entire ROM sets to comply with his views.<br /><br />The author has even admitted privately to me (it's excluded from the quote set above) that his libsnes library doesn't even require a file handle nor does it interface with the filesystem at all -- you just hand it pointers to linear pieces of memory and it takes care of the rest.  So on a technical level he has already begun (and continues to work on) the part that he enjoys and does not frustrate him.  This also does not require the rest of the world adhere to his beliefs (i.e. changing all of their ROMs to remove headers).<br /><br />The author has also been adamant in admitting that the &quot;front-end&quot; part (GUI, file format handling, etc.) he would much rather leave in the hands of someone else so he can focus just on what makes him happy.  This statement in itself should make any intelligent reader wonder why the author is on a crusade at all -- there's nothing forcing him to work on the &quot;front-end&quot; part especially when it makes him so miserable.  (This is also justified by the removal of many GUI and visualisation options in bsnes, which is something that peers of mine have complained about for months (years?) -- specifically when those features were removed &quot;just because they were annoying to deal with&quot;).<br /><br />The answer and solution then becomes quite obvious and simple:<br /><br />1. The author should stop the tirade/crusade and stop forcing people to adhere to his demands/standards/opinions while making two-faced comments (quote: &quot;I'm really trying to help make it easier for everyone&quot;),<br />2. The author should focus on his emulation library and emulation bits, as that makes him happy, and it's something he does amazingly well,<br />3. The author should leave the &quot;file parsing&quot; bits (for lack of better term) and &quot;front-end&quot; (GUI, etc.) to someone who isn't bothered so much by the complexities of dealing with them, supporting multiple file formats, etc..<br /><br />Leave the front-end to someone else.  Can't find someone else?  Doesn't matter -- not your problem (honest!).  Focus on what makes you happy and stop forcing everyone (through your emulator) to comply with your beliefs.<br /><br />I won't be responding to this thread past this point.  I've covered every single base and have stated the facts as well as interwoven my own opinions.  But just in case it's not clear: there's no technical merit behind the removal of the headers (requiring everyone to modify their files).  It is purely personal.  And because it's personal, byuu should focus on his library and leave the &quot;messy stuff&quot; that he doesn't like (which is his right/opinion and that's fine!) to someone else.</div>

						<div class="postbody">Why are you acting like this is only byuu's personal stance? byuu has little to do with the fact that headers have fallen out of favor (Hardly anybody listens to him anyway <img src="./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" /> ). I hated headers back in 1996, before byuu was on anybodies radar. I didn't use a copier then and don't use one now. Back then headers were an annoyance for us to work around and only served a purpose for the elite that could afford a copier (Being a poor teenager back then prevented me from getting one). Let me use your own words against you... There is NO <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">technical reason</span></strong> that currently justifies the use of headers from an emulation, rom hacking/translation or preservationists stand point. byuu challenged you to state one and you failed to do so and proceeded to make a long drawn out argument about how it is byuu's personal crusade against headers. <br /> <br />Most of the current ROM preservation community doesn't like headers. People want purity in their ROMS and this has existed BB (Before byuu), evident by cowerings creation of the (!) years ago to signify a &quot;pure&quot; ROM. I obviously appreciate the work of the people back then that used copiers, but I see no reason to continue passing around ROM images with headers on them. I doubt the old timers with copiers are still regularly using them anyways. Everyone that I know with a copier tells me that it is in a closet somewhere collecting dust.<br /><br />It sounds like you are taking this personally... The community has evolved and you are being left behind. Are you basically against evolution/change and want things to remain as they were back in the 90s for no logical reason (other than you might use your copier sometime in the future if you have time to dig it out of the closet <img src="./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" />)?<br /><br />P.S. Nobody is forcing you to update your emulator, just continue to use an older emulator with your aging ROM set <img src="./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" />.</div>

Many of which were technical.<br /><br /><span style="font-size: 85%; line-height: normal"><em>&quot;Copier headers are hurting -everyone-. Many ROM hacking tools only work with headers (Lunar Magic), many tools work only without headers (mosaic), some emulators auto-remove copier headers (Geiger's Snes9X debugger) or don't support loading them at all (bsnes) or try and parse them and will fail to play the game if they are malformed (Super Sleuth), some tools auto-add copier headers (Lunar Magic), many ROM hackers make IPS patches against headered ROMs, and many do not. Every patch release on RHDN deals with patching errors due to this. End users don't know how to add and remove these. Sets like GoodSNES are inconsistent where half the ROMs have headers, and half do not. Groups like No-Intro and Zapatabase remove headers entirey. Groups like NSRT subvert the copier header by creating ZSNES-specific emulator headers. The images distributed have copier headers in 20+ differing and incompatible formats. Later SNES copiers support 5+ formats, but never all of them. Many, many, many copiers won't work with just a copier header, anyway: they expect interleaved images. No emulator supports widescale interleaving of image data. Floppy disks are limited to 1.44MB, so you can't play 2MB games without doing work on your end anyway. You can't rely on the CRC32 of a file inside a ZIP to identify a game, file scanning tools can't detect duplicates because you might have the same game in two copier formats, sha256sum/md5sum/etc tools are useless. Everything has to be aware of copier headers. Emulators have to do odd math to try and detect internal headers now not just at $7fc0, $ffc0, $40ffc0; but also at $81c0, $101c0, $4101c0. You can't even do filesize&amp;0x7fff==512 due to older homebrew that doesn't pad the ROMs out. ROM hackers that use hex editing tools have to manually add and subtract 512 in their heads or with a calculator constantly. And on and on ... I have had to deal with ALL of this.

Without having to make hidden copies of files. It hooks right into the file read/size commands to offset them by 512.

The community has evolved and you are being left behind. Are you basically against evolution/change and want things to remain as they were back in the 90s for no logical reason (other than you might use your copier sometime in the future if you have time to dig it out of the closet <img src="./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" />)?</div><br /><br />What really surprises me is just how amazingly centered it is on the SNES devs (homebrewers, ROM hackers, translators.) Casual gamers don't even care. They run purify, and three seconds later they are gaming. My download count hasn't taken much of a hit at all.<br /><br />But the ROM hackers, holy shit do they ever hate change. Most are still using ZSNES, IPS, xkas v06, copier headers ...<br /><br />In koitsu's case, it's basically the backfire effect:<br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://youarenotsosmart.com/2011/06/10/the-backfire-effect/">http://youarenotsosmart.com/2011/06/10/ ... re-effect/</a><!-- m --><br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">The last time you got into, or sat on the sidelines of, an argument online with someone who thought they knew all there was to know about ... how did it go?<br /><br />Did you teach the other party a valuable lesson? Did they thank you for edifying them on the intricacies of the issue after cursing their heretofore ignorance, doffing their virtual hat as they parted from the keyboard a better person?<br /><br />No, probably not. Most online battles follow a similar pattern, each side launching attacks and pulling evidence from deep inside the web to back up their positions until, out of frustration, one party resorts to an all-out ad hominem nuclear strike. If you are lucky, the comment thread will get derailed in time for you to keep your dignity, or a neighboring commenter will help initiate a text-based dogpile on your opponent.<br /><br />What should be evident from the studies on the backfire effect is you can never win an argument online. When you start to pull out facts and figures, hyperlinks and quotes, you are actually making the opponent feel as though they are even more sure of their position than before you started the debate. As they match your fervor, the same thing happens in your skull. The backfire effect pushes both of you deeper into your original beliefs.&quot;</div><br /><br />(And you know, maybe it's true for me too here. I like to think I am sympathetic to all logical arguments. And I admit there is a pragmatic benefit to just removing the headers where you are able to. I am trying my best to weight it all logically. To make a big column of pros versus cons. So far, I have 2 pros to copier headers (established practice/convenience and in some cases copier users), and 19 cons.)<br /><br />It's a very well understood phenomena. When peoples' beliefs are challenged, they double down. It actually becomes even harder to convince them that they are wrong.<br /><br />koitsu doesn't have a single poster in this thread agreeing with him, and yet he thinks it's just big-bad-byuu out to take away his rights unilaterally.<br /><br />He's a smart guy, though. I just need him to seriously consider my arguments without emotion being brought into this.<br /><br />I'll give you a side story.<br /><br />Long ago, I was really huge on hating Cowering because he was including fan translations that got propagated to ROM sites. I joined the hate bandwagon with every other ROM hacker.<br /><br />But I was wrong. Translating a game without the author's permission is a violation of the Berne Convention (of which the US and many other nations are signatories.) Distributing the original games pre-translation is a violation of copyright *no different* than distributing the fan translation is also a violation of copyright. There is no honor among thieves. To wantonly disregard copyright when it suits you, and then demand it in turn, is the height of hypocrisy.<br /><br />You couldn't convince me I was wrong back then. Eventually though, all the people pointing this out to me stuck in my head. Eventually, I reflected on things, and realized how arrogant I had been. And I reversed my position. Earning me the scorn of the ROM hacking community. IST went apeshit on me over it just recently even.<br /><br />But if I could re-evaluate my deeply held beliefs, I'm confident koitsu and others can do the same.</div>
