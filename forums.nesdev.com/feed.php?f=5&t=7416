Yeah, I took a look at tcc-816. It looks like it could use some work. The Google Code page even says that it's buggy and kinda hacked together. <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_lol.gif" alt=":lol:" title="Laughing" /> I'll see how I feel about compilers once I finish this semester's class and I may see what I can do for a SNES C compiler. I may even see about a C++ compiler since I like object oriented programming. Programming in C/C++ is better as far as level of easiness than straight assembly. The C/C++ compiler would be an extensive project as I'd need to write libraries that access the hardware and reduce the need for direct assembly usage. It would be nice if I could learn SPC assembly too so that I could write libraries that load midi, mod, and other compatible audio formats to the SNES through C programming.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3995">pcmantinker</a> — Mon Jan 24, 2011 1:27 pm</p><hr />

I wouldn't mind something better than the C compiler we have now (tcc-816) <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" /><br />It generates very poor code and has several bugs and shortcomings, but it's more or less abandoned by the author.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=1181">mic_</a> — Mon Jan 24, 2011 2:49 am</p><hr />

I'm attending Louisiana State University. So far, my classwork hasn't been too exciting since I was mainly finishing all my prereqs for my upper level classes. Now that I'm in my upper level classes, I'm pretty interested in what we'll be doing this semester. Last semester, one of my prereqs for compiler construction was a programming languages class. In my programming languages class, we built a Scheme interpreter in either C++ or Java. My project partner and I built ours in Java. Our Scheme interpreter is a basic subset of the Scheme language, but it is extensible by writing the other functions in Scheme using Scheme's environment, or by extending the Java backend.<br /><br />As for my compilers and my MIPS assembly class, I hope that I can get a better understanding of the assembly language. I've dabbled in 6502 and 65816 assembly some before, but I've never really understood the basic concepts of assembly. I tried making a program for the SNES that adds, subtracts, multiplies, and even divides, but I don't think I had the most efficient algorithms. I'll probably understand better after these courses how to better utilize the SNES hardware. The SNES is my favorite console and I've always had a dream to make a simple game for the console. Also, after completion of these courses, if I feel confident enough, I may look into making a C compiler or possibly a Tiger (shouldn't be too difficult since I'd just need to change the target architecture design) compiler for the SNES, provided that I understand the 65816 architecture enough to translate code into compatible assembly and assemble it to binary.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3995">pcmantinker</a> — Mon Jan 24, 2011 12:25 am</p><hr />

Awesome!  I remember the MIPS classes at my university (cs 204 + cs 205 I think).  Back then I wrote my compiler in 'C', but otherwise your description matches mine.  I really enjoyed the class.  I had learned about logic gates, half-adders, full-adders, etc... on my own when I was much younger.  However, this class was the first time that I was formally taught how to do really complicated things with them (full-blown ALU, TLB, L1 cache, etc...).  Our professor <a href="http://web.mst.edu/~ercal/" class="postlink">Fikret Ercal</a> was a blast too (but it looks like he no longer teaches that one).<br /><br />I hope that you get a lot out of this class.  I did.<br /><br />What university are you attending?<br /><br />ps- We sometime verified our work by compiling C code with GCC on the available Irix servers.  They used one of the MIPS, and the gcc on those could target MIPS-R2000 - so we didn't have to build a cross-compiler.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3664">clueless</a> — Mon Jan 24, 2011 12:09 am</p><hr />

So, I've finally started my MIPS assembly class and compilers class this semester. It should be an interesting semester. Since I'm a computer science major, we won't be going into as much details about the hardware as computer engineers/electrical engineers. I'm looking forward to learning about MIPS assembly though. <br /><br />For my compilers class, we get to build a lexer, parser, and assembler for compiling Tiger (language) programs to run on MIPS systems. We're using Java and JLex for the lexical analyzer and parser. The rest of the data structures are going to be built throughout the class.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3995">pcmantinker</a> — Sun Jan 23, 2011 11:50 pm</p><hr />
