Apparently Gold and Silver still support the SGB, Crystal doesn't though (although there are some leftovers from Gold in it).<br /><br />Also Korean versions need a GBC (they need the extra video memory in order to fit hangul), but I doubt this will bother with that version =P<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=4526">Sik</a> — Mon Nov 24, 2014 4:45 pm</p><hr />

Feel free to post your questions as you go.  This group (of great guys!) helped me with several of my projects questions and I'm happy to return the help to others.  Out of curiosity, what is the flash rom size?  Can you post that info?  What chips are you going to use?<br /><br />Maybe you should post what your general game plan is to accomplish your goals.  Whether it fits or not or if we think it's crazy or not  doesn't matter.  This is the path you chose to learn and gaining knowledge is priceless.<br /><br />I knew NOTHING about snes carts, EPROMs, buffers, MUX's, even pull up/down resistors.  I had a very basic understanding of passive parts and electricity but I asked a lot of questions..... Did A LOT of reading and fact finding on the web, banged my head against the wall many times ( it helped!  Lol) and I was able to learn AND accomplish my goals.<br /><br />So good luck and hopefully we can help out.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=5779">Markfrizb</a> — Mon Nov 24, 2014 7:55 am</p><hr />

Your best bet would be to get a double size flash rom and just do a bank switch.  Have both programs in the rom and if it saves, you'll want to double the SRAM and bank switch that too.  Only 2 wires to deal with for a physical switch.    I'm not familiar with the sGB carts and how they function so I may be completely wrong.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=5779">Markfrizb</a> — Sat Nov 22, 2014 6:13 pm</p><hr />

Hey Guys,<br /><br />I have an idea that I want to try to build but I am not sure if it is technically possible. I would appreciate your help and patience. I have seen the projects with EPROM but I do not want to do it that way (yet!).<br /><br />My idea is that I want to put Pokemon Silver and Pokemon Gold and a Super Game Boy into a SNES cartridge (similar to this project <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://imgur.com/a/dOHF8">http://imgur.com/a/dOHF8</a><!-- m -->). I do not think there is enough space for all of it to fit into an SNES cartridge but that is not my main concern.<br /><br />This is the equipment I plan on using:<br />Pokemon Gold and Silver cartridges<br />Super Game Boy<br />Wires<br />Working SNES<br />Quad 2-input Muliplexers<br /><br />The way I wanted to go about this project is the following:<br />-A manual switch will be used to select which game will be loaded (for example, on would be pokemon gold and off would be pokemon silver)<br />-There are 32 pins from each gameboy game that will need to be connected to the super game boy<br />-(I am not sure if this step is feasible so please let me know if there is another way to do it) In order to switch the connections to the super game boy, I want to use a series of multiplexers in conjunction with the switch to switch the connections. The power will be coming from the super game boy.  <br /><br />My main concern is the method in which the connections will switch from one game to another. <br /><br />I look forward to your replies!<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=6784">alanifamily</a> — Sat Nov 22, 2014 10:46 am</p><hr />
