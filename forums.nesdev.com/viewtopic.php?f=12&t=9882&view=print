Recently, I've been trying to code the asm to display a sprite on the screen.<br /><br />I've mostly been going off the walker.asm example in the snes starter kit.<br /><br />Now, I've gotten the sprite to display, but unless I put the palette at 100 bytes after the DMA address; the palette will be weird.<br /><br />In this case, the palette is at 81A000 and that's the address I DMA to CGRAM. But unless I put the palette at 81A100, it won't send the correct palette.<br /><br />This is weird because I did store 0 to the color register, so I thought that meant that the game should use the first palette?<br /><br />You can download the asm file for the sprite routine here:<br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.mediafire.com/download.php?sb9bmmpnozdl1jc">http://www.mediafire.com/download.php?sb9bmmpnozdl1jc</a><!-- m -->

It uses the latter 256 bytes for sprites. But is this is true or just a coindence?<br /><br />Infact yeah, I think that's it. It's because color 128 starts at $100 in cgram and sprites can only use the latter 128 colors.<br /><br />I only found one document clarifying this though...<br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"> The background can use the first 128 colors in BG modes 0,1,2,5,6, and all<br /> 256 colors in BG modes 3,4,7 when not in direct color mode.

There's a lack of asm examples on how to do things and the examples out there, make things too confusing.<br /><br />Even with all the docs, you still mostly have to figure out everything yourself.<br /><br />For instance, I've been trying to understand how simply move a sprite up and searching on google hasn't brung up anything good. I feel as though the only way I can figure it out is to figure out how a commercial snes game does it.
