So, help this piggie place blocks, swing squeaky hammers, push stools, press switches, collect keys, devour carrots, leap, climb, teeter, and tumble his way through 24 dark, dingy, and drab basement doors.<br /><br /><strong>Objectives</strong><br /><ul><li>Collect keys to open doors.</li><li>Consume a carrot before leaving each room.</li></ul><br /><strong>Guinea Pig Controls:</strong><br /><em>Control Grunio Directly</em><br /><blockquote style="margin-left: 1%; padding-left: 1%; border-left: 3px solid #555577;">

With permission from the folks at arhn.eu, we decided the NesDev Competition seemed like the best opportunity for digitally releasing it.<br /><br />We hope you enjoy.<br /><br /><img src="http://files.mteegfx.com/grBlocksTr.png" alt="Image" />

It made for some interesting challenges in puzzle design, as we tried to find a good balance between the number of possible solutions each puzzle has.<br /><br />Anyway, OP updated with download link (of the comp. version) if anyone needs it.

Let me list the most significant ones to me:<br /><br />-Extremely charming graphics and animation anyone should be able to enjoy, young or old.<br />-Moreover, the animation informs the player what Grunio is able to do.<br />-Good use of pastels<br />-Proof that a good idea can make a good game. If this game had just placeholder block graphics (which isn't to say they don't contribute because they most certainly do!), it'd still be able to be fun on its mechanical merits.<br />-Great music, and it's not just because it's a song. It creates an interesting contrast between its action packed, adventurous air, and the existential stipulations of a guinea pig (especially a pet one having a trip through the house). <br />-Personally, i'm not too great at puzzlers, but they're almost always enjoyable. So is this one. So it's great that it has a short password system for someone like me who'd like to do a few levels here and there. <br /><br /><br />Some nitpicks and ideas:<br />-I feel exiting the level should be the players' option. This is trivial in almost all levels, but there was one (#11) where i touched the door and lost my chance going for the carrot permanently for that session. I recognize that introducing such a choice poses the a new problem to the designer: how to make a voluntary level depth-axis exit an intuitive experience on a d-pad in a 2d platformer? So i'm not too convinced of my own nitpick unless there's a good solution on how to do it. <br /><br />-Sort of to mitigate the above &quot;problem&quot; with loss of agency in a few corner cases: How about being able to revisit earlier levels from the level screen? Keep track of what carrots are collected and that might interesting. Also helps against difficulty spikes getting certain carrots. The player doesn't need to feel compelled staying on the level until the carrot is gotten this way. <br /><br />-The cavyvision interface could be a bit more &quot;tolerant&quot; of varying user input methods. For example:<br />--Pressing start (which does nothing at the moment) could confirm and exit, just like A. This helps when playing in an emulator via keyboard especially, but would matter less with a NES pad in hand.<br />--<strong>EDIT: </strong>Or, alternately, and maybe even better, start could access the &quot;restart menu&quot;, even while you're in cavyvision. I find that it is while inside this mode that i figure out if i need to restart or not, most of the time. <br />--Maybe, holding b (which at least i did intuitively) when entering cavyvision could allow the d-pad to two-way select the item. Releasing b and you get to select where to place it. <br /><br /><br />Also... Nov 2017 - Jan 2018?!  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_eek.gif" alt=":shock:" title="Shocked" /> That has got to be the quickest complete-feeling homebrew to this date. How did you manage that?<br /><br /><strong>EDIT2</strong>: It failed to comment on this tiny miny detail when we exchanged tips &amp; tricks last time: The animation for the haulm of the carrot could perhaps benefit if it was delayed a bit more as to be more of a reaction to the movement of the carrot itself. <br /><br />Ie: Carrot is forced upwards - haulm bends in response (not quite simultaneously) to this movement. Carrot is forced to stop. Haulm moves toward an unstrained position; maybe overshooting it. But carrot is dragged downards around this mark, so the haulm is stretched out in consequent response.

Since we didn't have any enemies or other characters during gameplay, I wanted to go a little Prince of Persia with the player animation. Something that'd be enjoyable to watch and would show personality. I'm glad you found it successful.<br /><br />As for colors, we tried a few different visual themes early on. Having a nearly all black protagonist brought with it challenges, especially with the setting (being a basement).<br /><br /><img src="http://files.mteegfx.com/grunio.jpg" alt="Image" /><br /><em>Grunio's particular fur pattern made showing clarity and contrast with the background particularly challenging.</em><br /><br />So, the light color palette came about from necessity. Initially, the blocks had no particular theme. They were just gameplay blocks (maybe bricks, I don't recall). While doing my initial guinea pig research for the project, I noticed a lot of their chew toys are similar to those for birds, very brightly colored, so having colorful blocks became a goal. That, along with the cute player animations, I hoped would make for some interesting contrast with the setting. <br /><br />As for the password system (just 4 numbers), it's carried over from our last project, and is pretty much inspired from Bubble Bobble: a short, simple system that only controls starting point.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">FrankenGraphics wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">-Proof that a good idea can make a good game.

Also, the main music selections were mostly his as well. When he proposed the title screen and main gameplay track, I knew we had something special going, so I'm really glad that contrast is noticed and appreciated. Also, it should go without saying, we're lucky that such high quality music as Shiru's is available for use.<br /><br />Anyway, was finally sitting down to respond to these points, but it's bed time. Will continue responding tomorrow. Thanks again for such detailed feedback.
