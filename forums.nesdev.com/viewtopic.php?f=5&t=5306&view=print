What do you guys think ?

<br />
<br />sinamas has mentioned some other novel approaches, but I don't know if anyone has actually tried them out. The idea is to keep a timestamped log of writes, so the other chip doesn't have to sync up, but it can still get the correct value.
<br />
<br />There's tons of research going on in the virtual machine area, but that stuff is boring to me. Too limited :/

<br />
<br />And before anyone says "well why don't you write one?", I am writing one, but I have severe doubts about my programming skill. At some point, perhaps I should give up and port Nintendulator. I haven't looked its source, but hopefully I can strip it down a lot so that I can have it use GTK and render to a Cairo surface. 
<br />
<br />All I need from an emulator is menus for Open, Close, Run, Pause, Stop, Reset, and key configuration. On windows Xbox 360 controller support would be nice, and on linux user-space drivers for the same controller makes it so specific support isn't even necessary to use them.
<br />
<br />Hopefully I don't fail  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_redface.gif" alt=":oops:" title="Embarassed" /> , and I'll have the same code portable to both x86 Windows and Linux. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />

<br />There's some FCE Ultra stuff in Ubuntu's repository, including what appears to be a Gtk+ based front-end. It's no Nintendulator, but it beats iNES. I use it for basic testing of algorithms when I'm coding on my laptop at someone else's house.

It let's you pick the rom using the file chooser, configure video and (which doesn't seem to function) controllers, and then hit Execute to get that same plain window with no functionality to it (besides the game itself with whatever controls it decided to use). I admit I have not RTFM'd yet, so I could be doing something wrong with the control configuration.
<br />
<br />EDIT: I didn't even think to try the Windows version in Wine. It seems to run perfectly. Woohoo!

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />A very limited, barely functional NES emulator @ 30fps via SNES with an SA-1 co-processor and a ton of BW-RAM <em>may</em> in fact be a possibility. Double-clock the SA-1 if needed. Even audio could be simulated to a small extent by using the S-SMP to simulate parts of it.
<br />
<br />The absolutely major problem would be trying to re-map MMIO registers for the PPU. Best bet would probably be static recompilation of code, replacing MMIO writes with brk / cop #nn interrupts. Timing would be out, you'd have to hope you're running faster than the real thing and the game isn't timing sensitive.
<br />
<br />I would say to over-ride DBR and then use the main CPU to monitor a section of BWRAM and execute any "MMIO writes" it observes, but detecting when the game writes the same value twice would not be possible.

<br />
<br />Static recompilation, that's exactly it.  I figure any non-native writes could be replaced with JSR to the appropriate bit of translation code (or BRK as well).  Also timed code, sprite zero, etc. I believe would be doable pretty easily, by counting SNES scanlines and using that as an index into the buffer of the scroll settings for every scanline.
<br />
<br />Since SNES isn't much faster than NES though, too many updates in one frame could pile up faster than can be handled.
