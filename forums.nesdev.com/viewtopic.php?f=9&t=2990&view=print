Once seems to be connected directly to the MMC5 (while I'm not sure at all), while the other seems to be connected to the audio circuitery block above the CIC, where there is empty slots for plenty resistors and capacities (while none is used). This is valable for all NES-ExROM boards. So it all sounds like Nintendo COULD have used sound if they were making adaptators made, and if they would place some additional componant on a normal ExROM board without applying any modification to it.
<br />However, the MMC5 has 3 (?) audio pins, and I don't have any idea how the audio circuitery is made. Traces are hard to follow.

<br />
<br />Two "squares" (lacking sweep) and a 8-bit PCM, right?
<br />
<br />If one of said wires is grounded, then I'd assume the squares on one line and the PCM on the other, much like the 2A03 itself.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I don't know if both are output, at least one is. I'll trace further detail someday, comparing NES-EKROM and HVC-EKROM (since I've both boards). The famicom cartridges typically just bridge two auio pins together, because one is input from the CPU and the other is output to the audio amplifier. Cutting that bridge would result in no sound played at all, even if the CPU function correctly. So I guess cards with expansion sound have an analog circuitery to mix both sound source together before feeding it to the audio amplifier. Since the audio goes directly to the amplifier in the NES, there is no need to port it to the cartridge, explaininy why the circuitery is different. I guess MMC5 has been developped with both circuit in mind. FC cards works on a modified NES, because they mix their sound with open bus (because FC2NES adapters will probably leave the sound input pin floating), resulting in only expansion sound output in the sound out pin. I guess it's the 'bad way' to do it, because a capacitor or resisor should ground the audio input pin for noise immunity.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I eventually found a multimeter and traced all that stuff down !!
<br />
<br />Pin 55 (EXP 5) of NES boards is connected to the /OE of the WRAM, wich is grounded trough a 15k resistor (R10 on the NES-EKROM board). There is also a big solder pad (test point ?) in the middle of the PCB leading to that trace.
<br />On the famicom HVC-EKROM board, /OE of the WRAM is directly connected to ground.
<br />I guess this was done so that an external circuitery plugged in the NES expension port could force the WRAM to never output data under certain conditions, discarding all reads from it. Why this would be desirable, I'll never known. This also explain why NES-ELROM doesn't have that pin, since there is no WRAM. It's not known if NES-ETROM has this for both RAM chips or only one of them. I can just tell the pin is there from pictures found on the 'net.
<br />
<br />Pin 56 (EXP 6) directly feeds the circuit's audio inside the NES ! Unfortunately, only a device that plug in in the EXP port would actually made it possible to hear. I traced down the circuitery of both NES and Famicom boards :

<br />Note that R9 is lacking on HVC boards, and that R3 and C4 are lacking on NES boards. Nintendo made it so that the naming of component were compatible between NES and HVC boards, wich is kind of cool.
