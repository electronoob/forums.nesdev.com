<br />bcc/bcs does branch in function of the carry, but rol/ror can also get it's value into an other value and that's VERY usefull.
<br />After a AND instruction, the carry won't be affected, so it will stay what it was before. To set the carry to a know state, just use sec/clc.

When something wraps around, is the carry flag affected at all? What flag is affected at a wrap around? I could probably use this to say to increase the high byte! I have to do some thinking...

<br />
<br />That's the exact idea. If you're using INC or DEC you can detect wrapping around by checking the Z flag. $FF + 1 = $00 (Z flag set). If you're using ADC you can just use the carry flag. If it is set, the number wraped around. There is no need for a "BWA". BEQ or BCS (depending on how you're incrementing the number) will work just fine.

<br />
<br />Put another way, BWA already exists, just as BLT (signed branch if less than) and BGE (signed branch if greater than or equal); they're just spelled differently in an assembler (BEQ/BCS, BCC, and BCS).

I changed every clc to an sec, and guess what, the carry flag was never set, according to fceuxd ultra's debugger! why!? I DON'T KNOW! that's really stupid! and if I deleted the clc at the end of the routine, and changed all secs to clc, it would always be set! WHAT'S THE DEAL!? This is causing alot of problems!

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Just doing clc at the end of the reset routine is totally stupid, scince your indefinite loop won't use the carry.
<br />Use clc/sec before an addition/substaction or while exiting of a routine using carry flag as a parameter, when you know that his state won't be modified between the setup of the carry flag and the use of it.
<br />See what I mean :
<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">lda Number1<br />clc<br />adc Number2<br />sta Number1 ;PROPRELY add two values<br /></div><br />will work fine.<br />Versus :<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">clc<br />lda Blahbla<br />sta blahblah<br />and blahblah<br />eor blahblah ;Lots of instruction that doesn't affect the carry flag, so it will remain clear<br />ora blahblah<br />sta blahblah<br />tay<br />lda Blahblah,Y<br />adc Number2&nbsp; ;The carry flag... should be clear here<br />sta Number1<br /></div>
<br />But then, if you modify the code between clc and adc, you may add something modifing the carry flag, and then your adc will go wrong and randomly add 1 more, and you will be angry because you won't found the error.
<br />In some case, like after an ASL where you know that the bit 7 was clear, or typically after a BCS, you can skip the clc before the addition, because you are sure that it's clear, but beware ! If you change your code, you have to don't forget to reconsider that optimization.
<br />The code you posted several topics above looks fine for pointer maths, so I really can't say what's wrong.

<br />Yeah, I won't want to store direct values into turd1. But for a one screen/one level game, it will work fine. I need to study the carry flag some more. I swear, the carry flag does nothing I tell it to. Well, it does, but I don't remember ever telling it to do things that it does!

<br />clc clears the carry flag, you probably have trouble assembling your code if that doesn't even work.

<br />
<br />If you already know tiley is already either $00, $08, $10, or $18, you can skip over the first 3 instructions.  This avoids a big ugly CMP/BEQ chain and shrinks the size of the routine.  As well as elimanates the need for those ugly storexx blocks

But no commercial games use it, that I'm aware of. Unless the colision is tile based, but the movement is animated, resulting in smooth animation with no extra complexity. That was often used with RPG's, and loks nice, but is worthless for a platformer.

<br />Platformer? If yes it must really suck. I don't think I ever saw a commercial platformer working like this. Maybe on reeeeeally limited systems, way more limited than the NES, but even so...
<br />
<br />There would be no acceleration at all... and jumping would absolutelly suck.
