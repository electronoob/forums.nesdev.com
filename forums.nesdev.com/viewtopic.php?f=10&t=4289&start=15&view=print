		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />That's werid. I'll have to see if I can test that with a multimeter when I get home.  The connector has a slot and an output for the "outer pins," (by which i assume you mean the seperate pins "floating" to the sides) but it may just be there as an anchor.  Thank's for the heads up though, if I could find a different connector that works with the Super-Gameboy, it would be preferable to using it outside of the case.  (Failing that, I was planning to build a custom case for it out of a spare cartridge.

<br />
<br />I checked with a multimeter, all of those connections seem to work, on both sides of both outer portions of the connector.  The connector appears to connect everything just fine.  And it's not dirty, because the first thing I did when the problem arose was extensively clean everything with proper solutions and supplies, not just water and a q-tip.  (At least proper in that I bought them from a shop selling them specifically for cleaning Nintendo cartridges. 
<br />
<br />Are there any other causes that come to mind? It seems odd that a connector would create that kind of interference if it was working properly.

<br />
<br />Not true. StarFox contains its own clock crystal. It doesn't need the clock from the SNES like later SFX games. This means StarFox will run through various adapters while other chip games will fail. I noticed this on my Game Doctor SF3, which plays StarFox when plugged in, but not any other chip games.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Maybe, I'm not really sure. But I do know that the Clock pin isn't needed on StarFox unlike other SuperFX and chip games. It's the only one that has its own clock inside I believe. If I recall the outter 16 pins connect to the B-Bus as I think a clock output from the SNES. But it's been awhile. Byuu would probably know this.
