I would suggest: Allow up to five cover and five original, but you can combine them into one file or into separate files or a combination of the two as long as five in total per section (and you are not allowed to put cover and original together in one file). Another thing this means, is make less bias judging if using separate files. I don't know how to tell to them but at least I would suggest it.<br /><br />Is it allow to have &quot;hidden&quot; tracks (such as the header says 5 tracks but if you set the accumulator to 42 you will get a secret music)? Is there file size limit? Is there music duration limit? Is it OK to write it to automatically compose the music by itself at runtime? Is there rule for NTSC/PAL? Is there rule for playback rate?<br /><br />I have written some .NSF musics but since I already release them, I don't know if I should? However, they are all public domain, I am OK with it if you take them, modify them, call them as your own, or whatever you want.
