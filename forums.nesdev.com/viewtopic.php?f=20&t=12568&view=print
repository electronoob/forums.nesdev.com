This appears to be a serious issue, Nintendo is reported to reject any games that do not follow this rule.<br /></div><br />However, in leaked official Nintendo Game Boy Programming Manual (version 1.0, released 11/09/1999) it's not mentioned that it can cause any hardware damage, only that &quot;a black horizontal line appears on the screen&quot; if LCD turned off outside of VBlank interval (except on Game Boy Color, where it's safe). Also it says that it's 'recommended', not 'required'.<br /><br />In the end, which one is correct?

I'm not a hardware guy, but if you flipped the POWER switch on a DMG while it was rendering mid-frame, wouldn't this be the equivalent of telling the MMIO register (LCDC) to do it via software? If that is indeed the case, I doubt you can damage DMG LCDs by simply shutting the system off. I haven't touched my GameBoy Pocket in ages, but iirc, you could see the &quot;line&quot; the official docs talk about when turning it off.<br /><br />Note that this isn't going to be an issue on the GBC afaik.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Have you ever heard of a concept on CRTs called &quot;screen burn-in&quot;?<br /><br />This is just a conjecture, but perhaps the drivers for each scanline were designed to pass a specific amount of current. Normally, the PPU drives each line for 109 microseconds (source: Pan Docs) before going onto the next line. Thus the average current over the course of, say, 10 seconds remains small. But if one line is driven constantly over a long period of time, it could cause the driver to pass more current than it's rated for, and things overheat.

Leaving an LCD with a net DC bias for too long will result in elements that are stuck on.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><a href="http://www.goldenviewdisplay.com/driving_LCD_display.html" class="postlink">Golden View Display Inc</a> wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">Prolonged DC operation may cause electrochemical reactions inside the displays which will cause significantly reduced life. The initial indications of display degradation because of excessive DC current is a loss of alignment along the edges of some of the characters. The visual indication will be a &quot;fuzzy&quot; appearance of some of the characters.<br /></div><div class="quotetitle"><a href="http://www.lxdinc.com/application_notes/lcd_direct_drive_techniques" class="postlink">LXD Inc</a> wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">The initial indications of display degradation because of excessive DC current is an electro-plating of liquid crystal components onto the surface electrodes. These will appear as a mirror-like &quot;burn-in&quot; of the electrode pattern that was energized with DC. Elevated temperature will accelerate this effect.<br /></div><br /><br />So, how long is too long? Dunno. If what you're really asking is &quot;I need a whole frame's time to upload something to the screen and I don't want to wait for vblank&quot; or &quot;I want to use mid-frame OAM refresh&quot;, it's probably fine.

(Maybe I just wasn't paying enough attention?)

Would that black line quickly fade out after turning LCD off by CPU like when you shut off whole Game Boy off or not? Unfortunately, I don't have flash cartridge for Game Boy to experiment.
