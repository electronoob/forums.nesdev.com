<br />
<br />I've got a Gen1 with the distorted sound, it was quite easy to fix. Just put a 10K resistor from the Op Amp output to GND.

<br />Hey, wasn't there a numbering difference between the consoles released in Brazil, like happened with the Master System? What the world calls "Master System 2" is known here in Brazil as "Master System 3", because TecToy had already released a Master System 2, that looked very much like the Master System 1 (I don't really know what the difference is).
<br />
<br />I have the impression that the same thing happened with the Megadrive, and TecToy released something called "Megadrive 2" before the actual Genesis 2 was released, and that one was named the "Megadrive 3" around here. I'm not sure though, as I can't seem to find any info on this right now.
<br />
<br />But if yours is named "<span style="text-decoration: underline">Genesis</span> 3", it probably is that model everyone is talking about, the one with sound and compatibility issues.

<br />
<br />The CDX would definitely be the smallest...

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I have two Genesis 2s, each with a completely different motherboard:
<br />
<br /><a href="http://www.rustedmagick.com/misc/gen2rev0.png" class="postlink">Revision 0?</a>
<br /><a href="http://www.rustedmagick.com/misc/gen2rev23.png" class="postlink">Revision 2.3?</a>
<br />
<br />Notice the lack of a YM3438 on the first board. My guess is that it's integrated into one of the custom SEGA chips (the video chip, maybe?). Also, one of the boards has the distorted/overdriven sound problem, while the other has a nearly inaudible PSG, though I don't recall which is which.
<br />
<br />While we're on the topic of Genesis stuffs, I may as well ask: has anyone else hooked up a Genesis + 32X to an RGB monitor, and if so, did you experience weird crashes with any games? For some reason, I can't get Knuckles' Chaotix to run for more than a minute or so without crashing when it's connected to my arcade monitor, but as soon as I connect it to a standard TV, it works again...? O_o
