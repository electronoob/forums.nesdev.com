		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Tonight I was trying to determine where in my code a screwed up value was being written to a specific memory location.  Specifically, I wanted to know when the value '$#ee' was being written to ZP memory location '$28'.
<br />
<br />I was unable to find any comprehensive documentation on the full syntax of what can be put into the "condition" text input field in the breakpoint dialog box.
<br />
<br />So I dug into the source code for FCEUX and found the parser:
<br />
<br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://fceux.sourcearchive.com/documentation/2.1.4aplus-prepack-0ubuntu1/conddebug_8cpp-source.html">http://fceux.sourcearchive.com/document ... ource.html</a><!-- m -->
<br />
<br />The grammar is listed near the top of the source file, right under the GPL banner.  I won't quote it here.
<br />
<br />I had been staring at the problem for too long.  thefox helped me.  This is what we did, and it worked.
<br /><ol style="list-style-type: decimal"><li>Set address = '28'  (no quotes)</li><li>Click 'write'</li><li>Memory should be 'CPU' (the default)</li><li>Condition = 'X == #ee' (no quotes)</li></ol>
<br />I was omitting the '#' and that was screwing it up.  The first three bullet points I assume that all of us using FCEUX's debugger have already figured out.  I knew that this memory location was only every written to by the 'X' register, so I used 'X'.  Had I used all three, I could have typed 'R' instead (as in 'R == $ee').
<br />
<br />I hope that this info can help others.  It was a bit annoying to track down.
<br />
<br />Again, thanks to our arctic fox for his help.
<br />

This thread/the wiki entry tepples made = for the win.

It covers most of what I've already covered, and a bit more.
