They are assigned their palette by the numbers given. <br /><br />from the start it's: <br /><br />01 02 03 02 01 01 03 03 03 01 01 02 02 21 01 02 01 01 02 FF 02 02 01 01 02 02 02 <br /><br />And at $687c is the Lakitu palette, which is 01. I changed it to 03. <br /><br />However in the picture I showed you, the corners seem to not change. <br /><br />I think it's caused by some gay routine for how it mirrors the lakitu cloud, but I don't get it. It's assigned in a confusing way. I'm not too good at ASM, but as how I editted this and all I'm pretty good at finding small values. <br /><br />I don't understand how it's assigned. Can someone please help? <br />There's an SMB Disassembly and all but like I said I'm not good with ASM besides maybe using it as a refference of what to edit. <br /><br />I'm one of those "wing it" type of guys. <br /><br />Please help. Pretty please? </div>
<br />
<br />I posted this on acmlm boards originally.  I wanted to post here too since ASM is pretty tightly known here.  I'm sure you guys can help.  I'm trying to make the whole Lakitu sprite's palette change but it's just not working.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I know that it's because of some routine that deals with the cloud sprite being horizontally flipped.  I know the problem I just don't know where to locate it and fix it.
<br />
<br />Maybe I'll point out some coding and post it on here as possibilities to what is causing it.
<br />
<br />I know it's a small error but I'm working on making an SMB1 hack that will end the "SMB1 with SMB3 graphics" frenzy.
<br />
<br />In my hack I got everything pretty much straight-down into a SMB3 scenereo, backgrounds are 'cactus' mountains and all, the bricks are just like SMB3 bricks, including the "hit" sprite of the brick, both in surface and underground.  The colors are all adapted to the most correct possible palette, with some exceptions, like how koopas don't have that overlay sprite for their shell color.  Mario's animation is completely as possible, correctly adapted into an SMB3 format without any bad sprite postures.  The islands/mushrooms are platforms as seen on SMB3's level 1-6.
<br />
<br />Pretty much all blemishes that any other SMB1 to 3 adaption is gone to give you the crisp SMB3 look in SMB1's game.

And you will then be able to see what page they store in, and then locate writes to that area of memory. If they work with $2003/$2004, I don't know too much about that; I always just dedicate a page of RAM to OAM.
<br />
<br />Searching for that will probably find you some answers.

<br />Did you make these names up? Because if the VerticalFlipFlag IS set, it will branch, because it Branches when Not Equal to zero. So if that byte IS one, or anything but zero, it will branch.

<br />
<br />Not really an ASM person but I assume $81 means to flip the tile and assign it palette $01, so I changed it to $83.
