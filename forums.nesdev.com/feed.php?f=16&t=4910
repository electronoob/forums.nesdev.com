In what order do I write to these registers" and things like that.<br /><br />I also miss introductions and overviews in the wiki, because you often follow links and land in pages that do not make very clear what they are talking about, they just dump technical information all over the user. I believe that a proper introduction to each subject and small overviews of how things work are extremely necessary before jumping into the hardcore stuff.<br /><br />EDIT: Sorry to be talking about the wiki at the wrong place. Maybe a split is in order?<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=95">tokumaru</a> — Sun Mar 01, 2009 8:31 pm</p><hr />

With PowerPak becoming more widespread, with registration on the old wiki disabled, and with Atarimike not showing any evidence of activity there or here, we <em>might</em> need a new wiki. I've fired off an e-mail to Atarimike through the wiki's "E-mail this user" function. But if we do move to a new wiki, a new useful policy might include encouraging editors to provide sample source code where practicable, such as test routines for corner cases.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=9">tepples</a> — Sun Mar 01, 2009 8:08 pm</p><hr />

What would need to be done is to take all existing documents about the nes and incorporate them inside the wiki, credit the original authors,  weed out the old information and put the most accurate one in it. That way, no more missing links in the future. The problem is who wants to do that since this job is not the most fun to do.  I would like to help on that someday, once I can finish the few tools I'm working on.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3559">Banshaku</a> — Sun Mar 01, 2009 8:04 pm</p><hr />
