But good luck getting the rom kiddies to produce such disassemblies.

<br />This needs to be ironed out, I think.  Spam is ok, as long as it's for a Nintendo platform?  Why limit it to MMO services?
<br />
<br />If you need to make this a rule, just have some general No Spamming / No Commercial Advertising rule.
<br />
<br />I suppose exceptions should be made for things of obvious interest to the board, like retrousb.com coming out with a new NES product or whatever.

<br />Looks like you need to add a clause about chinese pottery and Kung Fu classes.
<br />
<br />(edit)
<br />Judging by our <a href="http://nesdev.com/bbs/memberlist.php?mode=joined&amp;order=DESC" class="postlink">new members' www links</a>, you might also want to consider preemptively banning ads for beauty products, korean software(?), and luxury watches.

<br />
<br />Also, just as posts that answer to a NESDev topic and switch to another topic are moved on a new thread, posts that answer NESDev topic with a topic with no relation at all (or just posts that make no sense and answers posts that make sense) should be moved to a garbage thread or something like that.

<br />
<br />How old is this version of phpBB, anyway? Recent versions are probably less susceptible to automated spam attacks. At the very least, I'm sure you can find modifications to the registration code that would block them at the first step (a CAPTCHA, perhaps?).

<br />I think rules are for guiding regular user behavior, not telling mods what they can or can't do. 
<br />
<br />A moderator who can't deal with situations on his own, relying on a book of codes to tell him what to do would be a ineffectual moderator indeed. 
<br />
<br />This is all just common sense net etiquitte anyway. If someone acts up, bop him on the head and carry on. 
<br />
<br />DAMN ALL THESE STUPID RULES, HOW LONG HAS THIS BOARD BEEN RUNNING? WHAT HAS CHANGED IN JUST ONE WEEK TO F*CK EVERYTHING UP? 
<br />
<br />Nothing, just trivial sh!t. In a week or two, it will blow over and be back to normal. Except for that new pile of rules and a moderator running around playing police man. 
<br />
<br />Oh crap. Now we need a rule about typing in caps.

<br />
<br />I feel what loopy is saying in this post. I mean, there hasn't ever been a need for rules around here, and I think there still isn't a need. Things should always be dealt with on a case-by-case basis on a forum like NESDev. For the most part, it's quiet around here. I think that's a REALLY good thing. People get more tight with each other, listen to each other, etc.... whatever, that's a different subject.
<br />
<br />What I'm getting at is just because there has been some different posts on this board than what we're used to, doesn't mean we have to change things and add "rules" to it. This has always been a good spot where none of us had to worry about rules, only worry if our code was good enough or not ; )
<br />
<br />I'd personally like to see the rules be gone, and do as what loopy said above, use common sense net etiquette when using moderation powers.
