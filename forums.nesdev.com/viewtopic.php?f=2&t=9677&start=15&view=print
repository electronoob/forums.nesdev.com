What can this 40kb one do that the 8kb one can't? It sounds like that space of 32kb is just &quot;junk&quot; to me from what everybody is saying. But this article says its for temp. program storage.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />The FDS loads serial blocks from the disk into RAM. If it doesn't initialize a part of the RAM with code, or load serial data into it, it is simply uninitialized (i.e. whatever was there last remains, possibly random stuff if it was just turned on).<br /><br />Also, FDS disk images are not really ROM, though it's often convenient to call them that in an emulator context. Disks could be writable.

The temporary data is that stuff that just got loaded, in fact.<br /><br />Remember, the main reason it has RAM is because the CPU can't retrieve the instructions directly from the disk (with a cartridge you'd just run the game from ROM instead). The game needs to be loaded <em>somewhere</em> before it can run the code =P The 2KB of RAM the NES has built-in is too little for game data so the FDS adds more RAM (32KB).

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />An &quot;overdump&quot; is a ROM dump that contains more data than the actual ROM does. The 16K, 24K, 32K, and 40K dumps of the FDS BIOS are overdumps. But in the case of one NES game, the overdump is actually the correct dump because Galaxian's PRG ROM is 8K, smaller than the iNES PRG size unit of 16K. And if you try to dump an FDS as if it were NROM, it'll be an overdump as well.<br /><br />When byuu developed bsnes, he developed a &quot;purify&quot; tool that strips off copier headers. Likewise, a &quot;purify&quot; tool for the NES would correct iNES headers and convert an iNES-formatted dump of the FDS or Game Genie BIOS by taking the last few K of the PRG ROM.

Components like RAM and Mappers are emulated. They don't exist in a file. <br /><br />Also beware that Wikipedia is a poor source for technical information on video game and computer systems. While some information may be somewhat accurate, you can't rely on it.
