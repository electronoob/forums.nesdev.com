<br /><em>Batman</em> for Game Boy had a similar effect to blend the word "BATMAN" and the bat-symbol. They got away with it because the original Game Boy's LCD, like most LCDs of the time, was high persistence. The credits of <em>Link's Awakening</em> use the same effect.
<br />
<br />The effect could be improved by switching between images per scanline, displaying odd lines from image A and even lines from image B in one frame and vice versa in the other. This would kill most of the flicker if images A and B have little correlation (as in the <em>Batman</em> case); it won't help if flicker blending is used as a method of temporal dithering (as in Chris Covell's NES demos and in PocketNES).

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Syvalion does definitely interlace, with part of it using mode 5, because SNES9x does output high resolution both horizontally and vertically (unlike Seiken Densetsu 2/3 wich only increase the resolution horizontally).
<br />However, I don't see any SNES game interlacing using just normal mode 1 increasing the resolution only vertically.
<br />And is it possible to trick the ouput signal to be interlaced on the NES ? I saw Cris Covell's demoes, but they did seems to interlace, but since no emulators actually interlace both frames, and most probably the real NES won't do it either, this isn't really interlacing.
<br />Flickering does definitely look a lot better on a real TV than what it does under most emulators, but still, it doesn't look smooth at all, at least not like interlacing does/is supposed to do.
<br />
<br />EDIT : If the SNES has a flag that allow the SNES to output the exact same signal, but interlaced, this means that the fix images won't budge, but that the animated images may flicker a weird way. Is that what Axelay/Level 4 and Ranma 1/2 does ?
<br />This could be great for games using mode 7 for 3D effects, because with the exact same maps and all, the game could change the matrix coeficiant by a fine value each scanline, so that the rendered image would have more precision vertically, and look a lot better, without wasting any tiles nor map space !!
