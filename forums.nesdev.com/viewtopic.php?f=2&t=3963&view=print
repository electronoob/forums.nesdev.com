<br />You can use the following $2005/2006 magic to test those two bits:
<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">bit $2002<br />lda #0<br />sta $2005<br />sta $2005<br />sta $2005<br />sta $2006</div>
<br />This will make the active VRAM address either $0000, $0400, $0800, or $0C00, depedning on $2000 bits 0-1.  The writes to $2005 cause all 15 bits of the "scroll latch" registers to become clear, except the nametable select bits.  The fourth write (the one to $2006) forces the contents of the latch to be transferred to the VRAM address register.  Bits 0-1 of $2000 correspond to bits 10-11 of the VRAM address.

I extracted the init code from Tiger-Heli and sure enough, it fails to enable NMI often at power on my NES. On further testing, I found that if I power the NES down for several seconds between tests, then it works most of the time. So apparently the VBL flag is usually clear at power if the NES was off for a while, and often set if it was recently on. What's the other game that someone was saying needed the VBL flag set at power?

<br />Odd. Are you modifying it during rendering? It should only be modified when the 2A03 reads from $2007 (and its mirrors). The test sets PPUADDR to $0010, which is the beginning of a run of $FF bytes, then reads from PPUDATA, which should put $FF into the buffer. Then it goes into an infinite loop, so the buffer should still contain $FF after reset if your emulator isn't clearing it during reset.
<br />
<br />On the hunch that maybe the VBL flag is getting cleared during the first frame, I tried delaying 26000 clocks then reading $2002 after power, and quickly powering off then on several times. I still got $80, so the VBL flag isn't getting cleared before it's next set at ~27384. Oh well.
<br />
<br />We need someone with Tiger Heli, Ironsword, and Cobra Triangle (PowerPak won't suffice) to see how often they work when powering up the NES after being off for a while, and after being off for only a couple of seconds. I'm guessing some won't work all the time in these cases. I'm going to see if I can extract the init code from each and test it on my NES.
<br />
<br />I found a couple of old threads dealing with this issue <a href="http://nesdev.com/bbs/viewtopic.php?t=649" class="postlink">"Let's uncover power-up and reset behavior"</a> and <a href="http://nesdev.com/bbs/viewtopic.php?t=635" class="postlink">"APU Frame IRQ Flag and IRQ Timing"</a>.

<br />
<br /><strong>EDIT:</strong> OK, got a big rewrite of the PPU power/reset test ROMs done, and covering these new findings ("only" 37 test ROMs). <a href="http://nesdevwiki.org/index.php/Power-up_state_of_PPU" class="postlink">NesDevWiki page</a> is updated as well. Main finding was that if the NES is off for 20 seconds or more, all registers work at power, and $2002, $2003, and $2006 are 0.
