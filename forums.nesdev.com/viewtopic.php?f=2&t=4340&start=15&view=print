<br />
<br />My polygon engine has a solid white tile that will always be in the same exact place and will never be over written in CHR RAM. I can use this same white tile for sprite #0 which I put on screen once and never need to update. So I think I've found my answer. This will give a good display area of 32x20, which is just a little taller than the widescreen 16:9 ratio. I'll definitely be getting back to you all once I have a good polygon video to show =). Thanks!

<br />
<br />Be sure to read the whole thread -- I started out with "this'll never work", but made a 180 pretty quick.
<br />
<br />Basic outline:
<br />
<br />1)  put several dummy sprites on the scanline where you want to turn the PPU back on (iirc, blargg figured you'd only need to reserve 3 sprites for this)
<br />
<br />2)  leave the PPU off until you finish all your drawing (this can spill past the end of VBlank -- after all that is kind of the point)
<br />
<br />3)  turn <em>sprite rendering</em> on, but leave BG rendering off.
<br />
<br />4)  wait at least 1 full scanline (or more) so that the PPU can get on track with its OAM fetches.
<br />
<br />5)  start polling $2004 looking for your dummy sprite fetches.
<br />
<br />6)  once you've found your scanline, reset your scroll and turn BG rendering on.
<br />
<br />
<br />As long as you get to step 3 before your target scanline is hit, you should be in the clear.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Oh yeah, I forgot about this! This is a pretty nifty scheme... So yeah, I'll turn off the bottom part with sprite #0, and turn it back on once it reaches the bottom of the top part using these tricks! Thanks for mentioning this!
<br />
<br />
<br />EDIT: I seem to be having some issues... Perhaps I'm not seeing something, but I have like 6 dummy sprites set to $E3 for the X, Attribute and Tile, and I have it on Y = #40. The only other sprite I have is sprite 0, which has none of those values. Every other value in OAM is $FE. Then I have my loop doing this:
<br />
<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">loop:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;lda #$50<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;sta $2001<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;lda #$E3<br />-<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;cmp $2004<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;bne -<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;lda #$1E<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;sta $2001<br />-<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;lda $99<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;bne -<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;lda #$00<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;sta $99<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;jmp loop</div>
<br />
<br />In my NMI code, I set $99 to equal #1. Is there something I'm not understanding here? This is just to see that the detection works properly, but I think I'm missing something.

<br />
<br />While it is <em>pronounced</em> "dish", it is in fact spelled "Disch"  ;P
<br />
<br />But yeah.  Most emus will probably choke.  Newer FCEU versions might work (it's possible FCEUX will work, but I doubt earlier versions of FCEUXD/FCEUD would).  I don't see why Nintendulator or Nestopia wouldn't work.  $2004 read behavior has been known for a while.

Most people will be playing my game on emus anyways, and if it doesn't work, it's not likely people are gonna go download the newest version of every emu to get it to work. Also, each section of my drawing code will take a specific amount of time, so I can just make it so it will turn on the screen at the right time. 
<br />
<br />My only concern is the virtual drawing part. How long that takes will depend on how complicated the frame is. So this will mean I can only do the virtual drawing when the screen is on, then I have to wait for the sprite #0 hit. For the bottom blanked part, I'll still be able to do some virtual drawing, and I'll just have to waste time in the NMI for 40 scanlines outside of Vblank. This makes me a little sad, because that's so much time wasted.

<br />Well, if your game/demo comes with a website/doccumentation that says which emulators are needed it's likely some people will look into that to play your game/demo. But if you say it's only working on the real console and that no emulator in the world support it most definitely few people will try it on their devcatrs, especially if it uses an advanced mapper.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />It's a little more likely, but I'd rather just have everyone able to play it on regular emulators. I mostly don't want anyone to miss out =).
<br />
<br />And also, I don't even have the materials to test this on hardware right now. I mean, I have a programmer (though every time I've burnt something to a chip, it didn't work), but I don't have all the chips I need. So basically I would like it to use as little real-NES-only functions as possible. Most people that I'll send this to won't know a thing about NES hardware; they'll probably just know how to open a ROM in an emulator.
<br />
<br />At any rate, I think my blanking methods will be fine. Thanks for your help guys!
