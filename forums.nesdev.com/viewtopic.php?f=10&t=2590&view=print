<br />
<br />It's only 2 pins, shouldn't be too hard to remove I'd imagine.  Just add some fresh solder to it if it's not melting properly.

<br />
<br />Yeah Bregalad, I am buying them with the pins since I'm somewhat scared that I'll blow a lithium battery by applying too much heat.  That way I can use a couple of clips to dissipate heat.
<br />
<br />If I can add a second battery, I figure I can just add it to the back of the circuit board and be as lazy as possible!

I cannot guarantee that your house will explode or anything, but current will continue to be drawn from the old battery and that is bad. It is actually easier to just replace it. As you mentionned, it's not a good idea to solver stuff direcly on a raw battery. I tried, and while I didn't do any damage to the cart, me or whathever, I just had to waste that battery and buy one with pins.
<br />Just disolver your old battery and place a new one with pins wich are similar to the circuit. Don't forget to recycle your old battery, and you're done.

<br />
<br />I'm not finding the ones with tabs for much under a $1.50 a battery + shipping.  If you buy them in bulk, the ones without tabs are much cheaper.  Does anyone know where to get ones with tabs that are the right specs for cheaper?  If I can find a good price, I'll probably even buy 50 at once.

<br />Here, A, B and C are the 3 pins (B and C connected together). When cutting pin C, I got the exact right distance between A and B to solder on a NES board. Don't know if I were just lucky tough.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />as far as having 2 battery's in parallel, if one battery is failing it might draw more current. 
<br />Having 2 rechargeable battery's that do not have the same charge time could have an over charging  effect on the faster charging battery. 
<br />If one battery does not charge to a full +5V it will cause a voltage drop from the good battery.
<br />
<br />Its best to replace the battery, or have some one replace it for you.
