<br />
<br />I hope you do realize that Action 52 was a complete joke. The idea was that Action 52 contains quite possibly the worst games ever made, and therefore, it's so completely awful overall that its in fact also the best game at the same time. 
<br />
<br />In other words, Action 52 is sort of the Schr√∂dinger's cat of videogames.  
<br />
<br />But even so, I own Action 52 (I found a copy in the wild for a ridiculously low $40) and it's great at parties for how much and as much satire as I put into it, I actually do like the Cheetahmen theme song. The orchestrated version from nico nico douga is completely hilarious, and the mock-orchestra seemingly preforming it completes the illusion.

<br />
<br />As I've said on the offset of each part, the NES and Famicom saw over two thousand releases worldwide. Narrowing that number down to even 500 worthy games is tricky, so you begin to see the problem of limiting it just to the top 100. My top 100 very likely is shaped different than most people's, and once you accept that you can appreciate it for what it is. The only thing I can say about my list is that I explain my reasons and stand by them. You are completely free to disagree and arrange your own top 100. In fact, I'd love to read it myself if you can back up your reasoning and give the level of detail I have.

<br />
<br />When you revealed #3, I wrote out your list and tried to rank some likely candidates for the top 2 spots and came up with this:
<br />
<br />1. Mega Man 2
<br />2. Gimmick!
<br />3. Battletoads
<br />4. Castlevania 2
<br />5. Dragon Warrior
<br />6. Ufouria
<br />7. Kid Icarus
<br />8. Metal Gear
<br />9. Ninja Gaiden
<br />10. Super C
<br />
<br />Not too far off!
<br />
<br />Thanks a lot for putting together the list, I really enjoyed it.  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" />

I'm used to the boring top 10 game article always listing the most obvious, mega-famous games that everyone know so reading an article that actually included good game that kind of passed under the radar was refreshing. I actually played a few game after reading because of your list. I finished Bucky O'Hare, Akumajou Special, Wai Wai World 2 and I'm playing Kabuki Quantum right now. So Thanks alot!

<br />
<br />I need to make sure it works lol
<br />
<br />word of warning: this post contains over 53,000 words, somewhere around 500 images, and about 100 embedded youtube links. I do NOT recommend it viewed on mobile devices.
<br />
<br />I've gone back through it and corrected errors as I saw them, but I probably missed some. If you spot mistakes, let me know so I can fix them!
