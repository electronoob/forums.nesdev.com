		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I've got some new questions:<br /><br /><br />1. I created some functions to initialize graphics data: Background, palette, attributes.<br />At first, I set the corresponding high and low byte at address 0x2006. Then, I assign a global pointer variable to a constant that contains the data. (This way, I can load new data for new levels.) Until now, everything is fine. Here is a code snippet:<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">/* Pointer to the constant that is written. */<br />const unsigned char *Data;<br /><br />/* The loop that writes certain data to the PPU.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;(The kind of data is specified by setting high<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;and low value to 0x2006 before calling this function. */<br />void DoLoop()<br />{<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;/* 0xFF is simply defined as the end-of-data character since the<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;constant arrays have an unknown length. */<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;while (*Data != 0xFF)<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;{<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;*(unsigned char *)0x2007 = *Data;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;++Data;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;}<br />}</div><br />But as soon as the assignment isn't absolutely constant, it doesn't work anymore:<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">const unsigned char *Data;<br /><br />unsigned char i;<br /><br />void DoLoop()<br />{<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;i = 0;<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;while (*Data != 0xFF)<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;{<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;*(unsigned char *)(0x2007 + i) = *Data;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;/* Since i = 0, 0x2007 + i should still be 0x2007,<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;only that it isn't known at compile time. */<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;++Data;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;}<br />}</div><br />So, from a logical point of view, both functions should do the same. The only difference is that in the first function, the address is known at compile time.<br /><br />If you're asking yourself why I even need this: Well, when writing sprites, the PPU access isn't to a constant address anymore. While you can write background, palettes and attributes to 0x2007 and the PPU increments its internal address automatically, writing sprites requires writing to address (0x0200 + numberOfAlreadyWrittenBytes).<br /><br />So, how does this function work even with a variable address?<br /><br /><br />2. How do I put variables into the zero page?<br /><br />I tried this here:<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">extern unsigned char variable;<br />#pragma zpsym (&quot;variable&quot;);</div><br />And then, in crt0.s, I declared:<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">.segment &quot;ZEROPAGE&quot;<br />_variable: .res 1</div><br />But this gives me a compiler error: &quot;Error: Symbol `_variable' is already defined&quot;.<br />That's because my generated assembly file declares:<div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">&nbsp; .importzp&nbsp; &nbsp;_variable</div><br /><br />So, how do I properly declare variables in the zero page that I want to use in the C code <em>and</em> in my crt0.s?

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />CC65 doesn't know that $2007 is a volatile address, and in some situations it will use instructions the indirect indexed STA which generates an extra write that will interfere with your attempt to load data into the PPU.<br /><br />You may want to read this thread if you want some more details about it: <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/viewtopic.php?f=2&amp;t=9407" class="postlink">http://forums.nesdev.com/viewtopic.php?f=2&amp;t=9407</a><br /><br />If you want the short answer, it's that you have to be very careful what syntax you use for writing to volatile registers (e.g. $2003, $2004, $2005, $2006, $2007) in CC65. Specifically, this syntax seems to generate correct code:<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">*((unsigned char*)0x2007) = a</div><br /><br />Don't mess around with arrays or adding an index, etc. for this purpose, you need to make sure the compiler generates code that only produces one write when the number of writes matters. The problem arises because in all other situations the extra write is a harmless side effect, and CC65 was not written with this in mind, as it is likely a problem unique to the NES. (There is a &quot;volatile&quot; keyword in C which could potentially solve this problem, but CC65 ignores it.)

That's what the compiler makes from my C source code. That's why I wanted to know: What do I have to do to declare a zero page variable that can be used in my C code and in my hand-written assembly code?<br /><br />@rainwarrior: So, I guess it's back to writing the function in Assembly again.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />You can put variables declared in C code into zero page using pragmas. Not sure which ones, as it has been changes between recent CC65 versions, in the version that I use it is this:<br /><br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">#pragma bssseg (push,&quot;ZEROPAGE&quot;)<br />#pragma dataseg(push,&quot;ZEROPAGE&quot;)<br /><br />static unsigned char i; //after the pragmas global vars are going to ZP</div><br /><br />There is no .export directives in the generated assembly code, though, but I guess that if you declare the same var as an extern first, it may work for your purposes, in a hacky way.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />@Shiru:<br /><br />Thanks. This method works now.<br /><br />I don't understand this whole export and import stuff anyway. My code starts in &quot;crt0.s&quot;, right? In this file, I simply include the other files. So, when I have a file called &quot;functions.c&quot;, then I know that the compiler will transform it into &quot;functions.s&quot;. So, I just write <tt style="margin-left: 2px; margin-right: 2px; padding:3px; background-color: #3355aa; color: white;">.include &quot;Functions.s&quot;</tt> into &quot;crt0.s&quot; and that's it. Isn't this the correct way to combine the source files?<br /><br />However, there's still a warning in my source code: When I declare a global zeropage variable in my C code:<div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">#pragma bssseg (push,&quot;ZEROPAGE&quot;)<br />byte variable;</div><br />and I use it in the &quot;crt0.s&quot; like this:<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">&nbsp; LDA #$00<br />&nbsp; STA _variable</div><br />then the compiler says: &quot;Warning: Didn't use zeropage addressing for `_variable'&quot;.<br />The error message refers to the line with the STA command. What do I have to change here?<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">thefox wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">If that is indeed the error you get, you do have a multiple definitions of _variable somewhere. The code you gave should work just fine, as long as you .export the symbol from your assembly file (crt0.s).</div><br />As I said: My non-crt0.s code is not an assembly file, it's a C file. And I cannot control what .exports and .imports the compiler writes into the .s file that it creates out of the .c file.<br />According to <a href="http://www.cc65.org/mailarchive/1999-10/1024.html" class="postlink">that link</a> you have to declare the variable in your assembly code (i.e. in &quot;crt0.s&quot;) and then declare it as extern in your C file and do a #pragma zpsym for this variable.<br />So, I myself never used any .import or .export. That's all done by the compiler. Does that mean the solution in the link is incorrect or did I misunderstand something there?

Like with greater C compiler suites, you either manually link (ld65 here) all the objects together after all the compilation stages, or just use cl65 to run it all automatically.<br />crt0 should: clear uninitialized memory<br />maybe wait for the PPU to warm up<br />any other generic setup, such as disabling interrupts<br />copy things from ROM to RAM (for any line in your foo.cfg that specifies a separate load and run segment)<br />and then jump to main<br /><br />By including the generated assembly file, you effectively have &quot;import&quot; and &quot;export&quot; in the same file, hence the errors.
