		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />If I use sprite auto-DMA ($4014) my sprites update fine. However, I only need 2 sprites so I thought I'd manage them manually to save having to have 256 byte sprite buffer.
<br />
<br />But something weird seems to happen. The first sprite updates OK but when I try to update the second one, both of them disappear.
<br />
<br />I stripped down the code to the bone to debug;
<br />
<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">updateSprite<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; lda #$00<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;sta $2003<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;sta $2003<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;lda #$34<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;sta $2004<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;lda #$11<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;sta $2004<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;lda #$00<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;sta $2004<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;lda #$34<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;sta $2004<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;lda #$44<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;sta $2004<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;lda #$12<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;sta $2004<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;lda #$00<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;sta $2004<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;lda #$44<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;sta $2004<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;rts<br /></div>
<br />
<br />This makes the sprites disappear but if I comment out the last write to $2004, the first sprite is drawn.
<br />
<br />I'm calling this in the NMI during VBLANK with the screen off.
<br />
<br />What's happening? <img src="./images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" alt=":(" title="Sad" />

Do you mean you disabled BG and Sprites? I've heard that the OAM won't refresh under certain conditions and decay if you don't have the screen on.

<br />
<br />I added some code to just increment the X &amp; Y values of both sprites. Sprite 0 is fine but sprite 1 is pushed off the far right of the screen - I guess it's X coordinate is being set to $FF somehow.
<br />
<br />And I tried not calling my screen_off routine in the NMI but it makes no difference to the sprites.

<br />Unlikely the problem is in the logic here, but rather it's a quirk in the NES hardware. I've heard some people say you "shouldn't" update sprites manually as it can mess things up but I'm sure there's a a logical explanation to way things work. I just don't remember seeing the behavior explained very well anywhere.
<br />
<br />One thing you could try is writing #0 to $2003 after you've updated the sprites. That's just a guess though. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Maybe someone else can chime in with better info, but myself I've always advised against using $2004 for writing because I've never seen any known-working program do that (not that I've looked extensively).  My early programs did that because I had so few sprites, but when I had them tested IIRC the sprites didn't all show up.  I've kinda wondered if $2003 is there only for internal use by the DMA, but I don't really have any understanding of why that would be.
<br />
<br />I know there was an interesting thread on here a while back about $2003/$2004, but I think it was mostly about tricks based on reading it for a kind of very hacky scanline detection.
<br />
<br />If you <em>really</em> need the extra RAM you can still use the DMA, but strategically use the inconsequential bytes of the buffer page (basically all of them except the tile #).  It'd be non-contiguous though.  I actually did that on my Hot Seat Harry game, it uses the zeropage for sprites and everything else!  That was entirely to make the program smaller, so it'd fit in 1kB.

<br />
<br />It's a weird one alright.
<br />
<br />LOL @ your using the unused portions of the sprite buffer - that's the conclusion I came to. And yes, I <em>really</em> need the RAM. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />
