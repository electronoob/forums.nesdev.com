		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I've been modifying the source code to PCEAS to add more functionality. I realized that NESASM is part of that source code and the changes I've made apply when I build NESASM with the internal switch.
<br />
<br /> So that point, if people still use NESASM - anything you would like to see added? Mind you, I'm not a professional level C programmer. I normally just write support utilities for my console programming needs. And while PCEAS/NESASM source code is a headache and a half, I've been getting fairly familiar with it in the short time I've been debugging/tracing through it.
<br />
<br /> What I changed/added so far:
<br />
<br /> - No more 8k opcodes greater than 1 byte crossing errors. I completely uncapped the range, incremented the page and bank registers. So don't have to worry about instructions giving errors on page crosses for 16k bank setups. The banks are still 8k in size, so you still need to take care/track of the numbering system on your side.
<br />
<br /> - Added ".DWL" and ".DWH". No more manually having to tell the DB defined data to use the LSB or MSB on each entry. These do it automatically.
<br />
<br /> - Modified the macro naming rules. You can now use the dot '.' character in the macro name. This was driving me nuts for a while. Makes the macros look cleaner:  move.b #$12, label or move.w #1234, label or etc.
<br />
<br /> I have plans to add a bank alignment function and some sort of define bank value for a label, like .DB/DB/DWL/DWH do. For those tri-split tables for when you need longer pointer arrays.
<br />
<br /> Any suggestions/comments/complaints? Is it worth it? Or does NESASM just need to die and I can just concentrate on PCEAS?

<br />
<br /> Adding a switch to the command line to use 16k banking is possible. I'll add that to the list. Or just an internal #define (I did modification/function addition stuff like that for HuC. A C compiler that builds asm code for PCEAS. Passing symbols directly to the assembler).

<br />
<br /> PCEAS and NESASM share the same macro system AFAIK. And IMO it's pretty damn powerful macro system. What are some of the strengths of ASM6?

<br />
<br />
<br />And also, why not use both? Not like it hurts. I like [], but seems like () is standard. Oh well.
<br />
<br />And I though ASM6 would be better to write games with for the + - system for labels, that needs to be added. But everything about ASM6 sucks to me. Not fun to set up banks and everything, but the + - branching system is amazing.

<br />As far as I know, he took the nesasm 2.51 source and fixed it up a little. He removed the [] and () issue for indexed addressing for example.
<br />He called it NESASM 3 and his nerdy nights tutorials are based on it.
<br />I never used it much , so I can't tell you if it really makes the whole thing worth a try.
<br />Or is PCEAS something completely different than the just nesasm from the magickit?
<br />Sounds like PC-Engine assembler to me...

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Yeah, adding +/- local labels should be doable. I kind of like them too. But I hate when people go waaaay over bard with them. When you start seeing them stacked as -- / ++ and ---- / ++++. Makes code less readable. If you need more then just one +/- in an area, the ".local" label is much cleaner and easier to follow.
<br />
<br /> Another thing I like, is redefinable symbols. I only had to use them once, and for another system/cpu (68k based) - but it was kinda cool. The idea of actually implementing it sounds like a pain though.
<br />
<br /> The problem with using () is that the parsing logic uses it for higher level logic. The way the parser detects whether a higher level assemble time calculation is inside those brackets if fairly complex. At least to me. But I'll look into it.

<br />
<br /> It is. PCEAS is built from NESASM. And the version from Mkit pretty much just changes a few things between the two EXE builds (they share the same source code). I wasn't aware of bunnyboy's version. Although the version that comes with HuC, which has the newest Mkit source code, labels PCEAS and NESASM as 3.21 Denki release builds. That's the folk I'm using (HuC's included AS kit, not Mkit from MagicEngine site).

Yeah, that sounds kinda hard, but if you can make it detect the variables/labels/whatever inside the opcodes, shouldn't you be able to "filter out" what is being done there possibly? And it's not like you can multiply with those, seems like if you were you'd probably just better write some better assembly. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" />

<br />
<br />It wasn't "easy" to fix, no.  I fixed it in my assembler that uses flex/yacc.  I had to add a couple of disambiguation rules to the grammar to cover the cases where the one-symbol look-ahead of the parser couldn't otherwise disambiguate the meaning of the '(' token in the stream.
<br />
<br />The parser code is <a href="https://gitorious.org/nesicide/nesicide/blobs/master/compiler/pasm_asm.y" class="postlink">here</a>.
<br />
<br />Obviously yacc takes LALR(1) grammars and turns them into C code so there might be some way to take what I did and translate it into your C code [I assume you're using C].
<br />
<br />Figuring that part out was one of the most fun parts of writing my own assembler.   <img src="./images/smilies/icon_cool.gif" alt="8)" title="Cool" />

<br />
<br /> If that is bunnyboy's build, the identification string has been removed from defs.h. It also looks like it was modified from an older source file set than from the Mkit AS source files used in HuC. Because all the PCE references are still in there, but older style (looks like Mkit 2.51 CD references). Though the exe reports 3.1 IIRC.
<br />
<br /> I did some text compare and little has been changed between the source, so I still haven't found what he changed for [] to ().
<br />
<br />
<br />cpow: Yeah, if I was writing this from scratch - I think it'd be a little easier in <em>some</em> respects. It's not much fun trying to figure out someone else mess, let alone my own <img src="./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" />
<br />
<br />
<br />3gengames: Would -/+ labels as .- and .+ be ok?
<br />
<br /> Like:
<br />
<br />.-
<br /> rol zp1
<br /> bcs .+
<br /> dez zp
<br /> bne .-
<br /> .+
<br />
<br /> You could stack them too like: .--- .+++, etc. From what I've seen in other assemblers, they still have to obey the same rules as local labels, right? Or are they even sub level regular local labels? As in, you can redefine then again in between local labels (and not global labels)?

<br />
<br /> Nah, same people. Dave Shadoff, David Micheal (sp?) and Zeograd (he modified some ancient 6502 C compiler from the 80's and turned it into HuC compiler layer to build the ASM layer for Mkit, to assemble the code eventually into rom or CD). I'm the only one that did anything with it in the past few years. I didn't care for using C myself for these old consoles, but I thought it would have been great for beginners or people not that serious to get something up and running on their console.
<br />
<br /> I worked on the back end library for a couple of years. 2008 or so. The library is all written in ASM, so it made it easy to add C level functions, Pragma_fastcall was an awesome function for defining C functions that passed directly to the assembler (avoiding using the slow as crap software stack) and argument overload too (I think PROCs already do this, so maybe it was just pass through for PROCs). But no one ended up using it, save for a few people that made some demos. I added SuperGrafx support and Arcade Card support too. But meh, it doesn't natively support 24bit pointers so it makes any serious coding/projects almost worthless.
