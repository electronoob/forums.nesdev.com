Don't throw shit out there about how great some game was and it only used a UNROM or MMC1 board. What if someone is designing a game and it NEEDS 1KB CHR switching? What if they need more than a single 16K swappable bank? Who are you to tell them they don't need it? I think it's stupid to assume that everyone should just be happy with discrete mappers and the MMC1 clone. They are great choices to have, but some people will want something more capable. What if tomorrow someone popped up and they'd created some amazing game using MMC1 or NROM and they needed a MMC3 class mapper for the next game? Are you just gonna tell them you know best again?
<br />
<br />Let people develop their ideas with whatever mapper they want. I think it's pretty clear that something a bit more powerful than the MMC1 clone will be needed by someone. Just my opinion that people shouldn't be telling other people what mapper they have to use.

<br />You do know that "carefully designed games" and "good mapper hardware" are not mutually exclusive, right? I agree with you 100% that gameplay is way more important than visuals, but if we can have both, why not have the tools available? A crappy game is a crappy game, regardless of the <span class="posthilit">graphics</span>, and the same is true for good games.

<br />In fact me I'd like one, but maybe not immediately right now.  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=":wink:" title="Wink" /> 
<br />
<br />Well I guess I'm moving to Playstation dev so that this mapper crap flaming will not be there any longer, and I won't be told that I'm supposed to work with a limited system all the time and that I should switch to a more powerfull system if I'm unhappy.
<br />Unfortunately I don't see any PS-dev communauty anywhere.  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_cry.gif" alt=":cry:" title="Crying or Very sad" /> 
<br />
<br />And back to NES dev, yes nobody should impose a mapper to someone else, so this whole thread has no point.
<br />
<br />In summary from what people are saying (I'm not saying I agree) :
<br />
<br />- If you want to make a game and want to limit you to what developpers did before use a common mapper the smaller possible to suit your project in this order : NROM, CNROM, GNROM, UNROM, AOROM, MMC1, MMC3, MMC5
<br />
<br />- If you want to make a game that is freely downloadable care about emulator compatibility but want to have a powerfull mapper, use MMC5, FME-7, N106 or anything like that.
<br />
<br />- If you want to make a game that will be on cartridge support only, make your own CPLD mapper and you don't mind emulator compatibilty (in practice it will be VERY hard to developp such a game without testing on an emulator, so you'd want to make it like a mapper mentionned above but slightly modified to fit a CPLD optimally)
<br />
<br />- If you still feel too limited, move to another platform for developping games. You could still do a pseudo-NES game without getting it running on any NES hardware, like Mega Man 9.

<br />
<br />That basically sums up my opinion too. I do plan to make an NROM platformer just to test my abilities in terms of consolidation and limits, and still have relatively good <span class="posthilit">graphics</span>, but I didn't fall in love with the NES because of 1 screen games that you play for 5 minutes and then get bored with (e.g. Golf or some shit), or even because of SMB1. Games like Battletoads, Bucky O'Hare, Batman: Return of the Joker, Final Fantasy 3, Castlevania 3, etc. are beautiful works of art on a very limited -system-. So long as the NES and a cartridge can work together to make a great game with great <span class="posthilit">graphics</span> and sound, that's enough. It's showing that it can happen that's fun; not necessarily making it happen within 32k of PRG and 8k of CHR.

<br />What you describe is basically the FME-7 aka Sunsoft 5b. I like the FME-7, though it would be nice if the IRQ wasn't only a CPU Cycle timer, but also had a scanline PPU counting mode. Didn't somehow here suggest that you could use A13 rather than A12 and avoid the pattern table limitation with 8x16 sprites that MMC3 has?

<br />
<br />I personally think you can do the following on an inexpensive CPLD with 64 macrocells:
<br />
<br />- PRG ROM banking at 16K for 512K ROMS
<br />- RASTER counter, which works as a one-shot timer. No fancy extra registers, just write the value and BAM.
<br />- No VROM. Instead, use a cheap 32KB SRAM as VRAM the following way:
<br />    * 4K PPU Banking for EVERYTHING, dividing the PPU memory space in 4K segments which can contain one of the 8 VRAM banks. Which means, you can have multiple 4-screen nametables!
<br />
<br />This design could fit into an Altera 3064 CPLD in PLCC44 package. Perhaps maybe a little more (but just a little).

<br />
<br />So that's being on-topic for you... <img src="./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" />
<br />
<br />Yes, I was experimenting with the MMC3. And? How does that invalidate ANY of the things I have been saying in my previous threads? I just reiterate them for you:
<br />
<br />- A great mapper won't help you much in making a great game
<br />- People unable to make a fun game in NROM won't probably succeed with a MMC3 or better
<br />- The NES was popular because of it's breakthrough games. As a hardware platform, it never was any impressive, even back in 1983/85
<br />
<br />These are my claims here, and you guys are just being pissed off right now because you know they are true. That's exactly the reason you guys constantly feel the need to put words in my mouth I never claimed. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" />
<br />
<br />Besides, I figured out that what I did with the MMC3 could have easily been scaled down to a much more simple mapper. Many shitty games have been developed on the MMC3, and many of the best games on it could have been realised on a more simple mapper. Not because they exactly wasted the MMC3, but the fact that they are being great games because of their game design and idea.
<br />
<br />One of the VERY FEW games which REALLY use the MMC3 effciently for gameplay is Bucky O' Hare. For example, in the stages which have the screen full of horitontal scrolling platforms.
<br />
<br />Do I have to mention that Bucky O Hare is some kind of Konami's swan song for the NES, after almost a decade of NES experience and having released many great games on far simple mappers?
<br />
<br />Great, now you have seduced me to go back off-topic, after pointing the moral finger at me for derailing the thread. Naughty boy. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" />

<br />
<br />I don't think that anybody here are piss off because of that fact.  Great games can be made with or without a mapper and nobody is arguing against that.  
<br />
<br />The reason that many people are adding to this off topic argument is maybe more the tone that was used in the message regarding it.  To me, the way it was said was strong and didn't feel appropriate. This is more what I feel made people react than anything.  People react strongly on the nesdev forum for these kind of message.
<br />
<br />I think we are heading for a topic split and maybe this message will be the one.  What maybe you want to argument is more about what make a great game?  This is very subjective topic and everybody have their own opinion about it.
<br />
<br />For myself, if you come with a NROM 1 screen game or atari 2600 one and you will lose my interest right away.  Make some kind of platformer with a story, add a good sountrack with many songs with some nice <span class="posthilit">graphics</span> AND game play and you will start to get me interested (Ninja gaiden would be an example).
<br />
<br />I guess discussing about this subject would be more constructive than "a mapper doesn't make a game". Maybe some good argumentation could come out of it.
<br />
<br />Regarding my previous message, since the last message you wrote still felt not appropriate, I wrote very fast what I could call a "childish" message regarding the fact of showing by example make your argument stronger.  I should have not posted since it didn't bring must to that thread and I'm sorry about that.
<br />
<br />So, ready to talk about what makes a good game then?  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_lol.gif" alt=":lol:" title="Laughing" />

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Okay, I just figured something.
<br />The "problem" is that with no mapper at all, the NES is really very limited and that about 90% of NES games (I just throw this, don't take that nunber as accurate) are using a mapper.
<br />
<br />On platforms like the SNES where no mapper is the standard, everyone will be using no mapper unless they are doing complicated 3D stuff, so there is no real debate, a game will be using a mapper only if it would be impossible to make it without it.
<br />
<br />For the NES, this is really different because most popular games DOES use a mapper. Also, the mapper used are very varied and there is no real standard, only a list of standard. Taking one over another means sacrifices, and this is highly agruable. It is understandable that one do not want to make sacrifices in order to keep to a simpler mapper when there is no real reason to do so other than challenge.
<br />
<br />Altough, I'd say that you'd want to follow the rule "use the simplest mapper you need". That means that if you are not going to use most features of a mapper, you may as well not use that mapper and use a simpler instead. However, many effects can be achevied simply with a complex mapper or in a complex way on a simple mapper (the lack of a IRQ mapper will imply more complex sprite-zero hits and timed codes). So whenever you want to complicate your code or you mapper is up to personal choose, and nobody can answer to anyone whether it's good to complicate the software or the hardware.
<br />
<br />When it comes to programming on a powerfull system, honnestly, if I had the tools and the skill to make a PS3 game that looks pretty much like other PS3 games, I would do that instead and not bother with nesdev. Unfortunatlely I'm a bad graphist and I throught that developping for a system with "bad" <span class="posthilit">graphics</span> would make my chances to build a game at a similar level to others on the same platform higher. By "similar to others on the same platform", it implicitely says that it also use similar hardware, so no super mapper that is able to do aditiooonal things never seen before on the NES.
<br />
<br />Now people could be NESdeving for other reasons that I am, so it's some kind of personnal matter.

Many shitty games have been developed on the MMC3, and many of the best games on it could have been realised on a more simple mapper. Not because they exactly wasted the MMC3, but the fact that they are being great games because of their game design and idea.</div>
<br />
<br />Your first point is like most of your points, just some generalization. Making a fun game in NROM for one is harder to do than with a mapper because when you're limited to 32K PRG and 8K of CHR that severely limits what kind of game you can do. Don't bring up Super Mario Brothers because it is an exceptional game written by a professional company and god knows how long they spent making it. How about you mention some other NROM games that are as impressive? Or is that the only one you got? 
<br />
<br />I agree with part of what you are saying in the sense that someone probably shouldn't use MMC5 unless they really need it. Using the most common mapper for your needs certainly is the way to go. But it's not up to you to determine what they need. MMC3 is certainly what most people would prefer as the scanline counter is very desirable even if all you are doing is a status bar and maybe a few other effects with it. It's also very helpful if you need to bank smaller amounts of CHR for animation of BG or Sprites. 
<br />
<br />Your point about scaling down games makes no sense either. Ofcourse you could scale down just about anything but that's just stupid unless you have a good reason to do so. You know I think most of us wouldn't even care about Castlevania 3 if they had "scaled down" the game to do it as CNROM. 
<br />
<br />Basically I think you're acting elitist and putting people down. I'd certainly find your comments offensive if I was working on a NES project with the MMC3.
