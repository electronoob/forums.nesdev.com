<br />
<br />If I understand where the resistors are being used ie just the data lines, then the chip is still being enabled when it shouldn't be.  If the chip is still being enabled, then it will either write to the data bus or put whatever is on the data bus into memory. Filtering the data bus itself wouldn't prevent that. 
<br />
<br />Either we are generically using the word glitch for two different things or I'm still not following how that would prevent the corruption of memory.

<br />
<br />The symptoms were probably much different, but I'd bet it was the same problem.  The RAM on the emulator isn't exceptionally fast (70ns), but the bus is entirely buffered between the RAM/EPROM socket so I'd imagine it's those 74hc541 chips doing it.  It's kind of funny though, it never causes a crash, never uses sprite #0, it just semi-randomly / semi-permanently corrupts a sprite or 2 which makes me speculate that it may be a visible bus conflict, heheh.

<br />Whoops, poor reading comprehension on my part. Didn't notice the part about data lines only. Maybe it has something to do with ground glitches caused by the data lines all changing at the same time, glitches which aren't noticed by slow RAM chips, but are noticed by fast ones? The resistors would limit current, and thus reduce the glitches.

<br />No problem, I think I misunderstood Memblers as well.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Do these glitches happen on reads or writes? I'm thinking at least reads, because for example the PowerPak would be used almost always for reads from ROM. In that case, it would be the fast RAM chip's bus buffer driving the data bus, which has the capacitance of all the other chips on it. The fast RAM chip drives with more current, so it puts more load on the power bus. If it's not sufficiently decoupled, then I believe it'll see glitches on its inputs. This is a little beyond my experience, based on recent readings.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Yeah I could have worded it better, the series resistors just happened to work, everything else is just speculation.  Kevtris had built an FC-to-NES adapter with these series resistors, I believe that was to allow CopyNES to work with carts that would otherwise cause bus conflicts with the CopyNES hardware.  Luckily, that same adapter proved the fix.
<br />
<br />An R/C filter might not work either (on the /chip enable I mean), as it could be that the NES is starting the DMA before the previous memory access cycle is complete.  I guess the resistors then will limit the current so it doesn't become a major bus conflict.
<br />
<br />There's been a lot of times I wished there was a complete and accurate timing write-up and timing diagram of the full NES cart edge, much like IC datasheets have under "AC Characteristics".  2A03 must be just like the 6502, but with the Sprite-DMA, and DPCM, there's more to it.  I haven't tried (and don't know if I can except experimentally) derive the exact PPU timing, because currently and for a while previously I had been curious about exploiting the PPU's multiplexed address/data bus (yeah, so what if the ALE signal isn't brought out <img src="./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" />).

<br />My point was that you effectively get an R/C filter when you put a series resistor, as the CMOS input gate capacitance forms the C of the filter. But as elaborated above, I'm thinking it may be that the resistors reduce the slew rate and hence the current spike when changing logic levels.
