Hardwareman, do you know what the power draw of this would be like compared to Powerpak, more or less or about the same? My powerpak makes ugly jailbars compared to the same games on real cartridges on my RGB famicom.

Interface slightly modified, but still not yet the underlying list. You can now scroll the names manually, list management easier, as in the good old mnogoigrovkah.
