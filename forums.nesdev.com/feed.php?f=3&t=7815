This morning I was working on narrowing down a cheat code for Super Bat Puncher (hee hee hee :D :D :D).  Because Nestopia's "cheat helper" (for lack of better term) sucks, I decided to use FCEUXD SP's <a href="http://www.the-interweb.com/serendipity/index.php?/categories/9-FCEUXD-SP" class="postlink">RAM Filter</a>, which worked wonderfully.  Sure enough I was able to find what I wanted: messing around with ZP variables $D0 to $D9.  Entering these in the FCEUXD SP cheat section worked fine, voila.<br /><br />I then took the same address and value and brought it over into Nestopia as a permanent cheat code (using a 16-bit address, e.g. $00D0)... nothing.  Even re-examining the RAM contents inside of the cheat code editor confirmed that the address/value I chose was literally being ignored.  *blink blink*<br /><br />Then it hit me: maybe Nestopia is doing something weird with its address/value masking (overrides), where it's effectively limiting the addressing range to $8000-FFFF (PRG space)?  This would (for lack of better word) "mimic", in a way, <a href="http://tuxnes.sourceforge.net/gamegenie.html" class="postlink">how the Game Genie works</a>.<br /><br />I haven't looked at the Nestopia source code yet -- I've done so many times so that's not a limiting factor, but it takes a lot of time -- and I figured I'd ask here first.<br /><br />Has anyone had success using Nestopia's cheat system to overwrite values in ZP?<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3">koitsu</a> â€” Fri Jun 03, 2011 9:03 pm</p><hr />
