<br />
<br />Pay for credit cards?? Are you talking about the yearly fee, or interest on the credit? If you don't want a credit card, get a debit card. They work equally well for online payments, and the fee is like $10/year (at least in my bank).
<br />
<br />Besides, PayPal now allows you to transfer funds directly from a bank account to your PayPal account.

I got it free for this years when I turned 20, but I'll probably have to pay $100 per year to continue having it - which I don't want to since I only used it 2 times this year (and I'll use it a last time to order my super power pak).
<br />
<br />Of course I have a debit card but you can't make payments to outsider countries (or it's very complicated). But if it's possible to transfter funds directly from a bank account to PayPal then it would make the credit card even more pointless.

Some high-end credit cards with certain kinds of rewards have an annual fee, but ordinary credit cards make money for the bank on finance charges (i.e. interest). Debit cards sold as "gift cards" have an issue fee, but debit cards linked to a checking account or (in some countries) a PayPal account make money on loans that the bank makes using the money in the account. And both kinds of cards make money on the merchant fee.

<br />This is true for debit too, isn't it?
<br />
<br />I don't have a credit card, because if I can't see the number in my bank account lowering I end up spending more than I should (and I'm sure that's the whole point of credit cards), So I use only debit. However, I've never seen any options for using debit cards for international payments, so I usually have to borrow someone's credit card.
<br />
<br />It seems that PayPal recently opened a branch here in Brazil, so it should be easier to deal with them now (specially being able to transfer from and to a checking account).

<br />If your debit card has embossed numbers on the front and says "VISA" or "MasterCard" then it should work for any merchant that takes VISA or MasterCard cards. The PayPal debit card, for instance, has a MasterCard logo.

<br />Yeah, my card is like that. When I use my debit card "manually" I have to input a code into their machine thingy, how does that work online? Can they charge whatever they want just based on your card's number? This was scary enough with credit cards, but when the money comes off straight from your bank account it's even scarier.

<br />Right, my debit card is a VISA card, so I can use it anywhere. It just doesn't have any credit attached to it, so I can't spend money I don't have.
<br />
<br />Although I try to use my physical card only when I need to. For online purchases I use a service from my bank called "e-card". It's an application that generates virtual VISA cards where you can specify the maximum amount that can be charged on the card (ever), as well as how many months the card should be valid.
<br />It's a feature I definitely wouldn't want to be without.

<br />Yes. Banks aren't required to give as much fraud protection for debit card purchases as for credit card purchases, but they typically do to attract customers.

<br />It's not if they post the cash discounted prices alongside <em>every</em> normal price. So if a store has price tags on everything, these would have to list both prices. The main thing they really can't do is have a surcharge for cards; any price difference must be framed as a discount. Apparently buyers prefer not to have cash discounts, because they believe it implies higher prices and thus shop in places that lack the discount. I love my country.
