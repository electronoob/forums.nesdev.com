The actual game was released in NA as well(localized by ATLUS of course).  If you haven't played it yet, I strongly suggest you do so, It's so good, It's even better then the first Tactics Ogre game, which was great to begin with.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=4450">Zoltor</a> — Fri Jul 09, 2010 3:43 pm</p><hr />

I just got the Lawson Limited Deluxe Pack of Tactics Ogre: Knight of Lodis item(jp of course), so now I have both the Lawson edition, and the Famitsu Edition.<br /><br /><br />I'm usually not into collecting games, just to collect, but I so just had to have these(One of the best SRPGs ever made, and the bonus "wooden" display box is of such high quality, It's not funny), besides I do own a playing version of the game as well.<br /><br />This is the Famitsu Edition one: <br /><img src="http://i7.photobucket.com/albums/y296/Zoltor/Thecompletecontentsofthegameboxaswe.jpg" alt="Image" /><br /><img src="http://i7.photobucket.com/albums/y296/Zoltor/TheactualJPgamebox.jpg" alt="Image" /><br /><img src="http://i7.photobucket.com/albums/y296/Zoltor/OuterBoxandWoodenBox.jpg" alt="Image" /><br /><img src="http://i7.photobucket.com/albums/y296/Zoltor/OuterBoxback.jpg" alt="Image" /><br /><img src="http://i7.photobucket.com/albums/y296/Zoltor/OuterBox.jpg" alt="Image" /><br /><img src="http://i7.photobucket.com/albums/y296/Zoltor/WoodenBox.jpg" alt="Image" /><br /><img src="http://i7.photobucket.com/albums/y296/Zoltor/MedalTitlePlaquecloseup.jpg" alt="Image" /><br /><br />Note: Yes that's a Steel Name Plate.<br /><br />PS. I really don't have pictures of the Lawson Edition one, but the only Differance is the outer cardboard box says Lawson, and the Wood box is painted a different color.<br /><br />Also from what I recently learned from the Japanese person I bought the Lawson Eddition one from, there were only 1,000 made of each version, and they were pre-order only through magazines/website.<br /><br /><br />Wow, very restrictive on title legnth here, aren't you guys, yikes.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=4450">Zoltor</a> — Fri Jul 09, 2010 1:18 pm</p><hr />
