<br />
<br />If I watch the scroll lines in FCEUD, the cross hatch starts out on the far left. then if I start scrolling by incrementing a variable and writing that to $2005, the crosshatch moves to the rightmost edge of the screen.  But when the variable loops around to 0, the cross hatch does not move back to the far left but rather the center.
<br />
<br />the same thing happens when I try vertical scrolling
<br />
<br />am I totally missing something?  I tried checking out the "skinny" scrolling documents but I didn't really understand the difference between writing to $2006 vs $2005 for scrolling.

Also make sure you are performing the scroll writes during Vblank (or during the dummy scanline before ppu clock #304).  The top bits of 2000 also affect scrolling.

<br />
<br />I tried updating $2000 when the vertical scroll reaches $F0 but when I set it to $00, no matter what i set $2000 to, it still goes back to the halfway point, not the very top of the nametable
<br />
<br />also, I don't understand why the scroll will start out on the very far left and advance all the way across the screen, but then once it hits the right side, setting it to 0 only goes to the 1/2 way point.  what changes?
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />i will try to put together a small test case with some code
<br />
<br />
<br />edit:  LOL of course it works in my test case.. i'll see what i'm doing differently.  
<br />
<br />edit2: ug of course it doesn't work in the main program.  i think it has to do with the fact i'm updating the nametable at the same time

<br />PPUADDR=$2006 and PPUCTRL=$2000, right?
<br />
<br />ANYanyway:
<br />
<br />1)  You don't need to write to $2006 for scrolling.  In fact you shouldn't.  The only time you need to do that is if you're splitting the screen or turning the PPU on late.
<br />
<br />2)  once you finish with ALL of your drawing and are done with $2006/$2007, <em>then</em> write to $2000 and twice to $2005 to set the scroll
<br />
<br />3)  once the scroll is set, you cannot touch $2006/$2007 or else you will screw up the scroll.
<br />
<br />4)  The scroll must be set before rendering starts.  (dot 304 of the prerender line, iirc, is the cutoff time -- but ideally you'd have it done sooner than that)
<br />
<br />edit  - glad you hear you got it working!  ^^

There aren't very many of them, and if you refer to them directly, pretty much everyone will know what you're talking about. And then in your code if you write to one of them without using an alias, you'll know 100% what exactly is going on.

<br />
<br />tepples (I think) is a strong advocate of using those names.  So whatever -- I figured out what you meant, it just took a little bit of thought on my part because it's not what I'm personally used to.  Stick with whatever you're more comfortable with.

<br />
<br />It makes sense that emulator authors aren't as apt to use symbolic names for the register addresses, because they often have only two or three occurrences of each register's address in the entire program, whereas a NES program has tens or hundreds of references. Also, an emulator is usually in a high-level language, so they stand out, while in assembly, complexity is higher so anything that reduces the load on the programmer is good.

<br />
<br />Oh, please  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /> . It would actually be easier to spot register writes in your code if you use the raw addresses (at least I think). They stand out more, and they should as they should be rare compared to just writes to RAM. But that's just my opinion.

<br />That's what syntax coloring is for. But unfortunately, too many text editors come with presets that recognize only i386 syntax, not 6502 syntax.
<br />
<br />frantik: Your ideal is closer than some people might think, even on a 1.8 MHz 6502 at 60 frames per second. The only parts of an NES program that <em>need</em> to touch hardware are the init code, read_pads(), update_sound(), and copy_transfer_buffers_to_vram().
