While in the final game you'll have to beat the game to unlock it, here's a copy of Nova the Squirrel where the level studio in &quot;Extra features&quot; on the main menu is unlocked from the start so anyone who wants to try it out can. Requires an emulator supporting NES 2.0 like Mesen, as this game now uses SXROM (but will fallback fine if played as SNROM).<br /><br />This ROM also has other improvements over the previous build, mostly just adjusting music pitches and speed if played on a PAL console and some minor fixes.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3838">NovaSquirrel</a> — Wed Jan 02, 2019 5:23 pm</p><hr />

They already can. The game's source is on GitHub under a GPL license, as well as <a href="https://github.com/NovaSquirrel/PrincessEngine" class="postlink">a second repository</a> that was supposed to end up a more generic base you could start a platformer project from, and the PC level editor is very Lunar Magic inspired.<br /><br />It just turns out making tools isn't fun for me though, and doing lots of free tech support (if things got popular) sounds significantly less fun than that. Super Mario World's already filling that niche really well and the only thing I'd add if I spent all the necessary time to get things up to that level is just that your game would be legal to distribute which I don't think people care about too much.<br /><br />Maybe I'll write out a tutorial for using PrincessEdit at least. I'm hoping the in-game editor will be nice for people who just want a Mario Maker-esque experience too.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3838">NovaSquirrel</a> — Tue Dec 25, 2018 2:01 am</p><hr />

What would really be cool in my opinion is to make a Lunar Magic like program to edit your Nova the squirrel game and allow people to use it an order to make new homebrews for the nes. Using Nova as a game engine or some sort. <br /><br />It could be free or paid, whatever works for you. I got NESmaker, but I don't like making all of my own assets. I just want to drag and drop stuff into a level and play it. <br /><br />Of course these are just my thoughts.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=6785">Erockbrox</a> — Mon Dec 24, 2018 8:09 pm</p><hr />

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/7H6b2ZM.gif" alt="Image" /><br />I'm expanding the level sandbox into a full level editor, which will just launch into the old sandbox if it detects SNROM instead of SXROM. Right now you can save and load four level slots and you can change the level layouts in an environment where you can go from block placing to/from playing immediately.<br /><br />I'm gonna try to add sprite placement next. I'm trying to think of a way to take advantage of big CHR RAM but I can't think of anything except making unpausing faster, because as-is it has to decompress everything again. Probably not going to pull a SMB2 here.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3838">NovaSquirrel</a> — Sun Dec 23, 2018 11:57 am</p><hr />

Oh, I forgot to add. <br /><br />Possibly this is why Super Mario World hacking has a big following:<br /><br />- Super Mario World was a popular game many people played so it has a (fan base)<br />- It is easy to make and play SMW hacks<br />- There is a website dedicated to editing the game<br />- There are lots of free tools and resources that anyone can use<br />- All of the hacks are free to play<br /><br /><br />I want to put an emphasis on the FREE aspect of this hacking scene. Everything is essentially FREE. This means that the entry bar so to speak is very low. Anyone can download the tools and get started right away. Even non-hackers can download and enjoy playing the games. Let's say that you have some kids in intermediate school (before high school) and they don't have jobs yet so they don't have much money, SMW hacking might be ideal to them. You don't need a high end computer to run the software and you don't even need to own the actual original hardware or a clone console. You can run it all with an SNES emulator on your laptop.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=6785">Erockbrox</a> — Sun Jul 08, 2018 10:27 pm</p><hr />
