Longer paths can most definitely cause unwanted resistance, but lidnariq's explanation sure makes a hell of a lot of sense too.  Maybe better shielded wire would have given better results.<br /><br />-Rob<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=200">rbudrick</a> — Fri Aug 08, 2008 12:19 pm</p><hr />

That's what I was looking for. Thanks for the info!<br /><br />Something else I neglected to mention is that I went from 100 ohms in my first mod, up to 220 (not too different from the Game Genie's 200), and then back down to 100. But since it's working now, I guess it doesn't matter too much... <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" /><p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=935">BMF54123</a> — Wed Aug 06, 2008 12:58 pm</p><hr />

If this were running faster, I'd blame impedance mismatch, since that 100 ohm resistor would do stupid things to the characteristic impedance of the transmission lines. But it's not running at ~30MHz (where this would start to become an obvious issue), it's running at ~2. (~5 if this is the PPU bus, I haven't looked closely at a powerpak)<br /><br />My best guess the extra length of wire allowed capacitive coupling between adjacent lines, and/or the little loops of wire served as inductors, so there would be momentary glitches as voltages changed -- one wire would exceed the rails or cause another wire to momentarily go to an invalid (or wrong) voltage. (both of these could cause crashes) When you switched to the floppy cable, you probably actually increased the amount of coupling because they were all now neatly parallel.<br /><br />Normally, low speed digital systems don't care about these kind of issues, but normally you don't have 100 ohm resistors in the middle of your wires, either.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3512">lidnariq</a> — Wed Aug 06, 2008 8:35 am</p><hr />

Ever since I performed the resistor fix on my PowerPak, I've had intermittent card read errors and game crashes. My original fix <a href="http://rustedmagick.com/misc/powerpakmod.png" class="postlink">looked like this,</a> since I wasn't very confident in my ability to solder resistors directly between the resistor array and edge connector. I updated the mod slightly a few months back, using a shorter section of floppy cable instead of individual wires, but the card errors and crashes only became more frequent and severe. I was at the end of my rope, ready to send the thing back to bunnyboy, until I decided to try my hand at soldering the resistors directly to the edge connector, out of sheer curiosity. Lo and behold, the mod went off without a hitch, and the PowerPak is working almost flawlessly now--no card errors or crashes (aside from those caused by buggy mapper logic)!<br /><br />So, now I'm curious--what was wrong with my previous fixes? They used the same resistors, connected to the same points, just with a longer circuit path. Could the wires have introduced interference, or perhaps slight timing problems due to their length? Why was I getting crashes when the original problem was only supposed to affect sprite DMA? I'm in no way an electronics expert, so some insight on this issue would be appreciated. <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=935">BMF54123</a> — Tue Aug 05, 2008 10:19 pm</p><hr />
