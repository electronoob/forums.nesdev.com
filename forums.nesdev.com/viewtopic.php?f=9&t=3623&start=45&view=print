I'm not a fan of RPGs at all and never have been, the only RPG I ever really enjoyed was Chrono Trigger and thats just because its so well put together, I believe GamePro gave it 5's across the board when it first came out.  I have not noticed a sprite not animating right on any of the games I've played, all glitches and even the flickering seems to be exactly the same as a real NES, the one exception is areas that cause slowdown on a real NES can be a bit more slowed down, but it actually helps you because it gives you a "The Matrix" effect.  Also, that HD TV analogy is completely off base, a more accurate analogy would be that the colors are 2 shades lighter than a "standard" HD TV and 6 out of 750 channels don't come in, including the bowling channel, the watch paint dry channel, the deep fat fryer channel, QVC, among others that aren't worth the time of day.  Honestly, if there was such an HD TV as the one I just described and it was significantly cheaper than a used regular HD TV and "original" HD TVs couldn't be purchased new, I would probably buy it.  So, actually, the HD TV analogy makes the clones look even better.
<br />
<br />Just to reiterate, I'm not here to argue over if clones are better than a real NES, or even if they are a better alternative to a used one, I'm just wondering about why certain things on the clone are the way they are out of sheer curiousity, don't get bent out of shape over it.

<br />no, there were like 4 or 5 PSX games that weren't compatible with PS2, though I can't remember which ones they were, I think most of them (or all of them) were Japanese-only releases, but there definitely were some, I remember reading about it in a magazine.

It is same gen, same architecture, not software emulation.  It would be like the slim PS2 not playing 5-10% of the PS2 games library, while changing every color and many sounds on all the other games.  You personally may not notice or care about those changes, but I am only looking at the technical not the opinion.  When the entire screen is different, that is not flawless.  You could say it is flawfull, or awful for short  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" /></div>
<br />
<br />Actually, now that you mention it, the slimline isn't 100% compatible with PS2 games (ha!).  The PS2 hard drive doesn't have a place to attach to the slimline, therefore you can't play Final Fantasy XI (11) because it needs the hard drive, and thats a "critically acclaimed super awesome mega fantastic" game, and I'm sure it beats the pants off of any of the NES RPGs.  Also, the first shipment of PS2s weren't compatible with dual layer DVD's so Sony had to replace them when it was discovered that Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas wouldn't play on them (and I'm sure other games since). In Japan, there are even more games that require the hard drive so you lose about...5-6 licensed games, JUST LIKE THE FAMICLONES!  Not trying to be a dick here, just pointing out my comparison was accurate.

Yes a few games don't work, there are a couple games that won't work on the real NES top loader like NWC.  But you are still glossing over the almost 100% inaccuracy of the NOAC video, and the 20% (random guess, 2 of 5 parts from 2 of 5 channels?) audio inaccuracy in every game which is the whole reason many people say NOACs are cheap junk.  <br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">17daysolderthannes wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">you can't play Final Fantasy XI (11)</div>
<br />And using your logic, I hate all Final Fantasy games so that one doesn't count no matter how good it is!  Dragon Warrior 1 forever!

Can't talk about compatibility while ignoring games because you don't like them, or features because you don't notice them.  Inaccuracy is technical, quality is opinion.  Around here I care about the technical, so even Cheetahmen 2 is important.

<br />
<br />I know I shouldn't feed the troll, but if you really are "17 days older than the NES"  (what, born in 1986 or so?) you probably never played any of these games "back in the day" so you aren't tuned to the finer points of the games.   If you've played them on the real system for hours on end, you will instantly notice the problems with the clones.
<br />
<br />Besides, if cheetahmen 2 doesn't work, what will I pop in to my NES to get about 5 minutes of solid laughter?  It's so terrible it's hilarious.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />how exactly am I trolling? I asked technical questions and got a mix of technical and opinionated responses, so I said "thanks" for the technical responses and offered my counter opinion to the opinions.  Honestly, the whole term "Sound Accuracy" is subjective anyway.  Accurate with respect to what?  With respect to a regular NES, yes, it is not exactly the same.  But like the NES is really an amazing piece of audio technology to begin with.  Take for instance Ghostbusters or Ghostbusters 2 on the NES, it plays an instrumental version of the ghostbusters theme the whole game.  Comparing accuracy to the real audio from the movie, its "cheap innaccurate garbage" and in fact could be closer to the real thing on a clone system (dunno, I don't own the game to try it).  Yes, technically the sound is not identical to an NES, and if that bugs you then clones are not for you, but I have actually come to prefer some games on the Yobo such as Rush N Attack because I find the drums sound more like drums instead of the bleep/bloop sounds of the NES and give it a more mature sound.  None of the games I've played have sound that gives off a "garbled" feel, just a different one, and in some games I find its a better alternative.
<br />
<br />oh, and as for my name, I am 17 days older than the original launch of the US NES: October 18, 1985, aka I was born October 1,1985 (I thought you should know that since you are a contributing member of a site dedicated to developing for the NES).  I got my first NES when I was 4~5 years old (I still haven't been able to pin down exactly how old I was) and didn't "upgrade" to an SNES until I was 9 or 10 or maybe even 11, so that gave me a solid 5 years of strictly NES playing, back when I was a kid with no responsibilities and hours to sit in front of a TV.  In fact, usually when I would go to a friend's house and they had an NES, the first thing I did was see what games he had and ask to play/borrow one if it was one I didn't have or hadn't played before.  All of the kids were like that at the time, NES was the only "toy" anyone cared about (though it is much better than a toy, hence the quotations).  Hell, I even had a baby sitter that taught me and my sister all of the tricks like warp pipes in Super Mario Bros.  Even with all of that history with the NES, I still am not bothered by the slight differences of the clone, but thats probably because I tend to look at stuff like this from the optomists standpoint: new console with very high compatability rather than the pessimists standpoint: not exactly the same as an original and not perfect compatability, therefore useless.  The most baffling thing to me is that all of you seem to absolutely hate clones for their inaccuracy, yet you develop emulators that are far less accurate and pat each other on the back.  Give credit where credit is due, they did a decent job for what it is, not to hate on emulator developers, by all means keep up the good work, I was content with emulators years ago when they were full of bugs, but just giving my perspective on the matter.  If the NOAC was a homebrew accomplishment, forum upon forum would be saturated with people saying "ZOMG, AWESOME!" and "PLEASE MASS PRODUCE THIS, I WANT ONE!"

Accurate emulators like Nintendulator are FAR better than the NOACs which should be expected because the problems are actually fixed.  They even correctly emulate the bugs/quirks of the original NES.  MMC5 games have run correctly for a couple years.  People like kevtris have physically measured the video voltages so they can be simulated correctly.  There are even blarggs NTSC libraries to display the tv artifacts and pixel blurring.  These good emulators are even better than the official Nintendo ones on GBA/Wii/etc  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />  If you were content with Nesticle thats fine, but its pretty much blasphemy around here!  So many problems now are created from the bad info then...<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">17daysolderthannes wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">If the NOAC was a homebrew accomplishment, forum upon forum would be saturated with people saying "ZOMG, AWESOME!" and "PLEASE MASS PRODUCE THIS, I WANT ONE!"</div>
<br />Which is exactly what has happened with the truly 100% accurate <a href="http://tripoint.org/kevtris/Projects/console/index.html" class="postlink">kevtendo</a>.  It even plays Cheetahmen 2 <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />  Unfortunately it is still too expensive to produce in the small quantities of people that would actually pay for it.  There are ways to make it cheaper but his ambitions go way farther than just a NES.

If its really THAT good, that makes me want to go through with my "emulation station" idea where I build a custom PC just to emulate NES, SNES, Genesis, N64, and a couple other systems that grab my interest and just buy an A/V converter so it can be used on a tv (I believe its part of the video card, correct? I haven't looked into it much, just know it exists).  That way, with RetroUSB.com's adapters, I can play the entire library of each system with original controllers all in one convenient device without having to even change cartridges.  Although, isn't this possible already with XBOX/Gamecube? maybe that would be the cheaper way since XBOXs are dirt cheap and technically already have a Gamecube (Wii).

<br />
<br />the xbox has ports of quite a few emulators. the fceu port to xbox is a dated version (from ~2004 i beleive) and some of the more obscure mappers aren't supported. though from your earlier post, you probably wouldn't care about a few pirate games anyways.
<br />
<br />then there's the problem that xbe's built with the xdk are illegal to distribute, but that'd be a personal issue.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />While I am forced to emulate 98/XP for specific apps, I am certainly a Mac guy  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />  Nestopia and FCEU are both available for Mac OS X.  I haven't looked at RockNES in over 3 years, and I now see Bannister's version is now discontinued.  It is at least a full version behind anyways.  If you are on an Intel Mac you can run the Windows NES emulators at almost full speed in Parallels, or full speed in Bootcamp.  There really is no Mac NES emulator with a debugger so I run the Windows ones (FCEUXD SP, Nintendulator) in Parallels all the time.  VirtualPC for PPC Macs still works good for emulators because there isn't too much video usage.
<br />
<br />Emulation station, or a MAME cabinet, is a good idea that many people have done.  However using an xbox is a bad idea.  They purposely broke the USB spec to collect more royalties so generic gamepads like at retrousb.com will not work.  Better to spend the money for a super cheap computer so you get easier internet/music/movie playing too.  
<br />
<br />The Mac Mini is more expensive than a full sized super cheap Windows box, but it is a great choice because of its size, silence, and video output.  It will run any Windows app that doesn't use 3D rendering with no problems.  I have one in the kitchen for music for my wife, it also runs a CounterStrike server and home automation stuff.  It is small enough that everything is build into the cabinets.  Finally got the amazingly small bluetooth keyboard too  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />

<br />
<br />there are still ways to get GC homebrew runnning on the Wii altough if this is your interest you better off with an xbox sence, things can be much more easally ported to xbox sence it basicley just an intel PC  there are many  better emulators already ported to it for a large range of systems, it can run real linux and with xbox media center it make one hell of a media player witch can play almost any digital media and it has a hard drive to store all of this on witch can be replaced with a larger one, with a xerc installed and a RCA DVD remote its hard to beat
<br />
<br />@ bunnyboy:
<br />I feel the xbox is more usefull for a TV hookup general media use than a cheap PC
<br />these things cannot be understood till you already own a "hacked" xbox or spend some time with one and see all of its meny uses I think it would do you some good to spend one afternoon reading <a href="http://www.xbox-scene.com/" class="postlink">here</a> there is a LOT more too it than you would think
<br />
<br />anyway it dose not seem to be productive to argue with 17daysolder sence you ether get it or you dont and he will never get it

<br />This isn't an argument, unless you are just trying to start another troll by saying he is stubborn  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />  He just either hasn't been around long enough or hasn't taken the time to see what else is out there.  Education is usually productive.  Even I learned why Paperboy doesn't work because he started this...
