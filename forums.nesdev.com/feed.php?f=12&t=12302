I haven't seen anything for stack use that couldn't have been done another way (with the same amount of effort), outside my own convoluted use for such things (making BRA.long macro for code that has all relative branch, allowing it to work in different cpu logical address locations) - but that also hasn't seemed to deter devs from doing it (macros maybe?

I watched a video about compiler optimizations, and according to the video, compilers divide code into &quot;basic blocks&quot; where it never jumps.<br /><br />In order to pad a basic block, you can insert a NOP at the end if there is one byte left.

That won't help if code elsewhere jumps somewhere in the middle of that subroutine (incidentally, IDA tends to get confused by this since it makes it hard to tell what are the real subroutine boundaries).

The problems with things like this are, if you got rid of even one LDA, wouldn't it offset the entire game and cause pointers to go to the wrong place and mess everything up? I guess you could write NOP, but that still takes up 2 clock cycles. The only real non-crazy way to do something like this that I can think of would be if you had the source code, but I'm sure that even the developers haven't kept track of it...<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=6683">Espozo</a> — Thu Feb 12, 2015 5:34 pm</p><hr />

Tepples also pointed out the larger issue, which is the <strong>halting problem</strong>.  Computers are pretty poor at making decisions based on examining code.  Optimizing compilers, for example, work well because the programming &quot;rules&quot; of C forbid the programmer to write outside of defined variables, arrays, etc., so the optimizer knows (well enough) what data/variables never get used in the code and can eliminate them.<br /><br />With assembly code on the (S)NES, it's a free-for-all, and code can jump or read/write anywhere, anytime, and this <em>is</em> the rule built into the assembly instructions.  Software can't catch all possibilities, only emulate the code and show hotspots, etc to the user, and mmaybe suggest optimizations.  The implementation would still be up to the programmer to do.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=355">ccovell</a> — Thu Feb 12, 2015 4:07 pm</p><hr />

I think if you want to optimize a game to reduce or eliminate slowdown you are better off manually trying to do so. Any automated program for such a thing is likely to do a poorer job compared to a person that knows the whole picture, or atleast the bigger picture. I don't think there would be a one size fits all solution for optimizing these sorts of games. If you want something more like that I think you just need to look into overclocking the CPU or otherwise getting more CPU time. On an emulator it could be done more easily ofcourse.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=1726">MottZilla</a> — Thu Feb 12, 2015 2:25 pm</p><hr />
