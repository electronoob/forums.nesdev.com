<br />The feature was designed for mappers that represent boards with hardwired traditional mirroring (NROM, C*ROM, U*ROM, BNROM, GNROM/MHROM, Color Dreams, and Namco's predecessor of MMC3). If a specific mapper always powers on in vertical mirroring mode, all ROMs for that mapper should have the mirroring bit in the header set to vertical.

<br />From your original post I thought you meant that iNES header mirroring should define the powerup state of mirroring even for mappers that have hardware controllable mirroring. I'm still not sure if that's what you meant or not... I wouldn't call hardwired mirroring "power-on state of mirroring registers".

<br />
<br />Nestopia only loads the first 256KB of PRG-ROM, so I had to make a seperate image just for it. Needless to say it is the least compatible emulator <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />
<br />
<br />@memblers,
<br />
<br />I understand your concerns. Perhaps a better road to take would be to support several different mappers on one cart. We could have a "stock" FME-7, an FME-7 with 2048KB ROM using a sub-mapper and a custom mapper with a totally unique mapper number. That would seem to satisfy all sides of the emulator compatibility split, and it could easilly be done in a single package.
<br />
<br />I like this line of though. Progressive super-sets of the same mapper, each with differing levels of emulator support and cost of production boards. Thank you very much for the challange!
<br />
<br />@3gengames,
<br />
<br />512 KB of PRG-RAM is the most that the register setup of the FME-7 will allow. The real mapper only supported 8. 256 KB of CHR-ROM is the max for the origional mapper and the register space.

<br />Also, the design will not fit into a $5 144 cell chip. It comes in at 152 cells. I've done what I can to try and reduce this, but without much experience I am not sure of what I can and cannot do. This will be a major issue for production boards as the next step up chip is $15, or we would have to use a chip from a different family that would need 5V level translation on the inputs.

<br />
<br />$15 for the mapper chip is prohibitively expensive for a production cart (in my view anyhow).
<br />
<br />I am now investigating using iNES Mapper 67 (Fantasy Zone II). It has the following features:
<br />
<br />* One 16 KB PRG bank at $8000
<br />* One 16 KB Fixed PRG bank at $c000
<br />* Four 2 KB CHR banks at $0000, $0800, $1000 and $1800
<br />* Mapper-controlled name table mirroring: H, V, 1SCA and 1SCB
<br />* CPU cycle-counting IRQ, 16-bit
<br />* No provisions for WRAM, although I'll hack in a backwards-compatible WRAM protect register
<br />* No provisions for CHR-RAM
<br />* All mapper functions are single-write operations, meaning they are atomic by default
<br />
<br />This will be a fun project I think <img src="./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" />
<br />
<br />A quick survey of popular (and semi-popular) PC-based NES emulators shows that most support iNES Mapper 67 (as used by Fantasy Zone 2). Jnes, FakeNES and Nesticle do not support this mapper at all. The others at least displayed the title screen.
<br />
<br />Also, if you haven't tried Fantasy Zone 2 and you have the means to do so, please do! It's a surprisingly fun game. It's Defender, Gradius and Clash at Demonhead all crammed into one adorable package <img src="./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" />

<br />
<br />From the hardware perspective that is all that is required. From the emulator perspective the emulator must be flexible enough to see that there is no CHR-ROM defined and create an 8 KB RAM array to use as the CHR-RAM. Lots of emulators do not do that for FME-7.
<br />
<br />Honestly what lead me to this mapper is that I am trying to create an 8-way scrolling engine using UNROM, but I wanted to use one-screen mirroring. On hardware I could do all sorts of things, like tie the 8th output of an 8-bit latch to the CIRAM /A10 line, or just tie it directly to GND, but none of this will work on an emulator <img src="./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" />
<br />
<br />I think this is a good compromise. It provides more functionality that any of the discreet mappers or MMC1, yet will (probably) still fit into an affordable CPLD for production carts.

My current "mapper of choice" is mapper 2, so this would really feel like a direct upgrade. I don't even miss the WRAM, but if you want to add it, even better.
<br />
<br />The good thing about bankswitching CHR-ROM in 2KB chunks is that you can have a total of 512KB of it, which somewhat compensates for the repeated tiles that will inevitably be there because of background animations and such.
<br />
<br />I don't see any real problem with the cycle counter... Any error you get from successive IRQs is still much smaller than the errors you'd get with DMC IRQs... Seriously, you guys are worrying to much about this. I'm pretty sure it would take several splits for this little timing error to accumulate enough to cause visual glitches. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LmQkFQ7kGE#t=1m08s" class="postlink">Batman: Return of the Joker appears to split the screen several times in a frame without problems.</a>

<br />We've already discussed this. We want to finally break free from having to destroy existing carts in order to make new ones. Also, the scanline counter on the MMC3 imposes some limitations on how we can use the pattern tables, limitations that homebrewers would rather not have (well, pretty much only me for now, but I'm sure others will be glad in the future! <img src="./images/smilies/icon_lol.gif" alt=":lol:" title="Laughing" />).
