<br />
<br />Note: The reason I didn't provide a direct link is because it actually took me a little while to figure out how to get it 'installed' so I put a video tutorial on the page on how to do it.

I ended up hacking out my own, due to a need for seeing a totally black background. I've tried to use the global overrides but they don't usually look nice with built in language definitions or others' definitions.
<br />
<br />One thing that I wish Notepad++ would do is add a feature where when you open a .asm file, your user-defined highlighter is used instead of the built in one. As far as I know there is no way to do this.

<br />Don't ask me what I did, but my Notepad++ highlights 6502 code in files with the "asm" extension automatically. I believe there I specified the extension(s) somewhere...

All I did was go into I think view/user-defined-dialogue, and I did associate it with ".asm, " but so far npp still opens the default asm language. Did you actually replace the default one with your own or..?

<br />
<br />For now I'm using Notepad++ but if my prototype for my ca65 text editor goes well, I may use it less for 6502 coding.  The current concept is to allow syntax highlighting, pull down with name of symbols/function for finding them, suggestion for name based on the symbols defined in your code etc.
<br />
<br />If it become more than a prototype, I may post it someday. For now I can only work only a few minutes per day during lunch time so I'm not expecting anything for a while.  I have a few other ideas but unless I can make them work, I won't mention them yet.
