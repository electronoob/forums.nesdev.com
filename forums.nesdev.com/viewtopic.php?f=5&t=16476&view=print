		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />The NES/Famicom already has keyboards, disk drives, network adapters, flash carts that can read/write from/to memory cards... so yeah, the hardware is already there. If you want to use it for game development, all you need is the software. You'll never have an assembler as complex as the ones we have running on modern computers, but a barebones assembler is certainly possible. Some tile drawing tools already exist.<br /><br />I don't know why anyone would choose a more limited development environment when more versatile options are available, though...

They don't list it on their own website.<br /><br />I'd be surprised if there was any useful software that came with it, other than bootleg games though.  I doubt there's even a way to save data (though a FlashROM-based cart should be able to do it).  Might be worth asking them for details, but prepare to be disappointed.  Supposedly $6 each, but 1000 pieces minimum order...

It also comes with various productivity software, like a word processor, a spreadsheet, and even a debugger for debugging your homebrew right on the unit. You could even connect it to a PC to have it access the files on your hard drive (for rapid testing if you're developing on a PC). <br />I was really impressed when I found out about this clone, it's way better than the usual junk you get out of China.
