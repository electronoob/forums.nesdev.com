		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I can understand how to install a H/V mirroring switch on a devcart, but since I don't like to let learning opportunities go by, I really want to understand why that kind of mirroring control is possible.
<br />
<br />What I don't get is, what do the address lines that connect to the CHR-ROM chip have to do with the name tables? You get what I'm saying? I can't see what the pattern tables could possibly have to do with the name tables...
<br />
<br />If anyone can clear that up for me, I'd be very grateful. Thanks for the help.

Connecting it to CHR A11 will make A10 "don't care" and since the bit is shifted up, NT0 is selected through $2000-27FF while NT1 is $2800-2FFF instead of $2000-23FF and $2400-27FF.

<br />
<br />And yeah it is the same address lines as the pattern table, but there are separate chip enables for pattern and nametables.  Like on Squeedo I keep the NES's VRAM disabled always, and if you wanted to for some reason, you could select the highest CHR-RAM bank to be pattern table and nametables at the same time.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />It makes more sense now, since I know that these address lines are shared... but I'm still a bit confused. Not much about mirroring, I'm cool knowing that those address lines are also used for the name tables, but something else.
<br />
<br />The CHR chip is disabled when memory over $1FFF is read, so that the data can come from the name tables (memory inside the NES) instead, right?
<br />
<br />So, A12 would define if memory over $1FFF is being read (if A12 = 1 then address &gt;= 8192) but /A13 is used for /CE? I don't get it... Why A13? And if the "/" means "inverted", if addresses over $3FFF were being accessed, the inverse of A13 would be 0... 0 into /CE would mean that the chip would be <strong>enabled</strong> when acessing memory over $3FFF? That's messed up... I must be sleepy or something, because that makes no sense!
<br />
<br />Please guys, tell me how A13 relates to CE, or I'll go crazy trying to figure this out.
<br />
<br />And Memblers, how do you manage to disable the NES's VRAM?
<br />
<br />If I had a CHR-RAM chip on a cart, and it was larger than 8KB would it be simple to also use it for 4-screen mirroring then? just curious...
<br />
<br />I guess the bottom line is: how does the NES know where to get the data from? Is it all done by just by enabling/disabling chips? How exactly is that set up? How do you specify if the name/attribute table data comes from the NES's VRAM or from the cart?
<br />
<br />Thanks a lot for clearing this up!
<br />
<br />EDIT: Sorry guys, my bad. I see now that A13 really is the bit that when set means that memory over $1FFF is being read. But I'm still confused about "/A13" being used as "/CE", mainly because of the "/".

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I believe /A13 gets inverted before entering the CHR chip as /CE.
<br />
<br />The cart can disable internal VRAM by forcing VRAM /CE high.  Normally CHR /A13 is passed untouched through to the NES as VRAM /CE, but a cart can filter this behavior when the PPU address is within a certain range.  I think some carts disable internal VRAM completely and maintain all 4 nametables in 4K of VRAM loaded on the cart.
<br />
<br />I see no reason why you can't use a larger CHR-RAM chip to hold nametable data along with CHR data, as long as you use proper address decoding.

<br />The / just means it's A13 inverted.

<br />Yeah, I get that. What confuses me is that the CE signal is also inverted.
<br />
<br />so, when accessing address $2000, for example, A13 is 1. When inverted, it becomes 0. And then, 0 goes into /CE of the chip, and if 0 is "false", inverted it would become true, meanign that the chip would be enabled when accessing that memory. That's what doesn't make sense.
<br />
<br />Unless 0 into /CE means that the chip is to be disabled, but that doesn't make sense, sice I'v seen people connect GND (0) to /CE before and the chips work.
<br />
<br />Seriously, what am I missing here?
<br />
<br />One more question about A13: In the case of mappers that do CHR bankswitching, /A13 is not directly connected to the chip, right? I mean, you have to be able to read memory over $1FFF, but the mapper takes care of mapping it to below that space. Is that correct? I'm asking because the pinouts of the CHR chips found on the nesdev page say that /A13 is conected to the chips, even the larger ones.

<br />
<br />That is correct - by connecting PPU /A13 to VRAM /CE, you cause VRAM to be enabled for $2000-$3FFF. PPU A13 typically gets connected to CHR ROM|RAM /CE, which enables it for $0000-$1FFF.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />'VRAM' is a synonym of 'CHRRAM'.
<br />
<br />On my understanding, the adresses on PPU bus are NOT the same as acedded from $2006, acutally A13 is toggled for some reason. So, $0000-$0fff become the name table space, and $2000-$3fff pattern table space. /CE is usually active low, but on some 8kb SRAMs there is a CE active high input, so I don't know.
<br />To use 4-screen mirroring, you could just lazily put some 32kb RAM chip on the cart and leave CIRAM /CE high. That will get 8kb of CHRRAM and 4 name tables in the same chip. The PPU will never write or read anything in the range $1000-$1fff, so I think it's okay. If you wan't CHRROM, or if you just don't like being lazy and wasting the power of chips, you can use a '139 style decoder to get your own 2kb chip used for nametable 0 and 1, and the CIRAM chip for the nametables 2 and 3 (or any combination in that style). I think some '00 NAND gates can do the decoding also.
<br />The typical way official carts does it is keep a whoel 8kb SRAM chip on the board (like for CHRRAM), but just have A13 disabling it instead of /A13. Also, it's a good idea to put A12 to ground instead to A12, because you never known when $1000-$1fff could be acessed (there is palette RAM mirored in $1f00-$1fff, remember, so it would be bad to have anyother device on the bus at that time).
<br />
<br />Actually, there is thousands of other possibilities. You could get funky 3-screen mirroring, or do nametable bankswitching, or use CHRROM as nametable data, or whathver. Anything is allowed, since the cart has acess to the whole CHR bus.
<br />
<br />You could even have a cart with no CHROM nor CHRAM at all, and have only ROM. If you tie for example CIRAM /CE to ground and CIRAM A10 to CHR A13, you'll definitely get one screen mirroring and no opportunity to have more than one nametable, and have 1kb of CHRRAM mirrored 8 times trough the pattern table. That would only allow 64 tiles to be used at one time. This could be done for very plain games on a cartridges, and prices could be lower by this technique to have no CHR chip at all !

<br />Because the Nintendo ROM doesn't have a +CE pin - it has a /CE pin which is connected to A13. /A13 <strong>is not used</strong> for CHR ROM (only nametable RAM), which is why I said that said document is <strong>wrong</strong>.

<br />Ahh... that makes a hell lot more sense! If A13 (no "/") is responsible for disabling the CHR chip and /A13 is responsible for disabling nametable RAM, everything is OK!
<br />
<br />The problem is that I, as a humble hardware newbie, have to belive in the documents avaliable, and am not always able to spot these errors.
<br />
<br />Thanks for clearing that up. It's such a simple answer ("actually, A13 is connected to /CE on the CHR chip, not /A13") that I wonder why no one said that before.
