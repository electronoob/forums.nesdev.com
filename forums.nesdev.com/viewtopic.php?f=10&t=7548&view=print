		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Hello
<br />I recently aquired a nice pirate famicom cartridge with lots of different games, but some of them had garbled graphics.. So I took the cartridge and preheated all the contacts on the back side. Some of the games are now working flawlessly, but not all of them. So I'm thinking that some of the ICs on the board are bad and need replacement. There is no problem replacing the 74 670, 74 174 or 74 273 but there is also a "programmable array IC" named PAL16L8 and I need help with it...
<br />Is there a way to find out how is the array programmed? And if I know that, how can I programm such a device? I have a programmer <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.elnec.com/products/device-programmers/preprom-02alv">http://www.elnec.com/products/device-pr ... prom-02alv</a><!-- m --> but I'm not sure if this device can be programmed with it. 
<br />Here is a very bad scan of the cartridge:

<br />
<br />Can anyone please help me with it? I was googling a bit but with no luck so far...

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Your programmer does not support PALs but it supports some newer replacements--PALCE, PEEL and GAL. If it did, you could try reading out the fusemap of the chip, then programming the logic into one of the above. Most likely though even if your programmer supported PALs, the PAL would be protected from reading as its a common practice. Your only real choice would be to brute force the logic out of it, and that's a pretty complicated process for all but the simplest of designs. This doesn't really matter though since if the PAL is damaged you aren't going to be able to replace it by copying its logic to another device anyway.
<br />
<br />Take pictures of the garbled graphics, that should indicate whether it's bad mirroring or wrong tiles from failed bankswitching or corrupt tiles from bad ROM contacts. In this cart the PAL controls mirroring, but it also decodes for the other chips so surely it's not very broken or nothing would work.

<br />Well that's new... and I thought that it would be an easy task. 
<br />
<br />Since I already desoldered 74 670, 74 174 and 74 273 and ordered the *670 because no shop in town has it, I must wait till friday to solder new ones back and if there will still be garbled graphics, I'll photograph the screen and post some pictures. 
<br />(From what I remember, in Twin Bee, there was something like a static in the upper part of the screen very unusual, no weird geometric shapes, just "scratches" from one side to another. The same was at SMB before preheating, but it dissapeared after that. But in Formation Z, there were garbled sprites, square shapes throughout the whole screen in the color of the current palette.)
<br />
<br />Thank you very much so far, I will be back on friday (hopefully the IC will arrive till then).
<br />
<br />EDIT: still no luck getting the 74*670, I should have ordered it from Hong Kong, would have been here already..  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_evil.gif" alt=":evil:" title="Evil or Very Mad" />

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Finally my <strong>74HC670</strong> arrived, so I exchanged all ICs that were replaceable on the board, but with no luck. So I prepared a presentational website with all problematic games shown:
<br /><span style="color: olive">-removed from my page to save web-space, contact me for the pictures if needed-</span>
<br />I have one question - the rom of this cartridge is dumped, so would it be possible to reverse engineer the PAL's logic with the help of the rom and understanding of the mapper? The rom is mapper 225, PRG:1024k, CHR:512k, SRAM:8k (but it is possible that this cartridge is different, those numbers are only from the rom I've found on the web). I'm not telling I can do it, but maybe somebody can... 
<br />
<br />Thanks for all your answers, I really want to make this cartridge working again...
<br />
<br /><strong>EDIT:  sorry I have other things in mind -changed 74HC460 for 74HC670 in the first line...</strong>

<br />
<br />Yes with the known mapper logic (and PCB schematics) it's possible to reimplement the PAL but I think it's a lot more trouble than the cart is worth. I really doubt the components are broken, you probably just need to check all of the traces for shorts and do a continuity check on each connection. From the on-screen garbage in the pictures I'd guess there's a CHR address line short.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />So according to the garbage on the screen, you think it's only some short circuit or a bad trace? Because I have explicitly checked (visually) the PCB and didn't see anything wrong. Those 3 big chips are nearly identical, I must check the traces only to find out which one is the PRG or CHR or SRAM. Isn't it possible that the SRAM is responsible? And, if you check the pictures, the mirroring-hacked mario (Fancy mario) has garbage, but the original has not. Can't this mean something? ...just speculating.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />There is no SRAM, there are three 4M ROMs. The two on the left are PRG, the one on the right is CHR.
<br />
<br />I'm not sure if there's a short, but it appears there's a conflict on the PPU address lines which is messing up rendering intermittently. These games are NROM and CNROM which means they don't do bankswitching very often if at all, so since they display the correct tiles most of the time, I don't think it's the registers. The registers are decoded by the PAL, so I don't think it's the PAL. Do you know if this cart ever worked? Maybe it was sold with an uncorrected PCB mistake like the PAL driving PPU A10 as well as VRAM A10 or CHR address outputs tied to PPU address lines. Or maybe a component really has failed, however unlikely; if the PAL failed it could possibly be haphazardly clocking the bankswitch registers, or if the CHR ROM failed it could be shorting the address bus, maybe. That's pretty far fetched heh.

<br />
<br />The thought about the cart not working correctly from the beginning is not that crazy. The seller was kind of suspicious... 
<br />
<br />BUT I am thinking now about trying to run this cart on one of my many fami-clones, maybe this cartridge was built explicitly for some kind of famiclone and not for the original Famicom (that I'm using now). 
<br />[Why didn't I tried this before? <img src="./images/smilies/icon_mad.gif" alt=":x" title="Mad" /> I have many pirates exclusively working with only specific famiclones...]
<br />
<br />And if that won't work, I'll desolder the chips and try to dump them, just to see if it will work on an emulator. Maybe I'll discover the error in one of those ROMs (or underneath them).
