Sorry for taking so long to get back with this.<br /><br />I finally decided that there was no way to have the player's animation look good when attacking downward and still have the weapon spawned below the hitbox, so I decided to make the hitbox only 15x15 pixels when the player is in that respective state and direction. This does present the issue of the weapon being hard to see, since now there's sprite flicker. I guess I could tweak the engine slightly to draw object 1 (hard-coded to be the player's weapon) first, and then objects 0 and 2-15. Or, since I'm using CHR-RAM, I could dynamically load the sprite of the player's leg drawn around the weapon depending on the weapon being used. I'll see.<br /><br />I've done numerous small tweaks to the graphics and frames of animation. The frames for when he's standing are different, so that when he attacks it looks more like he's lunging. I'm still not fully satisfied when he's attacking up and down, as the legs still look kinda weird and ambiguous for what he's supposed to be doing. But here's how everything looks right now:<br />facings_updated.png<br />walkings_updated.gif<br />attackings_updated.gif<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">tokumaru wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"><br />I can think of very few cases where NES sprites turned out good when using black outlines and a single palette, and if you think about it, wasting 33% of the colors just on outlines doesn't sound very sensible.<br /><br />I personally don't like sprite outlines, but if you really must have them, maybe it would be better to use a dark shade of an actual color that you can reuse. You could easily use the same dark brown for outlines, pants and hair, freeing one slot for a more interesting color. You can highlight the brown areas using a light shade so that they don't look flat. Just an idea.<br /></div><br />Something like this, perhaps?<br />new_palette.png<br /><br />I more or less need to use an outline, since a fair part of what I plan to be the game will take place on an island with sand, which is the same color as the players skin, and they'll blend together and make it hard to tell what's going on.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=7124">Sogona</a> — Mon Jun 26, 2017 11:52 am</p><hr />

Color contrast is important when designing a character and the stages. Right now, your character is pale yellow and medium brown... Of the three colors shown in your backgrounds, which the player will constantly be in front of, one is primarily pale yellow. The other is primarily light brown. Ever wonder why &quot;soldiers&quot; dressed in bright blues and reds in overhead shooters like Ikari Warriors (instead of the greens and browns actual soldiers wear for camouflage)?<br /><br />As for the sprite: consistency between angles, consistency between frames, and appropriate, realistic movement for actions such as walking, attacking, etc. all need to be focused on.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=5942">M_Tee</a> — Fri Mar 24, 2017 7:04 am</p><hr />

If this wasn't mentioned already, one thing that bothered me much is the inconsistency on the size of his arms in the side views.<br />It's most noticeable in the walking animation, that his arm alters between really thick and really thin. Also, in the attack animation the arm changes from a muscular one to a thin one when it is stretched out.<br />I know it may be difficult to work with the low resolution, but it's just too noticeable to me, so I'd recommend some tweaking.<br /><br />Considering that pixels are a bit 'fat' when the Famicom screen is viewed on a authentic NTSC screen (pixel aspect ratio is 8:7, according to the <a href="http://wiki.nesdev.com/w/index.php/Overscan" class="postlink">wiki</a>), it could look even worse on a real 4:3 TV (and horrible if someone just stretched the display on a 16:9 wide screen monitor).<br /><br />Awwwwww!

Watch videos/animations of sword fights, or even try to do these movements yourself. When people make a stabbing movement, they usually put one foot forward, for balance. Your character is currently bending his knees or doing nothing with his legs (depending from where you're looking), so that's definitely something that can be improved.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=95">tokumaru</a> — Thu Mar 23, 2017 10:18 pm</p><hr />

Alrighty, then you might want to try making the clouds a bit taller, maybe like the ground where there's a top part, middle part, and bottom part. Also be aware that the top and bottom rows of tiles may be offscreen. For example, my television cuts almost two rows off the top and one row off the bottom. Other TVs may be better or may be worse.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=21">Drag</a> — Tue Mar 08, 2016 1:02 pm</p><hr />
