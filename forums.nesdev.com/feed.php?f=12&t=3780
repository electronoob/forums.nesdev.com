Oh, my Celius it's amazing how you're able to Nintendoize images ! I couldn't do it look that good. I've nintendoized some portrait as well, always ending with mediocre results. The best way I found is to do it in black and white, and do the colors by hand. Did you did this ?<br /><br />And yes, as for small enemies and so it's always beter to do them by hand. You'd want to draw them before to know what you're doing, but still draw the pixels by hand. I may be wrong tough.<br /><br />And why would a reset code return something ? Since nobody ever calls the rest code (aka main procedure). I trought a main procedure would always be void type and never have any argument, else it really make no sense.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=38">Bregalad</a> — Tue Dec 18, 2007 4:41 am</p><hr />

I'm sorry, the explanation of the "Int" leaves me still confused. What do you mean by "the calling subroutine"? I just don't see why "Int" needs to be there. That's short for integer, right?<br /><br />And about the picture. I could shrink it in photoshop, it's just that it would turn out distorted, and may not even look like what I drew in the first place. I think drawing it small to start out would be better. When I first shrunk my painting, I could barely tell what I was looking at. I of course had to trace over the whole thing again.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=138">Celius</a> — Mon Dec 17, 2007 9:20 pm</p><hr />

It's surprising to hear that you get decent using porting a SCANNED image to 2BP, but if you can, by all means use this !<br /><br />I couldn't agree more, the sound of FF5 advance is absolutely terrible. The sound of some other games ported from SNES to GBA sounds allright such as Breath of Fire or Donkey Kong Country but still, no GBA game's sound is even close to their SNES counterpart. (EDIT : And yes, I almost always use external speakers on the GBA so I can get decnet bass).<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=38">Bregalad</a> — Mon Dec 17, 2007 2:17 pm</p><hr />

I would consider doing GBADev, but I really like the SNES a lot more for some reason. I hate the sound quality of GBA. When I play SNES ports on the GBA, I just think the sound was so much better on the SNES. I own Final Fantasy V on GBA and on SFC. The SFC version's sound was a lot more clear, and I enjoyed playing it more on the console. I don't know, I just am attracted to the SNES for some reason. I really do like NESDev, because it's not nearly as complicated as SNESDev, and I don't feel like I need a team of 30 developers to do everything for me so I can get something done in under 3 years.<br /><br />Graphically speaking, the SNES is great compared to the NES. Making a game look good isn't that hard if you have your good old buddy the scanner. I even use it for some things in my NES games, such as the portrait for a character. I painted it, scanned it, and Nintendoized it. I don't think I would have had the patience to make that portrait in a graphics editor such as YY-CHR. So yeah, a scanner is the way to go for me.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=138">Celius</a> — Mon Dec 17, 2007 1:21 pm</p><hr />

Yes, you both are right. SNES dev is kind of dead, maybe not totally dead but sure not as alive as NESdev. On the other hand, it's sure much harder to get a SNES game looking good with title such as Chrono Trigger or Stat Ocean out as compared with the NES where the best titles are impressive, but not THAT much impressive anymore. I don't see the point in doing SNESdev if you make NES looking games on the SNES.<br />However, the GBAdev communauty is sure alive and the GBA has similar capabilities than those of the SNES.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=38">Bregalad</a> — Mon Dec 17, 2007 12:53 pm</p><hr />

Yeah, BGMapper would be really cool if it worked. Everytime I type in BGMapper (FileName), it says "Cannot load file". I tried typing in the whole directory, I tried changing the screen mode and it still didn't work. I just have a save state from ZSNES in the same folder as the editor, and I cannot get anything to happen. I just wish it would specify what it means by "Cannot Load File". I wish it would tell me if there is no such file, or if it can't recognize the filetype rather than the annoying "Cannot Load File". Is it not compatible with Save State files from different versions of ZSNES?<br /><br />EDIT: Nevermind. I was able to drag the save state onto the program icon to get it started.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=138">Celius</a> — Sun Dec 16, 2007 7:49 pm</p><hr />
