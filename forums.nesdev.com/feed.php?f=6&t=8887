Thanks for ripping this, guys! Though, I'm very curious as to why they changed the music for the PAL release... it sounds like they even went so far as to change the entire music engine. o_O (They might not have, but things do sound a bit different...)<br /><br />An interesting thing to note is that track 20 of the NSF went on to be the BGM for 1P mode on the SNES version. I booted up the rom for this game, and I couldn't find this song in any of the modes... but I didn't really play that far, so it might be accessible later on.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=21">Drag</a> — Thu May 17, 2012 7:44 pm</p><hr />

Just one more thing.<br /><br />At the beginning of the play routine is where you would find that address to switch the tune. A great deal of Nintendo drivers are similar to the same way. This game's audio driver is a little different than a lot of Nintendo drivers though. Some of the older games clear the tune index addresses at the very end of the play code. So, it's easier to find than debugging the code.<br /><br />00:8003:A5 F0     LDA $00F0 = #$00<br />00:8005:C9 FE     CMP #$FE<br />00:8007:F0 0D     BEQ $8016<br />00:8009:A2 FE     LDX #$FE<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=43">Gil-Galad</a> — Thu May 17, 2012 7:44 am</p><hr />

I don't use those automatic optimizers anymore. They can cause a lot of problems and eliminates code that could be necessary if used in a ROM. Anything that wasn't included in the rip index would be wiped out as well.<br /><br />The information was correct about ripping the game. I made some really simple code.

If you want to "optimize" an NSF file, there's a way.  FCEUX's code-data logger has a feature to create a "stripped" NES rom, removing any code or data that wasn't used when running the rom.  Fast forward to the max, let each song loop several times, and you have an "optimized" NSF.<br /><br />But FCEUX deliberately disables the code-data logger and stripped ROM creator if you loaded an NSF file.  They were concerned about needing to fix an NSF later, which becomes hard to do when the code and data for the rom block is gutted away.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=53">Dwedit</a> — Thu May 17, 2012 6:20 am</p><hr />

B00daW and I ended up ripping it:<br /><br /><a href="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/883356/Wario%27s%20Woods%20%28Europe%29.NSF" class="postlink">http://dl.dropbox.com/u/883356/Wario%27s%20Woods%20%28Europe%29.NSF</a><br /><br />What's the process for submitting new NSF rips? Is there an optimizer program they should be run through? (This is only 16k anyway...)<br /><br /><br />As for how we did this, B00daW found the music code/data block in the ROM (I don't know what his process was for this), then copied the INIT code from the NTSC rip. This by itself doesn't work yet, but it's a good starting point, after which the following was done:<br /><br />1. Discovered that the game triggers a new song by writing a song number to $F0 (it was $F3 in the NTSC version). I think B00daW did this by poking values in an emulator until he found the one that changes the song.<br /><br />2. Traced through the NMI code in the ROM to find where the PLAY routine should point, turned out to be at $8003. (It was $8000 in the NTSC version.)<br /><br />3. Still didn't work; eventually we discovered that the PAL version has an initialization subroutine at $8000 that sets up some necessary RAM variables. Called this from INIT, and we had a working NSF.<br /><br />4. Tested all 256 possible values for $F0 to find which ones actually made sound. 0-55 all worked. Most were silent above this range, but a few made some broken sounding noises; I didn't include these, I think they were just random data kind of stuff, except 110 (NSF track 57), which sounds similar to 6 (NSF track 7) but without the square channels active. (Feel free to remove it if this was inappropriate. Just edit byte 6 of the NSF from $39 to $38 to get rid of it.)<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=5165">rainwarrior</a> — Thu May 17, 2012 3:00 am</p><hr />
