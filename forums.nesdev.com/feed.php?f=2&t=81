I've always planned on doing some kind of IDE interface for the NES, though I'm far too busy with work and GTN to at the moment. One day...<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=42">Brian_Provinciano</a> — Tue Dec 07, 2004 11:16 pm</p><hr />

If you don't remember me, I'm the guy who wanted to try a DDR project, which unfortunately fell through.  I haven't been at the forums because I've been busy with college.<br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://devster.retrodev.com/">http://devster.retrodev.com/</a><!-- m --><br /><br />This site is mostly for Sega Genesis development, but it has some nice 8-bit tools, like...<br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://devster.retrodev.com/ee.html">http://devster.retrodev.com/ee.html</a><!-- m --><br /><br />This is a simple 8-bit IDE interface for various 8-bit processors, including 6502(^^), 808X, and the Z80.<br /><br />I can't make and test it, since I can imagine that it requires loading software to use.<br /><br />I'm sure you guys can do something with it.  I'm taking a QuickBasic programming class, so hopefully I won't sound like a COMPLETE idiot.<br /><br />I was thinking that it would need an OS in the hard drive(duh), preferably with some form of GUI, or maybe something taken from an existing emulator, which could select which ROM on the hard drive to load and if there were any Game Genie files or savestates that exist.  Basically, take an emulator's file system, GG and savestate, but let the NES handle the hardware.<br /><br />Also, a Hard Drive loading cartidge would likely be necessary.<br /><br />Maybe you could even use his to play FDS ROMs?   That may require emulation from the file to the output of the adapter of the FDS.<br /><br />You may be able to take the NES and network it somehow, but I'd be willing to connect the hard drive to a normal computer the old fashioned way and hook it up.<br /><br />Maybe even pack the Hard Drive with some development tools. ^^<br /><br />I do not take credit for making this.  I merely found someone else's work.<br /><br />What do you guys think?<br /><br />(P.S.  Check out their forums.  One guy took a Genesis and made a complete computer with a Hard Drive, ISA, etc.  You just have to see it to believe it...)<br /><br /><br /><br />Edit:<br /><br />Looking over everything, I realize that we can't have a single  button dedicated to save states, or any savestate icon in the game.  Maybe hitting Select, A, and B could save it.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=68">MM007</a> — Sun Dec 05, 2004 2:33 pm</p><hr />
