This chip would also substitute the SRAM power circuit usually involving two diodes and one resistor (which can be considering costing $0.30, for a total of $1.00, as opposed to the chip which costs $2.75).<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=38">Bregalad</a> — Tue May 10, 2011 9:51 am</p><hr />

Off topic, but the post about plugging in carts while a system was on...<br /><br />I once plugged in a cartridge into a Commodore 128 while it was on. After removing the cartridge and powering off and on typing on the keyboard would print out the incorrect characters that corresponded to the keys. (Eg, typing a "z" might print out a "@").<br />Even after powering on and powering off, it took pressing the key a number of times before it finally printed the correct character. To this day, I have no idea how or why it did that.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=45">drk421</a> — Mon May 09, 2011 1:54 pm</p><hr />

Then you could organize the save data as six save slots in three pairs: current and last known good.

On Final Fantasy 3, while I'm not sure but based on other FF games, it actually does maintain hidden save slots you cannot see. While there are 3 slots you can see it actually has others in memory which it falls back on if CRC checks fail. <br /><br />If your theory is correct about NES and accessing SRAM while powering off causes it, then in theory using SRAM only for game state backup and only accessing it at very minimal times should eliminate the problem. But I seem to recall Zelda executes alot of code from SRAM. So maybe it is more likely to effect games which actively write to SRAM. Zelda probably doesn't write to it during gameplay.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=1726">MottZilla</a> — Mon May 09, 2011 11:27 am</p><hr />

Yes I was talking about turning the system on/off wile the game is inserted (you are supposed to do that and only that). It happened me only one time for a SNES game and a couple of time for Gameboy and GBA games, but it happens all the time on the toploader NES (especially with old SNROM-03 boards).<br /><br />I think a big difference is that NES games are acessing SRAM basically all the time because the system RAM is so small, and games use SRAM for a lot of other things than saving. If you turn the system off while the CPU is attempting to write anything to SRAM (even if it's something unrelated to game saves) chances are that there will be problems affecting the actual saves, and corrupting them.<br />The circuit I mentioned would probably fix this.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=38">Bregalad</a> — Mon May 09, 2011 5:15 am</p><hr />
