<br />
<br />About 2273 CPU cycles.  Depending on your instruction mix that's either a chunk of code (1136 2-cycle opcodes) or a little bit of code (324 7-cycle opcodes).  So, I guess that isn't very helpful.  You'll be somewhere between 324 and 1136, roughly.

<br />1 scanline is the pre-vblank scanline and you can't use it unless you have IRQs or other timed code to know when that scanline is coming.
<br />1 scanline is the pre-render scanline, you can use it as extra vblank time if you turn off the screen, then do a complete set of scroll writes after turning the screen back on.
<br />
<br />If you just use the normal vblank lines, that's 21 scanlines at 341 PPU cycles (113.666 CPU cycles) each, for 2387 total CPU cycles.  Of course, there's also the NMI interrupt triggering, and all your other code to get ready to start spitting out graphics, so there's less time than that actually available for your graphics display loop.

<br />
<br />I'll put an alternative out there:
<br />
<br /><img src="http://img703.imageshack.us/img703/7448/exevis.png" alt="Image" />
<br />
<br />I set up the red execution marker in the nesyar source over its entire NMI routine, and the green marker over the jsr to the sound routine.  The Execution Visualizer shows me where each marked code region is executing in the PPU frame and how many CPU cycles it took last time it ran.  It's a bit hard to see in the image but the area to the right of the quotile shield is HBLANK (the red/green stretches into it.  The image is 341x262 (or 341x312) pixels big, so you can see it covers the entire PPU clock domain and shows where the CPU is doing whatever you marked to see.  I can add eight different marked regions and see where they are in relation to each other or how long they are taking.  Plan is to add min/max/avg also to cycle counts.  In the image, the top left (0,0) is the screen pixel (0,0), so VBLANK time is at the bottom (where it's all red).  Obviously nesyar eats into the screen time  a bit in NMI but only to do sound updates.

<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">nmi:<br />&nbsp; sta $4020 ; Start the timer.<br /><br />&nbsp; ; TODO: Do the vblank updates here.<br /><br />&nbsp; sta $4030 ; Stop the timer.<br /><br />&nbsp; rti<br /></div>
<br />Then you can see the number of cycles taken by the vblank updates in the debugging window. As long as the "max" value is less than ~2270, you're in the good.

<br />You can do that on the NES with the $2001 register.

<br />
<br />Funny you should mention that tepples!  I attended Edward Tufte's "Information Design" seminar last year.  As part of that I got signed copies of all four of his books and a poster.  I am a strong believer in techniques for visualization of information.  Sparklines are so obviously useful, concise, and unencumbered with need for prior knowledge of the visualization technique.
<br />
<br />I could probably whip up a sparkline control in Qt pretty quick...so now that you've planted the idea, expect to see it.   <img src="./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" />

<br />It just struck me that you might have been referring to the game visual, not the tool.  No, I did not write nesyar.  That was authored by clueless.  Haven't seen him around in a while though.
