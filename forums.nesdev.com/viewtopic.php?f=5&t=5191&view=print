During the day there are all sort of distractions: the phone ringing, noisy neighbors, family wanting attention, and so on. Late at night it's much more quiet. But I do need my sleep, so if I can't sleep until late the next day, I won't be able to stay up late again.

My favorite thing is when I have the house to myself and I have nothing else to do and I have some time to do what I want during the day. That's when I'm most constructive, but it's seldom that I have that little time.
<br />
<br />I do most of my work at night though. I usually am awake when everyone else is asleep. I usually get to bed after 4 AM, even if I have to get up at 6 AM I still stay up late. But if I'm really tired and/or distracted, I'm not getting much done. It also doesn't help that where my computer is there are people falling asleep to TV and I can't help but watch what's on while trying to do my work  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /> .

<br />
<br />I was liking that during college days (working at night, not being tired) and could program until 3am in the morning, waking up and going to school after but now if I do that for a few days.. Forget it, I feel sick.  That doesn't leave much time for hobbies which mean either during lunch time or late at night if you can still focus.

<br />
<br />I can function on less than 6 hours sleep, but I'm more cranky than usual, and I end up having stomach/digestive problems as a result from the increased stress.
<br />
<br />I happen to work nights (2300-0700 Pacific Time (UTC-0700 right now)), so sleep is incredibly important.  :-)
<br />
<br />I used to be able to get shit done on 4-6 hours sleep on a regular basis, but that was back when I was in my late teens/early 20s.  Such isn't the case any more -- body's falling apart...

<br />
<br />On the other side I like waking up early in the morning when I get a few vaction days (this hasn't happened since a VERY long while) to do programming, usually arround 7-8, but sometimes evern up to 5 am (rarely).
<br />
<br />When I'm sleeping, I just can't be awaken if I haven't got at least 7 hours of sleep even if something really noisy happens. And I've happened to sleep up to 14 hours I guess, but never 30 or something like that  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_eek.gif" alt=":shock:" title="Shocked" />

<br />
<br />Japan is a workaholic culture in general. This mean even thought the government set some rules about overtime and a normal work week is supposed to be 40h, company often expect you do to 2h of "compulsory" overtime (and they try to make sure the government doesn't know about it.  Then you have those people that arrive at 9h in the morning and leave at 23h at night.  Some people are forced to do so (my wife when working at the bank in the past was working 15h per day and sometime weekend too! that's slavery) or some people seems to see that at the norm or even enjoy it.  It's is common to hear about people dying out of overwork　（残業殺し zangyogorshi, which mean death by overwork if my memory is good). And overtime is in most of the time not paid at all or in my case "after you do more than 40h during the month" (...)
<br />
<br />As for myself, I decided not to enter in that crazy cycle and just do my normal hours.  I'm lucky that I can do that.  But still, it is common to have between an 1h or 2 of commute to go to work so it makes the day longer. Imagine the guy that worked already 15h and now have to 1h30 of train.. This mean 18h of his day was for work only.

<br />
<br />I suppose I'm more motivated when someone I admire/respect is involved, though that could be just a friend or family member. But I'm really not the romantic relationship-seeking type of person, so if a girl is involved, I'd only be motivated if she was someone I admired as a friend or family member.
