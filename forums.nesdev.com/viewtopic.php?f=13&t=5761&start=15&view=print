I didn't know much english and wanted one fast so I ended up with Darkness. That's was not very original but I stayed a few years with it on BBS (you know, the one with modems and 2400 baud things). I stopped using it after a while, maybe after college.
<br />
<br />When I decided to make an account on nesdev, I didn't know what to use. Since I knew english a lot more then when I was a kid, I knew that I shouldn't use my previous one since it was too generic. I wanted something different that nobody use.  So I took one Japanese word and checked about it. Nobody seems to use so this is how I ended up with mine.  The kanji for the word are 晩酌. For the ones that don't want to make the effort to check in the dictionary, the first kanji is for evening, the second one is the sound of pouring alcohol or pouring someone alcohol which mean "Evening drink" <img src="./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" />

<br />I was about as uncreative as it gets.  I was Gandalf all the way through the 300baud CompuServe days on C=64, and the 1200/2400 then blazing fast 14,400 C= Amiga days.
<br />
<br />Those were the days...I was obsessed with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psygnosis#Psygnosis" class="postlink">Psygnosis'</a> logo and made a perty darn cool Gandalf logo themed the same way.  I really should dig that back up...might make a cool avatar.
<br />
<br />I guess my uncreativity continues...my usual nicks are my name with _'s or...in this case...the name of my never-to-be-finished-but-forever-to-be-worked-on tool.

<br />You know tepples, its quite possible that this kid is not actually that much of a little gay wad in real life and he is just putting on an act. Perhaps queery little kid is just a role he plays.

<br />
<br />That said, I completed two of the phonotactic models in <a href="http://pics.pineight.com/charname.ss" class="postlink">this Scheme program</a>. They return a linked list of phonemes. (I now prefer Python.)

<br />What happened to him? Did he suddenly become asian? He's acting and talking completely different. The first few vlogs were pretty believable, but this sudden change makes me believe he got too carried away with the acting.

<br />
<br />If his mother trying to listen to NPR and accidentally turned on some Lady Gaga, wouldn't you expect her to just change the station rather than listening to the whole thing including the station call, artist and song title?  I would surmise that his mother would be especially protective and do her best to keep her son from being exposed to sexual lyrics such as those.
<br />
<br />Watching the first compared to more recent ones, he has certainly played up his vocalization and enunciation as time has gone on.  To me that shows knowledge that he is annoying/bothering other people and he wants to push it further.
<br />
<br />It does seem possible that he might be diagnosed with something like Aspergers, though.  I would agree with the theory that he has an older, meaner sibling who is forcing him to read these scripts.
