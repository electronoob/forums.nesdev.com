<br />I only have square with its ptimer, duty cycle and envelope generator emulated. 
<br />I hear the tones, but very bad.
<br />What could it be?

Here's a simple wave file writer: <a href="http://h1.ripway.com/blargg/temp/wave_writer.zip" class="postlink">wave_writer.zip</a>
<br />To use it, just call wave_open( sample_rate, "file.wav" ), then wave_write( buffer, number_of_samples ) (NOT number_of_bytes, mind you) one or more times with your samples (at the same place you play them with DSound), and wave_close() when you're done.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />yeah, it's a dsound problem. I used a library named "bass" and when i play the sample i get the same error that i get with disch interface. How could it be? If im going to use a lib wich lib do you recommend?
<br />Anyway I will have to take a the wav output.
<br />
<br />Thanks for the source file.

<br />
<br />But anyway.. my money is on the sound just dropping out.  From the looks of this code, you seem to be doing everything one instruction at a time which simply might be too slow for the audio to be generated and streamed in realtime.
<br />
<br />I like to make an analogy by comparing audio programming to an hourglass.  With an hourglass you pour sand in the top, and it slowly drains out the bottom at a fixed rate.  Audio programming is the same -- you put audio (sand) in the buffer (top) and it slowly plays back (drains out) at a fixed rate.  If you ever run out of audio, the playback stops -- just like an hourglass stops once it runs out of sand.  This stop causes breaks in the sound and makes it sound bad.  This is referred to as "buffer underrun".  To prevent this from happening, you always need to make sure you have enough audio in the buffer.
<br />
<br />What I suspect is happening is that the audio you put in the buffer is draining faster than you can refill it.  But that's just a guess -- without being able to compile or hear the broken audio, it's hard to tell.
<br />
<br />
<br />Also you have the right idea with the linear interpolation -- however you're doing it wrong.  The code you have there may be adding to the problem.  For now, stick with nearest neighbor (get rid of that block that averages them and just output GetEnvelope() &lt;&lt; 8 directly).  Worry about one thing at a time -- once you have audio working -- then go back and fix your linear interpolation.  Don't bite off too much at once -- makes problems much harder to diagnose and solve.

<br />
<br />The emulator code could be slow, but running on a 2.2 ghz processor?
<br />
<br />Anyway i made a test. I put your fillbuffer() func after the nes frame completes to fill a 1500 bytes (16 bits) separate buffer, then i lock and copy the buffer to the dsound one with the sine wave sample and the the tone isn't interrupted or messed up.
<br />
<br />This thing is getting me crazy.

<br />
<br />Good!  This tells me that the DSound is working.  The problem must then be in your emu core.  Either that or you're copying to the dsound buffer incorrectly (but I find that much less likely).
<br />
<br />Keep in mind -- I haven't seen any of your APU code or even heard the broken sound you're describing, so I'm driving blind here.  Unless you give me more info (like the full source so I can try it out myself) it's impossible to diagnose your problem.  All I can do is make guesses.
