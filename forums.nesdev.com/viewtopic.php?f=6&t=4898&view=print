<br />
<br />in the top left corner is a hex pair that is incremented with Left and Right (rapid increment with B button)
<br />
<br />on the right are the four registers of the NES' first sound channel, the rectangular wave
<br />when you press the A button, the hex pair is stored in the register to which the arrow (&gt;)is pointing. this arrow's position can be changed with the Up/Down buttons. when the Start button is pressed, all the bytes displayed are written to their respective addresses. select writes $00 or $FF to the $4015 register.
<br />
<br />i still have to confirm what i have just written...

Your thread is even likely to attract no attention at all, unless most people are curious like me...! Anyway, I haven't checked the program yet, but I will (as soon as I can make noise in the room).

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Reminds me of Snowbro's test ROM from long ago! However, I'm glad to see that you have arrows in yours! But, I think his source is included, which may help you expand your ROM.
<br />
<br />My only comment would be to use a better font / palette. I can imagine it being close to unreadable on my old NTSC CRT television.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />test roms! that's what you call them!
<br />ya, i think i engineered the font for originality and funkiness, and specifically not legibility. i guess the graffiti aesthetics are better left on the streets. with a better color scheme it could be improved a little though.
<br />
<br />i would have included the source, simply because i had no web hosting space and i was gonna tell people to go assemble it themselves. but my code is highly embarrassing, bloated and peppered with obscure comments and frankly, i was kinda shy to expose my n00bery and hereditary disorganised-ness to the world and that wouldn't be very courteous of me or convenient to anyone else. so i decided to omit it for now.
