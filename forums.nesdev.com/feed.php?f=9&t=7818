its just easier to find say, on ebay, some fds disks rather than quickdisks (I actually have about 20 of those) and rewrite them yourselves. Now as far as rewriting fds disks, it is best to just use an old school PC that's from the early to mid 90's or so. I got a cheap pentium laptop specifically for this purpose, and it was only 40 bucks. Luckily for me, I have a custom made fdsloadr cable that connects the fds drive to my parallel port that writes. fds images to disk.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3485">RGB_Gamer</a> — Sun Oct 09, 2011 11:52 am</p><hr />

Cool I wonder how complicated it is to dump or rewrite discs with those...<br />You know the disc might be the same mechanically but be formated in another way.<br /><br />Yet I'm pretty sure this should be the easiest way, at worse you can modify the drivers in assembly to match FDS formatting, which is probably easier than highacking the real FDS drive communication with Linux, which sounds complicated, especially considering there is more security inside the FDS drive itself.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=38">Bregalad</a> — Mon Sep 26, 2011 11:58 am</p><hr />

Some Amstrad computers and some other European computers used QDs, usually as an add-on.  The Sharp MX 700, iirc, used one as an add-on, and the Mz-1500 had it built in.  People have been known to dump FDS disks with the MZ-1500, but I've never figured out exactly how...possibly just the copying disk that is included with the MZ, but I dunno.  I believe people jacked their FDS drive into the drive input on the MZ.  I wish I knew.<br /><br />The MSX also had an add-on QD drive.  I've got one of them.<br /><br />-Rob<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=200">rbudrick</a> — Fri Sep 23, 2011 3:49 pm</p><hr />

@ Bregalad: For C54 disks, try a Catweasel PCI. It may even be possible to adapt it to the Mitsumi disk format and use FDS or QD mechs on it, but I've never given it any thought until now. <br /><br />For information on backup and writing of FDS disks, check out Eric's [url]FamicomDiskSystem.com[/url].<br /><br /><br />Sorry I haven.t popped in for a while... Busy times and the like, mostly spent writing and HW design. Nothing amazing or brilliant yet: My creative abilities are stumbling around to match my state of depression. I'll read-over this thread and modify my post with any annotations that I feel are applicable.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=4070">Xious</a> — Fri Jul 08, 2011 10:16 am</p><hr />

While the sound cards do 192KHz, the filters on the card kill off anything above 16...20KHz... Removal of filters will help with that, and if not you got a crappy card where the driver makes you think the card is good while in reality it is not :/<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3483">TmEE</a> — Thu Jun 09, 2011 8:25 am</p><hr />

Also the goal of the project is to archive unadulterated disks. Writing them can be done through software.<br /><br />I don't think Linux has the necessary low-latency for another FDS Loader.<br /><br />Abusing a soundcard for FDS purposes is an interesting idea. It might be a possibility at 192 kHz. An obstacle might be that DAC/ADC are delta sigma now and could be too noisy even after passive filtering, particularly when capturing.<br /><br />The bit rate according to Brad Taylor is 96.4 kHz. I haven't measured it exactly yet (I detect bits with a counter/threshold scheme) but I suspect it's an integer division from 21.477272 MHz.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=20">kyuusaku</a> — Sun Jun 05, 2011 5:53 pm</p><hr />

Read-Only maybe because he doesn't want to support people trying to sell bootleg disks? Just a guess.<br /><br />Quick Disks were using in MIDI Keyboards I think, as well as word processors.
