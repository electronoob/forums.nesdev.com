Do you mean DIP switches, or do you mean multiplexer chips?<br /><br />On HiROM, A15 from the edge connector goes to A15 of the rom chip, A16 goes to A16, A17.... and on and on. So you're involving everything from A15 to A22, and more conventionally using the uppermost address lines as chip select.<br /><br />You still ignore A23<br />the memory maps into the 64KB pages of banks $40-$7D and $C0-$FF.<br />the /ROMSEL (/CART) signal is still important to consider, so you don't conflict in bank $7F with Work RAM.<br /><br />To be in that bank range, A22 is always 1. This is a problem for the reset vector, and interrupt vectors in general, upon powerup, which is at bank $00, of which A22 is obviously 0. So you can't care about A22 being low or high.<br /><br />So this leaves you with A21...A20... etc.<br /><br />The $FF:FFFF - $C0:0000 spans 0-$3FFFF, so 4 Megabytes (or 32 megabits might be more familiar).<br />If you had a quantity of 4 of 1 Megabyte chips, how would you wire up the 74139 decoder?<br /><br />If you had only 2 of 1 Megabyte chips, how then would you wire it up, to be sure that the CPU still sees the reset vector at $00FFFCâ€“$00FFFD from at one of the ROM chips?<br /><br /><br />(I'll stop here as I'll admit I don't know how to map the Save RAM into HiROM at this exact moment.)</div><br /><br /><br />I am using some multiplexers..... To essentially shift the rom addresses to the hi or lo positions A15-A22.   <br /><br />I think I have a good circuit (need to test) for the hi rom board using a 139.<br /><br />Using 29F032 flash roms 1, maybe 2..... Not sure yet how many roms, maybe as much as 3 so star ocean can be run on it.  <br /><br /><br />I'm away on vacation so I'm not able to test anything for a short while.<br />Got to unplug every now and then<br /><br />Mark
