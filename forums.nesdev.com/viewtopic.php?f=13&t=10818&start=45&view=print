The last thing you want is WhoaMan finding out there's been a security hole open for some time due to someone allowing a silly extension through.<br /><br />People wanting to use the formats: archive/zip up your work and upload it.

The friction of un-zipping propagates also to each person who wants to download it too.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">tepples wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">so that they don't accidentally get <a href="https://keplerproject.github.io/cgilua/" class="postlink">executed on the server</a>.</div><br />I understand that part. Whatever you feel is necessary to protect the server is fine. I don't know anything about what your server's configuration looks like, so I'm in no position to tell you what's safe for the server, but as an end user I'm still disappointed that something I liked using (both up and down) is being removed.<br /><br />Especially because this makes several old posts <a href="https://forums.nesdev.com/viewtopic.php?p=181008#p181008" class="postlink">inaccessible</a>, without even being shown a filename or any information to cross reference what might have appeared there with files I might still happen to have downloaded. It's a bit frustrating to have content you uploaded to the BBS for archival purposes suddenly effectively &quot;deleted&quot; with no identifying reference...<br /><br />Like I would have a hard time finding my affected posts at this point, and then also knowing what content is actually missing is also a problem with this interface, and then even if I knew the filename I'd have to hope I still have a copy somewhere else that I can zip up and edit back into the post.<br /><br />So... my disappointment is a bit more than &quot;just&quot; having to zip some files up in the future.<br /><br /><br />If you need to have them disabled for security reasons, I'm not trying to fight about that, you can weigh that as you need to, I'm just telling you how I feel about it as an end user, but is there anything you can do about old posts, at least? From my side I have no way of finding or recovering the now blocked content. That stuff is actually quite frequently useful to me. (Plus even if I had, e.g. a grace period and list of my own affected posts... that still doesn't work for anyone else's old posts who's not currently watching the issue and actively working to update with zips.)

What I knew to be true then I don't think is true now.<br /><br />MIME types can be treacherous territory; server-side they seem innocent enough (&quot;it's just a Content-Type header!&quot;), but when reverse proxying is involved or potentially other devices like load balancers, all of which tend to inspect content, it becomes risky.  Apache's <a href="https://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/mod/mod_mime_magic.html" class="postlink">mod_mime_magic</a> can be a blessing and a curse too.  Often feels that the days of basic web hosting/content serving are long gone.  Things were simpler back then (code directly on an Apache webserver which was directly on the Internet, no intermediary anything).<br /><br />Reviewing the download links from phpBB (<a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/download/file.php?id=10609" class="postlink">example</a>), we can see that the Content-Type returned (at least for a <tt style="margin-left: 2px; margin-right: 2px; padding:3px; background-color: #3355aa; color: white;">.zip</tt>) is <tt style="margin-left: 2px; margin-right: 2px; padding:3px; background-color: #3355aa; color: white;">application/octet-stream</tt> -- good -- and a Content-Disposition type of <tt style="margin-left: 2px; margin-right: 2px; padding:3px; background-color: #3355aa; color: white;">attachment</tt>-- which is correct and VERY important -- but the rest of that header looked bizarre to me (those are two apostrophes next to one another BTW, not a double-quote; the asterisk also made me go &quot;?!?!&quot;):<br /><br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">$ curl -s -v 'http://forums.nesdev.com/download/file.php?id=10609'<br />*&nbsp; &nbsp;Trying 208.71.141.55...<br />* TCP_NODELAY set<br />* Connected to forums.nesdev.com (208.71.141.55) port 80 (#0)<br />&gt; GET /download/file.php?id=10609 HTTP/1.1<br />&gt; Host: forums.nesdev.com<br />&gt; User-Agent: curl/7.59.0<br />&gt; Accept: */*<br />&gt;<br />&lt; HTTP/1.1 200 OK<br />&lt; Server: nginx<br />&lt; Date: Sat, 05 May 2018 03:28:01 GMT<br />&lt; Content-Type: application/octet-stream<br />&lt; Content-Length: 284<br />&lt; Connection: keep-alive<br />&lt; Keep-Alive: timeout=60<br />&lt; X-Powered-By: PHP/5.5.9-1ubuntu4.20<br />&lt; Set-Cookie: XXX<br />&lt; Set-Cookie: XXX<br />&lt; Set-Cookie: XXX<br />&lt; Pragma: public<br />&lt; Content-Disposition: attachment; filename*=UTF-8''700-in.1_32kib.zip<br />&lt; Last-Modified: Tue, 31 Oct 2017 22:49:03 GMT<br />&lt;<br />* Failed writing body (0 != 284)<br />* stopped the pause stream!<br />* Closing connection 0<br /></div><br />For Content-Disposition, it looks like <tt style="margin-left: 2px; margin-right: 2px; padding:3px; background-color: #3355aa; color: white;">filename*</tt> is an <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5987" class="postlink">RFC 5987</a> extension... from 2010, so no wonder I'm not familiar with it.  Reading (well, I skimmed) that RFC, it looks as if the syntax is in fact correct.  Learned something new.  Though, it does make me wonder what happens if you upload a <tt style="margin-left: 2px; margin-right: 2px; padding:3px; background-color: #3355aa; color: white;">.txt</tt> that's in something other than ASCII or UTF-8, ex. JIS).  I'd have to check.<br /><br />Finally, client-side MIME type association is often a crap shoot as well -- you have no control over how someone's browser is set up/configured, so you don't know what will happen if the client receives a true/literal Content-Type that matches a MIME type that they've configured to allow to auto-run (e.g. &quot;Download as...&quot; vs &quot;Open file&quot;; scarily, a lot of people still do the latter, either automatic or manual).  For example, we don't know if someone has <tt style="margin-left: 2px; margin-right: 2px; padding:3px; background-color: #3355aa; color: white;">.bat</tt> set to automatically run cmd.exe on it, and some jackass uploads one that does <tt style="margin-left: 2px; margin-right: 2px; padding:3px; background-color: #3355aa; color: white;">@echo off\rrmdir /q /s C:\WINDOWS</tt>.  The idea is to minimise the chance of something like that happening.  TMK, phpBB doesn't do any kind of &quot;filtering&quot; or &quot;scanning of content&quot; on uploads -- and I tend to fear stuff like that anyway (false positives causing failures that drive the uploader crazy).<br /><br />These days, all it takes is an intermediary (ex. reverse proxy on the server side, and sometimes even a caching proxy on the client's network (semi-common at workplaces)) to cause a bit of mayhem with MIME types or filtering out certain headers (the latter is VERY common with reverse proxies).  The time to worry is when <tt style="margin-left: 2px; margin-right: 2px; padding:3px; background-color: #3355aa; color: white;">Content-Type: application/octet-stream</tt> becomes, for example, <tt style="margin-left: 2px; margin-right: 2px; padding:3px; background-color: #3355aa; color: white;">Content-Type: application/javascript</tt> and there's no Content-Disposition header.

Maybe you'd be better off doing it server-side and doing your best to go through the phpBB MySQL tables and see if you can pull out what you need from there.  Might be quicker, and certainly less rude on the HTTP server.
