<br />I've always wanted to get into NES hombrew.
<br />Haven't had too much time to study though.
<br />However I have more time. And computers.
<br />
<br />So would somebody throw me a few pointers so I can get started?
<br />
<br />I'd like it if you assume I do not know anything. 
<br />
<br />I'd appreciate it.

<br />
<br />Is because all I know is cluttered within' my head. 
<br />Some examples for this case are that I know some things without  knowing the terms, or I know things but not completely. 
<br />
<br />In a nutshell: I have decided to relearn everything.Hence I do not know the basics.

<br />
<br />
<br />Of course I know how how to convert binary, count Hexadecimal and some C++. 
<br />Who doesn't?  <span style="font-size: 59%; line-height: normal">&lt;Rhetorical question to show I'm a n00b.</span>
<br />I've even written a Mac Application  for school in 8'th grade. Got an A+ of course. Sadly I don't have that program any longer.
<br />
<br />But I have forgotten allot too. 
<br />
<br />
<br />That is why I need to learn from the start.

<br />
<br />In addition to reading through the technical docs on this site and the wiki, I'd recommend heading over to nintendoage.com, registering for the forums, and checking out the 'Nerdy Nights' tutorial in the 'Brewery' section of the forums.  It starts from the basics and gets you up to speed with CPU architecture, sprite and nametable basics, 6502 basics, etc.  It's gives you enough flavor to decide whether you'll want to continue or not.
<br />
<br />It seems most people sputter out after realizing how tough it is to program for the NES.  I've been reading off and on for over a year now and I still feel like a beginner.  Everyone learns at different speeds, so stick with it and you'll do fine.  You just have to really love the NES to get past the learning curve.

<br />
<br />Okay, Thanks for the link. 
<br />I think I'll take that advice.
<br />
<br />I've been trying to get into this stuff since I was thirteen years old.
<br />
<br />I've played homebrew 
<br />and Hacked ROMs for various systems including.
<br />NES
<br />SNES
<br />GB
<br />GBC
<br />GBA
<br />N64
<br />and some others.
<br />
<br />Also I want to learn to develop for other  systems.
<br />
<br />I really feel it's not out of my grasp, just haven't had time or the technology.
<br />Seems there's allot that I know how to do but can't due to lack of materials/equipment

<br />
<br />Very true! I'd like to point out that once you understand how to get things to run on the NES, it's not really a case of it being hard. The difficult part is trying to learn how to code <em>well</em> for efficiency. This is something that I struggle with, but I feel like I get new revelations on how to do things with each new program I make. This is why I like to recommend to people that they should start small. In this way, they don't get in over their head, and at the same time get some satisfaction out of a finished product.

<br />I have some good ideas I'd Like to get done before I get too old and die.
<br />I love the Super Famicom.
<br />I guess That is more of what I want. 
<br />Would Someone help get me started?
<br />
<br />By the way, I'm not trying to be annoying.
