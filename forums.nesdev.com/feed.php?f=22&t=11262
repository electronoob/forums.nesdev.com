I did really want to include Mighty Putty but I wasn't sure how it would fit in as a gameplay element, except maybe using it in the boss. Because this is going on the multicart and that will involve profit I'll probably have to tone down the obviousness of the references, or at least avoid trademark issues.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3838">NovaSquirrel</a> — Wed Jun 18, 2014 12:09 pm</p><hr />

I have about 6 levels now, out of a planned 10 so there's more to try out in this build. In addition to that, I finally transcribed the music I composed into the format Tepples' music engine takes, so there's music that's actually different from DABG's now. I think it might be too difficult currently but I'm not sure.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3838">NovaSquirrel</a> — Tue Jun 17, 2014 1:38 am</p><hr />

If the &quot;Big City Sliding Blaster&quot; sounding similar to Big City Slider Station, a possibly poorly made 16x16 sprite of Mays in the CHR ROM next to the player sprite and having two poor attempts at the background music from the Oxiclean detergent ball commercials as FTMs weren't a big enough indicator, yes the plan this entire time was to involve Billy Mays. Product names can be replaced with more generic ones if trademarks are an issue.<br /><br />I'm adding more polish, like right now dialog before the level for story reasons or to explain gameplay elements before they're introduced:<br /><img src="http://i.imgur.com/RL21YtI.png" alt="Image" /><br />The text here is stored in CHR ROM and I will probably end up using some sort of 5-bit scheme. It helps that someone who always shouts can just have all uppercase which would be easier to compress like that.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3838">NovaSquirrel</a> — Thu May 29, 2014 2:00 pm</p><hr />

Actually, Sliding Blaster will definitely fit as NROM-128. Now that I look at it, I've got most of the code in already and polish won't take more than what I have left. After all, the original version of DABG managed to fit as NROM-128. So the issue now is fitting it into the same bank as another NROM-128 game:<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">tepples wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"><br />How much RAM at $0000-$07FF is free?<br /></div><br />In Sliding Blaster, only 204 bytes of zeropage and 405 bytes of BSS (starting at $0300) are used. $5xx is used as a buffer when copying nametable data from CHR ROM to decompress afterward, but I can easily move it into $6xx (3 different arrays having to do with levels, 96 bytes available at the start of it) or $7xx (level buffer). Along with $01xx being used exclusively for stack purposes, there should be no problem finding some space it and another NROM-128 game both have free and placing an NMI vector somewhere.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3838">NovaSquirrel</a> — Sun May 25, 2014 10:27 am</p><hr />

That's enough for about three games' compressed CHR ROM, and I noticed a lot of games submitted to this compo use CHR RAM.

There's very little space in DABG that's both in large quantities and isn't either code or needs to be read at random (mostly levels maps and the title screen), so it's probably not feasible to shrink it any, but there's about 5kb free and I know at least most of it will stay free even when I'm done with the last thing I'm adding.<br />I'm not sure if I will run out of space depending on how big the scope of the project goes (I'll try not to and probably won't run out), but if I do I'll use the last few kilobytes free in DABG's bank and either trampoline into it via RAM or possibly just keep one of DABG's 16kb halves always loaded for routines in Sliding Blaster that aren't needed as often such as ones for the level editor.<br />The small CHR ROM in Sliding Blaster means it would be even easier to stuff into unused space.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3838">NovaSquirrel</a> — Sat May 24, 2014 10:02 pm</p><hr />

Preliminary test: This control scheme feels much better. I'll need to sit down with it to master it.<br /><br />As for extension to NROM-256 vs. remaining in the NROM-128 sweet spot: A &quot;submulti&quot; is my term for combining two arbitrary games into one 32K bank. But a submulti needs some way to tell which game's NMI handler to run. I handle this one of three ways:<br /><ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha"><li>Both games use the same NMI handler. That's how I combined Lawn Mower with Thwaite in volume 1. I debugged into Lawn Mower and saw that its NMI handler was functionally the same as that of Thwaite, namely a <a href="http://wiki.nesdev.com/w/index.php/NMI#Race_condition" class="postlink">3-byte &quot;simplest thing that could possibly work&quot; ISR</a>. </li><li>An area of RAM that neither game uses is reserved for deciding which NMI handler to run. This is how the rest of the volume 1 submultis were done. </li><li>Use 16K bank switching, so that the lower game's NMI vector is duplicated from $BFFA to $FFFA while it is running. I'm starting to use that with new ROM-building tools developed with mapper 28 in mind. This relies on each game's PRG ROM being no bigger than 16K. </li></ol><br />I've noticed plenty of empty CHR ROM in Sliding Blaster. If you can keep Sliding Blaster and DABG each under 16384 bytes of PRG ROM, possibly by stashing data in CHR ROM, they'll fit through method C. I don't know how similar the two games' NMI handlers are, but if you can share library routines between Sliding Blaster and DABG, they'll fit through method A or B. I noticed you can share at least the music engine and music sequence data.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=9">tepples</a> — Sat May 24, 2014 8:22 pm</p><hr />

I now have the control scheme for standard controllers default to interpreting a direction held with the D-Pad as a target direction and turning clockwise or counter clockwise (whichever is faster) to point there. I slowed it down a little (rotating only every other frame) but I'm not sure if it's still too fast, but it feels okay to me (I included a build so other people can comment on it).<br /><br />I only have ~4500 bytes left for NROM-128 and I feel like I might push into needing NROM-256, so I'd like to reserve a 32kb bank in the cart if I can, of which I'll only use up to 24kb and the rest can be used for graphics or an 8kb program. Sliding Blaster's graphics can probably fit in some of DABG's unused space when DABG is complete too since I don't have all that much to add to it.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3838">NovaSquirrel</a> — Sat May 24, 2014 3:36 pm</p><hr />

There are like 12 or so map layouts in the source and I was going to cycle through them all once, changing the enemy types or other things along the way. The original game it's based off of had a single unique map per level that enemies were placed on and you had to kill everything to proceed but I wanted to go for more of an arcade game. Right now level progression is based off how many enemies are killed, currently changing every 20 or so. Making levels more clear is also something I want to work on before the cart.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3838">NovaSquirrel</a> — Thu May 22, 2014 1:07 pm</p><hr />
