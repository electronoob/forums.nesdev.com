It's all a quesion of point of view. For me, vieo games are a form of art.

(well maybe not the music)<br /><br />Of course hacks are going to have original content -- but the game itself is not written from scratch.

This is the case with 100% of ROM hacks.<br /><br />Above two quotes pretty much support my point that DXOII is a ROM hack and not a homebrew.<br /><br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"><br />The limitations aren't useless, acually you're forced to deal with them if you want to ever run on a NES.<br /></div><br /><br />You totally missed the point of my analogy.<br /><br />You're basically saying:  "What's the point of doing a ROM hack when you can just homebrew"<br /><br />To put that in perspective, I'm saying:  "What's the point of making an NES homebrew when you can make a PC homebrew?"<br /><br />Now --- I'm not saying it's useless to make an NES homebrew.  I see the appeal.  However, I'm just trying to put this in perspective.<br /><br />I'm certain almost every reason you can come up with for choosing to make a NES homebrew over a PC homebrew can apply equally to a ROM hacker choosing to hack a game rather than write one from scratch.<br /><br />Example:<br /><br />- ROM hackers have more limitations than NES homebrewers.<br />- NES homebrewers have more limitations than PC homebrewers<br /><br />Come up with a few of your own reasons why someone might want to make an NES game instead of a PC game... then look at how that same reason applies to why someone might want to make a ROM hack instead of an NES homebrew.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"><br />And I don't think making a modern PC game is better than doing a NES game - just different.<br /></div><br /><br />EXACTLY<br /><br />I agree 100%<br /><br />So why do you think NES homebrews are better than ROM hacks?  They're not -- they're just different.<br /><br />I think the reason you think homebrews are better is because you're treating them like they're the same thing.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"><br />Now, making your own game engine is better than haking an existing one, regardless if it is PC, NES or anything.<br /></div><br /><br />As has already been brought up -- game companies recycle old code (and even sell their code to other companies) all the time.

Hahaha! You guys are giving Bregalad such a hard time! I think I understand what he means though, and for most part I agree with him.<br /><br />I agree that extensive hacks are so much trouble that it'd be better to just start a game from scratch. That's a programmer's perspective though, and many hackers wouldn't have the knowledge or the will to do it all.<br /><br />I, personally, am not a big fan of ROM hacking. I respect their work and am constantly amazed by the ammount of work they put into understanding exactly how a game works in order to be able to modify it so extensively. I'd never put myself through this though, and would rather put all my efforts into making something 100% mine.<br /><br />I also have a very tough policy on reuse of things I didn't make. I don't use anything unless I completely understand it, and, most of the time, I'd rather make my own version of things than spend a whole lot of time figuring out why someone did something the way they did.<br /><br />The bottomline is Bregalad has a valid point: as far as he is concerned, ROM hacking is not the most rewarding experience. I agree with him. What's not right is criticizing people who do find ROM hacking entertaining and rewarding (I don't know if he did, I didn't read the whole thread).<br /><br />In the end, it's all a matter of personal choice. If you want to code a whole game, and have the knowledge to do so, go for it. If instead you feel like modifying an existent game, and have the patience to do so, that's fine too (unless you are concerned about legal matters, of course). The important thing is that we respect each other's choices.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=95">tokumaru</a> — Wed Nov 01, 2006 1:51 pm</p><hr />

You're making no sense.<br /><br />The battle backdrops in FF never animated, neither did any of the enemies, yet you don't seem to have any problem with them.  Why is it that the hero of all things is the only thing that you have a beef with?<br /><br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"><br />Well, considering the work from the authors to have re-created a totally new world and sory that have absolutely nothing to do with the original Final Fantas game, the whole concept of the thing is just like homebrew, exept that they used the Final Fantasy ROM as a base, wich isn't a good idea in my opinion.<br /></div><br /><br />You basically summerized the <em>definition</em> of "ROM hack" and then said it isn't a good idea.  Just because DXOII took it a bit further than most...  it's like you're making accomplishment out to be a flaw.<br /><br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"><br />Definitely the work of authors was actually homebewing, as they recreated many thing, and not rom hacking,<br /></div><br /><br />The thing here is... they stuck with the <em>one thing</em> that makes it a ROM hack:  modifying an existing ROM.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"><br />wich inolve doing a single or several modification to an existing game, either to improve it, to translate it or to make fun with it changing graphics and/or music.<br /></div><br /><br />Translations and Facelifts are only two types of hacks.  There are hundreds and hundreds of ROM hacks which do more than simple 'improvements' and graphics changes.  Many change maps, abilities, plotlines, etc.  Those type of hacks all morph the original game into a new kind of game.  DXOII is the same thing -- it just does a little more than most.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"><br />As you stated homebrew and romhacking are two separate things, but Dragon X Omega is definitely much closer to a homebrew thing<br /></div><br /><br />I guess I just don't see how you can say that.  Either you don't have a lot of experience with ROM hacks that aren't more than graphics hacks, or you simply just have a beef with them on principle.<br /><br />99% of people that turn to ROM hacking do so with aspirations of making a "new game using XXXX's engine".  I can't tell you how many times I've heard that before.  To call them homebrewers would leave the ROM hacking world awfully small and empty.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"><br />And if you said yourself you make a game, then you call yourself a homebrewer and not just a rom hacker.<br /></div><br /><br />Creating a game from scratch = homebrew<br />Creating a game from an existing game = game modification = ROM hacking<br /><br />Nobody would call DXOII a homebrew.  At least, no one who knew what they were talking about.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"><br />I just say you were very limited in your design because of the limits of what romhacking can do, wich basically doesn't goal create game but modify existing ones.<br /></div><br /><br />Perfect example.  You're describing the ROM hacking process to a T here, but then...<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"><br />So DXO2 has been designed like a homebrew game<br /></div><br /><br />... turning around and calling it 'like a homebrew'.<br /><br />DXOII, believe it or not, was designed to be a <em>ROM hack</em>.  From day 1.  It was not designed to be a homebrew -- I don't know where you're getting that from, but it's clouding your judgement in a big way.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"><br />and realised as a romhacking ending up something weirdly out of standards.<br /></div><br /><br />I wouldn't say it's weird -- it certianly is <em>above</em> most ROM hacking standards.  But that's not all that weird.  There are some other very good, very thorough hacks out there... such as Super Metroid Redesign, Super Demo World, Rockman 2 Exile, Mario Adventure, and I'm sure countless others.<br /><br />Remember, ROM hacking isn't just facelifting and translations.  It's about game modification.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"><br />FF1's code is supposed to run FF1, and DW's code is supposed to run DW. And so on. If you're making your game, you're then supposed to make a code that runs what you want, regardless if it is more or less inspired by existing game engines, you'd still want to have your own technical customizations regardless of the game you're doing.<br /></div><br /><br />Such 'technical customizations' you're referring to are often called 'asm hacks' in the ROM hacking world, and DXOII has several.<br /><br /><br />Could DXOII be better if it was written from scratch (homebrew) instead of being a hack of FF1?   Absolutely.  I don't think even Sliv or Thadd will disagree with you here.<br /><br />But <em>was</em> DXOII written from scratch?  Is it a homebrew?  <em><strong>Absolutely not</strong></em> -- stop comparing it to one, stop looking at what it could be if it was one, and look at it for what it is:  a very advanced, unique, and thorough <em>ROM hack</em>.<br /><br />Does that mean that homebrews are better than ROM hacks?  Apparently you seem to think so, however many (including myself) would argue.  They're both different art forms, and they both produce different kinds of products.<br /><br />You don't seem to have a problem with someone making a NES homebrew.  Though if your logic were consistent you would.  You claim giving yourself unneccesary limitations makes for a worse game -- yet making a game for an NES forces all sorts of unnecessary limitations when compared to something like PC game dev.<br /><br /><br />Would you really tell a nesdev'er his game is no good because it could be much better if it was made for PC?  Of course not.... so why are you telling these ROM hackers that their game is no good because it could be much better if it was a homebrew?<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=33">Disch</a> — Wed Nov 01, 2006 11:42 am</p><hr />

<em>Well, you said yourself for example that it was a pain to work with FF's sound engine. By doing your own, the only limitations would be NES hardware, and no longer the software inside the Final Fantasy cartridge. </em><br /><br />Again, I worked with the limitations, and I had a lot of fun doing it. Simply because my original music didn't translate so well on the NES was to be expected. Also, there are damn few ROM hacks that exist that even attempt to create new, coherent music (I was actually one of the first people to hack a soundtrack in the first DXO, back when most said it was "impossible"), so that in itself is somewhat unique.<br /><br /><em>For example if you wish to have one dialog box show right after another to have a longer text, you cannot, just because FF engine don't handle that, and because Square's programmers didn't need that feature when first developping FF and because that was easier for them to not handle that feature.<br />Now, if you wish to have a longer text, you'll be forced to cut it in a shorter one, or to try to trick something in the ROM to bypass this, wich is obviously very hard, as opposed as making your own game engine, that is, once you master the NES and coding techniques for it, not so hard. </em><br /><br />Again, I worked with it. And according to the 80+ emails I've recieved regarding the game, the story turned out pretty well, so I overcame my limitations. :p<br /><br /><em>I would understand you use an existing engine beacuse you love the original game or something, but the fact to be limited to what the engine limited the original game ruin the whole thing. And if you said yourself you make a game, then you call yourself a homebrewer and not just a rom hacker. </em><br /><br />Oh, I love Final Fantasy, but our intent from the beginning was to make it as unlike Final Fantasy as possible (It emulated Dragon Quest/Warrior in a lot of ways). And I think this is your primary problem with our hack, is that it's not like FF. This, as I said, was of primary importance to us. And yes, we did make a new game, for the following reasons:<br /><br />All dialouge was rewritten, the entire sound track was rescored, all level designs were done from scratch, all the quests are entirely different, the statistics of the enemies/weapons/armors were all done from the ground up, the gameplay itself is fundamentally altered due to only have one hero ala Dragon Warrior, there are new items with different functions, every last pixel of graphics were redone, etc, etc, etc.<br /><br />How you can even say this isn't a different game is beyond me; that's like saying Half Life and Quake 1 are the same game, or Doom 3 and Quake 4. The underlying engine is the same, and yet the games themselves are totally different from just about every point you look at them.<br /><br />But anyway, I'm through with this; this thread has dived into a horrible argument based on semantics.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=1340">Sliver X</a> — Tue Oct 31, 2006 2:02 pm</p><hr />

<em>It's just that the final product is totally flawed and limited by the fact as the artists are limited by a considerable amount of contraints they wouldn't have developping their own game engine.</em><br /><br />You are so obviously not a ROM hacker. <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" /> Part of the fun of doing what we do is working within constraints. The same can be said of programming something with as limited power as the NES compared to say, oh, an x86 based PC. <br /><br />I mean, why code for something with 2KB of RAM and a 1.79MHz CPU when you can code for something with a gigabyte of RAM and a processor speed in excess of 2GHz? You code for the NES because of the challenges it imposes, the sheer nostalgia factor of doing something with that particular machine, and just the geek factor of it all. I hack games for the exact same reasons.<br /><br /><em>If you're making your game, you're then supposed to make a code that runs what you want, regardless if it is more or less inspired by existing game engines, you'd still want to have your own technical customizations regardless of the game you're doing.</em><br /><br />I'm not "supposed" to do anything; I do this as a (very esoteric) hobby. Please see my above points. Also, I am not a programmer; I've delved into several languages in my day, but you know what? I'd get bored so fast it was insane. My limited abilities with machine code (Myself and a fellow by the name of Gavin did the bulk of the assembly modifications in DXOII, though many others helped with specific issues) are mostly derived from the fact that I'm an electronics/computer engineer by training, so I can "grok" what the opcodes are doing at the physical level.<br /><br />I am primarily a musician and a writer; Thaddeus is an artist. Taking a game and for all intents and purposes making it into something entirely different aside from the bulk of the core programming made our jobs extremely easier. For what things the FF "engine" couldn't do, for the most part, we got around. There are signifigantly more code changes than you seem to realize, and only a few were beyond trivial to implement. So I don't agree that coding an entire engine from scratch to, say, scroll the screen, generate sound waves, etc would have been easier for us. Maybe for you, and congratulations on that, but I have neither the time nor interest to become that proficient with 6502 and knowledge of the NES' architecture. I wanted to make some games; I did that.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=1340">Sliver X</a> — Tue Oct 31, 2006 1:12 pm</p><hr />
