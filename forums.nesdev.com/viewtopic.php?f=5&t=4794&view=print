		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Oh this remembers me back when I had to learn all that by heart in my english courses. Now I don't pay attention to the details any longer, as the context can be enough to understand.
<br />
<br />"It's" = "It is". However I learned we would say "it is" without abbrievating only if you really insist on something. Like (sorry I just made this up in a second):
<br />- Well, my car is not broken.
<br />- Yes, it is.
<br />
<br />It would be stupid to answer "Yes, it's".
<br />"Its" is more like "his", or "her", but for an object.
<br />
<br />When you say something like "Sheakspere's language", it's in fact an abbrievation for "The language of Shekspeare". But you can get rid of "The of" thing with a simple "'s" wich make it shorter. The same goes for shops, you often say "Hammer's" instead of "The shop of Hammer".
<br />
<br />A 's can also be abbrievated for "has". You could say indifferently :
<br />- He has broken his leg
<br />- He's broken his leg
<br />
<br />This can lead to interesting ambigious cases. In Dick King-Smith's book "Harry's mad" the title could mean :
<br />- Harry is mad
<br />- The mad of harry
<br />- Hary has mad (altough this doesn't make much sense)

<br />Hey thanks! I'm actually trying to learn Japanese specifically  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /> .
<br />
<br />I have Rosetta Stone software, which is pretty good, but it's lacking sort of in the feedback aspect. Like, you don't have your mother there to tell you when you're saying something wrong like you do when you're like 2 years old. But I'll check out those links, because I really hate trying to memorize crap like in formal studies of language.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />English grammar is actually quite simple when compared to most languages... What makes english hard for me is pronunciation. There are basicaly no rules for pronunciation in english, if you consider that "laughter" is pronounced so differently from "slaughter" and the only difference in spelling is the "s". 
<br />
<br />When I see a new word in english I won't dare saying it until I hear someone else (on TV or whatever) saying it, 'cause only them I'll know the actual pronunciation. Sometimes I can't even connect a written word to a word I've heard many times on TV. Of course the internet made it all easier, with phonetic guides and audio clips, which I can seek in case of doubt.
<br />
<br />Also, the vowels sound very differently from most other languages (they seem swapped somehow - but just in some cases, because even in english their sounds vary so much), and consonants require too much tongue rolling. For example, "r" in english sounds much more like "rw", which requires much more tongue and lip movement than the clean "r" from, say, japanese.

<br />The quirks are probably there because people tried to establish rules to explain things that were created without rules in the first place. Languages are a certain way because people speak that way, so the day someone steps up and decides to dictate what's correct and what's not, they will only be able to create rules if they create tons of exceptions to go along.

<br /> My youngest son is 6 and halfway through 1st grade. Learning how to read and *pronounce* words he's never seen before is just crazy, and it seems like I'm always telling him, "Ok, this one is an exception. It sounds like this...".  Why "s<span style="text-decoration: underline">o</span>n" sounds like "s<span style="text-decoration: underline">u</span>n" and 's<span style="text-decoration: underline">oo</span>n'  like 'y<span style="text-decoration: underline">ou</span>' and not 'look' or 'took' but definitely 'g<span style="text-decoration: underline">oo</span>n'. And to look for early queues or hints in the sentence about when to pronounce 'read' as 'reed' or 'red'. Etc.
