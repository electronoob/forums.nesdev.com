We have a new project in mind which would need way more assets than the standard NROM256 offers, and I'm reading about mappers.<br /><br />There are incredibly featured mappers out there. If I could choose freely, I would choose MMC5 for our next project as its features fit completely with what we have designed. But one has to think about real hardware, as we would like our games to be released on real cartridges someday, and that's what I'm asking.<br /><br />Which mappers are the easiest to implement on real hardware (appart from the obvious (C)NROM128/256 - I need more PRG ram for levels)? Is MMC5 currently available? <br /><br />What would you do?<br /><br />Thanks in advance <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />

If you don't need anything that sophisticated there are the UxROM (mapper 2) as well as a similar one used by &quot;Holy Diver&quot; which gives you UxROM-like PRG banking, CNROM style CHR banking, and Horizontal/Vertical mirroring switching. <br /><br />UxROM is pretty good for something more advanced than NROM but doesn't require CHR-ROM banking or SRAM backup. Ofcourse you can always create your own mapper to suit your needs.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />The MMC5 is still a bit of a mystery, and AFAIK it hasn't been fully replicated yet. Support for it in popular Flash Carts (PowerPak and Everdrive N8) is partial. It would also be significantly more expensive to include in production carts than AxROM or UxROM for example, since an FPGA that can host the MMC5 costs tens of dollar (I think) while the simple logic chips for the discrete mappers cost dimes.<br /><br />Over the years I've grown fond of the simplest discrete logic mappers. They don't give you anything more than access to more PRG-ROM, but in most cases that's all you'll need. With CHR-RAM you can pull off a lot of interesting tricks, and by dynamically updating parts of it (a rudimentary form of simulating CHR bankswitching) you can show very diverse graphics throughout each level.<br /><br />Sure, scanline counters, 8KB of extra RAM and fine CHR bankswitching all sound like awesome features to have available, but the difficulty and cost they add to producing carts is hardly worth it, IMO.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">MottZilla wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">you can always create your own mapper to suit your needs.</div><br />But you'll also have to make your own emulator or modify an existing one to support your new mapper, otherwise you won't be able to test your ROM. You'll also need to understand at least the very basics of electronics in order to design something feasible.

Which, yes, is about 100× more expensive than AxROM, or 50× more expensive than UxROM, and 40× more expensive than mapper 70 (UxROM PRG + sixteen 8KiB CHR banks).<br /><br />128KiB of CHR-RAM on Color Dreams/mapper 70/oversize GNROM board are my current favorite discrete logic mappers, because apparently any new RAMs or ROMs smaller than 128KiB are basically the same cost as the 128KiB one. So you may as well take advantage of it...<br /><br />Looking around, I see a public quote for AX5202P of around 20CNY, or about 3.5$.

You will not begin programming for a mapper until you find someone who is willing to supply the physical mapper, but once you do find a supplier, it will be a while until the game is ready to be put on cartridges, and in the mean time something can go wrong (the supplier abandons the community or whatever), and you're screwed. Restricting yourself to the simple mappers ensures that the cartridges will be easy to manufacture when the time comes, no matter who does it.<br /><br />This is the reason I prefer to stick to simple mappers. I can't make any commitment to have the software ready by a certain date, and I don't want to risk not being able to manufacture cartridges when I do finish the software. The only way I'd use a complex mapper was if I had a significant number of boards with me since the beginning of development, or if I had the hardware knowledge to produce the mapper myself, so I wouldn't have to depend on anyone else.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />AxROM and BxROM use 32KB bank switching though, so you may not like that. I prefer the UxROM model with the lower 16K banking and the upper 16K fixed. AxROM you're stuck with 1 screen mirroring as well, which depending again on what kind of game and how you like to program may or may not bother you. <br /><br />But to give some examples of games that used just discrete mappers like UxROM.<br />1943<br />Castlevania<br />Commando<br />Contra<br />Duck Tales 1&amp;2<br />Ghosts 'n Goblins<br />Goonies II<br />Guardian Legend<br />Gun.Smoke<br />Jackal<br />Lifeforce<br />Mega Man<br />Metal Gear<br />Paperboy 2<br />Rush 'n Attack<br />Rygar<br />Section Z<br />Side Pocket<br />Skate or Die!<br />Top Gun<br />Trog!<br />Trojan<br />Uncanny X-Men<br /><br />Hopefully you're familiar with some of those. They span many different kinds of games but they all use the very simple setup of UxROM. All it provides is that 16K/16K split and access up to 128K or 256K of PRG-ROM with fixed 8K CHR-RAM. And again it's not hard to add some extras to UxROM if you decide you need it. You can easily go up to 512K of PRG-ROM, or add mirroring control if your game needs it to scroll a level Vertically sometimes and Horizontally other times. It's well known how to add 8K of battery backed PRG-RAM if you want your game to save data like for a RPG. If you decide you want to do any advanced CHR banking you'll probably be beyond regular UxROM into something custom. <br /><br />I do agree with tokumaru that it's not a bad idea to stick with mappers you can be absolutely sure you can build carts for. Anything using all discrete parts you certainly can. But I do think that INL's new boards should be very available for awhile so MMC3 is certainly an option.

They are otherwise nearly identical, except that BxROM can do up to 512k PRG instead of 256k with the standard 4-bit latch, since it doesn't need the extra bit for screen select.<br /><br />For examples of what single screen mirroring is capable of in expert hands, I'd suggest looking at Battletoads or Solar Jetman maybe. It's actually well suited for multidirectional scrolling, since it allows wrapping in two directions simultaneously, allowing you to use the other nametable for a status bar, for example. If scrolling isn't an issue, though, the mirroring type probably doesn't matter much.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />All good points. I guess personally if I were making a game I'd be more inclined to make something more like Castlevania or Mega Man. Cause as you know there is a severe lack of platformers on the NES. =) That and I'd rather have a fixed bank than deal with 32K switching. Not that it'd be too difficult to handle, the easiest thing would be duplicating certain things in the upper part of every bank but then that wastes memory. Memory might not be that big of a deal though. <br /><br />But obviously with discrete mappers you have lots of choices and lots of things you can expand on pretty easily. You don't have to have a MMC5 or MMC3 to make a great game.
