		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />When I try to run a ROM of the game <em>Darkman</em> (which claims to be an exact dump of the cartridge) on most emulators (Nestopia 1.36 and FCEUX for both my PC and GCW Zero (an obscure handheld emulation device)), it just goes to a black screen on startup and I get nothing else. However, when I run it on Nestopia 1.40, it runs just fine. The game doesn't seem to have any unique hardware features that most emulators wouldn't support. <br />Anyone know why that is?

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />My first guess is a bad header. Nestopia 1.40 contains a database of the correct header corresponding to the PRG+CHR of each good dump. Other emulators rely on the header in the ROM image. What are the first 16 bytes of your ROM image, as shown in a hex editor?<br /><br /><a href="http://bootgod.dyndns.org:7777/profile.php?id=665" class="postlink"><em>Darkman</em> on NesCartDB</a> says 128 KiB PRG, 128 KiB CHR, MMC1. The header for this configuration is as follows:<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">4E 45 53 1A&nbsp; 08 10 10 00&nbsp; 00 00 00 00&nbsp; 00 00 00 00<br /></div>

An emulator that honors this will never be able to run the game correctly. Byte 6 should be $10, like tepples posted, to select mapper 1 (MMC1).<br /><br />AFAIK, [!] attests that the dumped data is correct, but the header, not necessarily. Also, I don't know what the exact procedure is to acknowledge a ROM as [!], but there are cases of files marked that way that were in fact bad dumps. IIRC, there was an SNES Spider-Man game marked [!] that had slightly corrupted sprites.<br /><br />EDIT: <a href="https://board.byuu.org/viewtopic.php?f=22&amp;t=1286" class="postlink">Link about that Spider-Man game</a>.

Knowledge of NES hardware may have increased a lot since that ROM got its [!] label. I heard of many cases where [!] is used on bad dumps or incorrect headers so I wouldn't trust it too much.

It was very common to see screenshots and YouTube videos full of scrolling glitches.
