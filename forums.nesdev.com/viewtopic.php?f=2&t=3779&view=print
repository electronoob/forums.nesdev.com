		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Alrighty...  I'd like to get started in the world of NES programming.  I've done x86 assembly (yeah, I know it's different), and want to give this a go to see if I can at least do something that would run on <strong>Nintendulator</strong>.
<br />
<br />I'd like to make a <strong>basic program</strong> that would have a few simple sprites, one that could recognize controller input and do some changes, and possibly display text.  Sound and such I'd look into later.
<br />
<br />One person recommended CA65.  I don't know if any assembler is really considered superior.
<br />
<br />So, what should I do and where to start?

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I assume you're familiar with simple programming concepts, so that's not a problem. What you want to do is get a graphics editor (I personally like YY-Chr), and you do want an assembler that's commonly used (ASM6, CA65, or WLA-DX) so people can help you more easily when you have a problem. I use WLA-DX, but I hate trying to set up new things. I usually just use the same setup for every new project.
<br />
<br />You'll want to read some of the technical documents, such as Yoshi's NEStech document, and you'll want to learn the 6502. There are plenty of places to learn 6502. It's fairly simple, there aren't that many instructions.
<br />
<br />A default NES game without any mappers or anything added on to it is 40k: 8k of graphical data, and 32k of program data. The default setting is known as NROM. So if you're just making simple sprite data, you'll want to set up everything to make an NROM demo.
<br />
<br />So yeah, if you read NEStech, and MAYBE GBAGuy's tutorials, you'll be at a good start.

Other than the fact that it's been stripped from the NES/Famicom's CPU, to my knowledge very few people use it aside for scorekeeping.
<br />
<br />&amp; remember, when you start developing, if you're not using the IRQ interrupt for anything, remember to set it to a RTI instruction.  I don't know HOW long that mistake crippled me! <img src="./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" />

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Well, from my reading thus far, I've figured out that # means the value of the number and not a memory location.  $ in front means a hex number, % means binary, and no prefix means decimal.  I also apparently set up banks for graphics and code I guess...  It's a start for now.
<br />
<br />I found a bunch of the commands and made up a Notepad++ styler for them, so I got colorful 6502!  I'm sure I don't have all though.
<br />
<br />The guides I've been looking at state nesasm as the assembler, although looking at the forums, it seems to be unacceptable to use that.
<br />
<br />Some of the commands look specific to nesasm, and not to other assemblers...  like:
<br />.inesprg 1
<br />.inesmap 0
<br />.... etc.
<br />
<br />Anyway, I'll keep looking things up.  It'll be great when I can compile something with no errors.

<br />
<br />I've gotten the controller mappings into a subroutine now and it can return values for the various buttons.
<br />
<br />One thing that's really weird is that the sprite moves down and right faster than it moves up and left, even though I'm just changing each value by 1 pixel at a time...  I also like how going off screen to the right brings it back in on the left!
<br />
<br />I'm trying to write some code to have it so that you need to release a button before it can function again.
<br />
<br />I'd also like to get into background graphics, though that's a little fuzzy.

<br />I do have another question:  If I ever want to modify the BG in-game, do I need to do another full write to $2007?
