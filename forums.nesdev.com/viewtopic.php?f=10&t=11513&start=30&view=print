		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" /><div class="quotetitle">tepples wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">Let me sum up: Should ROM developers go out of their way to support NESticle?</div><br /><br />There are plenty of modern systems that don't require licensing, e.g. Android, but this also includes any cracked system that people like to run homebrew on. I've run NES emulators on PC, Mac, Linux, DOS, Android, PS3, XBox, and PS1, personally (probably a few more I'm forgetting). People will run an NES emulator on just about anything that will support it. I don't know why you keep trying to restrict this to &quot;modern&quot; or &quot;licensed&quot; or &quot;legal&quot; or things that are currently under development. NES emulation is largely illegal, and the majority of it is done with non-commercial software.<br /><br />What is out of your way?<br /><br />In my view, using an illegal opcode is an optimization of either space or speed, and it comes at a small expense of portability and possibly code readability/maintainability. In most cases, I consider an act of optimization to be out of my way. Writing straightforward, simple code is what I prefer to keep in my way. The thing is, if you've sacrificed anything for size/space that you don't actually need in the end, it's been a net loss for you. This is why I suggested a few posts back that I would normally save optimizations like this for the end of the project when I am already sure I need them. In very specific cases, you <em>need</em> what these opcodes provide, but in the majority of cases you do not.<br /><br />NES emulation in particular has a wider range of well-used emulators than any other system. Wide compatibility is difficult, and yes, I definitely think it's worth avoiding illegal opcodes for this sake. NESticle is an unfair example because it's not well-used, but there are definitely cases in ones that are (I pointed out two in NSF players). I'd have to do a large survey to find out which, and I'm not prepared to do so, but you seem to be taking a position that none of them matter for ideological reasons, I guess. I think they do matter, because people are using them.<br /><br />I also think people should improve their emulators and get the proper support for these opcodes in, but I like to treat that as a separate issue.<br /><br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">tepples wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">If VirtuaNES uses the same 6502 core</div><br />VirtuaNSF does not use the same CPU (or APU) code as VirtuaNES, or at least, doesn't appear to. I tried looking at the VirtuaNES source to gain insight into VirtuaNSF at one point, but it became clear it was pointless because they didn't match at all for what I was testing.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I agree that emulators should support the undocumented opcodes (especially since the NES only used the one 6502 revision throughout its lifespan), but I think games doing opcode checks is a bit unnecessary. Of course, I also think using the undocumented opcodes in the first place is unnecessary, so I'm biased.

At least I prefer to write the program such that it is designed for a &quot;correct implementation of the Famicom VM&quot; (of which the RF Famicom, and several mapper ASICs (even those used only on NES), are mostly what is defining it (and are considered as a correct implementation); I also consider that unofficial opcodes were not a part of the &quot;Famicom VM&quot; until the Super Famicom and SNES came out; some things do actually have undefined behavior though, such as unstable opcodes). (I do the same with Z-machine programs, although in this case very few programs that implement the Z-machine actually do it correctly even for the required subset. Therefore, it isn't specific to NES/Famicom programming at all!)<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">Kasumi wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">I haven't yet used such opcodes, only because I fear some revision of NES somewhere doesn't do what's expected with them.</div>I don't think any official revisions of NES or Famicom is, although I would believe that any that don't are probably incorrect implementations.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">Kasumi wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">I probably should start using them.

Use comments if you need to; after all they don't affect it at runtime!
