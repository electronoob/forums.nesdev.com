<br />I'm sorry about Overlord.  I ripped it ages ago when I wasn't as skilled.  I could find the init routines for some music, but each track played a single channel's sound only.  So for each song, I inited 4 different routines, one for each channel that I could match up.  Song 8 is just a glitchy mishmash of leftover channel songs that seemed to fit together.  If you can fix it up, please rip away!

<br />Unfortunately, I haven't had much luck with getting the missing tune to work in a fresh rip. I may try again here soon.
<br />
<br />With the exception of one or two rips, Jeroen Tel music drivers are hard to rip. Overlord is no exception.

<br />
<br />That's strange.
<br />
<br />I tracked the speed adjustment variables down in the code and then included them in the initialization code, using a compare since each tune has a different speed.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I tried my hand at Overlord as well. I seriously think that there's some essentially unused musical tunes in the file. I played the heck out of that game trying to access new musical numbers, but I just can't seem to find anything more than what I've got, despite knowing some additional working song values for a fact. If you find some music that's not represented here, tell me how to access it. I'm sure I can rip music init values verbatim out of practically any save state for the game, as long as the music is playing at the time in the game. Additionally, I can debug the routines to search for.
<br />
<br />Specifics on how I got the info is shown in the text file.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Excellent. That's certainly more complete than the last nsf. I wanted to tag an NSFE / M3U for it, do you think you could help supply track names? (I didn't have the patience to learn this game to try and beat it)-
<br />
<br />I can see in the text file that you've identified the tracks, but as a coding n00b I'm not sure which corresponds with which track.
<br />
<br />Track 1 = Title Theme
<br />Track 2 = (Unnamed Jingle)
<br />Track 3 = War Begins (Round Start)
<br />Track 4 = (Unnamed Jingle)
<br />Track 5 = (Unnamed Jingle)
<br />Track 6 = (Unnamed Jingle)
<br />Track 7 = Game Over
<br />Track 8 = Menu
<br />
<br />There's no need to bother with identifying sfx. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />
<br />
<br />I wouldn't be surprised if there are unused tracks, that seems to be a trend with Jeroen Tel nes music. There were 6 tracks in Beauty and the Beast I couldn't find in-game (16, 17, 18, 19, 21, and 22), and 3 from Bram Stoker's Dracula (tracks 1, 2, and 3, although they're in the sound test). 
<br />
<br />I found the latter really odd, especially since those are some of the few tracks with percussion. It seems pretty clear that track 1 is a titular theme, yet the game has no music at the title or in the intro. None at the ending credits either. I'm thinking that might've been a mistake, but I don't know how you'd miss something so obvious.

<br />The Transformers game may have been an emulation issue, because I just can't hear any difference. Try FCEUXDSP, and see if it plays nice with the track. If so, there's a newer NotSoFatso ( <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://nesdev.com/bbs/viewtopic.php?t=4653">http://nesdev.com/bbs/viewtopic.php?t=4653</a><!-- m --> ) that should play it right too.
<br />
<br />There was practically no difference at all for the Ninja Gaiden set. I only changed out the 4 banks from C010 from Shadow Warriors(C010 * 3FE0, specifically), and all other data from the Ninja Gaiden rip was left where it was.
