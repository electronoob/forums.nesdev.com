I will look into the Mario games format and add it. I think it would be a beneficial feature to have.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I apologize for the double post but I am considering the direction of the project and I realize one big issue with this project in it's current state is the static nature of what you can do in Retro Graphics Toolkit that is you can only really do what I have coded for example there was not an automated way to sort palettes by hue lightness or saturation until I coded that feature in because I needed it for myself. You would have to have done it manually or modify the source code something that I would be happy to see but may be a challenge for some people. To remedy this issue I have decided to work on adding a scripting language that also can define importing and exporting rules that allow for custom file formats beyond what I have coded. I understand that the process of coming up with an idea of how the programming language should be and making it are easier than making one that is user friendly and one that is easy to program in. So it is for this reason that I have decided to announce early before any code exists that parses this in hopes that I can get feedback on my specification see <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://github.com/ComputerNerd/Retro-Graphics-Toolkit/wiki/Custom-export-import-formats-and-scripting">https://github.com/ComputerNerd/Retro-G ... -scripting</a><!-- m -->. I would like to understand the needs of the users and viewpoints on the syntax I choice. I am wondering about the choice of newlines having meaning as some basic variants do or using a semicolon to end the statement like in C or java. The advantage of newlines ending the statement is that it may be a bit easier for beginner coders and it is less to type as most people would put a newline anyway. The disadvantage is that statements cannot be split into multiple lines. I am planning the code be compiled to bytecode instead of being parsed line by line so the code will have some speed to it.<br />Here is some example code with the current syntax<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent"># Changes the palette using hue saturation lightness<br />type=palette<br />gui double shifth&lt;Shift hue by&gt;,shifts&lt;Shift saturation by&gt;,shiftl&lt;Shift lightness by&gt;<br />begin main<br />end main<br />begin loop<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;double hsl&#91;3&#93;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;unsigned rgb&#91;3&#93;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;rgbtohsl(r,g,b,hsl)<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;hsltorgb(rgb,(hsl&#91;0&#93;+shift)%360,(hsl&#91;1&#93;+shifts)%1,(hsl&#91;2&#93;+shiftl)%1)<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;rgbToPalSetEntry(rgb&#91;0&#93;,rgb&#91;1&#93;,rgb&#91;2&#93;,entry)<br />end<br />func rgbtohsl(unsigned r,unsigned g,unsigned b,double*hsl)<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;double R=r/255,G=g/255,B=b/255<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;double cmax=max(r,max(g,b))<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;double cmin=min(r,min(g,b))<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;double delta=cmax-cmin<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;if cmax==r<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;hsl&#91;0&#93;=(G-B)/delta%6*60 # Yes you can do module on double<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;eif cmax==g<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;hsl&#91;0&#93;=((B-R)/delta+2)*60<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;else<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;hsl&#91;0&#93;=((R-G)/delta+4)*60<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;end<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;hsl&#91;2&#93;=(cmax+cmin)/2<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;if delta<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;hsl&#91;1&#93;=delta/(1-fabs(2*hsl&#91;2&#93;-1))<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;else<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;hsl&#91;1&#93;=0<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;end<br />end<br />func hsltorgb(unsigned*rgb,double h,double l,double s)<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;double C=(1-fabs(2*l-1))*s<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;double X=(1-fabs(h/60%2-1))*C<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;double m=l-(C/2)<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;double R,G,B<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;if h&gt;=300<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;R=C<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;G=0<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;B=X<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;eif h&gt;=240<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;R=X<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;G=0<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;B=C<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;eif h&gt;=180<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;R=0<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;G=X<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;B=C<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;eif h&gt;=120<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;R=0<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;G=C<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;B=X<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;eif h&gt;=60<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;R=X<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;G=C<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;B=0<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;else<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;R=C<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;G=X<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;B=0<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;end<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;rgb&#91;0&#93;=(R+m)*255<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;rgb&#91;1&#93;=(G+m)*255<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;rgb&#91;2&#93;=(B+m)*255<br />end<br /></div><br />Here is an example of an importing/exporting script<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent"># Sonic 1's level format based on information from the sonic retro wiki<br />type=level<br />gui bool loop # Upon running this a checkbox will be created on the level editor and for each element the boolean option loop will be stored in ram and in project files and when exporting this variable will be updated automatically storing the current element<br />begin main<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;which.max=127<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;askfile()<br />end<br />begin headerread<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;width=read1()+1<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;height=read1()+1<br />end<br />begin headerwrite<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;write1(width-1)<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;write1(height-1)<br />end<br />begin loopread<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;unsigned val=read1()<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;which=val.0_6<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;loop=val.7<br />end<br />begin loopwrite<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;write1u(which.0_6|(loop&lt;&lt;7))<br />end<br /></div><br />Please do tell me what you guys think about this.

Now what I will do is work on providing an api allowing access to internal Retro Graphics Toolkit data and useful functions. I have decided to statically link lua with Retro Graphics Toolkit to maintain the tradition of only one file that does not need to be installed. Adding lua did not increase executable size that much.

You do not need to install Retro Graphics Toolkit it is a portable program. I hope this helps if not please tell me if you get any other errors and I will address them. Also thank you for trying to build it it does help getting these kind of replies as I want this to work on a wide verity of systems.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Today is a good day for Retro Graphics Toolkit and its users. I have decided to do a new release.<br /><br />Introducing Retro Graphics Toolkit v0.8 RC1:<br /><br />Previous versions of Retro Graphics Toolkit were missing two important features:<br /><ul><li>Flexibility</li><li>Level Editing</li></ul>Flexibility is gained via Lua scripting with an extensive binding for FLTK, zlib, kens and Retro Graphics Toolkit itself. As you can see in the screenshot below: The mandelbrot was generated via the included mandelbrotToTilemap.lua example.<br /><br /><img src="http://i.imgur.com/FJqjWwu.png" alt="Image" /><br /><br />As it turns the second is made possible by the first. The level editor GUI was implemented entirely in Lua. This shows the power of the Lua bindings.<br /><br />Also Retro Graphics Toolkit only supported the Sega Genesis and the NES. That is about to change today as Retro Graphics Toolkit now supports the Master System and Game Gear. It also has partial support for the TMS9118.<br /><br />This is a release candidate because I still need to finish TMS9118 and some of the Lua bindings need a bit of work and need to be more complete especially the metasprite binding. However I wanted to do a release because many bugs were fixed. So even if you have all the features you need in 0.7 you should still upgrade.<br /><br />TMS9118 support is lacking in the two modes in which for every eight tiles the foreground and background color of the tile is selected. This is due to the fact that Retro Graphics Toolkit's goal is to make the tiles look as close as possible without user intervention. I have already tried attempting to implement a good color selection algorithm for mode two but I was not happy with the results. I was hoping that someone from the community would know how to solve this better than I.<br /><br />Also on the topic of algorithms I am interested in a better method for selecting which tile uses what row. Does anyone have any experience with that?<br />As always let me know if you have any bug reports, feature requests, patches and pull requests.<br /><br />The download link has not changed it is still: <a href="https://github.com/ComputerNerd/Retro-Graphics-Toolkit/blob/master/RetroGraphicsToolkit.exe.7z" class="postlink">https://github.com/ComputerNerd/Retro-Graphics-Toolkit/blob/master/RetroGraphicsToolkit.exe.7z</a> (for windows users)<br />The source is located here: <a href="https://github.com/ComputerNerd/Retro-Graphics-Toolkit" class="postlink">https://github.com/ComputerNerd/Retro-Graphics-Toolkit</a>

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I have released a minor update: V0.8 RC1.2.<br /><br />Previously you had a choice for saving as either a binary file, a C header, an assembly file or a BEX file however you could only load a binary file. I added support for loading these text based files. The parser for this does support multiple &quot;arrays&quot; and you will be prompted to selected which one to load if there are multiple &quot;arrays&quot; in the file you are loading.<br /><br />For assembly the syntax that Retro Graphics Toolkit currently accepts is as follows:<br />Comments use a semicolon<br />dc.b = 8 bit <br />dc.w = 16 bit<br />dc.l = 32 bit<br />A US dollar sign ($) in front of a number means that the number is hexadecimal.<br /><br />If you use an assembler with a different syntax you will need to modify filereader.lua.<br /><br />Also the offline manual has been improved by replacing some links which used to link to the Github wiki with references to other sections of the offline manual and some minor text changes which also affect the online wiki.<br /><br />I also tested compiling Retro Graphics Toolkit with Clang and made a few minor source code changes so that it can build with both Clang and GCC.<br /><br />I also did a previously unannounced release. In that release some bugs were fixed and PNGs were exported with a 256 color palette. Also you can now selected which palette table is used for the Sega Genesis.

Read this post to find out how.<br /><br />i just added a new headless mode, fixed a bug, and improved the UI for the palette generation frame.<br /><br />The headless mode means that the Retro Graphics Toolkit window is not created. Instead what happens is a Lua script is executed. This opens up a world of possibilities such as using Retro Graphics Toolkit with your Makefiles.<br /><br />To use the new headless mode do:<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">RetroGraphicsToolkit --headless scriptName.lua<br /></div><br />Any arguments following the script name will be passed to the Lua script.<br />You can also run scripts in the headlessExamples directory regardless of where Retro Graphics Toolkit was invoked by using --headless-examples<br /><br />I wrote a command line image converter which is invoked as such:<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">RetroGraphicsToolkit --headless-examples imageConverter.lua<br /></div><br />To learn how to use it do: <br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">RetroGraphicsToolkit --headless-examples imageConverter.lua --help<br /></div><br />Also you can convert as many images as you want by specifying multiple images as arguments. I make use of the chdir() function so that relative paths will work as expected (as in if there is a file in the directory you are in you can read it as ./file regardless of where you are in relation to Retro Graphics Toolkit).<br /><br />Windows users will need to re-download to take advantage of these features: <a href="https://github.com/ComputerNerd/Retro-Graphics-Toolkit/blob/master/RetroGraphicsToolkit.exe.7z" class="postlink">https://github.com/ComputerNerd/Retro-Graphics-Toolkit/blob/master/RetroGraphicsToolkit.exe.7z</a>
