<br />
<br />In other words if a pixel is transparent then does it count as having a higher priority?
<br />
<br />The reason that I am asking this is because in Castlevania I know that when you enter the castle you are supposed to enter it through the door using the afformentioned method. BUT it does not seem to work.
<br />
<br />If I do it so that a pixel takes priority whether it is transparent or not then Castlevania seems to work, but other games then seem to suffer. I am very confused...

If transparency does not affect the priority of a pixel then how do they manage it?

All that's relevant for transparency is whether the two low bits of the palette index are zero (the two bits specified in CHR data, as opposed to the higher bits specified by the attributes or whether it's BG/OBJ sub-palette). It's not like the "chroma key" on TV where they have a blue/green screen behind and anything approximately matching that color is transparent to the underlay.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Color 0... and ONLY color 0 is transparent ($3Fx0, $3Fx4, $3Fx8, $3FxC).  If the sprite is to draw any color other than those colors the pixel is NOT TRANSPARENT.  Whether or not the drawn pixel will be indistinguishable from the background to the user... the NES doesn't care.
<br />
<br />So if the game has a black background and a fully black sprite on top of it...  a human won't be able to tell where the sprite is by looking at the screen (since the same color is being drawn everywhere) -- but that doesn't necessarily make the sprite transparent.  It just makes it blend in.
<br />
<br />
<br />So agian... the only thing that matters when determining whether or not a sprite/bg pixel is transparent is if both the CHR bits are 0.  Attribute bits don't matter.. the palette doesn't matter... nothing else matters.  If the bg/spr is outputting color 0, it's transparent, if it's outputting color 1-3, it's opaque.

<br />I understand what you say about the human eye not being able to see the sprite if it is that same colour as the bg but please try Castlevania and you will see what I mean. Using priorities, they make the main character dissapear when he enters the door.
<br />
<br />Also is 0x3F00 mirrored to 0x3F04, 0x3F08, 0x3F0C, 0x3F10, 0x3F14, 0x3F18, 0x3F1C?

<br />
<br />After all the priority calculations, the color drawn of the screen can be from a sprite image (that has high priority, or that have low priority and is behind a transparent BG pixel), or from a bg image (if there is no sprite, if there is a sprite with lower priority that is behind a non-transparent BG pixel, etc...), if no pixel has to be shown from BG nor sprites, the transparent color will be there.

<br />The value of the color themselves have nothing to do with the priorities or transparent pixels.

<br />
<br />Actually... no.
<br />
<br />
<br />Here's the deal:
<br />
<br />$3F10 mirrors $3F00
<br />$3F14 mirrors $3F04
<br />$3F18 mirrors $3F08
<br />$3F1C mirrors $3F0C
<br />
<br />$3F20-$3FFF mirrors $3F00-$3F1F
<br />
<br />
<br />$3F00/$3F04/$3F08/$3F0C are NEVER DRAWN as part of a BG/sprite.  Never never never never... since they are the 'color 0' value of the graphic  (though they all exist, and can be used for the BG color when rendering is disabled).  $3F00 holds the "background color" which is drawn if BOTH BG/Sprite pixels are transparent.  (Note that $3F00 is the bg color only if rendering is enabled -- if rendering is disabled [both bg and sprites disabled] then it is possible for the game to use any palette entry as the bg color)
<br />
<br />logic flows kind of like this (note:  only true when rendering enabled) :
<br />
<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">if sprite pixel is not transparent<br />&nbsp;-&gt; if sprite pixel has foreground priority, render it<br />&nbsp;-&gt; otherwise if background pixel is not transparent, render it<br />&nbsp;-&gt; otherwise render sprite pixel<br />else &#40;sprite pixel is transparent&#41;<br />&nbsp;-&gt; if background pixel is not transparent, render it<br />&nbsp;-&gt; otherwise &#40;both are transparent&#41;, render color at ppu$3F00<br /></div>
<br />
<br />For areas of the screen where there is no existing sprite -- the sprite pixel is transparent.  If sprites are disabled, or if the sprite pixel is in the left 8 pixels of the screen and sprite clipping is turned on... the sprite pixel is transparent.  Otherwise transparency is determined by CHR bits of the sprites graphic:  0=transparent... 1,2,3=opaque.  If the BG is disabled or in the clipped range (left 8 pixels of the screen when clipping enabled), the BG pixel is transparent -- otherwise BG transparency depends on the BG graphics CHR bits -- same as sprites.
<br />
<br />Attribute bits and palette lookup do not come into play at all until AFTER it's determined which pixel will be displayed.
