<br />Thanks, I was actually starting to think about making forums for universal development. (That would've been a jerk/moronic move)  
<br />
<br />So anyway. GB hommebrew seemed to thrive around 9 years ago (Maybe even more than the Famicom). What happened?
<br />I'd like to discuss that.
<br />So why are hombrew roms much more abundant than NES homebrew to me?
<br />Is it just me?

<br />I wasn't calling myself a moron. I just was adding if I Made a whole forum for Development it would have been jerkish. Although if I did make one I'd have no nes section and just refer members to this site.
<br />I might actually make one. All those sections for the NES on  these forums.
<br />It'd have sections like that but for other stuff such as GB snes atari 2600 and stuff.. I know there's not much demand for info like the Nes has but I'm sure there are questions that could be sectioned off.
<br />
<br />Gosh. This is really hard to compos right now, Maybe 'cause I'm always in a hurry to finish the post.
