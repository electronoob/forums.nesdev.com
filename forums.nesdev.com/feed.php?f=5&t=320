Yeah, Nesticle is a great emulator.<br />But the problem is that :<br />- It doesn't emulate the $2005/$2006 writes during a frame correctly<br />- It doesn't emulate the $2001 register correctly (if it does at all)<br />- It does allow writing wia $2006/$2007 during rendering<br />- If you turn the screen off during a frame, change somethig and turn it on after that, the result won't be taken care until next frame<br />- Scanline's tricky timing isn't emulated well (also, I'm not sure about it, but a "sta $4014" won't take more time (i.e. Sprite DMA doesn't eat cycles))<br />- It always more than 8 sprites per line<br />- CHR bankswitching during a frame is badly emulated<br />- Most mappers are badly supported or not supported at all (for example the MMC5 can only run CastleVania3, all others MMC5 games won't work)<br /><br />However :<br />- It allows you to modify the header of any rom<br />- It allows you to show all tiles in a gird, and even to modyfy them, and, if the game uses CHR ROM, re-write it to the rom.<br />- It allows you to directly trace the code, and to manually trigger an NMI<br />- It allows you to dump the whole NES' RAM<br />(edit : )<br />- It also allows you to change the palette anywhere, and to click on a pixel on the field to know which color it was<br />- It allows you to advance frame by frame<br />- It's the only emulator as far I know that's able to turn off the BG and to show only the sprites (emulators with Name Table viewers can show the BG without sprites, however this doesn't really disable them on the screen)<br />- It runs very fastly even on old and slow PCs<br /><br />No emulator has all theese features in it, even if the emulator is pretty poor in the accuracy department. Anyway, Rew is much worse.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=38">Bregalad</a> — Wed May 25, 2005 10:20 am</p><hr />

Personally, I am only after perfect circuit-level emulation of the NES/Famicom.  The other consoles are already covered by copiers and flash carts.<br /><br />kev could make some good money by making a JAMMA converter for his board, and then make high-quality circuit-level emulations of some of the classic arcade games.  Collectors would appreciate something exactly like the real thing (i.e. not sorta-like-it ala MAME), which they drop-in an arcade cabinet.  Arcade collectors are more willing to pay a premium for their hardware.  Again, I am not talking about casual Mame users who built a craptastic Mame cabinet, but instead the types who have played, say Pacman, everyday since it was released.  These types don't care for slow booting fan cooled Mame arcade machines, which support thousands of games with buggy inaccurate emulation.  They want something that can't be discerned from an official Pacman PCB, once it is installed inside the cabinet.<br /><br />Emulation was supposed to save the classics, but typically it is so poorly implemented that it only obscures what the classics were like.  Kind of like crappy colorizations of classic black-n-white movies.  I mean, there are still people who use Nesticle, for christsakes!<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=94">Jagasian</a> — Tue May 24, 2005 12:54 pm</p><hr />

Some people don't want a bunch of consoles laying around. It's one reason I don't play as much anymore; I don't want a mess of more than one hooked up, but that limits me to a subset of games (not that any new-fangled machine will ever replace the original console, not on my turf).<br /><br />And I doubt Nintendo minds competing with sellers of used games.

Yeah, I figure it sounds too good to be true.  Very interesting though.  Nintendo would be competing against their own products (in used game stores).  If someone has an NES/SNES/N64 already, they might as well pay the usual $5 or less for the original cart (a few games excepted).  So I'm guessing it would be more targetted towards people who don't have or don't want to have the older hardware, or just want a portable version. (edit: portable? oops, I was confusing it with the GB micro)<br /><br />I'm not too happy with the idea of having to buy the same game twice, heheh.  Plus going to emulation (assuming it's not incredibly good emulation) is like downgrading from CDs to tapes, heh.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=10">Memblers</a> — Mon May 23, 2005 6:17 pm</p><hr />
