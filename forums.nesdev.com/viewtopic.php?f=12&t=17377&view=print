Regarding bsnes-classic”<br /><br />Hello everyone. I was highly reluctant to come back to NesDev after a heated dispute between me and some of the forum members here on NesDev last year, but today, I will make a one-time exception.<br /><br />AWJ made a fork of bsnes v073, which he called “bsnes-classic”. In it, he revived the Qt-based GUI and backported low-level emulation of the uPD96050 coprocessor used by F1 Race of Champions II and Hayazashi Nidan Morita Shougi from bsnes v074. Since then, he has backported a few of higan's emulation accuracy improvements, all to an ancient version of bsnes, all for the sake of a feature-rich GUI based on a bug-plagued toolkit. bsnes-classic was further forked into the debug-oriented bsnes-plus.<br /><br />I believe that this practice is unsustainable. As higan's accuracy increases, so too does the effort needed to keep track of its changes and backport them. Most importantly, bsnes-classic preserves a badly-aged XML-based manifest format for cartridge folders; today, higan uses a slimmer syntax named “BML” for manifests, and many years of experience have shaped the syntax into what it is today, so that ROM hackers have greater control over their memory maps than they did back in the days of bsnes v073. Unfortunately, the convenience of the Qt GUI means that ROM hackers such as Tom (Far East of Eden: Tengai Makyou Zero) must force themselves to hack the older XML manifest which, given its age, is prone to errors and failure. The situation is not unlike ZSNES, by far the most popular and simultaneously the most bug-filled emulator, whose tremendous userbase holds back progress with translations and ROM hacks that won't work on real SNES hardware.<br /><br />Therefore, I seek to do the exact opposite: to forwardport the Qt GUI and make it work with higan v106 and later versions. I have documented my efforts <a href="https://board.byuu.org/viewtopic.php?f=4&amp;t=2061" class="postlink">on byuu's message board</a>. The current working name for this fork is “bsnes-classic”, exactly the same name as AWJ's fork, and that is not a coincidence.<br /><br />It cannot be denied that what I am doing is predatory; I am writing a higan fork with exactly the same name as another fork and with the same goals, with the sole exception that it be based on higan v106 instead of bsnes v073 and use the former's BML manifest format both with traditional ROM files (both headered and headerless) and with cartridge folders. Therefore, I believe I owe it to AWJ to inform him of the existence of my fork named “bsnes-classic” so that he can share his opinion on whether I should keep using the name and what he will do with his fork.<br /><br />And therein lies the reason for my return to NesDev, despite my better judgement: AWJ has been offline from NesDev since October, and neither has he shown any signs of life on GitHub. Even on Freenode's #retroarch channel, hunterk searched and could not find him. If I cannot get in contact with AWJ, then the future of bsnes-classic (my fork, not AWJ's) and the ideals that come with it look bleak.<br /><br />I hesitate to ask NesDev about this after the way a few of its key members have treated me in the past, but for now, I will steel myself against any flames that come my way. Does anyone here on NesDev know about AWJ's current status within the emulation community as a whole?

I already have a local Git repository using the name, documenting all of my changes as I migrated to each successive version after v073. But if all else fails, I could choose to use the name “bsnes-Qt” instead. <a href="https://github.com/Themaister/bsnes-Qt" class="postlink">Another fork by that name exists</a>, but its maintainer is Themaister (of RetroArch fame) who is certainly still active, and it only has a grand total of 3 commits since its creation at the end of 2010.

The answers are 1) probably but you'd have to ask him, and 2) I'm not sure (it sounds like you've exhausted your avenues, which means you've done your due diligence in attempting the Right Thing(tm)).  One thing I will mention is that sending a PM on nesdev, unless the user has changed their settings otherwise, by default will send an Email to the account holders' Email address with the subject &quot;New private message has arrived&quot;.  If you haven't tried that, I'd suggest it as a final avenue.<br /><br />On the subject of project naming conflicts: meanwhile, <a href="https://github.com/rakyll/boom" class="postlink">we have other software that changed its name to <em>avoid</em> name conflicts</a>.  Open-source etiquette and netiquette would strongly advocate you not use the name of an existing project (it doesn't matter if it's dead or alive/active), but obviously nothing *requires* you do that.  Though I will say, your choice of words (&quot;It cannot be denied that what I am doing is predatory&quot;) will certainly not sit well with some folks.  But in the end, do whatever you wish.

Rather than replace it, you're more likely to breed unnecessary confusion, not to mention that it just comes off as hostile.

Naming issue aside, it's nice to see the Qt-based GUI running the newest higan v106 SNES core. Also nice to see the Qt5 migration is in progress as well.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Well, I sent a PM to AWJ this morning (shortly before 09:00 PDT). As of 17:00 PDT today, he hasn't responded.<br /><br />The name “higan-classic” misses the point of this fork. I am reviving the Qt GUI that bsnes v073 had, and it will only be compatible with the Super Famicom (including the Super Game Boy). Recall why byuu renamed his emulator to “higan” in the first place: in addition to the Super Famicom, he created emulators for multiple other consoles (Famicom, Game Boy, Game Boy Advance, and more recently the WonderSwan, Mega Drive, Master System, Game Gear, and PC Engine), and the name “bsnes” became increasingly inaccurate. The rename happened at v092.<br /><br />I don't really like the ideas that play on Snes9x's name. It is not Snes9x that I hope to replace. Snes9x is at least as accurate as bsnes-performance yet has vastly superior speed because it is not held back by inappropriate use of libco.<br /><br />There might be some merit to using names such as “bsnes-vintage” or “bsnes-legacy”, but I'll wait a little longer for AWJ's opinion before I make a decision.<br /><br />You guys aren't wrong for calling this tactic hostile, but I think you deserve to know why I'm doing this. Take a look at the XML manifest for the English translation of Far East of Eden: Tengai Makyou Zero:<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">&lt;?xml version='1.0' encoding='UTF-8'?&gt;<br />&lt;cartridge region=&quot;NTSC&quot;&gt;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&lt;rom&gt;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &lt;map mode='shadow' size='0x100000' address='00-0f:8000-ffff'/&gt;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &lt;map mode='shadow' size='0x100000' address='80-bf:8000-ffff'/&gt;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &lt;map mode='linear' size='0x100000' address='c0-cf:0000-ffff'/&gt;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &lt;map mode='linear' offset='0x600000' address='40-4f:0000-ffff'/&gt;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&lt;/rom&gt;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&lt;spc7110&gt;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &lt;ram size='0x2000'&gt;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&lt;map mode='linear' address='00:6000-7fff'/&gt;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&lt;map mode='linear' address='30:6000-7fff'/&gt;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &lt;/ram&gt;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &lt;mmio&gt;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&lt;map address='00-3f:4800-483f'/&gt;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&lt;map address='80-bf:4800-483f'/&gt;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &lt;/mmio&gt;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &lt;mcu offset='0x100000'&gt;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&lt;map address='d0-ff:0000-ffff' offset='0x100000' size='0x500000'/&gt;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &lt;/mcu&gt;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &lt;dcu&gt;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&lt;map address='50:0000-ffff'/&gt;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &lt;/dcu&gt;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &lt;rtc&gt;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&lt;map address='00-3f:4840-4842'/&gt;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&lt;map address='80-bf:4840-4842'/&gt;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &lt;/rtc&gt;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&lt;/spc7110&gt;<br />&lt;/cartridge&gt;</div><br />In the manifest above, it's not immediately obvious where the program and data ROMs end and where the expansion ROM begins, and how all 3 ROMs should be mapped. The method they used to add the expansion ROM to this manifest is a blatant hack. bsnes v073's manifest format was not designed to accommodate this use case.<br /><br />That Tom and his hacking team had to carefully study this ancient manifest format and come up with this hack, all for the sake of a user interface that died long ago... how else can I describe bsnes v073 other than “the ZSNES of cartridge folders”? No one should ever have to force themselves to write manifests such as the above just for the sake of a few holdouts that don't like the direction higan has taken.<br /><br />And if my ZSNES comparison is not enough for you, then compare it to Internet Explorer 6, which for years was the dominant web browser (and still is in China), holding back innovations in web design until 2014 when Microsoft finally ended official support for it.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I've been aware of bsnes's revival since the day it was revealed. I'm actually looking forward to its release; bsnes will include a multithreaded PPU that has the potential to be faster than the current compatibility/balanced PPU, yet has the same compatibility. That is to say, it will not support Air Strike Patrol or the 2 Player mode of Uniracers like the accuracy profile does. If and when this is accomplished, I will replace the balanced profile's PPU with the parallel PPU in my fork.<br /><br />Besides, I am not personally a fan of Qt as a GUI toolkit. More than anything, it is horribly plagued with bugs that have to be worked around, and it is very easy for some bugs to slip into public releases, which was a frequent problem with bsnes versions 040-073. Anyone who favors stability over extra features should use bsnes instead when it comes out.<br /><br />The reason I persist in continuing the Qt GUI is for its many extra features, such as rewinding, movie recording/playback, screenshots, extra archival formats such as GZip (might support JMA if I can figure out its license compatibility), and obscure filename extensions such as SWC and FIG. All of which will be excluded from bsnes. If I don't do this, then the badly-aged XML manifest format will remain popular long past its expiration date (5 years in the past when v092 introduced BML and separated the SPC7110's program and data ROMs).<br /><br />Also, I'm not entirely certain of this, but it looks like while my Qt fork will support both standalone ROMs and cartridge folders, bsnes will support standalone ROMs exclusively, though this is unconfirmed.

I also see no reason to cede ground on battles we've definitively won (nobody uses FIG/SWC/JMA anymore.) I still want to <em>try</em> and advocate for moving the scene forward instead of staying stagnant forever, but my activism is burning out as I get older. I hope this will be compelling to people who just want to play games, and aren't on Raspberry Pis or cell phones.<br /><br />I'm sure it won't ever replace the endless forks of bsnes and Snes9X out there.<br /><br />I guess we'll see what people think once it's released and supports at least all the primary desired features.
