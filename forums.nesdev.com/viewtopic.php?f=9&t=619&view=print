		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I'm thinking about making a cart dumper using a small micro with a lot of IO pins and an USB interface.  One of the hurdles I'm running into is the connector to plug the game cartridge into.  I could use one of the 72 pin replacement connectors for the front loaders, but that seems like a huge pain mechanically.  I think what I want is more like the connectors used in the top loader or the game genie.  Does anyone know where I might find something like that.
<br />On a related note, does anyone know the size and pitch of the pads on these connectors?  or the exact thinkness of the board?  I may be able to get Amphenol to custom make some of these for me if I can tell them exactly what I want.

<br />How did you open up your game genie?  I haven't pulled the stickers off mine, but I don't feel any holes for screws under there.  I think the plastic was sound welded together, the seam looks pretty solid.  Did you have to dremel it apart?

<br />
<br />For the record, I just purchased 3 of these connectors, and they do not "work fine".  The offset in pitch of 0.04mm is enough to offset the pins too much.  In addition, the pins on the ends of a NES cart are slightly wider than the rest.  This causes pins 1 and 2 to be shorted together with these connectors (as well as pins  35 and 36, 37 and 38, 71 and 72).
<br />I can still take a connector off of a GameGenie, but it sucks to have wasted $20 on these connectors.
<br />
<br />edit: all four sets of pins on the edges aren't always shorted together.  It depends on how you seat the cart into the connector.  I think if I always seat it farthes to a specific side, I can force pins 35/36 and 71/72 to be shorted.  Since I'm not using pins 35 and 71, that isn't an issue.  I'm doing a full continuity check of the rest of the pins just to be sure.  I'm expecting the difference in pitch to introduce at least 2 other shorts.
<br />
<br />edit2: continuity check shows severe problems.  The pitch difference causes a "linking" effect after about 30 pins (30 * 0.04 = 1.2mm).  The result is pins 29-36 are all shorted together.  Looks like using a GG is the best solution here.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I've found a workable solution for this problem.  I did a lot of research on this, so I figured I share the results, though it seems like common sense in hindsight.  If you need a NES 72 pin connector for a project you can
<br />
<br />- Desolder the connector off a toploader or a famiclone.  Depending on what kind of famiclone you may get a surface mount connection instead of through holes.  I want through holes for my project, plus I don't want to desolder if I don't have to.
<br />
<br />- Desolder the connector off a game genie.  This is a pretty good option, but the GG connector must be mounted on the edge of your PCB, which is really hard for prototyping.  If you're building your own board, maybe this is ok.
<br />
<br />- The 60 pin Famicom adapters are a standard pitch, so you can buy them from Digikey or some place.  You can then use a 60 to 72 pin converter.  This gives the advantage of being able to accept both Famicom and NES carts, which is nice.  However, the pins you are missing include most of the Expansion pins, which I probably want as extra i/o lines for any custom RAM/Flash/EEPROM carts I want to reprogram.
<br />
<br />- The 72 pin "replacement" parts are really easy to find, but they are meant to go in a front loader, and have the whole spring mechanism attached.  If you haven't seen one, it's basically a "U" shaped adapter with two 72-pin connectors on it.  One of them slides over the edge of the main board inside the NES, and the other accepts the NES cartridge.  Turns out, both these connectors use the crazy 2.50mm pitch.  The connector that the cart normally goes into is mechanically not suitable because of the spring loading mechanism, and it's tilted up at a strange angle.  However, the board connector is a perfectly normal card edge.  Using a dremel and some wire cutters you can cut the adapter in half, and throw away the oddly shaped connector.  Now you have a right angle NES cart connector, with plastic mounting bracket and everything.  Of course the 72 pins that go into your PCB are not a normal diameter or spacing, but I don't think that's as big an issue.   This is what I'm going to try to use on CopyCart.
<br />
<br />Anyway, hope this is useful for someone, or at the very least entertaining <img src="./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" />
