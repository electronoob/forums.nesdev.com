		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Can you paste a nonworking playlist entry for me? The way the loop logic works is kinda weird, I'm wondering if there's a bug or I just need to document it better. It should work like this:<br /><br />filename::NSF,[song],[title],[time],[loop],[fade],[loopcount]<br /><br />[time] = length of intro + one complete loop<br />[loop] = length of loop (or if it ends with a -, start time of loop. if using - the [time] parameter must be filled)<br />[loopcount] = number of times to loop<br /><br />Note the if your [time] and [loop] aren't set to match the song the loopcount isn't going to help. (I personally find it easier to leave loop and loopcount as default and just set the time for the length I want.)<br /><br />Can you attach or link to the Power Blade 2 NSF that isn't working for you? I can find 3 rips of it and they all work fine (though one of them has VRC6 and VRC7 enabled for some reason).

I don't experience what you do <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/viewtopic.php?p=103835#p103835" class="postlink">here</a>.  If you want me to make a video of what I experience just let me know.<br /><br />Have you tried deleting your in_yansf.ini from your Plugins directory and using the one included with 2.3b2?  This might explain your looping oddities/behaviour/etc. too, but I'm not sure.<br /><br />If you roll back to a previous NSFPlay release (and if so which one), does the problem go away?<br /><br />The sound difference you hear between the two versions is that the strong bass/drum line is missing in the &quot;JP&quot; version.  To me, that would indicate whoever did the ripping probably didn't do the right thing (some APU registers not being initialised correctly, etc.); AFAIK the two versions have the exact same music.<br /><br />Edit: With regards to the sound difference between the two NSFs -- it's related to the DMC channel (which is used for the drum/bass line).  Someone either ripped the NSF wrong or is initialising some APU registers wrong.

It's labelled &quot;spectrum analyser&quot;.  We had a conversation about this problem before, where the issue turned out to be due to the sample size being fed to Winamp was too big so it resulted in a delay between the spectrum analyser results and what you actually hear.  What I'm saying is that this problem (the effect itself) happens if you use a sample rate in NSFPlug that's lower than 44kHz.<br /><br />Question: why is there an intentional delay (referring to the Delay setting under Keyboard) of any sort to begin with?  What purpose does this have?

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Yeah, it compensates for the audio latency. Ideally I would use something like waveOutGetPosition and synchronize, but since it's a winamp plugin, the plugin doesn't have any direct access to the audio system (it just fills a buffer on demand).<br /><br />As for Winamp's visualizer being out of synch at other samplerates, I have no idea what to do about that. The last time the fix was to make sure the buffer length was 576 samples, which Winamp likes best for historical reasons or something. I dunno what to do if it isn't synched at other samplerates...
