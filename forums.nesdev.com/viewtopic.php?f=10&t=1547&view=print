		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Well, this should be very common question among the "Newbie Help Center," although, I havn't seen (at a glance) anyone that has asked the question "How can I make a NES rom, and what programs do I need?," so I guess I'll have to ask it. I guess the reason why I'm asking this is because I want to start a sort of project... and the project consists of making a NES game and putting it into it's natural rom format.
<br />
<br />Basically, I need to know what programming language, along with some help in how to write it (like a documentation on the language, and especially what program I should be typing this programming language in). Examples would also help :D.
<br />
<br />Oh, and if there is a such thing, I might also need a disasembler for roms. What better way to learn than to take apart another NES game and see how it works :].
<br />
<br />I would also ask about sprites, music, and how to make them both, but if there is a disassembler, then there would be no need on how to piece them into the rom.
<br />
<br />And if I missed anything that is needed in making a NES rom, please let me know. Again, I'm a "Newbie," so overexplain if possible, and don't be afraid to repeat youself.
<br />
<br />Thanks in advance,
<br />--Cartridge
<br />
<br />(PS: Now that I think of it, I know a way to repay any kind of help. Any basic and extraordinary help will be put into the credits of this game. I'm serious (unless if you don't want me to). It's just that I need serious help, and I want to give credit when due. Thanks again)

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />for the NES, using a high level language is not realistically feasible.  you will have to learn 6502asm and use an assembler.  and as for disassemblers, for me i learned more from tracing a rom in a debugger and watching as it runs in an emulator.  looking at a disassembled rom tends to be confusing.  as for graphics and sound, etc., learn assembly before you try and tackle NES specifics, it will make things alot easier down the road.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Hmm, ok. Now, lets say I wanted to make a game with characters from different games... and putting them in, well, different games (example: using the first level in mario bros.... but with samus). That's the best way I can describe my vision, but if it's too vague I can emphasize more later. Anyway, is that at all possible, or would that require something other than 6502asm?
<br />
<br />(Ok, I might have found a site (<a href="http://www.programmersheaven.com/zone5/cat440/15550.htm" class="postlink">http://www.programmersheaven.com/zone5/cat440/15550.htm</a>) to download the "6502asm"... but I don't know where to begin... first the "help" file doesn't explain how to begin creating the rom. Is there some sort of link to the actual language to use? 
<br />
<br />Also on the nesdev site, there are some roms that include a "source code"... is that compatable with 6502asm?

<br />
<br />Not without some changes, a lot of assembler programs work differently (often in minor ways like the name/abbreviation of a command, sometimes not).  View the source to a programs here and it probably says what assembler it uses, if it doesn't say, ask here.
<br />
<br />Unfortunately there's not a standard assembler that everyone in NES development uses.  Here's what a lot of demos/games on here use:
<br />
<br />DASM: some older stuff uses this, Chris Covell's releases, good and easy to use except for the lack of an .incbin command.
<br />x816: old, needs win9x or DOSbox to run.  good assembler otherwise, though not a lot of source-released stuff uses it.
<br />NESasm/Magickit: a lot of people started with this one (including me), and it has some annoying bugs like not reporting some errors.  But it'll generate iNES headers to make .NES files at least..
<br />cc65: it's good, it's what I use, it has a learning curve but a lot of advanced features.
<br />wla-dx: looks good, also looks like it has a bit of a learning curve too.
<br />There's a bunch more besides those too.
<br />
<br />
<br />As for putting other characters in different games, the easy is to exchange the tiles and modify the palette (no programming needed).  But if the sprites are different sizes it would be very hard to do.  They'll definitely have different animations, so it'd look a little weird and I dunno about modifying a game's animation data (could be hard or easy, sounds like a pain though).  I hacked the princess from SMB2 into SMB1, and that was pretty easy.  Just by replacing the tiles and changing the palette.
