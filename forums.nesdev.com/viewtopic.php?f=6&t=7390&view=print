		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Wow, that's absolutely fascinating! The composers that used Family Basic, I wonder if they also wrote their engines with it, or just used Family Basic as a front-end for composing. (Or maybe the music engine was built into Family Basic? <img src="./images/smilies/icon_surprised.gif" alt=":o" title="Surprised" />)
<br />
<br />Heh, if you'd like, you can add me to that list -- I compose using raw hex code, and then I rely on my assembler to insert pointers (for jumping, looping, etc).
<br />
<br />Sometimes, I'll "sketch out" a song using any number of tools (ModPlug, FLStudio, etc) before converting it to my engine, but <em>most often</em>, I'll simply compose directly in hex, assemble the music engine + data to an NSF file, and hear my work from that.

<br />I would love to have a MIDI&gt;NES converter. David Warhol has one but he's too lazy to try getting the disks to run. Every time I've asked, he's given me some excuse.

<br />If you have done music for a game then I'll put on you there, though I'd prefer your real name on the list, but if you don't want that, that's fine. I wrote music for an NES game too for Gil-Galad. I'm just not sure if he's actually going to try and complete the game or not.

<br /><strong>In short -  He wrote most everything out in text files that were subsequently compiled with Eurocom's own 6502 assembler.

What we lacked in resources, we clearly made up for in boundless determination.<br /><br />Luckily for us, our parent company (at the time) employed the skills of a really talented electronics engineer, Richard Alton, who managed to reverse engineer (and build) some flash-ROM cartridges and together with an old 6502 editor/assembler, "PDS", we had ourselves a rudimentary development kit!<br /><br />I remember myself and Tim Rogers (now Technical Director at Eurocom) visiting the languages department at Sheffield University with the photocopied Japanese NES manual and with the help of two Japanese girls we deciphered a lot of the technical information.

Tell us a little bit more about your program Compact Editor, and how it basically functioned. Was it capable of tracking / composing a complete song from start to finish for the rest of your non-ZX 8-bit soundtracks?<br /><br />AG: <a href="http://www.worldofspectrum.org/infoseekid.cgi?id=0018925" class="postlink">Compact Editor</a> was a simple music sequencer, based on tracks, blocks, and instrument definitions, inspired by some Amiga computer trackers like NoiseTracker. A complementary PC program named “The Sourcer” was used to transform the binary data created with Compact Editor into raw source code, as a text language that I could understand (basic notes, lengths, etc). This way I could then edit the songs into its fullest detail.<br /><br />- - -<br /><br />AG: My entire process of making music for 8 bit consoles can be elaborated as such- First I used the Compact Editor to compose the basic idea of the song, with its different parts. Later the song was transformed into source code using The Sourcer, and then as a plain text file I put the small details and riffs into the song, as well the drum track and the final sound for each instrument. This process was done by changing the source code, compiling, sending it to the console, listening, and so on again and again until it sounded as I intended (or I ran out of time!). Finally, if required (most of the time), the compression stage took place, which consisted of finding and reusing small fragments of the song to make it use the least amount of memory possible.<br /><br />Many times I adapted the sound driver for each game, adding new commands and effects, drum sounds or whatever. It was an evolving thing. I don’t know how the other musicians did their soundtracks, I’m still wondering, but don’t think it would be much different.</div><br /><br />Further anecdotes on working with the NES-<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">AG: ... The NES had something special. The triangle wave channel was a good source for percussive sounds and boomy basses, although it wasn’t very usable for other kind of sounds. I really enjoyed doing the music of Asterix &amp; The Smurfs. Solstice by Tim Follin was my inspiration at that time. I had to learn 6502 and I liked it much more than I would have imagined.<br /><br />AG: ... When I was writing Asterix for the NES and learning the sound chip, I didn’t find information about the right frequency values to use for the notes (the frequency table), and the values of my Game Boy driver didn’t work. So what I did was create a small program for the Game Boy to play each note (12*8 notes if I remember correctly), and another program in the NES to lower and raise the sound frequency with the controller. Then I played each note in the Game Boy and tried to mach its frequency on the NES “by ear”, to find the right value for the registers. How brute is that? Well it worked, but now when I listen to my NES soundtracks I notice that some notes are a bit out of tune.</div><br /><br /><strong>3.

[Dr. Stephen Clarke-Wilson] who was not only a talented musician and programmer in his own right created a small conversion program in Cakewalk which enabled midi files (.mid) to be converted to ascii (.asc) files.

<br />Hi everyone! I thought I could share some vintage chiptune code with you.
<br />
<br />This is the source code for the NES Game Over song of Asterix. All was written with <strong>macros</strong>. Each macro corresponds to an hexadecimal value or chunk of assembly code, this way it was much easier to program since you could write <strong>real words</strong> that had some meaning, instead of numbers and raw assembly code.

<br />If there is enough interest I could write some comments and details about what does all that code mean. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I do the exact same in my unfinished project, I use .db statements but with definitions instead of using plain hex numbers. In the end it looks like that :
<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">SucessTri<br />.ifndef PAL<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;.db SetTempo, $88<br />.else&nbsp; &nbsp;.db SetTempo, $a3<br />.endif&nbsp; &nbsp;.db SetAttack+6<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;.db Duty<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;.db SetVolume+2<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;.db SetSustain<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;.db SetRelease<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;.db SetOctave+4<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;.db DblCr+Mi, DblCr+Mi, DblCr+Sil, DblCr+Mi, DblCr+Sil<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;.db DblCr+Solb, DblCr+Sil, DblCr+Lab, Bl+La<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;.db Stop<br /></div>
<br />Of course if you don't understand french you won't understand it, but the notes are called Do Re Mi Fa Sol La Si instead of C D E F G A B (it's just very much easier to me to make them in my language).
<br />So basically each .db satatement is either a command followed (or added) with an argument, or a note (or silence) added with a duration. This is just how my format works though.
<br />
<br />PS : A second NESdev comeback from a former NES musician, that's great, welcome !

<br />We have Do Re Mi in English, except they're relative to the key in which the piece was written.
