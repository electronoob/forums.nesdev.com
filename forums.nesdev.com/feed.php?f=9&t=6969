I've made lots of progress in the serial routines for this new cable design ($4017.D4/D1/D0 for input, $4016.D1/D0 for output). At some point I'll be posting a page describing the hardware spec for the cable, another page with serial routines to use with it, and an updated bootloader page for the new design.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=17">blargg</a> — Mon Oct 11, 2010 1:06 pm</p><hr />

Yeah, identifying devices would be handy, that sounds like a cheap way to do it.<br /><br />Now I'm really curious about having the PIC check the Zapper.. that would be quite a convenient service for the NES program.  With it having really precise timers available (perhaps up to 80mhz), I wonder if it could determine any kind of horizontal position.  Vertical position would be easy.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=10">Memblers</a> — Wed Sep 29, 2010 4:26 pm</p><hr />

Yeah, I think they really do have those pins like that so you can read it externally by watching the pin.<br /><br />That makes sense about ignoring them. I can't really see a problem in supporting serial on D4, given that a read routine must support D0 anyway, and thus not play well with a controller connected and bring pressed. So I'll have it support D4, D1, and D0 unless anyone comes up with any problems. Then the low-cost cable will put it on D0, yours on D1, and a pass-through cable on D4.<br /><br />Oh yeah, an interesting idea I had for controllers that could tell the NES what type they are, based on how Apple did for its older RGB monitors: tie D3 and/or D4 to either ground, +5V, or Strobe. That gives 5 ID values, aside from them being unconnected. Might come in handy for one of these cables or something.<br /><br />RTS/CTS isn't part of the standard right now. It's just meant for minimal PC to NES really, so the above covers it. Interesting idea for having CTS on $4016.D2. I <em>have</em> figured out a really nifty way to handle output on D0 and D1, if/when we move into working out a standard for NES to PC.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=17">blargg</a> — Tue Sep 28, 2010 6:35 pm</p><hr />

Sounds good, I had planned to ignore those bits, so the zapper and powerpad can be used normally.  Actually I haven't really looked at the NES mainboard to see how that's hooked up, for example could I poll the zapper (in the controller port) from the expansion port?  That would be cool, but I doubt it's that easy.<br /><br />The PIC32 UARTs support CTS/RTS, however if I have one dual-purposed as a selectable UART / SPI slave, then SPI clock is the same pin as the UART RTS out.  What would work however, is connecting the PIC's CTS input to the NES exp port OUT2 ($4016.d2 output from NES).<br /><br />On a side note, that CTS pin is shared with the SPI's slave-select, so by that perhaps the NES will be able to do SPI without controller-clocking interference (with a simple mod to the controller checking code).<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=10">Memblers</a> — Tue Sep 28, 2010 5:42 pm</p><hr />

OK, I've just about got this new scheme supported for the boot loader. Memblers, what are your thoughts on also having D4 be one of the allowed inputs? Your hardware would of course just put serial on D1.<br /><br />To recap, software would have to support serial on $4017 D0, D1, and D4. D0 because the standard controller using that, and every cable has to connect that. D1 for your setup, and as a bit that isn't connected on the NES controller, so it won't interfere.<br /><br />D4 as an alternate bit that IS connected on the NES controller, to allow a second controller pass-through cable that connects D0 to the controller normally. This leaves D3 free to be connected to the CTS output from the PC, if ever desired. By having serial on D4 rather than D3, code written specially for D4 only could use CPX $4017 to put the state of D4 into the carry bit, without the state of D3-D0 affecting the result.<br /><br />The main question is whether supporting $4017.D4 for input poses any problems for you, or other potential problems. Would you be using D4 as some other status input that could change on its own?<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=17">blargg</a> — Tue Sep 28, 2010 9:39 am</p><hr />

Yeah parallel port has been a pain.  At one point I bought a PCI LPT port adapter because I had so many parallel devices, but the adapter quit being usable after I left Win98.  I had all kinds of ungodly problems using the LPT version of CopyNES with most of my PCs.  Now I use it for an EPROM emulator, EPROM burner, and nothing else.<br /><br />But, that old PC-to-NES schematic by sepi for using the LPT port, that's on this site, that was the first electronic circuit I ever built.  It worked, too.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">yagababa wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"><br />So what i gather out of these discussions, the retrousb CopyNES, wont work on famicom without doing some mods on it, and then, <br />do anyone have a good schematic on where to do the connections on the FC board (im using a A/V famicom), and there's a few games i want dumpd, thats no more, at the moment at least,,<br /><br />- uaganana<br /></div><br /><br />kevtris, who designed the CopyNES, has one installed in an FC.

If you don't have it already, perhaps you could ask retrousb if they can provide one without the CPU pin header (so you wouldn't have to remove it).<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=10">Memblers</a> — Fri Sep 24, 2010 4:05 pm</p><hr />
