There's nothing rare, unique, odd, or even &quot;prestigious&quot; about this game, yet the prices are stupid.  Because, like I said recently in an unrelated thread: it's all about money.  Other than some niche communities, these types of elevated prices are what you'll find on most commonplace auction sites.  I don't sell stuff at these prices; ethically I just wasn't meant for this type of world.</div><br />The problem is that if you sell something for a fair price, chances are that someone will take advantage of you and resell it for a higher price or something. Unless you personally know the buyer and know they care about the things they buy instead of how to turn a profit off of everything.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />That's pretty interesting! <br />But I've read somewhere that instead of making the not planned SNES happen, the Sega's console made its already planned launch to speed up.<br />Also I've heard that there was an chip that was supposed to be on the SNES' main board, but ended removed due to time constraints. <br />Would this be the SFX or the Mario Kart's DSP?<br />This can be total folklore too...

This is why you can't use NES Game Paks in a PlayChoice nor Super NES Game Paks in a Nintendo Super System.
