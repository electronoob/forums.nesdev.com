		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />The other reason to reset in allpads, other than to get to the low-level screen, is to provide for hot-swapping controllers, even if the menu doesn't allow selecting an activity using a particular set of controllers. It currently supports only an NES or Super NES controller or Super NES Mouse in port 1 or a Zapper in port 2. Hot-swapping controllers isn't that reliable on the NES, often causing the CPU to stop, and pressing the Reset button breaks it out of stop and begins probing the newly connected controllers.<br /><br />The other option is to include a subset of the functionality of allpads and Holy Mapperel in the menu itself, as I sketched in <a href="https://forums.nesdev.com/viewtopic.php?p=123674#p123674" class="postlink">another POST</a>. A flow that's a bit less James Brown and a bit more <em>Mega Man X</em> might help in other ways, as a way of distancing ourselves from the quite Bogas way the soundtrack of <em>Action 52</em> was put together.

I thought references was the whole point.<br /><br />Forgive me for being blunt here, but if it has something to do with unprovoked copyright compliance, then as what point have we complied enough? I know I said &quot;keep it legal&quot; but in my mind fully following the thought of not doing anything that <strong>might be</strong> infringing will cause me tear down <strong>everything</strong> and do nothing thereafter. For the simple facts are; all creative work is derivative, and nothing is new under the sun.<br /><br /><br />Nevertheless I'll read through the allpads code to see if such a waiting intro will be necessary, from what I understand now, it very well might.

Thicke</em>), which lowers the bar for stylistic similarity. I imagine that the entire collection is going to be promoted to a much larger audience than the individual volumes were, and some of them are likely to have friends that work in the music industry. How much would it cost to hire a lawyer to review the final version so that INL, the publisher, doesn't get bankrupted by statutory damages, attorney's fees, and court costs?

I hope it'll be a refreshing take of the idea, and that it would ease up your concerns a little bit.<br /><br />As for the risk of liabilities, Maybe it's a bit unfair to always reflect these hypotheticals onto INL. Perhaps I should just form a LLC so that I can say in these situations &quot;I understand the risk, and I will deal with it when the threat comes&quot;. (I might soon form a LLC for other reasons in my life, but we'll see)<br />Right now the strategy will be to comply with <em>directed</em> action like polite requests and not so polite C&amp;D letters, and to avoid obvious common pitfalls of copyright infringement like ripping sprites/sfx in Nintendo licensed games. For the not so obvious stuff like this case of a NES imitation of a 2 second sampleed loop of a sample of a recording of music, I guess we'll just add one more layer of artistic deriving. Maybe after enough attempts it could pass as original.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">How much would it cost to hire a lawyer...</div><br />&quot;If you have to ask how much it costs, you can't afford it.&quot;<br /><br />The non joke answer is I don't know, and I don't know if that will help or not. Maybe I should phone EFF or someone like them to know for sure.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I'm not really seeing the appeal of a Master Version.<br /><br />It seems to me that if it is a planned thing, it would result in a decrease in demand for earlier versions (&quot;Why should I pick up A53v4 or A53v5 when I can wait until A53mv comes out and get all the <em>good </em>games?&quot;)<br /><br />If it's intended to be something along the lines of a &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; album, waiting until the ratio of included games vs excluded games is a bit more exclusive might be better? Assuming an average of 20 titles per release and five volumes released prior to the Master Version, 53 titles is still over half of the library, not very exclusive.<br /><br />Although our situation a little unique (an anthology of releases from anthologies?), looking into the criticisms and successes of Greatest Hits albums in the music industry may be beneficial:<br /><ul><li>What's the typical inclusion to exclusion ratio at the time of release of a band or musician's first commercially or critically successful Greatest Hits release?</li><li>What's the fan response been to the inclusion of exclusive tracks on a GH release? </li></ul><br />So, I'm wondering:<br /><ul><li> What motivation would a user have to purchase intermediary or back versions when they know this &quot;master version&quot; is in the near future?</li><li> What motivation would a user who already has previous versions have to purchase the Master Version? (Will there be exclusives to it? If so, how would inclusion of said exclusives be determined?)</li><li> What's going to happen with the NESdev competition entries from the current year of Master Version release? Will they be on A53v6 (and not included on the Master Version). Will some of them also be included on the Master Version? Will the Master Version be released in direct competition to that year's competition anthology release?</li><li> What's the plan for future NesDev competitions after the release of the Master Version? Do future versions of Action 53 continue to be released? </li></ul><br />And to respond to the previous question regarding profit. I say it should all go back into the loosely labeled competition fund of &quot;community approved projects&quot;. It'd be weird to start having funds generated by A53 sales suddenly be used for other purposes when, for years, all A53 sales have gone toward the same fund.

If I'm in the wrong for improperly using the brand of &quot;action53&quot; please tell me.<br />I'm doing this because the goal product (the combined volume) was what my motivation on participating from the start, and for various reasons I feel like this is a &quot;now or never&quot; opportunity.<br /><br />The lack of appeal I heard is the reason why I kind of wanted to distance this a bit from the compo cycle (which is a great thing that's going on), and be neither a strict superset nor fully a subset of the numbered volumes. While I do feel like the current ratio of 1:1 for included games vs excluded games is good mix, I am still trying to pull from other sources. Maybe that'll make this a better exclusive mix? Already in my draft list, many notable things are missing like most of the compo winners from volume 3. Additionally most of volume 1 is included, which would be good for those who haven't been able to get their hands on that yet.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">M_Tee wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">What motivation would a user have to purchase intermediary or back versions when they know this &quot;master version&quot; is in the near future?</div>With the exception of volume 1, which is out of print, all the back versions combined have at least twice as many titles, and all the cool box art and posters that come with those releases.<br /><div class="quotetitle">M_Tee wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">What motivation would a user who already has previous versions have to purchase the Master Version?

I'll consider any and all suggestions, and adjust my judgments when right to do so.<br /><div class="quotetitle">M_Tee wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">What's going to happen with the NESdev competition entries from the current year of Master Version release?
