Obviously, Bunnyboy seems best by people's standard, and I am wondering if there's the best tool list to do, so I made a list if anyone could help me out:<br /><br />-Writing : Notepad ++<br /><br />-Music : Famitracker<br /><br />- Graphic : YY-CHR or Aseprite<br /><br />I am not sure if there is more, so helping me find more tools would be nice.

There is also my own Farbfeld Utilities programs &quot;ffbit&quot; which can convert graphics into NES/Famicom format (and &quot;ff-uniq&quot; if you want to get rid of duplicate tiles).<br /><br />For text editing I use vim, although you can use any text editor.<br /><br />Another program for using is ppMCK, although that is intended for writing .NSF files rather than music for the game. Another program for music is Pently, which I believe is suitable to make music for a game, as well as for NSF.<br /><br />For assembler many prefer ca65 or asm6, although I still like NESASM.

If you want to program on your own you can look at tutorials such as dougeff's  <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://nesdoug.com/">https://nesdoug.com/</a><!-- m --><br /><br />Either way it's going to take a while. Get to work and when you have a technical question that you can't solve you can ask here for clarification. But be ready to get responses like this if it's clear that you haven't been reading enough. This is a rewarding hobby that takes a lot of time from reading and trying things out yourself.
