But stuff like <em>that </em>wreaks of macros. Yeah, they might be slow, but lets be honest here - 65x source code gets a bit too expanded and affects the readability. Macros clean this up and make things easily readable/understandable/compact/etc, as well as some other benefits. They waste a little space and waste some cycles, but if the code is in a <em>non critical</em> area - then no harm no foul. I mean, if the example you posted only represents about 0.1% cycle usage per frame - then does it really matter? I would be more concerned with how they optimize high level stuff to function faster on the processor's design (the organization/layout of data, how it can be accessed, etc); how it can be tailored or tweaked to function faster on this specific ISA. As a developer, I'd probably only start cycle counting on code/loops/etc that have a real impact. <br /><br /> I used to think similar; why did developers write crappy or unoptimized code - when they could have easily done <em>this or that</em>. But I came to realize, developers had different priorities and constraints. As a homebrewer or hacker, I have the time and dedication to highly optimize my code. I'm not so much worrying about deadlines, or that the game design more take a drastic internal design change that negates my previous optimizations. And even if those designs did change, I have the time to easily re-optimize.<br /><br /> In my opinion, this is where the real difference lays between the 68k and the 65x ISA. While you can theoretically highly optimize both, the <em>median </em>performance of average code will almost always perform better on the 68k; you get really nice performance for <strong>no optimization </strong>. <br /><br /> On a side note to this, it seems developers were way more opt to optimize for graphics than optimizing cycle counts/code. Visuals just have more of an impact; more bang for the buck. Well, at least with Japanese developers. Euro developers at the time, seemed to be concerned with both - they just lacked in game design (IMO).

Even shitty LJN video games were made by people.

I feel like one of the main problems with homebrew games is the artwork. (You certainty won't see anything Metal Slug quality.) I feel like that maybe with homebrew projects, people should work together more often in order to bounce ideas off each other and help each other to make a more commercial-quality games.
