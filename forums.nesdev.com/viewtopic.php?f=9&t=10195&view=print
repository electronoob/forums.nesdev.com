However, I read the code from it, and tried copying it to another 12F629 chip and it didn't work. Are their chips locked, or is there some way to copy the code off so I don't have to spend the $4 on a $0.50 chip?

Additionally, all the information gained by the de-capping and reverse engineering of the CIC was shared publicly here in the forums.  If you wanted to independently write your own implementation of the algorithm and put it on a PIC12F629 you are more than welcome to - I'm guessing $4 is much easier option.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Yes, but the guy who's selling them for $4 bought the rights from the guy that did the work (kevtris).  Not that there's anything wrong with that though.  The person that did all the work was only indirectly supported by the purchase of the $4 CIClones.  From what I've heard Kevtris shared the hex files so people could make their own as well, but that changed once retrozone bought sole rights.<br /><br />There have been at least two other people who have re-designed the cic to fit on the attiny13a.  Krizz's should work just as well, I believe it's for the attiny13a as well.  He doesn't have the same pinout as JCIC, but Krizz's code is open so you could recompile to match the pinout if desired.<br /><br />If you only want 1-2 CIC's and don't have an avr programmer then yeah, $4 each is a better option.  AVR programmers are only ~$20 so it's a pretty small investment to make $0.50 CICs now that's to the guys who made their design open.
