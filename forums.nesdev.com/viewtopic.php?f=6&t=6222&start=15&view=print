(Can't get any more accurate than that)
<br />
<br />.. It could be much worse though. You could have a scream that sounds like the Playstation/Nintendo DS version:

It's nice that even the fast DSP (which the Java version is based on) still plays it correctly.

Previously played songs can be gone to via the Prev button. Click Stop to pause/unpause. If you check Playlist, when you click on a song it adds it to the list without stopping the current song.<br /><br />The GUI is crap, because I don't use Java and my development machine is inadequate for Java development. The underlying library is clean, so I'm hoping someone can write a better front-end. Contact me and we can work on this.<br /><br />Internally, it supports uncompressed files, gzipped files, and zip archives. It caches the file at the URL of the current playing song, so for example playing several tracks from the same NSF or from the same zip archive is fast and doesn't involve any re-downloading.<br /><br />Please don't share the URL, as it probably has problems and I don't want massive bandwidth usage. Please let me know how you like it, what it needs, whatever. I need someone who uses Java regularly to take over the front-end and make it non-crappy.</div>

<br />
<br />There aren't any meta functions for playlists or track names embedded in files. My idea was that you'd build the appropriate JavaScript  to add all the files from an album, using some database or other program. This gives you complete control over presentation and track length, without the need for a complex interface in the applet for selecting what to play.
<br />
<br />I do need to add an addFile() function that doesn't play the track immediately (basically acts like Playlist checkbox is checked, regardless of whether it really is). I also noticed that the automatic next track code is commented out (and of course this doesn't do any automatic end-of-track silence detection, as I assume you specify an appropriate song length already). I had lots of problems with the front-end on my old iMac running a really old version of OS X (which is the newest computer I have, sadly). We need to find a Java programmer to work on the front-end.
<br />
<br />It would be cool if someone provided a 7z and/or RAR reader for Java, then this applet could play NSF music from all the archives out there. I cringe at the thought of a RAR reader in Java, allocating 40MB or more just to access a file.

<br />
<br />Oddly enough I linked it the same way your example states. It's not a big deal, I mean archiving the NSF files speeds up the playing delay time due to download speed (I'm capped) anyway.
<br />
<br />I was wondering if it had RAR support, I never did try..but it's not a big deal.. if it can save space and just have ZIP support, that should work just as well.
<br />
<br />Any thoughts on adding a PSF loader to your library? Hehe. Kidding of course. That's probably way too much, and to think some PSFs use libraries, you'd have to definitely load the instrumentation file before anything would play..which I guess wouldn't be too hard, you'd just have to add an extra string.
<br />
<br />Anyway great work. I'm hoping for a better GUI in the future, but a lot of people need to get wind of this app before it will probably get the support it needs.. perhaps make an announcement on zophar or something?

<br />
<br />I really need to find someone who can take over this project, at least everything except the emulation code. I don't have what it takes to move this much farther forward. I've been sitting on it for almost two years now, so at least it's seen the light of day.

<br />I extracted Game_Music_Emu_Java.zip to a folder, then created "test.html" in the folder. I've experimented with files both extracted and not, with various parameters, but I never hear a peep from the player.

<br />Note: I couldn't get tsst's site to play either, but then it suddenly started working. Mine still doesn't work.
