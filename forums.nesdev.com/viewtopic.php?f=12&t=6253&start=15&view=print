<br />
<br />Yeah, and wow it was at least 10 years ago.  I had forgotten about it for a long time, but I still get comments about it every now and then, I guess it's kind of an underground hit, heheh.  I didn't know that stuff was even on their website still, reading the comments page on there is hilarious (for both songs).  If you've heard the version they have on there though, please forget you ever did, and listen to the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qZxXhwCW6Xg" class="postlink">correct version</a>.  At some point at OCRemix they re-recorded it and fuxored it, I kinda feel bad for the people who hear it, haha.

<br />Your "x" was number 35 on OC Remix, one could say you are one of the founders of OC <img src="./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" /> From just looking at it, of all the OC Remix songs I have only about 40% are still in my playlist. And "x" is one of it ^^ Please go ahead and create a comeback song <img src="./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":-D" title="Very Happy" />
<br />
<br />Sorry for OT. Let's just say I'll keep the sound engines in mind if I try SNES programming next time <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />
<br />
<br />edit: I just heard the difference in both songs. How could that happen? Did you ever try to resubmit your song? Or was this (especially the organ) something you fixed after submitting it? One of the guys wrote that there was a version of "Grim Reaper" with a real ending. Is that true?

<br />
<br />I never resubmitted it.  The one with an ending just had a fade-out at the end, it was probably the one I sent to vgmix (site no longer is around).  It sounds different because I made in FT2 (which originated the XM format), but a lot of XM players get things wrong.  I looked on my drive and found other ones I had sent to vgmix as MP3s, I put them here if you want to check them out.  It's all really old stuff.  <a href="http://membler-industries.com/music/remixes/" class="postlink">http://membler-industries.com/music/remixes/</a>
<br />
<br />There's also this dusty old corner of the website, that has most of these in XM and other tracked format <a href="http://nesdev.com/music/" class="postlink">http://nesdev.com/music/</a>
<br />
<br />I'll definitely do some remixes sometime using the <a href="http://nesdev.com/bbs/viewtopic.php?t=6586" class="postlink">synth</a> that I've been making.

<br />
<br />Wouldn't you be screwed when it comes to sound effects if you used XM2SNES or Modlite? For a non-interactive demo that's fine, but in a game you'll usually want to have some sound effects that are triggered whenever the user takes some specific action.

I'm not exactly sure how that would be implemented in the code, though.  Probably would need modification to the player of some sort.
