It would be easy to hack the game to run proplrely in PAL and write it on a custom modified cart (I've done that with FF2, wich was even simpler since the textboxes are normal so I just had to hack the effect for screen fading to time correctly on PAL). However, a commercial FF1 cart would work badly. Also, message speed only change how long the message are shown, so even higher message speed will keep very long animation and just show the text for so few time you won't have time to read. It's a bit annoying sometimes, fortunately this was fixed in FF3 and higher. However, my custom FF2 carts need serious patience to be played on real hardware because battle animation is slow ! After a dozen of minutes this gets incredibly depressing.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=38">Bregalad</a> — Tue Dec 19, 2006 12:08 pm</p><hr />

Well, the game will still be technically playable (acording to Nestopia), but with a lot of effect that screw up and with ALL messages parially rendered. Also, a lot of patience would be needed in battle, it is alredy very slow in NTSC even on higher speeds, but in PAL the thing is only worsened.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=38">Bregalad</a> — Tue Dec 19, 2006 10:24 am</p><hr />

Yes, that's true; it isn't reproduced in FCE Ultra, so I was a little surprised when I first played FF on a cart. I'm not sure that it wouldn't work on PAL, though, and even if it didn't that's only one minor special effect whose absence went completely unnoticed by me.

Were I to get into this I'd go more along the lines of the early-90s shareware model, putting a demo ROM (but a full-featured demo that actually gives you an idea of what the game's like) on the Internet and selling the complete game in cartridge-only form, and include a notice with the cart that explains why pirating such a game is not cool (as opposed to ROM dumping of out-of-production games) and asking buyers to not distribute any ROMs they dump. But that's just me; you could certainly put the whole thing up for download, and if it's good I'm sure lots of people would want a copy on a cartridge. (The fact that I played Final Fantasy on an emulator first but still shelled out $20 for the cartridge testifies to this.)<br /><br />As for label printing, there's special label paper available for standard printers; it's thicker than normal printer paper and adhesive-backed, typically used for mass printing of address labels. The stuff I've seen doesn't come with the nice shiny finish of real cart labels, but I have seen printer paper with such a finish, so I wouldn't be too surprised to find it in adhesive-backed form if you know where to look. Boxes can also be done in a printer on lightweight cardboard (although you'd have much better luck with a laser than with an inkjet, simply because feeding cardboard through a printer that bends the page would be an iffy thing) and assembled by hand with a little creative folding.<br /><br />In short, with the revelation of the resin-casting thing, I'd say that all the tools to make a homebrew NES cart into a low-budget small business exist, if you have the time to devote to it.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=1013">commodorejohn</a> — Mon Dec 18, 2006 12:38 pm</p><hr />

<div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"><br />Another problem is what will the custom cart look like, and are there any games good enough to want one?<br /></div><br />I hope Dragon Skill will heheh. In all objectivity I think no current homebrew games are worth it up now (but mybe that will change until soon), but your power pack is seriously worth it. I bet a lot of non-dev people would love getting a such system, and nesdev people will even more.<br />Until now I've just planned to release the ROM of my games with instructions on how to modify actual carts for harware guys. Now I'm more and more seriously thinking to release the ROM, the instruction for modify actual carts, and to put some carts with homemade ciruit in them to sell. I've no experience selling however, and I must complete a game anyway. However, it would be great to sell copies of the game soon after its online release. So people can try it under emulation, and just play it only in emulation if they don't bother. Hardware guys would be able to modify their own cartridges without paying too much (only the price of their material). And the people who have no hardware knownledge nor material and that bother less paying than playing under emultion could just buy actual carts. I don't know how well it'd sell. I think I'd get problems it if would sell too well, getting not enough componant and cartridge cases, and getting too much old games' PCB without knowing what to do with them. Also, I don't know how I'd make labels and/or boxes. I think I can made labels with paper and paper glue (already made that), but they can be scratched easily, and reveal the old label.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=38">Bregalad</a> — Mon Dec 18, 2006 12:16 pm</p><hr />

Don't resin molds have the downfall of being fragile though? Not sure entirely.

The cost of doing your own resin casting is pretty low, unless you value your time  <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br /><a href="http://www.tapplastics.com" class="postlink">Tap Plastics</a> has a good website of products and good stores if you are in Calif.  First you need the mold materials, most likely <a href="http://www.tapplastics.com/shop/product.php?pid=61&amp;" class="postlink">silicone rtv</a> (room temp curing) parts A and B.  Then you need the <a href="http://www.tapplastics.com/shop/product.php?pid=75&amp;" class="postlink">clear resin</a> and the <a href="http://www.tapplastics.com/shop/product.php?pid=40&amp;" class="postlink">hardener</a>.  Total cost of $40-50.  Shouldnt need any additives or thinners for the nes cart.  Should also have at least accurate measuring cups and preferably an accurate scale like a postal one.  Using exact measurements and recording each attempt makes it go faster.  Each page has a link to instructions on using the product.  Of course most of the stuff is probably toxic so do it outside if the weather isnt cold or find somewhere ventilated.<br /><br />Maybe next month I will have some free time to try doing it all again.

I am not an expert but I have paid for a few molds ($3200 for a part thats ~1 cubic inch) so I know the process.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">commodorejohn wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"><br />Moreover, why would an injection mold cost so much to make? As I understand it (correct me if I'm wrong; as I said, I'm no expert on plastics,) it's just a piece of material with the case shape stamped into it and a small hole for the injection of plastic, coupled with another piece that provides the other side of the shape; sounds like something that could be made in a kiln, or shop class - not something I'd expect to go into the thousands of dollars.<br /></div><br /><br />Thats the basic idea, but actually doing it is more complicated.  The main part is the injection molding machine which has pressure of 20-100 tons to make sure the plastic makes it everywhere in the mold and so air bubbles are crushed.  To survive that the mold has to be solid aluminum which means you need a mill to make it.  Compared to making the mold and the time on the machine, the manual labor and materials cost is pretty much nothing.  The high minimum parts is simply because it takes a lot of time to set up and clean out the machines.  Each part only takes a second to inject so they dont want 15 minutes of setup then 3 minutes of usage.<br /><br />Making the NES cart more simple will help slightly, but the main factors in mold cost are size and number of big flat edges.    Cant change the size of the NES cart so the price will most likely be fixed.  Flat sides can more easily warp when the part is cooling so having some bumps doesnt increase the price.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">commodorejohn wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"><br />oh, a couple of guys run this on the cheap out of their garage.<br /></div><br /><br />Yes there is a cheap way to do it if you dont have access to big machines.  Instead of injection you can do resin casting.  Basically you make the part you want, then put it in a box and fill the box with urethane or silicone.  Then you cut it open and take out your part.  Now you can pour a resin or epoxy into the mold.  It helps to have a vaccuum pump to take bubbles out of the resin and you have to pour carefully to fill everything.  Letting the part harden will take hours so you may want to make multiple molds.   The cost is far less (&lt;$50 to get started) but getting production quality parts is very hard.<br /><br />The coolest part about this way is you can easily find crystal clear resins.  I did this way a couple years ago to make clear case parts for the Apple Newton.  It took many many MANY molds and pours before I had any usable parts that were complete, dried hard instead of mushy, didnt have bubbles, and didnt have big lines were the mold was cut open.  Getting screw holes (dont even bother with threads) is hard so the NES cart would be easier if it was glued together.<br /><br /><br />Another problem is what will the custom cart look like, and are there any games good enough to want one?  I am still thinking of making one for my PowerPak, but that cart wouldnt be usable for other people because of the slot for the CF card.  A custom cart would still need to fit the big boards, limiting what you can change.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=228">bunnyboy</a> — Mon Dec 18, 2006 10:48 am</p><hr />
