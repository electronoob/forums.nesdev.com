I've even found one YM2149 emulator that seems to flip-flop between treating noise period 0 as 1 or 32 depending on which VGM pack I feed it, with no obvious mechanism for it in the source! I'd be willing to write it off as a bug if fixing it didn't make one or the other of the two packs sound very weird.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=7168">Rahsennor</a> — Sat Mar 24, 2018 8:55 pm</p><hr />
