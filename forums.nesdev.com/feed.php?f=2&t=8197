There are only two common boards that support that: A*ROM (#7) and S*ROM (#1). T*SROM and E*ROM also support it but are much less common, though rewiring any T*ROM to act as T*SROM is about as simple as rewiring it to take EPROM.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=9">tepples</a> — Wed Oct 12, 2011 7:25 am</p><hr />

I just use the window method. There's a column of about 32 pixels in the center of the screen in which the player can freely maneuver without the camera moving. As soon as they go beyond the edge of the area, provided the camera isn't locked in place for a certain event, the camera will only move so that the player is not outside of the edge. The player won't be centered or anything like that. It works quite nicely, as the window in the middle of the screen is really small and you don't notice that you're not exactly centered. I feel like if you were exactly centered at all times, the camera would be jerky and it would be hard to make sense of what's going on when you switch directions or make subtle movements when things are flying at you.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=138">Celius</a> — Tue Oct 11, 2011 10:45 pm</p><hr />

With actual camera there is a thing called composition, and keeping an object always in the center is actually not the best idea. Look at any movie or TV show, like news - it is not a common case when a person is in the exact center.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=4205">Shiru</a> — Tue Oct 11, 2011 10:50 am</p><hr />

You're right. I thought Super Metroid had a lot of large multi-axis scrolling rooms, but after consulting a map I can see that there are fewer of them then I had remembered.<br /><br />But still. The game does have its own ways of addressing the issues raised in this thread. And anybody interested in exploring them can mess around with a Super Metroid editor, some hacks, and the extensive documentation of the inner workings of the game.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3993">RLError</a> — Tue Oct 11, 2011 9:16 am</p><hr />
