To do maps, you'll HAVE to make your own format.<br />I think that the metatile thing is good (so you have one number, that can access different group of 2x2 tiles, and each one would have it's own color and collision). When decoding a map, put all the metatiles of the current map in RAM (or rather SRAM because it's larger), and decode the one you need, when it's time to write them to the name table, you should have provisions of code to write them column per column and line per line, including attributes. When the player or a NPC is moving, you should get the metatile collision before allow him to move, so it will move only on a walkable field. Doing some more complex collision is probably needed (to make your character able to be hidden behind the background, etc...)<br /><br />With this methods, your maps will probalby have an enormus size. So you'll need to compress them with RLE, or by creating larger groups of 2x2 metatiles (so 4x4 tiles), or something. Use your imagination.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=38">Bregalad</a> — Thu Oct 06, 2005 9:32 am</p><hr />

The easiest sort of pseudorandom number generator to implement on a 6502 is the linear feedback shift register (LFSR), which basically involves taking a CRC of a seed followed by a whole bunch of zero bits. Every time you cycle the LFSR you get one bit. Cycle it enough times to get a random number whenever you need one. The smallest practical LFSR is an 8-bit one discussed in <a href="http://www.biglist.com/lists/stella/archives/200412/msg00047.html" class="postlink">this post to the Stella (Atari 2600) mailing list</a>.<br /><br />For more information, <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=6502+random+number" class="postlink">ask Google</a>.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=9">tepples</a> — Wed Oct 05, 2005 7:16 pm</p><hr />

Yeah, I learned how to do it inderect indexed with y, i think its called. I did that to use CHR RAM instead of ROM. And by the way, this is kind of a tricky question I have. How would I make the concept of random with 6502? because say the buster sword does about 80-249 damage, and you randomly pick one in there. Maybe NESHLA has a random() type thing in it. I'm currently writing the engine for our awesome game. It will be great! It's gonna take a long time to write the engine though...<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=138">Celius</a> — Wed Oct 05, 2005 6:37 pm</p><hr />

Thanks, I understand it better now, but this doesn't answer to my exact question, because I can't see why you would mean "generating asm file", you mean generating data, right ? It wouldn't generate code, or would it ?<br />If so, it would probably insert :<br />.db $0f, $11, $21, $30 for an example of a palette. This is okay, but let's say you're encoding 256 maps for your games, each one having a hundred of .dbs.... It's pretty crazy to do it like this, scince doing it via an .incbin and pass trogh an external .dat file would be more clear, proper, etc....<br />Aside of that I think a such thing would be very good for make things more confortable, but wouldn't it be pretty hard to do (I mean make a win32 application run correcly isn't a piece of cake, is it ?)<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=38">Bregalad</a> — Wed Oct 05, 2005 9:41 am</p><hr />

Go to the map editor. Make a map. Click on save map, or whatever will be there. You'll go back to the Asm file tab, there'll be map data done in asm for you. Do you understand? Is there anything you don't get? It will be the same for pallete editor, text editor, etc. Forget I ever said anything about any binary file.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=138">Celius</a> — Tue Oct 04, 2005 2:24 pm</p><hr />

I'm going to make my IDE so I can edit the map and stuff, but it will do the asm code for me, so I don't have to really do asm too much. And sorry to do this on such short notice, but I think we should use NESHLA. I'm sorry, if you wrote the sound engine in WLADX, it won't be too hard to convert to NESHLA, will it? Sorry about that, I can't really use WlaDx. I like NESHLA, because it's C freindly, and it has many features.

About the menu graphics, I've got some fair recommendations to you.<br />You want to do magic materia (geen, $29), invocation materia (red, $05), talent materia (yellow $28), support materia (pink $03) and associative matteria (blue $22). But basically a materia is a colorfull sphere and reflects light. So, to have better graphics use some dots of different luminosity to have it looking spheric, not flat and make such palettes :<br />$29, $22, $30 &lt;- green materias uses color 1 and 3, blue ones uses 2 and 3<br />$05, $28, $34 &lt;- use this for red and yellow materias<br />$03, $xx, $30 &lt;- uses this for pink matteria and possibly something else<br />$00, $10, $20 &lt;- use this for you cursor<br /><br />But, you can use theese palettes as well to draw cloud's face, for example the palette used for yellow materias could be used to draw his hair, and the palette for blue materias could draw his eyes, or his clothes.<br />Now, if you want more customness, you can make the cursor be another color than gray and use the palette of a materia or be drawn in BG. That wouldn't really change the game, and you can use a custom palette that would be different in function of the selected character.<br />Also, in the main menu, there would be room for three custom sprite palette, and the cursor could use the fourth one. If you prefer do fixed palettes (this is simpler to code), you can use the exact same palettes as on the materia screen to draw your faces.<br />If you also want a part of them to be drawn in BG, you can still also use either the custom mode (3 free BG palettes in main screen), and do the portraits in graysale mode, or do a fixed BG palette for all portrait, that would reduce the amount of possible color, but that won't forcely affect the quality of the faces, and that enables you to draw all portraits with their color in PHS screen. Else, you can just show the characters, not the faces, like in FF6.<br />Finally you can have 4 palette techniques : fixed BG and fixed sprites, fixed BG and custom sprites, custom BG and fixed sprites, or custom BG and custom sprites. The only restriction is that you cannot use the gray color as you like for the cusor on materia screen if you use custom sprite palette.<br /><br />About the IDE, I don't exacly see any advante on generating a binary file to be .incbin'ed. I think that you had problems earlier while inbin'ing a binary file, but that doesn't meak that this method sucks, scicne it's the EXACT equivalent of using .db<br />I think that if you use correctly .incbin, there should be no problem. But delete NESASM and pick up a better assembler, you'll have more features and less troubles (even if you need to learn how its directives works).<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=38">Bregalad</a> — Mon Oct 03, 2005 9:26 am</p><hr />

I am using materia as sprites, you can see in the chr file I gave you. thankfully you'll only see 1 pallete on screen for the portrait when materia is visible. In the materia changing screen the sprite palletes will be like this:<br />$??,$??,$??   <br />$29,$05,$28  <br />$03,$22,$FF   <br />$00,$10,$20<br /><br />the question marks are whatever colors the character's portrait are colored with, and the middle ones are materia, and the last one is the pallete for the hand/icons. I know the BG pallete I'm going to use:<br />$3F,$01,$10,$30<br /><br />so yeah, I could make it so there are 8 colors per portrait! if I have three left. What would I use the other palletes for? Okay. My IDE, I think I didn't explain well. It would have a map,battle,text etc. editor, but it wouldn't make a binary file to incbin in your code. It would make a binary file to get the current state of how all the maps look and stuff, but it wouldn't really have anything to do with the game itself. There would be a tap that says "asm file", and it would be the tab you click on to look at your asm file, of course. but what the IDE would do, is as you go along, it encodes data into your asm file. Like say there was a pallete editor, and you clicked on the tab that likewise, said pallete editor. there would be a screen with all the colors on it , and you click on which ones you want. Say I clicked on $3F,$30,$26, and $24. I would go back to my asm file tab, and there would be a segment that says:<br /><br />pallete:<br />         .db $3F,$30,$26,$24<br /><br />Sound good? do you understand? it writes asm code for you, as you keep editing. and it would make a binary file that keeps your map/text etc. info, so when you open the IDE, your still at your current place, if you know what I mean. I'm sorry, I need to learn how to talk. Well, I hope you understand that, because I think that's what I'm going to use. I would of course write the engine to the game first, and then the data that's encoded into the asm file would be engine friendly, and work well with the engine. Tell me what you think.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=138">Celius</a> — Sun Oct 02, 2005 1:11 pm</p><hr />
