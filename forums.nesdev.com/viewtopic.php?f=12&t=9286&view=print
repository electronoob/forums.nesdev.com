		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />As I understand it, the difference between LoROM and HiROM memory models on the Super NES is roughly analogous to the difference between UNROM and BNROM on the NES: same capability, slightly different memory addressing scheme. Someone recently held a Super NES video game development competition, and some of the entries were LoROM and others were HiROM. Is there a noticeable advantage to one memory model over the other?

Since banks are 2x wider, we could fit a ROM twice as big for a constant # of banks where ROM is mapped in. I was under this impression but I might have been wrong.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />As always, I try and discourage using these terms as much as possible. Along with the special rules for S-DD1 / &gt;4MB games, you end up with terms like &quot;ExHiROM&quot; and &quot;ExLoROM&quot; if you choose to go that route. Better to just describe the actual behavior, it's not that complex.<br /><br />Actual mapping is a lot more complicated. There are hundreds of variations to where ROM/RAM appears on the bus and how it is mirrored. Since this board is primarily about making reproduction carts, that's a somewhat important detail.<br /><br />For one example, Ys 3 mirrors RAM to $70-7f:0000-ffff, but Fire Emblem Thracia 776 maps RAM to $70-7f:0000-7fff, and ROM to $70-7f:8000-ffff. Both games will break if you reverse that. Yet both are considered to be LoROM.<br /><br />Many games map ROM to both $00-3f,80-bf:8000-ffff and $c0-ff,40-7f:0000-ffff. Some do not map $80-bf and/or $c0-ff at all (SuperFX games), some do not map $40-7f at all (actually, most don't. Tales of Phantasia and Dai Kaijuu Monogatari II put stuff there.)<br /><br />There are also &gt;2MB games that map the contents to $00-7f:8000-ffff and/or $80-ff:8000-ffff. So don't treat A22 as being significant here (eg don't presume $c0-ff is always a direct mapping of the ROM in 64K granularity.)<br /><br />The way I like to frame this is the behavior of address pin 15, or A15.<br /><br />&quot;Linear&quot; is where A15 is -omitted from- or -not connected- to the address given to the ROM chip. Each address possible to reference is a linear byte in the ROM. I say the ROM contents are addressed in &quot;linear&quot; fashion here.<br />Bus $008000 = ROM $000000<br />Bus $00ffff = ROM $007fff<br />Bus $018000 = ROM $008000<br /><br />&quot;Shadow&quot; is where A15 is -connected- to the ROM address pins. Since the ROM is always in $xx:$8000-ffff on the bus here, it's always high. So in effect, you can't access the low 32KB of each 64KB bank from these regions, you have to access that data via $c0-ff or possibly $40-7f. I say that the data provided on the bus is a &quot;shadow&quot; of the linear regions in $c0-ff,40-7f.<br />Bus $008000 = ROM $008000<br />Bus $00ffff = ROM $00ffff<br />Bus $018000 = ROM $018000<br /><br />Hope that helps.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />So let me see if I have the coprocessor-less configurations straight:<br />LoROM: 32 KiB banks, PRG A15-A21 = CPU A16-A22<br />HiROM: 64 KiB banks, PRG A15-A21 = CPU A15-A21<br />47 Mbit: One 2 MiB LoROM at banks $00-$3F and one 4 MiB HiROM at banks $40-$7D<br /><br />LoROM is called LoROM because it's intended to be accessed starting at $008000 and going up. HiROM likewise because it starts at $400000, which is higher than $008000. But if I were making up the terms, I would have called them &quot;32K banks&quot; and &quot;64K banks&quot;.<br /><br />As I understand it, just having read about it and not tried it, a HiROM game can use the 2-byte addresses to write to MMIO ports (PPU at $21xx and CPU at $43xx) as long as the code is running in the second half of a 64 KiB bank. This works because $40-$7D is mirrored down to $00-$3D. And given that in theory a properly abstracted program is going to be doing direct access to I/O registers in a very small part of the program, this shouldn't be too much of a constraint. The first half of each such bank can be used for big blocks of data.<br /><br />I just asked which is &quot;better&quot; because for future compos, the organizer could specify whether entries should use LoROM or HiROM so as to avoid the problem that someone is having.

You can see it in SHVC-1A0N boards.<br /><br />$c0:0000-7fff mirrors $c0:8000-ffff (ROM 0000-7fff)<br />$c1:0000-7fff mirrors $c1:8000-ffff (ROM 8000-ffff)<br /><br />&gt; As I understand it, just having read about it and not tried it, a HiROM game can use the 2-byte addresses to write to MMIO ports (PPU at $21xx and CPU at $43xx) as long as the code is running in the second half of a 64 KiB bank.<br /><br />Again, it's not that simple. What you call LoROM can be mapped in 40-7f and c0-ff. And what you call HiROM -is- mapped in 00-3f and 80-bf. It has to be for the game to boot at all (reset vectors are forced to be at $00:ffc0-ffff)

So did &quot;mapper 4&quot;. Yet <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/viewtopic.php?t=4412" class="postlink">Virtual Console uses the pirates' format</a>.<br /><br />That said, are there clearer terms than &quot;32K banks&quot; and &quot;64K banks&quot;? Or any reason to prefer the use of one or the other for contributions to a multicart? It's not as simple as it is on the NES, where a typical homebrew game is expected to fit in a single 32K bank.
