A rom might be a work in progress, a very obscure demo, custom patch, etc.<br /><br />However, the goal is to identify IF it is a NES rom but not necessarily what game it is.<br /><br />I was thinking that maybe there is some tiny piece of data that is in every NES ROM that I could check against.<br /><br />Any ideas are welcome!  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />

I was under the impression that GameCube games should use a different extension because they use a different file system. I've seen .gcm in use.<br /><br />The problem is similar to distinguishing a program written in Python 2 from a program written in Python 3. The &quot;open&quot; action under Windows looks only at the file name suffix, and it took Python Software Foundation years to get a proper handler for .py files under Windows that distinguishes Python 2 from Python 3 by the #! line.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I wrote a program that needed to distinguish different kinds of ROMs. I didn't deal with any disk based systems, so I can't help you there. For most ROMs, I just looked for some kind of magic number or standard string. You could go further and start verifying header data, but in my case this didn't seem necessary.<br /><br />For SNES, there isn't any magic number or standard string that I was aware of. (SMC headers have become much less popular, and if added back on, they may consist of all zeros instead of the correct SMC values.) Instead I verified the internal checksum if the ROM wasn't exceedingly large.<br /><br />In cases where more than one possible system was identified (or zero), I would disambiguate by file extension. If that failed, I simply asked the user to manually specify the system. But my program only worked on one ROM at a time. If it saves you any trouble, <a href="http://www.romhacking.net/utilities/1002/" class="postlink">the utility is here</a>, as well as a link to the source, and includes an HTML file that details platform detection.

So let's say, Mario rom can be called (in file system)<br />mario.nes<br />mario.rom<br />mario<br />(or if someone is particularly crazy)<br />mario.bin.doc.xls<br /><br />So detecting by header structure (should look like iNES header) rather than file extension has certain benefits as you can see unless you are ABSOLUTELY sure you'll NEVER port it on unix-like system.
