Two sets of system restore disks later (originally: 7 professional 64-bit. first: 7 pro 32-bit. second: 7 ultimate 64-bit) she finally got a functioning windows install again.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">blargg wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">Same for defragmenters; stay away from my disk!</div> I kinda like xfs_fsr for that reason.

It downloaded about 38 Windows Updates soon afterwards.</div><br /><br />Norton Ghost does a very good job of re-sizing during a clone operation of NTFS images without pre-re-sizing the image before-hand, in my experience, if that could help in the future.
