		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />yea i am bringing up a dead topic from the grave.
<br />
<br />I just completed the circuit mod and have had issue with it staying on.  The system will work for a while but then will just cut off (video and audio). I have made sure there is no grounding out, so I guess its the circuit. Now I have followed the in the instruction outlined in the program above, with one minor difference. Where it says to use a 560 pf 6.3 cap, i used a 561 pf cap. do you think this is causing my problem?
<br />
<br />
<br />thanks for any help.

<br />
<br />I already have all the components (which means I don't need to take any from the NES itself), but the instructions say that PPU pin 21 has to be lifted, which would kill the existing video circuit. Does anyone know how to do this?

Even the AV Famicom has one and that doesn't have a RF output. Once I put it back on, it has run great for 15 hours in a stress test.  Just got to check on it when I get home from work.
<br />
<br />I originally took it off because I needed room for the AV jacks. Now I can make a minor cut out to it to allow it to fit together correctly.
<br />
<br />Just wanted to post this in case it might help somebody.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Hello, just wanted to revive this thread again to say thanks to darthcloud for the schematic and dmtgamepack for the walk through guide. I've been reading through the forum and this thread in particular. I recently completed the mod on my nes2 after harvesting the Q1,FC2, and av jacks from a junk nes1. I placed the jacks and circuit board where the RF box used to be for aesthetics and convenience. I read after the fact that having the circuit close to the power supply could be problematic but I've been using the new mod and everything works great and I don't see any lines or other problems.
<br />
<br />The following link contains some pictures of the mod, thanks again.

<br />
<br />Made a small transistor based buffer and I'm getting video that's comparable with what my front loader does.
<br />The video output signal seems to be quite sensitive to noise, final tidied up version should yeld slightly better result <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />
<br />I also removed all the LPF caps

<br />Could you provide detailed instructions and an schematic? Your mod looks simple and efficient.

<br />
<br />Cut off PPU video signal output from the rest of the NES and feed it into the input of the buffer. Output signal can be fed to any TV and should work nicely. I used 56ohm resistor on the output to get the brightness down.

<br />There's nothing stopping you from routing the output of this mod back to the input of the r/f modulator, I think a few ppl here did try it, but you'll have to read this whole thread to find them. You may not be alone though so give it a try and post your results!
<br />I think you may just need to avoid feeding the signal back in anywhere except right at the r/f modulator input pin and possibly cut the trace leading to it, even then I wouldn't gurantee a bars free picture.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I was thinking there might still be some improvement possible on the quality of the video output of the NES and NES2, but never gave it much attention until I ran accross an amp circuit found in the datasheet of opa350. 
<br />I still have not gotten perfect color out of it IMO compared to the darthcloud/toaster amp. One of my biggest concerns is C5 should read pF instead of uF, but its only a guess, since its 1000 units. Also concerned I used electrolytics when I should have used ceramics, but 1000uF ceramic doesn't seem to exist or is to expensive to put in place, same with C1 at 220uF. Even with electro's I had to take Rg from 1K down to around 120 to get a decent image. Also Rout and Rload don't have values, but all they did was darken my image more.
<br />I tried to convert the circuit diagram from pdf to a jpg image, but i'm not good at it and its hard to read so I won't post it.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />From my buffer setup the signal will probably have to be attenuated slightly more for the RF modulator to like it. I cannot test it anymore since the modulator is no longer in working condition.
<br />
<br />EDIT:
<br />
<br />More or less cleaned up version... only thing left is routing video out nicely on the back of the system. The buffered signal won't pick up any meaningful noise, its rather low impedance.
