I dunno).<br /><br />All the levels are procedurally generated and based of set seeds so there's good scope for this to be accomplished inside a 32kb nROM cartridge I reckon. So far the games code is at 4kb and the basics are almost all in place.<br /><br />I'm hoping to set aside around 8kb for music and sound effect data, is that enough for a few minutes of music in general?

It is heavily dependent on what driver you're using, and how you compose your songs.

This means you can fit a lot of music into 8K.<br /><br />OP: How many tracks were you thinking? And were you thinking <em>Balloon Fight</em> or <em>Silver Surfer</em> complexity?

I should probably make sure to update more often next year!<br /><br />GBDK is what has led me down towards ASM, sooo, yeah, let's see how it goes.<br /><br />Regarding the random generator, I'm just taking a value, multiplying by 13, adding 1 then sotring that as the next rand.<br /><br />But I'm only updating that random generator when I need to. So, it's not per frame or anything, has a pattern of sorts, yet seems to be pretty random for the genreated levels at least so far. There's some obvious elements inside each level but I'll be making each world with a different stlye of generation, all using the same PRNG though.
