I only continued the discussion because someone <em>explicitly</em> talked to me and argued against my statements. So, why am <em>I</em> to blame? Am I not allowed to defend myself? The guy who quoted me made sure that the discussion goes on. If he hadn't referred to my statements, I wouldn't have written anything anymore.<br /><br />You cannot have both:<br /><br />Either you don't like my opinion and want to argue with me because you want to tell me I'm wrong.<br />But in this case don't complain that I argue back. In this case, you <em>wanted</em> the argument.<br /><br />Or you don't like the unpleasantness of my person or my arguments, independent from the <em>actual</em> fact-wise opinions that I state.<br />In this case, you might have noticed that I don't continue my arguments without external input. So, you just don't need to do anything and you won't hear of me again.<br /><br />But no, many people want to do both: They want to silence the discussion because it gets unpleasant. But before they do, they still want to have the last word, one last satisfaction, by telling me off and by writing a detailed answer why my arguments are invalid:<br /><br />&quot;Your opinion is nitpicky. The different graphic styles are no problem because A and B. Your arguments are nonsense. And now don't answer anymore, it gets unpleasant.&quot;<br /><br /><em>It doesn't work that way.</em><br /><br />And if you answer this post, there's no-one to blame but yourself that the discussion goes on. I don't have a problem with that. But you, who don't want to discuss, can end it any time by not responding. It's your decision. If you still feel the need to tell me what an asshole I am, despite my offer not to write anything anymore if nobody responds to my statements, well, then you're just as argumentative as me.

I just wanted to voice my concerns.</div><br />That was August the 2nd.<br /><br />Seven(!) days later, tomaitheous wrote a post <em>specifically</em> directed towards me.<br />The topic was over, yet he still had to pull it up again. It wasn't just some generic post about the topic. He talked to me directly and in a condescending way:<br /><div class="quotetitle">tomaitheous wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">DRW: &quot;And?&quot; meaning it's a non starter for an issue. <strong>It's just an issue with you.</strong> This is the NES. This type of stuff is the norm, <strong>if you haven't noticed</strong>. I'm willing to bet <strong>your <em>pet peeve</em></strong> is in the vast minority. Style/substance.. it's all subjective. I see no problem with it. Fits the era of the console. Moving on..</div><br />He did this despite me not being the only one complaining about the style and despite me not even starting the topic. And despite me not writing anything anymore, after my final review. And this was seven days ago.<br /><br />I would have never bothered to write anything about this anymore if it wasn't for his post that, I repeat, <em>was directed specifically towards me</em>.<br /><br />So, he wrote to me directly. Should I just have ignored him?<br /><br />But despite that, guess what: I didn't even fucking mention any of his arguments. Yeah. Did you notice it? I didn't say anything about the sprite style of &quot;Lala the Magical&quot;. I bet this went totally over your head, right? I never talked about the sprite discrepancy in this game.<br /><br />All I did was asking:<br /><div class="quotetitle">DRW wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"><div class="quotetitle">tomaitheous wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">This type of stuff is the norm, if you haven't noticed.</div><br />Alright, please name me a few NES games that have this kind of discrepancy.</div><br /><br />Nothing more. He said it's the norm with NES games, which I don't think is the case. And I asked for some examples.<br /><br />And then you came with:<div class="quotetitle">Light-Dark wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">Man its just an NES game made for fun for a competition.</div>talking to me as if I had just thrown a tantrum, even though I just asked for examples of games where a fanservice girl is shown in a completely non-fanservice, non-feminine way as the sprite.<br /><br />So, I still haven't said anything else about the sprite style of that game, but you felt the need to call me out on it, <em>man</em>.<br /><br />I didn't do anything but react to posts that were directed towards me. And guess what: All posts that came after my statement<div class="quotetitle">DRW wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">In the end, it's your decision after all, though. I just wanted to voice my concerns.</div>didn't even <em>argue</em> about the graphics style anymore. I didn't write a single statement about this game's sprite anymore. All the recent post were just general talk that had nothing to do with &quot;Lala the Magical&quot;.<br /><br />And yet, somehow I'm the asshole who is &quot;endless fighting over this small detail&quot;, despite me not mentioning &quot;this small detail&quot; at all in the past week and despite me only writing again after being directly spoken to by someone else.<br /><br />Where do you see me mentioning <em>anything</em> about this game's sprite in the posts after my final review?<br /><br />Again: Are you fucking kidding me? Did you even <em>read</em> what I wrote?<br />Do you even understand that I would have never written any further argument in this thread (and that I didn't start any other argument about the sprites in &quot;Lala the Magical&quot;)?<br />Do you get that I only wrote one thing: An answer to a post that was directed <em>specifically towards me</em>, including nothing but a general question about commercial games from the 80s and 90s?<br /><br />Am I not allowed to do this anymore? Am I not allowed to answer stuff that people tell me?<br /><br />Dammit, you guys cannot be pleased with anything, can you?<br />I write a factual review and I'm called rude.<br />I write, well, nothing in particular, just a general question, and two to three people jump in to write posts that contain nothing but the statement that I'm the guy who just cannot stop fighting.<br />Do you actually realize the irony in this?<br /><br />P.S.: <em>This one</em> is a rude post with a lot of fighting, not the other ones where I just analyzed some graphics stuff. Learn the difference.<br /><br />Alright, I'm out of here. That's my last post in this thread. Otherwise, when the next two or three people come and write what a rude asshole I am and I answered them, I would be the one who cannot stop fighting anyway, so I'll just leave it at that.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Sorry for the absence, but I'm on hollidays.<br /><br />Thanks for the kind comments. I think a bit of discussion is healthy. While I don't share DRW's concerns, his critiques have made me redraw the spriteset and I think the new one is better, so I'm quite thankful.<br /><br />Personally, I don't care that the character looks different, but I understand people who do.<br /><br />There's an explanation, anyways: I created the character quite a long time ago in comics. When I started coding videogames for retro systems, I designed a 16x16 sprite in 2 colours plus transparent for the character for a ZX Spectrum game. Monochrome and 16x16, and fit to be displayed using RF in cheap TVs, I had to go VERY schematic.<br /><br />When designing this game for the NES, I created the sprite as a coloured version of the original. Being so used to the original one, It didn't feel &quot;unnatural&quot; that the sprite and the full fledged character design didn't match.<br /><br />Anyways, I hope you enjoy the game when it's finished.<br /><br />Thanks everybody again for the comments, critiques, and general concern <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I'm curious what is the &quot;swing wand&quot; action for? Isn't the platform the only useful thing the wand does? How come the platform was hidden away in a button combination instead of just on B?<br /><br />I was really confused by how the platform ability worked until I went back and read the instructions. (You don't have the wand for so long, I'd forgotten the instructions by that point.) Naively attempting to use it via the B button, it felt like it was unreliable. I couldn't understand why it worked sometimes and sometimes not.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Swinging the wand is useful in the last level. You need to do it a lot to scare ghosts away so you have the time to move and time your platform creation. <br /><br />To create platforms you can use B+A or B+DOWN. I find it easier to use B+A as I'm usually jumping and pressing A. Some prefer DOWN+B. I couldn't be decided so I added both.<br /><br />It is mentioned in the cutscene, I seem to remember, but I may be wrong.
