What can I do to minimize the time applying the iron to the board (i.e. the best ways to prevent having to fix mistakes)?

Also for stuff that you should be real careful to do is not mix up ground and voltage that will kill the chip but don't expect flames just a bad smell in your room. Also for your flash chip there is no A18 that is Not connected. Also don't connect two wires to the same pin.

I just saw something in the makefile that can be invoked with<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">make writeflash</div>.<br /><br />Is it okay to hit 'reset' on the arduino while a chip is not being written, but is connected? The LED flash would blink the WE# line a few times.<br />Would I have to change the makefile for an atmega16u2 (Arduino Uno R3)?<br />*EDIT*<br />That was stupid. There are two Atmel Chips on the arduino, ATmega16u2 for USB I/O, and ATmega328p for everything else. Sorry!

I had to run make as root because I'm too lazy to set up valid permissions to access /dev/ttyACM0 as a non-root user, but it seemed to work!

Is serial strobe 'SER' on <a href="http://www.ti.com/lit/ds/symlink/sn74hc595.pdf" class="postlink">this datasheet?</a><br />On the same datasheet, is 'RCLK' the storage clock? And is SRCLK what the 'LSB' and 'MSB' lines go to? (I know that LSB is 'least significant bit' and MSB 'most significant', and these are like the endian-ness, is that correct?)<br />Does pin 12 (OE#) go to OE on the shift register, the sst39sf020, or both?<br />I'm pretty sure that is correct, but I really am a software guy. I just love hardware, but I'm too tentative to fry anything.
