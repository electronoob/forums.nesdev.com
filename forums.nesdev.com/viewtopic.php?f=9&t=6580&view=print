		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I'm looking for a clone system to play my 8bit famicom games on. I have an adapter and usually play them in toaster nes but am thinking of picking up a FC3 because they play snes, nes, and genesis.
<br />
<br />Question is does anyone know if this system will accept the adapter so i can play famicom carts in it, or any known problems with game compatibility? 
<br />
<br />If not then any recommendations on a good famiclone system?
<br />
<br />thanks

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I own real Nes hardware the old style original nintendo with the flip up door in front and also have a few famiclones. I own a retro-duo , with an nes adapter i made for original nes controller and also have a yobo nes, a portable mini x i beleive its called and to me when playing games i dont worry to much about the sound, or exact color rendering as long as there is no slow down all these details really go out the window when your in the game. The real hardware of course is always best for compatability reasons but a famiclone can also be fun. One downside to famiclones are
<br />that i have not been able to use powerpak on any of them yet. But again for a cheap new top loader i would recommend the yobo for nes and retro-duo for snes. I notice distortion in sound with the retro-duo with super mario 3 but not as much with the yobo system its seems smooth enough and emulation is good enough for a few hours of retro gaming.

I have a Turbo Game myself (<a href="http://img137.imageshack.us/img137/4537/cimg2224.jpg" class="postlink">picture</a> - as you can see, it's not NOAC-based and it has both types of cartridge slots), but I haven't tested my PowerPak on it because I can't get any controllers to work, so I'd be stuck in the menu and I don't see the point.
<br />
<br />This console hasn't been manufactured for years, but it's still fairly easy to buy them used. I usually shop for this stuff at <a href="http://lista.mercadolivre.com.br/turbo-game" class="postlink">Mercado Livre</a>, a site that works kinda like eBay. I don't know if the people who sell there are used to shipping internationally though.
<br />
<br />But why don't you just get a real NES? I'm sure it would be cheaper...
