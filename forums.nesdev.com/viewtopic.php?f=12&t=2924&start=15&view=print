<br />None of both <img src="./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /> It is an MSDos program that loads a lot of files (some containing text, others graphics and a few tables and such), encodes it all and inserts it into a fresh new copy of the original ROM. It is somehow like an "importer".

<br />Anyways, I wanted to figure out how to change the title screen of SD3:

<br />I'm a total noob at this, really the only thing I know my way around is Photoshop... if I could find Magno's tool maybe it would be easier for me to figure out. Everything else has just confused me..

<br />That tool doesn't work as you nay think: it is a executable that reads some configuration files, ASM hacks, graphic and text in each bank to compress all together into the ROM file. You can't choose what to update (like the intro screen) but you have to configure some parameters in order to make it work properly.

<br />Is there any way to fix the patch so this does not happen? I want to be able to apply the new screen to the 1.01 english translation without any of these issues. A person by the name of Dragonsbrethren once made a similar patch a long time ago simply by isolating the screen from an older german rom and converting that into an IPS that affected -only- the title screen. If he can be contacted, maybe he can figure out how to separate Jezz and Red's title screen and piece it into a patch that can safely be applied to the English 1.01 rom.

<br />
<br />Sorry, but I can't understand a word about all this... is that bug in the patch created with my tool?? Nobody has ever complained about such a bug (the tool is currently being used to translate it into italian, french, swedish, russian...)
<br />If the title screen has been inserted using the tool, then please send me an email with all the files you used. If not, maybe some offset is wrong, as my tool moves data blocks between different locations to make room for the compressed data.

<br />The short version is that Red used your tool to implant a new title screen that Jezz made for the game in Photoshop. He managed to implant this title into the German rom without this fairies glitch: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKMgFLtfxKs&amp;feature=player_embedded">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKMgFLtf ... r_embedded</a><!-- m --> - However, when he sent me the ips to apply to the English version rom, the fairies in the intro glitched. All I want is to be able to insert this new beautiful title logo into the English rom without the glitch.
<br />
<br />I remember that Dragonsbrethren had made a similar patch in the past, and that his patch copied an older title screen from an older german rom. I had applied that patch to the English rom and never had any problems. Maybe Dragonsbrethren can make a new title screen patch using the redesigned logo from Red and Jezz.

Dragonsbrethren responded and it appears that he does not remember much from when he made that patch, but he shares your theory that maybe something went wrong with the offsets or the image is too big in Red and Jezz's logo so it is pushing graphics out of the way and causing the fairies glitch when the patch is applied to the English rom.

<br />Ok, now I fully understand <img src="./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /> But what you want to do, can't be done <img src="./images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" alt=":(" title="Sad" />
<br />
<br />My patch and Neill's one aren't compatible at all, so any patch made with my tool can't be added to the English version because a lot of data blocks are moved in my version to make room for text. As I said, the offsets aren't equal, so that glitch appears...
