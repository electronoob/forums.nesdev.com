		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Doing a computed goto is (slightly) faster than using a switch, because you do it at the end of an opcode instead of looping back around. One jump instead of two.<br /><br />Of course, Java doesn't have any faculties for doing a computed goto (AFAIK). And unconditional branches are all but free on a modern CPU anyway. On CPUs that execute at two billion cycles a second, a million extra unconditional jumps per second really, really doesn't matter.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />It's actually working really well like I said. I'm kinda casting a wide net for improving the performance further. The actual issue I'm experiencing I think has to do with power save features on android devices, because it just mysteriously throttles down to like 1/4 speed even though my thread is doing the exact same work every time.<br /><br />I don't even have a PPU  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_lol.gif" alt=":lol:" title="Laughing" />   not really, anyway. It just renders the tiles, straight, rather than scanline per scanline. I.e. not a real NES emulator, see <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/viewtopic.php?f=3&amp;t=15373" class="postlink">GGVm thread</a> if curious.

The best comparison I guess would be PocketNES for Game Boy Advance, which also has a HLE PPU because it maps the NES's tiled backgrounds and sprites onto those of the GBA. Yet it somehow runs at full speed on a 16.8 MHz ARM7TDMI.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I have another question relevant to what I'm working on: I know that the CPU clock speed from the wiki is: 1.789773 mhz, which amounts to about 29829.55 cycles per 1/60th of a second, correct? How many actual instructions per frame does that amount to, on average? I am going to guess the average amount of cycles taken by any given instruction is about 3 (seeing some as low as 2 and some as high as 7)?<br /><br />Right now, one of the metrics my cpu spits out is &quot;instructions per second.&quot; I have no concept of ticks or cycles, it is a purely high level cpu simulator. Thus when I'm seeing a metric such as: 2,570,423 instructions per second, this is ridiculously faster than the NES needs to be, if I'm correct in the above paragraph at all.<br /><br />One thing I learned today is Android throttles down CPUs when they get hot. I do seem to observe a degradation of performance over time, and if I let it sit and start over the speed is restored.<br /><br />Perhaps all I need to do is manually throttle the cpu with Thread.nanosleep, at least on mobile devices in an attempt to stress the cpu less? After all, there's absolutely no reason to be &quot;overclocking&quot; to the extreme degree that it is right now.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />...hmm...from what I'm reading, sleep will still use the cpu. Sounds like I want wait. Problem is I can't know when I should do that. Since GGVm already has game-specific knowledge perhaps I can tell it where all nmi wait spin loops are and do wait/notify to give the thread some rest between frames.

Now I just need to figure out how to measure instructions per second correctly taking into account when the thread is sleeping, so I can observe whether this really does get me an improvement or not.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Welp, as a quick update, it turns out my 6502 core wasn't the bottleneck after all, it was how I was using opengl. One game was running around 23fps on a 3 year old phone of mine---changed some things in how I'm using opengl and now its 60fps. Crazy stuff...<br /><br />That said...I actually found a simpler way to use wait/notify on my cpu thread. I just count the instructions and when it reaches 10,000 (a rough estimate based on roughly 30,000 cycles per frame) it blocks, and then I notify on every nmi.
