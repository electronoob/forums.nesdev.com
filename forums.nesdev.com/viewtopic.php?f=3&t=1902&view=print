		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />if mmc1 is reset at the beginning of the game (no previous write to the program register) , what bank is used for program space 8000 ?  is it random ?
<br />
<br />is there any delay when a new page takes effect ?  is immediate ? or a cycle delay?
<br />
<br />also when mmc1 is reset, the high program bank is fixed to the last memory bank, corrent ?
<br />
<br />still trying to figure out mmc1, doesnt look that hard.  right now i have alot of graphic glitches all over.  doube dragon, metroid, and zelda(depending if i fix the last bank on reset) will show the first 2 screens, but when i hit start for the first level, the game resets... like a power on.
<br />
<br />rc pro am seems to work, but messed up graphics soon as i start to race, playable if i guess the track from the other cars.
<br />
<br />no problems with tetris.
<br />
<br />ill keep working at it.  maybe i might post the code after i clean it up a bit.
<br />
<br />are there any suggestions with mmc1 ?
<br />
<br />also,  i have save/battery ram 6000 - 8000 always enabled
<br />
<br />thanks
<br />
<br />matt

MMC1 is actually somewhat special in that certain bits of the first internal register are always set on powerup (so when you turn power on, it will always be in 16k swap @ $8000 mode).<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">is there any delay when a new page takes effect ?  is immediate ? or a cycle delay?</div><br /><br />Immediate.  No actual "swapping" is really taking place.. all that's happening is the mapper is using its internal register to replace the high bits of PRG reads.  The term "swap", while descriptive, is somewhat misleading.<br /><br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">also when mmc1 is reset, the high program bank is fixed to the last memory bank, corrent ?</div><br /><br />When set to 16k swap mode (which happens on reset), yes -- the unswappable bank (on reset, this would be $C000) is set to it's fixed page.<br /><br />However note that the "last bank" in this case is really "the last bank in the current 256k block".  When you start dealing with SUROM (512k PRG -- DQ4, etc), the $C000 <strong>does</strong> flip between page $0F and $1F even though it's so-called "hardwired".<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">rc pro am seems to work, but messed up graphics soon as i start to race, playable if i guess the track from the other cars.</div><br /><br />RC Pro AM is Mapper 7 though (AOROM?) -- not MMC1  ;P<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">are there any suggestions with mmc1 ?</div>
<br />
<br />Not for MMC1 specifically -- but with pretty much ANY mapper with exceptions (this ties in with the above, where I was saying that the term "swap" is misleading):
<br />
<br />Remember that no actual swap is being performed -- so instead of swapping only when the PRG page is changed, keep track of the internal MMC1 registers -- so that when the mode is changed you can apply the existing register contents in their new behavior.
<br />
<br />Example, it's perfectly legal and acceptable for a game to switch to 8k CHR mode, select two 4k CHR pages, then switch BACK to 4k CHR mode.  Once it changes back to 4k mode, the 4k page selections should be in effect... if you're only doing the "swap" when it changes the pages, you're in for trouble, since you'll have the wrong pages swapped in after that.
<br />
<br />To show this in a bit more detail:
<br />
<br />(assume 'Fill' routines perform the desired 5 register writes)
<br />
<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">; clear all regs to 0<br />LDA #$00<br />JSR Fill_8000<br />JSR Fill_A000<br />JSR Fill_C000<br />JSR Fill_E000<br /><br />; even though we're now in 8k CHR mode...<br />;&nbsp; &nbsp;specify a 4k CHR page at ppu$1000<br />LDA #$07<br />JSR Fill_C000<br /><br />; and put an odd page at ppu$0000<br />LDA #$01<br />JSR Fill_A000<br /><br /><br />;<br />;&nbsp; Here, since we're in 8k mode, ppu$0000 contains<br />;&nbsp; 8k CHR page at $00 &#40;low bit of $A000 reg ignored&#41;<br />;<br />;&nbsp; HOWEVER!&nbsp; $A000 reg STILL contains $01<br />;&nbsp; and $C000 reg STILL contains $07!<br />;<br />;&nbsp; so now if we switch to 4k mode...<br /><br />LDA #$10<br />JSR Fill_8000<br /><br />; now ppu$0000 contains 4k CHR page $01<br />; and ppu$1000 contains 4k CHR page $07!<br /></div>
<br />
<br />Hopefully that makes some sense.
<br />
<br />Swapping makes a whole lot more sense when you don't think of it as swapping.
<br />
<br />
<br />edits -- some corrections -- mixed up regs before

<br />
<br />On an MMC1A it's definitely not, it was semi-random (mostly was a certain bank, don't know which one, but not the last one).  Just nitpicking though, MMC1 revisions shouldn't matter in an emulator, but could frustrate a developer on the real hardware who tests with emus.

<br />
<br />It depends which version you're playing - PRG0 is AOROM, but PRG1 is SEROM (MMC1).

<br />Doh!
<br />
<br />Didn't know earlier revisions didn't set themselves up properly.  Whoopsie.

<br />This is true of MMC1, but there exists at least one other mapper that has a few cycles of latency between when the CPU writes to the bank switch register and when the change in high order address bits takes effect.
