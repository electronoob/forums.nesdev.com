<br />Oh, snap! I had forgotten about that.
<br />With the expansion port adapter wouldn't it be as simple as connecting EXP0-EXP1 with Audio In/Out on the adapter, and use the EXP0-EXP1 in the cartridge as the Audio In/Out on the Famicom?

<br />
<br />NB : The MMC5 should be the best emulated expansion sound, because it's just two more square wave channels which are identical to the ones inside the NES except the lack the sweep function. (or are you using that weird/undocumented additional DMC channel ?)
<br />
<br />I'd fear that other types of expansion sound (FDS, VRC6, N106) would be emulated inaccurately - because it's hard to make a card using them on 100% real hardware. For VRC6 you'll have to import one game from japan, for the FDS not only you have to import one, but you'll have to do crazy modifications to it to be able to rewrite disks, and for the N106 all cads are epoxy blobs so impossible to change the ROMs on them.
<br />
<br />I believe the VRC7 and FME7 are variants of well known standard sound chips, so they should be decently emulated.

<br />No, I only use the standard square channels, which is why I was surprised so many emulators didn't emulate them. I suppose it had lower priority due to the NES doesn't support the extra sound from the cartridge?

The majority of emulator users' priority on MMC5 is just to see CV3 working, even though CV3 uses very few of the MMC3's advanced features.

<br />Bregalad, you do know it's common practice to cut a square around the glop-tops and use their traces to connect to them, right?
<br />
<br /><a href="http://i499.photobucket.com/albums/rr351/Life-of-Brian/DSC01866.jpg" class="postlink">Example 1</a>
<br /><a href="http://forums.benheck.com/viewtopic.php?f=2&amp;t=16281" class="postlink">Example 2</a>
<br /><a href="http://www.benheck.com/Games/Sega_projects/Exodus/ExodusController.jpg" class="postlink">Example 3</a>
<br />
<br />So even if changing the ROM on the board is impossible, it should still be possible to remove the mapper and put it in another board. It's not impossible.

<br />
<br />- Import a Namco game from japan using this mapper
<br />- Open this game and cut the epoxy blob containing the mapper
<br />- Find a host board that has a mapper that could be replaced by the N106 without too much modifications
<br />- Connect all wires to the host board
<br />
<br />Or alternatively :
<br />
<br />- Cut the epoxy blobs for both PRG-ROM and CHR-ROM on the game you imported, and somehow connect your own EPROMs/FLashROMs to them.

<br />
<br />BTW it's fun I already wondered if it would work to have code running entierely in the internal 2k of RAM, of course it would require to completely disable NMIs and IRQs, and hopefully the user don't press reset.

<br />That's doable. How big was the music code in SMB1? And how hard would it be to stream the music from a PC through controller port 2?
<br />
<br />But doing without NMI might screw you up because you can't reliably wait for vblank without hitting the 1/21 skip probability from spinning on $2002. If you can hook a game's NMI handler, on the other hand... What main loop style did Namco use most in N106 games? SMB1-style (all in NMI), FF1-style (all in main loop), or mixed?

<br />I do this all the time. Small loader sits in memory waiting to receive $500-byte program from PC, program is run, then loader is re-run waiting for next program.
<br />
<br />You could poll the 2A03's frame IRQ flag, since that can be reliably read. Or you can rely on the data stream from the PC to the NES for timing.
