		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />OK wow... just thought of some other possibilities.  With 32 frames of 2k of tiles being swapped, you can add many more tile animations, and they don't all have to be rotated by only 1 pixel per frame.  Some can be faster, some can be slower, and not every row or column has to be updated at the same rate.  <br /><br />Additionally you can have animated single metatiles like candles, etc, though they would best be mixed up in the foreground due to attribute limits.<br /><br />I imagine all sorts of effects  even before throwing in hblank screen splits on top of it.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />But the active 2KB frame <strong>IS</strong> dictated by the scroll position. In order to have other animations independent from the scroll you'd need to use another CHR slot. You could have the background use the pattern table that's divided into 1KB chunks instead, use 1 slot for parallax patterns (you could mix 32x32-pixel patterns with 16x16-pixel ones) and another slot for constant animations such as waterfalls, candles flickering, and so on. The disadvantage is that the sprite side side would be divided into 2KB chunks, which may or may not be a problem depending on how you are animating the main character.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Hi, I'd just like to say the demo looks good !<br />However it would look even better if, instead of using a darker palette on the same background tile for shadows, it would use a hand made darker version of the tile (using the same palette). Since you're using an entiere 2kb of tiles for the rotation, you'd want to put all this space to good use.<br />It could make the shadows less blocky and more progressive. Here it's very obvious the shadows are 16x16 blocks which looks a bit corny.

That's a lot of so called newbie friendliness down the drain when it introduces arbitrary requirements like this. (I, too, used NESASM when I first started and was baffled by &quot;.bank&quot;, especially because the tutorial I used didn't explain why it was like that, just said &quot;you have to do it like this&quot;.)

After the header, all 8K banks (with bank 0 first) is send to output.<br /><br />Remember: .ORG uses only the low 13 bits for the address within the bank; the rest of the address specified with .ORG is used only for computing the addresses of labels.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Just saw some of the things MMC5 does...  total hard on.  How is it able to take over so much of the PPU hardware like removing the attribute table limit and increasing the PPU addressable tile count from 256 to 16,384?<br /><br />Brings its own VRAM so I guess it can swap attribute bits on a per tile fetch basis watching the CHR ROM A/D lines and can swap tile banks mid frame.<br /><br />Nvm I get it.  You see the A/D lines for both the chr rom and nametable fetches you can do whatever you want within the granularity of one clock and one 8 bit data bus read.
