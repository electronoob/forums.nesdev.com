<br />The mappers aren't an issue, since the dumper has to be able to read and write the PRG space anyway. If we can get the hotswap technique working reliably, or figure out what prevents that (maybe the edge fingers need to connect GND/+5V first?), then a dumper can be very cheap, using the NES itself. An alternative to hotswapping is a small mod to the NES itself that allows booting to a "copynes mini" bootstrap ROM that allows control by a PC over a serial connection.

<br />After I posted my question I search Google Images for "nes game genie circuit board" and found this:

<br />
<br />Maybe some Game Genies use glob-tops, but some don't.
<br />
<br />I assume that the chip on the right is the char-rom and the chip on the left is the prog-rom + game genie frob.
<br />
<br />Unfortunately, (and this is just a guess), it looks like the prog-rom is built into the actual frob, making it really difficult to hack.

<br />I thought that Game Genies didn't have CHR chips, and just generated patterns based on the addresses used to access the CHR data (hence the "blocky" interface). I'm not 100% sure though.

<br />The one on the right has markings that indicate it's a ROM, with version 1.5 of the genie software.
<br />
<br />Game Genie is a nifty idea for this dumper. I might have to try making an EPROM programmer and trying this with mine. It'd be great for getting control while any cartridge is inserted, and as a bonus, you can patch the vectors to point into RAM. ... Excellent, it's a ROM, with the same pinout as a 2732 EPROM which I've got. So I just need to get a bootloader into an EPROM and solder/desolder it in.

<br />
<br />I bet the EPROM could also include the normal Game Genie ROM, so that if you're holding a button on the controller when you power up, it runs the normal Genie ROM so you still have a working Game Genie usable without connection to a PC.
<br />
<br />The main obstacles for me trying this is the lack of an EPROM programmer/eraser, and desoldering the Genie ROM. I'm quite sure it would all work.

AFAIK, nobody has written a hardware accurate 68000... With all the microcode it's a huge task and challenge, I'm not sure that stuff has even been reverse engineered... There's also a memory &amp; latency issue; Neo basically has 5x 200ns buses of different widths opposed to 2x 8-bit in the NES and it's hard to meet the timing requirements with a single SDRAM, regardless of how fast. Anyway, a real Neo Geo home console is &lt;$200 and an arcade board (MVS) is &lt;$100 and they aren't as rare as one might think.</div>
<br />I've started work on a NeoGeo. It's only very preliminary stuff, using the 68k core from Minimig and only has a limited number of text/tiles displayed. It boots past the self-test (had to implement the RTC) and Joy Joy Kid actually runs (on a DE1)!!! You can coin-up and start a game, but you really only get to see the text changing.
<br />
<br />I don't think a cycle-accurate 68K is as important for the NeoGeo as it is for the NES, for example. With a more straight-forward tilemap/sprite system and async CPU bus, I suspect there's a lot less reliance on CPU instruction timings in most of the NeoGeo games.
<br />
<br />You are correct re:problems on current FPGA boards. Obviously I never had any pretentions of getting the whole thing going on the DE1, for example. But I do (now) have access to more powerful boards, including one with a Stratix EP3SL70 AND a Cyclone EP4C16, some SRAM and DDR3 RAM, and DVI out. That will be interesting to play with. I just don't have time atm... <img src="./images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" alt=":(" title="Sad" />

<br />
<br />I too would absolutely *love* to do the SNES. I've been "pissing around" doing lots of little projects and porting other people's efforts to the various hardware targets I have, but not yet done a "complex" design. I also tend to get things 90% complete and move on to other projects.
<br />
<br />Right now I'm working on finishing up a Tandy Coco 1/2 design which I hope will be my first "complete" design. The idea was to collaborate with a few others but it has turned out to be pretty much 100% my work. It's mostly there, I just need to add SD card support for IDE emulation - something I think will come in handy for other projects in the future!
<br />
<br />Good luck, I have no doubt you or all people can do it!
