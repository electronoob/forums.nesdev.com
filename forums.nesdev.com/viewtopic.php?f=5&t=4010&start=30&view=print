<br />2. I'm from Central PA, and still live in Central PA
<br />3. I realized recently that new games suck, and old games kick ass. My NES still works perfectly, so I started playing it again, and then felt an overwhelming urge to make a game for it.
<br />4. I like to play the piano, read, play video games, and program.
<br />5. 25, two cats, married to the love of my life who can consistently kick my ass at Dr. Mario, and no kids (yet)
<br />6. How about gameboy related? One time I transcribed Music C from tetris to sheet music, then the next day I went to a library, got out a random book on music theory, flipped to a random page, and found Music C there. It is a menuet from the 3rd french suite in B minor, by bach.
<br />7. I'm a software developer.
<br />8. I have no idea what the future holds for me. Probably economic apocalypse and hunger. But supposing that doesn't happen, I sincerely hope to finish one, maybe three really good video games of my own within my lifetime.

<br />6: I used to bite and twist my NES controllers in fits of rage. Not having any money for new controllers, I learned how to solder 'jumper' wires on the cracked boards. My soldering station was my the top of the washing machine to mother's dismay. I still remember the day when the soldering iron rolled off the washing machine and landed on top of my bare thigh (80's OP short shorts ftw!). There was a whole 5 seconds of shock watching my skin boil/bubble... then the pain kicked in and the screaming began. That's funny, right?
<br />7: Currently in limbo
<br />8: It doesn't. I hold the future for myself.

<br />2. Born, raised, and currently reside in New Jersey
<br />3. NES is fantastic. I am more into collecting than the hardware/development aspect however. I wrote a few very SIMPLE programs in assembly language and it's not really for me. I know how to program but assembly is a completely different beast. I wish I was determined enough to learn... <img src="./images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" alt=":(" title="Sad" />
<br />4. Hang out with family and friends. Party. Chill.
<br />5. 21, no pets (RIP), single, no children
<br />6. I once made a functional bootable Helloworld NES rom image!
<br />7. No job currently. I'm a student studying computer science and business at a university called Rowan.
<br />8. Great great things <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />1. Who are you?
<br />There are some who call me............... John
<br />
<br />2. Where are you from/Where do you live?
<br />Born and raised in Memphis, TN. Lived in Birmingham, AL a couple of years. I ended up coming back to Memphis.
<br />
<br />3. Why are you into NES emulation?
<br />I also prefer real hardware. I like how easy it is to make really cool modifications to the NES hardware. Also the NES is a classic that will never die. Unfortunately I've never been great with Assembly. I was "taught" Motorola 6800 in college as I have an Associates degree in computer engineering, but it was never my strong language. I say "taught" because it was taught in a manner that assumed I already knew it, and I've never been able to learn that way. So, don't look forward to any games from me any time soon. I'm sure if I learn 6502 it will come to me slowly. I've always been much stronger in hardware. I'd love to find a connector that would fit the expansion slot!
<br />I also love my supernes. If I could find a Powerpak like cart for it I'd love that too!
<br />
<br />4. What do you do in your spare time?
<br />This is my spare time. So I guess I sit and stare blankly at the computer screen, or play with my NES. 
<br />
<br />5. Age. Pets. Marital Status. Children?
<br />30, 5 cats, a dog, and a Parakeet. I've been Married for 6 years, almost 7 and have no children yet.
<br />
<br />6. Any funny stories? (hopefully NES related)
<br />My 20 year old NES Max still works. I still use it. Not really funny just a story. I have 2 NES systems, The one I've had since 4th grade, and one I got in a garage sale. The only reason the one I've had since 4th grade has ever been opened was to install a new cartridge connector. The other one gets all the modifications. Extra audio mod, blue power LED, disabled lockout chip, hopefully eventually a copynes usb.

<br />
<br />
<br />7. Do you have a job/Are you a student? If so what?
<br />I do onsite service calls fixing computers. 
<br />
<br />8. What does the future hold for you?
<br />My wife is in nursing school. She should graduate in October and hopefully then we can buy a house and start our family.
