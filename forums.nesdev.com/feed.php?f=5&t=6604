BTW, if you guys want, we have Wordpress available and also have Drupal installed on the server. For database needs, if any, we have SQL Server 2005 as well as MySQL. But if you want to go the static HTML route, that's cool too... just let me know if you need anything.<br /><br />-Dain<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=4597">Dain</a> — Tue Jan 11, 2011 6:07 pm</p><hr />

I have a million idea for cool NES games, but chances are that few will ever see the light.<br /><br />In the end a new game will always be a modified "clone" of an existing game I guess. What counts is to do something else than plain copy things. For example Dr Mario could be considered a Tetris clone, but it's very different, you destroy blocks by matching them instead of by completing rows, and you win when all viruses are deleted, which makes it funnier to play than tetris (IMO). The music is also goddamn good, instead of copying Tcheakovsky's music, which makes it way better. Puyo Puyo is also an improvement of tetris, but it's different, it has this cute aspect the other puzzle games lacks, which makes it a huge improvement as well.<br /><br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"><br />Point of terminology: As I understand it, "Turbo" is the arcade and PS1 versions, which don't slow down with a lot of exploding, but the GBA version isn't "Turbo" because of all its slowdown.<br /></div><br />Huh ? The GBA version is turbo as well. The game is nommed like that just because it's based on Super Street Fighter Alpha Turbo 2. They just removed the "alpha" and repaced "street" by "puzzle".<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=38">Bregalad</a> — Mon Jan 10, 2011 2:53 pm</p><hr />

At first I thought that my clone was going to be fairly easy to do.  The neutral zone (implemented) and Qotile death animation (not done yet) were going to be a challenge.  The rest I assumed would be "easy".<br /><br />Well, the game is still conceptually simple.  The devil, as they say, is in the details.  Some parts of nesdev might seem simple to those of you who have completed finished games, but for me I learned a great deal, and still have far to go.<br /><br />This is my first serious NES project.  And for my first full game, I think that I choose fairly well.  The game mechanics are fairly simple.  I have a known quantity that I am comparing my results to (the original).  I'm not taking on a project that is too large for my experience level.<br /><br />In the future, I hope to have time to do something more ambitious.  I have a few ideas in mind, but I don't want to leak them right now - other than to say that they are original ideas and not clones of anything.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3664">clueless</a> — Mon Jan 10, 2011 2:21 pm</p><hr />
