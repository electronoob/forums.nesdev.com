Ah, I understand, now. You mean 4th installement because you say Illusion of Time and Terranigma to be Soul Blader's sequel (well, not sequel, but belong to the same series), right ?<br /><br />If you need a sound programmer, I mean do that if you wish.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=38">Bregalad</a> — Sun Dec 11, 2005 7:09 am</p><hr />

It's not a sequel to any game.  It's another installment to the series.  There are no items from any of the games besides what is apparent in all of them, like Dark and Light Gaia, forced to leave their home on a quest, Turbo the Dog...<img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" /><br /><br />It's about as different as each of those games were.  Plus, that's what my next project is gonna be like, just a game all on it's own <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /><p>Statistics: Posted by Guest — Sat Dec 10, 2005 2:07 pm</p><hr />

I always like the fact that people have such projects, but why make a sequel of an existing game ? Why not invent your own series ?<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=38">Bregalad</a> — Fri Dec 09, 2005 10:08 am</p><hr />

*REPOSTED FROM PANICUS*<br /><br />Hey, you all semi know me, so I won't bother with an introduction.<br /><br />You probably also know I'm a rookie with all the knowledge at hand for me but no practical experience in Rom Hacking.<br /><br />As a project to help me with that, I'm creating a 4th installment to the Soul Blazer series. To a literal point, that would seem to be jumping the gun. But hell, I've got all the time in the world to do this project and I already have somewhat of a team assembled.<br /><br />It's gonna be done in Assembly. I have 2, possibly even 3 spriters working together, plus a few people working on the storyline with me. We're not very far into it, but it's pretty damn early into development, really starting only a week or 2 ago.<br /><br />If you're interested, contact me via MSN or #rom-hacking if I'm there...I could really use some pointers in how to get started.<br /><br /><!-- e --><a href="mailto:rom_manic@hotmail.com">rom_manic@hotmail.com</a><!-- e --><br /><br />L8er!<br /><br />PS: Everyone on the team so far is accustomed to using RM2K/XP, but that would only affect the spriters. And they have been informed on how to keep the proper tile arrangements in place.<br /><br />PPS: Afterwards, I will probably convert Terranigma into NTSC as a side project. I know alot of people would be happy with that.<p>Statistics: Posted by Guest — Thu Dec 08, 2005 6:24 pm</p><hr />
