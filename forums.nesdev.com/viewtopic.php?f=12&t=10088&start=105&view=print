However, here's my two bits:<br />Super Metroid does have flashcart protection that I haven't learned to patch out yet. I'm not sure if that's related to the current issue or not. If you can find me information on its protection I'll get right on that, otherwise it'll be the next thing I do after attempting to fix the 8MByte issue.<br />I've never tried Dezaemon or Castlevania Dracula X, so I can't answer those at the moment. I'll pin that.<br />There's a known issue posted (in the new host app's thread) about uploading games larger than 8MByte, so even if it was properly deinterleaved it wouldn't work with my app at present. The issue is changes in casting of USB packets in the up-to-date libraries. I'm working on a fix.

So for others with the same or similar problem on 12MB Board, you might want to try this too.<br />Now there is only left the support for bigger files than 8MB and HiRom games <img src="./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" />.

I'm working on a comprehensive disassembly of several games to catch patterns in SRAM checking behavior, I assure you that if you have to ask how to get it to show, it's very likely beyond your scope of patching. We're talking assembly-level opcalls..there's also no SRAM 'file' and it's not as easy as just changing a number..<br /><br />Unless of course I'm completely misinterpreting your intention here.

Beyond that, a little Google-fu will probably clear it up. Perhaps get the RAM mappings from a game with larger RAM, and the rest from your target game? Hopefully that's a leg-up.

One applies &quot;slowrom fixes&quot; which no one should need now. Another applies region lockout &quot;fixes&quot;. Then the last is &quot;cracks&quot; which is option -k which deals with copy protections. I've not come across a single game that doesn't work.<br /><br />Emulators are very easy to fool into having the wrong amount of SRAM available as they read the imbedded rom info/header at $FFC0 for that. Just change it and you can easily trip the protection. But you could always just check the source code for ucon64.<br /><br />The problem with pattern searches though is if the pattern is too small you risk a false positive that might break a game. This chance is reduced if you aren't trying to patch every game, but instead only when you have problems. The better idea would be to check the game title string located at the imbedded info block and then searching for the pattern.<br /><br />Infact you could just have a table of all the games that may need cracks and when a game is chosen to write you could prompt the user if the game detected has any patches available for region or protection cracking, asking them if they wish to use them. <br /><br />There is not a huge number of games that need these cracks. This is from a list I have.<br /><br />Breath of Fire II<br />Demon's Crest* <br />Donkey Kong Country 1,2,3*<br />Earthbound*<br />Front Mission - Gun Hazard (J) - Has a note about translated version I believe.<br />Killer Instinct*<br />Kirby's Dream Course <br />Lufia II - Rise of the Sinistrals <br />Mario no Super Picross <br />Mega Man X* <br />Super Mario All-Stars* <br />Super Mario All-Stars &amp; World <br />Super Metroid* <br />Tetris Attack <br />Uniracers <br /><br /><br />Ofcourse this list is just some old list I found which may have some inaccuracies and may be incomplete. Those with * I know have protection for sure.

If you enjoy it, and enjoy learning how it all works, more power to you. The entire host app was basically &quot;I'm bored, I want to improve this, let's do some learning.&quot; so I really can relate. If there's anything else I can help with, I'll be more than happy to do so. There's actually a build of SNES9X that has a builtin debugger too, if you're interested I'm sure I could find a URL someplace, but I think from here maybe PM would be better than flooding this thread. Drop me a line and I'll try to chase it down.

This patch if for a Headered (JU) rom and completely bypasses the check routine which runs literally thousands of times with various checks in between the routine to either erase the saves or show the piracy screen and also erase the saves. If this proves successful then if there are games with such protections that have no fix in Ucon64 then I can take a look for anyone who needs it.<br /><br />GG code:<br />6D69-17AF<br />DF61-1DDF<br /><br />IPS Patch with Checksum Fixed:
