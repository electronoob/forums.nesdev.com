Controllers are not part of an NES cartridge; there's no NES counterpart to Codemasters' <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J-Cart" class="postlink">J-Cart</a> for the Genesis. This means metadata describing the preferred controller for a given game shouldn't strictly be part of the ROM image. But there should still be a cross-emulator way to specify the required and preferred controllers in a separate file so that the emulator can quickly switch the mouse or touch screen input among Zapper, Vaus, Oeka Kids Tablet, and Super NES Mouse modes. Hopefully it'd be in some sort of human-editable text format. XML? JSON? INI variant? Any schema ideas?

What is so great about those that I'm apparently missing?</div><br /><br />Extensibility, Metadata. There are problems with human readable formats, but all the problems it has also exist in binary formats. I personally don't like memorizing which arbitrary mapper number corresponds to which board/mapper chip. Some boards don't have names and require a number, so I think some sort of mixed format would be optimal. Perhaps an extension to iNES that adds a block of XML metadata to the end of the file. This ensures that the new format is backwards compatible and allows for metadata in emulators that support it. Also if the XML metadata doesn't have the board name, you could fall back to the iNES mapper number. But since all revisions to iNES, and all new NES file formats are instantly met with a distilled hatred, it won't happen.<br /><br />EDIT: Also solves the problem for homebrew developers not having XML data in the internal database of whatever emulator. It decentralizes the metadata storage from emulators to game files. And any emu devs that detest the idea of having extra information about a game don't have to support it (Since it's at the end of the file, you don't even have to skip passed it). It's a perfect solution that no one should have a problem with.

Existing emulators can run the ZIP directly and not even know the markup is there, and extract+play still works. You'll still get complaints from everyone that nobody will ever adopt your format, and that you're wasting your time, and that it can never be relied on to be there, and so forth. Others will insist you should use .7z, or .jma, or .unif, or some new container format, or some other compression container.<br /><br />Finally, this format will be mired with years of debate. First, about which markup language to use. XML? JSON? YAML? INI? I went with BML: parses with ~3KB of code, no entities/escaping, no billion laughs attacks. Once you finally have consensus on the format, you'll argue about what each field should be named, whether we should use camelCase, under_scores or CapsCase, who should be allowed to define new information for the spec (which will result in incompatible forks of the format), etc.<br /><br />Have fun =)<br /><br />(FWIW, I do like this idea. I say whoever wants to do it should go for it, even if it doesn't catch on.)

Was a simple format that allowed me to emulate 99% of games without hash checks, but when I mentioned this on IRC it was as if I said Hitler didn't go far enough. I don't get what's so special about iNES that it must be perfectly preserved in it's broken state, and any new formats must be backwards compatible with it.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />The main game cartridge format ought to describe what's on the PCB in enough detail that a functionally equivalent reproduction can be built. (The one exception to this that I can think of is an ADPCM playback chip in a few Famicom games such as Moero Pro Yakyuu.) Labels, boxes, instructions, and controller configuration can be handled with a separate file, just as the cartridge case, box, instruction manual, and controllers are separate physical things.<br /><br />What's so special about iNES is that the vast majority of dumps floating around are in this format, and it's still dead easy to parse even on an 8-bit machine.
