To make use of it would involve rewiring A12 on the cart edge to A12 on the PRG RAM skipping the MMC1 entirely. Then ground the cart A12 input on the MMC1 and use 4K mode, freeing all of $A000 for extra bank bits.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">Or you could make more of an extension of SXROM so that you could have 32kb of bankable PRG-RAM</div>
<br />I think the idea was to allow far more than 32 KB of nonvolatile memory: "up to 16MB of saved data without requiring a battery" as qbradq put it.

<br />
<br />So to use it as a latch you'd *have* to set the MMC1 in 4kb CHR-switching mode, and always set both Reg1 and Reg2 the same value, so that this latched value is constant on MMC1's CHR-A12 line.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I'm not sure what you mean about CHR A12. My idea is to connect CHR-RAM like you would on UNROM. Meaning the MMC1 wouldn't be controlling CHR at all. Modding an existing board might be hard. But part of the idea is if you needed more capacity a PCB with MMC1 clone could be designed with this high capacity method in mind.

<br />Even if the outputs of the MMC1 are not connected to the CHR chip, it will still make decisions based on the signals that are connected to it. Now that I think of it, it might be possible to trick the MMC1 by feeding it GND or Vcc instead of A12 from the NES, so that the it thinks that only one pattern table is ever accessed, which would allow you to use 4KB mode without having to write the bank number to both registers.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I'm still missing the deal with 8k versus 4k mode. I understand that in 4K mode if you don't have the same value in both CHR registers it'll bankswitch undesirably for PRG purposes. But if you are in 8K mode, and the output now controls upper PRG-ROM lines and no CHR-RAM lines, what exactly is the problem? Why are you needing 4K mode? 
<br />
<br />I'm not sure if I'm missing something or not. I understand your point tokumaru about pattern table access and the two CHR registers and 4K mode. But if you are in 8K mode then you don't have to worry about that at all anyway. Is there some reason you couldn't be in 8K mode?

Why are you needing 4K mode?</div><br />You need 4KB mode to make use of A12. In 8KB mode, since the MMC1 doesn't do any sort of management on the 4KB level, A12 just passes through, and the NES directly picks which 4KB (i.e. which pattern table) it wants. If it passes through, it has no use for bankswitching, so we don't want it to pass through, which is why 4KB mode is needed.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">Is there some reason you couldn't be in 8K mode?</div>
<br />Only if you want to use A12 for bankswitching purposes. If you only want to use A13 and up 8KB mode is fine.
