<br />I guess that being japanese doesn't make clones any better than the standard NOAC.

The graphics glitches start to show themselves when it asks the player to set side B.</div>
<br />FWIW, I got a new powerpak and I'm seeing similar symptoms now... so maybe we can figure this out.
<br />
<br />First, the FDS mapper in 1.31 (F.MAP) will work better than the old one (1.20).  So make sure you have that.
<br />
<br />If that doesn't work, you can give this one a try. <a href="http://home.comcast.net/~olimar/NES/powerpak_fds_alt.zip" class="postlink">http://home.comcast.net/~olimar/NES/powerpak_fds_alt.zip</a>  I made some small changes to it that that might make it work better.  
<br />
<br />Is Metroid the ONLY game that doesn't work?  For me, when Metroid isn't working, Zelda also fails (freezes after you enter a name and start the game).  So if it's only Metroid, maybe we're looking at a different problem.

<br />
<br />For me, every version of Metroid Great Hierophant tried (except the ones with parenthetical version numbers, I couldn't try them) refuses to load a save, with both the "regular" and alternate FDS mapper versions. All the versions of Zelda ("regular," [a], and [a1]) I've tried seem to work fine with both mappers.
<br />
<br />Other FDS issues I've seen (all of these happen with both mappers for me):
<br />
<br />Puzzle Boys (1990)(Atlus Ltd.) - freezes when saving.
<br />Lutter (1989)(Athena) - Freezes when trying to save from the menu with some really weird momentary horizontal blue artifacts on the whole screen.
<br />Namida no Soukoban Special (1986)(ASCII Corp.) - After a brief flash of "ERR 04," Keeps cycling between "Please wait" and "Flip to side A (or whatever), ERR 24" when attempting to return to the menu. Also freezes (on "please wait") when returning to the menu from edit mode.
<br />Silviana (19xx)(Pack-In-Video Co.) - Black screen after FDS BIOS.
<br />Kalin no Tsurugi (1987)(Xtalsoft - DOG) and [a] - Both versions seem to freeze whenever I try any writing to the disk, whether deleting a save game or saving a game already on the disk. Strangely, the translated version works fine.
<br />
<br />I tried all these games on Nestopia 1.4 and saw none of the above described issues, though I couldn't try saving in Lutter because the B button wasn't working.
<br />
<br />Whew. Well, I hope this information is of some use <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />

<br />
<br />what ? Are there more games like that? Why a waring ?!
<br />
<br />I had to remodify my rgb modded famicom to make it work with the Powerpak. Don't know what my modder had to change...

<br />
<br />I just noticed the -exact- same glitch. I was playing it on the powerpak, I go into the first cave and come out to go back to the town, and the airship is gone! This has to be something involving the WRAM. I have to test it out, but I think it happened when I didn't load a .sav file created when I first opened the game on my computer. This -could- have an effect on it. I'll have to see if it happens when I open the .sav file associated with the ROM on my CF. Also, I've noticed another VERY annoying glitch. Perhaps it's just me, but you know how you sometimes want to shut off the NES and save your game? Yeah, that never works for me with FF3 on the powerpak. I save my game, hold reset for 2-3 seconds, and it asks me if I want to write to a .SAV file. I do so, and shut the system off there. When I open it back up with that SAV file, no data was saved. Works in FF1, but not FF3. Has anyone else experienced problems with this on the powerpak? Am I saving my games correctly?

<br />I ran into the same glitch where the airship disappears. I think I still have the before and after disappearance .SAV files, if that helps.
