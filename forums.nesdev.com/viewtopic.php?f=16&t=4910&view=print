<br />Since the information must be useful in some way, shouldn't we just make it available on the wiki? That way, no more 404.  My 2 cent.

<br />I totally agree. Recently I've considered registering and adding stuff to the wiki myself, but apparently registration was disabled because of spam. Maybe I'd better not anyway, because I suck at explaining things in english.
<br />
<br />I wish the wiki was more complete. Whenever I try to use it as reference, I end up needing something that's just not there. I mean, there is a lack of mapper information, there are too many links to old documents (instead of clearer explanations of their contents) and stuff that just seems to have been pasted there in a hurry, without any good explanation of what that is and what purpose it serves. It's not a very good place to use as reference (yet).

<br />
<br />I agree with you.  What would need to be done is to take all existing documents about the nes and incorporate them inside the wiki, credit the original authors,  weed out the old information and put the most accurate one in it. That way, no more missing links in the future. The problem is who wants to do that since this job is not the most fun to do.  I would like to help on that someday, once I can finish the few tools I'm working on.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />With PowerPak becoming more widespread, with registration on the old wiki disabled, and with Atarimike not showing any evidence of activity there or here, we <em>might</em> need a new wiki. I've fired off an e-mail to Atarimike through the wiki's "E-mail this user" function. But if we do move to a new wiki, a new useful policy might include encouraging editors to provide sample source code where practicable, such as test routines for corner cases.

<br />This is a very good idea, because sometimes there's a page with many details about registers and such, but after reading that a person can be like "OK, I got it, but how do I use that? In what order do I write to these registers" and things like that.
<br />
<br />I also miss introductions and overviews in the wiki, because you often follow links and land in pages that do not make very clear what they are talking about, they just dump technical information all over the user. I believe that a proper introduction to each subject and small overviews of how things work are extremely necessary before jumping into the hardcore stuff.
<br />
<br />EDIT: Sorry to be talking about the wiki at the wrong place. Maybe a split is in order?
