		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Yeah, this raises some interesting points.  Really it makes me think the only way we can both see the best stuff, and have a level playing field is to expand the compo to have multiple categories.  That means more prizes to award too, which is great if the prize is still reasonable.  I propose that I could match koitsu's prize offer, and we can have 2 categories.  For fundraising I already have an account on <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/" class="postlink">http://www.kickstarter.com/</a> which might be helpful (not free though, 5% + whatever amazon's credit card fee is).  I was actually going to set something up on there for an very similar purpose, heheh.
<br />
<br />But if there were to be 2 categories, I would propose
<br />
<br />1: freestyle - anything goes, can be a game, demo, or NES app (native to NES).  Only restriction is it can't be a re-release of something you already released.
<br />
<br />2: minigame - either 16, 24, 32, 40kB?  I kind of lean towards 16 or 24kB.

<br />And as for the first, as long as we eliminate Blargg's 10000 color demo, I think that will be level, too <img src="./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" /> ^_^

Then again, even if people were to write a new engine they could use their already existing code base (e.g. sprite management, collision detection). There's no good reason not to and that would still be a huge advantage over someone starting his game completely from scratch.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">Jeroen wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">Yeah we cant actually check for reused code so cant really ban that.

<br />
<br />In my case it would still mean putting a lot of time into code, the engine's still missing a bunch of features while parts of it would need to be rewritten. Also, enemy behavior and event scripting would take a lot of code work.
<br />I'm just wondering where the "it's alright" stage ends and "you're a dick" begins.
<br />
<br />
<br />I, too, like the mini game idea. Sorry for bringing already discussed things up again, but I think 16k PRG+8k CHR using no advanced mapper features, i.e. NROM, would be a nice size restriction. It's easy to put on (multi-)carts and forces you to be modest when coming up with a game concept. It's more about the idea and creativity behind it than complexity and technical bragging.

IDK if it's really worth it since it's just a NROM game, but alot of NROM games don't use 8K extra ram, so there's ALOT of extra abilities that should be able to be achieved. Imagine what they would have added to SMB with 8K more of WRAM 0_o
<br />
<br />
<br />Well whatever happens we will live with it....I am thinking NROM restriction is good now but maybe there could be a NROM Minigame and MMC1 mapper category, where the NROM games are released on mini-game cart and the MMC1 winner gets put onto a cart, too. That way their could be two cartridges for this competition. A bunch of good tiny games on one cart, and a full-fledged game one another. Haha, I dont know how many would do a MMC1 GAME for the contest, though <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /> Just another thought.....

<br />Consider it done.  If folks decide on multiple compos, we can still put up the cash per-compo as well.  Just drop me a private note on the forum here and I'll respond.

<br />I wouldn't, because I hate the the way its registers are written to.
<br />
<br />I think that keeping programs small makes more sense for this compo. I think it's very unlikely that anyone will create more than 32KB of code/data in just a couple of months, so in a certain way that even discourages reutilization of existing programs, even though that can't be fully controlled.
<br />
<br />BTW, thanks koitsu and Mamblers for the help! I hope something good comes out of this idea!

<br />Like I said, there is no way to fully control whether existing code will be used, but even if you have a suitably small game that still has to be finished at least you will spend the time making the program as good as possible, instead of using the time to generate a lot of data, so I think 32KB is good either way.
<br />
<br />Personally I think that 16KB is a bit to restrictive, and is only really suitable for very repetitive games where the difference between levels is just the difficulty, without many layout changes.

<br />There's a reason it's called "Programmer Art" most of the time.  Most art done by programmers sucks.

<br />Ripped graphics should definitely not be allowed, IMO.
<br />
<br />To me art  has the same problems as music. I'm a decent artist, so graphics are not a problem for me, but I suck at making music (and coding music engines), while most of you can handle it just fine. I don't even know most of the terminology.
<br />
<br />This means I'll either have to take a stab at it anyway (and accept that the result will be probably far from outstanding) or find someone competent that's willing to help me, for whatever price we agree on.
<br />
<br />In my case, I'll probably give a shot at making the music myself. Looking for help is tempting, but if I ever expect to get better I gotta try it myself sometime.

<br />
<br />Yeah, definitely.  Same goes for ripped music.
<br />
<br />But I was thinking about the music today, and I think collaboration should be allowed (and even emphasized).  When it comes to re-using older stuff, at least in the 'unrestricted' category I believe that anyone's existing pixel art or NSF files, should be usable, unless it has been previously released in an executable NES ROM.
<br />
<br />So it also follows that you could use other people's code, assuming they released the source for that purpose.  NT2, Famitracker, random snippets of code from the Wiki and elsewhere.  Doesn't seem like there is much collaboration with anyone's NES projects, but it seems like most of them do release their source, at least.
<br />
<br />I think the minigame category is kind of self-limiting in that regard.. you won't use some epic song written in MML or some huge amount of graphics, just because of the size limit, if nothing else.
<br />
<br />If everyone has to do everything on their own, I'm sure we'll end up with a bunch of silent games and demos.  Also I think it should be considered that maybe we could allow someone could just opt out of being able to win a prize with it, and submit whatever they want that breaks all the rules if they just want to release something cool for the fun of it..

I was thinking cash, and maybe a ToToTek SNES flash cart if anyone's interested (I've got 3 other SNES flash carts so I don't really need it myself). I'll check back when the rules and deadline has been decided.

<br />For music you should probably allows covers. That will help people to get some music done, but it will still require some actual work to get a good-sounding cover (take chris' "Comic Bakery" cover for example). Not to mention that even commercial games on the old consoles / home computers had music that were covers or remixes of pieces of classical music or pop songs.
