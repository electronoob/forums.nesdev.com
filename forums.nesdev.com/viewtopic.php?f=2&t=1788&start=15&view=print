<br />If you set your sprites to 8x16 the selection nametable will be effectivly ignored.

<br />
<br />Here's the last part of my NMI routine before I restore the registers:
<br />
<br />	lda $2002	                ;reset $2006 flag
<br />	lda &lt;NamTab	;puts background to current nametable
<br />	sta $2006
<br />	lda #$00
<br />	sta $2006
<br />	lda &lt;Scrollx	;horizontal scroll
<br />	sta $2005
<br />	lda #$00
<br />	sta $2005
<br />
<br />NamTab is a variable containing either $20 or $24 which are the nametables I use. From my reading of Brad Taylor's "NES PPU addressing/scrolling operation details" vertical &amp; horizontal table selection latch/counters can be set by either bits 1 &amp; 0 of $2000 or bits 3 &amp; 2 of the first write to $2006 (after reading $2002). So since I am using 8 x 16 sprites I don't see what I have to gain from updating $2000 in VBlank (bit 3 of $2000 is ignored). Also I was under the impression that you should always set the PPU address by writing the proper values to $2006 towards the end of VBlank. Anyway, I tried your advice and updated $2000 at the end of VBlank and the same thing happened. If I'm missing something, please let me know.
<br />
<br />Marty:
<br />
<br />I just downloaded 1.32 and the same thing happened. I will send you the rom and the source code. Let me know what I can do to have my sprites show up on Nestopia. I really like the NTSC filter. It really helps optimize palette choices to avoid nasty NTSC effects.
<br />
<br />Thanks to all for the great help.

<br />The CopyNES BIOS initializes some of the system RAM for its own purposes.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I was playing around with the code and thinking about what everybody was saying and your advice finally sank in! Sorry if I seemed out of it. I realized that I was just assuming the NES memory would be $00 after a hard reset when of course I had absolutely no reason to expect that. In fact as was pointed out to me, the memory seems to be mainly set to $FF on power-on. It looks like Nestopia uses $FF to fill up memory. Anyway, I learned a valuable lesson: never assume a memory location contains a certain value unless I've initialized it to that value. Thanks to everyone for helping me out. Now I can use Nestopia's very helpful NTSC filter. Unlike most of you guys, I mispent my youth with my nose more or less to the grindstone when I should have been writing assembler. Now I have to catch up with the disadvantage of (a lot?) fewer neurons.

<br />
<br />I think it's a good idea to at least have an option to save the reset state at the beginning of a movie, since it offers some protection in case you ever change reset behavior of your emulator, or try to play the movie on another emulator. Emulators apparently vary widely in how they initialize memory at power-up. If you use any kind of compression on the movie, the initial state should compress to practically nothing (unless you're initializing RAM to random values).
