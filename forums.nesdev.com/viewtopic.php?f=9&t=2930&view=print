		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Since Quietust is no longer coming back (so it'd seem- he banned himself from these forums, and removed his bots from #nesdev, and quit the channel-- see the post in the PHPBB forum for more info.)  I think I will have to yank my windows support for CopyNES.
<br />
<br />I only have around 20 boards left, so I was going to stop selling the kits soon anyways.  I dunno if anyone else can pick up the torch or if Q will continue to even support it.  I suggest everyone download/mirror it for the future since I can't guarantee it will still be there tomorrow.
<br />
<br />I will of course continue to support the QBASIC version of the code, but I cannot support the windows one.  I don't know anything about windows programming to start with, let alone how to get it working on XP/2K.
<br />
<br />*
<br />
<br />On another subject, Q was always helping me add support for new dumps/mappers in Nintendulator, but I guess that's shot to hell now too.  I really need someone to help me test new mappers now.  If anyone wishes to do this, please let me know.  The only prerequisite is that you have to get on IRC to do it, since there is generally some back-and-forth getting things working, and this would be a PITA to do in email or whatever.

<br />It would be nice to hear more from Q himself on what his feature plans is. =/

<br />------------------
<br />On the CopyNES part.. I would be interested in buying another CopyNES for a friend if it's still possible at the end of the month.

<br />
<br />I am also interested in backup devices for all other systems if anyone knows where to get them or how to make them.
<br />
<br />Also, I don't know what your plans for the software side were, but if the source is available it shouldn't be too tough to get it to run on linux. I've done a little parallel port programming on it and it isn't too tough. don't know anything about a GUI though, and it sounds like that's what you needed.
