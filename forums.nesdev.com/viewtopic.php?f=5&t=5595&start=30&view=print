<br />Since I'm in an IT program at my school, I get a free MSDNAA membership which allows me to get pretty much any MS software for free (with the exception of MS Office, haha). I could even get MS 7 if I wanted to.
<br />
<br />I think it's rather ridiculous/odd, one of my classes focuses on learning Vista when MS 7 is just coming out. But I hear from many that 7 is basically a fixed version of Vista, so I guess if I learn everything about Vista I'll be able to use MS 7 easily. I don't know though; I'm still comfortable with XP. I don't feel like I need to dedicate fifty petabytes of RAM to have 3D windows with lighting effects. Now a real improvement would be a desktop touch screen UI, but that's another story I suppose.

<br />- Little slowdown with GBA, but major slowdown when VRAM viewer was enabled with auto refresh
<br />- Major slowdown with DS emulation (no game were playable)
<br />- Major graphic issues with PSX emulation, and much slow down too.
<br />- I haven't tried PS2 emulations, but seeing how it's really on the edge with my new PC, I guess it wouldn't have worked at all.
<br />
<br />It was a AMD Athlon 64 at 2.0 GHz, with 512 MB or RAM. Probably the error I did was to buy cheap stuff instead of medium/high end componants for it, so that it would have laster longer but I don't care my new laptop is so great I'm so delighted and it will probably last quite long (there is no point in emulating the PS2 much since I have the real thing, but it's always fun to take a greter depht in how games look internally).

<br />Exectly like me. You can also not get, say, Halo 2 for free (it would rock huh but it would be hard to say that is for professional reasons).
<br />
<br />And I guess W7 is somewhat a fixed version of vista... tough all transparent windows stuff is optional, there is no 3D stuff (you should confuse it with apple stuff, which, in my personal opinion, suck), and disabling it don't really reduce the amount of RAM used.
<br />In fact I've adopted the "modern" look of W7, I've selected the "in-between" theme which isn't exactly like old windows verison nor the most flashy available, and it's fine for me. Windows are slightly round instead of exactly square, and menu bars and stuff use slightly nicer colors, that's all.

<br />If you want to run out-of-region, hacked, or homebrew games on a PS2, you have to mod it. Or another way: Do PowerPak owners delete their NES emulators?

This is based on my experience with a friend of mine who's a TA at VT.<br /><br />My understanding is both correct and incorrect, given <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/academic/bb250614.aspx" class="postlink">two statements from Microsoft</a>:<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">Q.

No, MSDNAA software is intended for use in academic pursuits of STEM or VIDA disciplines: schoolwork, research, academic projects, and so on are all acceptable uses.<br /><br />Q. Can students keep these tools after they graduate?<br /><br />A. Yes, this license is perpetual and nontransferable. You don’t have to uninstall the tools, but the stipulation of “academic use only” does not change.</div>
<br />So I said, you don't actually own what you get access to/had access to (once you leave) as a student, but Microsoft lets you keep it after-the-fact regardless.  But this doesn't mean the software is licensed to you.
<br />
<br />And after-the-fact software is only permitted to be used for academic purposes even after you've left the university.  How Microsoft would enforce this is beyond me -- good luck there guys! -- but still.  You get the point I'm trying to make, I'm sure...

It's pretty much like you were saying, I guess. It's supposed to be used for academic purposes, but I don't see how MS could enforce that either. It would inconvenience them too much to check each student's saved work, and contact the school to talk to them about it. Still, the MSDNAA membership is very nice to have for free, as I was told it was a thousand dollars or something that the school had to pay for it for each student.

<br />
<br />I actually had some strange problems with my last PC (it isn't currently working, but I think it's fixable still) in terms of emulation. PSX emulation was pretty much flawless for me. There was never any slow-down or anything, and that PC was from 2004. DS and GBA emulation, however, were terrible. For a while I was able to run some games on the GBA emulator, but then I changed my graphics card and it was being very slow (which is weird, seeing that my new graphics card was an improvement from the previous one). DS games I could never play, and PS2 games were basically slide shows. I think I had either 1 or 2 GB of RAM (For some reason, I'm thinking 1). Actually, PS2 games crashed my PC lots of times, I think because it tried to use too much RAM.
<br />
<br />The current computer I am using could not run any of the things mentioned, and sound doesn't even work on it. I'm surprised it can run a NES emulator, haha.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Well you get a pretty high end if you got a X2 in 2005, it was just out or something. Glad it worked well for you. I don't remember why I picked a regular Athlon in 2006, maybe I took it because it was cheap and I was pretty broke back then ? Before that I used to have a VERY old PC like a pentium 1 - class I don't really remember it was baretly able to do very slow SNES emulation. Heh it's fun I should do a list of all PCs I've used with their specs and all so when I'll be old I'll look at the long list and see how stuff have evolued and say myself "oh my god".
<br />
<br />And yeah Celius it's weird GBA emulation would slow down if you upgraded your video card. You'd think at worst it wouldn't change a thing. I'm not sure if GBA games takes advantage of a GPU or not, however PS1 &amp; PS2 emulation DOES take advantage of a powerfull graphic card to speed up things, probably why it didn't work on my old PC which had a "passive" silent graphic cards (and a *very* noisy CPU fan, which make no sense at all, but hey it's over now). 
<br />
<br />
<br />I'm really surprised to see how much people were able to emulate PS1 for a long time. I really remember it was a pain configuring the graphic plug-in, there were a LOT of glitches, and slowdowns. Even the sound FX were off, but now it seems fixed, either because of my better PC, or because they updated the plugins, or both. 
<br />
<br />About MSNA, it doesn't make sense. Microsoft licence their software for free to their students. They can't force them to only use it for academic stuff, if they think students will use a PC for assiting them in their studies and another for personal hobbies stuff with a different copy of Windows, they're just completely off. 
<br />
<br />@Celius : Even my old 486 PC can do NES emulation with Nesticle (it does frame skip tough). That's kinda fun to think I *actually* used to play NES games like that back then.

<br />I didn't stop using DOS until '00 or '01.  I eventually even had a decent web browser, what my friend called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Arachne_VESA_Mode.png" class="postlink">"the Fred Flintstone browser"</a>

<br />Until around 2001 I had an old 486 notebook which I used mostly for games. I used Nesticle for the NES and Massage for the Master System. Both were pretty playable and I had lots of fun, even though there was no sound (that computer didn't even have a sound card). Massage was actually capable of outputting something through the PC speaker, but it didn't sound really good.

<br />I could try building a bare version of the library with a benchmark application to see the minimum frame rate it would achieve on a given system.
