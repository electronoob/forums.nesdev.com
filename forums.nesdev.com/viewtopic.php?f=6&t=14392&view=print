It's still a work in progress, and it doesn't yet support <a href="https://github.com/Qix-/pently/issues/4" class="postlink">the effects here</a> (except arpeggio) or converting noise instruments to sound effects, and it still doesn't fully support multiple songs yet. There are also still some problems with some songs I've tried, that I'm still working out.<br /><br /><a href="https://github.com/NovaSquirrel/ft2pently" class="postlink">GitHub repository</a> if someone wants to help on the code or compile it.

First you need to install Wine. And Wine doesn't work in non-i386 environments, such as the Raspberry Pi in NovaSquirrel's bedroom or the <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/viewtopic.php?p=163843#p163843" class="postlink">AMD64-only PC in calima's room</a>. True, ft2pently users will already have either Windows or Wine installed as a dependency of FamiTracker, but people writing directly in Pently-MML might not. Finally, I'd need to learn how to install a cross-compiler on the computer that I primarily use to develop Pently, which runs <a href="https://xubuntu.org/" class="postlink">an OS based on Debian GNU/Linux</a>, so that I can create MinGW binaries, and I'd need to rewrite everything line by line in C++ and eat the overhead of maintaining C++ compared to maintaining Python.<br /><br />Perhaps I could continue to distribute the Python version as free software, make a line-by-line translation into C++ that's not updated as often, make the C++ translation proprietary software, charge for copies of the C++ translation to cover the cost of purchasing a genuine Windows license on which to test a MinGW port, the cost of my time keeping the Windows installation updated, and the cost of my time making the C++ translation. I imagine most users of Windows would install Python to work around this, just as they install Oracle's Java virtual machine to play Minecraft.

This is solvable by just including a premade NTSC or PAL table, and I already do this in my games. It's not the language used for generating the table, but the fact that the step is there at all.<br /><br />Rewriting pentlyas in C++ would be a waste of time, because I think the only people who care about having to get Python are Windows users, and you can have a py2exe build available for them. When I release a Windows build of ft2pently I'm going to include an exe of pentlyas alongside it.<br /><br />---<br /><br />I can try to help with an asm6 port of Pently. I'd like to know if <a href="https://github.com/Qix-/pently/issues/4" class="postlink">the rest of these effects</a> have any demand. If they're not important I'm probably going to work on optimizing the resulting files for ROM space.

But my honest opinion of the matter is, I can't agree more on the choice of Python for his script compared to C/C++. I would do exactly the same. I might be one of the few in this forum to strongly advocate C++, but you can't beat the productivity of a scripting language, especially one with tons of libraries like Python. I can't count the times I wrote scripts using Python that were simple, almost &quot;throw away&quot; programs done really quickly that would be <em>much</em> longer to write in C++, and do not even mention C. In a matter of hours I made a code generator for C using Python that rendered several characters of a particular font to 1bit bitmap and encoded them into a RLE-like format, then generated a source code containing arrays with the bitmap data, structs with metadata and pointer to those arrays, and finally an array of those structs. Even with my experience it would have taken a couple of days making the same thing using C++.<br /><br />tepples, please ignore the complaints about some &quot;Python&quot; dependencies, it's not worth <em>your time</em>. After all, you made the tools for you, didn't you. And frankly, Python causes less problems in porting to Windows that supporting any kind of compiling setup, be it cross-compiling or using a separate VM to develop for Windows. When problem arises, you can fix the Windows compatibility problem in a matter of minutes. Heck, even the user can modify the script to test and fix things.
