There is <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/viewtopic.php?f=3&amp;t=10300" class="postlink">this</a> &quot;information&quot; and I read it. But I don't develop the emulator for &quot;other&quot;, I'm doing this for me to better understand how those devices work and to have fun. Anyway: currently I have finished the CPU, memory management and the controller input and I've started with the PPU, the challenging part for me. Everything which is related to the memory mangement inside the PPU (DMA, VRAM etc.) is trivial for me. I've a problem understanding how the frames are &quot;rendered&quot;.<br /><br />In order to get started with the PPU I read <a href="http://txstateprojects.googlecode.com/svn-history/r62/trunk/6502/NESDoc.pdf" class="postlink">this nice</a> document. But it doesn't really tell me how the rendering process of one frame actually works. I also looked into some documents <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20020123071436/http://nesdev.parodius.com/" class="postlink">from here</a>. But nowhere is the conceptual advance of the PPU described.<br /><br />So could you please give me an overview of rendering one frame? Or what steps I need to perform to get a frame rendered?<br /><br />I could look into any existing code, but this tells me not the general &quot;roadmap&quot; but rather many technical details I don't want to know at this time.<br /><br />Greetings,<br />mrhyde

It's like trying to understand source code without a clear idea of the overall architecture. That's what I understand you to be saying, and maybe the links answer some of it. It wouldn't surprise me of they don't, as once one has an overview, one doesn't forget so doesn't need to document, while the details are easily forgotten and written down.

That's what I understand you to be saying, and maybe the links answer some of it.</div><br />thats what I'm talking about.<br /><br />Anyway I decided to start with some topic in the hope that I'll end with a working PPU. So I got my hands on the pattern tables and build a little debug output. Fine. Now I'm trying to get something out of the name and attribute tables and encountered a question:<br /><br />I might not read carefully enough but everywhere stands that the 960 name table bytes &quot;fill&quot; the entire screen with tiles and every byte refers to an index in the pattern table. This makes sense. But nowhere stands how this works. With a byte I can only address up to 256 pattern table indicies. But both pattern tables together have 512 indices to address. So what is my misunderstanding?<br /><br />And a second question: there is only one collision detection only with sprite 0 (e.g. the sprite located at index 0 in SPR RAM)? Right?<br /><br />Greetings,<br />mrhyde

You just repeat this over and over, modifying the rendering parameters as the registers are written to.</div><br />The PPU runs alongside the CPU, doing its own thing, which is rendering picture frames over and over based on the contents of VRAM/ROM and the values of its internal registers. For details of what happens when, check the <a href="http://wiki.nesdev.com/w/index.php/PPU_rendering" class="postlink">wiki</a>. Then read about the <a href="http://wiki.nesdev.com/w/index.php/PPU_registers" class="postlink">registers</a> and how they affect the PPU.

Depending on other bits written to the same port, sprites can use the same bank, use the other bank, or use 8x16 pixel sprites from both banks.
