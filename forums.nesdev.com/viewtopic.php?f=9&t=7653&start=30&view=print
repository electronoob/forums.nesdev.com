		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Oh nifty, that makes sense then. I'm just trying to think about how it would do this on a hardware level. For example, it might have two latches, and each read gets pushed into those latches, and if the PPU fetches a particular address, and that same address is in both of the latches, then it clocks the scanline counter. That would mean that each additional read after the first two would clock the scanline counter. However, the only way to test this would be to pull a Kevin Horton and feed the MMC5 some custom "PPU" signals directly.
<br />
<br />That's a good find though, if the quirk only happens when the trick tile is on the third column of the screen specifically, then that means the MMC5 would indeed be looking for 3 (or more) identical fetches.

The fetches at x=337 and x=339 of one line have the same address as the fetches at x=1 of the next line.<br /><br />Now we just need to figure out how to do the same thing with fewer I/Os. I'd bet just watching for several consecutive reads with bit 13 set ($2000-$3FFF) would do it. The most consecutive fetches you get from $2000-$3FFF during a scanline is two, and the end of a scanline has four: x=337, x=339, x=1, x=3.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">Does this means it's possible to clock the MMC5's counter artificially by tweaking $2006 and $2007 manually ?</div>
<br />I remember reading somewhere that the MMC5 watches writes to $2001: if the background and sprites are disabled, the counters doesn't get clocked. Or it could detect the post-render scanline somehow.

<br />
<br />It looks great for a beta mapper ! You don't have to worry about it being incomplete, apparently most things works great, it's just the sound is lacking.
<br />And it's probably quite simple to implement since it's like the 2A03 but with the most complex part (the sweep) out.
<br />
<br />If only I was able to play with .MAP files I would sure do some experiments... but I have no idea how to achieve this.
<br />
<br />
<br />Back on the subject about how MMC5 detects the VBlank/Frame, I don't know but I have some feeling that it's something dead simple nobody ever thought.
<br />Like a particular fetch the PPU does at the beginning which simply enables the "frame" mode - which would be easy to replicate by reading $2007 during VBlank and trick the MMC5 into thinking the frame has begun.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />It'd be pretty nice to know if the PPU's fetches during the prerender scanline are unique in some way. As in, because the fetched data is just thrown away, is it valid nametable/attribute data for the scanline that would be displayed? Or is the PPU fetching some bullshit addresses (similar to how the PPU fetches the same nametable byte twice at the end of the scanline to waste time)? If the PPU is doing something like fetching $0000 over and over again, the MMC5 could be using that to detect the start of a frame.
<br />
<br />As for how it detects the end of the frame, it could just simply be using the scanline counter and counting until the last scanline is rendered. To test for this, you could use my test rom again, but wait in a loop for the in-frame flag to be unset, and have some kind of onscreen indication for when it happens (such as setting the monochrome bit). Perform the ruler-moving-up quirk, and see if it causes a monochrome section of the screen to slide up too.

<br />
<br />and last days I was implementing MMC5 for it.
<br />I made it using the directives here:

<br />and it works really great (tested on Castlevania 3). There are some minor chr glitches, but they might be due to the mistake in assigning banks, I need to check it again.
<br />
<br />When I find three consecutive accessess by the ppu to the same address, I treat it as a begin of new scanline.
<br />When I find that the CPU is accessing $FFFA, it means that the PPU ended  generating frame.
<br />
<br />Try guys to disable the NMI generation by PPU and see if MMC5 still correctly detects end of frame.

<br />Sounds like a simple way to count scanlines, that could be used in new mappers developed by the community for future homebrews.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Hello again!
<br />I will describe it soon if you wish <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />
<br />Yea, the black-square box inside is a Spartan XC3S200 FPGA, which emulates mappers. There are currently support for NROM, UNROM (UOROM), CNROM, BNROM, GNROM, ANROM, MMC1, MMC3, MMC5, CAMERICA (71 &amp; 232), JALECO (18). The FPGA utilization level is 62%.
<br />PRG ROM 512KB, CHR ROM 512KB, PRG RAM 32KB, CHR RAM 32KB, support for 4mirroring. Games are loaded from MMC card - full fat16 implementation for 6502 from scratch ;]
<br />
<br />The design is ready for PRG ROM chips up to 4MB, but I've never found such large FLASH ROMS (I'm using 29F040 which is 512KB. 29F080 is 1MB, but it is rare).
<br />4 x 29F040 can be connected in parallel with LS319 decoding, but there will be too many wires and too many noise.
<br />
<br />However, I need to ask for some help! I implemented MMC5  (it is almost complete, with all features except the vertical split).
<br />I tested the features on home-made mmc5 test roms (for example - the extended tile/attributes, extra nametable) and it works OK.
<br />
<br />The one game that I am focused on is Castlevania 3. It works really great except one minor flaw in the intro. Few days ago I thought it's because some mistakes in assigning banks, but checked everything 3 times and seems to be ok.
<br />
<br />I thought also that's because it might use extended tile/attributes, extra nametable but now it is implemented and it still flaws. As I guess, Castlevania does not use split scrolling - the only STA $5200 opcode (hexadecimally 8D0052) is at $3E100 offset in the NES file and it's a part of such routine:
<br />
<br /><img src="http://obrazki.elektroda.net/59_1334568978.png" alt="Image" /> 
<br />
<br />so storing #00 here definitely turns off the splitting.
<br />Also checked for any STXes and STYes at this address and none was found.
<br />
<br />It is the video how it looks on my cart.. (for those impatients - it's at 1:30)
<br />
<br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://youtu.be/OrYAC_1bNSk">http://youtu.be/OrYAC_1bNSk</a><!-- m -->
<br />
<br />See that the title screen is correct for a second, then something get switched and it breaks.
<br />
<br />Inspecting how it plays at the FCEUX emulator and taking look at the nametables and pattern tables I see exactly the same behaviour (in the name table's window), but in the game window everything is ok of  course.
<br />
<br />Click on the image for enlargement.
<br />
<br />That's just a second before the fatal switch:
<br />
<br /><a href="http://obrazki.elektroda.net/65_1334569394.png" class="postlink"><img src="http://obrazki.elektroda.net/65_1334569394_thumb.png" alt="Image" /></a> 
<br />
<br />and that's after:
<br />
<br /><a href="http://obrazki.elektroda.net/53_1334569225.png" class="postlink"><img src="http://obrazki.elektroda.net/53_1334569225_thumb.png" alt="Image" /></a> 
<br />
<br />When I played it in nesticle, it behaved the same way like on my dev-cart!
<br />
<br />Strange thing is that at the second screen, the big Castle Vania text is displayed correctly in the game window, but there aren't any pattern tables for it!
<br />
<br />Very similar behaviour can be seen in the MMC3 game - Doki Doki Yuuenchi (Doki Doki Amusement Park):
<br />
<br /><a href="http://obrazki.elektroda.net/90_1334569584.png" class="postlink"><img src="http://obrazki.elektroda.net/90_1334569584_thumb.png" alt="Image" /></a> 
<br />
<br />The scrollbar with START/PASSWORD text is buggy in name table window and there aren't any fonts in pattern tables!
<br />However, it is working because this game uses IRQ counter - it sets the irq counter at the scanline just before the START/PASSWORD text and when it is fired, it quickly swapps the chr banks so that the text is rendered using different pattern tables.
<br />But this game runs correctly on my dev-cart!
<br />
<br />Similar actions might be used in the CastleVania 3, but I also implemented IRQ counter in MMC5 and it seems to work correctly (tested it for example on the Laser Invasion MMC5 game - and when the IRQ counter was not implemented, ths game glitched  and blinked). Also, Castlevania 3's title screen wasn't displayed at all without the IRQ Counter.
<br />
<br />Have you got any guesses?

<br />
<br />I'm just guessing here but is it possible your IRQ counter is off by a scanline or a few dots on your MMC5?   Your test using Laser vision might not be conclusive that your IRQ counter is working properly if it's not sensitive to being off a scanline or a few dots.  I would think it's probable that your on the right scanline but wrong dot.  If that's the case I would guess some games won't care, but others will which might be your issue.
<br />
<br />I'm not sure when the MMC5 fires an IRQ exactly but if you can't figure it out I can *try* to get a sample using my logic analyzer for CV3 on that screen.

<br />Thanks for reply - the problem was solved!
<br />It was indeed connected with the IRQs.
<br />
<br />Hovewer, it really does not matter if the irq is fired late a scanline, a dot or something (the banks will be switched one scanline too late, but that won't be quite vissible).
<br />
<br />I have examined in details what castlevania 3 does in the title screen:

In NTSC it is invissible. Because PEGASUS it is an NTSC console with forced PAL (probably the same as russian DENDY), it can be seen on my tv <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />Nevermind, after that it changes CHR bank.<br />The next IRQ is set to be fired at scanline $D0 (this is variable - as the title screen advances, this value is decreased (the next IRQ is fired more and more early). After that, the second CHR bank switch takes place.<br /><br />I am writing my dev-cart in VHDL and have two separate processess (one which is responsible for the CPU part and one for the PPU).<br /><br />And I have also such signals as mmc5_ppu_in_frame, mmc5_irq_pending, and some others (no matter).<br /><br />Hovewer, becase those two signals need to be changed by both of the processes:<br /><br />mmc5_irq_pending must be cleared after $5204 read - the "CPU" process is doing that, but it also must be set after PPU notices that the current scanline number matches the one at $ 5203 - the "PPU" process is doing that.<br /><br />Similar with the second signal.<br /><br />Because one signal cannot be driven by the two processes, I had to make some `trick` - I added some more signals:<br />mmc5_irq_pending_set_req (set request)<br />mmc5_irq_pending_set_ack (set acknowledge)<br />So the the CPU is driving the irq_pending signal as it wants, but when the PPU wants to set it high, it sets mmc5_irq_pending_seet_req to '1';<br /><br />When the CPU notices that mmc5_irq_pending_set_req equals '1', it<br />sets mmc5_irq_pending to '1' and sets mmc5_irq_pending_set_ack to '1'.<br /><br />When the PPU notices that the mmc5_irq_pending_set_ack is '1', it clears<br />mmc5_irq_pending_set_req to '0'.<br />And when the CPU notices that the mmc5_irq_pending_set_req is '0', it clears the mmc5_irq_pending_set_ack to '0';<br /><br />So it is some kind of handshake <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br />The CPU_PROCESS is activated on rising edge on M2.<br />The PPU_PROCESS is activated on falling edge on PPU_!RD or falling edge on PPU_!WR.<br /><br />However, before it started to work it was a little bit exchanged - the PPU process was driving the mmc5_irq_pending signal and the CPU process was setting mmc5_irq_pending_clear_req if it wanted to pull it down.<br />And it didn't worked as good because the PPU process is not active during VBLANK because PPU_!RD and PPU_!WR is high there! So if the CPU wanted to pull it low during VBLANK, it was pulled low by the PPU_PROCESS but after the VBLANK.<br /><br />The CPU PROCESS is active all the time (the M2 is changing low to high all the time)<br /><br />So it was my ingenious idea to change the roles <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br />Sorry for such long description, thought someone might need it in the future.<br /><br />BTW. I love reading DISCH's notes about mappers, for example:<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">&nbsp;Detailed Operation:<br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; The IRQ counter is an up counter, rather than a down counter &#40;like MMC3&#41;.&nbsp; Every time the MMC5 detects a<br />&nbsp;scanline, it does the following:<br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;- If In Frame Signal is clear...<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; a&#41; Set In Frame signal<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; b&#41; Reset IRQ counter to 0<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; c&#41; Clear IRQ pending flag &#40;automatically acknowledging IRQ&#41;<br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;- otherwise...<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; a&#41; Increment IRQ counter<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; b&#41; If IRQ counter now equals the trigger value, raise IRQ pending flag<br /></div>
<br />Such detailed and algorithmic approach makes no ambiguities and implementing that is just piece of cake!  This guy should be awarded a medal.
