That *could* be useful if you were to store data in banks beyond what you set the limit to to prevent anything from writing those banks. But I see no reason to do that. It would be more useful if the upper nibble was like the ROM page select of the lower nibble and could isolate a section for you. <br /><br />Since you've looked at the patch you've probably seen it's pretty simple. Remove the possible SRAM limiting as we need to control the whole chip. Then it just selects the desired bank before transferring execution to the game. Most games don't initialize the register since there is no need but some games do and ofcourse games with 32 kilobytes of RAM will be constantly writing it. But they shouldn't disturb the upper banks. <br /><br />If I were to list improvements to be made to the SmartCard they would be:<br /><ul>$7000 Register Write Protection<br />SRAM Bank Limiting<br />MBC1/2/3 ROM Bank Register Mode ($2000-$3FFF rather than $2000-$2FFF with $3000-$3FFF for 9th bit)</ul><br />With all of those it would pretty much eliminate the need for patches.

Detailed info on master registers of EMS cart is needed and so far i haven't found it on net.<br /><br />that is why what MottZilla accomplished is a great thing and could be accomplished by reverse engineering(or debugging).<br /><br />it would be great if EMS would publish the use of master registers. Their flashing program is buggy and under-featured and this hurts the potential of their flash cart.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I'm not sure how much we need exact details on the Master Bank register. I suppose if you wanted to totally rewrite a new menu that would help. With some experimenting or careful reading of the code you could probably figure out what the lower nibble of the value means exactly. I might investigate it at some point. <br /><br />I'm not too interested in save game compression because what happens if you have a number of save games compressed and then some change in the data causes the save to get bigger and now you don't have room anymore? <br /><br />Though you did make me think with some SRAM management in a new menu you could support multiple 32Kbyte saves by using the Menu to manually copy data between slots. The current patch works pretty well, but actually the need for &quot;save fixes&quot; could also be avoided if the save banks were always copied to banks 0-3 before starting the game. So that is a good idea, but you potentially lose some save slots. I'd say you'd have 88Kbytes or 11 Banks to save data. That's 2 less games than the current setup which isn't so bad I guess. You could then manage to fit 5 games that save at once with two of those being 32kbytes in size. <br /><br />Another thought is if you add SRAM management to a new menu, the bank reserved for the Menu could hold also custom save game titles. Then when you change games on your cartridge you could use the read SRAM option and then use a tool to see the contents of your SRAM to extract the saves you want. Although if you make it so after choosing a game you choose SRAM slots that could work too without you having to worry about using a PC tool to manage SRAM. So there is potential for a new menu to improve.

As I understand it, the first partition reserves 32K of the 128K of S-RAM in the Multicart.  But the menu program arranges ROMs by size, so the 32K S-RAM game will not likely be in the first game slot.   But in the 2nd through 13th slot, it is apparently allocated only 8K of SRAM.  Will the game take the next three 8K partitions?

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Basically any 32K game is going to set the RAM Bank register itself. So it doesn't matter which slot it goes in at all. Games that only have 1 bank and don't write the ram bank register will use whatever the menu set for it, which is based on which slot it is in. <br /><br />Thanks for the list. Is that a complete list by chance? Also I'm looking to write a new menu to manage SRAM in a different way.<br /><br />Again the first 32K of the SRAM will be reserved for the game running. The last 8K will be reserved for the Menu program, leaving 88K for save storage. The idea would be to manage saves independently of the slots they are stored by using the title string as an identifier. Basically when saving the menu would try to match the name of the game being saved to one of the existing records. If no record is found then it would try to find space to make a new record. If it can't it'll inform you that the data couldn't be saved and that you need to free more room. There would be a menu for managing your records. And ofcourse when loading a game that has battery backup it would automatically search your list of records for a title string match and if found it would load your data. The reserved bank would also hold variables to know if the last game launched needs to be saved the next time the menu runs, to avoid requiring the user to manually backup data before playing another game. <br /><br />I think it'll work out, even though you will lose some save slots compared to the current menu you will have more control over your save data and if you choose to change the games on your cartridge you won't lose your saves. A simple PC tool could be made to manage the 128KB extracted saves on your computer if for some reason you needed to backup individual saves. This would be easier with the new idea than the current menu since the program would have an idea of what data is in what bank.<br /><br />By the way what do you mean Fix required? Fix to run on the SmartCard right? Link's Awakening requires a fix or else it will crash if you press A+B+Select+Start and use the Save &amp; Quit option.
