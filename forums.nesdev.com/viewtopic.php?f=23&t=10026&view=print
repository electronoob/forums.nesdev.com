		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Lately I've been writing an YM player for the Neo Geo Pocket Color. In case you don't know, .YM files are register logs (16 bytes per frame) for the YM2149 chip and its clones (like the AY-3-8910). These chips were used in the Atari ST, ZX Spectrum, Amstrad CPC, and probably a lot of other '80s home computers and arcade machines.<br /><br />While the sound chip in the NGPC is quite similar to the one found in the SEGA Master System, which in turn is relatively similar in capabilities to the YM/AY chips, there were differences that made me not choose to emulate the YM/AY using the NGPC's PSG (for example, it can't generate low-enough frequencies).<br /><br />So what I do instead is to generate PCM data and output it to the NGPC's 8-bit audio DACs. This is of course a lot more CPU-intensive, so I had to settle for very low sample rates. Currently the maximum output sample rate I've been able to use is 8 kHz. The NGPC's main CPU (a TLCS-900/H) runs at 6.144 MHz, with every two cycles making up one CPU <em>state</em>. At an 8 kHz sample rate this gives me 3072000/8000 = 384 states per sample. The fastest instructions take 2 states to complete, but most take more.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtuFPE0oiiA" class="postlink">Here's a video</a> of the first version which used a 6 kHz sample rate.<br /><br />And <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jG4FxULo9N0" class="postlink">here's a video of an optimized version</a> using an 8 kHz sample rate. I've also made <a href="http://jiggawatt.org/badc0de/nymp-2.zip" class="postlink">the ROM</a> available for this version, which you can run on your NGPC if you happen to own a flash cart (I'm unsure if there are any emulators available that will run it correctly).

Sadly, it is known from earlier attempts on the software AY emulation on Z80 at 10 MHz fully dedicated to it is not enough to complete emulation of the chip, with the noise and envelope (the best part of the chip) generators with nice quality. I guess TLCS-900 at 3 MHz processing power is close to Z80 at 10 MHz.<br /><br />By the way, in fact AY is the original, YM is a clone.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Well, I can probably get it up to 9.6 kHz with some more work. But I believe 16 kHz would be the lower limit for where it would start sounding half-decent.<br />I've been considering various ways of moving parts of the emulation to the sound co-processor (a 3.072 MHz Z80) - for example the envelope generation, which is the most expensive part. But I haven't yet come up with a cheap way that would keep the two processors in sync.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Do I feel silly. I had been hunting cycles everywhere I could find them in my playback code, and it still didn't add up. I'd counted the best-case and worst-case cycles manually but for some reason the code seemed to perform worse than it should when I actually ran it on my NGPC.<br /><br />It wasn't until yesterday that I (accidentally) realized that I had put an absolute jump at the end of my playback loop, instead of a long relative jump. My code runs from RAM (which is faster because of the wider bus), but because of this error, every sample except the first one of each buffer would be generated and mixed by code running from ROM.<br />At least this had made me look harder for ways of optimizing the code compared to what I otherwise might have.<br /><br />And with that I give you some videos of YM files being played back at 16000 Hz on my NGPC:<br /><br /><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oxcJrfyqyJc" class="postlink">Saboteur 2</a><br /><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oi53Ur-eQds" class="postlink">Pablo and the gold of Montezuma</a><br /><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fy9W-onDFsg" class="postlink">DOC Zak 1</a><br /><br /><a href="http://jiggawatt.org/badc0de/nymp-3.zip" class="postlink">Here's a zip file</a> with the corresponding ROMs.

Furthermore, Sunsoft 5B audio in NSF is also a clone of AY-3-8910, too (and I suppose it might be logged to VGM). What programs are there to write musics for this chips other than ppMCK and VGMCK and Vortex Tracker? (There is also AY8930, which VGM format supports and VGMCK can be used to write music for it, but VGMPlay does not yet support. Is your program compatible with AY8930?)

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Most instructions that operate on registers alone take 4 cycles. Most common instructions go from 4 to 20 in steps of 2 cycles, all comes down to the addressing modes used and whether or not you deal with byre/word or longs. Every byte/word access is 4 cycles, longs take 8 cycles. Register operations don't normally add extra cycles, arithmetic adds in steps of 2, depending on operation. Address register increment comes for free, and arranging your data for sequential access makes things lovely.
