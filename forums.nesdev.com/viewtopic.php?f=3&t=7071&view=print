		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />In a post on the Romhacking.net message board, Farid (Kunio) raised the point about Nestopia mis-detecting a hacked Japanese ROM as US Region, so Nestopia selected to emulate a NES 4-player adapter instead of a Famicom 4-player adapter, so the game's 4-player mode stopped working.
<br />
<br />Looking at the NES 2.0 specification, I see nowhere where it distinguishes games intended for the Famicom and games intended for the NES, or indicates what kind of peripheral is suggested for the game (ie, make Duck Hunt want a Zapper).
<br />
<br />Obviously, this is an issue with Nestopia being too reliant on the ROM database, but wasn't NES 2.0 designed to answer the ambiguous questions that a ROM database would otherwise solve?

<br />
<br />Yes, I did plan on having a controller designation field on 2.0.  
<br />
<br />Since I have been going over my FPGA NES again lately (converting it from schematic entry to verilog)  I have been tinkering with the inner guts some more, and I was going to write up my NES 2.0 submappers and things.
<br />
<br />
<br />As a heads-up on what I have done with 2.0, I converted all of the GoodNES stuff that needed a special database into 2.0 ROMs so my loader didn't need said database.   I just sorta failed to document it.  whoops.  
<br />
<br />So now I have been going back over it and documenting the stuff that I figured out.  
<br />
<br />If there's still enough interest I will polish up the spec with a complete list of games that benefit from 2.0 along with headers (or ips or whatever) for them.
<br />
<br />note that this includes a good 50% or more of the Vs games-  I actually bought 20 or so Vs games off of ebay to acquire this information, along with RGB PPU palettes and custom lockout chips present on the Namco Vs. games.
<br />
<br />If there's anything else that should be added to the 2.0 header, let me know.  I hear a call for controller type (which is a good idea).  Would a system type flag(Fami, NES) be beneficial if it had a controller field?
<br />
<br />The Vs. fields include PPU type, namco "custom" (their designation) chip type, and I believe controller mapping.
