<br />
<br />As for timing it... you must know that each scanline consists of 341 PPU cycles... the first 256 of which render pixels on the scanline.  So if sprite 0 hit happens on, say, pixel 120 of the scanline... then $2002.6 is raised on PPU cycle 120 of the scanline (on an NTSC system, this would translate to CPU cycle 40 of the scanline -- 113.6666667 CPU cycles per scanline).
<br />
<br />Rouding that time off to the start or end of the scanline might cause the timing to go off in some games.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />be carefull with nestress, i when i was starting i supossed nestress was very fiable, but it is not. As a starting point for cpu emulation and ppu emu is fine, but... i remember when nestress throw me constantly that ADC Overflow operation was OK and some games have errors cos it wasnt at all OK.
<br />Just an advice.
<br />
<br />Disch wants to say that "when the game exepct it" you can calculate it of how many cpu cycles has to pass to sprite hit flag goes up
<br />and if your emu ppu timing is correct or in other way nearly exact calculating the cycles to pass to hit flag to set is cool.
<br />
<br />But, you mentioned before you dont want or you are not interested in Brad Taylor "2C02 Referece" wich is a crucial doc to have a good understading on NES Architecture for (al least at a functional level, which is fine for emu dev) a good emulation (altought mmc3 topic is bad).
<br />Understading that doc will clarify a lot of your doubts (which are already explained there).
<br />I tell you becouse when i was starting my project a lot of things where unclarify for me. So i talk you from my expirience and thanks to other people who helped me here in the forum.

<br />
<br />Let's just clarify one thing. If a sprite's pixel (i.e. 1-3 in the palette indicies (NOT including att colour?)) is also on the same pixel as a background pixel (i.e. !Transparent) then the hit flag is set. Is this correct?
<br />
<br />This is now the only graphical issue I have left with my emulator and I am now very keen to get onto memory mapping and other things. So please help!!!

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />First: DONT TRUST NESTRESS, you should only trust in games that need sprite 0 hit if they work ok (smb, castlevania, etc). Its difficult (i know) to have an accurate engine for all games.
<br />
<br />Second:
<br />This can help for you scanline based engine:
<br />
<br />- ONE scanline takes 341 / 3 =  113.67~ CPU Cycles ("~" means approx.)
<br />- You have to take into account how much cpu cycles takes a scanline to be rendered. It should be 256 ppu cyles / 3 = 85 cpu cycles. 
<br />- And (341 - 256) ppu cycles / 3 = 28.3~ cpu cycles. You should do NOTHING since it is HBLANK
<br />
<br />Third:
<br />Instead of setting hit flag when the ppu is rendering you can calculate how many cycles will take until it will be "set" this can be done in this way:
<br />
<br />- There are 341/3 cpu cycles per scanline
<br />- There are 240 scanlines rendered (including the dummy one)
<br />- You know sprite zero is in scanline (going from 0 to 240) 17 (Y Position) , but there are only pixels in scanline 19!! , but you have to know that Y pos is programmed one scanline minus the scanline it will appear on, so sprite 0 will render in scanline 20!, now you can do something like this:
<br />
<br />20 scanlines * 341 ppu cycles = 6820 ppu cycles will take sprite hit since scanline 0 starts render to set the hit flag, which equals to: 6820 ppu cycles / 3 = 2273.34~ cpu cycles. After your cpu cycles counter is &gt;= of that value you should set the 2002.5 flag.
<br />
<br />Please correct me if im wrong.
<br />
<br />I know its not the most accurate way of calculating sprite zero hit but you can take it like a begining.

<br />
<br />If you're setting the sprite 0 hit flag when you draw the sprites (according to that layout)... then yes.
<br />
<br />Say, for example, Sprite 0 hit happens on pixel 90 of the scanline.  Normally this will mean that the Sprite 0 hit flag will be raised on PPU cycle 90 of the scanline (90/3 =  CPU cycle 30).  If you're running the CPU for a full scanline <strong>before</strong> looking for sprite 0 hit.. then the flag will be raised after the scanline is complete... on CPU cycle 113 of the scanline... <span style="text-decoration: underline">83</span> CPU cycles later than it should.
