I hoped to make it so there is still an attract mode while it's in freeplay, and also so it can display name/instructions regardless of the PROM (of course with a customized instruction ROM per game), while hopefully still being able to read original boards as usual.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">I've finished the layout for a Playchoice board, substituting the RP5H01 with a CPLD.</div><br />That sounds interesting.

						<div class="postbody">I get the page header and footer of the mexican page. In the page body it's saying invalid address and sth about trying to access googleads with flash9 - which maybe means needing windows xp to view that page. Moment, just tried via a remote desktop virtual winxp machine - now I see it!
<br />That's a funny hardware config, the small PCB is a SNES to NSS adaptor, without games on it, but apparently with PROM and INST-ROM ripped from that "Super Copa" game. That, just to satisfy the BIOS (which won't boot the SNES/PRG ROM if it can't decrypt the INST-ROM). If Super Copa is dubious, then that hack is double-dubious.
<br />But, <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.snescentral.com/article.php?id=0791">http://www.snescentral.com/article.php?id=0791</a><!-- m --> sounds as if Super Copa was a legit localized game - from same company as the NSS basketball game. Quite possible that Super Copa for NSS did also exist as licensed title.

<br />There is a PC10 schematic? Good that you mention that! Ah, yes, found it. Will be very useful if I do something with the PC10, and may be also useful for getting an idea how the NSS works. Yup, the DATA and COUNTER pins are inverted and then passed straight to the Z80 databus. Then the "security.prm" files are both bit-reversed and bit-inverted. Ie. the .prm files contain 0 and 1 as seen by the Z80, but not as how they are actually stored in the PROM (aka, in your CPLD PROM-clone).</div>

						<div class="postbody">Got the test program finished - <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://nocash.emubase.de/nss-test.zip">http://nocash.emubase.de/nss-test.zip</a><!-- m --> - if I got the I/O ports initialized okay, thne the test menu should show up right after just removing the BIOS from mainboard and replacing it by the test program. Though I am afraid that chances to find a NSS owner with EPROM burner are near zero - if you have that hardware, or know somebody who does, please give it a try. Screenshots/photos of the test results would be great!
<br />
<br />The test features are viewing the whole OSD charset, the OSD color attributes, X/Y display start offsets, measuring timings, testing joypad &amp; front panel inputs, dumping I/O ports, viewing INST ROM titles and checksums, and dumping outputs from the PROM chips. The latter feature should also reveal why the 5 games aren't working.
<br />
<br />My current theory is that those 5 carts don't use RP5H01 chips, but some other slightly different chips; with 2bit databus, or counter out mapped to another address line, or some other simple trivial detail... but without seeing the test results, it's beating me, I am giving up on that 5 games.</div>

						<div class="postbody">I just came across this thread... nice work!  I looked into a lot of the technical details on the NSS a couple years ago, but got sidetracked.  I wrote an app for a microcontroller to dump the security PROMs of the carts I have.  I also cut the traces to the OSD chip and programmed the microcontroller to dump the character set of the OSD chip.  I had a conversation with Kale over at the bannister.org forums, and sent him this stuff... I think they were supposed to get rolled into the MAME/MESS stuff, but I dunno whether they ever did.<br /><br />I also built an adapter to run an SNES cart on the NSS, but ran into a problem that caused DSP-1 games to have goofy Mode 7 graphics.  I hope to get back to this project one of these days.<br /><br />Anyway, I've probably forgotten half of what I knew, but from my notes, here are the keys that I dumped from Super Tennis, F-Zero, and Super Mario World.<br /><br />Super Tennis: 61ED71BD2EC5766A<br />F-Zero: 92C65FC0ADFB6FE8<br />Super Mario World: 752B1538375BB157<br /><br />I see my F-Zero is different than what you got... I watched mine on a logic analyzer as the game ran, and then verified by dumping with the MCU.  Is it possible that some other operation gets done do this data before it gets used?  Also, why are your keys 128 bits?  I'm almost certain they should be 64 bits... the RP5H01 is 64 bits, and 64 bits go on the wire (read a couple times IIRC).<br /><br />&gt;Though I am afraid that chances to find a NSS owner with EPROM burner are near zero<br />Definitely non-zero. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" />  If I get a chance, I'll try the ROM in the next couple days and let you know how it goes.<br /><br />A zip of the font is attached... there's a text and binary version.  Basically, each 2 bytes is one 12 pixel line with 4 bits of padding (because making it 12 bit aligned would be goofy).  The font is 18 pixels tall, so the first 18*2 bytes is the first character, and so on.<br /><br />DogP</div>

I'm pretty sure it was a DSP-1 problem, but I don't remember what I did to verify that.

I think I tried a different Mode 7 game (without DSP-1), and it worked, and I want to say I tried a DSP-1 game without Mode 7 and it worked.  But I could be mistaken on that.  What I do remember is that it changed depending on the cart.  I popped in an original Mario Kart, and it looked horrible, but then I loaded Mario Kart on my SNES PowerPak, and it was less bad (but still not right).<br /><br />I didn't have any other carts in the slots, but the cables on my adapter connecting the SNES cart to the NSS cart are a little bit long (6 inches, maybe), so I'm wondering if that's my problem.  Oddly, lots of other goofy games work (Star Fox, Stunt Race FX, Super Gameboy, etc).  Mega Man X2 and X3 didn't, but I think that's because there's no CIC (which IIRC, the CX4 requires).<br /><br />DogP</div>

	</div> with 16bit values in little-endian for use with no$sns... Hmmmmm. loading the font into no$sns v1.3 looks like crap :-) because of how I've been resizing it to match with the SNES screen resolution. Next version will look slightly better (with gaps between the characters). For perfect emulation one would need to resample it somehow and draw semi-transparent pixels on the font-edges, which is maybe not really worth doing it.<br /><br />Do you have more of the font screenshots, like the DSCF2842.JPG file? Would be neat to see them, too.<br /><br />EDIT: There's really no exclamation mark? The datasheet for the other chip has it at chr(3Fh) ... if you clipped the font two sets of 3 pages of 7x3 characters ... then you might have lost 3Fh (?)<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">Basically, Mario Kart and Pilot Wings both had normal looking foreground stuff, but the Mode 7 stuff was garbled.</div><br />Maybe timing problem. Some games use 2.68MHz access rate, faster ones 3.58MHz. Don't know which of the games you mentioned use which speed, but maybe they are all using the faster variant. Then replacing 74LSxxx gates by 74HCxxx might help, or using faster ROMs/EPROMs. Or maybe it's actually the cable-length, though mere 6 inches doesn't sound too long.</div>

And that means SMW should be EA8DDAEC1CA8D4AE.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">nocash wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">The NSS can toggle test mode by software. And it's reading the PROM data a couple of times, in some cases with test mode on, in other cases off. So you probably got the &quot;off&quot; case there. For F-Zero I am sure that test mode can be enabled. For Super Tennis I am not sure, maybe it's wired differently, with Test pin GNDed or so.<br />Haven't yet experimented with your Super Tennis values - but with them, I guess I'll get the game working, even if there are some odd secrets like Test pin or CounterOut pin wired to GND.</div><br />On Super Tennis, I'm fairly certain it was consistently not toggled (at least at boot, maybe I didn't check when accessing instructions), but I don't think it's grounded on the cart.  When I didn't know what the chip was, I probed it w/ the logic analyzer, and have a note that it was high when I ran it without the INST EPROM (and the game said &quot;NON SLOT&quot;).  I can check when I go to check the other stuff.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">nocash wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">Hmmmmm. loading the font into no$sns v1.3 looks like crap <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":-)" title="Smile" /> because of how I've been resizing it to match with the SNES screen resolution. Next version will look slightly better (with gaps between the characters). For perfect emulation one would need to resample it somehow and draw semi-transparent pixels on the font-edges, which is maybe not really worth doing it.</div><br />Heh, yeah... mixing analog video has a funny way of making pixel sizes not consistent. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" /><br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">nocash wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">Do you have more of the font screenshots, like the DSCF2842.JPG file? Would be neat to see them, too.<br />EDIT: There's really no exclamation mark? The datasheet for the other chip has it at chr(3Fh) ... if you clipped the font two sets of 3 pages of 7x3 characters ... then you might have lost 3Fh (?)</div><br />Yeah, all the original images are attached... there's no '!'.  I did 21 characters per screen, and on the last file, you see the font roll back over at 128.  You can see a couple characters going off the edge of the edge of the screen on a couple images... those were just left over from writes to that character position that I didn't overwrite (since I didn't care what was there, because the large scale mostly pushed them off the screen).<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">nocash wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">Maybe timing problem. Some games use 2.68MHz access rate, faster ones 3.58MHz. Don't know which of the games you mentioned use which speed, but maybe they are all using the faster variant. Then replacing 74LSxxx gates by 74HCxxx might help, or using faster ROMs/EPROMs. Or maybe it's actually the cable-length, though mere 6 inches doesn't sound too long.</div><br />I don't think it should be a speed thing though... I imagine there's more games that use the high speed than Pilotwings and Mario Kart (I have tried quite a few games, and those are the only two that I can remember failing in that way).  And I was using actual cartridges, so it shouldn't be a ROM/EPROM speed.  And about the cable length... I'm not thinking it's the actual length of the cable causing timing skew or anything... but if anything, it's either crosstalk, or added inductance caused by the 6 inches of ribbon cable.<br /><br />I have seen strange problems caused by cable length, and a lot of times I'm surprised it even works at all after looking at it on an oscope.  And I've heard of problems from people trying to make Sega Neptune-like systems (Genesis+32x, usually in a Genesis Model 2 case) that using more than a few inches of ribbon cable for the cartrdge connector will cause problems with certain games, but not others.  If I was motivated, I'd just cut these cables shorter and try it to eliminate that possibility. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" />  The only other goofy things I can remember were the CX4 games not working (assume they need a CIC), and the SuperFX chips were a little bit sensitive about the +5V (would get some glitchy lines if the +5V was &lt;4.95V).<br /><br />DogP</div>

I got the dumper code modified to dump the test bits, and redumped the PROMs.  The results are below.<br />Super Tennis: 00009F9F00009F9F 566EA374BD8EB786<br />F-Zero: 0000B7B70000B7B7 17F6DFB503FA6349<br />Super Mario World: 00007D7D00007D7D EA8DDAEC1CA8D4AE<br /><br />And yes, the counter bits do function the same between all three (my code actually already checked it, and threw an error if the count bit didn't act as expected).<br /><br />I also checked your test app... it's not watchdogging, but I didn't get a chance to connect the logic analyzer to check where it's running.  If that'd be helpful, I'll try to get to it tomorrow.<br /><br />Also, regarding the difference between the hardware of the games (cart/chips)... I don't think that's the case here.  I swapped the INST ROM, PRG ROM, and PROM between Super Mario World (ROM-A cart) and F-Zero (ROM-B cart), and they both were correctly identified, and both played without a problem (except F-Zero of course won't save anything w/o battery backed RAM).<br /><br />DogP</div>

That's what I'm using (the file is 32KB)<br />I'm not holding any buttons, though it's possible that there's an input floating<br /></div><br />Yes, 27C256, not 27C512, sorry.<br />Don't think that buttons are a problem; they are probably having pull-ups on the mainboard, so they act as not pressed. And the test program only checks joypad buttons (no special service buttons or so).<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">I forget where I found the datasheet, but it's attached to this post in case you don't already have it.<br /></div><br />Cool. I've searched everywhere and couldn't find scans. Only found 2 docs that mentioned the datasheet to exist (on paper presumably). Many thanks! Then I can remove dozens of questions marks in the fullsnes.htm specs &amp; in the OSD emulation.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">I swapped the INST ROM, PRG ROM, and PROM between Super Mario World (ROM-A cart) and F-Zero (ROM-B cart), and they both were correctly identified<br /></div><br />Good idea. Then the PROMs must be wired the same way. And CounterOut is same as normal (thanks for checking that, too). Looks more and more as if there is no special hardware, and I just made some basic mistake on the non-working games.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">Super Tennis: 00009F9F00009F9F 566EA374BD8EB786<br />F-Zero: 0000B7B70000B7B7 17F6DFB503FA6349<br />Super Mario World: 00007D7D00007D7D EA8DDAEC1CA8D4AE<br /></div><br />Thanks! Tried the Super Tennis values in my emu - didn't work - produced a checksum error right after the first decryption pass :-/<br />And here comes my stupid mistake: All working PROMs have a &quot;1&quot; in the first bit. The non-working PROMs are having a &quot;0&quot; in that place. Looking back, it's quite obvious &amp; eye-catching. I did even extract the first 8 bytes of the Contra/Robocop/SuperSoccer PROM-data from (supposed) copies in INST ROM, and they all had &quot;0&quot; as first bit, too. But I've somehow completely missed that detail :-)<br /><br />Without your help, I would have NEVER noticed it. Many-many-many thanks for the PROM dumps and confirming CounterOut and Pin-outs!!!<br /><br />And the thing that happens on &quot;0&quot; as first bit is this: The decryption code is generating a 1-to-0 CLK transition at SAME time as when releasing RESET. I suspect the PROM manufacturer would treat that as invalid/unstable operation - but it does apparently work stable: The PROM is ignoring the CLK edge in that case. Having that emulated, Super Tennis is now working fine. And the other four games will be probably working the same way, too.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">A13 and A14 are connected to VCC, so yeah... there's only 8K available.</div><br />Good to know!<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">I also checked your test app... it's not watchdogging, but I didn't get a chance to connect the logic analyzer to check where it's running. If that'd be helpful, I'll try to get to it tomorrow.<br /></div><br />Looking at the OSD SPI-bus might be good thing to start with. I've tried to program it same as in original BIOS, but maybe I missed the chipselect or something like that.<br />You can see what I am trying to do in the &quot;nss-test.a22&quot; source code file (starting with the &quot;reset_cont_d&quot; function). Some of the outcommented lines are relicts from the SFC-Box version (that's also having a OSD chip, but it's accessed differently and has nothing to do with the NSS - so just ignore the outcommented stuff).<br />I'll review the test source code against the M50458 datasheet - maybe I just didn't set an important display enable bit.</div>
