I have recently been reading alot of stuff about people taking donor carts and replacing the PRG and CHR(sometimes) chips inside with new roms. I am thinking of purchasing a willem eprom programmer (good choice? for a beginner?). I have cajoNES to seperate the files. I think i should be able to do it, but i can't find out how to know what donor carts work for each rom? Any help would be greatly appriciated <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />

<br />Buy parts from retrousb.com for MMC1 and logic mapper games, they work well and no carts are destroyed, plus no rewiring needed!
<br />
<br />If CajoNES doesn't split a file right, mail me and I'll give you my splitter program.

Also i have read about retrousb, but i would much prefer do the wiring and stuff myself using donor carts etc. I am doing this project mostly for enjoyment! thanks

<br />A good reference for this is <a href="http://bootgod.dyndns.org:7777/advanced.php" class="postlink">bootgod's database</a>. Look up the game you want to put on a cart and see what board it uses. Then make another search for that board, and all the games that use it will be listed. Some boards can be converted into different boards if they are similar enough (if they use the same mapper, for example), and some games will run on different boards without modification if their board is a subset of the other board (for example, if the only difference between two boards is the presence of SRAM, a game that doesn't use SRAM will run on both boards), but you shouldn't wory about that right now.

<br />"Mappers" is how we call the extra hardware present in the carts that is meant to expand the capabilities of the system. You see, there's an entire computer inside a video game console, but there is no software for it to run. The software is in the carts, and you have to plug them in so that the computer has a program to run. The NES was designed with certain limitations to how much memory it can see (32KB of PRG-ROM, 8KB of CHR-ROM/RAM), and the first games that were made actually respected those limitations, so their carts only conteined the memory chips wit the program and the tiles.
<br />
<br />But as time went on, games were becoming more complex, and those limitations were getting in the way. Now, you can't change how much memory the NES sees, but you can use a larger memory chip and select which part of it will be visible to the NES at any given time. This means you can have a total of, say, 128KB of PRG-ROM, but the NES will only see 32KB at a time. This works well for games, because you can have different levels, songs, etc. in different banks (as they are called) of memory.
<br />
<br />The same concept has been used to overcome the CHR limitation, and since there are a lot of signals present on the cart connector, the carts can monitor/control a lot of other aspects of the machine as well. So Nintendo and other companies started to explore this potential, and and this resulted in the creation of many mappers with different features available to the games.

<br />I have a parallel port pocket programmer I, it's amazing and does every NES you'd ever need, but it's old and USB would be a nicer one, but the ones on their site are $300 and that is a tad expensive, even to me.

<br />Like MottZilla said, watch out for the huge parallel port connector at the left side. Notice how <a href="http://www.mcumall.com/comersus/store/comersus_viewItem.asp?idProduct=4219" class="postlink">the one posted by 67726e</a> doesn't have it. That seller is probably trying to confuse buyers, because the parallel port Willem does indeed have a USB connection, but it's only used for power. All data communication goes through the parallel cable.
