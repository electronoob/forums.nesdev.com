But vice versa as well, and art direction for each console would play to its strengths.

And you have valiantly defended the NES's honor ( not that it was being attacked ) by finding an instance of each of MIM leaves in some games on the NES, and then SMS when the NES didn't quite do it. However you have missed the forest, the point is all the leaves are in MIMs forest and 25 years ago when we played it on a CRT we all said &quot;Mate your pulling my chain, you put an A600 in the case didn't you...&quot;, it doesn't look 16 bit explicitly, it feels 16 bit, the high colour, the insane full screen scroller, the full music, the moving eyes on the trees, the way he accelerates, the way he launches of the top of slopes at full speed the way he looks down and worried when he gets to the end of the platform, the way his eyes go up and then down as he jumps, the way it has more than the fixed palette of 16 colours on screen, the smoothness of his jump, and his turn around. Since then it has been determined that it would actually be mostly possible on an A500 at EAB, but it would need some compromises, to be fair to the A500, less than the NES would need <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" /><br /><br />Its a lot harder for the NES to look 16bits due to 3 crippling factors. <br />1.) Teeny tiny VBlank update, its really hard to push enough data through to add more animation, change the background etc. To make this worse you can't even access VRAM but have to spend even more time sending data through a tiny pigeon hole. <br />2.) RAM, tiny amounts of RAM, which limits the amount the game can remember or the size of the world it can update. <br />3.) 64 sprite pixels per line, flicker is decidedly cheapening and a key thing of the SNES was it got rid of most of it ( unless you were Konami ) <br /><br />I'm not saying (and have never said) that no NES game can be so high polish and update the wold and avoid sprite flicker to make you think you are playing something that is 16bit. I don't know of any examples but I didn't really own a NES, my friends had it. I started at SNES. I would imagine the NES could make a pretty decent shoot-em-up that would rival some 16bit platforms.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=8250">Oziphantom</a> — Tue Jun 12, 2018 2:11 am</p><hr />

&quot;Jupiter Scope 2: Operation Europa&quot; in one of the <em>Action 53</em> volumes has a title screen with a large title over a scrolling background, similar to <em>Mayhem</em>. It draws half the sprites in even frames and the other half in odd frames, creating a semitransparent effect. This is effective because the background is mostly dark, and it might not be quite as effective with high-contrast cartoon backgrounds like those of <em>Mayhem</em>.<br /><br />Now if horizontal sprite coverage without flicker determines what is and isn't 16-bit, Game Boy is 16-bit. It has 50% coverage with just sprites, not even counting what can be done with a &quot;window&quot; background. (See <em>Prehistorik Man</em>.)<br /><br />The Master System can change horizontal scroll in mid-draw. The NES can change both horizontal and vertical scroll in mid-draw.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=9">tepples</a> — Sun Jun 10, 2018 6:10 pm</p><hr />

<div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"><br />I can't see this being worked around practically without flickering on the NES/SMS.<br /></div><br />Indeed, that's what you have to do. My favourite examples are bubble bobble in general and the long whip in castlevania. These games rely on sprite priority cycling for their design to function interactively at all. <br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"><br />I can't imagine that they are practical from a CPU time or hardware cost<br /></div><br />I don't think CPU time or presence of IRQ:s have too much to do with it for the mentioned trick to work. If your game pak allows for chr-paging, you're ever only one write oer frame away from animating tiles, which opens up the possibility a broad selection of features. Mass scale tile animation, parallax distortion of the playfield without need for timers, or, to a very limited extent, sprite-like appearances. Cost is not much of a problem these days, either. It perfectly feasible to use 32kB:s of external RAM for graphics, which gives you more than plenty of room for these tricks. The drawback is that you have to design your stage accordingly, ie, ideally make sure that all the letters need access to the same page of scroll-triggered animation. Else you need to dynamically update the contents of the pages, which would take some cpu time. Still, some games do update the chr table continously. Solstice, for example. So it's certainly feasible for *some* game designs.<br /><br />For clarity, i'm not arguing whether a straight port of Mayhem as-is would be possible (you have to accept drawbacks). I'm just interested in what can be done, homebrew-wise.  <br /><br />If you'd make a new game with a steady title over a scrolling background, you'd need sprites to cover all edges and 8 banks of chr-rom/ram to flip between; each with a scroll-compensated tileset for the logotype itself whereas the rest is identical across all banks. Some clever shadowing using the common background splash colour would make it easier, but it's not necessary. You don't see this in old commercial games because it was a waste of expensive storage, but these days.. <br /><br />The NES PPU not being able to multiplex its sprites is a bit of a drawback, but on the other hand, 64 is quite plenty to keep track of given the available time to update the OAM and the rest each frame. I feel the number of sprites  (quite generous at the time) were a conscious design choice in regards to that the old way of doing it (multiplexing) wasn't on the table.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=7508">FrankenGraphics</a> — Sun Jun 10, 2018 3:36 pm</p><hr />

Again, while I accept that these approaches are possible, I can't imagine that they are practical from a CPU time or hardware cost (probably more CPU than anything, especially on NTSC).<br /><br />Thing is, if the C64 had the same sprite size limitations as the NES, Mayhem probably wouldn't have scrolling background behind the status bar.  I'd just set a raster IRQ to go off just above it and reset X scroll to zero.  Seeing that Mayhem uses a VSP type scroller, I may have to store the status area in a different video bank, but that's no real inconvenience.<br /><br />The stock NES doesn't have a <em>real</em> programmable raster IRQ generator, but the SMS does.  I don't know if it can change scroll positions outside of VBLANK though.<br /><br />Anyways, all of this only addresses the status bar, of which the top half is actually made from X-expanded sprites, meaning there are still enough sprite pixels for Mayhem himself (with overly) and a couple of enemies.  Speaking of sprite pixel counts, the NES has a total of 8192 hardware sprite pixels (8x16x64) per frame, not counting the 64 pixel per line limit.  The C64 has 4032 (24x21x8), but these can easily multiplexed in software.  I've heard some games manage 24 sprites... that's 12096 pixels!  <a href="https://youtu.be/ldo2ewLBt3Y?t=42m54s" class="postlink">Here's</a> some more of them being put to use.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3210">Hojo_Norem</a> — Sun Jun 10, 2018 2:40 pm</p><hr />
