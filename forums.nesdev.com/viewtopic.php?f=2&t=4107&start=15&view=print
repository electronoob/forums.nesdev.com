<br />I'm still laughing from the time he wanted to port SMB to the b&amp;w Gameboy!
<br />
<br />Is it only me, or did he not come up with these threads until after Doppleganger released his reverse-engineered SMB source?

You just have to focus on that ONE thing that's important to you at the moment, and then, if you keep interested, *maybe* you'll be able to finish it.

You'd have to have a very good understanding of both systems and spend alot of time rewriting alot of code. Maybe you're right that he enjoys coming up with grand ideas like these. It is fun to dream afterall. The problem comes when he wants others to realize them for him or under estimating just how tough something will be.

In order to do what you have in mind, you would need to make an attribute look-up table similar to the metatile graphics table (because of metatile number skipping), but with one entry instead of four.  You then have to modify the attribute table rendering code in order for this look-up table to have any effect.<br /><br />It goes without saying that you need space to put all of this stuff.

<br />
<br />I can use part of the SMB-Special NES port source code (The one in the RHDN Forums) and put the sound in another bank (Bankswitching), Use the leftover space for that. Maybe port it to Sunsoft FME/Mapper 69 (The most succesful mapper I ported SMB on).
<br />
<br />Note that I can have more extra space in INES mapper 69 (Sunsoft FME7), It has a optional RAM/ROM bank in 6000-7FFF. But IRQs are disabled for the moment
<br />
<br />PS: Unrom requires CHR-RAM, I am not there yet. as I am not doing that right now.
<br />
<br />PS2: I might try and create a fake UNROM-compatible mapper to handle PRG-ROM in 6000-7FFF. But I need to find a Very Lightweight/Small C(++) Compiler instead of MS Visual C(++) to compile a mapper (I might use NESTEN or GNES).
<br />
<br />PS3: I wish there was a FREEBASIC NES emulator.

<br />Well, It is technically possible to modify a cartridge to do it like that.

<br />Man, if you are worried about something as simple as copying 8KB of data to VRAM just once (since SMB originally uses only 8KB of CHR-ROM, you don't need any sort of CHR manipulation afterwards), you really shouldn't be trying the rest of this stuff!

<br />
<br />Until such a cartridge physically exists, you should not create a mapper number for it.  It's hard enough for emulators to stay on top of mappers that actually exist -- fabricating "theoretical" mappers only makes things worse for everyone.
<br />
<br />At any rate, I would say this isn't something worth doing for a ROM-hack.  Just use an existing mapper.
