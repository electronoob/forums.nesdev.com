		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Hi.
<br />So, I'm developing new game.I have scrolling engine almost done, it can scroll in two ways(right and left).Everything nice and blah, blah, blah...
<br />But in my game I want to make only 1 way scroll.Like SMB, only scroll in right.There's no technical problems.I just wonder if making a <span style="text-decoration: underline">platform</span> game that scrolls in 1 way only is a shame? What do you, guys, think about games like that? Any thoughts?

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />It depends on a lot of things.  If it's a game like Adventure Island where the goal is to move forward at a breakneck pace, then it's no problem.  It's not a problem in a scrolling space shooter, or otherwise auto-scrolling levels.
<br />
<br />If it's exactly like SMB, that might annoy some people, but if your game is properly designed around that limitation then it shouldn't be a problem.  It might be looked down upon by some nesdev developers for not using the most advanced coding techniques to get around limitations like this, but guess what?  You're doing this to make the kind of game you want to make, and if you succeed then you'll have made more progress than a lot of the people here!
<br />
<br />So do whatever you feel like. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />

<br />Chip &amp; Dale Rescue Rangers is awesome, by the way. One of the few Disney games I've owned in my lifetime (apart from Kingdom Hearts, but KH just isn't as fun as Rescue Rangers). <img src="./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" />

<br />
<br />I personally prefer games where you can explore the level, go back and forth looking for things, rather than follow a straight line until the end, but both kinds can be fun if done right.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />It's one of those things where you ask yourself, given the choice of going backwards, do I really go backwards that often?  Depends on the game, of course.
<br />
<br />A lot of Kirby's Adventure levels are quite linear and wouldn't suffer much from not being able to backtrack.  In fact there are points in most levels where you actually can't backtrack, due to a star that warped you to your current screen, etc.
<br />
<br />Now, some Kirby levels are maze-like and let you go all over the place looking for the exit, and that's fun too, but if those levels hadn't been present I don't think making it a one way game would've caused much uproar.

<br />
<br />Now if there is any good reason to not allow backtracking exept your own laziness, then I'm all fine with it. But if there is no reason, I guess it's best to implement it.
