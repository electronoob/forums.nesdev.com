		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />It's probably accurate, compared to say MAME, but like most emulators, I assume it abstracts a lot of the VDP hardware. People may confuse this for absolute accuracy since a full implementation is not necessary for the vast majority of games, if any. To my knowledge nobody has sat down with a logic analyzer and tried to figure out what it's doing each cycle. Few people may have brought the LA/electron microscope to NES (there are still final frontiers), but the necessity of developing/emulating raster effects and cartridge hardware has brought out a lot of ingenuity from hackers here and NES emulation has set a precedent in accuracy that emulators for other consoles likely CAN'T follow.

If that weren't enough, I happened to notice this comment (that given the code looks current) which I'm sure he can understand, and I quote: <div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">// Do one line's worth of DMA transfers<br />					// because Cosmic Fantasy 4 is evil<br />					// and uses timed writes to the DMA<br />					// start register, rather than waiting until<br />					// the machine says we're done,<br />					// which would require cycle-accurate VDC emulation...like that's<br />					// going to happen when I don't even have accurate values<br />					// for HuC6280 instruction timings. :b</div>So tell him he's an idiot ;)

<br />
<br />BTW: I was under the impression that Ootake was the most compatible PCE emulator, so I looked at its source (over 3500 lines...) and it appears to emulate on a somewhat educated line level, pretty much the norm for "accurate" console emulators, but still extremely far from Nintendulator.

<br />They we're talking about the NES emulator part of Mednafen... not PCE.
