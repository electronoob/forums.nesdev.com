		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I think any NES tutorial is good for nesicide, asm6 or ca65. At least for me, translating the excercises from nesasm3 to asm6 helped me understand better what was going on and what it was to assemble a program. I should add that before 6502 assembly, my prior programming experience was *very* limited. Just BASIC and various small scripts, essentially. So i don't think it's too rough to try to make his example code work with another example, even if it is *slightly* more uphill. <br /><br />If you're going for asm6, you'll find everything you need in the short readme file that comes included to be able to translate the tutorial as an excersise in-itself.<br /><br />If you're going for ca65 or NESICIDE (which as others have pointed out is built on ca65), the example rainwarrior posted plus the (very large) reference guide of the cc suite will help you achieve the same. Link to the ca65 chapter here: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://cc65.github.io/doc/ca65.html">https://cc65.github.io/doc/ca65.html</a><!-- m --><br /><br />I've read it over and over and still have a lot to learn. Only a fraction of what is described in the reference is required to build a simple program. it's just a very versatile assembler that offers a lot of extra functionality beside the basics. Some of it is only relevant to other systems than the NES, so you can safely skip those parts for now.

When starting out, we often don't know what tools do what and how, so it's very hard to make substitutions on our own. Once you're more acquainted with how things work and how everything is put together, you can try other tools if you think any of the ones you're using aren't as good as they could be.

They show each instruction and its bytes and cycles used, among other things.  I don't remember the pdf's name, but you can find it easily with a duckduckgo.com search. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />  (I printed the appendicies out for easy searching, but there are other webpages with the info too.)  The NES' 2A03 is a special type of 6502 processor.<br /><br />edit: <a href="http://www.6502.org/documents/books/mcs6500_family_programming_manual.pdf" class="postlink">msc6500_family_programming_manual.pdf</a> that's a later edition than the 1st edition appendicies I printed out a long time ago, but this edition's appendicies are more correct and understandable. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />  <span style="font-size: 85%; line-height: normal">Small tip: print this pdf's page 198 in landscape mode.</span></div><br /><br />Thanks for PDF! <br /><br />But this is what I don't understand.<br /><br />Is it a separate engine, like the Address? Or is it a form of abilities like RAM or DATA styles?<br /><br />Like how does the register of A X Y [and P Z ] works? Or they work as a special form of variables like, a temporary placement of &quot; A = X + Y&quot; until the new replacement happens like &quot;STA&quot; or &quot;LDA&quot;? <br />I don't like to say this much, but can you explain like if I'm in Elementary School to help me understand about register?  [It's very owned variables, like no other regular variables can use?]<br /><br />Or it's like a &quot;magic effects&quot; but in programming, like the A represent the stages of Mario Bros. your in, X represent your health, and Y represent your Mario life?
