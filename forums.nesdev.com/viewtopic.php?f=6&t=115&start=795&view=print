<br />
<br />That has Adventures of Rad Gravity. The original source was a site Memblers made, but since that's not up, just check in 'A' in the above package.
<br />
<br />As for fixing Yo Noid....I do believe that I've come to the conclusion that all the Winamp players I've tried to fix are far beyond my knowledge as a mere NSF ripper. I can extract the data, but I can't make it play right in the existing players, so it's counter-productive to spend time fixing something that I can hardly tell whether or not I've really fixed. I'm still working on a GBS format update as well, so it's not like I'm just quitting, but I am reallocating my time to something I might have some chance of improving to some degree still.
<br />
<br />Hopefully, I'm not the only one still sitting around ripping NSFs, and someone else will be able to help you until I've regained the mental stamina needed to go on another spree of multi-format activity. I just never know when I'll hit a pit in my concentration levels.

<br />I managed to rip the following games.
<br />
<br />Earth Worm Jim 2 (Pirate Original)
<br />Lion King
<br />Lion King, The (Mapper 4) (L-N1 or I or L) 
<br />Mach Rider (VS)
<br />Ms. Pac-Man (Namco)
<br />Pac-Land 
<br />Tiny Toons Cartoon Workshop
<br />
<br />The following have already been ripped.
<br />
<br />Karaoke Studio Senyou Cassette Vol 2 (J)
<br />Pinball VS
<br />
<br />
<br />This one here is debatable. As there is a (J) version of the game. I don't have the (unl) version.
<br />
<br />Pizza Pop Mario (Unl)
<br />
<br />I may rip this one later just to find out if the music driver is any different in the other versions.
<br />
<br />Mickey Mouse Dream Balloon (U) (Prototype)
<br />
<br />Donkey Kong Classics 
<br />Mario Bros Classic (E) - This one is PAL version and a possibility of having additional tunes. I am going to check both of these out later.
<br />
<br />
<br />Dian Shi Ma Li (Chinese Mario Lottery) - Not much music in this one.
<br />Game Genie bios - just bleeps as far as I know.
<br />
<br />I will upload the ones that I've ripped in a few days, as well as a few others that I have ripped.

<br />
<br />I've been listening to tune 6 which is the very last tune in the rip. Yeah, over-all the tune is a bit fast. But is this the way it plays in the game? I've been playing the game and haven't run into the tune yet to know for a fact what the true speed is in the game.
