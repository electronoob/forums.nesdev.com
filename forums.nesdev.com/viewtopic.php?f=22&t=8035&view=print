<br />Music isn't very good either.  I've heard much better songs posted on the Famitracker message boards.
<br />It's possible to refresh an entire NES screen in 4 frames with no flickering and no jumping by using a decent unrolled PPU copy loop, but this demo is just made of fail.
<br />Too bad the author intentionally made it this way, he can do much better than this.

<br />That's what I thought at first, but after seeing how the program behaves differently across emulators and an actual console, I'm pretty sure this was just badly coded.
<br />
<br />I mean, even if you want a program to LOOK glitchy, you should simulate all the effects intentionally rather than actually run garbage code, because you never know what kind of unpleasant and inconsistent side effects glitchy code can produce.

<br />
<br />I don't agree. Write code for the real machine, not emulators. As long as you're using predictable behavior of the real hardware you're in the right.

<br />
<br />I think it may be because of 2007 writes and the console is probably being forgiving, just look at it in PAL and then to NTSC mode, it has to be using too much VBlank for stuff as it is just wonky in both, but less in PAL.

<br />And I really don't agree with that. Although I don't think we should accommodate known emulator inaccuracies, we should code "safely". Unless it's doing something really "edgy" (which this program in particular doesn't appear to be), I see no reason for a program not to work the same across different emulators and consoles. The fact that it doesn't work well on emulators should serve as a warning.
<br />
<br />As long as you respect the basic timing, set the scroll correctly, initialize all variables and registers, the program should work everywhere. If a program works on hardware but not on emulators and is not doing anything "edgy" (forced blanking, mid-screen PPU changes, etc), I'd say there's something wrong with it. You might have made a mistake somewhere but the program runs on hardware by pure luck, something you shouldn't rely on.
<br />
<br />Coding safely is pretty much the same as driving safely to me. If you drive safely you'll probably be OK on most roads. If you are reckless you might even get away with it if you are lucky, but it's very likely you'll eventually cause an accident.
<br />
<br />However, if the program is using "unconventional" tricks, then the hardware obviously has the final word.

<br />
<br />Two bit's and the LDA $4015 LDA #$FF 2 lines later is just....I dunno.
<br />
<br />And if you watch the nametable viewer in FCEUX, it seems to me like it just write the whole screen to it at once, which cause the junk at the top, and then just gets more corrupted. And it's scrolling jumps everywhere, too. And it puts blocks on the other nametables too. Why would it do that if they're never seen. It's 100% bad programming...that's about it.
