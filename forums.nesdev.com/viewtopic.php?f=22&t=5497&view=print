<br />Hope the link works okay.  Have fun, folks.  You can check out the first area and first boss.  The game will reset after beating the boss.
<br />
<br />I also am aware of the game over screen not showing passwords or allowing you to pick end.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />The game is very nice, congratulations! I suck too much at this kind of game (and in most others, to tell the truth), and barely managed to get to the boss. There is no way I'm killing it! =)
<br />
<br />Sometimes it felt like the traps were a bit too cheap, so I used an occasional save state or I'd end up kicking my PC, but I guess this is just me. The challenge level is probably good for most players, who are usually more skilled than I am.
<br />
<br />Something that bothered me a little was the quick switching of screens when I accidentally went past the top of the screen when jumping, or when I was trying to see where I could land on the next screen up. That made me somewhat dizzy for some reason, but again, maybe this is just me.
<br />
<br />I'm quite impressed. The graphics are simple but extremely well done, the physics is easy to get used to, and the music is also nice. It was fun to play the first level. Congratulations again! I hope you can inspire people here to finish their projects as well (including me!).

<br />
<br />However, collision detection seemed a bit on the unforgiving side. I took a few screenshots in FCEU:
<br /><ul><a href="http://morphcat.de/crap/BattleKid-Demo-0.png" class="postlink">I kept dying while trying to jump over this enemy</a><br /><a href="http://morphcat.de/crap/BattleKid-Demo-1.png" class="postlink">fitting through this gap usually took a few tries as well</a><br /><a href="http://morphcat.de/crap/BattleKid-Demo-2.png" class="postlink">had to be really careful when jumping over this death tile</a> (fixed the link, thanks Sivak)</ul>
<br />In all of these cases my instincts were clearly saying: "It should work, you won't die!"

<br />I like the challenge. If you get continue points and passwords every few screens it seems alright to me... Not any harder than some of the classics games.
<br />It's probably not a game you will finish in one sitting the first time you play it, but the graphics, music and gameplay will make you pick it up again. At least that's how I see it.
<br />However, if the other levels and bosses get much harder, I might destroy a few nes controllers in the process of beating the game. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" />

<br />
<br />Well, you do indeed get the continue rooms around every 9-12 screens.  It obviously varies...  But I believe they are spaced out fairly.  Passwords are available for Easy and Normal difficulties.
<br />
<br />The easy difficulty gives you the damage amp item, which doubles your attack power.  Really helps with bosses.  You can find this item on other difficulties as well, though.

<br />I disagreee. A lot of classic games are hard but I can't remember any classics game where I couldn't beat the stage 1 without savestates, let alone the first part of stage 1. If you consider Ghost &amp; Goblins an classic then threre is one expetion.
<br />A good game should have a learning curve in my opinion. Altough I couldn't care less cause it's not my game.

<br />It is a classic, but it's an arcade game, and those have to be hard in order to get money out of the kiddies.
<br />
<br />About games like Sivak's, I just don't have the patience to go through all these rooms in order to get to a particular room that's giving me problems so that I can test all possible ways to get through it. Going through the same rooms over and over again really gets on my nerves, even though I know this is probably how you master going through them. I don't like large doses of repetition, so it was pretty entertaining once I started using save states for certain rooms.

<br />But if the kiddies are shunning a game for being too difficult, the administrator needs to flip DIP switches to make it easier. For example, Qix lets the administrator change the minimum fenced-off area to clear a field, and Dance Dance Revolution games let the administrator change the rate at which "miss" judgments deplete health.

<br />Uh, nah.  I already have the items made.  They are:
<br />High Jump:  It is what it says
<br />Feather fall:  Hold up to drop slower
<br />Infinite O2:  Breathe underwater forever
<br />Double jump:  Self-explained
<br />One hidden item:  Hm hm hm?  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_cool.gif" alt="8)" title="Cool" />
<br />
<br />There are also keys which are item pickups and they let you destroy the numbered blocks.  A few #1 blocks are seen in the demo.
