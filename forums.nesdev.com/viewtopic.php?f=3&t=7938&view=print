<br />
<br />It is not bogus.
<br />
<br />Sprite evaluation is a 2 step process.  Sprites are first evaluated,  then loaded, then displayed.
<br />
<br />Evaluation of the NEXT scanline's sprites are occuring while the sprites evaluated last scanline are being displayed.  After evaluation, sprite data is fetched near the end of the scanline in Hblank, which will then be shown on the next scanline.  This pipelining is required since rendering cannot be stopped to fetch sprites.

<br />Exactly. If the sprite rendering process really starts in the pre-render scanline, <strong>the NEXT scanline is the first rendered one</strong>, but it doesn't have any sprites. What's the point of doing the whole sprite evaluation process and pattern fetching during the pre-render scanline if the NEXT scanline doesn't have sprites at all?

Dummy reads or not, the <strong>purpose</strong> of the pre-render scanline can't be to get the sprite system going, since no sprites are displayed in the next scanline. To me it really seems like the purpose is to get the background rendering started, since the first couple of background patterns are fetched at the end of the previous scanline.

Although, if you think about that, that'd mean it'd fetch all sprites of $FF, which would put a line at the top of the screen of sprites, and then block out all on the top. So that right there makes it say it just doesn't fetch sprites.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I'm actually contesting 2 things here:
<br />
<br /><strong>1. What the PPU actually does during the pre-render scanline;</strong>
<br />
<br />It may very well be performing the sprite logic, but since it's impossible to put sprites at coordinate -1 they will never show up in the first rendered scanline. This makes me wonder though, why didn't they look for sprites at Y coordinate 0 during scanline -1 so that the Y coordinates of the sprites would match the screen coordinates rather than be off by 1?
<br />
<br /><strong>2. The fact that lots of documents say the purpose of the pre-render scanline is to kickstart the sprite rendering system;</strong>
<br />
<br />Since no sprites are displayed in the first rendered scanline, this can't possibly be the purpose of the pre-render scanline. I'm not saying the documents are wrong about what they say the PPU does during that time (as I can't possibly verify that myself), but that they are wrong about <strong>why</strong> the PPU does it.

The NES PPU was Nintendo's first attempt at making a TMS9918-style VDP after someone in Nintendo saw the promise of the ColecoVision. (See <a href="http://nesdev.com/bbs/viewtopic.php?t=5039" class="postlink">topic 5039</a>.) As I understand it, the video circuit in most arcade games of the time, such as the Radar Scope board that the Donkey Kong games ran on, tended to have only enough OAM entries for one scanline.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"><strong>2.
