This is because of reset line glitching, and on DMG to a lesser degree bus possibly glitching since the work RAM is on the same bus as the cartridge. You can cut the reset line inside the Gameboy, or on the cartridge, but some cartridges rely on the reset line to be pulled high for their operation, so you may want to fix this somehow. I've solved this by using a broken Mega Memory in passthrough mode as an adapter, where I disconnect the reset lines, and pull the second cart slot's reset line high.<br /><br />One of those projects that I want to do, but may never finish, is a universal cart swapping dumper/flasher. So this thing would copy itself to RAM, and then you would swap the cartridge, and then you can dump ROM or SRAM data in various ways. This could include link port, audio (which would be decoded by an application on the PC) or for smaller amounts of data, work RAM.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=4548">nitro2k01</a> — Thu Jan 02, 2014 7:48 pm</p><hr />

Sorry for the long reply, but yeah, I guess I'll just wait until I can find a Mega Memory Card.<br />For now, taking pictures of the Gameboy screen works fine. Good thing my GBA SP Screen isn't very scratched!<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=6306">RollRoundInTheToilet</a> — Mon Dec 30, 2013 10:30 pm</p><hr />

The objective is just to take pictures with the gameboy camera and use them on your computer, right?<br /><br />It looks like Frohwein's emulator doesn't actually have any save memory, which explains why you can't get the images off it.<br /><br />The <a href="http://www.mikrocontroller.net/attachment/34801/gb-printer.txt" class="postlink">documentation</a> for the gameboy printer's protocol is complete enough that building a device that translated the printer's GB SPI protocol to serial or USB should be a nice project.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3512">lidnariq</a> — Fri Dec 20, 2013 2:08 pm</p><hr />

I don't have any experience with the EMS cards or the GBP emulator, but I can tell you that a USB-Parallel adapter will not work.  They don't actually emulate the full parallel port functionality, only LPT printers.  Personally, I'd keep hunting around for a MMC, they're really handy to have, for more than just what you're doing.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=5348">qwertymodo</a> — Fri Dec 20, 2013 11:16 am</p><hr />

I recently bought an EMS 64m SmartCard (Rolls right off the tongue, doesn't it?) and a Gameboy Camera, and I'm finding it hard to find a Mega Memory card online - at least one that fits into my low budget... But then I found a <a href="http://www.freeroms.com/roms/gameboy_color/gameboy_printer_emulator_v1_0_by_jeff_frohwein_public_domain.htm" class="postlink">homebrew ROM</a> on Google that emulates a Gameboy Printer. When I flashed it to the card and tried it out it seemed to save the images to the SRAM, but the <a href="http://drx.a-blast.org/~drx/projects/gameboy/howto/index.en.html" class="postlink">sav image dumping program</a> didn't seem to recognize it - evidently it only works with Gameboy Camera saves. I read in another thread somewhere that someone had used a Gameboy Camera ROM on a different flash card - but just as I feared it didn't work on the 64m.<br /><br />Does anyone around here know if something like this can be done successfully?<br /><br />Can the Gameboy Camera ROM be patched somehow to work on the card or can the ROM I found be used with a tool to extract the images?<br /><br />Or am I going to have to track down a Madcatz link... and if so will a parallel to USB adapter work?<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=6306">RollRoundInTheToilet</a> — Tue Dec 17, 2013 11:21 am</p><hr />
