<br />
<br />
<br />Hope that helps. I'm sure the hardware gods will come in here soon to help.  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=":wink:" title="Wink" />

<br />
<br />Yes, they do show up.  On the HardNES player I made ages ago, I mapped RAM under 4xxxh so that I could read back what was written to the registers.  This worked fine. 
<br />
<br />The only caveat is on readback registers (4015) you will get the bits from 4015 instead of from the outside world.  For the unimplemented bits of 4015 I am not sure what happens.  They either come from the outside world or are set to a default level (0 or thereabouts).  
<br />
<br />Also it was brought up that 4018, 4019, and 401a are actually readable too and return the square volume and/or DPCM level somehow but I am not sure if it works.  Q messaged me on IRC one day and said he thinks after studying the chips that this might happen.  
<br />
<br />Unfortunately my copyNES doesn't work any more due to a parallel port problem after I replaced the mobo on PC #2 so I have not checked yet.

<br />If $4015 is anything like $4016 and $4017 (and it might not be because those are the outside world), you get open bus on the unimplemented bits, which means the outside world comes through. I can't test this myself because open bus behaves differently with a PowerPak.

<br />
<br />Yeah, 4016 and 4017 are different.  They are external to the chip.  4015 is the only (known) register that is generated internally... unless 4018-401a allow reading.  Those two 74HC368's on the NES board are what are used when 4016 and 4017 are read.  There's two output signals that drive them from the CPU.
