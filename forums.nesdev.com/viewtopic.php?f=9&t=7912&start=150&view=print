<br />
<br />The new client is easy use than old~
<br />
<br />The most important is U can get more quickly technical support!
<br />and grant update request about the program!
<br />
<br />By the way ,I'll write the english doc for the script's readme.

<br />
<br />I downloaded the "kazzo_0.1.2.zip", unzipped it, opened the windows driver folder, right-clicked kazzo.inf, and chose "Install". Then I downloaded anago from <a href="http://sourceforge.jp/projects/unagi/releases/49771" class="postlink">here</a> and tried to dump an MMC1 cartridge with anago_wx, and all I got was "reader open error".
<br />
<br />What should I try next? Do I need to restart my PC before installing kazzo.inf and using anago_wx?
<br />
<br />
<br />EDIT: Problem solved. I restarted the PC, and then chose the driver folder in the Found New Hardware Wizard, and it worked.

<br />
<br />I also didn't have to install the drivers to get it working on my windows XP machine.  I just plugged it in and ran anago.exe from the command line for pretty much everything I've done with it.  I only had to install the drivers with my win7 machine, but I still can't get consistently good dumps with it.  But OldNESJunkie didn't have any issues on win7.
<br />
<br />Don't forget you need to keep the bootloader switch up in the "normal" position when you plug it in.  Then immediately after you plug it in you can take the bootloader switch down to BL, because of that PCB/firmware bug.  
<br />
<br />In regards to that bug I was able to recompile the firmware to remove the high current condition.  But all the dumps ended up bad, something wrong with mirror sensing I think.  I've had a lot of difficultly modifying all the code so I kinda just set it aside.  I think the best fix right now is de-soldering the Vcc lead off the BL switch.  If you want to shoot yours back my way I can take care of that for you, or anyone else for that matter.

<br />
<br />Make sure you copied over the nrom.ad NOT nrom.af  (ad is for dumping af is for flashing)
<br />
<br />Otherwise it's possible that you're running on a different version of the firmware than last time.  Try going back to the version of the software from early in the summer, there was a release around mid summer that could be causing some issues.

<br />
<br />If you get down and dirty with the dumping scripts it should be possible.  I actually use the command line more than the gui especially if you're playing around with the dumping scripts.  The MMC3 portion is already done, you would just need to port over what they did with the tapedump for switching game banks.
<br />
<br />I really like the hardware of the kazzo, but I had a hard time with the software and firmware.  I don't know if it's just because of my skills or lack of commenting in the code though.   I'm going to be using the hardware and completely different set of firmware and software for some of the prototyping work with the NESDEV1 cart.  My goal is to make it much less abstracted than the kazzo software/firmware.   So changes would actually be made at the code level, and have abilities to toggle pins and everything directly.  Not sure if it would be helpful for others but it allows me to do what I'd like with the hardware which is more cartridge interfacing than dumping obscure carts.

<br />I gave the board files to you back on page 7 of this thread if you want em again.
<br />
<br />If you go back to the beginning of the thread you can see how I made my first one on protoboard with connecting wire.  If you're making it from scratch at home that's really the only reasonable method.  Unless you make it on some hugely oversized double sided PCB and were really good at etching <img src="./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" />
