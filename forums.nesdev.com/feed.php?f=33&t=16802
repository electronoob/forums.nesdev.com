Using the a53 mapper directly would allow instant CNROM-like CHR switching with more PRG, yes.<br /><br />However, I'm not going to spend a lot of time on this, which rules out any mapper changes and the like. It's full, PRG almost to the last byte (it was full to the last byte before the vsync optimization saved some...). Lowering the difficulty curve might be possible, when I have time later.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=7237">calima</a> — Mon Mar 19, 2018 2:59 am</p><hr />

Perhaps compression is assumed necessary because the next binary step up from 64 KiB (entry size limit) is 128 KiB. If only a few more kilobytes are needed to turn the tech demo into a finished game, the rest is wasted unless it's used (say) to soak up other games' compressed CHR data.<br /><br />But you still have 32 KiB of CHR RAM. If the CHR data compresses from 32 KiB to (say) 22 KiB, you can decompress all the CHR data into RAM at the start and then use the extra 10 KiB for self-contained or less frequently accessed things, such as the music engine.<br /><br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">A53_REG        = $5000<br />A53_CHRBANK    = $00<br />A53_PRGBANK    = $01<br />A53_MODE       = $80<br />A53_OUTERBANK  = $81<br />A53_VALUE      = $8000<br /><br />MMC1MIRROR_V   = $02<br />MMC1MIRROR_H   = $03<br />MMC1PRG_32K    = $00<br />MMC1PRG_FIX80  = $08<br />MMC1PRG_FIXC0  = $0C<br />A53PRG_256KBIT = $00<br />A53PRG_512KBIT = $10<br />A53PRG_1MBIT   = $20<br />A53PRG_2MBIT   = $30<br /><br />a53_init:<br />  ldy #A53_OUTERBANK<br />  sty A53_REG    ; reg $81: outer bank<br />  lda #$FF<br />  sta A53_VALUE  ; needed for standalone A53 use, patched to BIT in multicart<br />  dey<br />  sty A53_REG    ; reg $80: mode (similar to MMC1)<br />  lda #A53PRG_512KBIT|MMC1PRG_FIXC0|MMC1MIRROR_V<br />  sta A53_VALUE<br />  rts<br /><br />set_chr_bank_y:<br />  lda #$00<br />  sta A53_REG<br />  sty A53_VALUE<br />  rts<br /><br />set_prg_bank_y:<br />  lda #$01<br />  sta A53_REG<br />  sty A53_VALUE<br />  rts<br /></div><p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=9">tepples</a> — Sun Mar 18, 2018 1:26 pm</p><hr />

Any improvements based on feedback from the compo are more than welcome.  We're all for making the cartridge better.

Last year I think we requested people have their roms ready for publishing by the end of March, results were a little delayed this year so maybe the better rule is 1 month after results are posted (mid-April).  That way Tepples can start finalizing the rom, we have a general idea of what all games will be on the cart so we can start the artwork process.  Beyond that, for the entrants it's time to start thinking about next year's compo.  <br /><br />If you have significant improvements/expansion you'd like to apply to an entry it's more than welcome for submission in a future compo as well.  <br /><br />Since the compo is over now, the idea of changing categories post compo doesn't really apply so long as we can still get it in the cart.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=4832">infiniteneslives</a> — Sun Mar 18, 2018 12:22 pm</p><hr />

Unless the abundance of CNROM projects this year permits significant compression, it doesn't look like we'll easily fit in 512KB for all entries.  The raw total is around 750KByte.

I basically agree on all design points made by m-tee.<br /><br />Ultimately i think a dungeon crawler /maze rpg is pretty challenging to pull off on CNROM as it is dependent on a lot of data tables, but what we have here is three subgames competing for that same prg space:<br /><br />-realtime 3d game<br />-crawling rpg with stats, a basic level system, treasure hunt &amp; monster fights<br />-clipdoll dressing game (try on different equipment, see them displayed in battles, and discover useful combos. Not unlike Diablo in that sense)<br /><br />the third didn't exactly compete as most of that is chr data which there was plenty of, but also some space-related choices made this subgame largely unavailable to the player (ie need to hurry through the labyrinth because of timer based difficulty, no stash/store, limited space for all the data needed to fully realize it). <br /><br />if ROM size would be brought up to the scope of the design, i think it has a really good potential. As it stands it is kind of more of a technical demonstration. <br /><br />For cart inclusion, i think it'd make sense to nerf all enemies or buff the player in whatever way possible since the difficulty makes it forbidding, which counteracts the demonstration. I don't think we can achieve good balance as-is, but it could be made easier to experience. Maybe simply the player base stats could be brought higher to give a headstart.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=7508">FrankenGraphics</a> — Sun Mar 18, 2018 4:04 am</p><hr />

I would love to see what the game could look like if the exploration mode were more visually in-line with the combat and title screens.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the difficulty curve was just too steep for me to justify playing any further (also there were some strong nametable errors while playing on an Everdrive and a Famicom.) Moreover, the size of the blue bar that represents items changing based on distance could help with visual orientation a whole lot. <br /><br />The decision to increase difficulty for longer wait times seems... unusual, at best? It seems like all it does is punish less experienced players and/or exploration (which seems like it'd be the personal objective of most players - even if exiting the maze is the official objective) Moreover, why not communicate this information to the player? (This could be done with as little as some text about increased danger at night and palette changes while in map view to indicate time of day).<br /><br />Ultimately, it was an ambitious title, and I respect that. In the end though, it felt like two partially complete ideas put together and not a cohesive product. Although its difficulty curve and aesthetic inconsistency definitely held back my enjoyment of the title, I'm curious as to see what it might grow into (or what else could be done with the first person mode).<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=5942">M_Tee</a> — Sun Mar 18, 2018 12:09 am</p><hr />

There are quite some quite rough cuts. <br /><br />Tips on playing: Go fast, try not to wait around too much. There's a timer increasing the difficulty. What i usually do is get all the gear on the lower end of the map as quick as possible, then dash for the exit. If i happen upon an enemy that is too good for my current gear, i just run. HP is restored between fights so potions are only needed in battle emergencies. <br /><br />It's admittedly a too hard for me as well, but that has got me to the end at least once. Only way i know of is to just dash to chests i know about from failed attempts. Now that i know where the exit is, that might be a strategy too, haha.<br /><br />edit: calima beat me to most points. yeah, timing defense and attacks is really important too, at least in fights you have a good chance of winning.<br /><br />edit2: now that the judging is over, here's some still states from the missing boss fight. The player would've stood on a sprite based platform while the bg was split to scroll along with the minotaurs' fints and punches.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=7508">FrankenGraphics</a> — Wed Mar 14, 2018 1:19 pm</p><hr />
