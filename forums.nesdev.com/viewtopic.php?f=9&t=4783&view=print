<br />
<br />Note, however, that a 2764 is only 64kilobit, or 8kilobyte: It would take 3 or 5 to support the tiniest of NES games. They would be far more practical for making Atari 2600 repros.

I've noticed that when using non-CMOS EPROMs in NES games, they tend to get kinda warm.
<br />
<br />Also, as lidnariq pointed out, 2764's are only 8k, so aren't a whole lot of use for NES games - but I use them all the time in Atari 2600 carts though.

<br />
<br />thanks, Tepples. you always seem to have the straight answer that I'm looking for. they're PERFECT for an 8KB CHR bank, as long as they're the right size and pinout...does the different response time mean i might get graphical glitches?
<br />
<br />also, is it possible to use a 8KB or smaller ROM as a PRG? iirc, all that's necessary is to tie certain address pins high or low, ok i forget.
<br />
<br />pps...power consumption... not a problem on the NES, right?

<br />
<br />You can, but there are no commercial games that will fit -- the smallest is 16kB. You'll need to use two and some external logic. Address lines generally do not need to be tied high or low if the ROM is smaller than the space you're mapping it into.

<br />
<br />ok but i'm not planning to reproduce commercial games, this is for demos and test ROMs only (artROMs too)

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Yeah, you can fit a decent amount of stuff in 8kB.  Not a lot, but hey.  Bigger roms are only like $1, so it's not a huge money saver really.  Unless your program really doesn't need to be bigger.  (and you can't really buy 8kB EPROMs anymore, not cheap new ones anyways).
<br />
<br />IIRC, the game Galaxian used 8kB for both PRG and CHR.

<br />Thank you, RetroHacker, for that important detail. Definitely essential information.

<br />
<br />Yes, your programmer needs to know exactly what chip is in it for best results. The programming voltage is different between some of the older chips. There exists both 2764 and 2764A chips - both not CMOS, but both have different progamming voltage requirements. Same story with 2732 and 2732A's.
<br />
<br />IIRC, the voltages are the same for the "A" parts and the "C" parts in most cases, but still, it's best to select the correct part...
