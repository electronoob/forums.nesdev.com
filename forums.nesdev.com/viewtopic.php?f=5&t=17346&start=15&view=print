Nintendo waited until the tech became affordable (200 USD) before shipping it. This is also rumored to have happened in the N64 era, with Nintendo developing the GBC and a more ambitious project called Atlantis in parallel. Various cut-down versions of Atlantis appear to have become the GBA and DS.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">Espozo wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">Nintendo couldn't have quite predicted the console hardware arms race</div><br />I don't see how not. ColecoVision was a distinct improvement over the Atari 2600 and Odyssey2 that preceded it. The TMS9918 family VDC in the CV was so close to pixel-perfect relative to 1981 arcade tech that it's rumored to have inspired the NES PPU architecture.

(Without the game board.) And this is with arcade operator mark up, not like consoles where they were being sold at a loss.</div><br />And here we have a good example of generational gap knowledge.  So let someone older educate you a bit:<br /><br />Try US$3000, but often more.  Consider that the standard Pac-Man stand-up arcade, when it was released in 1980, went for $2400.  Before you reply, stop and think about the time period; $2400 now might not seem like much, but <a href="http://www.usinflationcalculator.com/" class="postlink">use this site</a> to get an idea of what $2400 in 1980 would be dollar-wise equivalent to now.  Starting to get the picture?  Arcades were EXPENSIVE.<br /><br />Also, you seem to be under the impression that arcade chassis back then were generally free-standing and general-purpose.  That's simply not the case: arcade chassis were intended for use with the game they came with.  Yes, you could tear them apart a bit and make them work with some other game, but sometimes a lot of work was involved.  Not all CRTs are universal in size or mounting, not to mention not all games used CRT monitors (consider games that used vector-based displays like Wells Gardner, e.g. Tempest, Asteroids, Black Widow, etc.).  The complexity varied.  It wasn't a question of time and money either, it was also a question of whether or not it was even worth modding the cabinet for another game; it might be easier as an operator (and it often was) to just sell or trade the game for a different one.<br /><br />It wasn't until much much later -- early 90s -- that companies started making their chassis a little more &quot;commonplace&quot; so that you could swap in/out PCBs, marquees, and control panel covers.  But there was no guarantee.  I'm also avoiding subjects like Neo Geo multi-game cabinets because those were unique in themselves, as well as &quot;unique&quot; arcade games (ex. ones that used guns, or super unique ones like Taiko no Tatsujin).<br /><br />There are a few guys here who can talk more at length about this subject; mikejmoffitt is one, and I owned a couple arcades in my time (sold one to Mike, actually!).  But the point is: no, arcade games were not cheap, and were often very unique/specific.

(Without the game board.)</div><br />Oh, wait, I meant the arcade machine system board, not the entire cabinet. Yeah, for the entire machine, it'd easily be upwards of $1,000. I largely based my assumption off the fact that the barebones Neo Geo AES package (one controller but no games) went for $400 in 1991, just one year after the MVS was released, which I think qualified as at least average for the time (high-end Sega and Namco arcade boards obviously still wiped the floor with it).<br /><br />Of course, it's difficult to just straight compare old console to old arcade hardware, because a lot of the hardware in an arcade machine was &quot;offloaded&quot; onto the game board (no vram for storing graphics data.)<br /><br />And yeah, true, I don't think it was really until the CPS1 that arcade machines could really reliably be divided into a system board and a game board, unless I'm wrong about this as well. You also still had Konami games and some other oddities like Raiden II though where the arcade PCB was built for one game specifically (there's only one board in the case of Raiden II at least).

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I didn't even bring up the fact that not all games are JAMMA either.  *chuckle*  For example, Capcom's Trojan isn't. If used in a non-Trojan cabinet, you end up having to build JAMMA adapters, blah blah.  My point is that arcades are generally &quot;unique&quot; on a per-game basis, barring some exclusions, and they *aren't* cheap (they weren't then, nor are they now.  They were semi-affordable in the very late 90s/early 2000s, but that has changed (for the worse) due to collectors and hoarders).  The number of &quot;unique&quot; aspects to each game vary across the board (ex. PCB pinout, unique joystick or control panels, vector vs. CRT, and in some cases, even unique voltages (this is actually rare, but when it does happen, it's a nightmare.  There are some games which used JAMMA but with voltages rather than common -12V +5V -5V combo, so if you ended up throwing them on a common PSU, you'd potentially blow stuff up or have a non-functional game).  That's all I have to say on the matter.  You can read my blog sometime for stories/tales of why arcade stuff is a bloody nightmare.

Unlike these weirdos, I don't sell my boards for exorbitant amounts.  There's nothing rare, unique, odd, or even &quot;prestigious&quot; about this game, yet the prices are stupid.  Because, like I said recently in an unrelated thread: it's all about money.  Other than some niche communities, these types of elevated prices are what you'll find on most commonplace auction sites.  I don't sell stuff at these prices; ethically I just wasn't meant for this type of world.<br /><br />In case you're curious about boards I own/owned and what they sold for in the past year, here you go.  I guarantee if you talked about this on some arcade forum, people would say &quot;lol whoever sold those boards got ripped off&quot; -- because like I said, today it's about money or hoarding, not about the hobby or appreciation of the classics.<br /><div class="attachtitle">Attachment:</div><div class="attachcontent">

Originally, third party support wasn't even in the cards. And why not? Surely it turned out more than profitable for them. It just wasn't a part of their roadmap. Who at Nintendo could have known that they would be so succesful that they would be &quot;expected&quot; to make a follow up to their system? No one <em>else</em> had made a follow up console at the time (unless you count the rapid gradual improvements of the odyssey series <img src="./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" />). This was a new way of thinking.

However, that's not including profit, and the fact that SNK's main revenue was in arcade machines.  If they made the console version too cheap, arcade owners wouldn't buy the cabinets.

I don't think they'd go at a loss for something as niche as it was, but an MVS is definitely going to be more expensive than an AES for no reason other than that they can get away with it.
