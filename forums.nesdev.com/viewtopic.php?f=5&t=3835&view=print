Also the chrarging time is much faster, is is done in 30 minutes instead of 4 hours like before.
<br />Anways is there any way to replace the battery or something ? Or should I just buy a DS ? But then in 3 years what will I do when my DS' battery will also fade out ?
<br />
<br />Also by the way the headphone adapter is broken, only right channel works, and since have sound only in one hear is worse than anything I just play withotu headpones. I don't know if there is a jack on the DS or if the same adaptater is needed, tough.

<br />Is there something about Nintendo and shoulder buttons? Our family has had a Game Boy Micro and two original DS systems with at least one busted shoulder button. Perhaps it's because the shoulder buttons are the most vulnerable to shock when jostling the system itself around.
<br />
<br />There are reports that if you have a screwdriver with a 3-prong head, you can clean out a shoulder button's mechanism and it will likely start working again.

<br />
<br />replacement batterys are not hard to find still and when they do get hard to find outher 3.7v batters that charge in the same way (like the one for the DS if I am not mistaken) can be retro fited
<br />
<br />
<br />anyway $5.10 replacement battery although they are backordered at the moment

It feels more natural to place your thumb across Y and B on a 4-button configuration, and most platformers over the past couple of decades have used that setup by default. Omitting such an option from the DS seems like a rather silly oversight.

<br />Player 1: A, B, Select, Start, Up, Down, Left, Right
<br />Player 3: A, B, Select, Start, Up, Down, Left, Right
<br />
<br />If you read 16 times from the Super NES controller, you get buttons in this order:
<br />Player 1: B, Y, Select, Start, Up, Down, Left, Right
<br />Player 1: A, X, L, R, garbage*4
<br />
<br />So NES A and B become Super NES B and Y, which is the basic layout that most games adopted.
<br />
<br />
<br />The Game Boy Advance controller returns buttons in this order:
<br />A, B, Select, Start, Right, Left, Up, Down, R, L, garbage*6
<br />
<br />The Nintendo DS controller returns buttons in this order:
<br />A, B, Select, Start, Right, Left, Up, Down, R, L, garbage*6
<br />X, Y, garbage*4, pen down, lid open, garbage*8
<br />
<br />So A stays A and B stays B, even though the average hand can more easily reach B and Y.

<br />I don't know if gaming shops sells such stuff, maybe I should just ask. If I don't find any maybe I'll just buy a DS, and if I really want to play the GBA that badly and the battery is dead, I'll have to switch batteries. Maybe I should also buy a GBC for very cheap as you can use normal batteries for it, and you can be sure it will work forever, unlike the GBA and DS where the battery needs to be replaced each so many years, and you can bet someday Nintendo will stop producting such batteries, and then the big pain will begin... Only GB and GBC games will still be playable.
<br />
<br />Oh, and also most of my GBA games are RPGs, so A/B button on the DS is not a problem, since for RPGs the standard buttons are still A and B on 4 button config. B and Y are for platformers, and I currently have only one single platformer for the GBA.

<br />
<br />Get the original GBA, it use normal batteries too <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />
<br />only problem there is no backlight.. so if you want that get afterburner kit too. And I personally prefer the old GBAs buttons to the NDS buttons. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />

<br />I don't like the idea to use original batteries, as ecologically this is a catastrophe, however if this is the only way to still be able to play my GBA games in 15 years then I'll do it. Maybe in the future nobody will have any usage of GBA SP, micro and DS because they all have faded batteries, and noone will produce compatible batteries, so used normal GBA will become very expensive and those f** games collectors will buy all of them, making them even more expensive, etc... I already see this catastophe coming from now, so I guess I'm gonna buy an original GBA before it's too late.
<br />
<br />Also its a real shame that there is no "standard" li-on battery that each company could sold and be used in the electonics devices of each company. Bacause many li-on batteries are just different mechanically, but not really that diffent, and due to purely commercial basis each company has its own li-ion battery differnent from all other to be sure people buy the remplacement batteries from them. Also I wouldn't be surprised if someday the li-ion battries will becomes obsolete as opposed to another kind of battery, and that means no new batteries for devices, that means that most devices of the 2000-2010 years will become unusable (or at least won't be portable any longer) while all devices from 1980-1999 years will hironically still be perfectly usable.

<br />
<br />On the DS the actual button locations is wrong for GBA mode play
<br />The biggest problem with the DS for me is that in GBA mode the button placement is wrong
<br />
<br />Y should be B and B should be A
<br />
<br />I would very much like a device witch can swap these buttons I believe a micro controller would be suitable for this so it can be easily switched back when is DS mode.
<br />
<br />I have some half-baked ideas on how to detect gba mode if you’re interested. If someone is willing to write the program and choose an appropriate chip I would be willing to do the testing and assume the hardware risk involved. (I am quite adapt at hardware modification)
<br />
<br />
<br />Fyi: Bregalad the store I linked to will get in stock before too long you can ask them about how long till they get some in and they should have a pretty good answerer for you. I don’t think you could find a better price
