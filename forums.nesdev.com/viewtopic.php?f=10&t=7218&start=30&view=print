<br />Yeah, that's an option, but RAM isn't a very abundant resource on the NES. Also, even though the PAL VBlank is longer, the rendered frame is shorter (in CPU cycles of course, it is the same as the NTSC one visually), so the fact that you'll have to fill more buffers during that time is more likely to cause slowdown.

<br />Interesting.  My sound engine doesn't distinguish music and sound effects, so I hadn't thought of that.  Still, I think the problem is theoretical; I can't think of any existing game where the sound effects need to be synchronized with the animation.  It still bugs me a little.

<br />True, these types of games require synchronization.  But I was thinking more generally.  For instance, consider a FPS, which has a machine gun.  If the animation for firing the gun includes showing shell casings, you'll want to make sure the sound of the shell casing happens in sync with the animation.  But on the NES, both animations and sound effects are lot simpler, so I can't think of existing NES games where this would matter (D+Pad Hero excluded).

<br />Then the shell casing should be a separate sound effect that starts when the animation starts.

<br />Well, to be fair, stretching them by skipping updates will probably just make them sound wrong, so it's not really a good solution.
<br />
<br />In every game I can think of, it's important that sound effects begin at the correct time, but if by any chance the video lags that doesn't really result in any weirdness.
<br />
<br />As for the games tepples listed, I wouldn't expect those kinds of games to drop frames, since they aren't very CPU-intensive. I mean, how complicated is it to move a few graphics around and match input to internal tables?

<br />That'll work sometimes, but other times it won't be convenient.  If you had the sound of the gunfire and the shell casing as a single recording, for instance.
