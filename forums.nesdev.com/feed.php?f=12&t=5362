Oh, joy! I can't read it at all. I even tried BSNES's source code but I still got nothing out of it. Oh well!<br /><br />Anyway, here is another question:<br />How does offset-per-tile mode work (particularly mode 6, although I presume that mode 2 is the same)? I know that you specify locations with layer 3 registers and the offset is for columns, not tiles. However, I want to know what gets displayed when you place one column of tiles on top of another one? In other words, if the offsets were all zero aside from one of them, other than the first, which was $10 (or would it be 8, since it uses half pixels?), what would show up on the column to the right of the normal position of the previously mentioned column?<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3964">Gekko</a> — Thu Jul 30, 2009 10:10 pm</p><hr />

Ah, thank you!<br />Also, I would have but I don't know much C/C++ and since I can't find anything in x86 I'd have to use a disassembler which would take even longer since it would not only be unlikely for it to be disorganized, due to the way compilers work but it would also have a lot of junk bytes (if you don't believe me, look <a href="http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/X86_Assembly/GAS_Syntax" class="postlink">here</a>) and a lack of comments, making it very difficult. (Not to mention that I'm not extremely well acquainted with x86, anyway. Just more so than C/C++.) Well, I guess I'll try to learn C/C++ more quickly so I can hope to understand the data in emulator source code soon.

I know how to calculate what you think I'm trying to calculate.<br />What I'm actually trying to calculate is the length of <strong>H-blank</strong> and <strong>V-blank</strong> (in cycles). I am not trying to calculate the length of each scanline, pixel or whatever. I know that H-blank and V-blank are not overscan, so my previous numbers were wrong. In addition, that also means that they are not considered by your formula or they are in a part of a scanline, where I do not know the length (and the H-blanking and V-blanking (moving the opposite way) themselves are not actually calculated).<br /><br />Oh right, they are open bus.... Well, at least there is an easy around not being able to use it as 16-bit/24-bit.

I already mentioned exactly how many cycles per scanline and scanlines per frame there were. This was based off the 21MHz clock (315/88*6m). To get your numbers, just divide.<br /><br />If you lda [$80] with D=2100, you will end up fetching whatever byte is at the address pointed to by $2181-2183, and then that value will be repeated for the next two reads. So say $2181-3 point to $7e0123, which contains #$5a. You'll end up reading from $5a5a5a. This is because $2181-3 are write-only. Reads return open bus, or the MDR (memory data register.) That register will be set upon the $2180 port read.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=375">byuu</a> — Thu Jul 23, 2009 6:21 pm</p><hr />

The NES's V-blank is 6810 Ricoh 5A22 master cycles. I still need to know if that's consistent with the SNES's V-blank and what it would be for H-blank. (Also, this means that overscan is not part of H/V-blank.)<br /><br />And now, for another question: Would using an indirect long mode that uses $2180 as its destination (i.e. LDA [$80] if the DP were $2100), would you get what would be the equivalent of [$[2181]] or would would it include $2181 and $2182 as the intermediate and high bytes, respectively?<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3964">Gekko</a> — Wed Jul 22, 2009 9:45 pm</p><hr />

I thought that the pixels outside of the visible scanline counted as H-blank and the scanlines outside of the actual viewing range were counted as V-blank. Again, correct me if I'm wrong. (I forgot about DRAM refresh. I'm assuming that it would would cut 40 cycles out of H-blank and V-blank, though.) If I'm wrong, though, I think that would leave H-blank and V-blank with very few cycles.<br /><br />Also, another question:<br />6) What is the clock speed of the Cx4 chip? How many cycles does it take to use each instruction?<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3964">Gekko</a> — Tue Jul 14, 2009 1:51 am</p><hr />

All scanlines are 1364 cycles long, with one exception:<br />NTSC-only with interlace off on scanline 240 on an odd field ($213f.d7=1) is only 1360 clock cycles. It has something to do with the NTSC color burst, I don't know exactly, but it really is short, crazy as it sounds.<br /><br />Also, 40 clocks from every scanline are spent on DRAM refresh, so you effectively can only execute 1324/1320 clocks per scanline.<br /><br />DRAM refresh occurs at H=530 on CPU revision 1, and it alternates between (starting at) H=538 and H=534 on each subsequent scanline (except that scanline that's only 1360 clocks, it's the same on that scanline as the scanline after that). DRAM refresh will supercede everything on the S-CPU side, even DMA.<br /><br />NTSC has 262 scanlines per field, PAL has 312. Interlace even fields have 263 or 313 scanlines, respectively.<br /><br />I know that (1364*262*60)-4 != exactly 315/88*1,000,000 (eg 21.477MHz). It's apparently close enough for TVs to display the image though.<br /><br />Like I said, I'd really appreciate it if someone could run an oscilloscope on the S-CPUs of both NTSC and PAL consoles.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=375">byuu</a> — Mon Jul 13, 2009 5:40 pm</p><hr />
