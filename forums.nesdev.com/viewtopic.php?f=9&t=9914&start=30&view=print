Didn't know why I didn't do this from the beginning, but anyway, better late than never. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I've learned that the VS-Duck Hunt game only uses one Zapper even if there's two players. My question is, is port 2 used on the arcade for anything usefull? I've found code-references to port 2 (not dip-switch related) so I'm curious what this might be..

The only things I can find are the reading and deserialization routines at $84D5-$84F5 (which always reads from $4017) and $A93E-A956 (which reads from $4016 or $4017 per the value in zeropage$b6, but discards the value returned). Everything else is congruous with the wiki: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://wiki.nesdev.com/w/index.php/Vs._System">http://wiki.nesdev.com/w/index.php/Vs._System</a><!-- m -->.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Can you tell what kind of device it's trying to read in port 2?<br /><br />I know that NES Duck Hunt uses the joypads to control the ducks (which is why the two ducks mode is called 2P... on the Famicom you can have both controllers and the gun together, and the two controllers can be used to control the ducks). Maybe something similar is going on here?

It's a pretty clever routine for reading the bits actually. Controllerdata for $4017 is stored at $441 and $443. Not sure what happens with that data however..

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Ok, I looked more closely:<br />The routine at $84D5-$84F5 deserializes $4016 and $4017 into $0440 and $0441, respectively. $0442 and $0443 contain the number of times that the joystick-reading routine has been called that the contents of $0440 or $0441 have been the same, respectively. Once the value in $0440 and $0441 has been the same 5 times in a row, it's copied to $16 and $17.<br /><br />But the only place I can ever find any of these being used is for the alarm. (Then again, I can only get about 2/3 of the 32KiB PRG to show up in FCEUX's Code/Data Log viewer)<br /><br />The routine at $A938-A956 specifically polls for the trigger of the lightgun, returning the eighth and final read from $4016 or $4017 (per $B6. But $B6 is always 0, so we only check the one gun attached to $4016). When entered at $A93C, it instead reads only 7 times, and so polls the &quot;light sensed&quot; output.<br /><br />But you already know all this, since you made the patch <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />

I know many<br />people have it running on SD card based multicarts but<br />I've not read anything about anyone getting it to work<br />with good ol' eproms and a MMC1 retail pcb donor. Any<br />info would be greatly appricated cause I have no idea<br />why it's not working as it should.

Never was able to get any with battery backup versions to work correctly. All would load and play but on high score screen there were no names just some sprite where they should be and all had a score of 606060 or something like that. Also the ducks and pigeons flight patterns always stayed the same and no dog jumping on bonus stage. Reported to oRBIT2002 and he looked into but never found anything that should lead to the problems I encountered so maybe something on my end.

Maybe oRBIT2002 should look how it was fixed since both hack added battery backup.
