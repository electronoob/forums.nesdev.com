Packs of 150 questions per game genre are also available, but cost 99 cents each.<br /><br />Anywho, I want to start adding periodic free &quot;community packs&quot; each containing questions submitted by users.  So if anyone has some good NES trivia questions and want to share, the submission site is at <a href="http://nes-question-submission.herokuapp.com/" class="postlink">http://nes-question-submission.herokuapp.com/</a><br /><br />NES.quiz is on Google Play <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.dullahansoft.app.quiz" class="postlink">https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.dullahansoft.app.quiz</a>

The original North American release uses the name Princess Toadstool, but I think she was <span style="font-size: 125%; line-height: normal">ピーチ姫</span> Peach-hime (hime == princess) in the original Japanese version. (Case in point: the title of the animated feature <em>Super Mario Bros.: Peach-hime Kyushutsu Dai Sakusen</em>.) I haven't seen the manual of the VC rerelease. One could, however, argue that this is an NES quiz, not a Famicom quiz, and in regions where it was called the NES, she wasn't called Peach until the N64 with the exception of <em>Yoshi's Cookie</em> for Super NES.<br /><br />Another question had a minor misspelling:<br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">Which of the following is not a level in the game <em>Ducktails</em>?</div><br />For one thing, the title is <em>DuckTales</em>, <strong>le</strong> not <strong>il</strong>, except in regions where <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9v3OvzZsfM" class="postlink">morphine</a> makes the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cK0wyUt-qRU&amp;feature=related" class="postlink">holy known</a>, where it was called <em>Ankronikka</em>. But then maybe I'm just being a <a href="http://uncutohh.ytmnd.com/" class="postlink">taco Nazi</a>.<br /><br />Second run:<br /><br />卐 This misspelling was in more than one Q about <em>DuckTales</em>.<br /><br />卐 Once <em>Bayou Billy</em> was written as &quot;Billy Bayou&quot;.

Since the mobile app is only released in Canada and the states I stuck with only NA specific questions.  The question you mention could be cleaned up to make that clear.  Also, no offense intended for the non-NA crowd of course.  In fact a Famicom quiz pack could be fun if I was able to to drum up enough questions.<br /><br />P.S.  Out of curiosity did you get the question right about what the voice says at the beginning of Bayou Billy?  I should probably ditch that question...

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I got the Bayou Billy voice question right in my first run because several years ago, I went through a whole bunch of games using raw $4011 audio and tried to decode how they compress their audio. It turned out a <em>lot</em> of them use 4-bit nibble encoding. Should I try a third run to see if I can get more questions wrong? And how many people have actually played Bayou Billy?

Don't remember why it sucked so much, perhaps I'll have to pull it out now and reminisce of awesomely horrible NES games.
