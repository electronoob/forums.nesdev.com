		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Using 1px weight on letters can look sufficient on emulators, and opens up for differently feeling typefaces than the ones commonly shown in nes games. However sadly, they often get illegible on real hardware, especially if it's not pure white on black. The parts that typically get scrambled the worst on hardware are the the arms of the letters (the | | in N, | in R, and so on).<br /><br />If you want them hardware-proof but don't want to ruin their lightweight nature by making them bold or art-decofied, you can try drop shadowing with any available darker colour within the palette used. It can also help make the 'select' lines appear symmetrical in relation to tilesize and the options. <br /><br />This is just an example; there are other ways to shade (less or more weight, direction).<div class="attachtitle">Attachment:</div><div class="attachcontent">

However, as soon as the contrast drops, you're in the risk zone. Better try it on a few hardware setups before publishing in that case (rca,RF).

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Rule of thumb: Each pixel is only two-thirds of a color subcarrier cycle wide. So when you're using 1px-wide details, try to guarantee contrast by having the maximum of the dark waveform less than the minimum of the light waveform. (See <a href="https://wiki.nesdev.com/w/index.php/NTSC_video" class="postlink">NTSC video</a> for how waveforms are generated.)<br /><br />The following color combinations are known to keep 1-pixel-wide details distinct:<br /><ul><li>White ($20) with dark backgrounds ($0x, $11-$1C).<br />A lot of my low-level NES tests, such as the FME-7 big WRAM test and the overclock test before I folded it into 240p Test Suite, use white text on medium brown ($18).</li><li>Black ($0F) with light backgrounds ($10, $20-$2C, $3x).<br /><em>Action 53</em> menu uses black text on light gray ($20), and <em>RHDE</em> uses black text on pale yellow ($38).</li><li>In a pinch, $31-$3C and $01-$0C can be paired.<br />A few controls in 240p Test Suite pair pale yellow ($38) with dark blue ($02).</li><li>If two colors have the same or adjacent hues, you can pair $0x with $2y or $1x with $3y, such as $27 with $06 or $38 with $18.<br />This violates sets max(dark) and min(light) near equal, but because the chroma doesn't change phase, edges won't be quite as distorted as if a different hue were paired with these. </li></ul><br /><br />EDIT: Assertion fixed
