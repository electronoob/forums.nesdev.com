		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />My <a href="http://www.retrousb.com/index.php?productID=134" class="postlink">PowerPak Lite</a> cart is now available!  This is a RAM cart used for CopyNES.  It will automatically configure for 8 different mappers including:
<br />
<br />iNES 0 - NROM
<br />iNES 1 - MMC1
<br />iNES 2 - U*ROM
<br />iNES 3 - CNROM
<br />iNES 7 - A*ROM
<br />iNES 11 - ColorDreams
<br />iNES 34 - BNROM
<br />iNES 66 - GNROM
<br />
<br />Right now it is only supported by the qbasic CopyNES software, but should be easy to add to CopyNESW.  I do not have a system that will run CopyNESW so I cannot test it.  The <a href="http://www.tripoint.org/kevtris/Projects/copynes/flash.html" class="postlink">flash programming mod</a> is needed.
<br />
<br />This cart can only be used in a CopyNES system.  Once the power is turned off or the cart is removed the RAM will erase.

Bad headers also trip up emulators, the main exception being Nestopia (which has its own ROM database for resolving bad headers).  The mirroring flag, battery flag, and the upper bits of the mapper number are very frequently set wrong.  The arcade flags, the WRAM size field, and the NTSC/PAL flag are even less reliable (if they are used at all).  This continues to plague the NES emulation scene, and the problem may never go away (unless ROM sites actually begin fixing headers, which they don't seem to want to bother doing).

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />dvdmth is right, the .nes headers are used and completely trusted.  There is no crc database to check like in some emulators.  No reason to have bad headers, everyone talks about new file formats without bothering to correctly use the one that is everywhere now.  Might help if emulators either fixed or just warned about bad bits when they are found.
<br />
<br />In this case if the mapper high bits are wrong it will say not a supported mapper and refuse to load.  If the H/V is wrong then graphics may be corrupt.  If PRG/CHR size are wrong it might crash, havent tested that part.  Other parts like WRAM size or battery bit aren't used by the PowerPak Lite.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Having emulators automatically fix bad headers will definitely help here, but it won't solve the problem completely (a complete solution probably doesn't exist, however, so I guess a partial remedy is better than no remedy at all).
<br />
<br />Perhaps someone should extract Nestopia's ROM database and write a ROM header correcting program based on it.  Once the program is ready, bunnyboy can either add the program to his site for download or link to it.  Provide instructions to the user informing him to verify the ROMs using that program prior to using them on the PowerPak.  The validation program can also generate an empty .sav file of the correct size (i.e. 8K for most games, 1K for MMC6 games, 16K/32K for MMC1/MMC5 games with larger WRAM, etc.) which can then be loaded onto the CF card if the user doesn't have a battery RAM file already.
