		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I'm of the mind that typically there is only one main programmer of a given entry.  <br /><br />If one person contributes art/music to two separate entries, with two separate programmers, the fact the programmers are different separates the teams into two different teams for prize consideration.<br /><br />For example:<br />Basket ball game:<br />-programmer: mario<br />-music: princess<br />-audio engine: luigi<br /><br />Football game:<br />-programmer: luigi<br />-music: princess<br />-audio engine: luigi<br /><br />If the basketball game wins 1st place, and football game wins 2nd place, these are seen as two separate teams.  Just because luigi shared his audio engine with mario, and princess composed the music for both, the games were primarily developed by two separate people.<br /><br />As the rules are written though, I think these would be seen as the same team submitting two entries.  It would especially sound that way if a 4th person made the artwork for both games.  At that point it might seem like a team is just taking turns who's the main developer/programmer.<br /><br />Ultimately we can't cover every possible scenario in the rules.  I think the rules as they stand are as explanatory as we need.  Further elaboration on this will only confuse things.  This is something best left to the judgement of the organizers I feel.  And entrants are welcome to elaborate on their situation explaining why they should be judged as separate teams, and let the organizers make a judgement call.

If multiple submissions place in a cash winning position, the greatest prize will be awarded, and the runner up will receive the prize.  You can only win one cash prize. You can only win one cartridge. You can only win one physical prize.</li><li>Collaborations are allowed, prize distribution will be decided by those who collaborated on the project.</li></ul></div><br /><br />I don't think adding percentages will solve anything. Every project is going to be different, and we aren't going to fill all the loopholes. I'm going to recommend the following change.  Thoughts?<br /><br /><ul><li>Only one cash/cartridge/physical prize will be awarded per entrant across all categories. If multiple submissions place in a cash winning position, the greatest prize will be awarded, and the runner up will receive the prize.  You can only win one cash prize*. You can only win one cartridge**. You can only win one physical prize.</li><li>Collaborations are allowed, prize distribution will be decided by those who collaborated on the project. This decision should be known by the person who submitted the entry as they will be our primary contact. Please make these decisions beforehand.<br /><br />*In the event that a single entrant wins multiple cash prizes, regardless of who collaborated on the projects, the person who submits the project represents the whole. i.e., Project A and Project B won 1st and 2nd respectively.  They were submitted by Bob. Larry was a collaborator on Project B.  There will only be one cash prize for the two projects.  Sorry Larry, talk to Bob (or see below).<br />**If the entry is a collaboration, additional cartridges may be purchased at cost for fellow collaborators (or deducted from a cash prize if applicable).</li></ul>

What's your thoughts on that? Also, the absense of rules on team wins requires actively making deals (which may amount to nothing), repeatedly. A collective agreement is energy and time saving, perhaps a bit more secure, thus encouraging team efforts.<br /><br />Hm, but perhaps the rules shouldn't explicitly specify how hypothetical prizes are split between team members, though, since contributions can vary, and/or if you think that is discouraging teaming up.</div><br /><br />But that's a matter of honesty. If you look our blurbs, there are three people involved in my three entries. I might be the programmer and do most the GFX, but Davidian is the sound guy and Anjuel has made quite a lot of input in the design of the game (with a 9 months old baby he's quite busy now). Had I wanted to cheat, I could have entered the contest as three different &quot;entrants&quot;, making Davidian and Anjuel submit one game each. In such case, we would have perceived two prizes as we have scored a 4th and 5th position. But I don't find that honest. That would be cheating and taking advantage of a loophole. Not my cup of tea.<br /><br />Anyways, we are grown up adults and this compo is small enough so special situations can be dealt with personally and solved practically. <br /><br />I like the idea to purchase extra carts at cost. I'll be purchasing two extra carts for Davidian and Anjuel <img src="./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" />

According to last year, changes where allowed long after the deadline without making it &quot;category 2&quot; games. Is it targeted to entrant of previous years, to take time to expand their entries? Is it for any kind of game that is finished?

The project must be effectively complete to be included on the cart.  So they may be motivated to finish their project to the point where it's publishable so it'll get included on the cart.  The action53 project effectively provides developers means to get their creations on a physical cartridge without really having to do any of the work involved with publishing physical cartridges.

(I won't post it, don't worry.)<br />It had two different scenes, one in a run-down cathedral, and another in a hellspawn-infested underground passage.<br /><br />If it was developed, the game would be too complex to be entered in the compo, as the sprites are quite large, and require dynamic CHR-RAM. (The main character alone, stood at about 56 pixels tall!)<br /><br />The project starred a nun girl with huge boobs, ripping zombies into chunks, with a metal chainwhip.<br />Gore is easy on the NES, it's just that nobody has bothered too much with it.<br /><br />The mockup exists, only because I had read that &quot;Splatterhouse: Wanpaku Graffiti&quot; was made as a joke, and deliberately left out the gore, because they didn't believe that the NES could handle it. (Mighty Final Fight also exists, for a similar reason.)

Following the rules is generally all that's needed to get inclusion on the multicart.
