Shouldn't they be marked mapper 64 (Tengen's Rambo-1/MMC-3 Clone)? I'm just curious, as no Tengen cartridge should contain a MMC-3 right? Only their cloned version.

<br />
<br />Mapper 64 is RAMBO-1 and not too many games used it.  It's very similar to an MMC3 but has more banks (i.e. 8 1K CHR and 3 8K PRG banks) that I remember... and cycle based IRQ along with scanline based IRQs.  That is why alot of emulators didn't run skull and crossbones.  It uses the CPU cycle mode.
<br />
<br />MIMIC-1 is indeed what Tengen called their MMC3-similar mapper.  It's basically a stripped down MMC3 without IRQs or mirroring.  MIMIC-1 carts have hardware mirroring.  The PCB says "MIMIC-1" on it, AFAIR.  Been a few years since I had a cart open.
<br />
<br />It's an exact clone? of the Namco chip, which is marked 106 or something, been ages since I looked now.  You find those mapper chips on the DEROM/DEIROM boards.  It's a MIMIC-1.  The Tengen and Namco chips have an identical pinout and function identically too.

<br />
<br />That's what I thought as well. 
<br />
<br />I also find it interesting to hear about a game that actually uses CPU cycle mode for IRQs. Now I can actually test that in my emulator. Also, Namco 106 probably isn't what you mean for an exact clone because Namco 106 (iNES 019) has IRQs and CHR-RAM and CHR-ROM at the same time capabilities if I remember right. 
<br />
<br />So is Mapper 206 a MMC-3 variant with no IRQs and hard wired mirroring?

<br />This method breaks NTSC/PAL compatibility, so no that mapper isn't that great. PPU cycles would be the real way to go, altough a little hard to do. A scanline counter based on A13 or (/RD AND /WR) should be the most accurate in my opinion.

<br />So did Tengen's Rabbit key chip, which had only the North American key.

<br />There are multiple Namco chips that all fit into mapper 19, MIMIC-1 is a clone of the original without IRQ (which was also the first ASIC mapper IIRC).

<br />
<br />As for NTSC/PAL, you should have seperate builds for each anyway, so there is no reason you wouldn't change the cycle count when you do that anyway.

<br />
<br />Joining the 108/109/118 family is the 119, fittingly enough I guess.
<br />
<br />The only difference I've been able to gather between these chips is the manufacturer.
<br />
<br />108 = Fujitsu
<br />109 = Sharp
<br />118 = Panasonic
<br />
<br />and the 119 is again made by Sharp though....
<br />
<br />And joining the 163 is the 175 and 340 (still no 106!) All 3 chips are made by Fujitsu. A while back Marty had mentioned he thought there may be a stripped down version of the 163, and that could very well be what these are. I haven't played with them yet to test their functionality, but they must share at least bankswitching in common because I've seen 163's used in their place in other carts.
<br />
<br />I will get around to documenting them eventually. I know I've been pretty sparse lately, but I'm still around and still working in the background...

<br />Of course it is great, it has <strong>both</strong> types of IRQs... So if you're shooting for NTSC/PAL compatibility, just go with the scanline counter. Nintendo has no excuse for spreading such a limited mapper as the MMC3, since there seem to be many affordable chips out there without the shortcommings of the MMC3.

<br />
<br />I'm sure there excuse was cost but I agree with you. I think it's a shame because MMC3 was very close to nearly all you could want yet still stayed a step away. Having 2 fixed PRG banks, and the odd 6 CHR banks, then rounded out with the limitation of the scanline counter. It's shameful that Tengen's MMC3 clone actually is everything the Nintendo MMC-3 should have been.

In 1983 they were breaking ground with just 16k NROM games compared to Atari 2800 (2600) and Sega SG-1000.
