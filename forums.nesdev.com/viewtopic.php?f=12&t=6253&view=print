<br />BTW, I noticed that the creator of the SDK started working again on the SDK for a short time some months ago. So this (my) SDK isn't the newest anymore, but nearly all his changes had to do with the replacement of Snes9X with BSNES as the test emulator.
<br />
<br />Has anyone used the SDK to create something worth mentioning so far? Something looking like a game? <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Of course it gets easier with the SDK as I can write C code. I also already had a small platforming engine running last time I tried it. But as I am used to programming on a PC where you have nearly unlimited power compared to the SNES it is quite difficult. It's interesting nonetheless <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />
<br />The most difficult part however is that for some things you HAVE to use assembly... which is another hurdle.
<br />Maybe you're right and programming on the SNES is as difficult as on other platforms, however I'm used to using libraries which simplify things. For example OGRE3D for graphics, Lua for scripting etc

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Yeah, you'd have to learn the hardware, but I'm not sure what parts you would <em>have</em> to code in assembly (the interrupts maybe?).  regblah = 0 should translate to LDA #0 / STA regblah, just as useless if you aren't 100% sure what 'regblah' is, heheh.
<br />
<br />You sure about the amount of CPU power you need, too?  I mean, even with how slow the NES is (SNES is almost twice as fast) the main limitation to run into is the amount of PPU data to transfer during vblank.  SNES has DMA, so that has ceased to be a problem.
<br />
<br />Thanks for uploading that, I've been really curious to see it, but wasn't sure how to get started.  If you think you might want to maintain a windows build of that, and need an ftp account for storage, I could give you one.

Of course I know it's the SNES after all, and my code was written with the PC in mind (performance wise). I could have optimized it easily I guess.
<br />
<br />If you want to upload the SDK binaries somewhere to your website I would like it, as it won't get lost so easily. I wouldn't want to call myself a maintainer as I'm currently working on other things again, however I have included a detailed description on how to compile the SDK. From what I read not all steps written there are still needed because of said updates to the SDK. My revision is 67, the newest is 78.
<br />
<br />BTW what has been on my mind for some time, are you the same as this person?
<br /><a href="http://ocremix.org/artist/4344/memblers" class="postlink">http://ocremix.org/artist/4344/memblers</a>
<br />Just looking at the homepage link on OC Remix, I think I have answered the question myself <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />

<br />
<br />Any time-critical code (e.g. the NMI handler). Go ahead and look at the output from the compiler sometime <img src="./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" />  A human being can write code that's 2-3 times faster in most cases.
<br />
<br />Assembly is also the preferred way of writing code that's going to be copied to RAM; both because the C compiler AFAIK lacks any way of specifying that a function should go into RAM, but also because of the dramatic savings in code size that you can achieve.
<br />
<br />Then there are the inexplicable compiler bugs that I ran into when I tried to compile a .c file consisting of 3000+ lines, split into about 50 functions. The compiler barfed on it, and my only guess is that it has some hard limit for how many local labels it can manage within the same source file, or something crazy like that.

<br />
<br />Consider this beauty (this was generated by the C compiler in the case I mentioned):
<br />
<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">.s__local_1024:<br />ection &quot;.text_0x0&quot; superfree<br /></div><br />*Why* is it trying to squeeze in a label in the middle of a section directive? <img src="./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" /> That label shouldn't be anywhere near there. And it does the same thing a few lines further down.<br /><br /><br />Or this line:<br /><br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">mem_cpy&#40;rbuff, &amp;&#40;fp-&gt;buf&#91;fp-&gt;fptr &amp; &#40;SS&#40;fp-&gt;fs&#41;-1&#41;&#93;&#41;, rcnt&#41;;<br /></div><br /><br />The compiler gives me an error with the very meaningful description "ICE 2". So I rewrite it as:<br /><br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">offs = fp-&gt;fptr &amp; &#40;SS&#40;fp-&gt;fs&#41;-1&#41;;<br />mem_cpy&#40;rbuff, &amp;&#40;fp-&gt;buf&#91;offs&#93;&#41;, rcnt&#41;;<br /></div>
<br />
<br />And then it magically compiles.
