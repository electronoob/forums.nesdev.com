I wonder if any MMC3 games even really use the WRAM disable.  Unless I misunderstand it's use, it seems like it might OK for write-protect at power up, but be completely useless after that.  Few games used a &quot;safe to turn off the NES now&quot; type of screen, where it might make sense for power-off.  Read-only RAM, having to enable writing every time you need to write to it?  bleh.  Even more useless if it's not battery-backed.<br /><br />I've made a couple custom mappers with WRAM (no battery, so no corruption to worry about), and in both cases I simply connected the NES CPU's R/W line directly to the WRAM's /WE.  Maybe you could try that.  Since /CE works, and /OE is always enabled, I'd think that would work.  With battery-backup, I don't know, but perhaps it would still work.<br /><br />I guess one question would be, did any AX5202P carts even use battery backup?<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=10">Memblers</a> — Mon Dec 08, 2014 7:33 pm</p><hr />

I've played around with the AX5202P before and have had no trouble with SRAM and saving (on the chips that worked). I've wired it up as a TNROM board and it kept the saves just fine.<br /><br />That being said, I had ordered a few from a seller online and something like 7 out of 10 chips didn't work properly, or at all. Some would load the game, but the IRQ didn't work (so games with a status bar would crash), and some didn't load games at all. I may have had one that didn't work with SRAM as well...but I can't remember.<br /><br />I'd say your best bet is to try a few of them and see if they give the same results.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=5783">getafixx</a> — Mon Dec 08, 2014 4:19 pm</p><hr />
