		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Does anybody know what's up with YouTube's recent habit of changing the video size to arbitrary values every few days or when I delete the cache or whatever?<br /><br />I mean, look at this:<br /><div class="attachtitle">Attachment:</div><div class="attachcontent">
			<a href="./download/file.php?id=13227&amp;mode=view"><img src="./download/file.php?id=13227&amp;t=1" alt="YouTube.png" /></a><br />
			<span class="gensmall">YouTube.png [ 394.17 KiB | Viewed 214 times ]</span>
		

		<br />
	</div><br /><br />What is that? How can I influence this size?<br />It's the same PC, the same screen resolution, everything the same.<br /><br />The only difference in this particular case is: One time, I'm logged in, the other time I'm not. But some days ago, the smaller video size was also used for the not logged in version.<br /><br /><br />And no, this has <em>nothing</em> to do with fullscreen or cinema mode since both videos are obviously in regular mode. Cinema mode shows the video in full screen width and not just in varying degrees of arbitrary width, so simply clicking the little rectangle icon is obviously <em>not</em> the solution here.

What can this have to do with different aspect ratios and all that stuff?<br /><br />If they're still trying to figure it out, shouldn't there still be just one and the same video size for the same client configuration at any given moment in time?<br /><br />How is it possible that I can switch back and forth between two sizes by just logging in and logging out?<br /><br />Also, what does the question whether the video's width takes 54 % of the screen width or whether it takes 65 % have to do with adapting it to different output sizes in the first place, especially when we're not talking about some mobile version, but about the same standard desktop PCs that were used to play YouTube videos since 2004?<br />So, 14 years later, they suddenly &quot;have to figure out&quot; the best size relation between &quot;video vs. recommendations&quot;. Now they get the idea that a certain non-fullscreen video size is much too big and that it's definitely better to make it <em>smaller</em>?<br /><br />Are these people mentally retarded?<br /><br />Yeah, I'm sure many people used to say:<br />&quot;This video's originally encoded size is 640 x 480 pixels. DAMN YOU, YouTube, for actually showing the non-fullscreen version in a 640 x 480 pixels player on my HD screen. Why u no make it smaller???&quot;

Upscaling a Game Boy Color game by a factor of 25, from 160x144 to 800x720 pixels, just to activate high motion on YouTube is so wasteful of both uploaders' and viewers' bandwidth that some uploaders have instead chosen to upload high motion encodes on a separate website.

The comments are below, not to the side. The current relation is between video and recommendations list, not between video and comments.<br /><br />Even if it had to do with the comments:<br />I already said that the logged in/logged out thing is purely coincidental today. Some days ago, everything was smaller, no matter the login status.<br /><br />Also, if the comments had anything to do with it, then the logged in version should be the larger one because that's the situation where you can participate in the comments.

I didn't ask why the videos look different by showing you a movie trailer and an NES longplay. It was two times the same movie trailer, so this particular speculation about black bars in 4:3 videos is obviously objectively not relevant for the issue at hand.<br /><br /><br />&quot;The different video size comes from deemphesizing the comments section when you cannot participate in commenting.&quot;<br /><br />Even though in my example it's the non-logged-in version that has the bigger video size and therefore the wider comment section, so you're even contradicting yourself here by saying non-logged-in makes the video smaller because of the comments.<br /><br /><br />Speculation is all good and well, but if you speculate something that contradicts the established facts, then this brings us nowhere.<br /><br />(That's also the reason why I mentioned cinema mode and fullscreen: Because I knew for a fact, hadn't I explicitly mentioned that both videos use the same setting here, somebody definitely, without a doubt, 100 % sure, <em>would</em> have written: &quot;You can change the video size by clicking the small icons on the lower right corner.&quot;)
