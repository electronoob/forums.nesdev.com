		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />The PC10 version of Mike Tyson's Punch-Out has a record keeping feature for fastest times. I would like to have that feature on a regular NES cart. <br /><br />I have established that I can put pc10 prg and chr on a punch out test cart and the game will run. i skipped ahead to the tyson fight and won, and then the game froze. I assume it's due to there not being anything in the wram space to update for record keeping.<br /><br />donor issues: <br />no battery<br />no wram<br /><br />I think I can work out the battery so let's skip that part for now. <br /><br />How would I go about wiring wram to a punch out donor board? the wiki entry for mmc2 does not mention wram support, but based on what photos of the pc10 board I could find, it uses some version of the chip labeled as mmc2.

Kevtris was suggesting you would only have to decode PRG /CE, a14,13 if you connected m2 to ce2.  <br /><br /><br />And yes, all address and data lines match up with PRG rom.  Although if its easier for routing you REALLY only need to make sure an address line is connected to an a0-12 address line on the PRG rom, and similarly with data.  You can mix any address pin with any address pin, and any data pin with any other data pin.  And it'll all be the same.<br /><br />Also one trick you can do is bend all the pins up and place the SRAM underneath the PRG rom on the BOTTOM of the pcb.  Just make sure you keep the CE/we signals separate...

If you hadn't already bought them, I might suggest you try buying a 7410 (3-input NAND) instead. But yes, avoid floating inputs.<br /><br />And yes, for a RAM you can completely scramble the A lines with other A lines, and D lines with other D lines. But the order for A12..A0 and D0..D7 should be the same between a 6264 and the PRG ROM in your cartridge, so that should be unnecessary.

If you have an actual 6264, or the datasheet for your RAM explicitly mentions supporting it, then you should be able to also tie RAM /OE to ground.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />hooray it works! I put the pieces together minus the battery circuit and it works great.<br /><br />the assembly is kind of messy. I used a skinny M8464 chip for ram as that gave me room to put the ram chip flat on the back of the board behind the PRG.  I used with a 7420 and tied the 4 signal lines to it, and then tied the ram chip CE2 right to 5v. I think for the next build I would try to use M2 for CE2 as suggested above to save a wire. I also started with a (Mr. Dream) Punch Out for a donor. I'm pretty sure there is only 1 CHR file for all versions of MTPO, so if you started with a MTPO donor you wouldn't have to replace the CHR chip.<br /><br />I took a pic of the record screen after beating Glass Joe. Without the ram chip, the game will freeze up when going from the ring scene to the record screen. This was actually the second fight where I got the 9th place score (FWD). The top score is from the 1st fight where I got a 1 punch knock out.<br /><br />So far my only disappointment is that I don't know how to bring up the best times for Tyson. If you skip right to him, it asks for your initials (like it would starting a normal game), but the &quot;win&quot; sequence plays out the same. I'm pretty sure the time gets recorded, since the game without ram will freeze after beating Tyson. I tried leaving the game on the title screen to see if it shows up in attract mode anywhere, but it doesn't look like it.<br /><br />So anyway I'm overall happy. Thanks for the help everyone!

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />One thing to keep in mind is those 0.3&quot; DIP SRAMs are usually not low power while in stby.  They typically draw drastically more than the 0.6&quot; versions that draw less than a microamp usually.  You can measure the current draw with 10K resistor in series to figure out how much current it's actually drawing while in stby.  If you've got the part number you can also see what the datasheet says.  My guess is your battery will only last a few months vice several years...

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />yeah, I thought about that when planning this out. I went ahead with this build to verify I could make it work. <br /><br />The chip I used was MB8464A-15L. There actually is an ultra-low power version of that chip found in NES carts, MB8464A-80LL. But from what I can tell it's only used as wram for Batman Return of the Joker. Batman doesn't have a battery so I could harvest that chip and replace it with one that you sometimes find as chr-ram (the one I used here). I just didn't want to pull one and then wreck it due to never having done this.

The main difference is I'm using an early MTPO cart with a lower pcb revision, and what looks like an earlier version of the MMC2. With everything wired up in equal configuration to the first working cart, I get just a black screen. It appears the ram is interfering, as I can hard-disable the ram and the game runs fine up until it actually needs the ram (after you beat glass joe, for instance). Right now I have ram /OE right to GND, and looking back through this thread, the bit about inverting R/W for ram enable is something I wasn't doing. I figured I would give that a shot before I tear it down again and try on a newer PO cart.

I've never seen a SRAM that doesn't allow you to do that, although one could exist I suppose.<br /><br />The wiki is talking about preventing bus conflicts on the PRG ROM /OE line.  You don't have to worry about this though, the MMC2 will prevent bus conflicts for you.<br /><br />So in short the whole bus conflict thing you're wondering about being the problem is probably not the actual issue...<br /><br />Check, check, check your connections.  That's about the only advise to give if you got the first cart working.
