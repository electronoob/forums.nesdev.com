		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Hello Everyone,<br />I am making a tile editor and tile map editor that currently only supports the sega genesis.<br />The way it works is it stores a true color tile and it will automatically reduce it to the selected palette (There will be a choice of dithering algorithms or no dithering at all right now it only supports floyd steiburg).<br />I do not know of any editors that are able to do this and I was thinking about just how useful this technology is and I realized that this  should not be limited to just one platform.<br />Alot of retro game systems use a tile and a palette so I would not have to re-invent the wheel.<br />Another advantage is when making a cross platform game there would be no need to rework the graphics<br />and speaking of not having to redo graphics another advantage of this is if you need to add a last minute tile and there are no good color to use all you would have to do is add the tile and the palette can automatically adjust it's self (it will be able to automatically find an optimal palette for the tiles).<br />Sorry if this ended up as an advertisement I was trying to describe the program it will be free and open source.<br />So I was just wondering how the NES stores the palette and tiles and what are the RGB values for the palette on the sega genesis they are simply in steps of 36.<br />As you can tell I am much more familiar with the sega genesis hardware than the NES hardware.<br />Also plane mapping is plane mapping a byte or a word that stores what each tile goes where and nothing else? On the sega genesis plane mapping has a few flags like which palette row to use and if the tile is flipped either vertically or horizontally or both and a priority bit.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />The &quot;correct NES palette&quot; is a <em>very</em> complex problem for people used to RGB. The video signal is <a href="http://wiki.nesdev.com/w/index.php/NTSC_video" class="postlink">generated directly in the composite domain</a>, with hue in steps of 30 degrees in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YUV" class="postlink">YUV plane</a> and four predefined brightnesses per hue. Different TVs decode them differently (which is also a problem with RGB VDPs, but composite encoding and decoding have historically been glossed over on most of those systems). <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/viewtopic.php?f=3&amp;t=8209" class="postlink">This topic</a> should get you started on what's involved.<br /><br />The <a href="http://wiki.nesdev.com/w/index.php/PPU_pattern_tables" class="postlink">tile format itself</a> is a <em>lot</em> simpler, but it's planar, not packed. If you've ever looked at Game Boy or SMS tiles, you should have no trouble figuring out planar. The palette consists of one background color, four sets of three colors for the background, and four sets of three colors for the sprites. Each background color set is assigned to a 16x16 pixel (2x2 tile) area, not an individual 8x8 pixel tile like on the Genesis, Super NES, GBC, and GBA, so tiles have to be reassigned to color sets on a 16x16 pixel basis, not 8x8, which is why so many NES games had background objects the size of the <img src="http://pics.pineight.com/prtlg/qblk.png" alt="Image" /> blocks in <em>Super Mario Bros.</em> series.

Hope to finish my program soon.<br />Edit: I was browsing the wiki and you call them name tables I called them plane mapping in my post sorry about that. Well either way thanks for the helpful link I am reading more about the PPU right now.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />The name tables (plane mapping) have 1 byte per tile, so they hold just tile indexes and nothing more. There's no priority control for background tiles and they can't be flipped, but a separate table (the attribute table) is used to specify what palettes are used for which tiles. Each byte in the attribute table selects 4 palettes for an area of 4x4 tiles, where each 2x2 tiles uses the same palette. There's one mapper though, the MMC5 (it's very complex and was used in very few games), which has a special mode that allows individual tiles to use any of the 4 palettes. Maybe you want to consider supporting that mapper in your application.

You can make your own if you don't like these other ones much (that is why I wrote Famitile so you can write another one if you dislike 8tools and Famitile), but these others are also free and open source software. I may include the feature of automatically reducing and finding optimal palette in my program too if I know best algorithm so thank you.<br /><br />(About RGB palettes: Famitile has the default palette of VirtuaNES built-in, although perhaps it would be a good idea to allow RGB palettes to be loaded as well. I do not know if the 8tools nametable editor supports this, but the 8tools tile editor you can enter any RGB colors you want to. My suggestion for your program is perhaps include a default palette for NES and also allow loading custom RGB palettes.)

I picked a color that would caused alot of dithering artifacts on purpose even with all the artifacts it looks good when zoomed out all the way. Also thank you for the advice on how to work with an NES palette I never thought about using a palette file I thought about calculating the rgb values real time but using a file does seem like the better option. How would that work? How would my program know how to convert NES palette values to rgb values to the correct palette entry from the file?
