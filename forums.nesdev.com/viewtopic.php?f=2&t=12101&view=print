Perhaps there is improved version around?

If such a version exists I'd like to see it though.<br /><br />A while ago I did think of a couple ways to make the ray casting and the texturing a little faster (I'd basically reorganize the level maps so they're easier to read and turn some of the texturing math into more look-up tables), and since those steps are performed many times every frame that improvement should buy me enough CPU time to consider more features without having to sacrifice the frame rate much.<br /><br />What I want most is to add objects to the maze. I planned all the math for that already, but the low sprite limit of the NES will make drawing objects/enemies a real challenge. I can't use the background because all the possible texture, color and height combinations used up nearly all the tiles, so I can't possibly add another component to that mix. Enemies can probably be programmed to run away from you, so they never get too big, and static items could be limited to narrow objects. I'm confident that sprites can work, but I haven't thought of the perfect way to use them yet, so I don't have the motivation to go forward with this.<br /><br />Once objects are in, shooting would be extremely simple to implement. Then the only think missing for a Wolfenstein 3D lookalike is animated doors, which aren't exactly hard, but do interfere with the way rays are cast and distances are calculated.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">Anyway, seems like game I played except different textures and no real gameplay so...</div><br />The texture (yes, it's only one and it's stupid) in the YouTube video is outdated, the demo has better textures and dithering.

I tested both ways before making the NES version, and the reduced vertical resolution made it really hard to judge distances. Having to cast less rays also influenced this decision, and now I'm sure that it wouldn't be nearly as fast if I had to shoot twice as many rays.<br /><br />For objects, 2x2 pixels in a tile would probably work better.

This could be used for blinking lines, switches, things like that. I'd use a similar algorithm to the one that scales walls, but rendering sprites instead.

You need to check for transparent pixels, then read back from the already rendered map and override the pixels that are not transparent, then write back. <em>This</em> is where most of the time will go.

Blending walls with objects would be a nightmare. With sprites, transparency is free, and the only clipping necessary will consist in comparing the object distance to the distances of each wall stripe it overlaps, in order to decide whether to draw the sprites over that strip at all.<br /><br />I was considering designing sprites similar to the ones found in <a href="http://8bitcity.blogspot.com.br/search/label/rpg%20sprites" class="postlink">this page</a>, very low resolution and using very few colors (<a href="http://8bitcity.blogspot.com.br/2011/01/pixel-art-rpg-sprites.html" class="postlink">these</a> specifically appear to fit my requirements, but there are many other good examples). To draw them I would probably store as many 1bpp patterns as possible in the pattern tables, repeated 3 times (each using one of the non-transparent color indices), while also counting on flipping to reduce the tile count. I have to do the math in order to see how many pixels I could cram in each tile (or 2 tiles, if I use 8x16 sprites), but having 9 colors to draw objects should compensate the monochrome feel of the level a bit.<br /><br />The important thing when using sprites is to make sure the player can't get to close to wide objects, because I can only cover about 28% of the viewport with sprites.
