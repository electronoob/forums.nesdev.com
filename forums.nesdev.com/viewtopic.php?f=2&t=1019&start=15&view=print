Maybe the glitches to the right will be more evident if you do that? Why are you changing the emphasis bits in adition to the first palette entry? I don't think you get much benefit from doing that...

<br />
<br />I tried it, it didn't display properly for me.  The background colors seem to be flickering (like it's correct one frame, then a solid color the next).  I was gonna record a video, but everything looks horrible the way my NES is hooked up (toploader RF out -&gt; VCR -&gt; vidcap card) so the colors are hardly visible.  If it helps, I could record one anyways.
<br />
<br />But.. I had to hack the ROM to make it work on Squeedo (to make it load CHR-RAM).  I doubt that would've affected any timing though.
<br />
<br />To make a PAL version, you'd just have to change the timing.

If I would pick another color for the border tiles, the screen would be randomly turned off to spot the background color/or the indexed color, both are the color byte I cange. So with anything else horrible glitches would pop.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">I tried it, it didn't display properly for me.

If you would said glitches shows at the right differently that it does in Nintendulator or FCEU, I could understnad, but having the whole think flickering is really strange.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">But..

<br />Cool !
<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">To make a PAL version, you'd just have to change the timing.</div>
<br />Yeah, but is PAL timing favorable to this ? I think one CPU clock is 3.2 PPU clock instead of 3 making timing much more complex AND leve you less time to perform in a single scanline (even if this is compensated by more VBlank time, this doesn't help here). So I suspect a PAL adaptation to simply not be possible.

<br />
<br />It works now.  And I adjusted the controls on my vidcap card also so I could get a viewable picture.
