What happens is that on the composite PPU, these bits actually de-emphasize the other colors (i.e. blue emphasis actually darkens red and green to make the blue stand out), so when you set all 3 bits, all 3 colors are de-emphasized equally, making the image darker. On the RGB PPU however, the emphasis bits increase the color components all the way up (i.e. blue emphasis puts blue at the maximum value and doesn't affect the other components), so when you blow all of them up you get white.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">Sik wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">I think there's a game that uses this to make translucent water</div><br />From the top of my head, I can only think of <em>Noah's Ark</em>, which uses blue emphasis in combination with the grayscale bit to create the water effect. They could have used some sprites on the surface (like in the Sonic games - even the ones on the Master system &amp; Game Gear, which have the same sprite limitations as the NES - but I'm sure you know that <img src="./images/smilies/icon_lol.gif" alt=":lol:" title="Laughing" />) to make it look better though, that black line doesn't look anything like water.

The NES can't really do that.</div><br />The great majority of water levels in Sonic games rewrite the palette. The one exception I can think of is the beginning of Hydrocity Act 1 in Sonic 3, because of the &quot;water filling up the tunnel&quot; gimmick. As for the 8-bit games, I'm fairly sure Sonic 1 and 2 on the SMS/GG also didn't rewrite palettes, but Chaos, Triple Trouble and Blast did.<br /><br />Anyway, I was only questioning what Noah's Ark does for the surface of the water (black line?), what it does for the actual water is fine IMO (the grayscale bit makes the things look pretty bright though, but I understand that the blue emphasis alone without any sort of effect on the surface would have been too subtle), it doesn't need to rewrite the palette.

Yesterday I mentioned this to spikeman and handed him my progress.  Spikeman went into turbo spikeman mode and fixed the brightman stage.  According to the original author of this hack dr cossack stage 3 lower route also has color emphasis which it does in a playthrough video I found.  I'm unsure if our current fix also fixed cossack stage 3 I'm waiting for someone to play to that stage in fceux and make a savestate we can use for debugging.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />After using spikeman romhacking + game genie codes I got to the spot in cossack stage 3 with color emphasis.  I sent spikeman the savestate, he found the data, and it's changed.  I wound up changing the rising / falling water from emphasis to grayscale.  In the brightman stage the areas that you can't see are also changed from emphasis to grayscale.  I burned the rom, plugged it into my mmc5 devcart, runs great on my rgb twin.  I think this is done unless we find another part of the game that uses color emphasis.  The author of this romhack only mentioned these two stages.

If I find it, I have a video of a Famicom starting to act strange if I mash my palm on the underside of the PCB. It starts with the tint changing, the sync starting to waver, the jailbars becoming more pronounced, followed by usually a game crash, but occasionally just weird mis-writes that don't break it completely.
