<br />It's my understanding from talking to him , that his hoax game is done. a few glitches to clean up, but really it's ready to go.
<br />
<br />I hope he does release it so dur butter monster will live on. The real game has no butter monster <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I think it's quite normal for people acquiring rare/prototype/whatever carts to not release the dumped ROM immediately. Actually these cost money and maybe time and effort to locate the copies, so it isn't even wrong for the "collectors" to keep the games to themselves and not releasing the things. It's a good thing that this game is eventually available to the public, and I think this delay is quite understandable and releasing it on that ONE day is PERFECT time considering what has ever happened relating to it, whether the real game is crappy or not is irrelevant.

<br />So did I. It's a lot of talk for a little thing if you want my opinion.

When scrolling, it updates two rows/cols of tiles at a time, plus the row/col of attribute bytes. The game doesn't scroll faster than 15 pixels in any direction though.
<br />
<br />Still though, that's fast. :T

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Scrolling speed doesn't mean much IMO. With unrolled loops you can write a shitload of data to the PPU during VBlank, and decoding one more row/column of tiles from the level map isn't that complicated/slow either, considering that most games have a block size of 16x16 pixels, and once you reach those it doesn't make much difference whether you will read all 4 tiles or just 2.
<br />
<br />My game can scroll pretty fast, 16 pixels per frame both vertically and horizontally if necessary (updating a total of 128 bytes + attributes). If that happens every frame though there won't be a lot of VBlank time left for other updates, so palette and pattern animations might start to lag. But I doubt my camera will move that fast diagonally for several consecutive frames.
<br />
<br />I have to agree that not many NES games are as fast as Bio Force Ape, but I have no idea why. I really don't think the hardware imposes severe limitations on scrolling speed.

<br />Maybe not the hardware but the collision detection algorithm you are using.
<br />
<br />For example if you are running very fast in front of a very thin wall, chances are that the game could allow you to just go through it if you are scrolling too fast.
<br />
<br />Also, I don't find it "comfortable" to scroll too fast, as you can't see the level that is coming at you. No, I have never been a fan of sonic  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=":wink:" title="Wink" />
