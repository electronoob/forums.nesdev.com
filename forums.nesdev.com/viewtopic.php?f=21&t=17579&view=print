		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Color $22, most well known for the sky in Super Mario Bros, seems to be one of the most poorly represented colors in most emulators.  I have seen it be anything from a deep blue to light purple.  Most of the palettes/emulators claiming to be accurate show it as a bluish purple color.  If I plug my Nintendo into an LCD display, it shows $22 to be very close the purple color I see on the &quot;accurate&quot; palettes.  So I've sort of just assumed that the color is indeed slightly purple and I was just remembering it being more blue when I was a kid... But today I picked up a CRT from the early 2000s.. and boy that sky is undoubtedly BLUE, without any hint of purple!  I messed with the color settings and did get the more purple sky, but the rest of the colors seemed off when I did that. <br /><br />I've also noticed the the $x8 range tends to show up as a yellow-green color in &quot;accurate&quot; palettes as well as on my LCD display.  Using $38 for a sky color on my LCD looks like a kinda &quot;puke yellow&quot; color, but it looks great on the CRT, with the brighter shades like $38 and $28 being much more yellow/brown without green.. though the darker $08 is still slightly olive.  <br /><br />I have been working on updating a hack of mine, with one of the goals to update the color choices to look best on a real system with CRT while also looking good on emulators which have accurate palettes.  Up until now I've been using puNES and FCEUX with NTSC mode enabled since they seemed close to my LCD, but neither of them look like this CRT i picked up.. in fact some of my original color choices based on FCEUX's original completely non-accurate palette look better than the updated choices.  I know in the end it's up to the TV to decide how the colors are displayed, but it's maddening trying to pick the right colors, especially if you would like to use these colors which seem to be the most widely varied.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />My biggest problem with palette definitions is FCEUX misrepresenting colour $2D as a lot brighter than i've ever seen it on any tv. If you turn the contrast all the way down, you get something similar to fceux, but then every other colour is also affected by lack of contrast. Given that FCEUX is a very popular emulator, that's problematic for me since i like to use that colour for precicely that usage. <br /><br />I guess that since many developers stay away from the $xD column for compability issues with some fringe versions (playchoice, vs. system, famicom titler, and famicom tv), it hasn't been a priority. neslib even scrambles $xD into the $x0 column, which makes for a too bright glitch, since the both the  $x0 column has intentionally de-aligned brightness values compared to the other columns.<br /><br />Some thoughts on the OP colours:<br />It's not a full explanation, but part of it could be that hue is harder to discern for the human eye than brightness, and there is a lot of individual variance in the capability to distinguish hue. Since the blues and greens of the master palette are more finely represented (to the degree of sometimes almost being pointless) than reds and yellows, they are harder to distinguish, and by extension, represent. You can do it mathematically, but once you get into analog or optical territory, it gets hairy.<br /><br />In my experience, screens and CRT:s especially are swinging wildy in warm/cold balance from model to model. Even my HDTV is a lot warmer than my laptop and secondary computer screen. What falls into a cold green distinction to my eyes on the former may sometimes be jade or teal on the latter ones.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />It seems everybody has had this moment of connecting a NES to a real CRT, seeing a particular color looking more x-ish rather than y-ish and coming to think that those emulation people got it all wrong --- until they connect the same NES to a different CRT, and coming to realize how inherently variable and unstable the NES' color generation really is. There are just sooo many things going on:<ul><li>Even when black and white levels are perfectly normalized, almost all colors will be either clipped at black or at white because the NES outputs overly saturated colors in the first place (as a result of not originating as RGB in the first place)</li><li>Incorrect color burst and sync amplitudes, some of which are used by TV's automatic gain control for video signal normalization, yielding to brightness and contrast far and unpredictably different from ideal normalization, further changing what the effects of clipping will be.</li><li>CRT TVs clipping differently, at least at the upper bound, than digital displays. Simply put, CRT phosphors oversaturate rather than clip. Also, TV displays (CRT and LCD) typically are much brighter than computer monitors, so at a given mid-range setting, overly-bright video levels may not actually clip because there is still headroom upwards, while computer monitors always clip because there is no headroom.</li><li>Amplitude-dependent phase distortion from signal reflections due to poor impedance matching in the NES' video path. This is a general problem of the NTSC television system, but the NES is particularly badly affected. It depends on the electrical characteristics of the TV set, the cable type and length, the PPU and console model, and even the temperature. I've had the same console look different, with identical TV settings, at different times of the day. Not greatly so, but noticeably in the &quot;problem&quot; colors in the $x8 range.</li><li>NTSC TVs either assuming 7.5% or 0% black level setup, changing how much all colors (or at least the $0x ones) are clipped at the lower bound;</li><li>NTSC decoders using idiosyncratic coefficients to correct for the TV having non-NTSC phospors (i.e. every single TV after 1954), or not correcting at all;</li><li>Idiosyncratic user-adjusted Hue and Saturation.</li></ul><br />Color $22 is the one color most sensitive to video levels and consequently the amount and type of upper-bound clipping, while the $x8 colors are the colors most sensitive to amplitude-dependent phase distortion and the user-adjusted Hue setting.<br /><br />As for picking colors, I've found that picking shades only in the same phase column and thus not mixing e.g. $x7 with $x8 is generally a safe choice, and using the $3x colors for anything other than highlights is a bad choice (see Sky Kid, for example). I have often scratched my head at some games' color choices, until I realized that several of them must have been made to look good on the 2C03 RGB PPU rather than the home console. For example, SMB3 uses pinkish $36 as a highlight for $27, which looks ridiculous on the home console, but exactly right in the 2C03. For the home console, you would use $37 as a highlight for $27, which would look overly yellow on the 2C03.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />that's an interesting thought about developers developing on a different PPU than the one that was in most people's systems.. seems like that would cause all sorts of color problems.<br /><br />I still don't get why all the &quot;accurate&quot; palettes show $22 as much more purple than this CRT is showing it, and the yellow/brown $x8 column has almost no green in it on this CRT as well.  It's frustrating having such a wide range of colors from emulators to TVs.  I guess that's just part of NES graphic development, having to accept that the colors will not be the same on all systems.  It's hard to pick which one to be the &quot;definitive&quot; color set too, especially these days where most people are likely to play on an emulator.. 10 years ago it was easier, almost everyone used FCEUX, but now people use emulators, virtual consoles and &quot;NES classic&quot; emulator consoles, all of which also display things differently from the original console

As an LTI system, it could certainly adjust colors on edges, but there's really no way to cause &quot;differential phase&quot; distortion without a powered stage (e.g. clipping in the amplifier, as in early NTSC broadcasting stations; or a voltage-dependent resistance as in the 2C02's analog output).<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">Even if the explanation may be incorrect, the observation is not.<br /></div>It would be nice if we actually had multiple different documented complete A/V paths.<br /><br />In writing my previous reply, I noticed that the A/V path as drawn <a href="https://console5.com/wiki/File:NES-001-Schematic---Power,-AV,-RF-Switch.png" class="postlink">here</a> doesn't agree with the fragment I reverse-engineered <a href="https://forums.nesdev.com/viewtopic.php?p=131845#p131845" class="postlink">here</a>...

The higher the gain at this stage, the better the emitter-follower is at isolating the variable resistance out of the 2C02's video output.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Reflections themselves may not cause differential phase distortion. But different reflections can cause differently-spaced comb filtering, which will cause different cancellations of original signal components, in turn causing different changes in amplitude, causing different phase distortion in any powered stage on the part of the TV set that displays the signal.<br /><br />The AN-500B is stable across all TVs, capture cards, cables and sockets that I have tried. The AN-505BK is stable with the capture card, but highly variable when connected to several different Sony TVs. The same Sony TVs show stable colors with other home computers and consoles.<br /><br />In other words, both the AN-505BK and all my Sony TVs have some kind of electrical characteristic that only together cause phase distortion beyond what I described in that palette thread. I don't know how to measure the impedance of any input or output, but from what I have read, it's not as simple as holding an Ohmmeter to it.

(Transmission lines are low-pass filters made of an infinite series of inductances and capacitances. In practice, the low-pass corner frequency is quite high, usually at least 1GHz)<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">&quot;phase distortion&quot;<br /></div>It is very important in the NTSC context that this is <strong>differential</strong> phase distortion—that some correlated property causes a variation in the amount of phase distortion.
