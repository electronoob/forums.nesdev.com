		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Can someone help me generate a decent ghostbusters yell pcm audio to replace the original nes version? I'm in the process of hacking this game and I thought it would be cool to have that yell replaced with one of the yells from the official song. There is a version of that song with vocals only and I've isolated one of the yells in .wav format, but I'm having a hard time generating a decent pcm file. Maybe the game's code for this is bad too?<br /><br />I tried famitracker and NESPCM but the game plays a screeching sound along with the yell. The game has $94E bytes reserved for this sample, and it isn't aligned, but somehow it works. The smaller the new sound the better so I can insert more code for the ending, etc. Ultimately if it can't sound good I'd just remove it altogether for the free space, but I was hoping to keep the feature...<br /><br />The original sample is located at 0x3DC2-0x470F.<br />The JSR that plays the sample is at 0x331C.<br />I think you can adjust playback rate by editting the 0x3343 byte.<br /><br />I have looked into tutorials and examples (there aren't many), and honestly it all sounds like alien language to me. pseudo explanation: &quot;Hey, just do 1-bit downsample every other 4 bytes from deamplified 33 hz raw riff wav, how hard can it be?&quot;. I totally don't get it.  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_cry.gif" alt=":cry:" title="Crying or Very sad" /><br /><br />The routine that reads the sample:<br /><br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">ghostbussteerrs:<br />&nbsp;00:B30C:A9 FF&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;LDA #$FF<br />&nbsp;00:B30E:8D 15 40&nbsp; STA $4015 = #$00<br />&nbsp;00:B311:A9 B2&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;LDA #$B2<br />&nbsp;00:B313:85 F0&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;STA $00F0 = #$00<br />&nbsp;00:B315:A9 BD&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;LDA #$BD<br />&nbsp;00:B317:85 F1&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;STA $00F1 = #$00<br />&nbsp;00:B319:A0 00&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;LDY #$00<br />pcm_loop1:<br />&nbsp;00:B31B:B1 F0&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;LDA ($F0),Y @ $BDB2 = #$77<br />&nbsp;00:B31D:29 0F&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;AND #$0F<br />&nbsp;00:B31F:0A&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ASL<br />&nbsp;00:B320:0A&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ASL<br />&nbsp;00:B321:0A&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ASL<br />&nbsp;00:B322:8D 11 40&nbsp; STA $4011 = #$00<br />&nbsp;00:B325:A2 68&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;LDX #$68&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;; you can adjust this to change rate?<br />pcm_loop2:<br />&nbsp;00:B327:CA&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; DEX<br />&nbsp;00:B328:D0 FD&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;BNE pcm_loop2<br />&nbsp;00:B32A:B1 F0&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;LDA ($F0),Y @ $BDB2 = #$77<br />&nbsp;00:B32C:29 F0&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;AND #$F0<br />&nbsp;00:B32E:4A&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; LSR<br />&nbsp;00:B32F:8D 11 40&nbsp; STA $4011 = #$00<br />&nbsp;00:B332:A2 65&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;LDX #$65&nbsp; &nbsp; ; this can also be adjusted<br />pcm_loop3:<br />&nbsp;00:B334:CA&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; DEX<br />&nbsp;00:B335:D0 FD&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;BNE pcm_loop3<br />&nbsp;00:B337:E6 F0&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;INC $00F0 = #$00<br />&nbsp;00:B339:D0 E0&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;BNE pcm_loop1<br />&nbsp;00:B33B:E6 F1&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;INC $00F1 = #$00<br />&nbsp;00:B33D:A9 C7&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;LDA #$C7&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;; this determines how long the sample is to be read from the rom<br />&nbsp;00:B33F:C5 F1&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;CMP $00F1 = #$00<br />&nbsp;00:B341:D0 D8&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;BNE pcm_loop1<br />&nbsp;00:B343:60&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; RTS -----------------------------------------</div><br /><br />I don't totally understand it, but looking at some PCM asm examples, it seems like once you start playing it goes automatically, but this routine is constantly resetting the thing for each byte read?

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />The original PCM sample (I've looked at it) is unsigned 4-bit, little-endian. It plays at a very low frequency (between 3 and 4 khz), which is probably much of why it sounds so bad. Part of the sample isn't played at the end, which has a click sound, which is why it sounds like &quot;Ghostbuster&quot;. Hope that helps.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />@SuperWill24:<br />So, you feel like in this little space ($94E bytes) there wouldn't be a chance to make a better sounding PCM?<br /><br />@tepples:<br />There's $77D unused bytes on the PRG (scattered throughout), and I need to add some code still for the ending.<br />On the CHR that is &quot;loaded&quot; at the title screen there are just a handful of free tiles, but when it goes to the disclaimer it changes CHR, so the start button can be pressed on either time. Do you think it could be loaded from CHR? In this case the screen would need to go blank and switch to the appropriate one when playing the sound. If this is possible I'm ok with this solution. edit: just checked, the CHR has just $600 bytes free, I thought it'd be more. That's not much help.<br /><br />As a principle I didn't really want to extend the rom or change mappers, I just want to do the best I could with exactly the same tech as the original game.<br /><br />The music though I haven't touched yet, and it uses 3 kilobytes (it's a 3 minutes long song). It could be rewritten to optimize and reuse modular sections that are looped. As it is they are just copied over many times. This could free up space. This will be a lot of work, and I'm leaving it for later.

How would I go about making it so?</div><br /><br />If I recall correctly, tepples's 81.exe converter converts to the NES 1-bit DPCM format, not 4-bit unsigned. Here's my method to convert:<br /><br />1. Open the wav file in Audacity (or any other sufficient audio editor). Resample to the frequency to whatever extremely low frequency the game uses, and make sure it's mono as well.<br />2. Export to a RAW file. In Audacity, set the type to &quot;Other uncompressed files&quot; and then go &quot;Options&quot; and set the properties to &quot;Raw (headerless)&quot; and the encoding to &quot;Unsigned 8-bit PCM&quot;.<br />3. Run the attached program through DOSBox to convert the raw sample file you have to a 4-bit PCM file (it has the extension .GBW in this program).<br />4. However, the resulting file is big-endian, not little-endian, so you'll need to byteswap the file so it can be little-endian. I am not sure which program can do this.<br />5. Replace the original sample with the resulting new sample.<br /><br />I'm also kind of glad to see a topic like this appear, since currently I've been interested in sample ripping from old consoles like the NES.

Could by any chance the code that reads the data be changed to accept big endian instead?<br />In our 4-bit case does this mean that for every byte the order of each 4 bits group must be inversed?<br /><br />@Sumez: I thought dpcm and pcm were the same thing, I'm sure I read somewhere in these forums that they are just names for the same thing. They aren't?

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />DPCM means &quot;differential pulse code modulation&quot; because it stores the <em>difference</em> between one sample and the next. Sometimes it's referred to as &quot;delta pulse code modulation&quot; using a Greek letter Δ that often means difference between adjacent values in a sequence. In the NES scene, unqualified DPCM has a very specific meaning: the format accepted by the <a href="http://wiki.nesdev.com/w/index.php/APU_DMC" class="postlink">APU's waveform playback unit</a> at $4010-$4013, a 1-bit little-endian DPCM with a 64-step range.
