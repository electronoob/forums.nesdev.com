<br /><!-- w --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.nescity.com">www.nescity.com</a><!-- w --> (taken offline)
<br />
<br />But I was wanting to know if anyone had any technical advice or websites relating to creating multiple ROMs into ONE single Cartridge for the N.E.S. 
<br />I also wonder, If I download NES ROMs from a particular website, how could I copy the "code" into a particular cartridge and make the game play more than one game?
<br />
<br />Id like to add the fallowing:
<br />
<br />1. Faxanadu (English by HudsonSoft)
<br />2: Castlevania 1,2,&amp;3 (Capcom?)
<br />3: Excitebike
<br />
<br />Any advice would be most helpful.

<br />
<br />And have you considered developing your own NES software too?

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Im not one to brag but just recentley I had a roommate move out on me and my playstation2 was stolen with over 30 games. After he moved out I was going through some of the garbage he was so kind enough to leave behind and found an N.E.S., It didnt have the AC Adapter, nor did it have any controllers nor did it have the UHF/VHF connector(whatever its called) But I had a box full of some old games(I had them in my attic, they were so negelected  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_cry.gif" alt=":cry:" title="Crying or Very sad" /> )
<br />
<br />So I stoled it from him. One mans trash is anothers treasure.
<br />
<br />I have the old school paddles and one which is rather large and has the arcade joystick, and big red buttons. I took the big controller apart due to it being as dirty as it was to attempt to clean it. A friend I know who works at a local electronic store had given me a few ideas to recreate the "Arcade feel" of the old TenGen games. Im currently developing a NES/SNES Emulator for Linux &amp; Windows platforms, I will post my website URL in my profile once the CSS &amp; XHTML is cmplete, I just need to think of a good layout.
<br />
<br />Thank you for your kind reply, I didnt want to sound like a twit, I knew it would be a tad more complicated than a simple "Cut &amp; Paste" operation if you know what I mean.

<br />
<br />Otherwise you'll have to code a menu and hack the games, is that what you were planning on doing already?

I wanted to know if I downloaded some ROMs from a website where you can play them in a emulator such as FCE Ultra, if I could find a way of putting them all into one NES Cart. either this or just recreate Faxanadu by Hudsonsoft, its an old school favorite of mine and i was wanting to recreate it and perhaps make a better version.
<br />
<br />So yea, id "hack" it, but I have no idea where to start.

<br /><a href="http://www.parodius.com/~veilleux/boardtable.txt" class="postlink">http://www.parodius.com/~veilleux/boardtable.txt</a>
<br /><a href="http://www.parodius.com/~veilleux/boardnames" class="postlink">http://www.parodius.com/~veilleux/boardnames</a>
<br />
<br />Then burn (or have someone burn for you) an EPROM with the code on it.  The board will need to be rewired like the docs in the 'cart hardware' section of this site show.
<br />
<br />As for hacking the game to change stuff in it, if there's not any tools like a level editor already you'll have to reverse-engineer it.  By disassembling the code in the ROM and seeing how it works.
<br />
<br />For hacking a game to put several one on cart, if they use different cart hardware it's probably cheaper/easier to buy the games individually (unless you have tons of free time).  Some games would be impossible to hack that way, the hardware on various carts can be vastly different.
