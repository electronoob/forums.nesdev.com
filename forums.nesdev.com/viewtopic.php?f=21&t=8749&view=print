		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Looks good, but with up to 5 sprites in some scanlines the flickering will be intense! I usually allow myself to use up to 4 sprites horizontally per character/object, so that I can show at least 2 of them in the same scanlines without flickering. I do make exceptions for a couple of animation frames here and there, but only when extremely necessary.
<br />
<br />The game I linked to looks pretty decent, and the sprites are a bit more cartoony (with outlines and flat colored areas), which might look better than pre-rendered 3D on the NES.
<br />
<br />Your style is interesting though, I wonder what a full screen mock-up would look like.

<br />
<br />The GBC has considerably more colors and more palettes than the NES, so it definitely has the potential for better looking ports. However, many GBC developers didn't make good use of the resources, for whatever reason.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />DKC on GBC is a really lazy port that obviously recycled the DKL engine with new elements that don't work.  For example, the DKL games didn't have you jumping onto moving ropes, but DKC-GBC does, and if you try to roll jump onto a moving rope that is moving away from you,  the character rolls through it!
<br />
<br />Not to mention the control just feels loose in general.  You're barely able to ride a rolling metal keg which was <a href="http://dkbarrelroll.ytmnd.com/" class="postlink">easy enough on the SNES</a>.

<br />
<br />As for this page: In DKC, the player can toss barrels and they roll. Metal kegs are like barrels that bounce off walls, and the player can toss one and jump on it to ride it. The image is a demonstration of riding a keg, combined with a <a href="http://wiki.ytmnd.com/Barrel_Roll" class="postlink">meme from Star Fox 64</a>.

It's weird how they used wide pixels (like the pixels on the Commodore 64) for the background... maybe this was a cheap way to compress tiles to half their size, since it uses CHR-RAM (a quick look in a tile editor reveals some uncompressed low-resolution tiles though, so I'm not sure about this).<br /><br />IMO, you should consider the developer of the game. Since the SNES DKC games were made by Rare, it's reasonable to assume that the NES version would also be made by them. One of their most famous games on the NES is Battletoads, which has detailed backgrounds and large, colorful sprites. They even overlaid sprites in order to make them look more colorful and give them more volume. They also went out of their way to implement all sorts of background effects, such as animation and parallax scrolling.<br /><br />So, considering the history of the company developing the game, I imagine that a Donkey Kong Country developed by Rare for the NES would look nothing like this ugly Conan game, which has dull backgrounds and flat monochrome sprites. Tho only good thing about it are the smooth animations, but DKC doesn't need them THAT smooth.
