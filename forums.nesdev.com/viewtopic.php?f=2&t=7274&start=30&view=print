After having a look at ASM6 source code I think I like the look of P65 better and the feature set is comparable.

<br />The only thing that bugs me about P65 is it's macro implementation.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I vote ASM6 because it's at least equally easy to use as NESASM and without the various hiccups of it. With Tokumaru's templates <!-- l --><a class="postlink-local" href="http://forums.nesdev.com/viewtopic.php?t=6160">viewtopic.php?t=6160</a><!-- l --> it's very fast to start off with and have a working ROM. And with Ben Samples' iNES macros <!-- l --><a class="postlink-local" href="http://forums.nesdev.com/viewtopic.php?t=6990">viewtopic.php?t=6990</a><!-- l --> the iNES header can be written in a more readable manner if that's a problem. I also like that ASM6 is, <s>unlike NESASM</s>, a generic 6502 assembler and doesn't necessarily lock you to NES/Famicom development. <strong>Edit:</strong> NESASM is apparently not locked to NES/Famicom either.<br /><br />The fact that it doesn't have as many functions as ca65 is not a problem for a beginner like me. I'd rather type 6502 code than mess with lots of assembler specific things. And wouldn't the code be more complicated to read if it has too much assembler specific words and stuff? I wouldn't mind trying out ca65 when I get more experienced though.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />One of the complains I often see about the cc65 suite assembler is that it requires alot of configuration for something simple. Well, configuration is power, but if you want something very simple and dumb, you can do it simply and forget about those linker scripts if you want to. That is, you can turn (use) cl65 as a <em>dumb</em> assembler.<br /><br />Take that for example, I wanted to hack a NSF to study its inner workings, so I used da65 to do so, and with the time I made an good infofile to better instruct the disassembler and separate code and data. When the time to hack the NSF came, I was too lazy to even consider making a linker script for that, it was a rather simple NSF with no bankswitching that loaded into $C000. I tried:<div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">cl65 --target none --start-addr $BF80 disasm.s -o test.nsf<br /></div> (the start address is $C000 - $80 (size of NSF header)), but apparently cl65 doesn't like hexadecimal constants in the command line, but I was <em>really</em> lazy as fuq and so I used since then the following in a tiny script&#058;<div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">cl65 --target none --start-addr $(printf %d 0xBF80) disasm.s -o test.nsf<br /></div><br />I didn't even see the need to use ASM6 or something else for that, cl65 can be as dumb as you want to.

Just need to be aware of some things that are different in ca65 than in most other assemblers, e.g. .org doesn't pad the output to the new .org address, it just sets the internal &quot;program counter&quot;.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />It seems that <tt style="margin-left: 2px; margin-right: 2px; padding:3px; background-color: #3355aa; color: white;">ORG</tt> means different things in different assemblers. In ASM6, it pads the output. In MagicKit, only the low thirteen bits are used to set the offset into the output file, but all sixteen bits are used for labels and so on. (In Unofficial MagicKit, it is possible to use a postprocessor to relocate them, but this is not possible in the standard MagicKit.)<br /><br />I read about macros in P65; I do not particularly like that way either (although it does suggest you can use a C preprocessor if you want textual macros). (In Unofficial MagicKit, you can use the <tt style="margin-left: 2px; margin-right: 2px; padding:3px; background-color: #3355aa; color: white;">ASSIGN</tt> and/or <tt style="margin-left: 2px; margin-right: 2px; padding:3px; background-color: #3355aa; color: white;">MACSET</tt> command to imitate &quot;binding&quot; of macro parameters.) Macros work in another different way in ACME; it accepts call-by-value and call-by-reference, although not quite like C macros or like MagicKit macros.<br /><br />It is, in fact, possible to tell NESASM/MagicKit not to output a header, and it does in fact allow generic 6502 development; it isn't actually limited to NES/Famicom (although it is one of the two systems it has built-in support for; the other is PC-Engine, although I don't know anything about PC-Engine programming).<br /><br />About passing hexadecimal numbers on the command-line for cl65, I did expect that using C syntax might work since if it is using strtol() then it would accept it (if you don't tell it what base the numbers are in, it will figure out by itself using the prefix).<br /><br />IFDEFs, locally defined labels, and anonymous labels are all supported in MagicKit too (the last one only in Unofficial MagicKit), although none of these are features I find useful for my own uses. I prefer to put everything in one ASM file, with exception of data produced by external programs, if there is any (sometimes there isn't any).<br /><br />MagicKit (including the features I have added) is what fits my style of programming, so that is what I use. (Most people probably have no use for the postprocessor VM, and would rarely use the advanced macros it supports, but I find these features to be very useful.) Another feature I like is explicit zero-page addressing.<br /><br />For anyone who does like some features of NESASM but think it lacks some features or has some bugs, you may want to consider to look at my version of NESASM, which adds some things (described elsewhere on the forum) which you may or may not find useful.
