		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Hello all. To help me learn more about the SNES, how all the components are connected together, and how they interact with one another, I thought I would go ahead and create a schematic of the system's PCB. The couple that are <a href="http://www.caitsith2.com/snes/snes%20schematic.rar" class="postlink">currently</a> <a href="http://neviksti.com/wiki/Schematics" class="postlink">available</a> are pretty horrible. It's also helping me learn how to use the schematic capture software that I have. Would anyone find this useful or think it would be good to post? Or not really? Maybe there are some much better schematics that already exist that I just don't know about? If someone thinks it has value then where would be a good place to post it?<br /><br />I've only just started, but <a href="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/36237540/SNES/jwdonal/schematics/snes_schematic_progress1.png" class="postlink">here</a> is a screenshot. The screenshot isn't legible just because it's zoomed out so far, but the actual schematic when printed to PDF (or whatever) is ultra-high resolution.<br /><br />I am having to manually create all the nintendo custom components and having to define each individual pin so it's taking a while and is pretty tedious. But I have definitely learned a lot even with the little that I've done so far - so it's worth it.<br /><br />Also, _major_ credit to the nocash's <a href="http://nocash.emubase.de/fullsnes.htm" class="postlink">fullsnes</a> doc. It has been invaluable for getting all of the component pinouts, signal names, and pin numbers.<br /><br />--<br /><br />EDIT: Schematics are complete. If you're just looking for SNES schematics and don't want to read through the entire thread to find the link, here it is: <a href="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/36237540/SNES/jwdonal/schematics/snes_schematic.zip" class="postlink">https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/36237540/SNES/jwdonal/schematics/snes_schematic.zip</a>

The one that moved the S-DSP and S-SMP chips from the separate SHVC-SOUND daughter board to the mother board?  There is also the third revision which replaced the audio processing components with the S-APU single chip - I'm not interested in that one (since it has less behavioral detail).

It's from the killer instinct bundle, and it actually has really bad video quality, it's got really bad jailbars.  I know the PCB layout is different because the video encoder is actually placed in the top right corner (looking at the snes from the front).  On previous revisions it's in the bottom right.

What do you think the PCB difference would have been between those revisions?  The PCB in the picture you're showing is what I have described in revision 3, that is, it still has all the chips separate except for the single-chip APU.

I'm not sure if there was any additions or removals of actual components, but they were definitely moved around.<br /><br />But there is definitely noticable degradation in video quality.  It's absolutely terrible, and this is in comparison to some SFC's I've owned with vertical bars and jailbars.  This has by far the worst picture of any SNES I've ever seen.
