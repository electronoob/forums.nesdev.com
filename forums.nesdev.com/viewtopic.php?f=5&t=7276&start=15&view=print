		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />GCC has a feature analogous to lint (-Wall); adding such a checker to ca65 should ideally qualify. If organized education fails to recognize that a solution that builds on an existing <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_software" class="postlink">free software</a> product is just as valid as a solution from scratch, that'd explain a lot of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Not_Invented_Here" class="postlink">NIH syndrome</a> I've seen. (For more about NIH, see my previous post discussing <a href="http://nesdev.com/bbs/viewtopic.php?p=67791#67791" class="postlink">definitions of plagiarism</a>.) Are these IB criteria a trade secret?
<br />
<br />As for your second question, almost every assembler feature that I've needed I've been able to implement as a preprocessor. See for example my source code shuffler written in Python (<a href="http://www.pineight.com/croom" class="postlink">implementation</a> and <a href="http://nesdev.com/bbs/viewtopic.php?t=6197" class="postlink">discussion</a>), intended to help discover buffer overflows and to help trace leaked binaries.
<br />
<br />I'd like to see a 6502/65816 assembler that supports the very 6502-like SPC700 instruction set with the same feature set that ca65 provides to 6502, 65C02, and 65816.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />As it were, IB CS forces students to use Java. Now I'm not 100% certain, but I've got $20 saying the ca65 is not written in Java.
<br />
<br />For the curious, the criteria are as follows:
<br />
<br />1) Arrays
<br />2) User-Defined Objects
<br />3) Objects As Data Records
<br />4) Simple Selection (if-else)
<br />5) Complex Selection (nested if, if with multiple conditions, or switch)
<br />6) Loops
<br />7) Nested Loops
<br />8.) User-Defined Methods
<br />9) User-Defined Methods w/ Parameters
<br />10) User-Defined Methods w/ Return Values
<br />11) Sorting
<br />12) Searching
<br />13) Binary File I/O
<br />14) Use Of External Libraries
<br />15) Use Of Sentinels/Flags
<br />
<br />Personally I think the whole IB CS thing is a load of shie√üe. Had I known what I was getting into with this class, I would have not taken it. To give you an indication of the level of mastery my teacher has, he once told the class you could concatenate two chars into a String in 'System.out.println()' by separating them with a comma.
<br />
<br />I told him to compile this:
<br />
<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">public class Bull &#123;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;public static void main&#40;String&#91;&#93; args&#41; &#123;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;System.out.println&#40;'B', 'S'&#41;;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&#125;<br />&#125;</div>

<br />Then add a new directive .incdpcm that takes a .wav file (binary), encodes it to DPCM, and spits out a huge block of .byt statements. I did something similar for the GBAdev community when the GNU assembler didn't have .incbin.

<br />
<br />Its not so much the teacher so much as it is the IB program and their rules on what you have to do to prove you have 'mastery' over the language. I originally was gonna write this in C++ and just use JNI to put it in a Java shell but anything that isn't written in Java is not taken into consideration for the 'mastery' portion.

<br />Yeah, something along the lines of <a href="http://www.atariage.com/forums/forum/65-batari-basic/" class="postlink">batari Basic</a>. A lot of people who had no clue about programming are making Atari 2600 games with it (and some are actually good!), and that's a system that's not particularly easy to code for, specially when you are completely oblivious to programming. It abstracts all the hardcore stuff such as screen-drawing kernels (by providing a set of general-purpose built-in kernels) and leaves just the game logic itself and the art for the programmer.
<br />
<br />The equivalent of that on the NES would be to radically facilitate video and audio generation. For example, the programmer would interact with the name tables through an array, without ever having to worry about VBlank and NMIs. Behind the scenes, your framework would delay all such updates so that they were performed at the correct times, but the user doesn't have to care about that.
