Your idea would prevent the stack from growing infinitely like it does in some cases, though.  On top of that, I would need to try and detect when RTS is used as a way to perform a jump to another subroutine (e.g after pushing the address on the stack), and replace the top of the callstack with the new location after the RTS is executed.  Overall it can probably be improved by a few things like this, though I don't think it'll ever be &quot;perfect&quot;.  I'll try to tinker some more with it when I get a chance.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />FCEUX's hex editor only commits when the full byte is written, but the difference there is that it's not possible to ever select just the low nybble, so that does make the interface problem harder. I'd be happy for an option to sacrifice low-nybble selection if it made the write committing make more sense; I usually want to select the high nybble, anyway, and get the low nybble by accident because I'm not used to it and it has a larger size (since it includes the space between bytes).<br /><br />Regarding the call stack, the issue in Zelda is that it uses JSR to pass the address of jump tables to an indirect jump function (JSR to function, PLA PLA to get the table address, JMP ($xx) to use the entry from the table). This is done all over the code. Coming from FCEUX, I'm used to just looking at the stack for return addresses rather than having a call stack feature, but with how small Mesen's stack view is (only 3-4 bytes visible at a time vs 20+ in FCEUX), it doesn't seem that practical to use in this manner. Given that, any improvements you may make to the call stack would be very welcome.<br /><br />I think I'm finally about out of feedback, at least for now. Thanks for all the work you've put into this!

Also, one could cherry-pick variables to watch for cheats whilst one is playing, which would probably make TASers very happy!<br /><br />Finally, in the long term it would be cool to merge such an emulator with an actual assembler, barring the need to manually compile code each time and allowing one to immediatly spot the differences a change in the source has on the actual game... but maybe this just-in-time assembly is still a bit to much too futuristic.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I've done some improvements to the callstack, it seems to be able to handle Zelda &amp; MM1 properly now.  Essentially, when it hits a RTS/RTI instruction, if the previous callstack info doesn't match the CPU's stack, it will try to find a matching callstack line &amp; remove all the lines above it.  If it can't find a matching line, it will add a new line to the callstack instead (and assume the code pushed an address to the stack and then called RTS to jump to it).  Hopefully this takes care of most games - let me know if you still find issues with it.<br /><br />I also changed the stack display to show more bytes (should show up to about 10 bytes now, instead of ~4) and fixed a bug that was causing it to display an extra byte in the list that wasn't supposed to be shown.<br /><br />The build also has some fixes I mentioned earlier (e.g step out), some more improvements based on rainwarrior's feedback in the Mesen thread (customizable font, a few new buttons/options, a new pause icon for when the debugger is opened), and should also improveme emulation performance  when debugging tools are opened by about 60-70% (on the windows build).<br /><br />Build: <a href="https://www.mesen.ca/MesenMar5.zip" class="postlink">download</a><br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">Yvar de Goffau wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"> a shame I can't get OSX to run mono!</div>I wish it was easier for me to try and make Mesen work on OSX - it's fairly likely it could be made to work without that much effort, unfortunately I don't own a Mac, and it sounds like trying to make OSX work in a VM would be a bit of a pain (plus I think you technically need to buy a Mac to have a license to use OSX?).<br /><br />There is a way to highlight uninitialized variables at the moment (but it requires that the debugger be attached from the ROM's power on), but no way to break on them.  Uninitialized memory is definitely one of the most common issues with homebrew though, so it might be worth trying to improve this a bit.<br />Cherry-picking variables to watch them can technically be done with the watch window, although it might be a little less &quot;advanced&quot; in some aspects to FCEUX's memory viewer (if that's what it was called).<br /><br />It's already technically possible to edit code in PRG ROM with the built-in assembler, but I understand what you mean.  What you're asking for would be essentially the same &quot;Edit-and-Continue&quot; in Visual Studio... and that feature doesn't work properly half the time in my experience, so I'm pretty confident it would be pretty hard/impossible to get it to work properly in this case :p

Overriding antitrust/etc. laws might be in effect depending on where you live. (Practically speaking, though, it won't really matter either way, because this part of the EULA isn't actually enforced in any meaningful way.)<br /><br />I've run a few versions of OS X in VirtualBox, and they work well enough. Even was compiling code with XCode on one of them. Haven't tried more recent versions of the OS but there weren't really any notable problems except the usual low performance of a VM.

I've been having to fall back on FCEUX when doing this.<br />- When setting a breakpoint, it would be much more convenient if the textbox for 'Specific' address were selected by default so one could just type an address and hit enter, rather than having to first click in the box.<br />- Using ctrl or shift with the mouse to select multiple addresses in the breakpoints section doesn't behave properly; rather than highlighting multiple entries, it toggles the current breakpoint. Shift with the arrow keys works correctly, however.<br />- The &quot;Bring debugger to front on break&quot; option unexpectedly applies to loading saved states.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />The saved state behavior seems to only happen when the emulator is paused. I have the emulator paused (with Escape) and press an F key to load a state, and the debugger comes to the front if the the &quot;Bring debugger to front on break&quot; option is selected. Apologies for the incomplete report before; I'm frequently paused when using saved states for development and didn't realize the behavior differed when not paused.<br /><br />The crash issue is fixed, the copy feature seems to work great, and I'll give the rest of it a try another night. Thanks for the update!<br /><br /><br />Edit:<br />I've encountered a few problems with the March 6 version:<br /><br />- The callstack seems much improved, but it doesn't correctly handle Step Back in Zelda.<br />- Step Back seems to not be working properly and I'm not sure exactly what's going on. In Zelda, if I set a write breakpoint on $EC (next_screen) and walk off the edge of a screen, the breakpoint correctly triggers at Bank5_B53A. In order to change the value being written, I use Step Back and Step Into to get to the start of the instruction and then set A to my desired value. In this version, instead of taking me to Bank5_B538, Step Back (almost always) takes me to Bank5_83E6. The PPU state is 3 cycles earlier on the same scanline, but the code it's at is actually later in the same frame. This reproduces fairly consistently for me, but I had one instance where it worked properly and I'm not sure what I did differently that time.<br />- When opening the debugger, the checkboxes for inactive breakpoints aren't drawn.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />So, I got around to trying out my hacked version of Years Behind debugwrite-hack (i.e. replacing the scroll register writes with setting/clearing the monochrome bit) on my PAL NES.<br /><br />Like I remembered, the timing is about as vertical as can be - perhaps being just *slightly* off for one or two playback rates. Here's a video capture of the DMC-enabled tunes: <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1JVvSYFIShNs_zHKjv7CJBRKsBdD9SCcr" class="postlink">https://drive.google.com/open?id=1JVvSYFIShNs_zHKjv7CJBRKsBdD9SCcr</a><br /><br />The purple vertical bars bounces around in a chaotic way and gets a bit wobbly, so it's not obvious at first. But doing a closer comparison in an emulator clearly shows way less skew than what Mesen - and FCEUX/Nintendulator - end up with. <br /><br />So yeah, it does look like our understanding of the PAL version of the DMC DMA is incomplete, and no emulator seems to emulate PAL DMC DMA timings correctly. Given that the PAL DMC fixed the hardware bug causing incorrect controller reads, it's not unlikely that the rule for how many cycles to pause could be very different from the NTSC version.<br /><br />Not sure what would be the best way to get the true values. But re-visiting the DMA tests that Blargg/cpow/Disch have done is probably a good starting point...

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Some more fixes/additions:<br />-Debugger shortcuts can now be customized in Options-&gt;Configure Shortcut Keys (but they are limited to keyboard shortcuts, gamepads will not work).  This includes a &quot;Toggle Break/Continue&quot; shortcut to mimic the &quot;Pause/Play&quot; behavior on the main window - both are mapped to Esc by default.  If there's any toggle/action that doesn't have a shortcut binding let me know and I can add one.  Hopefully this takes care of a number of usability issues with the debugger.<br /><br />-Added a &quot;byte editing mode&quot; to the hex editor that will only &quot;commit&quot; a change once both nibbles are written (enabling this disables the ability to select the lower nibble by clicking)<br />-Fixed a bug with the step back code - when stepping back, the emulator rewinds X number of frames and plays them back, pausing when it reaches the previous statement.  There was a bug that caused all buttons to be considered as unpressed when replaying the very last frame before pausing, which could cause the execution to diverge and end up breaking on the wrong line.<br />-Loading a state while the debugger is paused will no longer bring the debugger to the front when &quot;bring to front on break&quot; is enabled<br /><br />About step back vs the call stack, currently the rewinder has no knowledge of the call stack - so while it rewinds, it affects the callstack like if it was executing normally. I can probably fix it, but it'll take some effort, I'll keep it in my notes.<br /><br />For the inactive breakpoints not showing up properly, could you post a screenshot of what you mean?
