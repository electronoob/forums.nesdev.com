For me electrical damage has been a reality.<br /></div><br />Maybe it depends on the manufacturer then ?<br /><br />Personally I never really understood the difference between flash and EEPROM, except that Flash needs a charge pump while EEPROM does not (or does it ?). EEPROM is also more expensive for some reason (more reliable ?) and comes usually in smaller sizes.<br />I think some GBA games saves with Flash and some other with EEPROM. This would be a good comparaison which one is the best and all (when it comes to acess times and all). I remember both Golden Sun games took an incredibly long time to save. There is also GBA games with SRAM+battery, but this time it is something completely different (aka Fire Emblem and permanent saves).<br /><br />I also heard there is both EEPROM and Flash based PlayStation memory cards, is this true ? I bet the old ones are EEPROM (PS1) while the new ones are Flash (PS2) ? If so does they have the same acess time ? I don't have my PS1 any longer so I cannot exactly test this myself.<br /><br />And yes, it would somewhat rock to have a PC with 100% silicon memory storage BUT the main beef with Flash is that it can be erased/overwritten typical 10'000 times, which is enormous for most standard electronical applications, but isn't that much when it comes to replacing a hard disk. Also, acess times would be faster on reads and about the same on writes, so it would definitely be worth it. Nothing beats the acess times of old 5' floppy diks, though. (maybe cassetes on the C64 was the worst after all)<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=38">Bregalad</a> — Sun Oct 07, 2007 12:06 pm</p><hr />

Magnetic media is the sole reason we have the "backup copy" laws we do because magnetic media is prone to degradation over time no matter how you store it (spare maybe some über ridiculous vacuum chamber of magic or something).  As far as I know, flash storage is the only permanent storage method without degradation, but there could be others I'm just not thinking of at the moment.<br /></div><br />Yes, I mean what I said. Flash is not a perfect storage medium, not even close. Flash is easily one of the worst storage mediums since it's prone to electrical damage, overwriting, block erasal, and most importantly: it attempts to retain a charge indefinitely to determine a bit state.<br /></div><br /><br />Flash memory isn't THAT bad.  Most microcontrollers these days (all?) that don't use mask ROMs use flash.  We use flash on our controls at work that run 24/7 365 days a year.  Never seen one lose their mind yet.  There's several thousand of them running all day every day.<br /><br />Newer aircraft "black boxes" are using flash these days instead of the magnetic wire 'cause it is more reliable, easy to test, and survives the crash better apparently.<br /><br />Flash uses tunneling to inject charges into a floating gate oxide.  Retention is spec'd at 40-100 years in the datasheet (depending on device).  Those electrons, once trapped, REALLY don't want to go anywhere <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":-)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />As for "block erasal", flash IS rewritable, so of course there are methods to erase it.  This is no different from a floppy where there's an erase/write head.  Unless the chip has a design flaw, the charge pump doesn't even come on unless an erase is initiated.  Without this charge pump, you cannot erase the flash no way no how.  You need a potential of around 12V for tunneling to take place.<br /><br />Electrical damage isn't much of an issue either;  the problems are easily managed (overvoltage protection devices),  ESD protection (integral to the chip, and you can provide your own external stuff too).   <br /><br />I personally cannot wait until we have some flash based HD replacements.
