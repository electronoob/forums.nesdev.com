		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Hi all!
<br />
<br />Sorry, if my English isn't good : )
<br />
<br />
<br />I'm newbie in emulation! Seven days ago i started to write my first emulator (of course NES ^__^). I had no imagination about how to write it or how it should works : )  Anyway, after 7 days (now) i can run few simple games, like SuperMarioBrothers, Excitebike, IceClimber and few more with 0 mapper.
<br />
<br />Before implementing various mappers i want to fix all emu glitches. look at screen below:
<br />
<br /><img src="http://l-proger.narod.ru/fail.png" alt="Image" />
<br />
<br />This is the only  one GFX bug in Mario, everything else looks really good.  Second day i can't figure out why some parts of background in startup menu are missing and few of them are replaced with "red cloud" sprites : \
<br />
<br />First thing i thought is that i did something wrong in background rendering code! I checked it 10 times - everything looks fine.   
<br />
<br />Then i used FCEUX to find one my corrupted tile address in VRAM and tiles ID in PatternTable!
<br />
<br />That tile:
<br /><img src="http://l-proger.narod.ru/fail2.png" alt="Image" />
<br />
<br />Here should be renderer tile with ID == 0x46  but instead rendered tile 0x24 (transparent)  o_O
<br />
<br />FCEUX says, that this tile ID is placed in 0x21A5 VRAM address (NameTable0). I made a few hooks to watch - what and when is writing at that address - and.. surprise! Game exactly writes value 0x24 (transparent)!!!  It means, that i render everything correcly but game writes wrong values in NameTable0!  
<br />
<br />And question is: "why?"  I think, that this is some kind of GFX debugging, implemented by Mario game programmers )  It's just a reaction on something made wrong.  So, maybe somebody know what exactly can allow game to produce such glitches?
<br />
<br />Big thanx to all! : )

<br />
<br />Yep, SMB is reading something from CHR-ROM, but reading is already implemented! : \  
<br />
<br />Maybe that can help: i tried to run CPU/PPU test ROMs on my EMU, but i can't see any sprites rendered! (only black screen). I tried so many tricks, so i don't have ideas now on what is wrong with emu.  Hmm.  
<br />
<br />(i implemented CHR-RAM writes too, so i expected that test ROMs would work fine, but they don't)

<br />
<br />I added  "-1" to read address!   Please, explain - why i should do this? I can't catch..
<br />
<br />If i understand correctly:
<br />To write some value to some address of VRAM, game should:
<br />
<br />1. Write VRAM address in PPU "VRAM Address Register 2" - 2 writes by 8 bits, then combine them to 16 bit address;
<br />
<br />2. Well, write data and then increment pointer by 1 or 32 bytes (depends on 0x4 bit of "PPU Control Register 1".
<br />
<br />And same thing to read data! Specify pointer to data and read it... hmm
<br />What's wrong? What I'm missing? : )

<br />I'm not sure what the internal buffer is, my guess is the last write, but let somebody else who really knows answer that. And also, keep in mind it's not for the palette range, those are directly read back, no buffer.

<br />Most of us don't know about the hardware details, so I'm not sure you'll get a definitive answer to this. What we DO know though is that the pattern and name tables, which are affected by the delay, are memory chips separate from the PPU chip, but the palette RAM is internal to the PPU, so it doesn't have to make any external memory accesses to fetch data from it.

<br />
<br />I am not 100% sure what happens on mixed read/write, but the pointer is incremented after each.  You can use reads to skip bytes to be written in chr space.
<br />
<br />I tested this ages ago and I cannot remember if the buffer (which stores the read byte) is used or not to store the written value.
<br />
<br />The reason reads are buffered is as described though:  the chip has to perform a read, and it takes longer to do this than the CPU can wait, so you get to read the previous buffer value instead.   The exception to this is the palette:  Since it's on-chip, there is no delay.  You read it back immediately.
<br />
<br />Once you read the buffer, the PPU then fetches the next byte from CHR space.
<br />
<br />As for reading memory UNDER the palette registers,  you can do this thanks to the buffer.  Reading from 3fxx will return palette data, and it will also read from 3fxx in PPU space (usually the nametables since they are mirrored from 2000-3fff).  This can be used to read one byte at a time from external space at 3fxx.
<br />
<br />To do this, you first read from i.e. 3f00 which returns the first palette entry,  then you read from somewhere else (i.e. 1000h or 0000h, basically anywhere except 3f00).  this will return the byte of data in the buffer, which was loaded from 3f00.
<br />
<br />Then you read from 3f01 to load the buffer,  then read from i.e. 1000h again to read the buffered byte.  This process then continues until you've read the entire "hidden" address space.
<br />
<br />How useful this is is debatable, but it will trip up many emulators if you wish to write emulator detection code for some reason (and it would make some dandy on-cart copy protection maybe if you were to map CHR ROM there in certain cases and then read it back discreetly later on).

<br />
<br />My first intuition would be to check the palette mirroring, but according to my best understanding I have implemented all the palette index mirrorings according to specifications...
<br />That is, all reads/writes to palette indexes, whether internally or through I/O, are routed through the following map:
