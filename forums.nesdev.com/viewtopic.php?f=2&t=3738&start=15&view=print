Plus, the software would have to waste a lot of time copiying stuff from one RAM to the other that this wouldn't even be optimal. Well, let's be frank, no matter ever had such a feature, and I'm 99.99% sure no one ever will. While not technically impossible, it'd be so complicated, boring, and ineficiant to do that nobody would be interested, and the thing can be considered impossible. So just stop askig qustions, MIX UP CHRRAM AND SRAM *IS* IMPOSSIBLE. And YES, I DO know electronics.
<br />
<br />You'd want to use classical CHRRAM or CHRROM a clever way instead, and at least you're sure this works. The smurfs are able to do a lot of CHRRAM writing because of PAL timing, this game couldn't even run on NTSC without major changes.
<br />
<br />If you really want to take both CHRRAM and CHRROM advantages at once use TQROM (or a simple modification of it) that's possible because Pinbot carts aren't too rare.

<br />Impossible to engineer as far as a one-of-a-kind prototype? No. Impossible to replicate in lots of 100 at an affordable price? Likely.

<br />It works fine in NTSC mode in emulators... haven't tested on hardware.
<br />
<br />About the topic, I do find this a bit pointless. This discussion about this "new mapper" may even live for a few more posts and threads, but it will surelly die long before something concrete is done about this, like so many other crazy ideas discussed here.
<br />
<br />I'm not against discussing ideas and all, but sometimes I feel that people in here discuss too much about such crazy ideas, and very few of them ever come out of the paper. They could often be making better use of their time...
<br />
<br />In the case of this thread in particular, I don't even think this discussion is justified... There are probably many other ways to do what the poster wants, simpler ways. Much simpler than designing a crazy-ass bulky cart impossible to reproduce...

Flicker the sprites if you have more than four independent objects, like one of the Final Fight games does. You'll eventually need to flicker anyway if you have more than two objects, as you can only fit two 32-pixel-wide objects on one scanline due to the 64-pixel limitation in the PPU's scanline buffer.
<br />
<br />Another suggestion, if you prefer CHR RAM: Slow your game to 30 fps. Update the palette, nametable, and OAM only on every second field. This should give you at least 320 bytes (20 tiles) of CHR updates per frame: 256 on frames when you don't update the palette and nametable and 64 more on frames when you do.

<br />
<br />I'll try using the tecnhnique in the smurfs thread to squeeze in 16 tile updates per vblank, and I'll be doing the Sprite DMA every 2 frames (30 fps) so that I can update both 32x32 pixel (4x4 tile) fighters.  I'm a lot more comfortable with software than hardware anyways.
<br />
<br />If I get the game going, I'll post about it.

<br />Then you should have played in on Nesticle....
<br />The smurfts does absolutely no special technique at all, not even unrolled loops or anything. It just make good use of PAL timing as opposed to NTSC timing. Do the same thing on NTSC would be a lot more complex and require a lot of trick.
<br />
<br />And yes, what I meant is that when you can do a trick by software or by hardware it's always better to do it by software, as it's emulatable and so on.
<br />Create new mappers is a crazy idea but why not if they can be reproducted using the powerpack or another decently doable *real* prototype. A cart needing 27 chips of 16 pins each fitting a NES cart case and that will never be possible with the powerpack either is not what I call a doable prototype. I had trouble to route a board with arround 5 additional chips (with ROM and RAM and without even a CIC) that I never made until now, but I don't think more than ~6 additional chips is even possible, even if the chips are small and if rooting is very convenient.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Updating OAM less than every frame is a bad idea IMHO, as it might give you jerky movement. A better idea would be to update OAM every frame, but only change the character's tiles (and the tile indices in your OAM buffer) at every second frame, or possibly as rarely as every fourth frame. The principle is that jerkiness in the character's framechanges is much less noticeable than jerkiness in the overall movement. Battletoads does something like this.
<br />
<br />Also, if you can accept having more of a letterboxed view in your fighting game, then artificially extending your vblank period by manually blanking the screen is a good solution. For a fighting game, the threat comes from the sides anyway, so the player won't feel handicapped by not being able to see as much of the sky/ground as in a platformer. Merely blanking the top and bottom 8 scanlines (which most NTSC TVs cut off anyway) will give you enough cycles to write an additional 14 tiles each frame. (just a rough calculation :)

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Yes, artificial blanking is the way to go, and as Banamnos said you should update OAM every frame. Anyways, you wouldn't want the character to change graphics each single frame no matter how much limitations there is. So change each character each frame out of 4 will look abolutely normal in fact, this isn't even jerkiness at all. Updating OAM one frame out of two would be jerkiness, and it would not gain a lot of time anyway.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I you need 2 frames to update all the tiles of each fighter, then each player will have it's tiles updated every 4 frames. If you consider that the NES runs at 60 frames per second, that'd result in 15 frames per second for the animations... that's pretty good for animation. You'll hardly need animations faster than that (it would even require a lot of space in the ROM to store so many tiles).
<br />
<br />So, if you do update their positions every frame (sprite DMA), but only change the animation frame every 4 NES frames, it will probably feel smooth enough.
<br />
<br />The only problem with updating the graphics little by little is that you can't just overwrite the previous tiles, because you do not want to change the graphics until all the new tiles have been loaded. So, even though a player only needs 32 tiles, you'll have to dedicate 64 tiles from VRAM to it, and alternate which 32 it uses every 4 frames.
<br />
<br />But even then, both players will only use 128 tiles, so you still have plenty of tiles for effects, blood, backgrounds, etc.
<br />
<br />May I suggest something? In frames where there is no need to update any player tiles (this should happen once in a while), you could use the time to update some background tiles for more dynamic backgrounds, such as the people watching the fights in Street Fighter games. It will not matter if their animation is not constant.

<br />I'm pretty sure this would be unnoticeable, however I can be wrong.
<br />Also one animation all 4 frames is pretty fast in fact. In my game I animate things all 8 frames (by changin the tile used) for my player, and sometimes even less for other objects. However, those aren't the most detailed graphics either.
<br />You just shouldn't mix up the change of the pose, and the movement of the object. The change of the pose can be rarified, not the movement of the object.
