	<tr>
		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />so what are the versions of the cic again?
<br />
<br />There's 3193, 6113, 6113B1 for NSTC.  3193 is in every NSTC system and early carts.  6113 ones are in later carts.  Am I missing any NSTC?
<br />
<br />Then one of the pal ones is 3195A, right?  Can anyone satisfy my curiosity in what the pal ones are and which are which?  Are there any more than two pal CIC region versions (understand that there may be more than two numbers, but are there more than two compatible versions).
<br />
<br />Thanks!

<br />
<br />Also, does anyone have a hong kong or Korean official 72 pin cart?  I'm curious what CIC versions they use over there.
<br />
<br />Basically there was a test cart auction a few days ago (already pulled, guy put prototype in the title) and it had a bunch of aisian writting on both the outside and the sticker on the eprom.  It specifically said "CIC 3197" on the label.  It was a NES-21G-CPU-72P which I don't believe could be used to test a famicombox.  
<br />
<br />Therefore I was wondering if it was a test cart used in either Korea or Hong Kong where official 72pin carts were also released.

<br />3195A is what I found in most of my carts, wich are in B region.
<br />Looks like A regions are United Kingdom, Australia and Italia, while B is most other europe countries. I don't understand the logic here, Nintendo should have drunk when they determined the region lockout.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Here's the list:
<br />
<br />3193 - *USA/canada
<br />6113 - same as above, die shrink w/ slight change on init
<br />3194 - unkown... might be Korean NES
<br />3195 - *PAL B
<br />3196 - asian version, HK version
<br />3197 - *PAL A
<br />3198 - Famicombox lockout chip (in the carts+system)
<br />3199 - Famicombox coin timer (in the system only)
<br />
<br />* - this chip has been emulated by me
<br />
<br />There are no known chips before 3193 (i.e. 3192 or whatever).  It seems odd that they would've started with 3193 instead of say, 3190... but this is Nintendo we're talking about.
<br />
<br />As for the 6113, it's kinda weird.  I will be posting dumps later of:
<br />
<br />3193 lock, 6113 key (how it normally works)
<br />6113 lock, 6113 key (supposidly works, haven't tested)
<br />6113 lock, 3193 key (does NOT work, I tested)
<br />
<br />As mentioned in another post, I just bought two "Asian version" carts off of ebay, so I should be getting those in a week or two.  I will then produce another set of dumps for those chips so they can be sussed out.
<br />
<br />And as before, does anyone have Korean NES carts?
<br />
<br />Also, I *think* the ROB might have a similar CPU to the lockout chip in it- it's a 16 pin chip but it is marked RFC-CPU10. Here's a pic:
<br />
<br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://tripoint.org/kevtris/mappers/incoming/Rob_Bottom.jpg">http://tripoint.org/kevtris/mappers/inc ... Bottom.jpg</a><!-- m -->
<br />
<br />The biggest difference I saw was this used a resonator instead of an external clock.  But... clock mode could easily be a mask option during programming.  I dunno.
<br />
<br />Ha! 
<br />
<br />I just checked my lockout chip I have on test (a 3197) and pin 5 is clock out!  So, the lockout chip COULD run with a resonator instead of an external clock.   In that case, ROB's CPU very well could be the same.  It'd be hung across pins 5 and 6 if this were true... and checking that picture, the resonator is sitting right by pins 5 and 6.  The plot thickens.
<br />
<br />Does anyone have an ROB they can open up and check real quick? I don't have one any more so I cannot check.  Looks like it's a standard pierce oscillator setup.  R6 will be across the xtal points,  C2 and C3 from each leg to ground, and R5 might be in series with Xout (pin 5) to limit drive to the resonator.
