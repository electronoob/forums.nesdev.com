Problems I had were related to the vertical scroll after a split (still is mystery what was wrong) and to working with OAM without using OAM DMA (it just was a bad idea).

<br />
<br />In my mind, this is also a bug in the emulators.  They were not emulating real hardware accurately.  I assume that someone could construct a test for this, like Blargg's test roms.  I thought about reducing my problem to a demo rom and releasing it, but a) I needed to use my time on other things and b) Blargg is gone, so idk if he or anyone would updating his test roms.  "Clueless's test rom" would most likely be forgotten / ignored, as I lack the serious cred that Blargg has.

<br />That's what the wiki is for. If you make the test ROM, and I can verify that it runs differently on my PowerPak and on one of the big three emulators, I will promote it.

<br />On real hardware (and Nintendulator) my sprites did not show up.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />The mistake I made when I was making some NES homebrew was using sprites without DMA. On emulator it looked fine. I think I used FCEU. This was a long time ago though. Later when more accurate emulators came about I tried the program again and saw it fail and like only 1 sprite even appeared on the screen. 
<br />
<br />It just shows the important of testing on real hardware. Even though the PowerPAK isn't spot on for something like mapper IRQ behavior of the MMC3, for other boards without IRQ it's a great tool. I know some mentioned you don't get the raw power-up state but that's a minor issue if you just be sure to initialize everything as you should.

<br />
<br />Sometimes I run into things that break differently on hardware and an emulator, though. But they've always been shown as clearly broken by an emulator. For instance, now my screen updates are running a little too long. On FCEUX this occasionally caused the scrolling to jump, but on an actual NES it was actually crashy.

This lets you use the prerender scanline as vblank time, so I see no reason not to do it, as long as you also do full 2005/2006 writes to set scrolling.  It also makes the scrolling merely jump if your code is too long, instead of crazy corruption.

<br />
<br />But it's just a personal choice.
<br />
<br />When it comes to sprite updates without using DMA, I just ask, why ? Even if it worked, there would be absolutely no point in it since it would just be a huge waste of CPU time. Maybe if you never use all 64 sprites it would save a little RAM but really it's not worth it.

<br />
<br />Now keep in mind that I've only executed one program on an NES (last night) but I did run into an issue. I cleared my OAM RAM to all 0xFF's, but I was not executing a sprite DMA after that. This was fine on an emulator (not sure why...) but on the hardware this resulted in random sprites all over the screen.
<br />
<br />This would not be noticeable if your NMI handler does a sprite DMA every frame, but my engine uses an "OAM Updated" flag to trigger this, which in my test ROM was never getting set as it does not use sprites.

<br />I do exactly that, and I think it's a good idea, because if for some reason your frame didn't finish in time (and a NMI happens), the OAM page is half-updated, and you probably don't want to do any sprite DMA, because sprites would flicker (as if there wasn't enough sprite flicker with the 8-sprites-per-line limitations...)
<br />
<br />However it works fine at startup because in my routine that clears OAM with $f0's (I guess I use $f0's although $ff might work just as well) I set the "OAM updated" flag.
