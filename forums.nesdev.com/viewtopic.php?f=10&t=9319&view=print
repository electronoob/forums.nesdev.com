My apologies.</em></span><br /><br />I'm actually also new to coding in C, but I find it much easier than ASM. I'm the kind of learner who likes to ask a lot of questions, so if anyone can help, it'd be <em>MUCH</em> appreciated.<br /><br />Anyhow, I've always been really interested in coding for olders systems, and the NES dev scene seemed to be the most lively out of them all and I decided to give it a try. I've just entered the process of learning C (with a very basic knowledge of C++ already existing in my mind) and decided that as I learn new things in C and make a program out of them, that I could then take the time to learn to do the same thing on the NES. <br /><br />So basically, I have both a basic text output and button input program coded, and I've already successfully converted the text output program to the NES:<br /><br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">#include &quot;conio.h&quot;<br /><br />int main(void)<br />{<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;clrscr();<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;cprintf(&quot;Hey there! I'm the NES; glad to meet ya'!\n&quot;)&quot;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;while(1)<br />{<br />}<br />}</div><br /><br />So <s>now that I can make my NES talk dirty to me,</s> naturally, it was time to work on the button input program, yes? However, the problem is, I have no idea how to do this. I tried looking at some open-source code to see if I could figure it out myself, but I always got errors when trying to compile it with cc65. Would anyone be willing to lend me a hand?

On PC you have debuggers, nice IDEs and stuff like that, plus tons of docs on anything related.

In your example you use some library that contains clrscr and cprintf implementations for the NES. If it also have input processing functions, you should use them. Alternatively you can get another library, write your own library in assembly code and link it to your program, or write code in C that will directly access the hardware via pointers (possible, but is not recommended, as it slow and has unpredictable timings).

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I've done a bit of work with cc65 on NES.<br /><br />I didn't consider the NES libraries that came with cc65 worthwhile for making games, except maybe a text adventure.<br /><br />My approach has been to write low-level stuff in assembly (e.g. NMI graphics  update, controller reading, sound register control) and then the rest as C unless it needs to be fast. I don't have anything prepared that I could share, at the moment, though. I wasn't trying to build a library anybody could use. When I've done some more work I'll probably make it open source, but I can't really provide a useful &quot;library&quot; at the moment.<br /><br />Shiru's library is a good starting point. I would recommend trying that. I've only looked at it a little, because I find it easier to write my own stuff, but from what I've seen it's quite usable to make a small game without modification.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I wrote a tutorial for writing in C for the NES indeed, but using my own library. It does not have any generic things like cprintf and other standart stuff that is quite useless for real games, but does have everything you actually need to make a simple (and not so simple) games.<br /><br />Why I made my own library - it is the same reasons rainwarrior mentioned. It is easier for me to write own stuff than to figure out something not really used and documented, and I'm sure these bundled libs are not have everything that is actually needed. No music and sound effects support, for example.

If you are just learning C the NES is not the best thing to learn on. Or - if you are just learning NES, C is not the best way to learn the NES. If you want to learn 6502 assembly, then maybe you can learn the NES at the same time.
