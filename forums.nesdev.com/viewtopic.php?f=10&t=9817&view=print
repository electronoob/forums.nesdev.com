		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Hi All,<br /><br />I'm nearing completion of my PONG game but I'm having trouble understanding how to properly wait for VBLANK. When my game is over I am blanking the screen and loading a new name table in that says game over.<br /><br />The problem is, when I blank the screen and turn it back on, rendering is starting halfway down the screen instead of at the beginning of the screen where it should be.<br /><br />The code I'm using to load in the new screen is this. <br /><br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">&nbsp; UpdateToGameOver:<br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;;; Turn Screen Off<br /><br />&nbsp; LDA #%00000000<br />&nbsp; STA $2001<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;JSR BlankSprites<br /><br />;; Load Palettes for Game Area<br /><br />&nbsp; LoadPalettes3:<br />&nbsp; LDA $2002 ; read PPU status to reset the high/low latch<br />&nbsp; LDA #$3F<br />&nbsp; STA $2006 ; write the high byte of $3F00 address<br />&nbsp; LDA #$00<br />&nbsp; STA $2006 ; write the low byte of $3F00 address<br />&nbsp; LDX #$00 ; start out at 0<br /><br />&nbsp; LoadPalettesLoop3:<br />&nbsp; LDA palette3, x ; load data from address (palette + the value in x)<br />; 1st time through loop it will load palette+0<br />; 2nd time through loop it will load palette+1<br />; 3rd time through loop it will load palette+2<br />; etc<br />&nbsp; STA $2007 ; write to PPU<br />&nbsp; INX ; X = X + 1<br />&nbsp; CPX #$10 ; Compare X to hex $10, decimal 16 - copying 16 bytes = 4 sprites<br />&nbsp; BNE LoadPalettesLoop3 ; Branch to LoadPalettesLoop if compare was Not Equal to zero<br />; if compare was equal to 32, keep going down<br /><br />&nbsp; LoadGameOverBackground:<br /><br />&nbsp; LDA $2002 ;Read PPU status to reset hi/lo latch<br />&nbsp; LDA #$20<br />&nbsp; STA $2006 ;write the high byte of $2000 address<br />&nbsp; LDA #$00<br />&nbsp; STA $2006 ;write the low byte of the $2000 address<br /><br /><br />&nbsp; LoadGameOverLoop:<br /><br />&nbsp; LDA #$00<br />&nbsp; STA pointer2&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ; put the low byte of the address of background into pointer --- This equals 00?<br />&nbsp; LDA #HIGH(gameoverscreen) ;What does the #HIGH signify?

The first is the VblankWaitLoop at the bottom of the screen is improperly coded. Its actually an infinite loop. This causes the screen to render in the appropriate location, but why?<br /><br />In my mind, I should be using this code for the VblankWaitLoop<br /><br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">&nbsp;LDX #$30<br />&nbsp;VblankWaitLoop:<br />&nbsp; DEX<br />&nbsp; CPX #$01<br />&nbsp; BNE VblankWaitLoop<br /><br /></div><br /><br />But the code that makes sense to me does not actually work. Any thoughts guys?

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />When VBlank hits, an NMI is generated. That's what yo use to determine it. either run code in the NMI, of make the NMI do something a loop in the main code looks for:<br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://wiki.nesdev.com/w/index.php/NMI_thread">http://wiki.nesdev.com/w/index.php/NMI_thread</a><!-- m --><br /><br />That may help. My NMI is just:<br /><br />INC Frame<br /><br />and a loop sits comparing waiting the frame value to change, because when it does you know a vblank happened and you're in vblank then. This is only good for games that don't use all the frame time, though.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />The proper way to wait for VBlank is to put something in your NMI that will alert the program that VBlank has happened. A common solution is to put <strong>INC FrameCounter</strong> somewhere in your NMI handler, so that you can wait for VBlank by waiting for that variable to change:<br /><br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">&nbsp; &nbsp;lda FrameCounter<br />WaitForVBlank:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;cmp FrameCounter<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;beq WaitForVBlank</div><br />Just do this before turning rendering on or off and you'll never get half-rendered screens.<br /><br />The code you currently have is just an arbitrary delay that may happen to work given the current conditions, but if you change anything else that affects the timing it might stop working. Don't use that kind of hardcoded delays to wait for an event that is reported by the machine, there's no need to &quot;guess&quot; when VBlank will happen if the machine tells you when it does.

Thank you for clearing that up.<br /><br />-Spencer

The code I wrote will work even if you don't initialize <strong>FrameCounter</strong> at all. Notice how after loading the value the loop keeps comparing it to the variable, which will only be changed by the NMI, once it fires. As you can see, no matter the value it will be changed by the NMI handler, so you'll know that VBlank has started.<br /><br />You can use <strong>FrameCounter</strong> as an actual frame counter for other purposes if you want to... personally I don't see much use for that, but if you think that a value that's incremented once per frame can help you in other areas of your game, I see no reason for you not to use it.
