<br />I wrote a partial NES emulator for the Megadrive a couple of years ago. I never wrote any rendering code, so the only graphical output it had was displaying the current NES palette every frame. Of course the speed was horrible..

<br />
<br />How do you figure?  The hardest part is creating the BRR encoded samples -- but you could probably just rip those from Mario All Stars or a similar game.  Hell you probably even be able to rip the music engine straight out of All Stars and drop it right into the conversion -- that way you wouldn't have to rescore the soundtrack and write a new music engine like you would have to on the Genesis.

For example, I believe there's one 68000 instruction 'dbeq' that does the equivalent of 68000 'dex; bpl'. Things like 'lda #something; sta somewhere' can be optimized into memory-to-memory 'move' instructions. But still, the amount of time spent optimizing the CPU would figure into the cost-benefit curve, probably with a lower weight for optimizations that can be performed automatically for each ROM.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">As far as the SNES goes, it has tons of features -- but the only one you'd probably use would be DMA... and probalby HDMA to split the screen (unless you put the status bar on another layer, which would probably be easier)</div><br />All-Stars appears to use the third (low-color) layer for both the status bar and a parallax plane.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">3)  The same nametable concepts that apply to the NES apply to the SNES as well.

<br />As I understand it, we're using SMB1 only as an example of a generic NROM/CNROM/U*ROM game that would be ported. So we have to pretend All-Stars doesn't exist, as it wouldn't for the other games.

<br />Has anyone looked through All-stars and the NES games to see if code was reused?  I just tried and ran into technical problems with the SNES9x debugger.
<br />
<br />I did manage to find a string of instructions that looked almost identical except for a few extra ones in All-stars and different addresses.

SMB3 even has its level select and debug mode intact, though the level select was not fully updated to match the new hardware, and it displays graphical glitches as a result (though it is still completely functional).
<br />
<br />SMB2 and SMB3 seem to have fared better during the conversion process than SMB1 and Lost Levels, though: both of those games have some odd quirks not present in the originals (for example, Super Mario does not rebound properly when he smashes a brick).
<br />
<br />The SMAS ROM is interesting to browse through in a tile editor, as all of the graphics are uncompressed. Some of the original NES graphics are still present, some unused graphics were redrawn, and there are some completely new unused graphics, including a page of Mario poses in various stages of tweaking (slightly different shading, hands in various positions).
