If you buy a Flash Cartridge you will spend around $100 approximately. However if you build a cartridge with an EPROM, the first big expense is the EPROM programmer which depending on which one you get the costs can vary greatly. You might be able to get a fairly basic one for around $40 or so or a nicer one being maybe around $100, all the way to the really nice ones which could be $400 maybe even more. <br /><br />Next, the typical EPROM people use for SNES games is the 8 megabit (1 megabyte) 8bit eprom. If a game is larger than that you have to use more eproms. That would be fine except that these chips are not super cheap. And I don't believe they are even manufactured anymore as they are obsolete components. But lets say you can get them for about $5 each. That's not too bad for smaller games. But many games are fairly large and will take 3 or 4 chips. So suddenly you could be spending $20 just on eproms for one game. You also need to provide yourself a sacrifice game to remove it's original rom from. Then you have misc costs of wire, solder, soldering tools. <br /><br />So while if you are really efficient and only want to play a few games you might spend less than you would with a Flash Cartridge, you are still going to be putting alot of work into the few you do versus next to no effort with a Flash Cartridge. I'm just trying to make the point clear that if you want to play the games on your SNES, it really is a poor choice compared to a professional Flash Cartridge.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">tepples wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"><br />For one thing, the manual labor of rewiring.

You never did say what you are wanting to do. If you want to just play the games on your SNES, stay away from EPROMs. It's ALOT of work, it's expensive, and if you don't know what you are doing it's going to be alot worse. Instead, buy a Flash Cartridge which is a reprogrammable cartridge that is easy to use. Buy one here: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.tototek.com/store/index.php?main_page=product_info&amp;cPath=1_8_11&amp;products_id=39">http://www.tototek.com/store/index.php? ... ucts_id=39</a><!-- m --> or here: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.mash-mods.com/">http://www.mash-mods.com/</a><!-- m --><br /><br />Unless you only plan to play a very small number of games like 2 or 3 games, you'll spend way more with EPROMs than if you buy a Flash Cartridge.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=1726">MottZilla</a> — Sun Oct 04, 2009 11:02 am</p><hr />

The SNES MaskROMs do not have a standard pinout. You can't just replace the chip and solder an EPROM in its place. You must rewire the board or rewrire the legs of the EPROM that don't match the SNES maskrom pinout. The largest 32pin EPROM suitable for the task is the 27C801 which is 1 MegaByte of storage. With relatively little rewiring you can solder it into the PCB's ROM socket. However for anything larger than that you have to start adding logic chips to decode things. <br /><br />So before making any SNES cartridge changes you should ask yourself what your purpose is exactly. If you just want to play some of your ROMs on a real SNES, there are much better ways of doing that than building cartridges. Forinstance you can get a reprogrammable cartridge called a Flash Cartridge. There are two main ones for SNES now, the SuperFlash by Tototek ( <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.tototek.com">http://www.tototek.com</a><!-- m --> ) and the SNESFlash (I'm assuming) by MashMods ( <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.mash-mods.com/products/snes">http://www.mash-mods.com/products/snes</a><!-- m --> ).<br /><br />If you prefer something different you could always get a Backup Device/Cartridge Copier which is a large device that sits ontop of your SNES cartridge port and has a Floppy Disk drive and possibly a communications port on it to allow loading ROM images into memory in the device that allows you to play the ROM images on your console.<br /><br />Costs will vary but the key thing is that if you just want to play alot of games you can make one investment to play any number of games you wish opposed to if you want to put EPROMs in cartridges, the costs will very quickly be much more than if you'd gone with a flash cartridge or other device. But in the end it's a matter of personal preference.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=1726">MottZilla</a> — Sat Oct 03, 2009 9:07 pm</p><hr />
