<br />
<br />Here is my first full-blown game project.  It's been approx. two months in the making and the engine is almost complete.  Soon I begin adding levels.  Here are some vids of the gameplay demo on youtube, just to give people an idea of what I'm going for.

<br />Hope you folks enjoy the vids!
<br />
<br />----Synopsis-----
<br />Assimilate is an easy to grasp 2D sidescrolling action game for the NES.  You control a UFO that moves from city to city assimilating their local populations.
<br />
<br />In each city, your radar points you in the general direction of the next weak-minded fool.  As you get within range of the target, an arrow appears to show you where they are.  Simply hover above the arrow and hold the B button to extend your beam.  When it reaches the building, the victim will begin levitating into your ship and henceforth the assimilation will automatically begin.  But don't let go of the B button before the victim is securely in your ship, or the beam shuts off and the victim plummets to their death.  And what's much more tragic, you lose points!
<br />
<br />Any time you don't have a victim in your beam or in your ship, you can switch between four different tools used to assimilate your victims by pressing Start and cycling through the options.  Some tools take longer to assimilate the victims while onboard your ship, but once the victim is planted back in the city your Assimilation % gets a significantly higher boost.  Weaker tools will assimilate the victim much quicker, but will also give a lower Assimilation % when the victim is placed back into the population.
<br />
<br />While a victim is aboard, your ship moves at half-speed, making it a bit more difficult to dodge those annoying missiles and bullets.  If you have a lot closing in on you and need to move quick, you can press A to eject the victim and return to normal speed.  However, you will lose points and your Assimilation Progress Bar at the top of the screen will, of course, revert to zero.  And the victim will plummet to horrible splattering death bla bla bla â€“ what sucks is you loose points and progress.
<br />
<br />The objective of each stage is to reach 100% assimilation as fast as you can.  At the end of the stage, any time you have accrued gets deducted from your score, so MOVE!

<br />Ahh yes it does now!  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /> That game is awesome...
<br />
<br />
<br />Any chance a demo will be put out of the first level or anything? I'd like to play it, looks fun!

<br />
<br />Most likely I'll have a demo at some point.  I'm not sure yet if I want to post this one you see in the video online just because it's still a bit rough and there's some things with scoring/enemies/etc I'm still fleshing out.  I will be taking this to the NA Campout next week though just to get some live feedback from the other attendees.  If I get too busy designing the levels I might just go ahead and post this one in the Youtube video regardless.

<br />You'd be suprised I bet, I know once I get off my lazy butt and do a coupel hours worth of programming I'll release a game that'll be as fun as crackers but I screwed some code up and need to re-write the engine anyway. All in good time! <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />
<br />
<br />
<br />But this loks really awesome, I can't wait for a demo and for even more to be added, it seems like there's quite a few things in it already! Man I can't wait for this <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /> <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /> <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /> <img src="./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" />
<br />
<br />Well I'm not going to be at the campout, with I would be able too.....I have band camp! <img src="./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" />

How about a forum for game development blogs (free form)? People could share their current progress, ideas and ask questions. It would be cool to have most game dev blogs (maybe tool dev etc also) in the same place.</div>
<br />Personally I think forum would be more suitable place for stuff like this than the wiki.
<br />
<br />E: It could be called "Project Blogs" or smth like that so it would cover all types of NESDev related projects: games, demos, tools, hardware, ...
