<br />I don't think they always did... I think that the first time you work with a platform it's hard to know where the limits are, but after several projects on the same platform you start to guess much better! =)
<br />
<br />I know that when I am designing my programs I have several backup plans, in case my primary plan turns out to be impossible to implement. So for each different part of my programs I think of 2 or 3 ways they could be implemented, and when placing all the parts together I decide how to distribute my resources, possibly using the simpler/faster/smaller solutions in some cases.

<br />It's a design page about scrolling.  They say they want to keep the "athletic" Mario from DK Jr. and Mario Brothers, but they want him to be bigger. Due to his bigger size they need to have the background scroll.
<br />
<br />The description of the scrolling is familiar.  Mario advances through levels left to right.   When moving right, he will eventually reach a space called "Scroll Start".  When Mario reaches "Scroll Start", his sprite stops moving and the background scrolls instead.  Scroll speed is determined by Mario's running speed.  If Mario slows down, the scroll slows down.  If movement stops, Mario can walk left.  Here, the screen doesn't scroll.  Mario can move to the leftmost edge of the screen but not any further.

<br />Thanks so much, MetalSlime! <img src="./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /> Very interesting, I wonder where are the documents that were later in development and figured out that scrolling can only be X pixels and stuff. I know scrolling on here got a lot of talk and stuff brought up about it, where is it here? <img src="./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /> <img src="./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" />

<br />In fact we might even be surprised how they planify everything and do code last.
<br />As you said, we wants to say results immediately, this is our nature and this is perfectly normal.
<br />
<br />I've recently found an article about a FDS RPG that was going to be released on 5 disks, and that was given up early in the development, despite some japanese people already having pre-ordered it. Too bad I don't remember where I read that... I found that "by accident" when I was investigating prototypes though. They said there was no chances of finding leaked prototypes of games that never made it even close to being finished.
<br />
<br />So yeah, how comes that they knew the game would fit 5 sides, but have given up very early in the development ? Also how comes people could pre-order a game that was just starting to get developped ?
<br />The only answer is that they planned everything, estimating how many bytes it would takes. Also, they could develop a game in only a couple of months (not that this would make a good game though).
<br />
<br />Or this could also as well be fake / distorted / mistranslated info. Especially since I don't remember the site, it was a site about prototypes.

<br />I find it curious how they have to explain in so much detail something that is so simple. OTOH, back in 84/85 scrolling wasn't so common, and not that many games used it.

<br />
<br />I don't think the pre-ordering was all that uncommon, I remember years ago some gaming magazines had ads/pricelists where you could order games, and those lists did include games that weren't even out yet.  I didn't notice if there were selling ones that didn't get released, but I wouldn't be surprised.
<br />
<br />Was the game you are thinking of Seiken Densetsu?  I'd read that it was an FDS game originally.

<br />That or they were planning to port a nearly finished prototype that they had going on some computer platform.

<br />Yes, it was Seiken Densetsu I was mentioning. (for people who don't know it eventually was made a Gameboy game, and it's fun because that is the one that inspired me to do my current NES projet, Dragon Skill).
<br />Few FDS games were more than one disk, let alone 5 ! That's 640 KB of data, more than FF3 !
<br />So yeah I wonder how they could know the # of disks in advance... although I guess it's something you had to decide pretty early in development, as you have to decide when the user will have to switch disks, so what data goes on what disk.
<br />
<br />It's possible to determine how much space you use for various data such as text, maps etc... but it's hard to determine size of the code without coding anything !
<br />If you compress data it becomes even harder to predict how much space it will take.

<br />
<br />It's been my experience living and working in Japan that the Japanese love to produce documents.  The office culture here pressures you to "always appear busy even if you have nothing to do".  The result is a surplus of documents.  I'm being half-silly, but it's a little true.  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />

<br />A lot of "compression" on small-RAM platforms such as the NES consisted of static dictionary compression (such as metatiling) and various methods to avoid <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fragmentation_%28computer%29#Internal_fragmentation" class="postlink">internal fragmentation</a>, which provide a roughly constant ratio. It's also possible to estimate a rough compression ratio based on a completed 1-chapter tech demo and (roughly) extrapolate that to the full game.

<br />Well no idea how you could guess the size of the code. I also had no clue about that function points. I bet it depends a lot of your coding style and efficiency too.
