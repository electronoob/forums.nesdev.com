<br />Because is the first step to have a full system-on-chip; that 's one of the projects I would like to finish before I die <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />
<br />Emulating SuperFX chip via programmable logic is the other one XD

<br />
<br />does anyone have a 3197 / 6117 laying around they don't need or could donate?
<br />it's for the UK/Italy/Australia regions. need one for testing..
<br />apparently the timing is a little different...
<br />i'll send the person a copy of my chip when it's finished as a thank you <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />
<br />
<br />i also don't have 3195/Europe and 3196/Asia but they should work the same as the 3193.
<br />for the snes i have F411/D411 but the PAL chip is the same
<br />
<br />guess i'll offer the same deal with the other chip numbers <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />
<br />don't think i need them but they would be good for testing..
<br />so if you send me a cic i don't have i'll send you a programmed atmega8-16pu
<br />
<br />about my last post for the load seed from table loop i decided to load two bytes in parallel and interweave the seeds..
<br />the seed is selected with a 0-7 and i still have an extra 56 cycles to play with <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />
<br />
<br />i'll be testing the nes lock/key today
<br />working on the snes part i noticed lots of change in code
<br />the port3 pins could have something to do with disabling the game??
<br />haven't looked much into that yet
<br />
<br />hope implementing both the snes and nes cic's doesn't ugly up my code lol

<br />
<br />EDIT: if anyone has a AVR they think it should compile for let me know
<br />i'm writing it for atmega8 but it will compile for attiny's
<br />
<br />it's taking a little longer then i thought it would.. not that i'm racing lol
<br />for the nes/snes only parts i'm just using a flag and it's working out perfect
<br />as an option the delay at the start of the snes cic code can trigger snes mode
<br />this will allow us to use 6 pin attiny4 and 9 as a universal key! <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />
<br />pin connections would be P0.0, P0.1, 4 Mhz, RST IN, VCC, GND
<br />
<br />some of the code can be made smaller by putting it into loops and arranged for better flow
<br />it would be something if i could make it fit into 512 bytes
<br />
<br />i'm going to look in to copyright a little more just encase lol
<br />not too worried about it.. my code is different but i wan't to know what they call different <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Hi
<br />
<br />My first post here  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_surprised.gif" alt=":o" title="Surprised" /> 
<br />
<br />I have just tried a couple of the PICs from ikari_01 on a PAL SNES, the first one on a 12f629 works  - except doesn't start my only SA-1 game (Kirby 3) - not a problem - there's people in here with mixed success stories on SA-1 games and this mod.
<br />
<br />The second - the SuperCIC, first of all - it works with my Kirby 3  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" />  - that's very impressive!!  
<br />
<br />There are two problems I'm having though:
<br />
<br />If I have it on Auto ORANGE, it remembers it this setting, but after switching the console off and back on again, the LED doesn't light at all, it's still operating in Auto mode, just no LED.  If I reset the console the LED stays ORANGE, but the screen goes very bright, black is now grey it's so bright.
<br />
<br />If I have it on 60hz RED, it remembers the video mode after switching the console off, but the LED will be GREEN.
<br />
<br />50hz mode works fine.
<br />
<br />Have I done something wrong?
<br />
<br />Oh, I removed the original lock chip and put the 10k resistor in there.  And I have pin 4 of SuperCIC at 5v.  I am using a 3 leg LED.
<br />
<br />Many thanks
<br />Pete
<br />(edited to make corrections)

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Currently I have no clue about the bright screen issue, it never happened to me so far.
<br />
<br />The LED color problem may be related to pin 7 of the PIC. Pin 7 selects LED polarity. Connect it to 5V for common anode LEDs or GND for common cathode LEDs. If it is left unconnected the input will sometimes read 1 and sometimes 0, resulting in confusion of the LED color.

<br />I just realised I forgot about Pin 7 on the SuperCIC <img src="./images/smilies/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt=":roll:" title="Rolling Eyes" />  .  I just grounded it and all is now working properly.  Including the grey screen issue.
<br />
<br />Ikari_01, thank you so much for releasing the BEST snes mod.  And as I said in my message the other day - I will add a guide to my site and give all credit to you  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /> 
<br />
<br />Thanks again

<br />I tried it our using a PIC16F630 on a Pal SNES and it works great. I removed the CIC chip and used the resistor.
<br />
<br />jims cool: Are you still after a 3197? If so, I have one here that I can send you, '3197A' from a Pal NES.

<br />I'd like somebody to try it out as I don't have a PowerPak myself and was only able to observe the behavior of the SNES itself.

<br />
<br />Any chance you could tell me how to put the hex files into the PIC16F630 and the PIC12F629 correctly?
<br />I came across the files on wolfsoft blog website.
<br />In the zip file contains A LEGAL DISCLAIMER FILE x2 hex files and x2 .asm files.
<br />As I understand it .asm is the source files for people that understands PIC chip assemby.
<br />How do you write supercic-key.hex + supercic-lock.hex to the appropriate PIC chips?
<br />
<br />The supercic-lock.hex is the code for a PIC16F630 which goes in the snes console and the supercic-key.hex is PIC12F629 to be used in a snes cartridge?
<br />If you use a PIC16F630 with the hex file supercic-lock.hex  The  fuse setting on the chip id or what ever your programmer calls it set to 34C4 Am I correct?
<br />Sorry to ask questions like this but from the start of this supercic project it appears to of changed from its initial release.
<br />
<br />Many Thanks 
<br />caketin

<br />
<br />I've got just one question;
<br />The supercic lock works without any problem.
<br />
<br />I've tried the supercic Key with a 12f629, programmed successfully without problem (on my wellon vp 280). Soldered with your instructions on the asm file.
<br />
<br />On my PAL snes console, without any mod/modification the game refuse to start...with another SNES (old switching mod, pal/ntsc and 50/60hz) the game run only with ntsc and 50 or 60 hz, in pal its never starts...
<br />
<br />Did you have any idea ?
<br />
<br />Thanks and respect again for this incredible mod ^^

Game Genie or Action Replay is needed to play these games unless you modify your console. This is all separate from the CIC. The CIC is just the first block against playing imports. With the wrong CIC the SNES will stay in a Reset state. With a region free type CIC this won't happen but the software can check if the system is running in NTSC or PAL mode and refuse to run or just show a message warning you that you are in the wrong region.
