personally if I had it to do over I would have bought one of the earthbound repos rather than doin it myself. I can handle the hardware aspect no problem but there cases are far prettier than what I can do.<br /><br />I justify this by the fact that if Nintendo just made the game I would have bought it but I could not so I see no reason I should be deprived.<br /><br />The fact that reproductions and game hacks exist for sale would not stop me from buying a homebrew created game. I do not think they are really in direct competition with each other, really there is not a very large market for ether.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=188">peppers</a> — Wed Aug 18, 2010 9:39 pm</p><hr />

Games that were unsuccessful the day of their release but that gained popularity with the emulation scenes are also good candidate. On the NES, Earthbound, Final Fantasy and Dragon Warrior games could be good candidates for bootlegging.<br /><br />I know quite a lot of Seiken Densetsu 3 and Chrono Trigger bootlegs were made. Someone can buy a cart of Illusion of Time for about $5 and replace the ROM with one of those games and sell it for more than $100. Not only this is illegal profit, but it's more the lie behind the sell (that the cart is authentic) and the fact people "kindly ask for advice on making their devart" here when in fact they are just doing fake carts.<br />I'm not saying Nadia is like this - in fact he's likely NOT like this (especially since he explained why the powepak wasn't a solution) - but I was pointing out that now that the powerpak is out there is no purpose in having devcards any longer. I'm sure more than one people came on this forum for that.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=38">Bregalad</a> — Wed Aug 18, 2010 10:39 am</p><hr />

Yeah, the Willem burner is the "el cheapo" ROM burner.  If you're only burning a couple types of EPROM, and not very often at that, it's worth it.  You do have to mess around with jumpers and dipswitches, but that only matters if you're using a bunch of different chips.<br /><br />Still, I'm sure you could get the convenience of a chinese-made USB burner for basically the same price, like arfink said.  Probably a better idea.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=10">Memblers</a> — Tue Aug 17, 2010 3:09 pm</p><hr />

IMO, having the programming hardware is a real nice thing if you're into DIY hardware stuff. I know alot of people here are all about the code and don't care so much about doing hardware for the sheer fun of it. Also useful if you do more stuff than NES, IE, Neo Geo development, or tinkering with arcade boards etc.<br /><br />There are some Chinese programmers, specifically one made by Genius, that go for about $40 to $50 shipped and are USB enabled. If you can make do with software that's partially in Chinese or badly translated into english then it's a great option for hobby use.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=450">arfink</a> — Tue Aug 17, 2010 1:58 pm</p><hr />

For a cheap buy decent programmer you are probably looking to spend around $100USD. The PowerPAK costs $135. Basically unless you are a pirate or a software developer making their own cartridges, the PowerPAK is the better buy. There are "cheap" EPROM programmers but they require an older PC with a parallel port and more knowledge to operate them correctly.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=1726">MottZilla</a> — Tue Aug 17, 2010 1:34 pm</p><hr />
