Either it becomes bulkier or the colours are wrong or whatever.<br /><br />Just take a look at the original NDS and compare it to the Lite version released not that long after. Why couldn't they have made that the original? Don't tell me they couldn't have done it like that because they could have.<br /><br />I respect that with the GB -&gt; GBC the technology increased significantly so that a better product could be released but otherwise, its just a rip-off.<br /><br />What do you guys think? Do you agree with me or are you gonna point out that this is another one of those mad rants of mine?

Why did they release a console they decided within 2 years needed to be redesigned?<br /><br />Just look at sales of the PSX when it was relaunched. The point is since then these companies have realised the wealth of re-releasing a console.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />No, I don't agree with you. I'm saying they designed the DS as best they could at the time. 2 years later it's due for at least a minor redesign to accomodate cheaper/faster/lower-power chip upgrades, plus they have two years worth of feedback from people using the device. Of course they're going to do a better design job the second time around. Also, launching a revised version of the console is good for marketing. Gets you a lot more attention than just silently improving the insides and not telling anybody.

Even harder if you don't want to get scooped in the first place.<br /><br />Some things also actually get smaller with time, and it's easier to build things closer to tolerances after you already have a known-good production run.<br /><br />Could they have released the DSlite in the first place? Sure, except for the screenâ€”screen technology changed radically in terms of what was available for a given quantity of money in that two year window. (And still is, actually). But it would have been riskier and would have involved throwing out millions of units if they'd had any late-breaking mistakes they needed to fix.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I'm personally a big fan of &quot;second-revised&quot; consoles. I almost only have them, the only console I have fat is the SNES and PS2, SNES because the lite version was only released in japan, and PS2 because it's actually my Sister's but I'd really like to own a PS2 slim instead. My brother has a slim one since he left home.<br /><br />I even imported a toploader NES all the way from USA, because no revised NES was released in Europe. And since then I only use it it is way better than the original product in almost every way. Although now I regret not having imported an AV Famicom from Japan and a 72-&gt;60 adapter, would have been more expensive but worth it.<br /><br />Now I agree when more than one single revision comes out, when the revisions comes less than 3 years after the original and when the revision lacks features of the original, it is too much.<br />The Gameboy Micro, DSi and DSi XL were too much. The PS-One (is this what you're mentioning ?) and the PS2 slim and PS3 slim, and the USA Toploader/AV Famicom are without any doubt better than the original product, and couldn't have been made with the technology of the year the originals were released.

I do own more redesigned consoles than that, but I'm only listing the ones for which I do not own the original version.

Don't these companies do some testing with members of the public before a console is released? Of course they do and I respect that 50 product testers are never going to be able to beat 50,000,000 users after the console is released.<br /><br />I have also said that I know that technology progresses over time and to be fair computers are getting smaller all of the time. But when every console nowadays gets a re-release less than 2 years after it's initial release it is a total rip-off. Its now almost standard practice. And what about when they add a camera or some other features? People who bought the console on day 1 are getting left out. I get the feeling the companies are holding back on the real product until billions have been spent by gamers.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">tepples wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">One problem is that sometimes, console revisions make it harder to get homebrew running.</div><br /><br />Yep. Thats what they want.
