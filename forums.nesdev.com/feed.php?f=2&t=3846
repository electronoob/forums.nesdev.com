There are two perspectives: the horizontal field, as seen in Tecmo Bowl, and the vertical field, as seen in Touchdown Fever. If you take the Touchdown Fever approach, you can make the guys 8 pixels wide like in Smash TV, and then you usually have about 7 of them on one line, so there isn't too much of a problem.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=9">tepples</a> — Tue Apr 15, 2008 6:32 pm</p><hr />

i've been writing a scripting engine to describe the player AI in the gridiron football game i've been working on. the premise behind it is that for each play i have 11 pointers to what is internally referred to as "behaviors." so to line up in the I-formation:<br /><br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">;       W<br />;<br />;       T<br />;       G<br />;    HFQC<br />;       G<br />;       T<br />;       E<br />;<br />;      W<br />off_form_I:<br />   .dw _off_QB_PosUnderCenter, _off_RB_PosAsHB, _off_RB_PosAsFB<br />   .dw _off_WR_PosSplitEndTop, _off_WR_PosFlankerBot, _off_TE_PosAsTEBot<br />   .dw _off_ol_PosAsLT, _off_ol_PosAsLG, _off_ol_PosAsC, _off_ol_PosAsRG, _off_ol_PosAsRT<br /></div><br /><br />copy the above pointers into the "script pointer" field for each of the player structs. now behaviors are further broken down into "commands."<br /><br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">_off_QB_PosUnderCenter:   .db SET_POS_FROM_BALL, $10, $00<br />   .db QB_STANCE<br />_off_QB_PosShotgun:   .db SET_POS_FROM_BALL, $40, $00<br />   .db QB_STANCE<br /></div><br /><br />so those two commands position the the player 16 and 64 pixels (respectively) away from the ball (x-coor) followed by setting their stance. 8 pixels = 1 yard. after the positioning scripts are ran for the formation, the scripts pointers for that particular play are written.<br /><br /><br />commands are grouped based on what they do. ex $Cx commands handle placement/movement:<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">...<br />SET_POS_FROM_BALL      equ $C0   ; SET_POS_FROM_BALL &#40;signed byte x, signed byte y&#41;<br />SET_POS_FROM_SCREEN   equ $C1   ; SET_POS_FROM_SCREEN &#40;signed byte x, byte y&#41;<br />MOVE_ABS   equ $C2   ; MOVE_ABS &#40;byte x, byte y&#41;<br />MOVE_ABS_FAR   equ $C3   ; MOVE_ABS_FAR &#40;word x, byte y&#41;<br />MOVE_REL   equ $C4   ; MOVE_REL &#40;signed byte x, singed byte y&#41;<br />MOVE_REL_FAR   equ $C5   ; MOVE_REL_FAR &#40;signed word x, singed byte y&#41;<br />...<br /></div><br /><br />every $2x is a random jump from the current behavior to another behavior. this allows for a degree of randomness in defensive coverage, offensive blocking, turnovers, etc. $Fx commands simulate control statements like loops or if-then/if-then-else.<br /><br />the problem i have is speed. so far i have a big switch that first decides the type of command with a series of cmp VAL and bcs THERE. THERE is an entry in a jump table. from there it further compares to find the exact command (like say SET_POS_FROM_BALL and SET_POS_FROM_SCREEN). these two commands share most of the same code except FROM_BALL first converts the x-coor argument into the equivilent FROM_SCREEN x-coor argument. MOVE_ABS and MOVE_REL are similar in that they fill the high byte with the high byte of the camera position and jump to their _FAR equivilents.<br /><br />this seems to be the most straight forward way to do it, but as more and more gamplay features are added, as well as a second team, i know that a series of compares is not gonna cut it. i'm reluctant to use a pointer table for all 255 possible commands because some commands are exactly the same (like $2x) except for the argument. i also have about 64 commands that are really only 4 commands just with the target player changed. ex:<br /><br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">HANDOFF_QB   equ $50<br />HANDOFF_HB   equ $51<br />HANDOFF_FB   equ $52<br />HANDOFF_WR1   equ $53<br />...<br /></div><br /><br />on top of the AI processing for 22 players, there is the conversion from absolute positions into screen positions. though much simpler then tokumaru's <a href="http://nesdev.com/bbs/viewtopic.php?t=3772&amp;start=0" class="postlink">situation</a> since i only scroll left and right. it just seems like all the compares/branches will really take a toll on speed once i start adding other things that need to be handled.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=187">never-obsolete</a> — Fri Jan 18, 2008 1:23 pm</p><hr />
