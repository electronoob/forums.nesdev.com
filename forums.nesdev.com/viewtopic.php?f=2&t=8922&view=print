<br />Some sort of API would be cool. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" />

<br />This is not entirely true, a lot of the GUI code is on the CF and is loaded as needed at $400-7FF as modules. The firmware (at $8000-FFFF) contains some often used routines like stuff for reading from CF etc. As far as I can remember it also uses CHR-RAM (at least it would make little sense to have a separate CHR-ROM chip on the cart for the firmware...) so it's definitely possible to write a module to load a different font.
<br />
<br />It would, theoretically, be possible to replace the entire GUI just by modifying the files on the CF as well. The firmware always starts by loading a certain module from the CF card, so replace that with a module that loads a new FPGA configuration and the PRG-ROM (really RAM) from the CF (similar to how games are loaded), and you have got a replacement menu. However nothing about this stuff is documented, and personally I don't feel it's worth the trouble. You would pretty much have to rewrite everything.

<br />
<br />The real problem is the cursor moving so slowly and that goes pixel-by-pixel instead of switching directly to the next line of text like you'd except it to.
<br />Also the cursor is way too close to the edge of the TV and partially hidden on my PAL TV.
<br />
<br />Fortunately you can reload the last used ROM with the start button so this makes things easier.

<br />Do you know you can use left/right instead of up/down to move the cursor faster?

<br />
<br />It is still an excelant piece of hardware none the less.

<br />Would be cool(?) to be able to embed some kind of boxart for the ROM's on the CF. Imagine a custom 4K CHR-bank attached with "nametable" for the front coverart, being loaded when you "hover" the pointer over a ROM. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":-)" title="Smile" />

It's not adding the GUI would be hard, it's be simple once you understood the existing program. But, he didn't use jump tables for routines and each routine basically HAS to be in the same spot for each update. Makes it 10x harder to work with it, so I have up the thought of attempting it, especially without a PP to begin with.
