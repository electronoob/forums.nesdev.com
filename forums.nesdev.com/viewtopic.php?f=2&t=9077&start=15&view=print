For example, this is what you'd do to retrieve the index of a free object slot and remove it from the linked list:<br /><br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">&nbsp; &nbsp;ldx FirstFreeSlot ;get the index of the first free slot<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;lda NextFreeSlot, x ;get the index of the second free slot<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;sta FirstFreeSlot ;make the second free slot the first one</div><br />See? Now X holds the index of the slot that the new object can use. Maybe this is even faster than manipulating bits that indicate what's free and what's not, because accessing individual bits in a byte isn't so trivial. <br /><br />Later, when the object is done, the reverse operations will free the slot and put it back at the start of the linked list:<br /><br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">&nbsp; &nbsp;lda FirstFreeSlot ;get the index of the first free slot<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;sta NextFreeSlot, x ;save it as the second free slot<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;stx FirstFreeSlot ;make the current slot the first free one</div><br />BTW, "NextFreeSlot" is just an alias for one of the attributes of the objects. Since the slot is free, the bytes that would otherwise be used for holding the state of the object (health, meta sprite pointer, whatever) are free to be used by the linked list.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">You could use 8 bytes to indicate which OAM slot is free as well. Is this too many branches/loops to find the next free?</div>
<br />IMO, yes. I avoid "searching" as much as I can in my programs. As for the OAM in particular, there are several good cycling algorithms that don't require slots to be marked as used/free. 64 may not sound like much, but a loop with that many iterations will surely make a difference in CPU usage, so actually filling the slots already takes a significant amount of time, you really don't want to add in the time necessary to manipulate bits with slow masking operations.

<br />
<br />You would simply have to initialize each NextFreeSlot at the beginning of a game/level which I suppose is trivial.

<br />Exactly. You'd make NextFreeSlot point to slot 0 and then loop through all the slots writing increasing indexes starting from 1 to their NextFreeSlot variables. I use a negative number to indicate the end of the list (since I don't plan on having more than 128 slots!). Like you pointed out, the initialization of the list is only necessary once at the beginning of the level.

<br />
<br />I also have this huge-ass subroutine that I call "physics," and what it does is, apply gravity and calculate BG collision with objects automatically.  For if you have a "koopa" ememy, all you have to do is move his x coordinate a pixel to the left, then "jsr physics," and he will fall off a platform when he reaches a ledge, and will stop when he runs into a wall.
