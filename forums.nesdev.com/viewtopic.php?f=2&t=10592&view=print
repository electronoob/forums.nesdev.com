		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Hello there.<br />I was trying to play Putt Putt Golf for the Famicom Disk System but when it shows the course, the game locks up. The music still plays but the rest of the game locks up here. I tried it on VirtuaNES and it worked fine but to my knowledge, you can't hack games/search for cheats on VirtuaNES. I was just wondering if there was a way to get the game working on FCEUX? I thought I heard something about editing a certain RAM or ROM address to get it to work but I don't know. I also downloaded all the ROM files I could find and that didn't work either. Thanks for your time!

Also, the memory viewer in VirtuaNES' text is so small I can't read it.<br /><br />I tried VirtuaNES' cheat search but I can't really figure it out. All I need is a code to always get a hole in one.<br /><br />Update: I found the cheat, but it sucks you can't freeze the address like FCEUX.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Well, debugger could be hooked up to Nestopia or implemented (as Nestopia is open source) or you could just do debugger in the rom that would produce dump after pressing certain key combination (like left+select+b). This dump could be sent to screen, each frame different dump page and you could record it and examine frame by frame. I've read somewhere that was what people who made games in 80s did (recording was obviously using VHS or that tape format used in Japan). They literally put debugger into game itself which was then removed (in most cases at least).<br /><br />And in Nestopia you get almost 100% accuracy (certain games doesn't work, like Sachen's Pyramid though).<br /><br />Also you missing point - OP was looking for emulator to play games and not develop them, so he doesn't need any debug capabilities - for cheating, you can input game genie codes into Nestopia and search for cheats which is enough for OP's needs.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />This is Nes<strong>Dev</strong> forum. tepples, as one of well known homebrew devs here, just noted that it isn't the best emulator for devs, as it lacks debugging features. Although they could be added into the emulator, no one is up to this task. A good debugger, at least comparable to FCEUX's one, is not easy to add into an emulator 'after the fact'. A debugger built into a game is in no way that helpful or useful. Not even really doable in many cases.

That's good for some things, but for others, you really need to be able to step through the program instruction by instruction. Including a 6502-on-6502 emulator like the one kevtris wrote for CopyNES might be a bit overkill.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">I've read somewhere that was what people who made games in 80s did (recording was obviously using VHS or that tape format used in Japan).
