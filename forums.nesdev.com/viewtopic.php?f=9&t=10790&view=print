I was viewing pictures of the cart online and noticed that the PRG ROM chip is what appears to be an EPROM.<br /><br />I am no fan of the EPROM chips, as they erase themselves over time. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" alt=":(" title="Sad" /> <br /><br />So, my question here is to anyone who has recently purchased this cart: Do they still contain this type of chip?<br /><br />I have noticed that the newer Battle Kid 2 contains no windowed chips, so I am suspecting that RetroZone in now using one-time burnable ROMs instead.<br /><br />Also, what memory management controller do the Battle Kid games use?<br /><br />Thanks! <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />

They will still suffer from bitrot over (a long) time.<br /><br />The good news is that you can just overwrite any eprom with the data thats supposed to be on there to &quot;refresh&quot; it, that is if it has suffered from bitrot. Don't even have to erase it.

Both have comparable total reprogramming cycles. The only difference between them is one of them is less tedious to reprogram later.<br /><br />The set-up cost for a Mask ROM (as you are implying you want) is sufficiently large it's apparently not even close to economically feasible until you're ordering ICs in quantities of millions.

Battletoads doesn't have an MMC, VRC, FME, or any other ASIC mapper, yet it's a large game. Instead, it has a couple tiny <strong>un</strong>assuming <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/7400_series" class="postlink">7400 series</a> integrated circuits that act as the mapper. A &quot;discrete&quot; mapper built out of 7400 ICs is <strong>un</strong>able to provide quite as many services as an ASIC, but in some games, those services are <strong>un</strong>necessary. This way, the manufacturer is <strong>un</strong>burdened with the higher cost of an ASIC.

The situation evolved since the '80s though.<br /></div>That's my point (the anymore bit). Most ROM manufactureres don't even manufacture mask ROMs anymore. It's just not worth it unless they're all spinning up a mask for an entirely new silicon die for other functionality (e.g. microcontroller, northbridge, whatever) and even then, most manufacturers have taken to preferred programmable memory to be able to fix things in case something is broken. Nintendo may well be the last company to have had short-ish runs of bare mask roms, in DS cartridges (although I remember someone insinuating they might have programmable too)—everyone else wanted some kind of cryptographic lock with it, or wanted reprogrammability, or had quantities of millions.<br /><div class="quotetitle">98digger wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">Also, the EPROM in the official stock picture of the cart has no sticker or tape over it.

You might be worried if the EPROM was programmed a long time ago, but a recently programmed one isn't going to be erased unless you make a habit of leaving it out. <br /><br />I don't think I've seen any Battle Kid cartridge pictures that show the use of an UV EPROM. Even if they did, the colored cartridge case will provide some protection and if you store it in the black dust sleeve that is common it will be just fine. But I think most if not all Battle Kid cartridges (excluding bootlegs) probably use EEPROMs.
