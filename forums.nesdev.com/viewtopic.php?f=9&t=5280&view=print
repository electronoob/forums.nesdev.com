<br />
<br />Does anyone (kevtris? <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />) have pinout info for the MMC3 clone chip marked AX5202P, which is used in some pirate cartridges? I have a couple of carts with that chip and the pinout would be helpful in figuring out how they work.

<br />
<br />According to kevtris' tests, it's 100% functionally compatible with the original MMC3.  Though I wonder if it can help any with battery-backup.
<br />
<br />BTW man, I remember you from the NESdev email list.  That was a while back huh?

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Sorry to necro another old post! But i recently got my hands on about 10 of these AX5202p chips. I designed a basic TLROM board and tested with &quot;Little Nemo: The Dream Master&quot;, and sadly only 4 of the chips work! The others either don't load at all, crash after selecting Start Game, or have completely messed up graphics. I've heard that some of these MMC3 clones can be a little hit and miss, but for half of a lot to not work is brutal odds.<br /><br />So, my question is how or what would cause these chips not to work anymore, and in differing ways? As far as I can see these were new (well, new old stock anyways), so it can't have been from misuse. Or, is it possible that these AX5202p chips have different pinouts/functions?

Try them with <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/viewtopic.php?p=120164#p120164" class="postlink">Holy Diver Batman</a>; does anything but IRQ (third digit of result code) fail on them?

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I had the same problem, out of the 10 that I tested, only 2 worked, some where partially working.  Funniest one was where everything but IRQ worked, so SMB3 was playable without the status bar.  I have some more tubes of them that weren't tested.  It didn't look very promising, plus I don't have a board for it (was using a friends' board when we tried those 10), I never bothered to make one.<br /><br />I don't know if we could ever know for sure, but my theory is that all the good chips were built into carts years ago, these were from a known bad batch that was set aside and never used, or were thrown out and someone pulled them from the trash.  I have a hard time believing that that many defects could be normal, but I suppose that's possible too.

They came in a tube in a static-free bag, so I'm not sure what could have happened there... I spoke with the place I bought them from and they told me &quot;they can't be faulty, the manufacturer has said they were new and unused&quot;, but they sure appear faulty to me...<br /><br />BTW, the ones that do that blue garbled screen also get very hot after a minute, and have a scrolling humbar vertically. Almost what you'd expect if you reversed VCC and GND or something, but the chip was inserted correctly.
