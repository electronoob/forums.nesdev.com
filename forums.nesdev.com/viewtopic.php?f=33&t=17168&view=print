So something should be done to get some original sound effects in there.  Multidude uses other sound effects from alterego, but I'm guessing shiru has open sourced those for cc use with some of his other audio works.  <br /><br />I did find a quick bug in multidude in the 3rd level, if you walk to the upper left corner you're permanently stuck and have to reset.

If we'd like to include them, at this point it's probably best to reach out to the developer and ask if they're interested in reworking the games to allow them to be included.  Possible permission could be acquired to use alterego assests, but SMB assets are out of the question.  They may very well not have any interest in getting their work on the cart to motivate reworking the audio.

I don't know who's credited for sfx in the NES version though.<br /><br /> I didn't want to be presumptive and reach out to him before hand. But his contact is at the link above.<br /><br />I actually made quite a bit of Multidude art for a third party that was planning to do a US cart release of it a year or two ago, but those plans kind of fizzled out. I hope he'd be interested in putting the titles on A53.<br /><br />Are there other titles in consideration? I'd like to get a headstart brainstorming the cover art.

But I don't think the lack of compatability this would give to the rest of the games on the cart with famiclones would make it worthwhile..<br /><br />Nemesys has reached out to me privately and offered <a href="http://nemesys.atspace.com/alienes/trade.html" class="postlink">Trade</a> to be included on volume 4.  I've only spent a small amount of time with the game so far, but it's pretty interesting and looks to be a welcome inclusion IMO.

He mentioned that he's working to include an in game manual/instructions.  I don't think we should have to do anything special to the menu in regards to the instructions.
