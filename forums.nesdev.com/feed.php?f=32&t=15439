I don't feel I really have a dog in the fight that justifies me voting, IMO voting is best left to people planning to submit an entry or who feel very strongly.  You can probably guess what I would vote based on my comments, but I don't feel strongly enough to justify a vote.<br /><br />It's a bummer that we didn't do a better job announcing the competition on nintendo age.  Regardless of if we extend or not, we should take that as a lesson learned and make sure we are announcing things both here and on Nintendo age in the future.<br /><br />While I can see the argument for extending due to this over sight, I really question how many entries we'll gain by extending another month.  Do we actually have anyone on NA who was unaware of the competition until just now and plans to put something together in such a short amount of time?  If such an actual person exists, then there's merit to extending.  If not, then there kinda needs to be another reason to extend besides effectively not announcing the compo in a NA thread.<br /><br />Something I was pushing for when we were arranging 2016 compo was a more regular annual compo schedule.  One that had the same annual deadline year in year out.  That way it could be somewhat counted on by new people joining the community.  If they're getting involved late in the year then maybe they just start working on next year's compo early.  Perhaps the guys on NA that are bummed about not being informed about the compo should really be thinking about starting work on a submission for Jan 2018.  Last compo we decided that 3 months really wasn't enough time, so I question how we would now think that 1 month might be enough time to increase the number of entries.<br /><br />That all said.  Whatever the deadline is decided to be, it's not like the submitted games are getting flashed onto the vol3 of Action53 the next day, week, or even month most likely.  I'm hoping we will expedite the judging process much like was done last compo so as not to leave everyone on the edge of their seats awaiting results.  Based on history, there will be a decent amount of time for developers to correct any found bugs, or modify/censor/etc anything that might disqualify their entry from being included on the cartridge.  Last compo there was a better part of a year that passed while collecting up enough games to fill the cart.  Not sure if we'll take that same approach this year.  But my point is, if someone is planning on putting a game together over the course of the next month, we will welcome them to include their game on the cartridge.  The only real loss of a submission that's a month past the deadline is chance to win placing prizes.  They would still get a contributor's limited edition cartridge or any other entry prizes awarded to all submissions.  Perhaps that's enough consolation for anyone who missed out on the compo announcement?<br /><br />EDIT: It might be a good idea to include a proposed date for poll as yes/no without a date is somewhat ambiguous.  Should the deadline be extended the next thing we'll struggle with is deciding when.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=4832">infiniteneslives</a> — Tue Jan 24, 2017 11:36 pm</p><hr />
