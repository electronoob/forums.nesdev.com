And they believe that moving forward the NES/Famicom console format should be entirely headerless.  It appears that they have put all their eggs into certain communities or emulator authors' unwilling baskets to support this overall effort; if you do something en masse it's up to the world as a whole to adapt to the change.<br /><br />Since flash carts are becoming the enthusiasts option of choice, we know that a headerless format for the NES/Famicom would be entirely impossible unless processors/fpga-ish devices become faster/smaller/cooler and memory becomes cheaper.  With current technology a NES/Famicom flash cart needs headers.  Not only to this fact, but a header format takes the burden off emulator coders to database games themselves, keep up-to-date with good/bad dumps, allow dumps to be released without updating their code, allows not having to rely on a databasing community for updates to their database, and frankly allows a life outside of NES development.  The NES/Famicom console ROM dump format and emulation could be much more intensive without the simple yet necessary innovation of the iNES header.<br /><br />No-Intro could in fact be the agent to bring alive the NES 2.0 format or even beta-test the DotFami format.  Instead it seems that they want to steer NES/Famicom into the dark.<br /><br />As quoted by a No-Intro administrator <a href="http://forums.no-intro.org/viewtopic.php?f=2&amp;t=2275" class="postlink">in a thread</a> by someone else attempting to make the effort to fix the NES/Famicom headers:<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">BigFred wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">I basically agree but the main goal was a completely headerless format. Just datting PRG/CHR and providing an external XML with header info accessible by emulators. I think it can be done with Nestopia or MESS.</div><br />I mean no disrespect to anyone, but my goal is to hopefully steer them away from this asynchronous step that is just doing more harm than good.

As I understand it, a ROM might look like this:<br /><ul><li>thwaite.prg: 16384 bytes </li><li>thwaite.chr: 8192 bytes </li><li>thwaite.board is an XML representation of the data in the iNES or NES 2.0 header </li></ul>Is it that an 8-bit CPU has more trouble processing the XML representation than, say, NES 2.0? Or what else am I missing?<br /><br />Anyway, you might want to mention that the maintainers of the NES 2.0 spec itself (kevtris and myself) are more easily contactable than Quietust. You might mention that the iNES format is in essence an archive format, just as zip and tar are archive formats. The header specifies whether certain predefined objects (PRG RAM trainer, PRG ROM, CHR ROM) are present and how big they are, and it's followed by the objects in that order.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Well, opening this discussion has brought that to mind.  I'm glad that you and kevtris are available for comment and aid.  Quietust was a valuable source of information; and still makes a good emulator on the DL.<br /><br />We have to consider that a flash cart will always be preferred to an emulator.  Will a flash cart on older hardware be able to decompress 2 to 4 files and then look at an XML file, as in son-of-a-ZapFC to tell how the mapping logic and expansion chips function with given current technology and then be produced for a commercial market?  Even so, that XML file is more or less a header but not existing at one end of the archived file.  My conclusion is that something other than the PRG, CHR, and possibly sample ICs needs to exist to tell the emulator or hardware what to do with the file.  And if it's a small header or XML file that exists in the archive, why not just keep headers and use the most useful databasing community as a vehicle to increase the capability and compatibility of that set of dumped images to aid the emulation and new commercial, NES/Famicom hardware.

This entails a lot off legwork but ensures to give emulator authors incentive to support NES 2.0.  Since NES 2.0 is already proven to work and is more or less complete, I believe it's the format we should turn toward so we can continue dumping and emulating previously undiscovered NES/Famicom software without running out of mapper numbers.  This way it could also make a lot of room for community custom mapper numbers to be assigned and developed under.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I like NES 2.0, I was just saying I don't really see iNES 1.0 as obsolete yet. It works pretty well for most games, and emulators have workarounds for most of the ones that don't. We'll need new mapper IDs eventually, but there's still a few left for the time being.<br /><br />Homebrew comes out slowly, but most (all?) homebrew is for existing mappers. I've seen a lot of custom mapper ideas being thrown around, but I haven't yet seen somebody actually make a game with one (if you know any, list them). We've got a slow stream of increasingly obscure games popping up with new mappers (esp. unlicensed chinese carts), but I don't imagine homebrew will be pushing the spec much.<br /><br />DotFami is an interesting idea, but ultimately I kinda dislike the custom/generic mapper concept. I mean, I like the idea that it might account for new mapper configurations that we may need in the future, but I think it's just as likely that something new will come up requiring a spec revision and reimplementation. I think it would also be subject to homebrew abuse which may expose and complicate the internal implementation (compare: NSF multi-expansion). I much prefer the simplicity of an order-by-number mapper like you get with iNES.

Size of PRG RAM and CHR RAM is the first big stumbling block. Original iNES supports SNROM and SUROM fine, but there's no widely supported way to specify the extra PRG RAM of SOROM and SXROM, and at least one homebrew release by Neil Baldwin needs the extra RAM of the SXROM board. An MMC3 board can be rewired to support large CHR RAM, but not in original iNES.

I think rips should be the PRG and CHR files and another file describing the other stuff, and then combine them together into the formats needed such as NES 2.0, UNIF, DotFami, and so on; you could uncombine them if necessary (although it might not be necessary). It just seems more logical to me to rip the ROMs separately and then combine them (including the header) afterward (which can be before they are published; when you need to send the files to anyone, only the combined files are necessary).
