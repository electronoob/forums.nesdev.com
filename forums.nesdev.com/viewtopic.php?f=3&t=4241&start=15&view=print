<br />
<br />I could always try to put the default setting and take some screen shots if that could help.
<br />
<br />I just need to know a list of games that the issue is more obvious. As long as I have the game, I can test it.  But a 1998 tv is still not a tv from the famicom era so I don't know if the test would be conclusive or not.

<br />Any game that starts out with title screens or first areas that use yellowish colors (of hues $7 and $8 especially, but $6 and $9 are also affected) or bright skin tones are good test games.  Here's a small list of such, by their Japanese names first, then American names if different:
<br />
<br /><ul><li>Double Dragon (the Kanji characters in the title screen are yellowish, and the first level uses yellowish BGs and skin tones for some enemies)</li><li>Double Dragon II (the "II" in the title screen is yellowish, and skin tones)</li><li>Gimmick! (yellow stripes in the title screen and the first level)</li><li>Senjou no Ookami {戦場の狼} (aka Commando, the skin tone of the gray enemy soldiers)</li><li>Hitler no Fukkatsu: Top Secret {ヒットラーの復活: Top Secret} (aka Bionic Commando, the yellowish bricks of area 1 and the skin tones of the playfield characters)</li><li>Gun-Dec (aka Vice: Project Doom, skin tones and some colors in the first level)</li><li>Crisis Force (skin tones in the intro, yellow land in the first level)</li></ul>
<br />
<br />Actually, I doubt you'd even need a list - probably any and all of the games you have can be good test games.

<br />
<br />But I do remember that some of them did seems more yellowish than what I remembered when I had them on my original nes.  I will try to reset the settings of the tv just to make sure that it doesn't compromise the tests, but I guess we never changed them once we received it so it should be in it's normal position already.

<br />
<br />Edit: 
<br />
<br />I just came back and I had a chance to check the model. It's a 1997 Toshiba 21R77.  This is the only information on the back for the model number. No specific series or anything. In brief, a very basic tv.

<br />Senjou no ookami
<br /><img src="http://i389.photobucket.com/albums/oo335/banshaku/01.jpg" alt="Image" />
<br />This one, the picture is not great. Cannot see. Not that yellowish.
<br />
<br />Double dragon
<br /><img src="http://i389.photobucket.com/albums/oo335/banshaku/02.jpg" alt="Image" /><img src="http://i389.photobucket.com/albums/oo335/banshaku/03.jpg" alt="Image" />
<br />The yellow tone is a little bit more obvious
<br />
<br />Double dragon 2
<br /><img src="http://i389.photobucket.com/albums/oo335/banshaku/04.jpg" alt="Image" /><img src="http://i389.photobucket.com/albums/oo335/banshaku/05.jpg" alt="Image" />
<br />This one, not really.
<br />
<br />Hilter no fukkatsu: top secret
<br /><img src="http://i389.photobucket.com/albums/oo335/banshaku/06.jpg" alt="Image" /><img src="http://i389.photobucket.com/albums/oo335/banshaku/07.jpg" alt="Image" />
<br />You cannot pause the damn game and see the game play so it was a hard one to take.
<br />
<br />Crisis force
<br /><img src="http://i389.photobucket.com/albums/oo335/banshaku/08.jpg" alt="Image" /><img src="http://i389.photobucket.com/albums/oo335/banshaku/09.jpg" alt="Image" />
<br /><img src="http://i389.photobucket.com/albums/oo335/banshaku/10.jpg" alt="Image" />
<br />Seems a little bit yellowish
<br />
<br />Gun-dec
<br /><img src="http://i389.photobucket.com/albums/oo335/banshaku/11.jpg" alt="Image" /><img src="http://i389.photobucket.com/albums/oo335/banshaku/12.jpg" alt="Image" />
<br /><img src="http://i389.photobucket.com/albums/oo335/banshaku/13.jpg" alt="Image" /><img src="http://i389.photobucket.com/albums/oo335/banshaku/14.jpg" alt="Image" />
<br /><img src="http://i389.photobucket.com/albums/oo335/banshaku/15.jpg" alt="Image" /><img src="http://i389.photobucket.com/albums/oo335/banshaku/16.jpg" alt="Image" />
<br />These batch doesn't comes out as clear as I expected. The building are yellowish. The enemies a little bit.
<br />
<br />
<br />I still have the originals pictures. At 2 megs each, I couldn't put them online and I don't think my ISP would like it since I put them on my personal page.
<br />
<br />I had to do them very fast, the battery of the digital camera was dying. I don't know how long I will be able to keep them online.
<br />
<br />But my setting was very improvised.  Dark room to avoid light, basic digital camera, my hand where shaking even on a chair+box so it was not the ideal setting.  
<br />
<br />The settings of the TV are all reset to zero, except for one called "unicolor" in japanese. If you increase it, it boots the color. In that case, the yellowish tone becomes more obvious but it must be because the colors becomes over saturated.
<br />
<br />I hope these pictures will help you.  I can take more someday if I can find the time to do it.

<br />edit:
<br />
<br />If we want to keep those pictures for future reference, where could I host them?  Like I said, I don't know how much my ISP will like me to keep them on my personal web page (even thought for now I don't really take care of that site).  It would be a shame to lose them if someone want to see that specific information again.

<br />I followed your advice and updated the message. Thanks for the tip.  Still, my concern is if this site goes down, we lose the content.

Depending on when TV set manufacturers started taking that into account, their color decoding will "suddenly" change.
<br />
<br />Based on those pictures, I don't think the TV boosts anything at all:
<br /><ul><li>If red boost was active, the yellows wouldn't look as greenish as they do in the pictures.</li><li>If yellow boost was active, color 0x36 would look orange instead of pinkish. In the Double Dragon I title screen shot, the fire above the "© 1988 Technos Japan Corp" looks orange for 0x26, but then pinkish for 0x36, a clear sign of no "yellow boost".</li></ul>All in all, the Toshiba 21R77 seems to have very accurate NTSC-J decoding without any boosting or questionable "improvement" going on whatsoever.
