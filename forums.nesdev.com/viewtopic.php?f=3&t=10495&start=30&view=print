MS-DOS most likely only made use of the most basic features that every video card was supposed to offer (it's only text after all!) but any program that wished to use more advanced features would probably have to look for a &quot;signature&quot; indicating that said features are indeed present.

They provide a set of globally provided functions (&quot;interrupts&quot; at the time, &quot;syscalls&quot; in modern parlance) that abstract away much of the lower-level functionality. It's just that the scale and scope of these functions were very limited, especially compared to the entirety of Win32s.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">Arsonizer wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">How does the processor/graphics card make sure that the write is received as a write to the expected register, even though there are multiple possibly connected cards with different registers/behavior?<br /></div>For the x86, there are two separate memory spaces: RAM and I/O. They're both readable and writeable, but the latter can't be executed from. Also, because the I/O space is distinct, there's very few configuration registers in RAM (they're almost all in the I/O space instead).<br />So drawing pixels onscreen was almost always some variant on &quot;call [System Call Interface] 0x10 with configuration parameters, allow video card BIOS to set up screen, and then write data to memory starting at 0xa0000 (EGA and newer), 0xb0000 (MDA), or 0xb8000 (CGA).

Depending on exactly how they wrote the game, it might even quit cleanly with a &quot;where's my VGA?&quot;. Otherwise, because the VGA was specifically designed to put the majority of its configuration registers in a completely different location than the CGA, it's mostly likely the game would start, clear the screen, and then you'd be left with a blank text mode screen with a blinking cursor. You might hear the game music.

That game sure brings back some memories though. I used to play it on the PS1 as a kid, and I never managed to complete it at that time because it had no way of saving progress. You could collect some of those pots/urns or whatever and get a password, but I sucked as a kid and never got them. Ironically, this is one of those PS1 games that makes me want to get better at emulation so I can one day write a PS1 emu <img src="./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" />.
