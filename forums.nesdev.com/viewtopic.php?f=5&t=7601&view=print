It just adds the luminance signal to the chrominance signal assuming no valid RGB value can possibly go over the limit.

Some may cap the illegal colour at its outermost legal point, others might have overloading, wrap-around, who knows?  For example, on my Sharp TV, reds that are too strong change to purple or magenta?  On my video capture card, reds that are too strong become fiery orange, for some reason.

<br />After reading up awhile back on this a bunch,  it isn't well defined.  What I did read, however, said that you are supposed to saturate on decoding and clip on encoding.
<br />
<br />i.e.  if your chroma+luma exceeds the thresholds (too high or too low) you clip. 
<br />
<br />on decoding, if R, G, or B exceeds the maximum range, you clip.   It is possible I think to have a negative value for R, G, or B.  In which case you clip to 0.   This clipping can cause a colour shift if say, red saturates and green hasn't yet.  This could cause it to shift from red to orange as red pegs and more green is added.
<br />
<br />It's been about 3-4 months since I poked around with this stuff but that's what I remember.    Incidentally, finding information on how to actually encode/decode NTSC and PAL video was extremely difficult to do.  I ended up finding a book about it titled "Video demystified: a handbook for the digital engineer".  This book is extremely good and has everything you'd ever want to know about video processing in the digital domain.
<br />
<br />I used the info in it to make an FPGA RGB to NTSC/PAL video encoder.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I think at least one part of the reason for the restriction is when you're actually modulating content for OTA broadcast — i.e. not just over the little yellow composite cable — the broadcaster has to both 1- send a signal that complies with what the FCC says is ok and 2- deal with the AGC on the input to each television.
<br />1- I'm not certain how this would affect IRE levels; AFAICT, as long as the negative edge is above -40 IRE (sync) it should be ok.
<br />2- Because NTSC OTA is AM modualted, each television has to have an AGC to scale the input to the nominal levels. Since this scaling happens before colorspace conversion, it's possible this stage will distort all the colors towards desaturated black or oversaturated white if a hot color is present.
<br />
<br />And as a final anecdote, <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.linusakesson.net/scene/phasor/">http://www.linusakesson.net/scene/phasor/</a><!-- m --> did explicitly have problems with hot colors in his video generation (although his is PAL hot colors instead of NTSC).

<br />Except for the AV Famicom, the final batch of the NES 2, and a few machines based on an RGB PPU, every authentic NES modulates its video for broadcast.

So this explaines why the Disney Home VHS version of Disney movies always had brighter colors and darker blacks than the ABC7 print, and why NES/SNES games always bleed through other channels.
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />The reason I'm asked this is because I'm saving up for an FPGA board and in the meantime I'm planning everything out.  The way I have my RGB to NTSC converter layed out.
