The reason pin 51 (EXP9) was chosen was because this is the only pin which is unused in the Power Pak, and that pin exists in the <span class="posthilit">toploader</span> (pin 54 simply doesn't exist).<br /><img src="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/23465629/NES_junk/DSC00315.JPG" alt="Image" /><br />- Add a 1.2 kOhm resistor between pin 51 (EXP9) and <span class="posthilit">audio</span> out. The <span class="posthilit">audio</span> out pin is right next to pin 51 so it's really easy to solder the resistor here.<br /><img src="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/23465629/NES_junk/DSC00316.JPG" alt="Image" /><br />- If you want <span class="posthilit">audio</span> with actual FC games, you'd have to add a wire in the 60 -&gt; 72 pin converter, between pin 46 (60-pins FC side) and pin 51 (72-pins NES side).<br /><br />On a side note, I noticed the <span class="posthilit">audio</span> in the <span class="posthilit">toploader</span> is not amplified at all, it just comes straight out from the 2A03, through a set of resistors and capacitors. That's why I have to make the volume louder to compensate for that (as opposed to, for example, the SNES or <span class="posthilit">toploader</span> NES).

<br />Yes, you just need to add a wire on the PowerPak, and a wire in your 72-&gt;60 adapter. You'd have to add this wire anyways even with a front loading console, because those adapters were designed without expanded <span class="posthilit">audio</span> in mind and leave the <span class="posthilit">audio</span> pin disconnected on the Famicom side.
<br />
<br />The only difference is that <span class="posthilit">audio</span> is passed through pin 51 instead of the more common pin 54, because this pin does not exist in the NES2.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Yes you just have to add a resistor. In the frontloader mod you also just had to add a resistor so I just inspired myself from that.
<br />The only difference is that the <span class="posthilit">audio</span> is not amplified so you need a different (smaller) value for the resistor. I tried different values unless I figured out that 1.2k was the one who sounded the most right with my powerpak. A lower value would make external <span class="posthilit">audio</span> louder and a higher value would make it quieter.
<br />
<br />There is 3 pins going to the RF box (that I removed because I modded my console to support AV). GND, video and <span class="posthilit">audio</span>. You should solder the resistor directly to the <span class="posthilit">audio</span> pin. I know the quality of my pic is terrible (done with my cellphone...), but the <span class="posthilit">audio</span> pin is the closest to pin 51, to the right on the bottom of the board if you place it like on the pic.
<br />
<br />I hope you'll be able to mod your toloader, as I really like it better than frontloader personally, I imported one all the way from america and modified it to AV so I can play it on european TV just for that !

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />this is great stuff. If you get time, I would love to see a bigger pic of the solder points. I tried zooming in and the image isn't large enough. it just pixalates. 
<br />
<br />I wish there was a way not to have to mod the powerpak. like adding our our pin that we would re-route. 
<br />
<br />That or you have ask Bunnyboy at Retrozone to add the <span class="posthilit">audio</span> to both pin 54 and a jumper trace to pin 51 for the next revision on the Powerpak board.  That way both the toaster and the <span class="posthilit">toploader</span> can get the extra <span class="posthilit">audio</span> channels.

<br />"Easiest" way to get <span class="posthilit">audio</span> on pin 51 is to ask loopy to compile new versions of his mappers (or recompile it yourself, link to sources is somewhere in these boards), and make them output to pin 51 instead of 54.

<br />As mostly all Famicoms here were modded to output composite signals using AV. I remembered playing Topgun in my friend's home and the drums and the melody line of the music were played on different sides of the headphone. I'm not sure how that's done though as it seemed to me that the system was hacked to have different sound channels played on different sides, but now, on second thought it might be just modded so that the external <span class="posthilit">audio</span> came from one side and the internal <span class="posthilit">audio</span> came from the other(I think Topgun used external <span class="posthilit">audio</span>).
