		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Not sure if this is of any help to Blargg, but I devised MMX versions of two pixel processing algorithms he described on his website.
<br />
<br />The first was for averaging two 15-bit RGB pixels (<a href="http://www.slack.net/~ant/info/rgb_mixing.html" class="postlink">http://www.slack.net/~ant/info/rgb_mixing.html</a>). Here's the MMX equivalent I came up with to Blargg's C code, which averages two groups of four pixels each:
<br />
<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">;mm0 = first group of 4 packed pixels &#40;x&#41;<br />;mm1 = second group of 4 packed pixels &#40;y&#41;<br /><br />movq&nbsp; &nbsp;mm2, mm0<br />pxor&nbsp; &nbsp;mm2, mm1<br />pand&nbsp; &nbsp;mm2, &#91;mask&#93;&nbsp; ;mask = 0x0421042104210421<br />paddw&nbsp; mm0, mm1<br />paddw&nbsp; mm0, mm2&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;;use psubw for downward rounding instead<br />psrlw&nbsp; mm0, 1<br /><br />;mm0 now contains 4 averaged packed pixels<br /></div><br /><br />The second was for adding two 15-bit RGB pixels with clamping. Again, MMX allows this to be done on four sets of pixels at a time. Here's what I came up with:<br /><br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">;mm0 = first group of 4 packed pixels &#40;x&#41;<br />;mm1 = second group of 4 packed pixels &#40;y&#41;<br /><br />movq&nbsp; &nbsp;mm2, mm0<br />pxor&nbsp; &nbsp;mm2, mm1<br />pand&nbsp; &nbsp;mm2, &#91;mask1&#93;&nbsp; ;mask1 = 0x0421042104210421<br />paddw&nbsp; mm0, mm1<br />movq&nbsp; &nbsp;mm3, mm0<br />psubw&nbsp; mm3, mm2<br />pand&nbsp; &nbsp;mm3, &#91;mask2&#93;&nbsp; ;mask2 = 0x8420842084208420<br />psubw&nbsp; mm0, mm3<br />movq&nbsp; &nbsp;mm2, mm3<br />psrlw&nbsp; mm2, 5<br />psubw&nbsp; mm3, mm2<br />por&nbsp; &nbsp; mm0, mm3<br /><br />;mm0 now contains the clamped addition result<br /></div>
<br />
<br />I don't yet have code to test this in, but I've gone over it carefully and it should work, since it executes identical algorithms to Blargg's, but in parallel. If anyone manages to use this successfully, I'd be interested to hear about it.

<br />You lose pre-Intel Macs and really old IBM compatible PCs, but that's about it. Besides, you're right that keeping a more portable reference implementation around is a good idea.
<br />
<br />Josh: Wouldn't it be better to keep that mask in a register if possible so that you don't have to hit memory so often? Or does the paddw instruction provide adequate time to load the mask from cache?

<br />
<br />Yes the Famicom Titler is a much sought after version of the Famicom.  It is an official 3rd party clone, which supports S-video.  <a href="http://www.gamechoiceclub.com/navigateProduct.asp?product_id=544" class="postlink">Game Choice Club still sells Titlers</a>, but for a heft sum.  So in a sense, there is official NES hardware out there that can do S-video and RGB, i.e., the Titler and the arcade systems respectively.
<br />
<br />However, implementing optimizations, such as MMX seems to be more important right now.  If the filter can be made extremely fast, then you could have your cake and eat it to, for a new low low price <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />  That would virtually cement NTSC RGB as the default video setting in emulators like Nestopia.

<br />
<br />I mentioned this to Marty. The idea I pitched was to do away with the distinction and let Nestopia automatically use the standard fast blitter when the NTSC sliders are in the "crisp RGB" positions. There are various presets you can select, and the default would be the crisp RGB so that the standard blitter would be in effect by default.

<br />artifacts = sqrt( -1 );
<br />
<br />Seriously, I now have a PAL NES motherboard (thanks to Eli Dayan) but haven't taken the time to get my devcart serial routines adjusted for its differing clock rate. I don't have a PAL TV, but my video capture works with it at full PAL resolution, so I'll investigate it at some point (along with the PAL APU). Based on preliminary inspection of the image, it appears that the PAL artifacts repeat every 6 or so scanlines. Some people claim that the artifacts in PAL are pretty much invisible; if this is the case, the S-Video setting should work (with perhaps a hue adjustment). Someone familiar with how a PAL NES looks could do some comparisons.

What some laypeople mean is that there is no visible "movement" with regards to the pixels (unlike on the NTSC NES), because a pixel's position relative to the color reference signal does not change from field to field (in  other words, the number of color clocks per field is an integer number).<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">What slider settings would produce a correct image for PAL?</div>Hue = minus 15 degrees.

The NTSC SMB1 avoids scrolling the same number of pixels per field when running fast because that would expose the dot crawl. The PAL SMB1 does scroll the same number of pixels per field when running fast because on PAL, that HIDES the dot crawl.
<br />Basically, the NTSC NES looks clean with still images and dirty during scrolling; the PAL NES is the opposite.
