It's sounding like it all depends on the nsf player you create that will play .nsf files.  From what I gather there is no specific 'nsf mapper'.  To some degree we'd be creating a nsf player that was most easily played on low cost hardware.<br /><br />Perhaps branching off to another topic is in order.  I'd be interested, and I think should be possible with some of the stuff I have right now.  Just need to better understand the 'mapper' and what options we do and don't have without making a ton of work.

The <a href="http://wiki.nesdev.com/w/index.php/NSF" class="postlink">wiki page for NSF</a> outlines the complete NSF mapper, but what we'd need for this project specifically:<br /><br />1. 8 x 4k switchable banks from $8000-FFFF. The banks are addressed by 8 registers accessed at $5FF8-5FFF. It looks like we need to address 1MB worth of ROM (our combined NSF data is ~760k), so they'll need be 8-bit bank select registers. These registers could be moved if necessary, but it'd be easiest if they were at the standard address.<br /><br /><s>2. The NSF spec expects RAM at $6000-7FFF, though I&#39;m not sure if it&#39;s needed for this project. I don&#39;t believe that Famitracker NSFs depend on that RAM, but there are tracks from PPMCK and IT2NSF that I need to investigate a little. I think it&#39;s likely this RAM isn&#39;t needed &#40;will report back later&#41;.</s><br /><br />2. CHR-RAM would probably be the easiest way to do the visual stuff for this, so we wouldn't need any additional hardware logic to swap tiles. You could take your pick w.r.t. mirroring (vertical, horizontal, whatever), it doesn't need to be dynamic.<br /><br />Edit: none of the NSFs require the RAM at $6000-7FFF so that part of the spec can be dropped.<br /><br />Also, is it possible to initialize the top bank register to $FF on reset? I'm not sure if it's feasible to stick a reset stub into every bank of the NSFs.

These registers could be moved if necessary, but it'd be easiest if they were at the standard address.</div><br />Not much issue allowing for this. Only adaptation needed is splitting PRG A12 for 4KB banks.  However moving the banks would be helpful.<br /><br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">NSF&nbsp; &nbsp; Address&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Register<br />====&nbsp; &nbsp;==========&nbsp; &nbsp;========<br />$070&nbsp; &nbsp;$8000-8FFF&nbsp; &nbsp;$5FF8<br />$071&nbsp; &nbsp;$9000-9FFF&nbsp; &nbsp;$5FF9<br />$072&nbsp; &nbsp;$A000-AFFF&nbsp; &nbsp;$5FFA<br />$073&nbsp; &nbsp;$B000-BFFF&nbsp; &nbsp;$5FFB<br />$074&nbsp; &nbsp;$C000-CFFF&nbsp; &nbsp;$5FFC<br />$075&nbsp; &nbsp;$D000-DFFF&nbsp; &nbsp;$5FFD<br />$076&nbsp; &nbsp;$E000-EFFF&nbsp; &nbsp;$5FFE<br />$077&nbsp; &nbsp;$F000-FFFF&nbsp; &nbsp;$5FFF</div><br />I understand these register locations were chosen to not conflict with WRAM and existing sound chip's registers.  But this sucks up too much i/o to stay low cost since it'd require PRG A0-3 as inputs.  PRG A0 might be okay, but A1, A2, and A3 are too costly.  since we already require A12-A14 for decoding I'd suggest something like registers $8000, $9000, $A000 etc.  Basically just line up the reg with the bank it controls.  Could use $5000, $6000, $7000 as well possibly for other functions, or leave as options to de-conflict for other sound extension registers if desired in the future.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">2.

Nice and easy, no changes needed.  8KB CHR-RAM and fix H/V/one-screen mirroring all requires no I/O from the mapper, so that sounds like the best route for this.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">Edit: none of the NSFs require the RAM at $6000-7FFF so that part of the spec can be dropped.<br /><br />Also, is it possible to initialize the top bank register to $FF on reset? I'm not sure if it's feasible to stick a reset stub into every bank of the NSFs.</div><br />It's no problem to initialize any/all of the banks to the last bank at power on.  Reset is a little more tricky/costly since you'd need another i/o to sense reset and possibly some discrete components.  If it helps, since there isn't WRAM, fixing the last 4-8KB of ROM to $6000-7FFF would be pretty easy.  So you'd only need a JMP $6000-7FFF stub in each bank that was ever placed at $F000-FFFF.  You wouldn't need the stub in every bank, just the banks that might be there if the user hit reset.

I'm sure I could manage a stub in every bank that's mapped there. The problem I was concerned about was having to put a stub in all the banks.<br /><br />There's probably no need to map anything to $6000. It might be a convenient place for some player code, but since $8000-BFFF is available to swap some code in anyway, it's not necessary.

I am one of the composers from the soundtrack.  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=":wink:" title="Wink" /> <br /><br />With a couple of exceptions, the majority of the tracks were made in Famitracker. The exceptions are TQ-Jam's (which is done with MML) and my song, which was made with Schism Tracker and then converted to .nsf file via mukunda's it2nsf.<br /><br />The documentation for it2nsf states that the memory mapping to $E000-FFFF must not be changed outside of its music routine. That's the DPCM data access. $A000-CFFF is not used in it2nsf.<br /><br />I don't know what the other ones use for memory mapping, but as long as you don't accidentally switch the banks used for DPCM (I'd think that would be the only place not to touch the bank switches), I think you should be good.
