		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I bought some used 27C256's in a lot on ebay. They had not been blanked. Based on the label and the data on the chip I gather they are pulls from motherboards circa 1990.
<br />
<br />All chips I've purchased previously have arrived blank. If I needed to erase and rewrite one of those, 20 mins in my eraser has done it.
<br />
<br />I did a bunch of these for 20 mins. I read them in the programmer and it came back all FF. The blank check completes ok. They all error out when trying to write new data. I did a second erase on some of them and same story.
<br />
<br />I sent an email to the seller and they said I need to put them in a UV chamber for 24 hours. That sounds like bullshit to me but I thought I would check here first. Is it possible a chip is not erased even if it reads back as blank?

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Old eproms may not be reliable. But I'm heard mixed things. Some people say they are more durable than others. If you can get a manufacturer data sheet you could find their recommended erasing time. Other than that I guess, are the windows nice and clean so all the light is getting through?
<br />
<br />Remember EPROMs aren't digital, there is some kind of analog to digital conversion going on where each memory cell needs a certain level of charge to be a 1 otherwise it is a 0. Or something like that. Incomplete erasing could cause programming and reliability issues I imagine.
<br />
<br />Someone else here probably has a better idea of what you should do.

<br />
<br />Why bother with EPROMs at all, especially given the long wait times for erasing?  Even if you've got, say, 20 of the things you can go through those pretty fast in a quick development/bug testing-fixing cycle.
<br />
<br />So my question is: why not just go with EEPROMs?

<br />
<br />I never used an EPROM in my life, I use only Flash and EEPROMs, which can be erased in seconds.
<br />
<br />I'm not sure what kind of programmable memory would last longer when used in final products though, does anyone have a clue?

<br />
<br />So, approximately, no?
<br />
<br />Other searches imply that older EEPROMs used to be less good at holding their bits (the AMD 28F256 datasheet claims 20 years at 125Â°C)

For something I'm not going to keep permanently, I will put it aside to erase later when I have a few I can do at a time. If ever get around to development, I don't think my turnaround will be fast enough to be programming chips constantly.
<br />
<br />So does anyone think there is any merit to the 24 hour thing? I have the impression that there isn't.

<br />
<br />What is the complete part number of you EPROMs?
<br />What Programmer do you use?
<br />
<br />I suggest you to do this :
<br />
<br />1. Expose EPROM on UV for 30 min
<br />2. Program FF to it at VCC 6~6.5v / VPP 12.5~13v
<br />3. Expose it again for another 30 min
<br />4. Program it with your data VCC 6v / VPP 12.5v
<br />5. Come back here and tell the result
<br />
<br />Go to <a href="http://www.ezoflash.com/chip_database.php" class="postlink">Online memory chip database</a>, search your EPROM and find out correct VCC and VPP for your chip.

<br />
<br />they are M27C256B-15XFI
<br />
<br />I believe this is the corresponding datasheet: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.datasheetcatalog.org/datasheet/stmicroelectronics/2384.pdf">http://www.datasheetcatalog.org/datashe ... s/2384.pdf</a><!-- m -->
<br />
<br />I followed the steps you outlined and am still getting write errors with my real data. I'm using a TOP853 programmer. I don't know how to manually set the program voltage, or if I even can. All the other chips I've done I have picked the generic 27C256-12.7v "template" and it has worked. If I'm reading the datasheet right, 12.7v is a appropriate and erasure time (assuming the correct bulb) is 15-20 minutes. Again, the chips come out of the eraser and will verify as blank, but fail when writing data. 
<br />
<br />I think at this point it's safe to assume the chips are junk, right?
