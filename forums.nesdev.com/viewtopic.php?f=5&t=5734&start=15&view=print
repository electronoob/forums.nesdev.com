<br />But nobody will ever pay that, because they always expect packages to make it no problem.  For a box, priority mail from here to Europe is $13 while Global Express is $59+.  Put that on a website and it will never be chosen.

<br />Sure!  Post the pictures from your Aug 4th email.  Your "retroback4.jpg" photo will show I did not give you an incorrect address.  This is why, on Aug 6th, I asked you why the package was returned, if it made it to the USA, and if you were going to send it again.  Didn't get a response then, and still haven't now.

<br />
<br />It's a such a surprise for me that suddenly you remember something ! All people within this discussion group can see how you consider your customers.
<br />
<br />First, I've never received any answers from you August 6th. If you did that, please send me again this email. Moreover, my email from August 4th was really clear :
<br />" [...] The package that I send you back from France at the address you gave me, has been returned back to me and I paid more 13,15 Euros to keep it back !!!!
<br />PLEASE, send me back my money or give me a REAL address to send you back the product. [...]"
<br />
<br />Do you think that I'm so stupid to pay a third time for your mistakes !
<br />If you had done your job properly I would not be here "moaning and pissing"...as you describe myself on 8bitcollective. 
<br />
<br />You are such a boor ! Your main interest is money !
<br />
<br />Now, find the best solution, and try to be clever for one time, instead asking me paying again and again for your mistakes.

<br /><img src="./images/smilies/icon_eek.gif" alt=":shock:" title="Shocked" />  ! Sorry, but I'm not used to work for US Post Office ! 
<br />On picture "retroback2.jpg" have you noticed in french "RETOUR" that means "RETURN" !!!
<br />
<br /><img src="./images/smilies/icon_eek.gif" alt=":shock:" title="Shocked" />  Is it so hard for you to accept that you have sent the wrong product (see my email from July 21st !!!) : a "Wii RetroPort SNES" instead of  my real and unique order : "1 x NES PowerPak" ! 
<br />
<br />Do you want a picture once again ? It would be fun to see your quality of service...
<br />
<br />Please be honest !!!!!!!
<br />
<br />Send me my order + 13,15 Euros. I will send you back the wrong product ("Wii RetroPort SNES") after receiving my order that I PAID FOR.

<br />Sorry Mottzilla, do you think that i shall solved this issue ? <img src="./images/smilies/icon_idea.gif" alt=":idea:" title="Idea" /> 
<br />
<br />For your information, I have suggested a lot of solution and I've never get a satisfied answer. They ask me to pay again and again....

I do not know your situation exactly but I don't see it being resolved by telling us (people of Nesdev) of the situation and bad mouthing RetroZone and a member of Nesdev. I do hope you can resolve your situation however I don't believe you will if you simply demand something from RetroZone.

<br />
<br />The US Postal Service, as far as I know would normally supply a reason for the return (insufficient postage, invalid address, etc.).  Just don't accuse bunnyboy or anyone of being a thief, when it's 99.9% sure to be an honest mistake originally (yet compounded by an unhelpful, vague note from the post office).  For one person, or a small company, it's a lot of work to design, manufacture, ship, and provide support all at the same time..
<br />
<br />I'm trying to help you out here, but my advise would be to visit your post office in person, have them ship it for you (so you know all the export paperwork is there and right procedures are followed).  If you don't get a refund for your shipping then, then you've got a very valid complaint.  I'm just pointing out that it's a rare and exceptional company that will ship a product without receiving a return first. 
<br />
<br />Mistakes happen, and that's a really crummy situation, especially considering that the postage costs are surely exceeding the value of the wrong product you received.  I'm assuming Retrozone wants it back.

<br />You are free to say what you want.
<br />I'm just telling what happen to me and just warn people that this person is not honest. 
<br />If you want to find excuse for this person and to be on his side, it's your choice. But it's the wrong side !
<br />
<br />In my country and as far as I know, in the USA, thieves are punished ! My only defense is to denounce the facts and hope that there will be no more victims.
