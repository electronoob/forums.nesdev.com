		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I have posted that on 2A03.org 2 years ago <a href="http://2a03.org/forum/viewtopic.php?id=924" class="postlink">http://2a03.org/forum/viewtopic.php?id=924</a>. (all the data in the period column is from blargg APU reference, so I assume it's accurate <img src="./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" /> ) It shows the same info like in any docs that talks about DPCM, but I've added one crucial info: the obvious detuning of some speeds.
<br />
<br />But recently I thought, "Well, it's surely all detuned, but those freqs are high and it's nearly impossible with a "timer" system to stay in tune in high freqs. Are those speeds the closest possible to tuned note frequencies?"
<br />
<br />I took my Voyage200 and divided the 2A03 master clock (1.7897725MHz) by all the frequencies of the tuned notes, rounded it to the closest integer (so I get a value of what I'm supposed to put in the internal DPCM period register to be at the closest possible frequency) and I compared the result with the period of each speed.
<br />
<br />The error is within -1 to 1, half of the time being 0.
<br />
<br />Bananmos were not sure if "Nintendo designed certain values to be notes, or if it's just blind luck that they are". Well, there's strong evidence here that those periods were chosen according to how close it gets to some note's frequencies.
<br />
<br />P.S.: If you really want to see all my calculations, I can post them on demand.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />So if I read this correctly, it seems that they did try to get every DPCM value to be as close to the corresponding pitches as possible?
<br />
<br />Pretty cool. But that kind of makes me wonder why Nintendo never bothered making use of that. There were zero first party games that used DPCM for melodic parts, correct? I know there were issues of cost, space, and efficiency regarding samples, but it seems a bit funny that they'd let some 3rd party companies essentially figure it out on their own (as I would assume), and do nothing with it themselves.
<br />
<br />Also, thanks again for making that table. I've made use of it.  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />

<br />
<br />Anyway altough I like music in Sunsoft games, the DPCM bass often sounds detuned and "windy". If only Nintendo would have provided us another sample encoding instead...

<br />pff you can do that forever though, if only nintendo had given us 3 squares instead of two, or if only the triangle had volume

<br />I think you don't have to worry about that part. I think it's every day and kept for 30 days.  Koitsu is doing a good job about it. And if you're that worry, I'm sure he could give us a backup anytime if that was the case but I'm not that worried compared to the last wiki server <img src="./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" /> Parodius do their job well, period.

<br />
<br />That's a good question, I never checked the size. BUT for people that want a local copy, if you were not aware,  there exist a local html version of the wiki <a href="http://wiki.nesdev.com/wikiDump/NESdevWiki_20100221.7z" class="postlink">here</a>. It's the same thing as the wiki except static. I use a plug-in to extract the content.  I update it once in a while. I thought it was a nice thing to have for people that sometime don't have access to the net but still want to see the wiki content.  It can serve as a somewhat "poor man backup" if something goes very wrong: as long as you update the local version often.
<br />
<br />There a way to ask the wiki for an xml version of the complete wiki that you can import in yours so there is always a way to get the content without having access to the DB. I was not aware of that when I moved the content... I would have saved time.
