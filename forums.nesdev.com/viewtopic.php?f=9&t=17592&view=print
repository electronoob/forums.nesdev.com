		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I purchased an original Famicom from japan (ebay) two weeks ago.<br />Today I received the package and connected it to my tube tv.<br />As I currently live in europe and original power brick is AC100v input, I plugged it in with my Super Nintendo power brick which has similar specs (9-9.4v output) but it didnt work.<br />I decided to use my Sega Genesis 1 power brick, which has the same output as the original one (10v)<br />The console worked fine, as I was testing several cartridges, until after 5-10 min I turned it off, changed game and turned on, to get a black screen. Then the previously tested (working) games also gave me the black screen.<br /><br />The tv seems to react when I turn the power on, the black screen moves a bit.<br /><br />I don't know if i messed it up when i connected the SNES power brick, as the plug might be different than the original one... But in this case, shouldn't it have stopped working right away?<br /><br />Anyway, if you have any suggestions on how to proceed into this please enlighten me.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I'm at work right now, so I can't check my notes, but IIRC the PAL SNES power plug is 5.5 OD x 2.5 ID. The Famicom and model 1 Genesis are both 5.5 OD x 2.1 OD. So the PAL SNES power plug would have just been a loose fit, but shouldn't have damaged anything.<br /><br />My guess would be dirty cart slot and dirty carts, which can cause it to sporadically work and not work. I suggest cleaning the cart slot and the cart contacts really well.

I'm suprised it even worked after you tried the snes power plug.<br /><br />edit: Forgot to give more advice. Things you can check: check if you're getting 5V out of the 7805 regulator, the pinout can be found on google. If not, replace it.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />If I remember correctly, the Famicom has a 1.5A picofuse that is often the source of this type of problem. I've seen it blown a few times when people bring theirs to me for repair; use a cheap multimeter in to check for continuity. It's the same fuse as in a SNES and they're easy to find online.

First I did a good cleanup of the cart slot and still didn't work.<br /><br />Now, as I've checked some videos on the internet and seen the famicom board, I noticed that the circuit for the power management is different than the ones I've seen, so I think this might have been replaced.

Any ideas where that could be here? I might not be seeing it.<br /><br />Now, I tested the 7805. Plugged in my sega mega drive power brick and tested the output. It is around 12 volts.<br /><br /><img src="https://i.imgur.com/hKeCYiPl.jpg" alt="Image" /><br />original size: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://i.imgur.com/hKeCYiP.jpg">https://i.imgur.com/hKeCYiP.jpg</a><!-- m --><br /><br />Excuse me for my ignorance, but I also tested the power brick and the output is around 13 volts. Is this normal? Pictures of the tests:<br /><br /><img src="https://i.imgur.com/USm4hjZl.jpg" alt="Image" /><br />original size: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://i.imgur.com/USm4hjZ.jpg">https://i.imgur.com/USm4hjZ.jpg</a><!-- m --><br /><br /><img src="https://i.imgur.com/hCdLI3Dl.jpg" alt="Image" /><br />original size: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://i.imgur.com/hCdLI3D.jpg">https://i.imgur.com/hCdLI3D.jpg</a><!-- m --><br /><br />In the case this is a replacement circuit without a fuse, (excuse me again for my ignorance) is there a possibility that I have fried other parts of the circuit with the AC? and with 12 volts?<br /><br />I will go ahead and try replacing the 7805 next week I guess.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />There is no fuse on the famicom, only super famicom.<br /><br />Are you sure you're measuring the output of the 7805? If it's outputting 12V it's very likely other parts of the circuit are damaged. But I think you might be measuring the input.<br /><br />As far as the power brick outputting 13V, this is normal, power bricks based on transformers tend to not be very exact, and also will vary depending on the load.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Some Famicom revisions absolutely have a 1.5A picofuse but not in your motherboard revision (yours is an older one, and the daughterboard is original), so there's one less thing to check. The best way to troubleshoot is to follow where the flow of power should be from component to component, and figure out where it stops. If everything seems okay, your problem is elsewhere.

I never got any audio output after the &quot;incident&quot;.<br /><br />I ordered some new 7805s and going to give it a try when they arrive. Let's cross fingers that it's only that.

If it's too hot it's probably fried.<br />But this test is just useless if there's no current arriving at the mainboard.<br />You can also try to do the diode test on the IC's terminals as described <a href="https://forums.nesdev.com/viewtopic.php?f=9&amp;t=16305&amp;p=203042&amp;hilit=diode+test#p201677" class="postlink">here.</a><br /><br />To do a better test you could find another Famicom/NES/Famiclone, socket its ICs and test the suspicious component on it.<br />Hope you can fix it!
