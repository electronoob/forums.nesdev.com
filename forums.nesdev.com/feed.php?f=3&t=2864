I guess this depends on what you mean by "fetched".<br /><br />The low two bits are the only <em>relevent</em> bits to determine opacity/transparency.  Though attribute bits have already been fetched quite some time before this comparison takes place, as I understand it.  BG Attributes were fetched with the NT byte and are probably residing in some temporary register somewhere (perhaps another shift register?), and sprite attributes are in the secondary OAM... or even in a temp reg, since they might be needed for this comparison anyway (to know if the sprite pixel has foreground priority, or is horizontally flipped?)<br /><br /><br />But again -- more speculation on my part.  You seem to be focusing more on how the hardware works than I ever did.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=33">Disch</a> — Wed Jan 17, 2007 12:11 pm</p><hr />

I would think it would have to be on whatever cycle leaves the top 8 bits "empty" and the previously loaded tile in the low 8 bits.  So either cycle 7 after the shift regs are shifted -- or cycle 0 before they're shifted?<br /><br />If I had to guess -- I'd say cycle 7.  Then again that doc says "at the start" -- so maybe it's cycle 0.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=33">Disch</a> — Mon Jan 15, 2007 11:59 am</p><hr />
