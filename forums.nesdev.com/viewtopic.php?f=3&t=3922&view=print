		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />having a problem with Castlevania2, i start the game and walk down the stairs and there are frame glitches were the starting ppu address is 0 randomly.   i have traced the ppu address and it increments except for the few glitches were it starts a 0.
<br />
<br />i have checked nmi's and those are every frame, nothing that looks wrong.
<br />
<br />i think i might have the ppu address and ppu address latch wrong.  usually the code before every frame while in the town is writing to the ppu and setting the ppu address.  on the frames with glitches it does nothing, yet the nmi occurs.  its like it decided there is nothing to update and waites another frame. 
<br />
<br />so i am thinking either something is wrong and the nmi code should always update something and its not.
<br />
<br />or i am not handling the ppu address and ppu address latch correctly.   like the nmi code infact has nothing to update, and it expects the last ppu address ( or latch) to be correct (or the same as the last frame).   should the ppu address latch be the same each frame if cpu never writes to a ppu register ?
<br />
<br />i would also like to suggest a test if someone has the time or interest.  test the ppu address for incrementing while writing to the registers, and while the ppu is rendering.  are the same latches used for the registers as while rendering.  (hope i explained that well)  i have one ppu address and one ppu address latch that is used by both teh registers and the ppu
<br />
<br />thanks
<br />
<br />matt

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" /><div class="quotetitle">mattmatteh wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">should the ppu address latch be the same each frame if cpu never writes to a ppu register ?</div><br /><br />Yes.  Nothing ever changes the latch except for $2000, $2005, and $2006 writes.  So if the game doesn't write to any of those regs, the latch never changes.<br /><br />The latch is copied to the actual PPU address every frame (provided rendering is switched on) on the pre-render scanline before any pixels are drawn.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">are the same latches used for the registers as while rendering.</div>
<br />
<br />Yes.
<br />
<br />The PPU has two 15-bit addresses.  The temp address (latch), and the actual address.  The actual address is the only one actually used directly by the PPU (ie:  it is the one incremented after every tile fetch, after every $2007 read/write, etc, etc).
<br />
<br />The latch is only used to refill the actual address at key times in the frame.
