I'm also having trouble accessing the saves for StarTropics 1 and 2 and wondering if anyone figured out how to write to them. I tried tinkering with Anago's mmc3.ag script to read the MMC6 PRG RAM and the best I could do was to dump a bunch of junk and delete my cartridge saves. If anyone can figure out how to make Anago work with these two games I'd be grateful.<br /><br />TC: I was able to read and write my Shadowgate save, so I guess it's an issue with the individual cartridge. Maybe cleaning your cartridge would get it to work.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=6725">bretts87</a> — Mon Oct 13, 2014 9:59 am</p><hr />

Hello,<br /><br />Recently I purchased the Kazzo INL Retro Dumper-Programmer from InfiniteNESLives, with the intention of dumping the SRAM of all my old actual NES carts.  These were the games I grew up with, and <em>most</em> of them have still retained their save data all these years, and I just wanted to be able to back them up while I still could, before that part of my childhood was lost forever.<br /><br />Using the guide I found in <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/viewtopic.php?uid=6258&amp;f=9&amp;t=10788&amp;start=0" class="postlink">this thread</a>, I was successfully able to dump the SRAM of most of my games.  (Thank you so much!! <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" />)  However, there were a few couple ones I just could not get to work, at all: Shadowgate and StarTropics.  (Also, I haven't tried StarTropics 2, but for reasons I will explain in just a second, I am reasonably sure it will end up having the same problem.)  I stopped to do some research, and that was when I noticed the link between the working versus non-working ones was in the mappers: Dragon Warrior, NES Open, all the games that actually worked use the MMC1 mapper according to <a href="http://tuxnes.sourceforge.net/nesmapper.txt" class="postlink">this list</a>.  Shadowgate and StarTropics (and StarTropics 2) use MMC3.<br /><br />Ah, so I just run it using mmc3.ag instead of mmc1_sxrom.ag and that will fix it, right?<br /><br />Wrong.  Those games <em>still</em> won't work, even with the proper script, and that's where I'm stumped.  It acts like it's working, it goes through the motions and spits out a .sav file and everything, but that .sav file is basically blank and useless--putting it in with the other .sav files and testing with a ROM changes nothing; it acts like a completely new game with no save data whatsoever.  The .sav file is right there, but it may as well not be.  I assume that means the .sav file is no good, which means something in the dumping process didn't work.  And yes, I have confirmed that the save data still exists and is valid on the actual cart in an actual NES.<br /><br />So, now I turn to you.  Is there some sort of trick I'm missing to get the .sav files from transfer over properly?  You <em>can</em> dump the SRAM data of MMC3 games with an INL Kazzo dumper, right?<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=6696">kjorteo</a> — Sun Sep 21, 2014 5:26 pm</p><hr />
