The other palettes used for backdrop and the placeholder status bar don't do much here and could easily be used for other stuff. <br /><br />It started out as an investigation on how diablo might look like if it were to be demade, but it quickly evolved into something else (but a bit similar looking). I made a bunch of notes too on how this may actually play if anyone's interested, but i'd like to hear what you think of it first.

How many tiles in that screen?<br /><br />If I had to nitpick, it's a little monochromatic. But attribute boundaries are pretty limiting for unaligned graphics.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Thanks! I counted to 143 or $8f unique tiles in use. Some could possibly be replaced by lookalikes.<br /><br /><br />Regarding monochromatism, i want to do something about it, but first i wanted to be sure i could do something that looks convincing with just one. Changing the common colour from black to middle blue should open up some possibilities, but generally speaking/in many cases, two colours need to be common for a transparent effect. Other than that, i guess a game engine could alternate between attribute tables to increase the granularity but i don't know if that is practical or feasible.<br /><br />Another note on the same is that it probably shows of that i'm much more used to scribbling with black on white than with colour pencils.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />2 player co-op is the aim! I'd like to have players choose from four characters (much like Gauntlet which is a prime reference), and one of the characters would be a thief boy named Wart, in reference to *some* character in Diablo 1. Haven't thought much about their looks yet, though.<br /><br />EDIT: Will and Faith was actually just attributes, but i think they are perfect as character flavour. Mind if i use it as such?

You could make the edge of the building appear more roughed up to work better with BG attributes.

I'd also try and go for more varied colors still, which would make you need to fix the bottom part with the dirt of it'd look really messed up. I actually notice that you're using a gold and a gray palette, which could be a bit of a problem.

This would also be the most likely thing to cause trouble with color clash. Would be worth trying to figure out though.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />that black mass (mess?) was me throwing something cheapo there made from recycled cloud and mountain tiles before dinner just to have something that could serve as separation. It's replaced with dedicated ruin/cliffside tiles now, in the same post. <br /><br />@M_tee: Thanks! I like your style, it is very clear. That's something i can take lessons from.  <img src="./images/smilies/Mfr_icon_homebrew.png" alt=":beer:" title="Beer" /><br /><br />@sik: food for thought. It could be easier to implement in the dungeons where no palette is bound to the lake/ocean.

Anyway, One thing I did do is I made the sunset a bit taller changed the color of the clouds, because I don't know why they'd be blue in this case. I actually tried to make the ocean less blue and more of that golden color, but I couldn't get it to work. I'm not to sure what's up with your ocean, as it goes from dark, to  light, to medium, and then to dark again. I'd have thought it'd be a steady gradient from dark on the bottom to light on the top.<br /><br />And yeah, the wall is 16 pixels taller.<br /><br /><div class="attachtitle">Attachment:</div><div class="attachcontent">
