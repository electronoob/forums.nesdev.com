<br />If you want to, I need some help on turning this routine to handle rendering for Horizontal mirroring or One screen mirroring

<br />
<br />I wanted to switch to MMC5 mapper for enhanced 8x8 color rendering. But this enhancement only applies to One Screen Mirroring.
<br />
<br />There is also some mappers that only handle Onescreen mirroring that I wanted to try it out with.

<br />But you DO need to keep the ExAttributes updated and limit them to just what's on screen.  But that's something you'd have to code from scratch anyway.
<br />
<br />So yeah -- you don't need to mess with this part of the drawing routine or change the mirroring mode or whatever.
<br />
<br />EDIT
<br />
<br />I guess you do need to do all this work if you want to switch to 1-screen.  But why would you want to do that?  Only mapper I can think of that is worth considering which only does 1-screen is mapper 7, but what good would mapper 7 do you for SMB?

<br />
<br />I really originally needed to hack it to use Horizontal mirroring. So I can not use Four-screen mirroring all the time, And also to to improve the game a little, I guess the only solution is Four-screen I guess.
<br />
<br />If SMB3 ever gets disassembled (according to doppleganger at RHDN) Then things get better than this.

<br />
<br />First of all, My hacks originally used Four-screen, Then I wanted to make some hack to make the renderer use One/Horizontal Mirroring, Then I hit a problem. So I now must do the original plan instead of that.
<br />
<br />Does that make sense now?

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />(Bump) I have found a few ideas on how to do this:
<br />
<br />1. Make my own render routine. (Not that possible right now unless I learn more about Metatile Rendering ASM basics), 
<br />
<br />2. Make my own map/attribute/metatile editor with a NEW Map system (Not very easy to implent)
<br />
<br />3. Get a Team or someone to help out a little, as in the recent RHDN/(Acmlm)Board2 teams. (Attempted, but not that possible to me)
<br />
<br />OR
<br />
<br />4. Do not bother with it at all (VERY likely)
<br />
<br />For right now, Number 4 is the best choice unless I do and learn more of 6502 ASM, Which is the only syntax I know (although not very much) about ASM. 
<br />
<br />Until then, I should wait until Tepples SMB1 clone ''President'' is done.
