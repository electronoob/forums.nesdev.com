This might be more involved, as the emulator probably doesn't support <em>two</em> mappers active simultaneously.<br /><br />But given that at least two emulators already support it, why not just use one of them?</div><br /><br /><br />i like the first method blargg and thank you for posting this response a while back ago, i was just reading through this thread again, and i did some digging around and i see fceultra has you rename the game genie rom to gg.rom and place it in the directory for fce to run it but since i work with nestopia source i am thinking of ways to do this for nestopia.<br /><br />So im thinking about something like this also, have the emulator look for &quot;gg.rom&quot; in the bios folder, the same place you would place the disksys.rom for fds, you would have an option in the UI that allows you to &quot;turn off and on&quot; the game genie bios so if you just want to play a rom without the gg screen popping up first you just turn it to off and the rom would load normally.

Check out genie.c to see how it handles detecting which codes have been entered after the user presses the start button. Then it simply remembers the codes, and continues to load the game ROM and starts playing. It's actually pretty simple to do. Also check the read6502 function in NES.c to see how it actually implements the codes to modify the game.

Take for instance megaman 2, when using the game genie code for inifinite energy, the music is messed up, however on nestopia when using this code, the music plays normal. <br /><br />Can anyone shed any light as to why this might be happening?

Just the title/losing race song uses 7FB for the sweep registers.
