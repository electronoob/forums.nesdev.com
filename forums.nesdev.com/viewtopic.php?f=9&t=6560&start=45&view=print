		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Except for experts, it's probably easiest to buy a PCB and populate it. It depends on which mapper your game uses. NROM (0), CNROM (3), UNROM (2, 180), BNROM (34), and AOROM (7) can be reproduced with the ReproPak board, an EEPROM for PRG, an EEPROM or SRAM for CHR, a couple 7400 series ICs, and a CIClone. MMC1 (1) can be reproduced with the ReproPak MMC1 board, an EEPROM for PRG, an EEPROM or SRAM for CHR, and a CIClone.<br /><br />If you really feel like designing your own PCB, the key dimensions are 2.50 mm from the center of one pin to the next (not the more common 2.54 mm) and 1.2 mm thickness.

How did Farid printed his own PCB design anyway?<br /><br />I wish that an easier UNROM solution existed apart from the Repropak... I'm programming a homebrew which I want to see released on small quantities, but the price + taxes for 20 Repropaks + Ciclones + Shells, plus transportation costs and taxes make that solution inviable... there are some brazilian members here in this forum, they know what I'm talking about.<br />Another option is to buy a lot of silent service carts, but I would prefer new boards, and it is hard to find carts in good condition (in larger quantities).<br /><br />If you know about another easy solution for new UNROM PCB carts please tell me!

And depending on the price, I would even contact some national companies about it, but there is another problem: the shells, and I did a more &quot;deep&quot; research on the subject, even the cheaper aluminium molds are dead expensive... better use donors anyway. <br /><br />The reason I wanted to use new PCBs was because of the 3 wires and pin bending that needs to be done, I wanted to make it look more professional (even being a very small print run), since I'm looking to sell it. Oh well, I hope no one opens the cart's shells <img src="./images/smilies/icon_lol.gif" alt=":lol:" title="Laughing" />

The NES makes it a little more difficult due to the 72 pin connector.  This really isn't a good option for a small production. <br /><br /><a href="http://imall.iteadstudio.com/open-pcb/pcb-prototyping.html" class="postlink">itead</a> is the best solution I've found to getting smaller quantities with the proper thickness.  You can get 10 10x5cm boards for around $22 plus shipping.<br /><br />There are open source CIC solutions out there now, so that can save you around $3 compared to the CIClone.  You still have to get a case though.  So if you do it right you could still use all new parts for under $10 each plus memory/mapper.

You can source the needed chemicals, boards, and paper pretty cheaply elsewhere if you're really trying to cut cost.  Not to mention corrosion is going to be a pain with self etched NES boards.  I'd consider it for a one off, but not production.
