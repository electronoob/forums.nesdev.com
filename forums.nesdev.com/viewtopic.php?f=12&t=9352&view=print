		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I apologize if this has already been covered elsewhere, but when I searched for this I couldn't find information on it anywhere. Now at one point in my life I was a hardware electronics engineer so when I read about the difference between lorom and hirom games I suspected that the difference's on the PCB's were only at the wiring on the mad-1 chip. Upon closer inspection of two of my games, Chrono Trigger, a hirom game, and NBA live 96, a lorom game, I found that the only differences with the PCB was indeed some of the routing of the mad-1.<br /><br /><br />My beloved Chrono Trigger PCB is below:<br /><br /><a href="http://imageshack.us/photo/my-images/209/chrontriggercloseup.jpg/" class="postlink"><img src="http://imageshack.us/a/img209/7508/chrontriggercloseup.th.jpg" alt="Image" /></a><br /><br /><br />Now below is the PCB of NBA Live 96:<br /><br /><a href="http://imageshack.us/photo/my-images/26/nbalivecloseup.jpg/" class="postlink"><img src="http://imageshack.us/a/img26/8084/nbalivecloseup.th.jpg" alt="Image" /></a><br /><br /><br />After a quick overview in Photoshop I'm willing to bet that a quick rewire of these 4 pin assignments would allow me to install a hirom game image on this lorom cart. My question is has anyone tried this before, and if so were they successful?

I'm planning the following to convert the PCB over:<br /><br />I'm planning to rewire the assignments on the top of the pcb at the mad1's IC's legs as much as possible using the following four steps: <br />1) Navy blue pin to red pin assignment<br />2) Purple pin to to light blue(1) cut bottom trace leading to lower via<br />3) Red pin assignment to purple<br />4) light blue pin wire soldered to lower light blue(2) via only &lt;-- possibly on the top of the pcb once I've removed the original mask rom for easy access<br /><br />Anyone have any better more efficient wiring ideas?

Edited the photos for you :p I forget that not everyone has a super hi res screen all the time. Your link is promising in that it seems to be possible, but I have no rom replacements to test out my theory. I'm thinking of ordering from buyicnow.com, but I have a few concerns.<br /><br />1) when you buy a tsop flash with adapter is everything soldered together for you as a drop in replacement?<br />2) I'm concerned about the longevity of the tsop flash retaining data. Does anyone have any idea? <br />3)Does anyone have any links for prepping the rom image for programming? I know you need to remove the header and I've used purify with bsnes to do so, but I want buyic to program the chip for me, and I'm not very familiar with the process at all.<br /><br />Thanks!!!

Pre-soldered TSOP from buyitnow are drop in replacement for 36 pin MASKROM. As for the longevity, I wouldn't worry about this, I've seem eprom from the 80's still working so I do not worry much about flash memory. As for prepping image, snespurify from bsnes should be all you need.

Hopefully in a few weeks I'll be able to report back that it was all successful. I do have a hirom madden 94 cart were I could solder off the maskrom and pop it in to the converted NBA live 96 pcb. Unfortunately madden 94 has no sram, battery or mad1 chip so I don't know if this will even work. Do you think it's worth a shot?

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />If the game didn't need SRAM, it probably won't hurt if it is on a board that has it. It's only when it needs it and doesn't have it that it is a problem. So you should be able to put the maskrom in the board that has the sram + battery. You're just wanting to test out if your LoROM/HiROM conversion works right? So borrowing the MaskROM should work.
