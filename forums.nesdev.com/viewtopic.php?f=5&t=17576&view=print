There has already been discussion over &quot;what are the rules now that we're not on Parodius Networking&quot;, and as such, reminding folks of at least a base rule (esp. considering Nintendo's recent actions) would seem wise.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Yup, I'm concerned about the same thing.  The NSF aspect may actually warrant the need to discuss with an actual IP/DMCA attorney.  Tricky subject, I think, considering they're &quot;partial&quot; extractions (certainly containing original playerback code, sequenced data, and (if applicable) PCM samples)... but they're not &quot;an entire ROM&quot; in the literal sense.<br /><br />Bare minimum: Nintendo seems to be going after stuff they themselves produced, so NSFs of official Nintendo titles might be worth pulling, if there are any.

It's been really weird to me that IP owners <em>don't</em> seem to police NSFs, VGM rips, etc. but as someone who enjoys and benefits from their presence I'm glad it's been this way.

If you talks about sharing a &quot;rom&quot; and mp3 or avi/mp4 (etc) then it will surely gets theirs attention but nsf/vgm?  Not many people would know about that.<br /><br />But yes, now that Nintendo (America branch only?) seems sensitive, this is worrisome, a little bit. Up to know I'm not aware of them sending legal actions for nsf files but hmmm...<br /><br />Man I hate those things.  It's not like distributing a game or something, you just want to listen to some game music.

So if we see the company publishing its back catalog's soundtracks <em>en masse</em> on Amazon Music, iTunes Store/Apple Music, and Google Play Music, then we get worried.

Somebody else that's into ROM preservation can tackle that. My understanding is that here we stay legal by avoiding it entirely.
