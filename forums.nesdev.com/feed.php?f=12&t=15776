UPX is a nightmare, and never worth it. I fought false positives for a few years but eventually threw in the towel and just rely on the 7zip archive for compression during distribution. It's not UPX' fault, but it's a battle you cannot win, much like screensaver suppression and joypad input.<br /><br />AV software is worse than having most real viruses.<br /><br />Also, even without UPX, I'm pretty sure Martin employs other tricks to try to protect his binaries from modifications, like a CRC check on the uncompressed binary. Could be mistaken, but I know there was <em>one</em> closed source emudev that loved doing that.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"><br />(Don't be surprised if I make a post soon ranting about how closed-sourcedness is of the devil. It's why I gave up on the SNES and frankly, if you are a software developer who won't share things because you want your name plastered on them or you think it's okay to just release a program on Windows and make everyone else use Wine, I don't like you.)<br /></div><br /><br />I like you :)<br /><br />The thing that pushed me toward the GPL instead of the ISC license was actually FuSoYa's Snes9X SuperFX tracer. He botched a detail (turned out to be ROMB reads) in a way that broke Doom exactly like I had in my early SuperFX support. Had he released the source, it would've been a five minute fix to see what he changed from the mainline Snes9X and to fix that bug in my core.<br /><br />But because he was too selfish to share a few fprintf commands after taking the entirety of Snes9X's source for himself (his site had a screed about -not- asking him for source, too, or I'd have tried that), I had to spend a few days trying to figure out the bug with no help at all.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=375">byuu</a> — Tue Apr 11, 2017 7:00 am</p><hr />

ZSNES is the most ancient of emulators, it is written in i386, its job was to run a SNES on a 486DX66. I use to run it on my P133 and it still had some issues, My VESA driver ( stupid S3 piece of crap) couldn't do 16bit so no transparency effects for me. I had to play Chrono Trigger with the 3rd layer disabled so I could see in some levels. I'm from Oz so no real cart for me.. It has not been updated in 10 years ( I was going to say 20, but the sneaked one out in 2007 ). It prays heavily at the alter of speed, not accuracy, a lot of the old SNES patches and home brew don't work on the newer emulators or even hardware as they are ZSNES compatible only. However I would think for your needs it should be sufficient, you might need to do a debug session on something newer at the end, but for the most part ZSNES should get you through the ZSKnight <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" /><p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=8250">Oziphantom</a> — Mon Apr 10, 2017 10:47 pm</p><hr />

My point was more do you need  a full emulator or can you use just a SPC emulator? as just emulating the SPC would help with performance on an Atom. But if you want need the SNES CPU to interact for you needs then not enough. For you more debugging based needs and Linux? based usage this would probably suit better <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://vspcplay.raphnet.net/">http://vspcplay.raphnet.net/</a><!-- m --> than same SPCamp(which I feel is the most famous of SPC players ) and being open source you could tack a debugger and code stepper in as well with probably little effort. <br /><br />Its not, but always an option.

The C64, NES sure we tend to be very code driven and there is the one way and one mode for everything. For the SNES however we don't really need a map editor but more a Game editor, something that lets up map our blocks, be it a 2x2 grid, or a 4x4 or a group of banana's in a long trail. Then you probably want to be able to turn screens into blocks so we can repeat large parts of the map but with different control characters or pallets. Of which the how, what, when and why is going to depend on the exact type and style of game we are making. <br /><br />I feel a better approach would be a &quot;standard&quot; library, a &quot;SNES.cs&quot; file( well collection ) that has code to draw SNES tile data to a Panel object at a given X,Y with pallete Z. A standard Pallet RGB entry system that handles the Scaling and renders a picker for the colours. A RAW 16 colour and 256 bitmap conversion function down to SNES bpp formats, that converts either the whole things or a sub window. So we can make our tools take png, or jpeg or tga or ilbm and convert as we please. A function that takes a 2D array and spits out the data into the standard SNES DMA offset formats. A colour window/enable window rendering system,that understand a HDMA chain or will convert a 1bit bitmap to a HDMA chain. Trying to make the perfect tool will never work, but making it faster to throw together an editor would help all of us.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=8250">Oziphantom</a> — Mon Apr 10, 2017 1:04 am</p><hr />
