Just my $0.02 about this thing... *ahem*<br /><br />It <em>seems</em> Q was requesting some admin action regarding this forum, of being overloaded by "dummies" or "spammers" registering like crazy. Well, I have/had the same issue in my forum, though I delete those ones and ban their IPs/e-mails when possible. Plus, the same <em>man</em> that manages the IRC channel, regarding the ban list, from what I read the text... Since it took zero effect, he "vanished".<br /><br />Be clear: my <em>speculation</em> after reading the IRC logs... ^ ^ and I'd like to make clean my respect by everyone.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=39">Zepper</a> — Tue Feb 06, 2007 2:13 pm</p><hr />

Q is just acting too japanese, he remebers me those who always are the hero's closest friend in Mangas who always make a supid and irrelevant mistake, then pass in a depressing phase such as "My honour is spoiled. I was unable to complete my destiny. I'm not dign to be your friend. I'm gonna sucid myself. Go alone, [...].".<br /><br />And later, they of course always think again, change their mind and eventually come back to hero's side for the rest of the adventure. I hope Quietust will follow that path too.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=38">Bregalad</a> — Tue Feb 06, 2007 1:29 pm</p><hr />

There's something that I call "tailgating" when someone is angry or otherwise not acting "normally".

A reaction is always to the sum total of a person's experiences up to that point, but others only see the immediate <em>catalyst</em>, and often dismiss what happens next. Sure, it might be spilled milk, but the angry outburst is not merely about spilled milk.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=17">blargg</a> — Tue Feb 06, 2007 12:13 pm</p><hr />
