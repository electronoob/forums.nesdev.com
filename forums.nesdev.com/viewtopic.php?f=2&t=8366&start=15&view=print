<br />Not to discourage innovation, but I agree with this. I think there are some more worthwhile things that can be done for the NES.

<br />
<br />For example in a RPG with all 16x16 sprites, you could use this trick on the hero, it's arguable the look of the hero is more important than the look of other stuff so you want him to have one more color while still having a black outline.
<br />If you scroll only in one direction at a time, you just have to reserve a total of 6 tiles for this and dynamically upload them every frame when the player is moving, which is doable with some unrolled loop. You'll also have to upload four nametable bytes every 8 pixels of scrolling (in addition to the normal updates).
<br />So yes this is quite a few updates, but you can use one more color on the hero while still having 3 NPCs on the same line without flickering, while using a 2-layered hero would only allow 2 NPCs on the line, 3 will flicker. Also you'd have to store both layers in CHR RAM while here you only reserve 6 background tiles for that effect.
<br />
<br />In games with bigger sprites which does multi directional scrolling, it's probably not worth the trouble as it would require way too much updates on both name tables and pattern tables for only one more color while multilayering allows 2/3 more colors (typically 2 as you'd have a black color common in all palettes for outlines - but not compularly).
<br />
<br />So this sounds like a decent idea for RPGs.

<br />
<br />In a RPG you'd need 6 tiles instead of just one for the trick, and you'd have to store multiple animation frames of mask corresponding to different metasprites.
<br />I guess I'll have to write a proof of concept ROM that demonstrate this feature.

<br />Yeah, I remember seeing this in Marble Madness, one of the BG tiles has a single pixel that will slide up and down along with the scrolling.

<br />
<br />However it ended up a bit more complicated than I expected to generate the nametable updates. I now did a program that follows the player by animating NT and PT updates, so all's left is programming the dynamic "AND" mask. Unfortunately I have a lot of work in real life so I'm not sure if I'll be able to end this demo before Christmas, but I'll try my best.

<br />There is currently no collision detection on purpose to show the effect on different kind of tiles.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Nice demo! It's quite a good example of where this technique could be useful in software. Although Jut Breed did manage to have colorful characters even without it, if you disregard all the reddish enemies :)
<br />
<br />Another type of AND mask that comes to mind is to support sprites being partially by BG without requiring a one color background such as is the case for sprite priority. This is sort of the opposite of the technique discussed in this thread, as you modify the sprite CHR based on the BG it intersects. 
<br />
<br />Solstice is a nice example of doing this trick in software. But the fact that it runs in a small part of the screen with the rest of the screen blanked may be related to all the CHR-RAM updates it needs to do to pull this off...

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />The Mega Man series and Super Mario Bros. 2 USA (for Mario and Princess) used a sprite overlay trick to create characters of more than 3 colors.
<br />In case of Mega Man, the face is a distinct white-yellow sprite that is overlayed on the blue-cyan-black body, and in case of Mario and Princess, the eyes were overlayed over the character's non-hollow face. (Why they did not use it for Luigi and Toad, I don't know.)

<br />Yeah. This can also be done by using a higher priority sprite with the "behind BG" flag set and having the shape you want to give to the BG. Castlevania uses this for the door entrance, SMB3 uses it for pipes (instead of simply making Mario "behind BG" like SMB1 does).
<br />
<br />This priority could also be done in my demo by placing the hero's sprite "behind BG", which would have no effect as the BG is transparent where the sprite is, but then alter the logic so that the player shadow is NOT masked where you want the player to be masked. The player would still be visible through the BG color as he's literally "behind BG".
<br />
<br />Of course it would require adding some more complex logic where it's already quite complex.
<br />If you simply want to hide the player behind some tiles and not some others though it's as simple as not uploading the name table with the special tiles, but you're limited to square tile-aligned shapes.
