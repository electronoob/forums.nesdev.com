<br />- Write a dummy nonzero value to $400b (such as #$07), the real $400a value and the real $400b value
<br />- Write in the order $400a, $400b when the period goes upward, and the order $400b, $400a when it goes downward. Sounds a bit more difficult to implement, as you'd have to compare new and old values or something in the like.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Well I guess the test program I did isn't the best implementation of how to write the two period registers.
<br />
<br />In my actual audio engine it's just a pair of lda/sta instructions;
<br />
<br />lda periodLo
<br />sta $400a
<br />lda periodHi
<br />sta $400b
<br />
<br />which could easily be changed to;
<br />
<br />lda periodLo
<br />ldx periodHi
<br />sta $400a
<br />stx $400b
<br />
<br />but given blargg's (highly plausible) theory on why the click happens, it could still happen in between the two writes i.e. 3 cycles is not 0 cycles <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />
<br />
<br />The other thing I tried (which failed) was to always save a copy of what is written to the hi period and then when writing the lo period, ORA that with the saved hi period and if it comes out zero, do a ORA #$01 before writing the lo period register. I was trying to engineer it so that $00/$00 would never exist in the registers but it didn't seem to work. Possibly flawed logic and also not a great solution from a musical point of view since it's slightly detuning the period.

<br />
<br />At worse, I think the frequency for a A note on a particular octave is $fd. Maybe you could fine-tune everything a bit up, so that it is something around $fb or $fa. Then you can get vibratoes of a great depth without ever touching the infamous $ff/$100 barrier. Then it would fix all triangle and square channel problems on vibratoes (except those of a really big depth) - but it won't fix pitch slides (which is less noticeable as the click happens only once). Lazy, but might work surprisingly well.  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=":wink:" title="Wink" />

<br />Yep, both methods. Don't take my word for it though - the code I'm using is there in the post and is compilable <img src="./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" />
<br />
<br />Just to be clear - it actually only happens on the triangle voice. I think it's because only the triangle voice has it's output silenced when the period is 00/00?
<br />
<br />Out of everything I've tried the changing-write-order-depending-on-direction method of yours seems to yield the best (but not 100%) results so I think I'm going to go with that.
<br />
<br />At least until blargg comes up with a solution <img src="./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" />

<br />When the pitch is decreasing, and the period increasing, you're doing $ff -&gt; $100 you want to write first to $400b ($00 -&gt; $01) and then to $400a ($ff -&gt; $00) so the period is never $0000.

<br />
<br />This should always work.
<br />Also, I don't see the problem of the dummy value write. Sure the period will be wrong for a few cycles, but not long enough to cause (especially if the high dummy value is $07, which makes the counter less likely to be clocked- and if clocked it's only once so not an issue).

<br />I know but other problem arises when changing the high period of square voices, the phase is reset. I like to bring up lazy solutions to problems, because those solutions would have been more likely seen implemented in games in the 80's than crazy solutions which relies on obscure tricks on the hardware and that few if any emulator supports (blarrg's sweep counter abuse method).

<br />The square channel click is a different issue and is overcome in both NTRQ and Pulsar using blargg's clever trick with the sweep registers.
