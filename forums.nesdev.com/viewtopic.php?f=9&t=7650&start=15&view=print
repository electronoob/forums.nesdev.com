<br />
<br /><strong>1.</strong> You have more control over how you distribute your tiles. There is no way to increase the background tile count (with bankswitching you can, of course, but I'm not talking about that), but you can increase the sprite tile count at the cost of background tiles if you wish too.
<br />
<br /><strong>2.</strong> Tiles can be used for both the background and sprites. This is useful for drawing things that move but can also be used as static background objects. Background objects can be destroyed and it's pieces can fly away, items can be available at fixed locations but they can also pop from enemies and fly around, all without having to duplicate tiles. Also, even you don't plan on moving certain objects around, you might still want to display them with sprites every once in a while just to use the sprite palettes, which could make your game look more colorful.
<br />
<br /><strong>3.</strong> This is not specific to using sprites from both pattern tables, but with 8x16 sprites you get to display more sprite pixels per screen. O course there will be the occasional blank tile because object heights are not always multiples of 16, but since you can better distribute your tiles the blank ones are not so bad.
<br />
<br />All 3 advantages are very important in nearly all my projects, and I find it sad the the most popular mapper ever prevents me from doing those things if I want to use the scanline counter, and without a scanline counter there's little advantage in using an MMC3.
<br />
<br />I'm not sure what the best solution for a development mapper would be. Maybe if not many commercial games use the alternate scanline counting of the MMC3, or if the person making the carts doesn't care about the games that do (i.e. he's focused on homebrews rather than repros), an MMC3 clone with a proper scanline counter would be great.
<br />
<br />If the scanline counter could be fixed to work consistently no matter what patter table configuration you use, that would be great, because we homebrewers wouldn't have to give up on built-in features of the console and most of the existing MMC3 games would work just fine too.
<br />
<br />Maybe looking at how the scanline counter in the MMC5 works instead of pointlessly studying the MMC3 one could allow us to make a mapper that's essentially an MMC3 with a more consistent scanline counter. Now that's something I'd pay for!

<br />
<br />That is an very good suggestion. I will look into this! I too was sad to learn that you cannot use both pattern tables for sprite tiles with MMC3. My adventure game demo uses this.
<br />
<br />As for making repros with this cart, I am not too worried about that side of the market. It's not something I want to pursue, and I'll leave it at that. I want to open the door to developing MMC3-based software secure in knowing you have a path to silicon already laid out for you.
<br />
<br />Having good support for a debugging emulator is my top priority. This isn't worth anything without it. That is why I am using MMC3 as the model instead of making up my own mapper from scratch. If I did a custom mapper I'd have to write mapper plugins for Nintendulator and FCEUX at the very least to make it a viable development platform, and then there is the complication that it is much harder to release your software as a ROM image intended to be played on an emulator.
<br />
<br /><div class="quotetitle">koitsu wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">1) Method of programming. There's no mention if these are EEPROM boards or what -- just a vague mention of "USB interface for reading and writing all memory space". I could interpret that as "you can use USB to flash an image to the board", or as "the USB interface acts as a real-time debugger of some sort" (how that would work is beyond me). <br /><br />2) Will this thing have a proper/reliable IRQ counter per MMC3B standard? <br /><br />3) Will the boards, for $50, include the necessary chips for things like battery-backed SRAM, etc.? (If not that's fine, just wanting clarification) </div>
<br />
<br />1) You will plug the cart into your computer via USB and use an application I will provide to flash a ROM image and SRAM dump onto the cartidge (while it is still in your NES, but with the power off). The same interface will also allow reading back the ROM and SRAM images. A command-line version of this software will be available for integration into a build script. The software will be DotNET-based and compatible with Linux via Mono. This will not include any debugging facility as there is not enough access to the system via the cartridge connector.
<br />
<br />2) I will not release this cart unless the IRQ counter works correctly. Otherwise there is not much use for this cart.
<br />
<br />3) The $50 price tag that I am hoping to hit is for a fully assembled board with surface-mount ROM and RAM chips, USB interface, mapper, battery and all other components already soldered on. This will NOT include a plastic shell as I have no way of manufacturing those. It will be a bare PCB hanging out of your dev system.

I'd not be interested until there is a board I can easily reproduce programs on. The USB suite would be nice, but it's useless if there's no board offered to put these on without the USB developer tools. But even then, I'd not buy the developer version because I don't test every build on cart. So the development cart is useless. And plus for the $50 price tag if that is the final price, the proportionment for that single development cart and a PowerPak would make the PowerPak a better option because for $80 more, you get pretty close to every Nintendo mapper and tons of 3rd party. That's just what I see. If I'mm dropping $50 on a cart for one chip, I'd probably do the full $130 for powerpak. It's in the middle of a RetroPak and a PowerPak basically, and that's not an easy place to be.

<br />That and the developer board can be considered the prototype of the repro board.

<br />Adding mapper support to emulators is not impossible.  After all, at one point the existing mappers were not implemented.
<br />
<br />If the CPLD can be programmed for a variety of mappers, then that would be great.
<br />
<br />I'd like 8K (or even 4K) prog-rom bank switching, 32K char-ram, switchable in 256-byte blocks (yeah, I know, that would require a shit-ton of CPLD capability), in-game accessible flash storage or on-cart serial eeprom for saved games, 8K (or more) sram (skip the battery if cart has eeprom / flash)
<br />
<br />edit: and a usable scan-line counter that can fire at least twice per frame, on user-selectable lines.
<br />
<br />If you are making a repro, then of course you need a real MMC3.  However, if that goal is to support future homebrew titles that want nifty features, then I see no need to restrict ourselves to establish mappers.  If we make a game that is popular enough and want to release a rom image, the emus can be updated to support our new mappers.

<br />
<br />You make some good points but your vision seems somewhat boxed.  Conceptually (idealistically) I fully agree that using a non-existent mapper is feasible, what I feel you may be forgetting is that many mainstream emulators *haven't* been updated recently.
<br />
<br />Let's face it and admit it right now: on the Windows and OS X platforms, people predominantly use Nestopia, which hasn't received an official update in almost 3 years.  There are already unofficial builds of Nestopia out in the wild; do you want another one thrown into the mix, making Nestopia into, effectively, MAME?  (That is to say: 6 zillion versions of the same emulator, all with different tweaks/features/capabilities, forcing people to have basically 6 versions of the same emulator on their systems just to run different games)
<br />
<br />People generally don't use Nintendulator to play games (it lacks user-friendly features that appeal to folks who, say, hook their PCs up to their home TVs, etc.), even though there's this idea running around that "Nintendulator has the most accurate PPU emulation of all emulators".  That doesn't mean anything to someone who just wants to play/enjoy a game (nor should it).
<br />
<br />Most people these days, not surprisingly (though depressingly), choose to use emulators as a full-on replacement for a NES.  I'll admit happily that 90% of the time I use Nestopia instead of my actual NES (partially because the video output of the toploader is so poor[1]), and on very rare occasion use Nintendulator (I tend to use that for debugging/romhacking stuff and often wish its GUI features were less "wonky" in their behaviour).
<br />
<br />TL;DR -- if you want to guarantee that your game gets the widest audience, you'll use a well-established mapper that works in the majority of mainstream emulators *and* is supported on PowerPak (or can be easily reproduced on a native cart).  That leaves the "simple" mappers, and things like MMC1 and MMC3.  People are going to go through hoops and jumps just to play your "weird game" on a "weird mapper" -- and though I'm technically skilled, even I won't go through those hoops.  :-)
<br />
<br />[1]: You know, the never-ending thread about that problem still has no concrete and well-written procedure on how to fix the problem on NTSC, where to get replacement parts (don't tell me to get them from a front-loader), what to solder to what, providing photos/diagrams, etc...

<br />
<br />How about using a subset of the MMC5 functionality (assuming we can wrap our heads around the IRQ behavior, I have yet to read through Drag's full post on the matter). I think if we leave out CHR-ROM support and 100% of the EXRAM features as well as the multiplier and sound it could fit on a fairly inexpensive CPLD.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Seems less useful to clone MMC3, there are far more people who will want it so they can build bootlegs of Final Fantasy 3 or whatnot compared to developers who could get good use out of it.  That's one of the reasons I've completely stayed away from cloning mappers - they're far more useful to 'repro' builders than developers.
<br />
<br />There's not much one can do about people that are using emulators that were written 5 or 10 years ago without a mapper SDK.  Distribute a modern emu with your ROM?  The game is supposed to be written for an NES, this <em>is</em> NESdev, after all.
<br />
<br />Well, I guess this cart sorta competes with mine, but mine sounds a lot cheaper so far (a little different, but better than MMC3 IMHO).  Supplying a dev cart at cost would be an awesome thing to do, but at $50 I'm sure you could do much, much better than that.  I want to build mine in quantity, and the development version is 100% identical to the game-release version.  The only difference is that with the dev version you would use an RS232/USB connector to the NES's controller port (or a CopyNES, whatever you have).  But the cool thing is the port adapter is then usable with any cart.. it's not just tied to this one.
<br />
<br />So what's the advantage of having USB on the cart instead of on the NES?

<br />I haven't done any (yet), but I'm almost 100% sure they could be built with free tools, because it's just standard Win32 API with no frills.
