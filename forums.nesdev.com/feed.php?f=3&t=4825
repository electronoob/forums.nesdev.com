Simple mappers aren't very hard to do, so mapper number doesn't really matter.<br /><br />I hear the easiest game to get working is Balloon Fight.<br /><br />Otherwise, just play various games on it.  <br />Some games can be used as simple tests to see if you're doing it right or not.  A very badly implemented MMC3 mapper will crash on Kick Master for instance.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=53">Dwedit</a> — Wed Feb 04, 2009 3:32 pm</p><hr />

Other than that, I'm not aware of any real list other than random postings on the forum.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"><br />I am thinking each mapper has a particular rom that works best at excercising all that mapper's features, but many roms might only use a subset of a mapper's capabilities.<br /></div><br /><br />I tried to make mention of games with possible mapper issues in <a href="http://www.romhacking.net/docs/362/" class="postlink">these mapper docs</a> &lt;/plug&gt; (note that RHDN seems to be having server trouble at the moment, so you might have trouble downloading).  I think the wiki probably mentions such games as well.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"><br />Also, is there is a particular order people tend to test/develop against?<br /></div><br /><br />You can do it in any order, really.  The only thing is that to test a particular aspect of the system, you might need to rely on other parts of the system, first.  For example you can't very well test NMIs if you don't have a functioning CPU -- so in that case you'd have to make sure your CPU is good before working on NMI details.<br /><br />But other than that, any order is fine.  I generally tried to focus on native NES issues first before working on any mappers.  So like...<br /><br />- CPU<br />- PPU and video output<br />- NMI<br />- Joypad<br />- CPU Timing and CPU/PPU interation<br />- Sprite 0 hit<br />- Sprite overflow<br />- $2004 read during rendering trickery<br />- APU and audio output<br />- Frame IRQs<br />- DMC stolen cycles<br />- DMC IRQs<br />- then start with mappers and/or other input devices.<br /><br />One thing to note is that the CPU should be nailed as soon as possible<br /><br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"><br />For example, my emulator is in its infancy and doesnt even have sprite support written, but thankfully I was able to run nestest to hammer out all the bugs in my CPU.<br /></div><br /><br />CPU is very very important because it can be difficult to tell a CPU bug from any other kind of bug... like say, a sprite bug... or even a file loading bug, or anything else.  If a sprite is glitched and you go dig through your sprite code for hours (or days!  or even weeks/months!) only to find that your sprite code is fine, and the bug was in your CPU.<br /><br />So get the CPU down first... then it will be easier to properly identify and attack bugs further down the line.<br /><br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"><br />I imagine I next one I will tackle is Blargg's Official_6502_test (although to get that one, I will need basic scrolling and MMC1 support)<br /></div><br /><br />If nestest.nes passes, you should be fine for most commercial games.  I wouldn't worry about adding MMC1 support and whatnot just to try this ROM -- I'd wait until you would normally choose to add that stuff and try the ROM when it's conveinient to do so.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"><br />PS: Writing and working on this emulator is turning out to be a lot of fun.<br /></div><br /><br />Isn't it though?  I had a lot of fun with mine, too.  =D<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=33">Disch</a> — Wed Feb 04, 2009 3:07 pm</p><hr />
