<br />
<br />I actually only meant when a demo is ready. That should only be a few months away I'm hoping...we'll see how it goes. This project beats all my previous projects in the areas of: time spent on it,  consistent schedule for working on it,  % complete, etc. So I don't want to screw it up and jinx myself  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" />

<br />
<br />It seems all those Bob Rost class games including Sack of Flour: Heart of Gold only work in JNes, and FCE and its variants, that I have tried. Some of them were cute/cool concepts for games. I think it'd be neat if someone rom-hacked the crap out of one of those or provided a patch so it would work on real hardware (which may be a complex task, especially if they have a huge amount of stuff in their vblank for example). Who's gonna do that though? =)
<br />
<br />*edit* That Neotoxin demo was amazing! Too bad that game never got finished.

<br />
<br />The Painguin game was made by a student attending the class of Bob Rost. <a href="http://bobrost.com/nes/" class="postlink">http://bobrost.com/nes/</a>.  He wrote the qbasic game maker.  This site has all his students projects, including his own (Sack of Flour) which actually seems like an OK game.
<br />
<br />I wish they had these types of classes at my school....
