<br />"lda #$00, x" simply makes no sense... What does one intent to do with this command? Do you mean it should be treated the same as "lda $00, x"? Allowing the use of "#" when representing addresses could make things really confusing. Addresses don't have a "#", that's a simple rule.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />The argument to an opcode is normally a constant memory address. Even if you use some named identifier for a memory address in your assembly code the assembler will  translate it to a constant address.
<br />
<br />However, some opcodes take what is called an <em>immediate </em>address, which is not really an address at all but a value. That is usually denoted with a # infront of it.
<br />
<br />So, indexing can be done with a constant address, using lda $00,x or lda MyAddress,x where MyAddress is some memory location known to the assembler.
<br />
<br />lda #$00,x makes no sense at all, since #$00 implies the value $00 and not the address $00.
<br />
<br />EDIT: 
<br />You posted while I was typing <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />. That you wanted it to add was the other possibility I though of other then having confused constant value with constant address. Bah.

<br />
<br />i'll think next time before asking a question that may be met with pedantic remarks about assembly fundamentals
<br />
<br />it's just that with all the addressing modes of the 6502, it's hard to remember exactly what's allowed. one might conclude that since 
<br />when x=3, <div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">&nbsp;LDA $0303,x</div> means LDA $0306, maybe <div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">lda #$80,x</div> when x=7F, could mean lda #$FF?

<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">ldx #$04<br />lda table+$10,x ; loads a with $14<br />ldx #$FF<br />lda table+$FF,x ; loads a with $FE<br /><br />table: .byte $00,$01,$02...$FE,$FF,$00,$01,$02...$FE ; 511 entries total</div>
<br />If you put the table in zero-page, it would have the syntax LDA $n,x to add n and X and put it into A, it'd only need 256 bytes, and the operation would only take two bytes for the opcode and 4 cycles, but then you wouldn't have zero-page available. The equivalent (CLC, TXA, ADC #n) only takes 6 cycles, and carry is often in a definite state, knocking it down to 3 bytes and 4 cycles.

<br />Actually, if you loaded A with something other than 0, it would basically serve as:
<br />
<br />clc
<br />lda #immediate
<br />adc X
<br />
<br />So lda #immediate,x would be really handy.
<br />
<br />And I really don't think it's at all odd to figure that lda #immediate,x is a real instruction. But I suppose x is an index and it makes sense seeing it that way.

<br />
<br /> If I were to speculate I would think it means something more like lda (#imm,PC,x) similar to the 68k. PC being the current PC of the instruction so no need to have it in the syntax. So you'd have pc+#imm, indexed by X. X would wrap, #imm would carry on the PC MSB.

<br />You didn't forget, because it can't. =) Celius was just explaining what you wanted to do. Blargg's code is the one that is valid and does what you want (CLC, TXA, ADC #n).
<br />
<br />Some time ago we <a href="http://nesdev.com/bbs/viewtopic.php?t=3682" class="postlink">discussed</a> the use of a simple look-up table that would extend the functionality of registers X and Y.

<br />That's what I thought too at first, actually that could be done as LDA *,x but it would be 4 cycles (instead of presumably 3, if that instruction existed).

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />So ultimately, the 6502 has more addressing modes than just immediate (LDA #imm) and zero-page indirect (LDA (0,x)) because common operations would require too many instructions. You often want to access a fixed 16-bit address, so there's LDA addr, and you often want to do a table lookup, so there's LDA addr,X and LDA addr,Y. It's not that often that you want to load A with X or Y plus some constant. Also, doing so manually isn't nearly as involved as doing indexed addressing manually would be:
<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">; rough equivalent to LDA addr,X<br />txa<br />clc<br />adc #&lt;addr<br />sta temp<br />lda #&gt;addr<br />adc #0<br />sta temp+1<br />ldx #0<br />lda &#40;0,x&#41;</div>
