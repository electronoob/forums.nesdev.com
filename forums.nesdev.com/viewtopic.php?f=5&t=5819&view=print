Heres something I wonder if someone can assist me with, or point me in the right direction about&#058;  I just bought this portable DVD player - WINTAL PDVD636, and it includes a disc that has 150 nintendo roms on it.  Thats the main reason I bought the thing, because it plays NES games!  Naively I thought I could burn NES roms onto a disc and put it into the unit and play those roms.  Turns out the disc that came with the dvd unit, which is explorable by PC cdrom drive, has all these roms saved in a folder, and the roms are listed as Gxxx.bin files.  So, does anyone out here have a line on how a bloke like me could get a NES rom and put it on a disc that this WINTAL dvd unit can read and play?  I gots to get me (and wife) playin these old school games!   I there a way to convert .nes files to .bin files?  Does anyone know anything about what Im talking about??  Thanks

<br />You want to look at the first 16 bytes.  If the first three bytes (look at the right side) say "NES", then the fourth byte is 1A, it's a NES file.  Compare to another NES rom.
<br />
<br />And these DVD players are known for having spotty quality emulation.  Right now, the Wii has much better emulators available.

It's a good hex editor. Not awesome, but it doesn't require installation. Just unzip the exe, and load up the file.

The last time we heard about a DVD player playing NES games, it was in a <a href="http://nesdev.com/bbs/viewtopic.php?t=1179" class="postlink">discussion about an ebook reader</a>. The player turned out to be incompatible with a few techniques used to fit a screenful of text into RAM.
<br />
<br />Another thing that might make it easier: Exactly how many bytes in size are the ROM files for older games like Balloon Fight, Mario Bros., and Super Mario Bros.?

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Hmmm, okay.  I got the HXD program, opened it up, loaded up balloon fight, which is not called balllon fight as the file name on the cd, instead its called:  G026.BIN.  Now, are the first 16 bytes displayed as the first line in the opened file in HXD? (The very first line reads - 
<br />Offset (h) 00 01 02 03 etc...)  The line directly beneath I guess is the first line , it starts with 00000000 then 3C 08 40 etc... and at the very right is closely spaced symbols and dots, &lt;.@.%.i...... so on.  But I do not see NES anywhere or 1A.  Balloon fight  is 96.0 KB, Super Mario is also 96.0 KB, and unfortunately the disc does NOT have mario bros (1) - too bad.
<br />But it does have Goonies 2... sweet...  Also, Mega Man is called Rockman, which I believe is the Japanese name of that game.
<br />Thanks

I take it then that the manufacturers of this aforementioned device didnt want eager beavers to put together their own playable game discs.  Poop.  But still theres got to be a way to do it, these guys couldnt have made it so amazingly hack proof that sufficient elbow grease cant get at it, I will research...

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Well, you gotta find out how these BIN files are put together. The best thing you can do is compare the file of a common game with it's .NES counterpart and see what is different. Maybe the original ROM isn't even visible, maybe it's encrypted or something, in which case it will be much harder to reverse engineer.
<br />
<br />Transferring pirated games around here is not allowed, otherwise I would tell you to post one of the binary files so that other people here could take a look at it.

<br />what do the directions say? generally devices that include pirated copy's of old games along with emulator functions don't try to stop you from playing whatever.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Thanks for the info thus far.  I wanted to say that in 1985 my parents got me the Nintendo entertainment system with light gun, mario/duck hunt.  I was 10.  I still remember the price of that was 262 CDN, which would now be like, a thousand bucks.  Ive had 4 NES systems before, I was buying games as a teenager at 50 - 60 dollars each, I still have about 35 carts.  Thats some major money, but Im not trying to legitimize piracy in stating this, just trying to express to you all that I have in fact made a relatively significant contribution to the developmental causes of Nintendo throughout the years.  (not to mention 3 gameboys, 2 SNES, a DS, and dozens of games for those, and I still might buy a Wii)  Imagine spending 175 - 200 on a game right now, with the graphics and sound and so on of say... Lode Runner?  I still remember shelling out 110 for Street Fighter 2 turbo for SNES in 1991...  Holy crow, now I wish I saved all that for a house!  Just kidding. Anyway thats my waffle on down memory (card) lane.  That still doesnt mean I condone piracy, but I do admit it occupies somewhat of a gray area on my moral compass.  I do respect the rationale of restraint when it comes to issues of piracy.    Im gonna follow your guys advice and analyze the contents of these files in Hex editor, burn a CD and so forth, and report the results.  The crux of the thing I guess is that I hate playing console games on PCs, and Im reluctant to buy a Wii for the purpose of playing these old school titles, and this cheap little device seems almost perfect for me in this case, if I can get some other games to play on it.  Of course even if I cant, the thing is still cool enough for under a hundred buckaroos!

And because PocketNES for GBA and nesDS for DS are maintained by someone who cares about emulation, they are probably compatible with more games and fewer glitches than a DVD player will ever be.

<br />
<br />Also there are NES emulators for the PS1, DreamCast, and PS2 if you are interested in playing on a TV rather than a PC. The PS1 emulator was quite good from what I remember. It was called IMBNES (ItMightBeNES). You can play it on any PS1 with a simple swap trick. DreamCast you just burn a CD. PS2 is more complicated to run homebrew apps on.
