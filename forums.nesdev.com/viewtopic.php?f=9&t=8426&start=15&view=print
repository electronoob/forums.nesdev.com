<br />
<br />See? They really match each other!
<br />
<br />But you are unlucky about MMC3 glop top, it doesn't match anything! So there is no way we can find out what the hell it is! It really has extra address lines and so called registers! 
<br />
<br />I don't know if it is really possible to control PRGA19 and CHRA19 (and maybe CHRA18?) with the help of some TTL chips.
<br />
<br />Another issue is about size of PRG and CHR. They don't match your ROM size at all! I don't have any idea how this is possible on earth! Maybe those Chinese guys shared CHR between two Rockman version!

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Well thanks for your help, that's why I wanted to use the TTL logic in the first place. There are countless of pirate mapper globtops with different functions. And you cannot believe that all pirated MMC3 carts use that "AX5202P" you've found in one of them. There even may be more "components" under that glob.
<br />I went on this road many times and never got positive results. But it's fun to play in paintbrush <img src="./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" />

There's nothing special about it, it's active High. <br />But I don't think you should rely on original chip pinout, those chinese components covered with epoxy can have different pinouts, and the routes that are visible after exiting the glob can already be switched. AND you don't know if there are not any other "miracles" under the epoxy glob.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">FARID wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">Another issue is about size of PRG and CHR.

<br />Are you taking into account that the 27C160 is 16-bit? If it's used in 8-bit mode, I don't see any "impossibility" in that...

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />The PRG-ROM is certainly 16 megabits (equal to a 27C160). And yes ofcourse it's used in 8bit mode. CHR-ROM is 4 megabits, the first 2 megabits are for Rockman 5. The next 1 megabit is Rockman 3. The next 1 megabit (but only the first 8 kilobytes really) is for the Menu Select graphics. 
<br />
<br />Like I said before, the gloptop that contains the MMC3 clone also contains other mapper functions for the multi-cart capability. This extra capability could be added onto a normal MMC3 with either a CPLD or enough 74 series chips probably. I've already outlined what capability and for what hardware purpose some of the multi cart function is about.
<br />
<br />Most of the components are wired up just like a normal MMC3 game. But some extra logic controls things beyond the MMC3 like the higher PRG-ROM lines, CHR-ROM lines, and CHR chip control for CHR-RAM or CHR-ROM enable.

<br />Please complete the diagram based on my suggestions and make it a one piece picture. Maybe some other one gets interested in it and wants to continue the work. Which software did you use to draw the lines? It is really a great job!
<br />
<br />@ MottZilla
<br />If PRG is a 27C160 then where is these pins :
<br />/E
<br />/G
<br />/BYTE VPP
<br />Q8~Q14
<br />Q15A-1
<br />
<br />Maybe it doesn't need Q pins which are output, but I don't believe it doesn't need /E, /G and /BYTE VPP then where are they?
<br />
<br />If CHR is a 27C040 then it just needs A10~A18 to operate at 512KB but as you can see there is another pin which I guess it is A19, if it is not A19 then what is that pin?!
<br />
<br />As you can see :
<br />PRG is missing some pins so it is not 27C160 but 27C080
<br />CHR has more pins than necessary so it is not 27C040 but 27C080
<br />
<br />My 6-in-1 Rockman (Unl)[U][!].nes is :
<br />Size : 2,621,516 bytes 
<br />MD5 : 7E4A01CC85CEBBD7181DA504DAAC6950
<br /><strong>Length : 28004C</strong>
<br />
<br />Somehow I feel that it is not in correct size :
<br />256 + 128 + 120 + 8 + 256 + 256 + 512 + 512 + 256 + 128 + 8 + 120 = 2560 KB
<br />2560 * 1024 = 2621440 + 16 (Header) = 2621456 bytes --&gt; <strong>Length 280010</strong>
<br />

<br />
<br />Most of them should correct. But this thing is really complex than I expect it!
<br />
<br />MMC3 has some extra pins :
<br />CHR A18 (CHR + MMC3)
<br />CHR A19 (CHR + MMC3)
<br />CHR /A13 (Connector + CHR + MMC3)
<br />
<br />PRG A1 (Connector + PRG + MMC3)
<br />PRG A4 (Connector + PRG + MMC3)
<br />PRG A12 (Connector + PRG + MMC3)
<br />PRG A19 (PRG + MMC3)
<br />PRG OE (PRG + MMC3) (?)
<br />
<br />I am not sure about PRG OE, because normally OE of PRG connects to GND. There are 2 GNDs at PRG, there is a chance that one of them is OE and then this pin of MMC3 can have another function.
<br />
<br />After all now you know which pins are critical so you need some other TTL to use on these pins.

<br />
<br />The BYTE signal is related to 27C160's dual 8bit/16bit operation. The MaskROM won't have that. But it will have /CE and /OE signals. It will have D0 to D7 and all appropriate Address Lines and power and ground. Most of the upper address lines from PRG-ROM will go from one gloptop to the other. I think the top 4 lines, A20 to A17, shall all go to additional non-MMC3 logic. A16 to A0 should connect to MMC3 logic or Cartridge Connector normally.

<br />P.S.: I was testing it on the real hardware: NTSC US NES + Nintendo TSROM board with CHRAM (make it wprk like TGROM) mod.

<br />Anyone with the original pirate cart can confirm if Rockman 1 has slowdowns ? If that is not the case, it could be that the menu program explicitly disables the IRQ timer on the mapper chip.
