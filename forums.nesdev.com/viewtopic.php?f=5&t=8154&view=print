<br />The show will be <a href="http://www.ustream.tv/channel/zuntata" class="postlink">streamed live via Ustream</a> starting at the following times (for those who can't do/don't want to do timezone conversion):
<br />
<br />09/23 @ 05:00 PDT (UTC-7)
<br />09/23 @ 08:00 EDT (UTC-4)
<br />09/23 @ 12:00 UTC
<br />09/23 @ 21:00 JST (UTC+9)
<br />
<br />The show involves predominantly spoken (some written) Japanese.  If you can't understand, watch anyway and enjoy the music.  The last few shows got up to 2500 live viewers, which was amazing; I kept waiting for Ustream to run out of bandwidth.  :-)
<br />
<br /><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zuntata" class="postlink">Don't know who Zuntata is?</a>  Shame on you.  Most people know them for their music to Darius, Bubble Bobble, and Ninja Warriors, but for me it was the work Masahiko TAKAKI did on the original Rastan arcade.

<br />OMG you're kidding me!  I used to pump quarters into that machine *just* to hear the music!!  Well...the game was pretty awesome, too!
<br />
<br />I remember being totally psyched that Taito was advertising an Amiga version.  Every month I'd get a new magazine with the same ad.  Years went by...I had dreams of signing up to help Taito port the damn thing, because they must obviously have been having a hard time at it--their advertising people got ahead of them.  Somewhere along the way it was dropped.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />My CANDY 25 cabinet downstairs in my garage has a Rastan board near it.  :-)  My all-time-favourite arcade game is Black Dragon/Black Tiger though (Capcom not Taito), but Rastan comes in a close second.
<br />
<br />Also, I don't think Masahiko TAKAKI (usually known and referred to as "MAR") will be on this show tonight, but there's a pre-recorded show on the ZUNTATA channel on Ustream where MAR made an appearance (wearing a Bubble Bobble T-shirt) and folks interviewed him/talked to him about god-knows-what.  I have absolutely no idea since I don't understand Japanese (only 5 years of Mandarin but more recently a few years of Korean), so I might have to ask someone to translate that video sometime.
<br />
<br />Anyway, back to the live show (they're interviewing the girl who did the vocals on their latest live music album).
