Well diagnosed! I removed the cpu and installed it into a famicom which was just showing a black screen (guessed cpu). The comboy cpu brought the famicom back to life and took  the sound faults with it, so now I just need a cpu for the comboy.<br />Turns out my scrap famicoms all have bad cpus so that sucks.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=5989">phreak97</a> — Sun Sep 25, 2016 5:22 am</p><hr />
