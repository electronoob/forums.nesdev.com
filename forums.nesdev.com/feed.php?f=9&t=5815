It sounds like you are trying to use a parallel port under Windows to transfer data over a serial data connection. I suggest not using a Parallel port at all, as part of the data loss may be due to DTR rate problems with older hardware and it's easier to utilize hardware-based speed choking on a serial interface.<br /><br />By expansion port, are you meaning the 15-pin (DA-15) port or the Nintendo-specific port on the FDS/Sharp Twin (port B)?<br /><br />If your software is simple enough, you could always recompile it under BSD or something else and check to see if it's a Kernel issue by running it with your hardware under a different OS, however I suspect that this isn’t the case. <br /><br />I also advise against reducing the wire count, as this will only likely result in higher degradation of your signals. What spec wire are you using and are you sure that it is properly shielded and insulated?<br /><br />Remember that the slower interface from the FDS will require more shielding and insulation in your cable, depending on its length, as it is more susceptible to data corruption from ES/EM interference. <br /><br />-Xious<br /><br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">kyuusaku wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"><br /><div class="quotetitle">Xious wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">Did you code custom tools to use your cable design?

Pasofami? That's a new one on me and I'll have to do some research down that avenue.<br /><br />Frankly, I'm a hardware engineer (semi-retired) and writing software of this nature is not in my realm of experience. When I was in college, Cobol was the "in" language to learn...<br /><br />Did you code custom tools to use your cable design? If you have a schematic, I'd be happy to both build one and possibly work out some of the problems. If I can manage an improved design, would you feel it worthwhile to exchange that for whatever tools you use or for writing services?<br /><br />What problems are you encountering with your cable? <br /><br />If you or anybody out there would be willing to write the patches, I would be happy to both compensate you for your time and supply original diskettes (of the original games to be patched) to use in the process. More than anything else, I'd like English-language versions of 'Deep Dungeon' and 'Cleopatra', although I'm not 100% certain if there is a translation for the latter. <br /><br />As I said before, if I wanted pirated games, I could buy them all day long from China for very little money and thus having this type of setup just to duplicate FamiDisks is not time-money practical. <br /><br />Being able to write the patched English games is, however, of great interest to me, as I can't read the Japanese characters and learning a new language at my age is not likely to happen. I have all the documentation I would need now to make disk-to-disk copies, but that doesn't help me with my primary concern. <br /><br />I frankly don’t even see why that is such a large concern here. I guess I’ll just have to photograph my disk collection just to show you what I mean… <br /><br />Then again, I still have yet to U/L the photos of the NES2 logic board, so I may as well do both at once.<br /><br />-Xious<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">kyuusaku wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"><br /><div class="quotetitle">Xious wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">I can order disks all day long from Rising or other Nippon-based importers, but why should I replace what I already have if I can fix it with equipment I already own.<br /></div><br />Because you can't apparently?<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"><br />I’m certainly amicable to having somebody else write the patched disks, but as far as I can tell, nobody is able to do that, or I'd have had an answer on how to do so on my own already.<br /></div><br />Anybody that can write disks can, and there are a number of us out there.
