For a linear game that's only 1 screen tall this doesn't make much sense, but in maps that are several screens tall the amount of data saved when compressing the sky is huge. A screen with just blue sky and clouds can be repeated forever without drawing much attention. The same goes for dirt/rocks/etc that usually exist below the floor.<br /><br />The trick is to reuse the more generic pieces a lot, but reserve the more characteristic ones for special places. You can also "decorate" the screens with objects to make them slightly different.<br /><br />Looking at the maps in Sonic 1 and Sonic CD (the 2 games that use 256x256 blocks, the others use 128x128) I really don't see that much repetition:<br /><br /><a href="http://www.soniczone0.com/games/sonic1/downloads/s1-ghz-act1map.png" class="postlink">http://www.soniczone0.com/games/sonic1/downloads/s1-ghz-act1map.png</a><br /><a href="http://www.soniczone0.com/games/sonic1/downloads/s1-lz-act3map.png" class="postlink">http://www.soniczone0.com/games/sonic1/downloads/s1-lz-act3map.png</a><br /><a href="http://www.soniczone0.com/games/soniccd/downloads/scd-mm-zone1amap.png" class="postlink">http://www.soniczone0.com/games/soniccd/downloads/scd-mm-zone1amap.png</a><br /><br />Of course that when zoomed out like this the parts that are just solid ground stand out a lot, but the areas that you actually see during gameplay don't feel repetitive at all IMO. I think that the huge levels are worth it.

These screens are located at the very beginning of the ROM.  Actual "areas" that the hero can walk around on without loading a new area are generally 8x8 screens or smaller (largest is the Cordel Plain, the area outside of Brynmaer and also the save in the desert with the power ring).  The cart dedicates 64K to storing these "screens", or 1/4 of the prog-rom space, and probably another 32K or so to store the meta-screen ("area") tables and metatile -&gt; tile tables.<br /><br />Having the data uncompressed makes it easier for the game engine to quickly do terrain navigability tests for each actor.  The game play is very smooth.  CPU time is not wasted doing lots of decompression.  The trade-off is ROM space used and the repetitive nature of the maps (ie, NE corner of every valley looks the same).<br /><br />I would further guess (since I did disassemble the game back in 2000 ~ 2001), that the game uses around 128K to store the maps, their meta info, palettes, rendering code and navigation code.  That's about 50% of the prog-rom space.  For a game that is about exploration and supposedly taking place in Europe and North Africa (hint: flip the world map upside down and compare with the Earth), this seems reasonable to me.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3664">clueless</a> — Tue Apr 05, 2011 1:49 pm</p><hr />

A level that's 128 screens wide (you'd need about 34 seconds to go through all of it at 16 pixels per frame, that's fucking huge) could be defined in only 128 bytes, at the price of having a number of repeated screens (not uncommon in platformers). Of course I'm not considering the space taken by the blocks themselves, but like I said, they can be compressed too.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=95">tokumaru</a> — Tue Apr 05, 2011 1:07 pm</p><hr />

I noticed that the only time the game scrolls super fast is when you're on a lift. I guess the lifts are planned out such that they can't collide with anything, they just have a start point and zoom as fast as possible to the end point.<br /><br />Otherwise, your falling is limited to something like 7 pixels per frame, and your running is even slower than that.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=21">Drag</a> — Tue Apr 05, 2011 11:01 am</p><hr />

Scrolling speed doesn't mean much IMO. With unrolled loops you can write a shitload of data to the PPU during VBlank, and decoding one more row/column of tiles from the level map isn't that complicated/slow either, considering that most games have a block size of 16x16 pixels, and once you reach those it doesn't make much difference whether you will read all 4 tiles or just 2.<br /><br />My game can scroll pretty fast, 16 pixels per frame both vertically and horizontally if necessary (updating a total of 128 bytes + attributes). If that happens every frame though there won't be a lot of VBlank time left for other updates, so palette and pattern animations might start to lag. But I doubt my camera will move that fast diagonally for several consecutive frames.<br /><br />I have to agree that not many NES games are as fast as Bio Force Ape, but I have no idea why. I really don't think the hardware imposes severe limitations on scrolling speed.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=95">tokumaru</a> — Mon Apr 04, 2011 5:26 pm</p><hr />

Well, if nothing else, Bio Force Ape proves that the NES is capable of BLAST PROCESSING, given how fast the screen can scroll here. When scrolling, it updates two rows/cols of tiles at a time, plus the row/col of attribute bytes. The game doesn't scroll faster than 15 pixels in any direction though.<br /><br />Still though, that's fast. :T<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=21">Drag</a> — Mon Apr 04, 2011 12:41 pm</p><hr />
