<br />I 100% agree. Especially considering there is enough info avaialbe arround, and that someone who has a bit of experience in electronics should be able to figure things by themselves. Other people shouldn't bother bootleging carts anyway.

Well, I don't mind people wanting to make repros/bootlegs, there are many good reasons for a person to do this: play games that are hard to find, games of other regions, homebrews, translations, hacks, etc. What bothers me is that nobody seems to do any research before asking. We see the same questions over and over, and this is the annoying part.

<br />
<br />And there is not much reason people who knowns nothing about electronics would want to open crack their carts and makes experiments. Emulators allow you to play games that are hard to find. With accurate emulation and NTSC filter there is NOT any reason not to use them, in fact even since I have a power pak I still prefer playing games emulated because of the better screen of my computer, NTSC emulation, reliable saves, no TV buzzing noise, no graphic glitches and flickering POWER button, etc...

<br />The NES is still a more controlled environment than all the flavors of Windows and Linux out there. Plus, if you are aiming for "that look", nothing is better than an emulator of a system with "that look" (although some people like to mimic some characteristics of old gaming systems while totally ignoring others when developing native PC games that look like old games).

You can learn a lot from working on obscure platforms because of the limitation they have. In that case, the emulators can cut a lot of testing time and if people want to learn from it, they don't need to have that platform with the current state of technologies. Why would they? (and I think we derailed the main thread thought).

<br />I got an answer from the person I helped for the VRCIV so at least I feel better about helping him. Maybe my concern in that thread helped  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" />

<br />Thanks for the help I got it working the reason I wanted to make a repro of these games is because I am a collector and I dont really wont to pay 200.00 plus for these carts they are nice to have but not that nice as for playing them on a emulator I dont enjoy them as much as playing them on the  orginal hardware  and I am always up for helping people if I have the answer and some day I would like to do some Translation Hacks
<br />of a few games
