<br />Amp meter said the top loader was using .39 A, with the switching wall adapter, so maybe if the usb will output this much power then its possible. You may have to take out and jumper accross components like I did in order to avoid losses though.

I even did the same with a tiny LED flashlight module which also uses a buck-type converter, and it was the same. These converters are quite impressive, around 90% or more efficiency. Thermal pictures of the difference would be good. BTW, when comparing two schemes, try to take the thermal pictures from the same angle, so that the only difference is the heat.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">akaviolence wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"><div class="quotetitle">blargg wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">The rectifier probably doesn't generate much heat either. </div>Didn't you see the thermal cam images of the rectifier?

You can still get protection from reverse polarity with a single diode. You could put it in series, which would cause reverse polarity to be ignored. This would still dissipate some heat due to the voltage drop across the diode. You could put it in parallel, with a fuse in series before the diode, so that it crowbars the circuit if polarity is reversed, and blows the fuse. This wouldn't dissipate any power with proper polarity.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">akaviolence wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"><div class="quotetitle">blargg wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">There's nothing keeping you from using a switching wall adaptor as well, further reducing power usage and shipping weight. <br /></div><br />Probably true, though it may have to be of high enough output, there's a 1.1V drop accross the rectifier, but i'm not sure if thats a/c only?</div>
<br />The drop is always there, since there are always two diodes in series, giving double the diode drop. If you do leave the rectifier in, you should get less heat if you use a higher-voltage adaptor, since there will be less current used by the switching regulator. The heat dissipation based on the product of the voltage drop and the current. The voltage drop is fixed (0.6V for silicon diodes). Given that the NES adaptor puts out at least 10 or 11 volts when not fully loaded, it would serve well with a switching regulator. Shipping say a 12V switching wall supply (as opposed to a 9V one) with a NES would be confusing if the person ever tried to use it with an unmodified NES.

<br />
<br />I haven't done much with USB yet, but I believe you get much less than that normally, but there a command to send to the USB host to tell it the current required.  But since USB has sort of turned into a power plug, I'd bet that a lot of stuff out there might ignore that anyways.

<br />Here is the real issue with taking out the rectifier, some one will try to plug an original 9V NES a/c adapter into it and it will burn...

<br />And that's even official since USBIF adopted the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Serial_Bus#Power" class="postlink">Battery Charging Spec</a>. A port can pull up to 1500 mA before trying to communicate.

<br />It's easier to compare when they're from the same angle, and it eliminates the possibility of error due to different angles. It may work fine, but it introduces uncertainty, because one should never fully trust his tools, or trust them more than necessary. When doing science, it's best to control everything not being tested.

<br />One would need a PLL to sync to the color subcarrier, clocking a 42.95 MHz ADC. The maximum and minimum value of the composite signal during each pixel period would give the upper 2 bits; the location of the transitions between minimum and maximum would give the lower 4 bits. But ADCs this fast are expensive, even if you do need only 8 distinct levels. It might be possible to use a slower DAC with more gray levels if Viterbi-type techniques are used.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />So far it's mostly theory. Going by the <a href="http://wiki.nesdev.com/w/index.php/NTSC_video" class="postlink">NTSC video page</a>, we see the color phases:
<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">111111------<br />22222------2<br />3333------33<br />444------444<br />55------5555<br />6------66666<br />------777777<br />-----888888-<br />----999999--<br />---AAAAAA---<br />--BBBBBB----<br />-CCCCCC-----<br />PPPPPPPP &lt;-- pixel width<br /></div>
<br />Each pixel lasts for 8 units of this. As long as a pixel contains at least one transition, the phase can be recovered. It seems so, since each cycle lasts 12 units, thus there are transitions every 6 units. Thus, an 8-unit pixel must contain at least one. If it's gray, of course, it contains zero transitions, and you would detect that as well. I think you could even recover the tint bits, since you'd always get at least one transition of that waveform as well.
<br />
<br />If anyone wanted to seriously make a device to do this (it would literally just connect to the RCA video out, nothing more), we'd need to first write a simulator that generated the composite waveform, then ensured that everything could be recovered in all cases. This would be pretty straight-forward. It's just that the hardware to implement it would be costly, and unless someone stepped up to purchase it AND had the expertise to build it and write the code for the microcontroller, it's going to remain just talked about here.
