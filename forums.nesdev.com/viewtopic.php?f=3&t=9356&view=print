		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I mentioned this in another thread but figured I'd post with some screenshots since I'm still having difficulty isolating exactly what's wrong. Tepples suggested that it might be mixed writes to the PPU registers but I validated that they look okay after chasing a non-bug. Anyways, this issue only shows up in these two games, though I believe it is also the culprit behind scrolling issues that I have in Zelda:<br /><img src="http://i.imgur.com/agYT4.png" alt="Image" /><img src="http://i.imgur.com/Opt2N.png" alt="Image" /><br />Basically the top part of the screen appears to scroll but the lower part seems to &quot;snap&quot; in after the leftmost nametable has been completely replaced. Also, the scrolling of the top half is rarely correct. For example, in Excitebike if a hill is shown on the top half of the screen it's often flat terrain when you drive past (though not always). Games like Castlevania 1 and 2, Mega Man 1 and 2, Duck Tales, etc all scroll just fine. It seems these two have something in common that I can't figure out.<br /><br />And for a bonus question, has anybody seen a case in Zelda 1 where leaving a house bumps you immediately back inside? When I walk into the house where you get the brown sword it works, but when you leave Link immediately re-enters. Makes the game obviously unplayable since you can't leave and get into a sort of endless loop.

Hope you don't have any bad for loops that are stopping too early.<br /><br />How about the full list of 2000 and 2005/2006 writes that happen during a particular frame, and the timestamp (scanline and dot number) that each write occurs at?  If there are any writes that aren't supposed to exist, that would suggest a CPU problem.  If the writes match other emulators, then it's a PPU emulation problem.

I'm not seeing any sprites with a 255 Y. Probably will have to revisit how I'm doing DMA and verify everything there. That sprite is getting evaluated because it's at (0, 0). It also pops up briefly on the black screen before the title screen appears, it's in Zelda, Castlevania 2, literally everywhere. You can't see it in the Excitebike screenshot because I believe the sprite it's using is the audience.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">Dwedit wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">How about the full list of 2000 and 2005/2006 writes that happen during a particular frame, and the timestamp (scanline and dot number) that each write occurs at?

The second $2000 write should happen on the same scanline, 69 dots later.<br />EDIT: oops, that's only true if the game is paused.  When running, the second 2000 write does indeed come much later.<br /><br />The scroll writes ($2005) after the sprite the sprite 0 hit are also about 100 dots late.  FCEUX sees them happening at times around 97 or 104, not 261 or 274.<br /><br />Are you setting X scroll to 0 when it sees a 2000 write, or something like that?</div><br />Nope, the only line affecting the VRAM address in a write to $2000 is this<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">p.VramLatch = (p.VramLatch &amp; 0x73FF) | ((int(v) &amp; 0x03) &lt;&lt; 10)</div><br />If the writes to $2005 after sprite0 is hit are late, that would probably imply that I'm setting the sprite0 hit flag too late then?<br /><br />And yeah, was SMB <img src="./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" /> sorry

You were right Dwedit, scroll was being set to 0 inadvertently by a typo  where I was resetting the VRAM latch to zero, not the first/second write toggle. Scrolling is working great now in both games. Looks like I have something yet to fix though since Mario just gets stuck in midair when you start playing the game though.<br /><br />Here's tepples post that I used to solve the issue: <!-- l --><a class="postlink-local" href="http://forums.nesdev.com/viewtopic.php?p=21745#p21745">viewtopic.php?p=21745#p21745</a><!-- l -->
