Also, I sold thing on Ebay to people living in Mexico 2 or 3 time before and it didn't seem such an issue for them. You also have plenty of forum like Nintendo age where you can easily buy guy from user and Mega Man 6 is really not that expensive. Also, the fact that you seem to make up story won't make it easier for you to get help, specially on making reproduction of common game. Just go to bootgod's cart list and check the list of games using the same board/mapper and stop trying to make everybody cry with your stories <img src="./images/smilies/icon_lol.gif" alt=":lol:" title="Laughing" /> What was your son doing alone in the garage with your Mega Man 6 game in the first place <img src="./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" />
