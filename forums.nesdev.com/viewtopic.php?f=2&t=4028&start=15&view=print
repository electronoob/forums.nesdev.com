<br />
<br />The C64 shooter: <a href="http://doynax.googlepages.com/botst.d64" class="postlink">http://doynax.googlepages.com/botst.d64</a>
<br />Play it in VICE (or some other C64 emulator) with true drive emulation enabled. Don't forget to set up the joystick controls.
<br />
<br />And then there's the polygon demo: <a href="http://doynax.googlepages.com/polynes.nes" class="postlink">http://doynax.googlepages.com/polynes.nes</a>
<br />
<br />Signing up and uploading the files went remarkably smoothly, what with already having a gmail account. Plus they seem to allow direct linking without any any annoying ads or waiting lists. If I'm lucky it might even be a bit reliably than my previous host ;)

<br />Well, both. I know I almost always draw stuff first before pixelizing it (altrough I usually put few detail, because I suck at drawing), and usually the end result is quite different but I don't care that much. I now have a lot of enemies drawn, enough for a game. I just don't have converted them to pixel yet, as I want perfect AI for my first few enemies, and more specifically, for my first boss.
<br />
<br />The polygon demo looks quite cool and promising, and is really fast. However, I'd say 2 polygons aren't enough to hope any 3D graphics yet. 50 or so of them are needed for very simple scenes, I guess (I'm not an expert). So while nobody say it's impossible, I think chances are that this will end up a bit slow but who knowns ?

<br />Luckily the overhead lies more in the number of tiles covered by the lines than the number of lines, so there is hope.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I agree that NESnake 2 is really awesome. Really great music, and overall, a very professional game. I love the detail in that game. Like how the screen shakes when you hit the wall, and the word "Crash" (I think) comes on and the letters are all shaking. It's all very cinematic.
<br />
<br />It seems most of us are still in the process of making our games. I have yet to see someone come out with a homebrew that tells a long and epic tale (Like an RPG or an action RPG). Most homebrew games I've seen are minigames, but they're all pretty good.
<br />
<br />We can't lose hope about cutscenes. It's obvious that wireframe is possible, and to tell the truth, filling is just one step further. However, doynax's demo seems a little complicated, since the triangle appears as if it were colored glass. It's slightly transparent. But doing solid polygons may not be too hard.

<br />
<br />the first is part of a 5 year long project.... coding and recoding.... recoding again.... and again... and again.... I am currently in the middle of the last rewrite... after this the game will be complete. anyways, here is the current, new crap for hotlogic (it now doesnt suck as much)
<br />
<br /><img src="http://elazulspad.net/eric/images/nes/concepts/hlr-newer.png" alt="Image" />
<br />here is the old version from the minigame compo.... it looks better now huh
<br /><img src="http://elazulspad.net/eric/images/nes/concepts/hlr-old.png" alt="Image" />
<br />
<br />
<br />another one i have been working on, is a clone of Gyromite done the way i think it should have been done (no R.O.B. though... sadly <img src="./images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" alt=":(" title="Sad" />).
<br /><img src="http://elazulspad.net/eric/images/nes/concepts/hectorslab.png" alt="Image" />
<br />
<br />and the last one i have been working on, is just a card game... war. i have the engine all done with the exception of the drawing routines. it randomly generates the deck and i can run thru the game by watching the memory. here is what it will look like when it is done

Nothing wrong with writing a NES port.
<br />I can just imagine being given half a dozen NAND gates and 5 minutes, then being asked to construct a full-adder. Sounds like an excellent logic puzzle to me :)
<br />The real question is how to design a decent user interface for such a beast..
