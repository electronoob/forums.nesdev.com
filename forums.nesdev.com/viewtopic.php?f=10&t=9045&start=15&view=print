They don't make chips that size... It's also very unlikely that an 8M 1992 game would use a 256 kbit chip, much less waste half of it.<br /><br />Most likely the problem is that your donor boards are wired for even addresses (using the /LDS) and this game uses odd addresses (using the /UDS), or vice versa.</div>
<br />
<br />If that is the case how would I compensate for that?

<br />
<br />Seeing the original board would ofcourse be the easiest way to figure it out. But if you want to try you could cut the trace from B28 and connect it to B29 swapping the signals.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I can't remember exactly how this works... When you use byte mode writes the 68K puts the byte on both D15..8 and D7..0 so to handle writes you'd would only need to swap the write strobes, but I don't *think* it'll work for reads. For it to work the 68K would need pullups on the data bus, it'd AND D15..8 and D7..0 into a single 8-bit byte, then maybe replicate that byte back into a word. This is all horribly undocumented... Even if that works, if a game decides to do word access it will fail. The only sure way to swap even/odd addresses would be to swap the /UDSW to /LDSW (big endian typo in my last post), and swap D7..0 to D15..8. The easiest way to find out whether you actually need to do this is to look at the game's Sega header.

<br />Maybe his donor expects the game to write where ever, I forget where, to enable SRAM and not ROM to appear at $200000 and up first? As opposed to the original board that might always enable SRAM when that area is attempted to be accessed.

<br />Thing that really pisses me off is there are members of this very site that actively sell reproductions of this game and know damn well exactly how to make it work. Some of them are people who even ask others on this site for help figuring out various hardware troubles but when it comes time that anyone asks about info they could share they stay silent hoping they can keep peddling "the warez" and god forbbid someone else would openly share the info so people that want could make the games themselves VS paying out the ass for a repro from them.
<br />
<br /> No worries, I have a japanese copy on the way to disect and trust me I'm gonna spread the info like the plague as soon as I know exactly how
<br />this works.

The only obscure configuration could be that the game is on a 24/32M board which has logic to swap ROM and RAM (and lock the RAM), but that board wasn't developed yet when this game was released. The lock logic would be apparent because it uses a 74'74 flip flop.

<br />Yes it is a sega released game and on a 1st party board (obviously). So your sure there is nothing different about it?

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Positive... It uses the standard decoding for &lt;= 16M games. From the scan I see it uses /LDSW (odd addresses) which IIRC is the most typical configuration as well. Also as to be expected you can see the game has 8 KiB/64 kilobits of SRAM too. There is absolutely nothing special about this cart.

<br />
<br />You are correct! Mottzilla is the winner! He found the solution. The game is now saving perfectly with the modifications he made. If anyone is looking for the BIN just shoot me a PM and I will be glad to share. I have it sitting here and ready to burn to a 27c160 for your Colossal pleasure!
