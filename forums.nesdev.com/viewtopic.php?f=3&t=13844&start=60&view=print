The bug is that whenever I try to exit the emulator in full screen with a rom loaded I get a “Mesen (beta) is not responding” error. As for my request, I would like to be able to select the screen resolution will in full screen mode. Right now if I am correct full screen mode uses whatever resolution the desktop is set to. If also I could open the emulator and go straight into full screen mode without having to select every time that would great as well.

Are you using a CRT? Or do you have a very slow video card that can't upscale in hardware?

For whatever reason the hardware upscaling on my Nvidia card is bugged and when I set it to upscale it only upscales to 4K at 30p instead of my TV’s native 4k at 60p. Besides, sending a signal in a display’s native resolution should always produce better image results than upscaling.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Then why not just run the emulator in 3840x2160 and tell the emulator to enlarge the video by a factor of 9?<br /><br />Or are you trying to say that your video card is incapable of outputting 3840x2160 at 60 fps? I know 3840x2160 resolution on HDMI 1.x tops at out 30 fps. Is the issue that your video card doesn't support HDMI 2? Does the mouse cursor lag when you run 3840x2160 on your desktop?<br /><br />&quot;Besides, sending a signal in a display’s native resolution should always produce better image results than upscaling.&quot;<br /><br />But you're asking to add a feature to send a signal at a resolution <em>other</em> than the display's native resolution.

I can't really see why fullscreen mode would cause this kind of crash.<br />There are a few debug switches you can use on Mesen (/novideo, /noaudio, /noinput) that disable each corresponding feature, could you try if running with all or some of these prevent the crash when exiting?  This would help me get a general idea of where the bug might be.<br /><br />As far starting in fullscreen mode, this is already supported :)<br />Just use the /fullscreen command line option and Mesen will start in fullscreen mode.
