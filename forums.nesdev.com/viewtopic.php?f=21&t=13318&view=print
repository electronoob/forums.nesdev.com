		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />First off, I want to say, &quot;Hi&quot; to everyone being that I am new here <img src="./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /><br /><br />So what am I doing here? For the past years I've been working on nothing but High Res Pixel art for MUGEN. Ignoring the hell out of Low Res sprites, but the pass recent months (while helping two of my friends) I started to work on Low Res sprites. The Lowest of them all with super limitations... NES SPRITING! Ha-ha I would be lying if I didn't want to smash my keyboard for how limited your space and colors are  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" alt=":(" title="Sad" /> <br /><br />So for doing things like this:<br /><br /><img src="http://i958.photobucket.com/albums/ae70/fjamesfernandez/Mel_Masters_Project/walking6_zpsa50923d2.gif" alt="Image" /><br /><br />To NES Graphics, its stabbing my brain out <img src="./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /> I give nothing but respect and praise to though who can workout the limitations the right way. So here I am trying to do the same thing. Lets just hope it goes the right way.<br /><br />Now, since I've been helping those two, I went back to continue writing my story that I had stopped the process a few years back... Well more than a few  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_eek.gif" alt=":shock:" title="Shocked" /> and decided to make an RPG out of it for none other than the NES! Mind you though, I have very little knowledge on what can and can not be done on the NES and I didn't want to bother the other two with my 101 questions. I am a pixel artist, not a coder. But I want to design with the mind set of a coder because I think it is very important for a pixel artist and a coder to be on the same page.<br /><br />Right now I just want to get the graphic design part down and worry about the rest later but I would still like to know if certain things can be done. I was hesitant to show the first opening world/stage that I've been working on for the past week... or was it two? Ha-ha <br /><br />I had to update and tweak things a few times before getting it right and have no palette issues &gt;&lt; I felt like exploding after words &gt;&lt; Everything here was done from scratch other than researching tiles and what not to do and things to avoid. All I have every sprited was characters. This is my first time doing environments/stages.<br /><br /><a href="http://i958.photobucket.com/albums/ae70/fjamesfernandez/Nes%20Project/Dev-1-FJF_zpszwpn7bxn.gif" class="postlink">&lt;Training 1 by myself FJF&gt; <img src="./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /></a><br /><br />One of my questions I had was, is it possible for the NES have a time cycle? Or should it just be triggered in an event?<br /><br /><a href="http://i958.photobucket.com/albums/ae70/fjamesfernandez/Nes%20Project/Dev-2-FJF_zpsltyfejfe.gif" class="postlink">&lt;Environment Time Cycles&gt;</a><br /><br />As I am designing I always ask myself if certain things can be done but not being a coder or fully understanding the limitations and no one to turn to this is where you guys come in <img src="./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /> I don't want to post up progress after progress, but I will when I have certain ideas that I am not sure if the NES can handle it. I just dont want to design stuff and then having to scrap it. Its a waste of time lol<br /><br />In Mugen all you do is sprite/animate and the rest is up to the coder. As a spriter you dont need to worry about much other than keeping your animations together with the palette and not worry about much of any limitations.<br /><br />Thank you for taking the time on reading this post and I hope you guys and gals like what you see. Thoughts and comments are welcome as always.

Anyway, any computer that can do games can simulate the passage of time. It's just a matter of incrementing a counter at a fixed interval. Then, when the counter reaches specific values it can trigger events, like palette changes/animations or anything else, really. What you can't do is have time pass while the console is off. For that you'd need a clock (and a battery to keep it running) in the cartridge that could be read by the program. Some Pokemon games on the GBC had that. It's possible to create a cartridge like that for the NES, but AFAIK, it hasn't been done yet.<br /><br />BTW, the sprites are looking good so far. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />

A friend of mine took his time to explain it to me. It took me a little to understand all of it. You basically have 4 palette groups. Pal(1) - Pal(2) - Pal(3) - Pal(4) That's 16 colors with transparency included. So you only have three colors in each palette. One of my palettes is strictly for my Hub the other 3 is for my environments. The character sprites aren't included.<br /><br />Reason why I asked was because one, its your classic random battle so there wont be any visual  monsters running around (still a thought) but I did wanted to include certain mobs that you can see at specific times in the game.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">keep in mind that you only have access to 256 8x8 background tiles at one time.</div><br /><br />Hmmm... yes the gif you saw was 256x240 if that's what you meant.

I was worry of two things. (1) that if a person is camping for a mob in a stage that you couldn't make the cycle go through unless you zoned out and came back.

The PPU has access to 256 unique ones for background and 256 unique ones for sprites, at any given time.<br /><br />Technically, you could have more than 256 on screen...by swapping ROM banks mid-frame, but very few NES games do this.<br /><br />The same for Sprite colors, technically you can layer sprites on top of each other, so you could have a sprite that uses 6 colors (2 sprites on top of each other). But, the NES is very limited with sprites, so use this only sparingly. It is more common to have a character constructed out of sprites that use different palettes...like head one palette, shirt one palette, pants a third palette.

While yes, NES graphics are tiled, it doesn't necessarily need to look quite like that.<br /><br />Check out some of surt's work: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://pixeljoint.com/pixelart/96743.htm">http://pixeljoint.com/pixelart/96743.htm</a><!-- m --><br />Or ptoing's: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://pixeljoint.com/pixelart/80652.htm">http://pixeljoint.com/pixelart/80652.htm</a><!-- m --> (Sorta breaks some rules, but still good reference.)<br />And then there's this for a darker, late game style: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://imgur.com/a/kUrra">http://imgur.com/a/kUrra</a><!-- m --><br /><br />I only mention this because your non NES art is good, and your NES art is very, very basic. People starting out with tiled graphics tend to draw inside the grid. Instead, try drawing stuff regularly (with color limitation in mind) and edit it to fit the grid later for a more organic look.

I just enlarged the gif so you guys can see it clearly.</div><br /><br />That's the proper resolution but that's not what I was talking about. You've got 32 x 30 tiles on your background, so that's a total of 960 background tiles that are displayed on the screen at one time. (I suppose to be pedantic you could say it's possible to have more than that showing if some are half scrolled in.)<br /><br />What I was saying is that the background tiles that are being drawn all have to come from a maximum table of 256 tiles. You may already know this, and I don't think your images have a problem with this, I'm just pointing it out in case you didn't know.<br /><br />The NES will be able to access a total of 512 8pixel x 8pixel graphic tiles at one time. (These can be switched in and out with mappers, but there will still always be a total of 512 at a time) Half of the tiles are for sprites and half are for backgrounds, hence 256 tiles for backgrounds. So, that makes it difficult to do something like a full image for the background without repeating. It CAN be done (like in Smash TV) but it's advanced.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">Love your pixel art animations too.</div><br />Thank you! The ones you saw on here are most likely older ones that I've replaced. I just started with this a couple months ago and I'm still learning. It's been several years since I've drawn much to be honest. I used to do screen printing.<br /><br />I looked down through your Mugen animations. Your stuff is really good. I like the girl with the suit and Katana. You shouldn't have much trouble getting into this. One thing I do is make little rules for my drawings to keep things for consistent. Like, I never draw an outline pixel on a corner, except for special exceptions when I'm trying to define an object that's not thick enough to have color. Or like, I never have my arms progress in a diagonal line without an adjacent horizontal or vertical pixel. I don't know if that made sense, but the point is that I find it helps a lot to have my own set of rules to make design consistent. There's a lot less to work with with lower pixel resolution as I'm sure you've noticed.<br /><br />And if you're drawing a curve, always be mindful of the length of your &quot;steps&quot;. Like, don't have a step that's three pixels and then one that's two and then one that's three. You probably won't have any problem with this. Your drawing skills are a bit above mine. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">that if a person is camping for a mob in a stage that you couldn't make the cycle go through unless you zoned out and came back.</div><br />I'm not sure if I understand this. Obviously the NES has limits, but you have a lot of freedom to program your time to cycle however you want it. I haven't heard anything about how you'd want this to happen that would be impossible for the NES.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">If only way to cycle was that the nes would had to do like a loading screen</div><br />Games like Simon's Quest tend to make people think this is true, but it's not the case. AVGN even pointed out that it wasn't necessary to do so in Simon's Quest because FT13 didn't.<br /><br />What has to happen is that you have to go into an NMI. This happens once every 60th of a second, I believe. So, it's not hard to make this happen in real time. You just can't make it happen at the point in your logic that the program realizes this needs to happen. Let me try to explain that better. You get to a point in your game logic where your time counter triggers a palette change. Since you're not in NMI at that very millisecond, you set a flag that you program can check in NMI to know to do the palette change at the proper time.

You can only have 256 UNIQUE 8x8 pixel areas in your level.<br /><br />This may help.

(There are exceptions, but forget about those until you understand the concept better.) When a new area is loaded, this new area can use a different set of 256 unique tiles. This is how different stages of Mega Man have different looks.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"> Rule is you cant have more than 8 sprites on the same horizon (Scan line) any more than that will cause the &quot;Flicker effect&quot;.</div><br />A bit pedantic, but having more than 8 sprites per scanline doesn't cause flicker. It causes additional sprites to simply not be drawn. Flickering is the programmer's response to this, so that <em>different</em> sprites end up not being drawn. If the programmer did nothing, one object might end up entirely hidden, instead of it only being hidden on certain frames. The hardware does not flicker sprites automatically.

The reason why I got so stuck on grids was because I was trying to avoid using too many colors on things.
