toku is right, and I'm mistaken. Wolfenstein-3D uses ray casting. Doom, on the other hand:<div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"><br />The Doom engine renders the walls as it traverses the BSP tree, drawing subsectors by order of distance from the camera (that is, the closest segs are drawn first). As the segs are drawn, they are stored in a linked list. This is used to clip other segs rendered later on, reducing overdraw. The list is also used later to clip the edges of sprites. ...<br />Once the engine reaches a solid (one-sided) wall at a particular X coordinate, no more lines need to be drawn at that area. As this occurs, the engine builds up a &quot;map&quot; of areas of the screen where solid walls have been reached. This allows distant parts of the level, currently invisible to the player, to be clipped completely.<br /></div>http://doom.wikia.com/wiki/Doom_rendering_engine<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=4328">pops</a> — Wed Apr 08, 2015 4:53 am</p><hr />

Ray casting is a variant of ray tracing. Ray tracing requires that you trace a ray from the camera viewpoint to the level geometry for each pixel in the viewport. This is computationally expensive (640x480 = ~300k rays!). However, if we constrain the camera viewpoint so it is unable to rotate about the z-axis, and we constrain the level geometry so all walls are at 90-degree angles to flat surfaces (floors, ceilings, etc), then we need only cast one ray for each pixel in the x-dimension of the viewport. For a viewport of 640x480, this is a 480x reduction in rays cast.<br /><br />It's easier to explain in motion, and I couldn't hope to explain it better than this website: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://fabiensanglard.net/doomIphone/doomClassicRenderer.php">http://fabiensanglard.net/doomIphone/do ... nderer.php</a><!-- m --><p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=4328">pops</a> — Tue Apr 07, 2015 8:15 pm</p><hr />

Certainly, you can 'emulate' tile-and-sprite-based systems using 3D hardware (as noted above, the 3DS doesn't include the GBA/DS tile-mapped hardware, so a recreation of a NES game on 3DS/2DS hardware would require some kind of graphics emulation). And a game rendered in 3D can still include only 2D mechanics and thus be considered 2D ('Splosion Man). But of course, a game rendered using only 2D functionality can include elements of depth both in graphics and mechanics (in retrospect, mode7 seems to have been meant for this kind of game!). Space Harrier for the Sega Master System, and 3-D World Runner for the NES certainly seem 3D enough to me.<br /><br />I consider any computer without 3D transformation/projection hardware capabilities to be 2D. Of course, Doom and Quake run just fine on computers like I've just described. So really, it's a matter of personal preference as to what makes a '2D system'.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=4328">pops</a> — Tue Apr 07, 2015 10:28 am</p><hr />
