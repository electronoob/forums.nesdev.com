		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I disassembled my Wii yesterday.
<br />Couldn't get the damn thing back together. This is one compact system.
<br />I bought a new Wii today but, does anyone have a link to some teardown guides? This has got to be the most complex assembly I have ever torn down. 
<br />
<br />Also, more damage before that was caused by the update that poisoned 'Mad World'. Which rendered  most of my games. (At least the Sega ones) unplayable.
<br />So I guess it's semi bricked.
<br />
<br />If I do manage to repair the thing, I guess I'll keep one for homebrew and the other as a Wii. That oughta work.  
<br />
<br />Edit: maybe this post should be a blog but, It contained questions I need answered so I'll post it here. Capieche?
<br />I hope that's okay.
<br />
<br />Edit2: Anyway. I also would like to mention I got it together somewhat. But for some reason the disc drive doesn't work. Maybe I put the power it backwards? @.@. I really hate the optical drive. 
<br />
<br />Another thing I'm curious about. Why does the Wii have so little memory? (yeah I don't like to say RAM these days when it's not random but is Burst. [Why not BAM?] LOL.  ) And why does it seem that many product use Samsung memory? (The Wii, Acer, Microsoft Xbox 360) Is that 'cause it's more affordable?
<br />Now I'll just shut my fingers and quit rambling. Sorry.

<br />- Iyee... After all the recent activity, I dunno. You're correct: no need to get a blog! <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Doesn't team Twiizers have a key to unbrick the Wii?
<br />
<br />If I can get the mechanisms all worked out I'll have two Wii's.
<br />One for modding and one for Playing Wii titles that I don't have to worry about updates with.
<br />
<br />I really Liked the Wii homebrew. Had some pretty decent emulators and software.
<br />
<br />
<br />Hmm, I just remembered I had an extended warranty w/ wal-mart. I should get it back together and try to return it. The warranty seals seem pretty easy to reproduce. But if I do that I'll get me an updated Wii. Although that crappy Mad world game updated the IOS anyway. So crap.
