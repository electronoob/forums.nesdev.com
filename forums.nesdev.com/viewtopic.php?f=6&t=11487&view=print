While I'm impressed with how closely you matched the GB's sawtooth (can the VRC6 even do it?), I really wanted to hear how the Pokemon music would sound with a triangle wave instead.  I really love the NES' TriWave sound, I don't know why.  Listen to Dark Lord's soundtrack and you might see why I like the sound.

And the beginning of Raining Blood, would be cool if more was done with that.</div><br /><br />Haha, I'm definitely a noob when it comes to Atari POKEY, but I was pretty happy how it turned, even though it's not really that complex. I'm planning on doing the whole Raining Blood song in the future, I just feel like that simple square waves won't cut it. I'm thinking of replacing VRC6 with N163, but I'm not sure. <br />Who knows? Maybe I'll also do something about Iron Maiden <img src="./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" /><br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">OneCrudeDude wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">I just got done listening to your Palet Town cover.

I really love the NES' TriWave sound, I don't know why.  Listen to Dark Lord's soundtrack and you might see why I like the sound.</div><br /><br />Uhm... Well... the thing is that the sawtooth that Pokémon uses is very soft (kinda like something between a sawtooth and a triangle wave) compared to the 8-step sawtooth that VRC6 uses, which sounds a bit... gritty? Idk if that's the right word. I personally haven't even thought about that, maybe I should give it a try. <br /><br />When it comes to making songs in 2A03, I guess it would be interesting. However, songs like Lavender Town and Pokémon Tower will not work simply because the waveform is way too distorted.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Give it a whirl, I'd like to see what it'd be like.  Maybe you could take advantage of how the triangle wave isn't exactly in-tune like the other instruments for Lavender town, and maybe use some of the lower octaves or the mid-upper pitches.
