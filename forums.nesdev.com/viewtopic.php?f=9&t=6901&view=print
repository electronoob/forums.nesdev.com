<br />I wrote up some basic code to try to turn the noise channel on, but so far no luck:

<br />
<br />I have pin 2 of the 2A03 connected to a 386 op amp with a 20x gain, any higher than that and I pick up more buzz than actual sound. My 2A03 is connected as such:
<br />Pin 2 -&gt; 386 -&gt; speaker
<br />/RST toggled by my AVR
<br />A0-A2 -&gt; 74HCT138
<br />GND is grounded
<br />D0-D7 -&gt; bank of 3 x 74HCT245's
<br />CLK, using the original NES crystal with one of the unused 74HCT04 gates, as such: <a href="http://go.mibbit.com/thumb.php?x=32&amp;y=32&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.mpdigest.com%2Fissue%2FArticles%2F2008%2FMar%2FCrystek%2Ffig1.jpg" class="postlink">http://go.mibbit.com/thumb.php?x=32&amp;y=32&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.mpdigest.com%2Fissue%2FArticles%2F2008%2FMar%2FCrystek%2Ffig1.jpg</a> (This is probably an issue, but I couldn't find any circuit other than this which reliably uses a &gt;10Mhz crystal)
<br />Pin 30 is grounded
<br />/NMI and /IRQ are pulled high
<br />R/W going into the '138 and the gate
<br />+5VCC coming from a clean switch mode PSU, with additional filtering caps
<br />
<br />Most likely causes that it won't work:
<br />Crystal circuit
<br />Initialization of the CPU doesn't work
<br />If statements are too slow, interrupts occur quicker than state function can iterate
<br />Something about the actual audio out fromt he 2A03
<br />
<br />Could anyone look over the code and offer some advice? I've commented most of it to make it easy to follow.

<br />
<br />If I were trying to debug this, I'd use the simplest possible code that showed me that it was working. I'd just have it write 1 to $4016, then look at the strobe output. If it was high, I'd then run it again but have it write a 0. If it was now low, I'd conclude that it was properly executing, then proceed to the APU stuff.

<br />$400C - 0x3F       //Set volume to max
<br />
<br />$401F - 0xAA       //JMP out of bounds
<br />
<br />Sorry if this isn't usually the way you guys show routines. The first value is the address, and the second is the data being written to that value. My code simply waits for the NES to tell the microcontroller that it is BRKing, giving me 16CLK to write those values into the appropriate registers on my uC. So, when the NES BRKs the first time, address 4015 has 0F written to it, then the next time it BRKs, 400E has 0x85 written to it, and so on and so forth. The other code is for debug LEDs.
<br />
<br />Is there a simpler way to just get noise? You mentioned something about writing to the counter?
<br />
<br />I checked the famicom mod thread, but it doesn't seem to make the NES provide the sound; it seems that the cartridge itself has an additional sound chip, which gets mixed into the NES sounds.

<br />Years and years ago when I made my first devcart for the SNES, my first test that it was working was to enable interlaced video, a single bit in a register. When I saw the TV go from progressive to interlace, I was overjoyed.

<br />
<br />I consider it the 'key on' command.  It sort-of is that I guess, because when you use volume envelopes, writing to $4003/$4007/$400F is what triggers it.
<br />
<br />If you write to it once that's enough, IIRC the value to use was %00001xxx (0x08).  But after that's initialized, any write to $4002/$4006/$400E will work by itself.

It allows basic control of frequency, volume, and timbre of the four wave channels, without having to deal with the envelope, length counter, linear counter, or sweep.

<br />
<br />The example set of instructions you posted are pretty complicated for an initial bring up test, despite looking simple. You're trying to get audio out when you don't know:
<br />1) If the processor is booting
<br />2) If your oscillator circuit is working and stable
<br />3) If the interface to the 2A03 works properly (I can vouch for that circuit, but there could always be a wiring mistake in practice)
<br />4) If the timing of the Arduino is valid
<br />5) If the audio output circuit is working how it should
<br />
<br />I wouldn't try multiple instructions until you know that one instruction at a time works successfully. If you believe the chip is coming up properly (are you holding reset asserted while power comes up? you should), the simplest audio communication test is just write to $4011 and check the output voltage on the triangle/noise/dmc pin of the chip. That's what I was doing here: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://skrasoft.com/blog/?p=183">http://skrasoft.com/blog/?p=183</a><!-- m -->
<br />If you write alternating FF 00 FF 00 you'll get a square wave.
<br />
<br />If you have any doubts about the clock circuit you are using, you should be able to get a 20 MHz oscillator from an electronics store. The 2A03 won't mind the slower speed. The thumbnail you posted is microscopic on my screen, so I can't read it to comment on it. You can probably make a Pierce oscillator with the crystal you have: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierce_oscillator">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierce_oscillator</a><!-- m --> 20pf is probably a good place to start with the capacitors. 
<br />
<br />Your comments about the audio output connection don't mention the necessary 100 ohm pull down resistor on the audio output pin (each audio output pin gets one). Don't leave that out.
