In fact, most GBA games look like they could be easily made on the SNES. One thing I noticed is that a lot of GBA games actually do use 3 or 4 BGs, but one of them is usually used for something that could have easily have been made with sprites, like a status bar that uses 16 8x8 tiles or a vertical pole that is 16 pixels wide. (I don't think I've ever seen a GBA game even use more than 80 sprites, leaving plenty for a status bar.)

I don't know all the GBA games out there of course, but I'd say the only GBA game I've seen that does a moderately well job technically is Gunstar Super Heroes. I would have loved to see something like Gunforce 2 on that system, (off course I would  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt=":roll:" title="Rolling Eyes" /> ) as I doubt the GBA can't handle something like that. I thing I always find funny is how people say that the GBA hardware is comparable to the SNES, if not, slightly better when its really a substantial leap. (Almost about as big as Master System to Genesis?)

I actually found that game surprisingly well made, and I'll take the golfing minigame &quot;Party Game&quot; over the one on the Gamecube anyday. What I probably been more specific about is how many 2d games (modes 1-3 I think?) actually are as good as the specs would suggest. Although SMB on the GBA was good and there'd be no way to have that game being 2d, I think that the 2d titles on the GBA look much better than the 3d ones, because 1. from what I understand, 2d is in general much less processor intensive than 3d and 2. The GBA did not have any hardware support for 3d unlike the DS, making it one of the most powerful solely 2d systems I've seen.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />So, are we talking &quot;pushed&quot; as in dropping frames or taking crazy shortcuts to achieve what they did, or &quot;pushed&quot; as in they broke boundaries that few other games managed to achieve? Or both?<br /><br />I can't say I recall any GBA games of mine where I noticed frame dropping, but my eyes are terrible judges of frame per second to begin with. I will say that when V Rally 3 came out, I knew it was king. That game not only handled non-bland environments, it even added elevation to its courses. Most racers I'd seen up until that point where flat, level tracks, and jumping only possible via F-Zero / Super Mario Kart like physics (if you could jump at all). They even added a 1st-person driver's view. I don't think any other GBA racer had that before them (or after, I dunno).<br /><br />I played the Ecks vs. Sever games. They're pretty fun as far as simple FPS games go, and had a lot of levels with multiple routes and various guns. The environments and enemies were somewhat bland, but the whole experience was smooth on the GBA.<br /><br />As for what games actually are doing a lot under the hood, you'd probably have to pop open an emulator with a debugger and look at how many DMAs are going on, how many CPUSets and CPUFastSets it's called, and track CPU usage (no$gba is perfect for all of the above). But generally, with the GBA, developers were pretty spoiled. Coming from the GBC, I sometimes still have a hard time imagining myself running out of cycles unless I try to do something ridiculous. If you catch a game using Halts or VBlankIntrWait BIOS calls though, it's usually just sitting on its hands in that case, meaning its not doing anything particularly important at that moment, so not a good candidate for a game &quot;pushing&quot; the limits.<br /><br />If I had to guess, I'd definitely put some of shitfaced clown's GBA demos up there as well for pushing the GBA.

I remember seeing quite a lot of GBA games that fit your description, way back in my old Nintendo Power issues. I think they were being cautious or didn't know what they could do. You see that a lot with games early on in system's lifetime. There were a number of games on the GBA that made me feel like I was playing a portable SNES, however. I remember Rayman Advance for being one of the earlier titles to exploit the GBA's massive color palettes, and F-Zero: Maximum Velocity showed the system was capable of emulating Mode 7-like graphics. Then there was Golden Sun, which speaks for itself.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">Espozo wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">The only reasonable thing I think they could have done to improve the GBA is to have all the sprites participate in rotation and scaling or at least scaling.

The only thing is that there are only 32 distinct &quot;groups&quot; of scaling parameters that apply to the sprites.  So I guess you meant to say that every of the 128 OAM entries should have its own scaling/rotation parameter instead of sharing it with the other sprites in its &quot;group&quot;. As far as I know, the DS has the same scaling/rotation limitation for its 2D engines.

There isn't <em>that</em> much you can do with mode 7-like effects (especially when you only get two simultaneously) and while rotating/scaling sprites helps, there's a limit to that too, and if you push clever techniques in the video hardware you usually aren't pushing the CPU then ;P<br /><br />Anyway, for a good example of a 3D game:<br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=hWBUdgIa0oE#t=32">https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=p ...

Does they game even update vram or are all the tiles for all the animations stored even when there not needed?)

The SNES has only 1x overdraw, and some games such as Secret of Mana and Seiken Densetsu 3 often have sprites that disappears as they break the limit. I bet many GBA games would have this problem if ported on the SNES.<br /><br />The SNES can only have 2 16 colour BG and 1 4 colour BG at best. I know a lot of GBA games that relies on 3 or more 4 colour BG. But however, the GBA BGs lacks the priority bit of the SNES, which also makes them less powerful.
