		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Hey all, my favorite Famiclone the Famulator went kaput recently but I'd like to reuse its Famiclone controllers on the NES by replacing the DB-9 cord with an NES 7pin cord. The problem is that I have no idea how to go about getting it to actually work.
<br />
<br />Does anyone here happen to know where I may possibly find Famicom DB-9 controller pinouts? 
<br />
<br />Looking around, time and again I find the common dendy one, like the one shown on the right of this image 
<br /><img src="http://img375.imageshack.us/img375/1286/nesfamiclonepinout.png" alt="Image" />
<br />
<br />
<br />The problem is that the Famulator does NOT use this pinout. I've hacked apart the DB-9 cord to try and learn its secrets, and this is what I discovered.
<br />
<br />Rather than look like this: 
<br />
<br />    __________
<br />1 \ x o o o x / 5
<br />   \ o x o x /
<br />    6 `"""' 9
<br />
<br />it instead looks like this: 
<br />
<br />    __________
<br />1 \ x o o o x / 5
<br />   \ o x x o /
<br />    6 `"""' 9
<br />
<br />
<br />the signals are for this pinout the top middle three and the bottom outer two.
<br />
<br />Because I hacked apart the controller edge, I know what color wires each pin corresponds to
<br />
<br />x ORG YEL RED x
<br />BLK x   x BRN
<br />
<br />but even knowing all this still doesn't yield any results. Soldering an NES cord to each of the five wires and then plugging it in to my nes and running the nintendo joypad test via the powerpak yeilds no results, so I know for certain that the pinout for the dandy Famiclones is not correct. I've tried many different sequences and they all come out as bad. 
<br />
<br />
<br />So i need help finding a pinout that will work. If it'll help, I'll gladly post a pic of the controller PCB, though as its a gloptop I'm not sure how much help that would be. 
<br />
<br />I'm sure I had read something about Famiclone pinouts on the nesdev wiki in the past
<br />all I can find is the tutorial that I wrote myself

<br />
<br />Any help is greatly appreciated.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />thanks, but neither help. Its DB-9. I know the NES 7pin pinout and the DB-15 pinout. That's not what I need to know. I need to know the pinout of this unusual DB-9 Famiclone controller.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Why would you want to use it? It's a controller right? I doubt it works differently than that. If it has 9 pins and uses them odds are you'll either have to use the DB-15 or hook it up to your EXP port along with the controller port.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Do you have a multi meter?  I assume you don't have an oscope, if you did it would make it easy.  Also does the controller have a glob top or an actual IC chip?  I assume glob top, but if not you could just figure it out from the shift register pin out.
<br />
<br />You could use a multimeter to figure things out, most all wires should have ~0Vdc between them.  When you find +3-5 Vdc the red test lead should be on Vcc.  No guarantee the black lead is on ground though.
<br />
<br />If you find Vcc and ground then you've only got 9 combinations on the other 3 signals to solve which one is which.  Just don't get Ground confused with one of the data signals though.  Once you get Vcc and Gnd figured out you could use a original NES controller and hook up some test wires to keep trying configurations until you find it.  What ever you do don't connect a controller with Vcc and Ground reversed.  Not much of an issue if you get Gnd confused with one of the 3 signals but it won't work obviously.
