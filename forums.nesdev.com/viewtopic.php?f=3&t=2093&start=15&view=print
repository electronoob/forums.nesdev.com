<br />
<br />cpuclock -&gt; ppu-&gt; cpuclock_H -&gt; ppu-&gt; cpuclock_L -&gt; ppu
<br />
<br />Well, instead of a function that "renders" 3 ppu pixels, I need to rebuilt it in order to allow a single PPU cycle/access.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I don't think you need any finger granularity than one CPU cycle for 6502 emulation. Each 6502 cycle always accesses memory, either a read or write. I'd be very surprised if this access were done at a different time each cycle; I expect that they always occur at the same relative time. One difference I would not be surprised to find is that writes effectively occur earlier in a cycle than a read, since the written data appears immediately while the data read isn't latched until later, to give time for the device to respond. A device which responded quickly to writes and which did not latch data being read (i.e. during a read the data lines could change if the data being read changed) could cause such a situation of differing write/read times.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />OK, I was upset about this last test ROM. -_-;; Plus, I'm sorry for possible English faults below...
<br />
<br />Basically, <strong>all</strong> previous test ROMs have passed. I had made huge fixes into my pAPU/CPU core, plus a huge debug session in order to understand why a specific test ROM was failing. Each cycle or CPU event was matching, so I was happy.
<br />
<br />What my CPU instruction core does is something very "simple": the PPU runs 3 cycles for each memory access. What I meant was to "break" these 3 PPU cycles into single cycles, after the "new" info about low/high edges of a clock... -_-;; 
<br />
<br />I couldn't debug this new test ROM yet due to the lack of motivation because of complexity level reached, so I'm not making any updates until I get proper help some day.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />i dont think you need to do half ppu cycles.  i was thinking about this a while ago when getting those test to pass.  the only thing i changed was the catch up.   reads would catch up to the cycle, while writes would catch up to the cycle + 1 ppu cycle.  this would be because the read would set the read line and hold it for the cpu read.   the write would be held for the cpu write, and the ppu would get it after that.  but this is really a guess and i have nothing to  show that it is correct.

<br />
<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">LDA #00 &#91;3 cycles&#93;<br /><br />1. opcode fetch &#40;1 CPU cycle -&gt; 3 PPU clocks&#41;<br />2. immediate byte &#40;+1 CPU cycle -&gt; +3 PPU clocks&#41;<br />3. A = read from RAM&#91;00&#93; &#40;+1 CPU cycle -&gt; +3 PPU clocks&#41;<br /><br />What I see as &quot;correct&quot; follows:<br /><br />3.&nbsp; A = read from RAM&#91;00&#93; &#40;+1 CPU cycle -&gt; +3 PPU clocks&#41;<br />- put 00 on databus &#40;ppu clock&#41; -- rising edge<br />- temp = read from RAM&#91;00&#93; &#40;ppu clock&#41;<br />- A = temp &#40;ppu clock&#41; -- falling edge</div>
<br />
<br />Example: opcode $01 fails (ORA). If I take out the CPU cycle (or 3 PPU cycles), it passes ok. This is where my question relies.
<br />
<br />Another interesting issue (or "hack") is for fetching the bytes after the opcode (immediate=1 or absolute=2): when fetching the opcode, the PPU is clocked <strong>before</strong> checking the NMI condition (to trigger after completing the instruction); when fetching the immediate byte, the NMI is checked <strong>after</strong> checking the NMI condition. Bump.
