<br />
<br />For example, I'm having trouble extending my single fread of a 32K bank of ROM, into a mapper-conscious loading function...

<br />
<br />The iNES header will tell you how many PRG and CHR banks exist and you just load the data into memory. Most mappers are very simple to handle. Only a few get a bit more complicated. 
<br />
<br />But it sounds like you're trying to make a NES emulator and just don't know what to do, which is fine, but you need to ask questions or be more specific about what you don't understand.

Also, I have no idea where to start on PPU or APU emulation. Console programs are my main specialty.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />What is so hard about it? You have a counter that determines how many bits have been written into the shift register. When it overflows (all 5bits written) you write to the internal register associated with the address written to. And if anytime the reset bit is written to, you reset your counter. 
<br />
<br />What is more confusing about MMC1 is there are some games that use MMC1 in odd configurations like SXROM where CHR registers are repurposed for having more than 256K of PRG-ROM and/or more than 8K of PRG-RAM. MMC6 is kind of annoying too since only 2 games use it and it doesn't behave like the MMC3 exactly but as far as iNES mapper numbers are concerned it should.

Also if you need to ask such simple questions this early in the development process, it's unlikely you'll ever be able to finish your emulator. Making a multi emulator system doesn't sound like a realistic goal either given your progress so far.

<br />
<br />Important to add that Ryphecha (the author) writes her own cores as well, and thus has experience with fixing the cores she imports. Just slapping a bunch of other emulators into one GUI is interesting, but it's been done to death already as well.
<br />
<br />I really have to agree with Zepper and thefox. If the NES is difficult, then emulating other systems (other than perhaps the Chip8) is only going to get worse.
<br />
<br /><em>However</em>, the NES is a great place to start learning. Keep at it for 5-10 years and who knows what you can create.

<br />
<br />It also is one of the most fun to emulate due to the library of many great games.
