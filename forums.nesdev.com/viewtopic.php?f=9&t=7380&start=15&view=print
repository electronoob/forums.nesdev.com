<br />
<br />No it's definitely off the chip itself - that's at least what the video shows. Sound is likely going to be changed because that hex inverter must be doing something there. But beyond that, the audio path juts has some resistors and things on it so it's not terribly complex (or something that can't be duplicated if all else fails).
<br />
<br />Re: Turn of TV: I didn't have a TV plugged in while it was on battery power. Same problem with the buzz when using the standard audio out. I could try a laptop, though - I have an Audio4 DJ I use for, well, DJing, that might work so I could use a laptop for that (it's a fantastic USB audio box, by the way, in terms of sound quality - not so great for super low latency recording but it's great for Traktor). I think the PPU theory is probably what's going on there.
<br />
<br />Thanks for the help everyone! This is going to be a bit involved I suspect so I'll report back once I have tried a few things <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />

<br />
<br />To overcome it you will want to take the sound from CPU, mix it together, amp it a bit (you will have to bypass the CMOS inverter chip which is normally used for amping) and presto. I need to build a NES to FC adaptor and do some photos and recordings...

How does that amplify things? <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />
<br />
<br />I was wondering if it might be helping to correct any DC offset but I didn't see anything like that in my tests when going off the chip directly. To be fair, I wasn't totally looking for that, either.
<br />
<br />The link WhatULive4 is almost perfect. I don't really have to do much of any work there <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /> But I really wanted an audio out for the PowerPak too. I suppose I can just do that on my own by adding a simple resistor and cap but it's nice to have an all in one package. I am going to contact the developer to see what options they might be able to offer there as well.
<br />
<br />Otherwise, yeah, I will build something on my own depending on how much doing the screen blank trick works for the PPU. I decided I don't want to lift any pins off of it on this NES (it's my only one right now) just yet so if that doesn't cut noise down enough, jumping off the chip sounds like the best bet (and is probably a good idea anyway).

<br />Ah ok. I was able to get sort of an idea of how that works from what you said and Wikipedia. I don't suppose you might have any links or docs to share that might better explain what's going on there? Sounds like I was, more or less, right though.
<br />
<br />It seems like it's probably not needed or really should not be involved at all if I wanted to make my own output? I thought the output from the pins was actually pretty good and not in need of much amplification. That was using a mixer before going into my computer though - I haven't tried recording directly in yet. Seems like I did not have to really bump up the volume on the mixer though.
<br />
<br />I'm guessing if I wanted to amplify it I can use similar designs, say, from the MidiBox stuff and from the CMoy amplifier? It would be nice if I could cram all that into the NES case but I'm not sure that is totally ideal <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /> I may just wire up what I need for RCA outs and put the rest on a break-out board or something.
<br />
<br />That is if I didn't want to buy the kit mentioned above. I e-mailed the LSDJ folks to see if they had suggestions on the cart-out so we'll see how that goes. Going to wait on making any hardware until I figure that out. And I still need to try the screen blanking trick <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />*slaps forehead* I keep forgetting about that simulator <img src="./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" /> That thing is super useful, thanks for the reminder! The MidiBox folks also mentioned it so shame on me for not using it as a good resource.
<br />
<br />In playing with the sim, I saw about 2x as well, though I am a bit confused as to why the first 2 resistors are there? They squeeze the output (in the sim) down to mV and then it gets amplified again? I assume it has to do with mixing of the two audio pins? For me, I was going to grab the audio from each pin separately anyway.
<br />
<br />Either way, it seems like instead of a hex inverter I could just do amplification using some specs from the <a href="http://tangentsoft.net/audio/cmoy-tutorial/" class="postlink">Cmoy</a> or copy the output specs for the MidiBox SID project and probably be ok? Since I am not going to be mixing, I need 3x of everything to grab all the audio (2 pins of the 2A03 plus cart in) but that's not a big deal to me really.
<br />
<br />Doing some filtering might not be a bad idea. It would be nice to approximate the sound of the NES (other than the noise) before I go to record it. But I adjust the EQ and things anyway when mastering so it is not as much of a deal. To me, I did not hear much different between the NES audio path versus the CPU pins in terms of filtering but didn't really spend a lot of time listening to it either (I was mostly just looking for noise).
<br />
<br />The biggest issue is making sure I protect the chip from damage when wiring my own solution. Second goal is to eliminate buzzy noise and the third is to, after that, make it as true to the original sound as possible.
<br />
<br />Thanks again for all the help everyone! I have visited these forums for a few years now and have been able to get some amazing information! It is nice to see everyone being so helpful to a newbie poster! <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />

IIRC, the pins there are pull-up-only DACs and the resistors are cheap "current sources", so there's some <a href="http://wiki.nesdev.com/w/index.php/APU_Mixer" class="postlink">nonlinearity</a> there. The use of resistors two orders of magnitude larger is probably to allow them to pretend no current goes through them in comparison to the 100 ohm pull-down.<div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">Either way, it seems like instead of a hex inverter I could just do amplification using some specs from the <a href="http://tangentsoft.net/audio/cmoy-tutorial/" class="postlink">Cmoy</a> or copy the output specs for the MidiBox SID project and probably be ok?

You probably could just use the right opamp (single-sided rail-to-rail?) and be done with it.  Depending on what you're plugging into and what your input impedence is, you might even just use protection diodes and a current limiting resistor on the pins and directly hook those into your sampler.<div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">Doing some filtering might not be a bad idea.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />The cart in is mostly for the PowerPak though if it sounds a lot better I could use the same mod for my Castlevania 3 (JP) cart. The reason I wanted to record the PowerPak is that, even though the PowerPak does not use the original chips, it seems to do a better job of emulating them than FamiTracker.
<br />
<br />I suspect it's all in my head or the result of the lower 8-bit output of the NES or something like that. FamiTracker sounds too clean and not as dynamic as the PowerPak.
<br />
<br />As far as mastering, I tapped the pins directly I think last week and, yeah, it sounded pretty good. I read online that using an electrolytic helps add protection but I'm not sure if a diode is better or not, or how that works to be honest <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /> I do know that pin 1 at least sounded as clean as silk. pin 2 was more noisy (slight buzz) but not bad.
<br />
<br />So yes, the goal is really to protect the chip and provide clean audio. If the levels are not quite right that's fine as long as, individually, the audio is correct. I can (and have to) balance the audio when I go to master it anyway. The filtering caps I don't mind if I could get them close to what the NES filters are doing.
<br />
<br />The thought had crossed my mind to buy two of those audio amp kits mentioned earlier - one would be for the 2A03 and one for the single cart out. Expensive but if they work well, probably easier to do since I have other hardware projects on my plate as well <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />

I noticed the MB-SID output (available <a href="http://ucapps.de/mbhp/mbhp_sid_v3.pdf" class="postlink">here</a>) uses an electrolytic but also has a few smaller ceramic caps. That output pipeline uses a transistor (I guess similar to the original NES there) which I am guessing is some sort of op-amp type of thing?

Went to Wikipedia and didn't find much I actually understood about what's going on :)</div> By having two diodes there, one from ground, one to +5v, we guarantee that a voltage that is too high or too low can go somewhere rather than through the NES CPU itself. The idea is "+large volts goes through resistor, through diode, to +5V; -large volts goes through resistor, through other diode, to 0V". Also "resistor guarantees that shorting out output doesn't damage NES CPU either."<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">The electrolytic cap was mentioned on one of the PowerPak mod sites. I can try to go hunt it down if need be. I noticed the MB-SID output (available <a href="http://ucapps.de/mbhp/mbhp_sid_v3.pdf" class="postlink">here</a>) uses an electrolytic but also has a few smaller ceramic caps. That output pipeline uses a transistor (I guess similar to the original NES there) which I am guessing is some sort of op-amp type of thing?</div> For the SID audio stage there, the 10uF capacitor C5 and 1uF capacitor C6 are DC blockers so that the sampler and SID get a 0VDC-centered signal. But they're not protecting anything.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">Super-Hampster wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">You can't pass audio through a diode. It's a rectifier and only allows DC current to flow. And since audio signals consist of an AC current with varying frequency A diode only allows current to flow in one direction. So since AC requires the ability to flow in both directions you would get no audio output.</div> One, you're assuming a circuit topology different than I specified above — I never wanted the audio to go through the diodes. Two, audio can flow through a diode — how do you think a crystal radio works? The audio signal out of the NES has both a DC and AC component, it's not centered on 0VDC; while -3V doesn't** flow through a diode, both 1V and 5V flow through a diode, and a signal that's 3V+2V*sin(t) will pass just fine. (And probably come out looking like 2V+2V*sin(t))<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">Super-Hampster wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">To test that I just tried it. It didn't work. Touched the wire minus the diode to the NES sound output and heard NSF playing on powerpak. Put diode in between in either direction and no audio.</div> Of course that didn't work, the diode wasn't forward biased.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">Diodes proved to be impossible way to keep the channels separate because they wouldn't pass the audio.</div> But a bunch of sufficiently large resistors should have worked fine.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">I haven't tried it straight from the CPU however. I've only tried it from the audio out pin.</div> Yes, looking at the audio path the DC component is removed by the NES audio filter — that's the point of the 10uF capacitor in the image I posted at the top. This won't work on the white jack out the back. Two, putting a diode in <em>series</em> likely won't work even out of the NES CPU itself, because most diodes have a minimum forward voltage of 0.6V and the NES audio is probably less than that.
