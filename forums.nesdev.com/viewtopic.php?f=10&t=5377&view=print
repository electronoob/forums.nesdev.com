<br />
<br />I want to be able to load soundwaves into an NES with a flash cart.
<br />
<br />I am such a newb, I have absolutely no idea how to do it, but I know it can be done.
<br />
<br />MIDInes has custom waves, I would like to be able to do the same thing.
<br />
<br />Any help would be wonderful.  I am truly a super newb, so be easy on me!
<br />
<br />Thanks,

<br />Thanks, for the quick reply.
<br />
<br />I'm afraid I have alot to learn?
<br />
<br />Is it relativly easy to put soundfiles onto a cart and trigger them in some sort of way?

Or do you want the musical score to trigger them?

<br />Wow, Thanks!!!
<br />
<br />That is exactly what I was looking for.
<br />
<br />If I bough a PowerPak and loaded the NSF files onto it, would I then be able to play my songs on a NES?

They're the same thing as games only...just music, nuffin else.  At least, that's my impression at this point. i'm still *relatively* new to NES =)

It pretty much needs some special hardware (special mapper) and some kind of overhead program to keep it all running.

A NSF player has to know what parts of the code to execute, and emulators have to now how to map the contents of NES images. It's the same thing. Yeah, I'd say NSFs are just the original games stripped from everything that's not related to sound and converted to a particular mapper (there is a standard mapper for NSFs, right?).

<br />And I was just saying that NES ROMs are the same thing. You can't just "run" them if you don't know the mapper, the PRG and CHR sizes, mirroring, and all that stuff in the header. This means that NSFs aren't any less "runnable" than NES ROMs.

<br />Playing the same NSF in various emulators makes it clear that its not just what's in the NSF file that is what is running inside the emulator.  The info formatting by Jnes is completely different than that of Nestopia or FCEUXD, for example.  The only way that can happen is if the emulator has a built-in NSF 'kickstart'.
<br />
<br />I'm trying to figure out NSFs myself too...from what I can tell:
<br />
<br />1. The player can be an emulator or a music-player plugin or anything that can produce sound as an output.
<br />2. The player must contain a runnable 6502 emulation with sound if it doesn't natively contain one such as an NES emulator would.
<br />3. The player must interpret the NSF file and load the data portion into the emulation's high memory and set up the mapper's registers according to the NSF's header.
<br />4. The player must call the NSF's init routine once.
<br />5. The player must periodically call the NSF's play routine.
<br />
<br />a. The NSF must contain a code chunk that sets up the 6502 emulation engine.
<br />b. The NSF must contain a code chunk that interprets the song data and does stuff to $4000-$4017 whenever necessary whenever it is called (ie. plays the song).
<br />
<br />So in a NSF-capable emulator it would seem that the code that runs the NSF is built in to the emulator as a separate chunk of RAM that is only sent to the 6502 emulation engine when an NSF is being emulated.  It is this code that does steps 4 and 5.  The emulator's UI would do step 3.  If the emulator is capable of producing sounds based on writes to $4000-$4017 then the music should be heard.
<br />
<br />Questions:
<br />1. What mapper do NSFs use?
<br />2. Where in the emulator's memory space is the built-in kickstart code typically placed?  WRAM?  $200-$7FF?  
<br />3. When you talk about loading an NSF into a PowerPak are you really loading just an NSF file into it or are you loading a NES ROM that has been coded to play the NSF (ie. you've packaged the built-in piece and the NSF together into a runnable ROM?)
<br />4. Am I way out in space with my interpretation/understanding?  
<br />
<br />I tried running a NSF in FCEUXD SP 1.07 and looking into the debugger but it doesn't show anything loaded.
