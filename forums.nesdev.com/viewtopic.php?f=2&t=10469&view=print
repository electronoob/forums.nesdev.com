		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Hello,<br /><br />Recently, I got into NES programming. After working through a general book about 6502 Assembly, I did the Nerdy Nights tutorial. Then, I converted my custom sample program to CC65 with the help of the website <a href="https://bitbucket.org/ddribin/nerdy-nights/src" class="postlink">https://bitbucket.org/ddribin/nerdy-nights/src</a>.<br />I did that because I'm planning to do my first game in C with the whole NES-specific low-level stuff written in Assembly and the general game logic written in C. So, I will need to write everything in CC65 syntax.<br /><br />But of course, some questions came up. And I want to ask the first few in this thread. It would be great if you could help me with them.<br /><br /><br />1.<br />I've read that CC65 can be a hassle to set up while NESASM is quite easy to start because it doesn't require a cfg file and putting together the header.<br />But in the examples, the CC65 code doesn't look any more complicated than the NESASM code.<br /><br />In NESASM, we have<div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">&nbsp; .inesprg 1<br />&nbsp; .ineschr 1<br />&nbsp; .inesmap 0<br />&nbsp; .inesmir 1</div><br />In CC65, we have:<div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">.segment &quot;HEADER&quot;<br /><br />&nbsp; .byte &quot;NES&quot;, $1A<br />&nbsp; .byte 2<br />&nbsp; .byte 1<br />&nbsp; .byte $01, $00</div><br />Doesn't look <em>that</em> much more complicated to me. So, in which situation does CC65 become complicated to set up?<br /><br /><br />2.<br />What's the deal with the &quot;nes.cfg&quot; file?<br /><br />The guy from that CC65 example site said:<div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">Here's the nes.cfg as shipping with cc65 version 2.13.0.</div>and then showed a source code.<br />But I neither found an &quot;nes.cfg&quot; in &quot;cc65-win32-2.13.3-1.zip&quot;, nor in &quot;cc65-nes-2.13.3-1.zip&quot;. (O.k., it's version 2.13.3 instead of 2.13.0, but I didn't find 2.13.0 to check it.)<br /><br />And when I compile my code with<div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">cl65 -t nes -L cc65\lib -o test test.asm</div>it doesn't ask for such a file. So, what do I need it for?<br /><br />By the way, why is there a file called &quot;neschar.inc&quot; in the folder &quot;06-backgrounds2&quot; on that site? This doesn't seem to be used either.<br /><br /><br />3.<br />My first game shall look like one of those first generation games. You know, like &quot;Donkey Kong&quot;. (I don't mean that I want to re-program a specific one of those games, I just want my game to have the same technical limitations.) So, I would for example expect my nes file to be 24592 bytes long.<br />That's the case when I compile with NESASM. But with CC65, it's 40976 bytes.<br /><br />I assume that's because the NESASM code (see above) declares<div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">&nbsp; .ineschr 1</div>while the CC65 code declares 2 x 16KB PRG:<div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">&nbsp; .byte 2</div>However, when I replace the 2 with a 1, the NES program doesn't work anymore and only shows a gray screen.<br /><br />What do I have to do to tell CC65 that my game shall have the same header data as games like &quot;Donkey Kong&quot;?<br />I guess this is where the &quot;nes.cfg&quot; comes into play somehow, right? But I'm still a bit confused since the CC65 zip files don't include one and I'm not sure if the one from that site is identical to the one that the current version of CC65 would use by default.<br />(The basis for my sample code was the background2 example from week 6 from Nerdy Nights. The CC65 version can be found on the website that I linked above.)

I already got a bit more insight. I will read all the stuff (one of the links even includes the manual for cfg files) and then see if I can edit and condense my configuration file accordingly.<br />By the way, the default &quot;nes.cfg&quot; was in the CC65 source code download package. That's why I didn't find it at first because I downloaded the binaries.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">rainwarrior wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">This is my generic iNES header snippet for CA65:</div><br />Content-wise, that's actually identical to the one from the tutorial. Only that the other one uses vertical mirroring. But I switched it to horizontal now because &quot;Donkey Kong&quot;, &quot;Mario Bros.&quot;, &quot;Pac-Man&quot; etc. have it too.<br />By the way, if a game does not scroll, is there even any difference between horizontal and vertical mirroring?<br />And do you know of any (real, licensed) non-scrolling game that switches between the two name tables during gameplay?<br /><br />P.S.: You can leave the last eight zeroes (the padding bytes) out. In the config file, there is the option<div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">fill = yes</div>anyway.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I was thinking more of a game where one level consists of two rooms or whatever that the player can switch between through a door and each room is represented by one nametable.<br />After all, since the NES has two nametables available anyway even in the most basic games, I wonder if that was ever used somehow in a non-scrolling way. Wouldn't this have been a good method to double the size of a level in a plain first generation game without having to use any advanced techniques and without having to reload the background graphics?

(Where you see the house in a miniature format where you can go in again.)<br /><br />Besides, does it take long to build up a completely new background from scratch? Imagine I have a game with a bunch of rooms, all looking different. The player can go through, let's say four doors. And in the next room, he can go through several doors again. So, you can never know in advance which room he will take. Whenever the scene changes, you have to put new graphics into the PPU. How long would this take? Would there be some kind of delay in the gameplay or can the switch be done within the time of one frame where everything else is also processed?

At most, you can upload the sprites and about 230 bytes per vertical sync, so that'll take at least 5 frames (or 1/12th of a second) if you don't turn off the display. That's pretty small, and can be done without really changing anything else.<br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">Would there be some kind of delay in the gameplay or can the switch be done within the time of one frame where everything else is also processed?<br /></div>It's probably not actually kind to suddenly change everything without the player getting a chance to react; a small delay may actually be kinder than immediate page flips. If you turn the screen off entirely, you can definitely draw everything in 1/60th of a second, but then the player will see a (usually) black flicker, which may be annoying.<br /><div class="quotetitle">DRW wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">So, you can never know in advance which room he will take.<br /></div>To speed things up, you actually can start drawing off-screen as the player approaches one of the exits. Since you only need to know 5 frames before you change the view, you probably actually already know if the player is going out one of the doors.

I won't start developing an actual game until I understand every single line in my sample code. So, yes, I might actually use an IDE as soon as I start a real project. But in the moment, a text editor and the assembler is all that I need. I don't want anything to be abstracted away from me now. (Well, except for the actual conversion of assembly code to binary code of course.)
