		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Thanks so much for sharing your song, this is EXTREMELY helpful to me for making ggsound the best it can be for others to use.<br /><br />First, I was able to successfully convert your song without error from ft_txt_to_asm.py by going into Edit -&gt; Clean up -&gt; Remove Unused Instruments. I will add a note to the README.txt advising users to do this before converting.<br /><br />The only error you made 8bitmicroguy, with regards to how I have documented GGSound's features was:<br />-You need to duplicate your usage of B00, B01 etc. in all channels, in unique patterns at the very end of your song or you'll get incorrect looping. I may improve this in the future but that's how it works right now.<br /><br />The issues I found in GGSound to play your song were:<br />-Parentheses in names in FamiTracker became symbols the assembler has trouble with. I will add a feature to the converter to sanitize all labels so you don't have to worry about renaming anything in your FamiTracker compositions.<br /><br />-One of the channels incorrectly set itself up for looping.<br /><br />Once I fix up the converter to sanitize names for you and fix the looping bug, I'll update the distro again. I'll also re-upload your song with the minor changes that were necessary to make it work.

I've only ever tested with my own compositions, so there are bound to be some more bugs to weed out.<br /><br />If I had to guess though, ggsound really only supports a single instrument having DPCM samples associated with it. If you have more than one, the behavior is undefined, as stated in the readme.<br /><br />Secondly, I hope edit ...clean up...remove unused instruments will fix that up (I don't know if this affects deleted DPCM sample slots...). If not, I'd like to take a look at your ftm. Thanks!<br /><br /><strong>Upon further thought, I bet the only problem is that your song is still trying to play a note which had been associated with the sample that you deleted. This is an assumption I made,  so it just dies in this case. Perhaps I can try to add some easier to understand errors to guide the user. I'll update Wednesday.</strong>

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />8bitmicroguy, dpcm sample indexing was done incorrectly in ft_txt_to_asm.py. You can now remove an unused sample from anywhere in the list and it'll work. If you remove a sample that is indeed mapped somewhere, you'll get a nice error describing the octave, semitone and sample index (in FT) that was missing. OP updated with latest version. Let me know if it works out for you! Thanks once again for exercising this tool, you're helping me make this better for anybody who comes along and uses it.  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" />
