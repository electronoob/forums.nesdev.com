		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I'm not sure if the Gamecube really qualifies as &quot;retro&quot; - but hey, it <em>was</em> released the same year as the Gameboy Advance.<br /><br />In any case, I recently got an SD Media Launcher so that I can run my own code on the Gamecube, so I decided to write something. And what better to write than a chiptune player? <img src="./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" /><br /><br />Here's the result:<br /><br /><img src="http://jiggawatt.org/badc0de/other/gwmp-1.png" alt="Image" /><br /><br />Download <a href="http://jiggawatt.org/badc0de/mic-gwmp-1.zip" class="postlink">the DOL file</a> if you want to run it on your own Gamecube (it also works quite well in Dolphin).<br />Or watch <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jxxJ49Pc5M" class="postlink">a YouTube video</a> captured from my PAL Gamecube.<br /><br />All the emulation code (6510, SID, YM2149) is my own. Audio is generated at 44.1 kHz mono and output using libasnd.<br /><br />The UI is done in just about the least efficient way possible: I keep an offscreen 24-bit RGB buffer in RAM that I draw into. I then convert this buffer to the native framebuffer format (YUV 4:2:2) for every frame. It works well enough for what I needed, though.

I'd say it's getting to be retro or considered so. <br /><br />I've thought about writing GameCube homebrew before, but I never looked into what tools and what if any libraries were available. I'm guessing SDL might have been ported? Though I prefer Allegro.

I don't know if Allegro is available. The only thing I can find when I do a web search is a bunch of polish-language pages <img src="./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" /><br /><br />devkitPro includes a bunch of examples for various areas (graphics, audio, accessing SD cards, etc), so I just took one of the example projects and started adding my own stuff to it. Then it was as simple as running &quot;make&quot; and opening the resulting DOL in Dolphin.<br />I'm not sure what kind of debugging support there is, though. Dolphin appears to be geared more towards gaming. The Gamecube does at least seem to have some kind of memory protection enabled, because I managed to trigger some sort of exception handler early on during development that threw up a register dump on screen out of pure digust with what my program was doing.

I suppose you could run a whole game off the SD card, loading whatever you needed into RAM as needed.

I think I've done it using the homebrew channel netboot, too, but it's been long enough that I'm not certain.<br /><br />Downside, I guess, is that you have to use the gamecube controller to control it.

The only thing I'm unsure of right now is whether it's possible to write straight into the framebuffer on the Wii, or if I'll need to change how I display the GUI.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Nintendo introduced the &quot;Wii Family Edition&quot;, the first Wii revision outside Korea not to include GameCube support, in the fourth quarter of 2011. This means the first five years of used Wii consoles have GameCube support. The second Wii without GameCube support is the Wii mini, but that doesn't have an SD slot anyway so there's no way I can think of to run homebrew on it.
