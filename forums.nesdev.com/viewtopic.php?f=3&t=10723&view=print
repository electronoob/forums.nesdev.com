		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Hey, I discovered something interesting and I'd like to discuss it. I haven't tested any of this, so let me know if I'm completely utterly wrong. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" /><br /><br />Bandlimited synthesis produces something called the Gibbs Phenomenon. Basically, each transition is surrounded by a bunch of oscillations that get bigger and bigger until the actual transition, and then they get smaller and smaller. This adds a high-pitched &quot;ringing&quot; around every transition, which ends up exaggerating the treble of the sound, making it sound tinny. Most of you probably don't care, but if you're a programmer, there's a good reason to care:<br /><br />The most common way I've seen to implement bandlimited transitions (called BLEPs for some reason) is to have a circular buffer, and then have a 2-dimensional table of BLEPs at various different offsets. Whenever a transition needs to occur, you paste the appropriate BLEP into the circular buffer.<br /><br />The BLEP table (and the subsequent circular buffer) needs to be somewhat big because the oscillations take a while to stabilize to a point where they're too small to represent, and you need to represent all of them until that point.<br /><br />If you were to somehow reduce the Gibbs phenomenon, not only would you bring the shape of the transition closer to its ideal shape (a square wave), you also reduce the oscillating artifact that you need the big tables for.<br /><br />The method I've discovered for attenuating the Gibbs phenomenon is called sigma approximation.<br /><br />The common way to generate a square wave via its harmonics is like this:<br />Let N be the number of odd harmonics you want<br />For n = 1 to N<br />Let P = (2n - 1)<br />output += sin(P * x) / P<br /><br /><br />Using sigma approximation (which I don't actually know how to do, I just looked this up), you can produce a Gibbs-attenuated version of this square wave, like this:<br />N, n, and P are the same as before.<br />Let Q = (PI / (2*N))<br />output += <span style="color: #FF0000">(</span><span style="color: #FF8800">(sin(P*Q)/(P*Q))</span> * sin(P * x)<span style="color: #FF0000">)</span> / P<br />(Stuff is highlighted so it's less like a jungle of parentheses)<br /><br />This produces a square wave, but the oscillations that surround each transition are <em>greatly</em> reduced, and stabilize much more quickly.<br /><br />If you compare the two methods, the Gibbs-attenuated version <em>neither adds nor subtracts harmonics</em>, it only adjusts the amplitude of the existing ones. That means that the Gibbs-attenuated square wave is <em>still bandlimited</em>, even though it looks slightly different, so no aliasing. In addition, the reduction in those oscillations means they stabilize much more quickly, so you can use a much smaller buffer and a smaller table. Finally, the lack of Gibbs means the sound itself no longer has the ringing artifacts that surround each transition, and the waveform looks much closer to what the ideal output would be.<br /><br />So why doesn't anyone use this? Is it completely wrong?

If the frequencies goes to infinity, a sharp edge is a sharp edge. But because you are limited in frequency, the gibbs phenomenon appears. It doesn't increase any frequencies, it just removes the highest ones, because you can't go to infinity.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />BLEP stands for Band-Limited stEP function, as a pulse wave consists of the sum of two Heaviside step functions per cycle.<br /><br />Resampling on the Super NES and PlayStation doesn't show Gibbs overshoot because the 128 band-limited impulses stored in the DSP's ROM are all-positive, having had their treble mostly cut out with a Gaussian filter. Games are supposed to pre-emphasize samples' high frequencies to compensate; the Super NES has caught a lot of flak for sounding muffled compared to the Genesis because a lot of games don't have this pre-emphasis. This sigma approximation (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sigma_approximation" class="postlink">as described on Wikipedia</a>) is just a more rigorous way to design a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transfer_function" class="postlink">transfer function</a> (EQ curve) that cuts out these high frequencies than the ad-hoc method used in the Super NES and PlayStation, whose methodology <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/viewtopic.php?f=12&amp;t=10586" class="postlink">nocash is trying to figure out</a>.<br /><br />Another EQ curve commonly used to decrease overshoot is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raised-cosine_filter" class="postlink">raised-cosine filter</a>. It allows tweaking the center and width of the transition band to gently ease out the highs that cause ringing.<br /><br />Finally, there's a variant of cubic interpolation that completely eliminates overshoot by tweaking the normals at each sample point. But this <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monotone_cubic_interpolation" class="postlink">monotone cubic interpolation</a> can't especially be used with the BLEP method because each sample's normal depends nonlinearly on the samples around it, and it looks like it leaves some frequencies above Fs/2 in the signal.

Bandlimited synthesis doesn't actually <em>create</em> the Gibbs phenomenon, it just &quot;reveals&quot; it.<br /><br />The Gibbs phenomenon doesn't go away when you add more harmonics, it just gets more squished. The overshooting is still there though, even when you're at infinite harmonics; it just is squished infinitesimally. I guess that's as good as it not being there at all. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" /><br /><br />Either way, I think my point still stands that attenuating the Gibbs phenomenon, no matter how you do it, is still desirable for the reasons I mentioned in my original explanation.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Yes, Gibbs' is about an unexpected perception and illusion based on our expectation that a square wave have square edges. I've reduced it in the past (for other reasons, particularly to allow full modulation without clipping, as the overshoot is significant) by reducing the high frequencies a bit, as most devices do anyway. In blip_buf I've gotten it to almost nothing.<br /><br />But, I don't think that this means that you can use a narrower window and still get the same attenuation of aliasing; I think it just reduces the in-band high-frequency content slightly (especially at Nyquist), but leaves the more subtle &quot;alias-canceling&quot; ripples at the same amplitude and thus needing the same width of window to maintain attenuation. Someone please chime in with more theory or actual tests demonstrating this.

This means that the blip_buf method (taking the derivative of a signal and then convolving with a BLEP while decimating) should produce exactly the same result as convolving with a filtered impulse response and decimating, barring roundoff error. The only way to reduce ringing is to reduce the negative portion of the time-domain impulse response. And the way to do that is to widen the transition between pass and stop bands.<br /><br />blargg: I can eyeball it as soon as I can figure out what a &quot;div&quot; means. Is it the big squares or the little tick marks?
