But I've got a sinking feeling even my games are trying to nudge me into being a good little spendaholic consumer these days.<br /><br />Take SSB4 for example. I finally* managed to actually play the game this month, and one thing that stands out is the trophies. All of the Super Smash Bros. games award you trophies as random drops, and SSB4 does too... but mostly, you get gold. Which you use to buy trophies. In a shop. Complete with a nice 3D rendering of shelves with little price tags and neat boxes with fake advertising logos splashed onto them. Don't even get me started on the <em>real</em> advertising in the game! Buy the DLC! Buy an amiibo! It even nags you with a &quot;do you want to receive ads&quot; popup every time you start the game!<br /><br />It's not just SSB4 either. Hyrule Warriors has a Flash banner on the main menu. And the entirety of Breath of the Wild's gameplay revolves around buying things. Want armor? Show me the rupees! Out of arrows? Be prepared to do some legwork, 'cause nobody ever has more than 15 in stock at a time! But don't worry, half the NPCs in the game are now shopkeepers, so you'll always find someone within easy walking distance! Guaranteed to be 50% more fun than mowing the lawn!<br /><br />I came here to kick ass and chew gum. But now the gum is $9 per pack and my boots only last twenty kicks before I need to buy new ones.<br /><br />I'm going to go check out Lizard.<br /><br /><span style="font-size: 50%; line-height: normal">*after a full year of downloading, more than a hundred bucks in bandwidth fees, and two days of &quot;installing&quot;, AKA &quot;you don't have enough space to install this, but we're not going to tell you how much you need and you can't change the install device without re-downloading all 13 GB, so you'll have to sit there copying everything else off onto a USB stick, which takes hours and has an 80% chance of failing for no reason whatsoever, so you really will need to sit there and press 'retry' every two hours, no you can't play games while you're doing this why would you even think that AND GUESS WHAT NOW YOU HAVE TO DO IT ALL AGAIN FOR THE MANDATORY DAY ONE PATCH HAHAHAHAHA I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU THOUGHT WE WERE ACTUALLY COMPETENT&quot; but that's another rant entirely.</span>

Maybe you're playing it wrong?  I haven't played it myself, but I've seen a bunch of videos, and it doesn't seem like rupees are even as important as gil in a classic Final Fantasy game.  The whole theme is living off the land.<br /><br />Either way, it seems to me that a game in which your character buys stuff with in-game currency is not quite the same thing as a game in which you yourself buy stuff with actual real-life money.  I think there's a meaningful distinction to be made there.

But a lot of the good stuff is found; not bought.<br /><br /><br />Arrow farming, early:<br />-find a couple of bow riders.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I'm a big fan of functional economy in video games, but there's a very strict separation between one that supports the natural progression of the game, and one that's included merely to pad out the experience of the game (which is what I'm guessing the thread is touching on).<br /><br />One really great example I think is the classic Dragon Quest formula, where every time you are able to make it to a new town, you'll find stores that sell better items than the previous one, but for a bit more money, so you'll have to fight enemies to build up enough funds to invest in those, allowing you to sell your old equipment in the process for more money, and the process repeats until you are close to the end of the game. If you focus on a strong party which relies a lot on equipment you'll have underpowered characters until you build up an economy to get their gear up to par.<br /><br />Despite the games being very grind-heavy, I find this to be a very fun mechanic that keeps me engaged, unlike the more &quot;modern&quot; grinding approach that we see in stuff like MMOs, but now also infecting every other genre. I can't really point out exactly what makes the difference between &quot;the good example&quot; and the one that I find disgusting, but I guess it's a subtle idea of realising when the economy suits the design of the game, and when it is added simply to fake some kind of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compulsion_loop" class="postlink">constant, miniscule progression that essentially adds nothing to the game</a>.<br />I have never played the <strong>Monster Hunter</strong> games, but I feel like they are based entirely around this concept. Do they fall into the former or the latter category though?

The first thing i did was get to each of the towers, and it caused the difficulty curve to be a bit rollercoaster-like.<br /><br />For what it's worth, i still buy arrows from time to time, i'm just not as dependent on the stores for resupplying.<br /><br />I think that you &quot;ought&quot; to have the master sword by then,  (never breaks, gets recharged instead), different sets of armour for different conditions, and also be able to craft armour, weapons and arrows from the ancient junk you scavenge from rusted guardians and the smaller sentries (AND the larger guardians - but it is basically futile to do this before you can craft those ancient anti-guardian arrows).<br /><br />Crafting gear still costs rupees beside crafting materials. I think that was kind of unnecessary.<br /><br />You also ought to have a good stack of protective potions against elemental damage. I don't particulary like this, but it is what it is. Basically, ranged vs ranged combat is clunky and disorienting, so it often comes down to a &quot;drink a potion to guarantee a win&quot;, which is tedious micromanagement.

Sure, the game has a ton of shops, but I don't recall ever using one. It's similar in just about every other Zelda game, too. You buy the rings in Zelda 1, and otherwise the only stuff I've bought is &quot;collectibles&quot; like heart pieces. Even Link's Awakening allows you to steal the stuff you need.<br /><br />As for progression, the only real structure after the intro plateau is beat all four &quot;divine beasts&quot; and get the master sword, all of which can be done in any order you want, and then head to the castle. Or you could just head straight to the castle whenever you feel like it. I'm not a fan of modern open world games, but I do love an open ended structure such as this.

You can't buy the good stuff outright, you have to gather materials for the smith to forge new gear with. You still need money as well, but by the time you've taken enough hunts for the RNG to give you all the rare drops you need you're pretty much guaranteed to be swimming in it.<br /><br />You can gather or craft nearly all of the consumables, too, which is very convenient. Really, the only 'bad' grindiness in the game is getting the right random drops. That and you need to bring your A game on every single hunt, which can get exhausting if you're not up to it, but I imagine that's what keeps the diehard fans hooked.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">FrankenGraphics wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">I think that you &quot;ought&quot; to have the master sword by then,  (never breaks, gets recharged instead), different sets of armour for different conditions, and also be able to craft armour, weapons and arrows from the ancient junk you scavenge from rusted guardians and the smaller sentries</div><br />How many hearts do you need for the MS? I spent most of my orbs doubling my stamina gauge so I could climb/glide around enemies instead of dying to my awful reflexes all the time.<br /><br />I've been to Robbie's, but I can't find enough gears to craft any of the armor. I've got enough of everything else, bar rupees, to forge the entire set, but the RNG seems to hate Ancient Gears.

It's boring and fiddly and no fun at all, but the only other option is to charge in, get mobbed and die.<br /><br />Unless it's fire/ice and I use the opposing type of arrow, which I tend to do even at point-blank because I don't <em>need</em> to aim and it only costs one arrow instead of twenty.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">Sumez wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">The only thing I ever used rupees for in BotW was opening the faery ponds and getting gear (in particular, one for enduring the cold, and one for enduring the heat on death mountain - the rest is pure vanity).</div><br />What about Hylian plate?

Regular enemies can knock six hearts off in one hit and take enough damage to break weapons as fast as you find them. Guardians can soak up an entire inventory of normal weaponry without dying and one-shot you regardless of what you're wearing. In any other game I'd say I'm grossly underlevelled, but the closest equivalent is buying better gear and you just said you didn't do that...<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">I have no idea what you'd even spend the money on in BotW?!

Scavenge every dead guardian you see, and do a lot of dungeons. <br /><br />You can one-shot guardians with the anti-guardian (not the real name) arrows you can craft at the tech lab. Also found in some chests.<br /><br /><br />Else, this game is just a lot about anticipating moves and not getting hit. i'm not too good at it, but feel that's key.

I can't think of any in the game that can't be avoided completely. And with the exception of an incredibly well timed shield parry, they are practically impossible to kill without the Master Sword, and super easy with it (yeah you can use ancient arrows, but they are rare). As long as you are only fighting one at a time, their lasers are easy to dodge. As for fighting multiple at a time... that's just something you should never do.<br /><br />Lynels is another thing you shouldn't try fighting until pretty late in the game, but apart from that most things aren't really too dangerous, and fully healing food items are super easy to stock up on.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">In any other game I'd say I'm grossly underlevelled, but the closest equivalent is buying better gear and you just said you didn't do that...<br /></div><br />I said I'm using the default blue shirt and upgrading that at the great faeries. It had by far the highest defense rating of anything in the game, and kept me well protected throughout the game. I agree, it really does sound like we are playing two different games. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />
