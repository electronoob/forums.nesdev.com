Although, I'm on a laptop and my handwriting is indistinguishable from hieroglyphs. I think it'd be fun to do.<br /><br />And as somebody who re-wrote their game 4 times for various reasons (engine updates for new sprites, efficiency rewrites, it just didn't work, etc.) the LONG time in between each one sucked, but it wasn't a deal breaker. I did do the final rewrite in about a month though...although I now am just getting back in to it again to add the final game mode, which is basically a second whole game to mine because I have the space.

My primary desire for a video series, is for guidance and motivation. If I were to attend a course on assembly language, my instructor would start of at the very basics, and step by step move into the more complexities of the language. Along the way he would have his students practice the concepts and dig deeper into his assigned reading material and exercises. I've noticed that many people have a strong desire to make their own NES game. It seems to me though that most  give up very quickly when they start finding out what's involved. many,  feel lost in the sea of information and even with the existing tutorials ,can't grasp the ideas very well. I think that if someone were to take on this task, and act as a sort of teacher, it would help many who have a strong desire to learn this seemingly obscure language .

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />If you're really interested in having more guidance I'd suggest following tutorials for assembly on a 8-bit microcontroller, something like an AVR.  If you learned the basics of writing programs in assembly with a good tutorial for AVR's you'd be able to easily transition to the 6502/NES by reterencing the instruction set and docs describing the architecture.<br /><br />Your AVR will be fairly easy to program compared to the NES, so once you grasp the concepts behind assembly you'll just have to learn to do more with less once you go to the NES.  Assembly is far from an 'obscure language' although I'd agree many people try to avoid it like the plague.  You might think there is a significant difference between an AVR and the NES but in regards to assembly as a language there are only subtle differences, namely things like the zero page which most people neglect in the beginning anyways...<br /><br />I can see why you wouldn't want to bother with an AVR if you really want to end up on the NES.  But if you require guidance to learn assembly doing something like that is the only option really.  You'll be waiting a LONG time for somebody to write the basics of assembly on the NES since the people who could do so don't see much point as you might gather from everyone's comments.  I'm not suggesting buying and AVR demo board or anything, just downloading AVR studio and follow the tutorials while running your programs through the debugger.  Only get to the point where you understand assembly.  At that point you'll probably see why we're saying a video isn't worth it, then dig into the NES documents and 6502 instruction set and start programming on the NES.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Honestly, having experience of dealing with 6502 and AVR assembly code in the same timeframe, I wouldn't say it is a good idea to start with AVR just to switch to 6502. That's because AVR, being a MCU, is way more complex and is very different in general (separate memory spaces, RISC architecture). Maybe it is just me.<br /><br />From my practical experience with ~9 different CPU types, I'm pretty confident that 6502 is the simplest and easiest one to learn, if you don't have prior knowledge of anything from 8080 family. Otherwise it could be very difficult to switch the thinking process.

Maybe it is just me.</div><br /><br />Yeah well my time delay between learning and writing AVR assembly and doing the same on the NES was about a year.  And in that year I spent a large amount of time learning the hardware of the NES thoroughly before attempting to write any 6502 assembly.  So I admit my advice could be a little skewed here.  But I still feel if you absolutely REQUIRE programing and assembly to be taught to you vice learning from documentation, then the route I suggest is probably your only option.  I wouldn't think the differences in complexity would be large enough to be an issue.  If you can pick up the necessary things with an AVR by being taught through a tutorial you'll be experienced enough to teach yourself the simplicities of the NES with documents alone.
