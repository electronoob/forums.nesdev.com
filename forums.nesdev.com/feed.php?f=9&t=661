Yes but what makes Flash preferable to an EPROM (assuming you're not currently developing the BIOS) or if you are developing still, NVRAM for ISP? Anyways my comment was directed towards storing GAMES on the flash, not the BIOS. My point is that flash is stupidly in vogue for copying systems with massive local memory (memory cards etc); why the hell have flashrom when in a second you can load a game into RAM? If you're going to be loading one game at a time (all that's really practical for NES copying) why the hell use flash? If you're like me and flip through games every few minutes, you'll be spending a rediculous amount of time flashing games, at least a minute for PRG then another for CHR. Also why the hell use flashrom when a single RAM can be your PRG ROM and WRAM or CHR ROM and CHR RAM *and* VRAM?<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=20">kyuusaku</a> — Thu Oct 20, 2005 10:50 am</p><hr />

My guess is that he want's a flashcart capable of playing back commercial ROMs. Due to only MMC5 using CHR data, I noted it was optional.  IMO MMC5 is over the top for a flashcart, it's silly to use a 3.3V 300K gate FPGA for a NES project that isn't an entire SOC design. It's also strange to me why anyone'd use flashrom at all with a dynamic FPGA &amp; memory card setup.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=20">kyuusaku</a> — Thu Oct 20, 2005 7:12 am</p><hr />

kyuusaku: You forgot controlling C data bus, as is done in exgrafix, and the NES side of the chip (CPU and PPU buses).<br /><br />For an MMC3 or FME7 class mapper (8 KB PRG banks, 1 KB CHR banks, variable mirroring) without expansion audio, you'll need at least the following 25 pins on the NES side: <ul><li>GND, +5V (2 pins) </li><li>CPU D0-7, A13, A14, /CE, M2, R/W, /IRQ (14 pins) </li><li>PPU A10-13, /R, /W (6 pins) </li><li>CIRAM A10, /R, /CE (3 pins) </li></ul>Run the other pins (mostly lower address lines and PPU data lines) as well as the CPU data lines straight through to the chips.<br /><br />Then 19 pins on the parts side:<br /><ul><li>PRG ROM A13-A18, /CE (7 pins) </li><li>WRAM /CE, /WE (2 pins) </li><li>CHR ROM A10-A18, /CE (10 pins) </li></ul><br />That makes a total of 44, which is (coincidentally?) the same number of pins as <a href="http://www.tripoint.org/kevtris/mappers/mmc3/" class="postlink">Kevin Horton's description of MMC3</a>.

Whoa, I guess I was overthinking it.  Controlling every single line to and from the PRG/CHR would be a bit excessive...

FLEX6000 FGPAs are $25-$35, looking on digikey.  They have about that many I/Os, on a 144-pin TQFP.  I've been looking at some MAX7000 CPLDs also.<br /><br />119 I/Os sounds like a lot, how'd you get that figure?  I know you can at least connect the PRG data bus all together, and I doubt the mapper logic would need to know every single address line (but I dunno what your design has in mind, heheh).<br /><br />With memory cards I think it would depend on what's in the particular SD card used, it's probably safe to say you'll need a 5V/3V transceiver.

I've been dreaming up a design for a flash cart, and I've come up with a few questions which might affect the cost or possibility of actually building it.<br /><br />My design currently has at its core a "magic box" which needs to be filled in with an actual component.  I have it handling all connections between the NES cart bus and the various onboard ROMs and RAMs.  If I added correctly, interfacing the cart bus with a 512KB PRG, 512KB CHR, and 8KB WRAM would require 119 (!!) I/O lines.<br /><br />On to the actual questions:<br /><br />1. Is there any kind of (cheap) programmable logic that loads its behavior from an external memory and has at least 119 I/O lines?<br /><br />Do I really need that many I/O lines?  Can I get away with multiplexing the buses somehow?  If I get a chip with that many pins, I'll have to learn how to solder surface-mount by hand, which I've heard can be a pain.<br /><br />2. Where can I find information on MMC/SD cards?  From my searching, it seems that SD cards should support the older (and more open) MMC standard, but I haven't been able to find any documentation on interfacing with an MMC card.<br /><br />3. Will I be able get my controller chip and the MMC/SD interface to work using only +5V and ground?<br /><br />4. Where online can I get a few custom boards made?  Is there any free PCB design software available?  How many layers might I need for all of those I/O lines?<br /><br />Thanks in advance to anyone who can help.  I have this vision for my flash cart, but I don't have the knowledge to build it yet.   <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_confused.gif" alt=":?" title="Confused" /><p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=13">abonetochew</a> — Sun Oct 16, 2005 3:21 pm</p><hr />
