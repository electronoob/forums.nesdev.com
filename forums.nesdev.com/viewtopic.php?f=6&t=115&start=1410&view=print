I'd set it to 0/fastest, and it played all the pitches too high. This only shows up for NSFs with the PAL flag set while APU1_QUALITY=0, though. (e.g. the Asterix soundtrack, where it plays everything out of tune instead of consistently sharp)

<br />
<br />For instance in Erika track 3 channel 5 should be echoing channel 4.
<br />
<br />These two games are from the same composer / company / year, so it'd probably be easy to fix both if you can fix one. If nobody else is interested in the meanwhile I'll probably try to re-rip them in a few weeks.

<br />Here's something odd: when played back on hardware using the TNS-HFC3, this mysteriously muted music can actually be heard! With the correct volume envelopes, too.
<br />
<br />What's more, the King of Kings rip sounds completely broken (every N163 channel plays several octaves higher than it should).. even when using a King of Kings daughter cart! I'm not sure what's going on exactly, and I'm not savvy enough to investigate the issue further myself. :\

<br />Fixes include the proper remapping of banks and fixed the reversal of the $411A command (Should be $1A,$41! Not $41,$1A), which in foobar2000 and such other players, it triples the speed!

So far I saw that Pass Intercept, Sack and one of the touch down songs are missing, there may be more but I can't remember them all.
<br />
<br />Once again, if there is already a fix for it I could not find it on the Archive, and if someone could fix it I'll donate once more.

However, none of these play correctly on the PowerPak (e.g. no sound, corrupt sound, crash). I tried my naive-solution python tool to eliminate the mirrored writes, but even after doing this, they still fail to play on the PowerPak, so I guess there's some more implementation details about the PowerPak I don't know about that are causing a problem here.<br /><br />* 19 Neunzehn (FDS)(1988)(Soft Pro).nsf<br />* Big Challenge!
