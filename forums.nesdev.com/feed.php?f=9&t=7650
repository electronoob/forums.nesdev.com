That would reduce the register count, and that is basically what SMB3 did <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /> I will keep that in mind.<br /><br />A major factor in how many cells we have to work with is the price of the chip. Depending on where the split is the price difference may not be that much. For instance, if we need more that 72 cells to implement the base functionality we go up into the $5 - $7 price range, and the difference between a 96 cell CPLD and a 144 cell CPLD is fairly small.<br /><br />Also Tepples, thank you for the tip about each register bit occupying one macrocell. I had not gotten to the synthisis step yet to see this for myself and I mis-read the documentation. I thought a single register was 32-bits wide. Rather the documentation says that the integer arithmetic pipeline is 32-bits wide.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3706">qbradq</a> — Fri Apr 15, 2011 9:39 am</p><hr />

Keep in mind another compromise, which uses only 10 register bits: allow only $0C00-$0FFF and $1C00-$1FFF to be banked and fix the rest of pattern space.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=9">tepples</a> — Fri Apr 15, 2011 9:25 am</p><hr />

@clueless:<br /><br />I get your meaning. I won't be offended if no one uses this thing. My main focuses are to give people new to the platform an inexpensive and well-documented development process from emulator to silicon, and to create an option for current developers so they do not have to put up with sprite 0 hit-detection and 16 KB bank-swapping.<br /><br />@3gengames:<br /><br />I have looked into using 32K CHR-RAM. I am going to stick with zero CHR bank switching for the initial design until I get it fitted to a CPLD. Once that is complete I will see how many cells I have left over and see what can be implemented with them. Banking is very expensive on a CPLD though due to using many registers for each bank to remember what chunk of RAM / ROM needs to be loaded.<br /><br />As this is a strict sub-set of MMC5 I have advised to use iNES Mapper 5 on your ROM images. A detailed implementation document will be provided. More on this in the (upcoming) planning thread.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3706">qbradq</a> — Fri Apr 15, 2011 9:23 am</p><hr />

Yep, like to see how this works out. Also, maybe it would be a good idea to use 32K CHR-RAM so you don't lose the advantage of CHR-ROM, so it'd be the best of both worlds.<br /><br />And that sounds great, I like to see a homebrew mapper being made now. I can't wait! What mapper number will you pick?<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=4311">3gengames</a> — Fri Apr 15, 2011 8:02 am</p><hr />

I do want to say one thing:<br /><br />I like Membler's squeedo.  I like qbradq's enthusiasm for creating <em>something / anything</em> more powerful than MMC1.   I like options, and I think that it is wonderful that talented people contribute their expertise to the community.<br /><br />For my next project, I might choose MMC1, Squeedo, qbardq1 or something else.  I will choose a mapper because it is the best fit my the game balanced with production costs.  A mapper decision is never meant to offend the creators of the un-choosen mappers.<br /><br />Qbradq, I like the subset of MMC5 idea.  But I might not use it, even though I endorsed it here.  If I don't use your mapper, please don't take offense.  Same for Membler's squeedo design.<br /><br />I have a great deal of respect for people who can do things (generally intellectual) that I can't do (and I'm no dummy).  Hardware design fascinates me, but I didn't study it much and choose a software path.  So people who can make hardware are awesome, imho.<br /><br />What I'm trying to say isn't coming out right...  I sound weird when I re-read this before posting, but I wanted to put this out into the community anyway.<br /><br />ps- qbradq, it should be feasible to modify a few emulators to handle your MMC5-lite mapper, just clone the existing one and disable some stuff.  It would be interesting (but not the main point) to test games (like CV5 and Koei titles) on the new mapper so see if they still work.  Or tweak an emu to log when each mapper feature is used, so that we can analyze what would break or not.<br /><br />Now I have no plans to use the MMC5-lite mapper for repros.  But I might base my next game around its feature set with the idea that I want to fabricate carts for a period of time.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3664">clueless</a> — Fri Apr 15, 2011 8:01 am</p><hr />

I think multiplications are a bit too much. Multiplications are only heavily used in novelty programs, for things like 3D and rotations, things you don't normally do in 2D games. If you really need fast multiplication you can always use a trick that uses a couple of small tables that is pretty fast, there's no need to waste mapper resources on this.<br /><br />A decent scanline counter is much more important, because raster effects (split screens, status bars, etc) are much more relevant in 2D games.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=95">tokumaru</a> — Thu Apr 14, 2011 5:30 pm</p><hr />

You have to either A. have USB on the cart, B. have a separate bootloader ROM on the cart that loads new data from the controller port, or C. accept returns of developer cartridges whose boot sector has been overwritten by accident.<br /></div><br /><br />Probably most of the PCs I've used were brick-able, I bet most cellphones are too, as well as anything that boots from FlashROM.  But it's virtually impossible to accidentally erase flash memory, it's a very deliberate process.  If the software uses the code that is supplied in the bootrom, then it it does become impossible.  The only way I can see the boot bank being erased is if the PRG banking register is written to point to that specific bank before you do the command.  But if you're doing stuff like that as bug, then your program is probably already crashing all over the place before it even gets to that point.  And there is no way the CPU can crash and do random writes to initiate any command except a normal read.<br /><br />So I'd say the brick-ability issue, IMHO is a non-issue.  It wouldn't be a problem to repair those.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=10">Memblers</a> — Thu Apr 14, 2011 4:50 pm</p><hr />

With MMC5 you can swap out the PRG-RAM in 8K chunks at $6000-$7FFF, but you can also swap that PRG-RAM into some parts of the ROM address space in 8K and 16K chunks.<br /><br />Leaving out CHR-ROM support would save on a lot of things in the mapper.
