		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Today, I was looking for the rom of the rare, pirated ''Doki Doki Panic'' cart, But it seems no one but Kevtris has it, and Kevtris seems to be history unless he reappears.
<br />
<br />This is because of a project I have been working on, If anyone found Kevtris then post here, or if anyone has the rom (or owns the cart, and extract the rom for me) then please PM or email it to me at JAJJMM(at)MSN.COM, and replace the (at) with @
<br />
<br />I am not trying to be a pirate. and after I am done with it, I will make 2 IPS patches:
<br />
<br />SMB2toDDP.IPS (turns your SMB2 PRG0 rom to a DDP NES ROM)
<br />
<br />DDPv2.IPS (Adds extended music channels and maybe (not right that moment) CHR-ROM)

<br />You found the dump of the fami pirate of Doki Doki? If so could you post a link or shoot me a PM? I love this game to death and I've been kicking myself ever sense I sold mine a couple years ago. Here's hoping it doesn't use a retarded mapper! Here's hoping your patch is alot better than the hack of smb 2 that is so brutally incompleted.  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=":wink:" title="Wink" />

<br />
<br />You're not even making anything more "legal" in this case. What supposively makes isp files legal is that all the information in the isp file is fan created information. Putting pirated information in an isp doesn't make it legal.
<br />
<br />I own one of these carts which I will some day get around to dumping but it's not really useful information to have. It's a pirate mapper so it's not useful for repros in it's current form. I don't know if the mapper is emulator supported, but the oringal DDP is emulator supported (for the ones that support FDS).

<br />
<br />IPS is in a patching format for ROMHacking people that legalizes the Rom Modification process, and you can make an IPS from any official ROM to the other as long as you do not put it on any disk, put it on the internet as a ROM and/or sell it). Try RomHacking.net and download ''Lunar IPS'' for more info
<br />
<br />EDIT: Please email me the rom and pictures of the board and it's chips if you have it. It might be useful for me.
