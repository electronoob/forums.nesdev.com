I think it would be wise to at least look at what Battletoads does. That game is really the king of blanking. Maybe don't do exactly what it does, but get ideas from it.<br /><br />I actually suggest if you're going to extend Vblank, do it from the top. Though if you don't have a scanline counter, you'll have to figure out some way to know when the blanking is supposed to stop so you can appropriately set the Y scroll.<br /><br />Also, I kind of think that the fixed-length PPU updating code always running is kind of a good idea. This eliminates the need for scanline counting. If you're in the NMI, running fixed code from the beggining of the frame, you'll be able to reset the scroll appropriately depending on how far it spills out of Vblank.<br /><br />I think most of the time with Battletoads, it isn't doing useless PPU updates. I'm pretty sure the player is made of 16 fixed tiles, and those tiles are updated with CHR RAM instead of the player being assigned to different tiles.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=138">Celius</a> — Thu Nov 13, 2008 4:54 pm</p><hr />

If you have good enough timing, you can actually start Vblank at rendered scanline 232, and keep the screen shut off until the 8th scanline from the top of the screen. This would give you 16 extra scanlines, and 1800+ cycles. Though this would be kind of difficult to pull off if you didn't have fixed-length routines during the blanking period or a scanline counter. You might be able to get away with having all fixed-length routines in your Vblank code if you need the extra 8 on top. By that, I mean having fixed-length routines doesn't sound unreasonable.<br /><br />But having 8 blanked on the bottom sounds like a better plan if you don't need so much more time.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=138">Celius</a> — Thu Nov 13, 2008 2:02 pm</p><hr />
