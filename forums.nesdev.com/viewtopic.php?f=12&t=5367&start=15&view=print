<br />No it doesn't. It has to be switched manually by the S-CPU. I was incredibly tired when reading that part on Monday...
<br />
<br />Edit: ARGH, the SA-1 does not pause the S-CPU at all! Looks like I misread more than I thought. My previous post can be largely ignored.
<br />
<br />I still wonder what these chips do with the REFRESH pin, though.

<br />SlowROM = 8 clocks at 21.477MHz, FastROM = 6 clocks at 21.477MHz.
<br />Every time I divide by such large differences I get 1.NNe results, bleh.
<br />

If so, could I ask you a huge favor? Could you please check the frequencies of the S-CPU and S-SMP clocks? We know the S-SMP typically runs a little faster than spec (~24606720hz instead of 24576000hz stock.) I'd like to know if the S-CPU is similarly off by any significant margin. Would need to know your region too, eg NTSC or PAL.<br /><br />As for Star Ocean, I'd have to know what the CPU pin did exactly to have any idea why it's doing it. I don't think anyone fully understands how that chip works. Probably a lot of onboard logic to "detect" DMA starts (eg suddenly the read address changes significantly after it sees a $420b write on the bus.)<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">What I'm trying to figure out (to decide which SNES pins I actually have to connect to the FPGA) is how the SA-1 manages to halt/suspend the S-CPU during concurrent access of the same memory area (e.g. both SA-1 and S-CPU access the ROM).</div><br /><br />Not possible. What happens is the SA-1 stalls its own CPU whenever the S-CPU tries to access the same logical device (I-RAM, BW-RAM or ROM.) It's actually quite complex the way it interleaves memory accesses. Very difficult to emulate.<br /><br />The SuperFX doesn't have this problem since they cannot share ROM / RAM at the same time. There's a bit setting that tells you which chip can access it. If the GSU/SFX has control, the S-CPU gets back pre-determined "dummy" results:<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">uint8 SuperFXCPUROM::read&#40;unsigned addr&#41; &#123;<br />&nbsp; if&#40;superfx.regs.sfr.g &amp;&amp; superfx.regs.scmr.ron&#41; &#123;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; static const uint8_t data&#91;16&#93; = &#123;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 0x00, 0x01, 0x00, 0x01, 0x04, 0x01, 0x00, 0x01,<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 0x00, 0x01, 0x08, 0x01, 0x00, 0x01, 0x0c, 0x01,<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &#125;;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; return data&#91;addr &amp; 15&#93;;<br />&nbsp; &#125;<br />&nbsp; return memory::cartrom.read&#40;addr&#41;;<br />&#125;</div><br />... used to fake interrupt vector fetching to point it at WRAM locations.<br /><br />If the S-CPU has control and the GSU tries to access ROM / RAM, it will lock the chip until the S-CPU gives control back. <em>Much</em> nicer to emulate.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">Nothing?

<br />
<br />The BS-X Satellaview base cart has PSRAM. I don't know if any carts make use of the /REFRESH signal or not, though. I'm more of a software guy ...

<br />If it is, then the colors would probably be incorrect, as the PPU generates the color subcarrier at Fsc = Fmaster/6, and TVs depend on the Fsc being pretty damn close to spec. There are 640*7/24 = 186 cycles of the color subcarrier on a scanline, which means that if Fsc is off by 2700 parts per million, the colors will be 180 degrees out of phase on the right side. Google <strong>ntsc color subcarrier tolerance</strong> brought me to <a href="http://www.tpub.com/content/armycomsystems/SS0606/SS06060025.htm" class="postlink">this page</a>, which appears to claim that the tolerance on Fsc is 10 Hz, or about 3 parts per million.

<br />
<br />CPU clock freq, NTSC, non-interlaced mode = 21.47727MHz
<br />CPU clock freq, NTSC, interlaced mode = 21.47727MHz
<br />
<br />CPU clock freq, PAL, non-interlaced mode = 21.28137MHz
<br />CPU clock freq, PAL, interlaced mode = 21.28137MHz
<br />
<br />Number of clock cycles per pixel: MODEs 5,6 == 2 cycles, MODEs 1-4,7 == 4 cycles
<br />
<br />Number of clock cycles per horizonal line: 1364 (341*4)
<br />
<br />NTSC non-interlaced scanline count, first field: 262
<br />NTSC interlaced scanline count, first field: 262
<br />PAL non-interlaced scanline count, first field: 312
<br />PAL interlaced scanline count, first field: 312
<br />
<br />NTSC non-interlaced scanline count, second field: 262
<br />NTSC interlaced scanline count, second field: 263
<br />PAL non-interlaced scanline count, second field: 312
<br />PAL interlaced scanline count, second field: 313
<br />
<br />One CPU machine cycle == 6 clock cycles (FastROM), 8 clock cycles (MediumROM (?!)), 12 clock cycles (SlowROM)
<br />
<br />There's no difference in sound timing (re: S-SMP) between any of the above models/units/revisions.
<br />
<br />I don't have any clock frequency details for the S-SMP, sadly.

<br />
<br />I'd love to help, but my equipment (Philips PM 3260) doesn't provide such precise readouts, let alone frequency measurements. All I could say is "yup, definitely around 21MHz!".
<br />
<br />Regarding color subcarrier frequency, I think modern TVs might be more tolerant. I have a PAL 1chip SNES which cannot simply be switch-modded to 50/60Hz, you also have to provide an additional quartz crystal. Unable to find a 21.477MHz crystal I ripped a 21.44MHz off a Yoshi's Island cartridge (hey, the GSU-2 doesn't seem to mind running @25MHz). I still get a color picture in 60Hz mode (which is then effectively PAL 3.58 <img src="./images/smilies/icon_eek.gif" alt=":shock:" title="Shocked" />).
