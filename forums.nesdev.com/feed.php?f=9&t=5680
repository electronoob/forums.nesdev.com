I'm with Bregalad here. This discussion has taken place time and again on this forum, and also on the mailing list before this forum even existed. And it has never ever resulted in anything but people (including me) disagreeing about exactly what hypothetical features they want on their hypothetical ideal mapper for their even more hypothetical game release.<br /><br />Tell you what, go finish that awesome game for any existing mapper you might find (including homebrewn powerpak ones), and I will personally spend late nights of my free time to help you design a version intended for massproduction.<br /><br />The reality is that doers decide what gets done, not thinkers. And doers get things done because they have learned to spend enough time on just one of all the cool crazy ideas they get. (and scaling it down where appropriate)<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=106">Bananmos</a> — Thu Oct 29, 2009 1:31 pm</p><hr />

I would like to see a good mapper like this.  I didn't try a CPLD or FPGA before because I figured the cost/benefit had a ways to go.  Seems to be getting better though.  A 64 macrocell CPLD (with 32 I/O pins) can be had for little over $2.  That's about the price range that I'm interested in.<br /><br />If there is an inexpensive FPGA, it could be paired with an MCU for more flexible configuration options.  I suppose the same could be done with a CPLD, but they might not have enough erase/write cycles to be interesting for that (not sure).  It's just that when I think of something like this, I think the NES itself should really be able to fully use it.  It shouldn't matter as much how many crazy features the chip supports, if you can get by with only loading the parts you need at the moment.<br /><br />Yeah I remember thinking of the tile $FF trick, I didn't know at the time that MMC2/Punchout does that, so I was a little surprised.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=10">Memblers</a> — Thu Oct 29, 2009 1:09 pm</p><hr />

If you really want MMC5-like functionality and beyond, consider duplicating the Powerpak solution in mass-produced carts. Doing a search on Avnet reveals that Spartan2 chips with 15000 gates can be ordered for &lt; $10. A 50000 gate variant for &lt; $15. <br /><br />And for most kinds of prototyping your powerpak will work fine until you actually make something worthwhile. Sure it increases the costs of making the carts somewhat, but the increase is still within reasonable limits, especially if the alternative is a relatively expensive CPLD that will do much less.<br /><br />Of course, the fact that most FPGAs are RAM based (there are exceptions to this) may seem problematic. But if you use the 15K variant the FPGA configuration you need to load is only around 24KB uncompressed, and by using some extra logic parts for the reset sequence you could make the NES CPU start at a fixed 32kb bank where the consifguration data and FPGA loading code is stored.<br /><br />Sure it will be somewhat expensive to mass manufacture, but if you're already considering advanced mappers I don't think it's that critical. I don't buy the argument that this is what's stopping anybody from trying out more complicated mapper designs. I think the main reason is we tend to talk too much about ideas and play around too little with them around here... ;)<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=106">Bananmos</a> — Wed Oct 28, 2009 12:02 pm</p><hr />

I could use the same 32-way unrolled loop to copy a whole status bar, or a whole row of background when scrolling vertically, or a pair of decompressed tiles, all of which are generated at run time. A different unrolled loop involving specially interleaved tile data might work better for character animation using uncompressed cels.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=9">tepples</a> — Wed Oct 28, 2009 8:58 am</p><hr />
