Playing NES (or any other RGB capable/modded system) in RGB is the best experience ever. I don't really care much for Zapper or any other light gun games, so no skin off my back. I love the crisp, vibrant graphics on my 37" RGB/VGA monitor. It's like I am playing on an arcade monitor. <br /><br />DaddyLongLegs,<br /><br />perhaps if you are not technically skilled with soldering, look up a guy on this forum by the name of acem77. He is the RGB modding guru around these parts, and he did my  RGB NES, as well as my RGB 3DO. Tell him I sent you <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />in the mean time, have a look at my RGB NES setup (shiny black custom paint, HES Unidater, Famicom Disk System with write mod):<br /><br /><img src="http://img138.imageshack.us/img138/9770/nesdisksystem.jpg" alt="Image" /><br />By <a href="http://profile.imageshack.us/user/eastbayarb" class="postlink">eastbayarb</a> at 2010-03-07<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3485">RGB_Gamer</a> — Wed Mar 16, 2011 6:20 pm</p><hr />

Tbh no this is probably not something you'd want to do if you cant solder very well. (For one removing the old ppu is a bitch) You'll need an amplification board for the rgb. (one can be found on gamesx.com iirc)<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3369">Jeroen</a> — Wed Feb 23, 2011 1:09 pm</p><hr />

Before anyone says "who is this guy with one post count starting a thread?" I can assure you I am not exactly asking anyone to do the research for me. I am simply coming here for help since my mind is spinning after reading up on all this. <br /><br />I want my front-loading US NES to display RGB. I modded my Snes mini to do RGB and the result was fantastic. I don't think I can go back to composite ever again. <br /><br />I have been reading up on the subject a lot, so I went and bought a VS Tennis board, which is supposed to have the proper PPU on it. However, mine has 3 chips on it, all appear to be game data; none PPU. I could be wrong, but it basically looks like every other PlayChoice game board I could find. This confuses me. <br /><br />Being the impatient person that I am, I ordered a PlayChoice 10 motherboard, guaranteeing I will be playing NES the way it should be in no time. <br /><br />However, after doing a lot of research, I have found just swapping the PPU isn't enough. Apparently there is another board I am supposed to put in my NES as well? I don't know if it's to adjust brightness (I thought resistors would do that?) or to help curtail any picture noise or ugly borders or anything, but any info on that would be helpful. <br /><br />I am only moderate when it comes to soldering. I've soldered the RGB, composite sync and s-video lines on my SNES Mini, but that's about it. Is this something I should even bother doing myself? <br /><br />I am also reading that I need to do a mod to the RetroPak to allow it to display RGB. Can someone elaborate on this a bit? Is it a physical mod or is it just changing the files on the CF card?<br /><br />Anyone who can help...major thanks!<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=4776">DaddyLongLegs</a> — Wed Feb 23, 2011 11:59 am</p><hr />
