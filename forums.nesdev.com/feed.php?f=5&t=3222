I discovered the wonderfull series of Fire Emblem trough emulation, and this lead me to buy the two GBA Fire Emblem games released outisde of japan. I also discovered the great Mega Man series trough emulation, and this leads me to buy two Mega Man battle Network games for the GBA (and I'm planning to buy the other as well), wich I wouldn't know if a fried wouldn't have told me about Mega Man on the NES first. Not to mention I bought Dragon Quest VIII for the PS2 right on it's release date because I loved those on the NES, and I also bought Breath of Fire Draogn Quarted and I would never buy that game if I hadn'nt played and loved Breath of Fire trough emulation.<br /><br />Both Nintendo and Sony sold me games they would probably not have sold to me without me playing earlier installements of the same series in an emulator.<br /><br />On another hand, I don't buy some remake like Mega Man &amp; Bass GBA, or Final Fantasy Dawn of Souls, or Breath of Fire GBA, because I have played the roms of their games in their original form, and they were better on the (S)NES than they were remake.<br /><br />In other words, for my particular case, I noted that emulation promoted me to buy brand new games of old franchises featuring trademarks and characters of games I could play emulated. However, this seriously retain me to buy port of older games I can get emulated.<br /><br />If the same applies to the gaming communauty in general, this promote the video game industry to create <strong>brand new games</strong>, and hurts the remakes of old games. So this <strong>*should*</strong> force gaming companies to INNOVATE and not release stupid ports again and again. It looks like Nintendo did NOT understand this, tough. What if Capcom would release a brand new "Breath of Fire Advance" for the GBA instead of just porting the two first SNES games with worse music and everyting else unchanged, including the terrible translation ? Come on I'd rush on buying it, instead of being disgusted by those bland remakes. And if Square would have released a SINGLE new Final Fantasy game for the GBA instead of 3 ports, I'd sure buy it right away, and I'm not even sure it'd be more work for them, just more sales. This would promote the video games as an art form, instead of as just a buisness.<br /><br />Overall, for me, emulating a commecrial game is like photocopying a commercial book. It's illegal in theory, but <em>everyone</em> does this. And the book industry hasn't been down the day the photocopiers have been available.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"><br />Why does a Google search for this title turn up a ROM site before a review?<br /></div><br />Lol, got the same results, that's a fun fact.<br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"><br />And if The Tetris Company's anti-clone arguments are anything to go by, Capcom is being hurt because you're downloading Magical Doropie instead of buying Capcom's latest Mega Man game for PSP.<br /></div><br />Magical Droopie's graphics are SO obviously copied from Mega Man !! And, there is only 3 Mega Man for the PSP out, and they are respecively a remake of the original NES Mega Man, a remake of the original SNES Mega Man X and a remake of the PS1 Mega Man Legends. Yes, that makes 3 remakes. Capcom could release brand new games worth buying.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=38">Bregalad</a> — Sun Apr 15, 2007 8:41 am</p><hr />

From the site:<br /><strong><br />Are Game Copying Devices Illegal?<br /><br />Yes. Game copiers enable users to illegally copy video game software onto floppy disks, writeable compact disks or the hard drive of a personal computer. They enable the user to make, play and distribute illegal copies of video game software which violates Nintendo's copyrights and trademarks. These devices also allow for the uploading and downloading of ROMs to and from the Internet. Based upon the functions of these devices, they are illegal.</strong><br /><br />I thought it wasn't illegal to make a copy of your own game ?<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=2769">KennyB</a> — Sun Apr 15, 2007 2:01 am</p><hr />
