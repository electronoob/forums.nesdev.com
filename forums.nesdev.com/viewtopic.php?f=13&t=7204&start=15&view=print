<br />
<br />- I believe that a blog would be a better fit. For many times we had new topics within a progress report of something; and some of the replies were "get a blog".

<br />
<br />Maybe I'll restate then. I actually <em>need</em> to keep my current project secret. I doubt I'll have such a restriction in future projects, and may use this hypothetical board then. Still a maybe, but it's more likely.

<br />
<br />Gradualore, I'm following your progress.  Keep it up!
<br />
<br />Actually, I follow all of the homebrew projects that I know about&#058; Cartlemmy's big-grinning Japanese dude, Tepple's various falling block clones, Tokumaru Sonic-like project (what little I can find on it) and others whose names escape me at the moment.  I think that these projects are exciting.  I feel that they definitely add some energy to this community.
<br />
<br />As for my own self-imposed secrecy...  I hope to post something formal soon.  I just don't know when that will be.  I'm afraid to jinx my project though.  But I am starting to run out of steam, so sharing it might be good. I should change my username to "conflicted".

<br />Not everyone will want to share of course, but I think there are plenty of people who do want to show:

<br />
<br />I'm sure there are others too.  I had to search through six pages of the NESdev forum to find all those.  If they had their own forum, they'd all be right there on page 1.  Some users have shared their projects on YouTube but don't have a dedicated thread yet (miau, me).  I plan on starting a thread for my game as soon as the new forum is up (if it gets created that is.  Do we have enough "yea"s yet?).  There are some people getting into NESdev over on the NintendoAge forums too that could sign up and post their stuff here.
<br />
<br />And that's only games.  There are plenty of utility projects too.

<br />(but it's all my fault for not taking much care of it... I'd say that I didn't make much progress anyways)
<br />So I don't need a blog or an additional forum.
<br />
<br />Also I'd usually talk about technical things in my game either to help other NESdevers (as long as they don't steal my idea and sells them I'm fine with sharing them), and to get possible ideas of improvement of how I implemented things from other NESdevers. This doesn't really cover the actually game design part though, which I mostly take care of my own or with a friend.

<br />I think that's a strong point. I used to be alienated by all the technical talk on this forum, but I still couldn't resist checking it every now and then. Yeah, this forum IS for technical talk, but unlike us sweaty nerds who are immersed in their code all day, I think non-programmers are the ones who share the love and could make nesdev more attractive!
<br />
<br />A projects forum could be the central place to get feedback or, for example, look for beta testers. Right now I'd rather start feedback threads on nintendoage since that's where the fans and some fellow nesdevers are.
<br />
<br />As for my project, things have changed a bit and I've started keep my recent progress secret as well. I will eventually start a thread about it here, though.
