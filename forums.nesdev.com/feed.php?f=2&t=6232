Depending on the nature of the feelie, there are places like CafePress that will do limited runs of a product for a fairly reasonable fee. (I know CafePress allows "Single Unit" orders. Something many places wont do.)<br /><br />While most of the items they make are not really applicable to a videogame feelie, they DO offer "paperback book printing" (Manuals!), and poster print services.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=4301">Wierd_w</a> — Wed Mar 31, 2010 10:13 am</p><hr />

About the physical board game:<br /><br />That is Milt&amp;Bradley... I would SERIOUSLY check to see if they patented the gameplay motif. MB is a bunch of notorious ass-fucks about that.<br /><br />However, I wasn't meaning something with that level of complexity for the travel kit.  More like what you get in a travel Tarot set;  A deck of cards, and a folded cloth square with "areas" defined on it.  Not intended for play IN a vehicle, but intended for use in the motel. (or when the power goes out.)<br /><br />For the NES cart boxes--  I think the design of the cart itself was intended to show the edge of the label on the shelf, (package built into design of product)-- and that the "Spiffy Box" was meant to be the cart housing itself.  An additional perk might be to include a felt edge connect protector "tampon", (Fits into the card edge undercut, protects the card edge from getting dirty/dusty/oxide coated, and sticks out a bit with a hard plastic end to prevent it from falling apart from multiple insertions and to allow easy removal. Perhaps I should design one at work today.)<br /><br />Most of the problem with NES carts was that the labels were just colored glossy paper, which gets eroded over time, and the cart ends up looking like it has leprosy.  Making the cart design a little different by insetting the label area 1.5mm, and then shimming the space with clear plastic, or clear epoxy would protect the labels, and make the cartridge art much more durable.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=4301">Wierd_w</a> — Wed Mar 31, 2010 9:58 am</p><hr />

To me, artwork is a bit like talking; if you needed to hunt down a suitable license for everything you wrote down, or said to friends, would you be more, or less talkative?<br /><br />(RE: code obfuscation)<br />Now now, that's just not nice. <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" /><br /><br />(RE: Source code)<br />Sadly, I do almost all of my pixel art in MS Paint; Thus, no layers. Just bitmaps, palettes, and mental exhaustion. (Recently created a 4k color palette by hand, for instance. Not worth my time, other than the fact that MS Paint lacks good palette support, and I wanted more than 256 colors.)<br /><br />(RE: "Value Added" for retail versions)<br />I agree with Blarg on this; Add neat stuff, like a wall poster containing concept art, or a highly artistically rendered game climax moment. (Many game artists also draw or paint.)  You could add a pewter miniature, or in the case of your Concentration Room game, A paper travel version on printed cardstock.  Things that won't translate well in a scanned copy included in a ZIP file. (Posters often have their images printed using a moire pattern, which causes nasty artifacting when scanned. This is because of the 3-layer stamp lithography technique used for mass manufacture; this is a bonus in this case. Pewter miniatures cannot be digitally transmitted at all, and generic inkjet on cardstock is inferior to a commercially prepaired job that uses quality papers, inks, and coatings.)<br /><br />A spiffy box to decorate the shelf with is a perk too. (Too many publishers give you a poorly constructed item made from dead trees, which is not very durable.)<br /><br />Granted, each of those will increase unit price, and including more than one would require you to have a major seller to benefit from economies of scale; But, if you are expecting *VERY LOW* sales volumes, you could include perks that are hand made, rather than mass manufactured. (Airbrushed posters, that are unique, for instance.)  You would leverage the artist by saying it is good exposure, and that they can spam their name on the poster to show off their stuff. Pride can be a real leverage point for artists. <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" /><p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=4301">Wierd_w</a> — Wed Mar 31, 2010 9:22 am</p><hr />

The general use of (L)GPL code with commercial games hit one of these four categories:<br /><br />GPL engine/code, proprietary data. -- Essentially what the old idTech engines do now.<br /><br />Proprietary engine and data, dynamically linked with LGPL support libraries. This is what Loki did to release games on linux using SDL. The CD also tended to contain a static linked binary to smooth out libc distribution issues. Any modifications you make to the LGPL portions have to be released with source, and endusers must be able to use different versions of the LGPLd libraries.<br /><br />Built with GPLd tools, but not linked against them -- what almost every single platform other than the xbox 360 does. Build with the GCC toolchain, everything else is proprietary or one of the first two options. GCC, binutils, flex, and bison all have explicit exceptions for generated programs, such that the GPL doesn't apply. Bison used to be more restrictive, but someone realized that that made it pretty damned useless.<br /><br />Find the copyright holders and negotiate a deal under a different license, or take advantage of a Dual License thing. In this case, the code you're using is avaliable under the GPL, or, for a fee, a license that allows one to link/modify/etc without releasing source.<br /><br />As for the no GPL on nintendo thing, whether their libraries would be covered by the system lib exception is moot, as the entire API would still be exposed.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=8">ReaperSMS</a> — Tue Mar 30, 2010 10:16 pm</p><hr />

I just got done reading up on these licenses, and I think the zlib license is pretty nice:<br /><br />Don't claim you wrote the original software<br />Modified versions of the software need to be indicated as such<br />Don't claim the modified version is the original version<br />Use of the software may be acknowledged, but it's not required<br /><br />Plus the usual "don't sue us for bugs that may be in here" disclaimer.<br /><br />However, this license allows for commercial distribution. I'm wondering if it'd be possible to add another clause for the license, restricting unconditional commercial distribution.<br /><br />I personally don't mind if someone uses my stuff in a game they sell (see: Sivak), but this particular license doesn't prevent authors from adding additional conditions, just as long as the present ones aren't removed.

They want users to have all the same options as the author does regarding improvement and distribution of the code. You have to decide what principles you value, and choose projects accordingly. If you are OK working on a closed-source project, you can't used GPL code on that project, even if you'd prefer for it to be open. By working on that project, you're helping bring another closed-source program into existence, clearly at odds with the GPL's purpose.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"><br />I don't think I ever used in a commercial product any GPL code. I will just have to make sure I don't do it by accident then.<br /></div><br />Again, the GPL isn't anti-commerce; it's pro-freedom. You can sell products incorporating GPL code (and many companies do this). The idea is that the product itself isn't unncessarily restricted. If you want to commercialize it, you'll have to do so without artificial restrictions that are there simply to raise its value on the market.<br /><br />It's generally pretty simple to choose a license: Modified-BSD (i.e. public domain), GPL/LGPL, or something proprietary. There are variants, but those are the main categories. Modified-BSD style is if you don't really care and just want to avoid being sued for bugs in your code. GPL style is if you want to leverage the value of your code in achieving wider social goals. I know the Creative Commons licenses are another group that also aim for wider social goals. And then proprietary is when you want to keep the source closed and be paid by developers who use it. All but the first require alignment of your project's license, since it must fit in with the wider goal of the library's license.<br /><br />Apologies for repeating these points so many times; for some reason lack of knowledge of the GPL bothers me. <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=17">blargg</a> — Tue Mar 30, 2010 8:19 pm</p><hr />

It's amazing to me how people can scoop up ideas from the public domain and then sue others for coming near there own derivative of it. You would think someone could defend themselves by simply referring to the original public domain idea, but that would make too much sense for some. <br /><br />The only solution I believe is for the majority of us to suck it up for a bit and just pour free stuff into the public domain, let the bastards have their greedy hands on it all, and let their own avariciousness cause their downfall by drawing the attention of everyone towards what they are doing. If we keep being afraid of putting our stuff in the public domain they'll always be just under the radar for anyone to take notice, so we should play to their vice and let them get caught red handed. Until then, we'll keep being paranoid and everyone's creativity will have to suffer because of it.<br /><br />Or maybe all my idealistic Latin authors are getting to me, haha. Adiuva viros bonos!

I don't see freedom as a disease, just refer to the comments I read in the past. I didn't know GPL went that far since I never had to deal with it. There is some case that code cannot be released (contract, etc). I would be more than happy to mention and promote the fact that I'm using X library/module/source etc and release any update to the module, if any. It doesn't mean that I can open the rest of the code.<br /><br />I don't think I ever used in a commercial product any GPL code. I will just have to make sure I don't do it by accident then.  I just definitely need to read and understand it then. Thanks for the information.<br /><br />Back to the original thread, licensing seems a pain in the butt now after reading that thread <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" /><p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3559">Banshaku</a> — Tue Mar 30, 2010 6:53 pm</p><hr />

If you use a proprietary library in your program, you will also have to adjust your program's licensing and likely pay the company as well.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=17">blargg</a> — Tue Mar 30, 2010 6:05 pm</p><hr />

again, what's the worst that could happen? <br /><br />as far as i can see, neither LSDJ nor Nanoloop states any sort of license agreement and nothing has come of it. of course Nanoloop is protected due to the saving scheme (the free ROM 'demo' won't save via flash cartridge or emulation) and while i'm sure there's been a number of people who have used the full version of LSDJ without paying for it, i'm not sure how much of an issue this has been. then again, you're not trying to sell NTRQ, but (as far as i can tell) only suggesting that people make a donation to cancer research for its use.<br /><br />the main problem i could see coming up is people selling it on a cartridge for (possibly obscene amounts of) pure profit. but again, you could most likely take care of this yourself so that it wouldn't be an issue. i don't really see any need for you to release the source code though, that might just be leaving the door open for possible trouble.<br /><br />sorry if i sound counter-productive, i just see licensing as paranoia which is generally without need. if i release an album for free on the net, does it *really* make any difference if/how i license it? people are going to do what they will, and just how would i go after someone in Bulgaria that decided to sample it anyway?<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=4315">jbuonacc</a> — Tue Mar 30, 2010 3:59 pm</p><hr />
