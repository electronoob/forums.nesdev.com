		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />For the last month or so I've been spending my free time on the weekends writing a NES emulator.  So far I have just been figuring things out as I go, making one thing work at a time.  The current incarnation of my emulator can handle a few mappers (NROM, MMC1, UNROM) and appears to do a good job of running the games that I've tested.
<br />
<br />I've decided to use what I have learned in this process to refactor my emulator, but I am not sure that I entirely understand how memory is physically and logically distributed between the CPU, PPU, and MMC.
<br />
<br />
<br />Here is my current understanding of the situation:
<br />---------------------------------------------------------
<br />
<br />"CPU"
<br />0x0000 - 0x1FFF  -  RAM (0x0800 mirrored four times)
<br />0x2000 - 0x3FFF  -  CPU &lt;-&gt; PPU communication registers (0x2000 - 0x2008 mirrored many times)
<br />0x4000 - 0x4017  -  APU and I/O registers
<br />0x4018 - 0x5FFF  -  Expansion RAM          ***MMC
<br />0x6000 - 0x7FFF  -  Cartridge SRAM         ***MMC
<br />0x8000 - 0xFFFF  -  Cartridge PrgROM       ***MMC
<br />
<br />The cpu does not actually have its own physical memory for anything in expansion ROM and onward, this is all routed through the MMC.  Any of this that is not present on the cartridge (expansion ROM, SRAM) is ignored when written to, and returns open bus when read.
<br />
<br />
<br />"PPU"
<br />0x0000 - 0x1FFF  -  Cartridge VROM/VRAM    ***MMC
<br />0x2000 - 0x2FFF  -  Nametables ( two actual ) + mirrors
<br />0x3000 - 0x3EFF  -  Mirror of 0x2000 - 0x2EFF ?
<br />0x3F00 - 0x3F1F  -  Palettes (mirrored through 0x3FFF?)
<br />0x4000 - 0xFFFF  -  Mirrors of entire PPU address space
<br />
<br />The ppu does not have its own physical memory for VROM/VRAM, and reads/writes will be routed through the MMC.  There *should* be no situation were a cart does not have either VRAM or VROM for this.  (Ignore/open bus if it didnt?)
<br />
<br />---------------------------------------------------------
<br />
<br />Is my above description basically correct?
<br />
<br />Is it possible for an MMC to take over reads/writes to other locations in CPU or PPU memory?  Are there any mappers that actually do this?
<br />
<br />( Just writing this out clarified a lot for me, assuming it is all correct.  Maybe my biggest problem is bad notetaking.  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_confused.gif" alt=":?" title="Confused" />  )

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />You're pretty much correct however it should be noted that at the end of the $4000 registers, FDS hardware maps registers around there. Then at around $5000, the MMC5 mapper has registers as well as RAM. So you see what appears depends on the Cartridge hardware. Generally what you said is correct, but be aware of FDS and MMC5. Also be aware some mappers can map ROM to $6000 to $7FFF.
<br />
<br />About CHR, you should be aware cartridge hardware can replace the NameTable memory. Sometimes they replace it with enough memory to fill 4 nametables sometimes called four screen mirroring. Other times like in Afterburner, the mapper can map nametables from an area of ROM.
<br />
<br />Another thing is that the Pattern Tables ($0000 - $1FFF) can actually mix CHRRAM and CHRROM on certain mappers.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Yeah on the strict technical side :
<br />
<br />CPU : $4018-$ffff : This space is unused by the NES itself and can be used for cartridges for whathever they like.
<br />Note that a mapper COULD have a register in CPU range $000-$4017 but it would conflict with NES internal registers/RAM. I've heard the MMC5 somehow reacts to writes to $2000, on purpose.
<br />
<br />PPU : $000-$1fff : Pattern tables fetches
<br />$2000-$2fff : Name table fetches
<br />$3f00-$3fff : Palette (and it's mirrors).
<br />The cartridges can place whatherver they like at $0000-$3e00 in the PPU, be it cartridge ROM, cartridge RAM or internal 2k RAM. $3f00-$3fff will always read the palette no matter what the cartridge do. The only way to read from $3000-$3e00 is to do it manually via $2006/7 tough.
<br />
<br />Technically PPU adress ranges doesn't get past $3fff because there is no A14 or A15, so they're not even mirror of data (altough you could consider it mirror, it would be the same anyways).
<br />
<br />Now the great majority of mappers map ROM to $8000-$ffff, and 2k nametable RAM at PPU $2000-$3fff, but you shouldn't hard-wire that in your emulator, beacause some mappers like the MMC5, FME7 or N106 can change that !
