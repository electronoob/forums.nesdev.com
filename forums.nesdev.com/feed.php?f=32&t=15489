Ooh, that's some great feedback; thanks for helping me understand.<br /><br />For the tree under a wall - you're right, there are some places I could have gotten away with that. There are a few walls I blocked with trees later on where you had to jump into them where that wouldn't have worked, however I definitely could have improved the look a bit in most places. Thanks!<br /><br />For the switchback dude, I get you now - yeah, that guy could probably just be removed at this point. There's enough of them elsewhere. Good feedback.<br /><br />Lastly, lava balls -&gt; fish; that's a good idea; I hadn't considered that. I'm not sure what that might mean for ice though. Maybe for ice I wouldn't show them at all (The fish is trapped under the ice, sorry!) - I think that would still help. <br /><br />I think the deadline for the cart has kind of passed, so I'm not going to really rush to do any of this, but thanks for some really good feedback.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=6316">cppchriscpp</a> — Thu May 18, 2017 3:12 pm</p><hr />

Thank you for that very thorough feedback. You're correct, you played the version I entered into the contest - some of that was dealt with soon after. The entry into the contest was... pretty bad; it scored poorly and for good reason. I'd like to think the fixes made it more playable, but aren't substantial enough to try again. I'm treating this entry as a learning experience. Onto the feedback...<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"><br />It was exactly as fast as I could read it…which means it's too fast.<br /></div><br /><br />By far the most common piece of feedback I got. I halved it in the post-compo version and that helped. (Though now the music sounds worse, and I didn't compose a replacement, but... at least the story's readable)<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"><br />There's no guard against shifting onto a ghost enemy in the final warp-level, and if you do, you just die without seeing what killed you, making me think a few times that enemy corpses gained &quot;touch=kill&quot; at that level, which they don't.<br /></div> <br /><br />Yeah, I probably made those guys a little too fast. That combined with the blinking didn't go well. I never figured out a great solution to this one; it's in the final build. I do want to make them hard, but of course not unfair.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"><br />There's another place you can get trapped, by jumping to the right over some ice (somewhere in the mid-levels? ) but that one allows you to kill yourself, so I wasn't stuck. Tepples caught this.<br /><br />[and]<br /><br /><br />There's a place where lava tiles are level with the ground surrounding it, and as a result, Waddles gets burned at a different location than &quot;this is the last pixel I could jump from&quot; when it's not lava.<br /></div> <br /><br />Yeah, I had a lot of that type of issue in the original entry. I think I've gotten most of the level bugs taken care of by now. They were pretty bad though - a number of people I showed the entry to fell into that lava one. I fixed those pretty quick, at least.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"><br />Stacking the tree graphics is ugly; they're not drawn to be over nonground. Have you got spare CHR? There are even points where it wasn't necessary as the trees are under a solid wall…<br /></div><br /><br />You're actually the first to mention this - I had that thought myself and struggled with it a bit. The problem is, it isn't 1 tile; it's 5 (one per dimension)... and each of those are comprised of 4 chr tiles -- so each switchable tile ends up taking up 20 chr/256. I had a full row of switchables, and I didn't have room for much more. <br /><br />I am using chr ram, so there were some options there, but I also was running very low on prg space in the rom. I compressed graphics where I could, but realistically I couldn't find a way to fit more tiles and the logic to show them into the space I had. Given more time I'm sure I could've gotten there.<br /><br />Also, the trees under a solid wall were generally put there to block the way until you switched dimensions. They had function going for them, but certainly not form...<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"><br />The 2.5 block standing jump is …I don't think I have succeeded on anything except &quot;stomp snake or turtle&quot; with it. Adding half a block to it and the walking jump might help a lot.<br /></div><br /><br />This is another piece of feedback I got a lot (alongside not having any acceleration in the character's movement) and sadly one I never fixed. The hangup here is that changing that would change how far Waddles can jump - which would require redesigning a lot of levels. I'm mainly thinking of the few fake-out jumps, but this would also likely create new places to get stuck. <br />I just didn't have the time post-contest to redo all of the levels... even though I wanted to. Plus, I just got tired of working in that codebase constantly after 6 months. I dropped most other personal projects too, which was a poor choice.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"><br />It's a bit more straightforward and less spooky than Eversion; there's no point where there's a forced transition and no point where taking a warp is the wrong move (though it might miss you one or two gems half a screen further).<br /></div><br /><br />That.. sucks. I didn't realize this until after the contest but it's really true. The first few levels had small almost-puzzles, but I never really grew those out - later levels focused entirely on platforming. This also really points to needing to redesign all of the levels. <br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"><br />Mid-level checkpoints might be nice; Eversion had those. It would mean you'd want to add &quot;restart from beginning&quot; as well as the &quot;restart from checkpoint&quot; as separate options in the pause menu, though.<br /></div><br /><br />Funnily enough I never seriously considered this. It was a fleeting thought at one point, but no more. <br /><br /><br />-----<br /><br />All of that feedback is welcome - if nothing else I'll use it to do a better job next time. I don't know if I've actually mentioned it but this was my first full-scale game using assembly. I had a completely separate action/rpg/wishes-it-was-zelda engine going, but I hardly have all the kinks out of that. So... getting anything at all out there was a challenge. I don't think I prioritized the right things, and I'm generally kind of unhappy with the results - but I did get it to a playable state. <br /><br /><br />I understand a lot of what people suggested is simple, and in retrospect it should have been. The problem is I was still a complete noob when I wrote a lot of this code (let's be honest, I still am! <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" />) and as a result the code is pretty hard to navigate. I also used resources very poorly, so in order to make changes now I have to find prg space often. This leads to doing weird bank switches and jumps to fit it in - completely going against the logic I had to separate things originally. Rewriting the whole thing would be great but there was very little time for that. <br /><br />I might pick this back up for another contest where we revisit past entries - I'd actually like to do that. But for now, I really need a break from this codebase. My NES development isn't stopping though - I've still got plenty to learn and play with! (see: nesnet and Missing Lands)<br /><br />Thanks again for the feedback!<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=6316">cppchriscpp</a> — Wed May 17, 2017 3:07 pm</p><hr />

One more super minor tweak - allow the a button to be used on the menu instead of just start.<br /><br />This is likely the final version for the multicart. I ran through it on the latest multicart (on powerpak, yay) and poked it a bit; everything seems stable. The only thing I might do is take the time to get rid of that pesky graphical glitch at level start. I can't stop seeing it now, but I'm having a seriously hard time finding what I'm doing outside vblank/forced blank. <br /><br />(Note: if that improving existing entries contest ever happens, I may tweak Waddles more for that. As it stands though, I need a long break from that codebase) <br /><br /><br />Hoping we can turn off exit patching for this game in the multicart, though after moving the gem data around it's far less necessary.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=6316">cppchriscpp</a> — Sat May 06, 2017 7:43 pm</p><hr />

I haven't done a full play-through after the last few builds (naughty me!) and need to get around to that - it's possible I broke it. I'll be sure to check that. <br /><br />-----<br /><br />Aside from that, JRoatch brought up a good point - is what I'm doing with the reset button something sane to do? I don't really want to do it if it's something that bothers people -- especially if I've gotten around the big problem by adding the exit to menu item in levels, and moving to memory addresses that aren't used. I like the idea personally, but I understand the concern.<br /><br />Does anyone else have an opinion?<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=6316">cppchriscpp</a> — Mon Apr 17, 2017 9:55 am</p><hr />

Ok, I got a small multi-cart with the a53 menu compiling, and I can confirm that start+select returns to the multicart menu.<br /><br />I still suggest that the magic $db byte be the first byte instead of the last mainly because assemblers and compilers allocate starting from the first byte. That way there will be a greater chance of wiping the whole save when other things partially write into that page.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=6385">JRoatch</a> — Sat Apr 15, 2017 7:45 pm</p><hr />

If the reset vector has changed, replacing the binary will fail unless you also replace the reset vector in the directory. The builder automatically picks up on this.<br /><br />If the location or size of the unused area (the part that's zero-filled) has changed, replacing the binary might fail because other games' screenshots, CHR ROM data, etc. might be placed in the unused area. The author of the config file has to find the new build's unused area and update the config file.<br /><br />If you have trouble getting Action 53 to build, post your support request as a reply to <a href="https://forums.nesdev.com/viewtopic.php?p=192810#p192810" class="postlink">the multicart engine's topic</a>.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=9">tepples</a> — Sat Apr 15, 2017 6:29 pm</p><hr />

I attempted to test the A53 menu exit function by hex editing the new binary into the latest build, but predictably that failed catastrophically. I should really get the menu software to compile correctly on my computer.<br /><br />Anyway I believe the other 2 changes is sufficient. I don't particularly like the idea of truing off exit patching in favor of a in-game menu, it breaks the expectation that NES Reset works like a instant Home button, and that held true for everything but STREEMERZ.<br /><br />For some reason I never got the level select screen in my play through of this build.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=6385">JRoatch</a> — Sat Apr 15, 2017 4:09 pm</p><hr />

I started work on this tonight but ran out of steam. Will get back at it at some point in the next few days. <br /><br />A few changes: <br />- New &quot;Exit&quot; menu item in game - takes you back to the title screen. <br />- Memory reshuffled to put collectible data and the magic byte into $500, making it less likely the A53 menu code corrupts our data.<br />- UNTESTED: A53 menu text &amp; feature. If you hold select and press start while on the main menu, you'll (theoretically) go back to A53<br /><br />I've attached a rom of this version if anyone wants to play with it. The non-action53 version is on my site, too. To note, <strong>I have not tested this with the a53 menu software yet. It may not work!</strong> I used the exit patch code documented in the A53 tools, but you never know for sure until you've tested <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" /> <br /><a href="https://github.com/cppchriscpp/waddles-the-duck/commit/f719028d6650329aa22bdb973bfcefbfb0f4153f#diff-7937bd39a5ef2b330ffa9defd3275e2fR282" class="postlink">Relevant change in github</a><br /><br />My next step is going to be grabbing the latest a53 menu and tossing my updated rom in, and seeing whether the feature works. <br /><br /><br />After that, I might try to make the interface a little less wonky. I can't decide how annoying select+start is vs having a selectable menu item. <br /><br />It shouldn't be *that* hard to do a proper menu item, I just need to make sure I update the initial state to be a real menu with a &quot;Play Game&quot; and &quot;Exit to Action53&quot; option, then also add this same option to the level select screen. I'm struggling to figure out how to make this look natural - particularly once level select is enabled. At any rate, one step at a time.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=6316">cppchriscpp</a> — Fri Apr 14, 2017 9:27 pm</p><hr />
