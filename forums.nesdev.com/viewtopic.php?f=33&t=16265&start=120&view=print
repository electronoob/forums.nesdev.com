I found some redundancies in the asm code and put them in a single subroutine...freeing up 6*8 = 48 bytes, and I was still 1 byte too many, so I removed an RTS and redirected a branch to another RTS.<br /><br />Here's this link again. All the game genie codes should work the same.<br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/3gkv6onxfxypt53/JamminHoney.nes">http://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/3gkv ... nHoney.nes</a><!-- m -->

Was this coded that was or was I just lucky?

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />As i didn't partake in the voting (toggle switch did that), i hadn't played this until now, but i really like it. <br /><br />It felt good! I especially like the in-game enemy presentation and the music is great. The levels are lots of fun and suitably challenging. <br />At first i thought the sped-up music meant i was running out of time (it's a bit of a stressor + this is how SMB does it) which felt confusing, but then i realized it was because i got the star. Speaking of SMB, i instantly tried to duck the bee but quickly learned you can't do that - which is fine, of course! Just describing some experiences.  I percieved a difficulty spike on level 11 compared to 12 and 13 which felt easier (did both on the first try but lost a bunch of lives on the 11th). I think it has to do with the two long stairs with bird droppings being directly next to each other.<br /><br />Overall, it is definitely one of my favourites this year along with f-ff and grunioźerca 2

That's not a symbolic conflict to me. <br />The concept of going fast or being in a hurry is the signified, while sped up tempo is a relatable signifier. <br /><br />Also pardon my ignorance - I've only played some sonic game and i'm not even sure which one on the MD maybe a few times. Do you mean it switches to (other) fast-paced, music (like getting the star in SMB wgere the star music is also bright, energetic and happy) or just speeds up the tempo?

It also stacks with the speed shoes' tempo modifier, giving five total combinations:<br /><br />No powerup: normal speed level music<br />Speed shoes: fast level music<br />Star: normal speed star music<br />Star + speed shoes: fast star music<br />Low O2: danger music
