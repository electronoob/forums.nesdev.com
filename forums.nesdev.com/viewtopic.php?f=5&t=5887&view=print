		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Wellll, since no one had made one, I decided to.  I came up with a new SMS/GG/CV ripped music format I called SGC.  Unlike most of these things I got some rips to back it up.
<br />
<br />I ripped no less than 365 sets of music from various games.  I have ripped probably 90%+ of the games on the SMS containing FM music also... AND I have tested all these rips on my FPGA synthesizer which now emulates the .SGC format files.
<br />
<br />There's over 2000 separate tracks probably here, but I didn't count them.
<br />
<br />Blargg came up with some kind of player on the mac, but I'm hoping someone will now come up with a player or winamp plugin for the PC... pretty please <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":-)" title="Smile" />
<br />
<br />The format, as specified, only needs three things to be emulated:  A Z80, an SN76489 and optionally a YM2413 if you wish to have the FM sound.  I know a few people were highly interested in ripping more tunes if a PC player is made... so prettyplease?  Without further ado here is my archive of the rips along with the complete specification document for playing them!

<br />Have fun!
<br />
<br />Oh yeah, here's a sample of the outrun FM tune playing off my FPGA. (This file is included in the archive as an .SGC rip)

I got a list of file names, but when I tried to drag files out of the archive to the desktop, the files never appeared on the desktop. As far as I can tell, it appears that your .rar file uses a newer format version than unrar-free can handle:

<br />Because I cannot get 7Z to work.  Each time I try to use it, stuff happens where I can get a list of filenames, but they won't extract...  or I try to unzip something with it and nothing happens, and the program just closes on its own without unzipping anything.
<br />
<br />I will rearchive it using plain ol' zip.

<br />
<br />Sure, go ahead!  I released it in the hopes that someone would pick it up.  I went through and played all the games I ripped to get the copyright date and publisher (99% of the time sega with a secondary alot of the time) 
<br />
<br />I'm sure also that I might've missed a few tunes or a few duplicated slipped into the mix somewhere on the track listings but I tried to make them as clean as possible.  Since I didn't play many of these games "seriously", I don't know if I missed any tracks or not.
<br />
<br />There are some files that appear to be duplicates, and this may be the case, but playback rate might be altered (50Hz vs. 60Hz) and there might be other differences I couldn't see.  I just went through and processed them as I saw fit.
<br />
<br />In the case of true binary exact duplicates like a US/EU/JP version, I went with the US version for titling purposes.  Unfortunately, I didn't keep notes on which other titles were dupes of what like I should've.

<br />
<br />Don't worry, there are easy means of checking that.
<br />I'll add my collection of KSS SMS/GG rips to the pack as well, quite a few of them were made, and having an alternative (one that's playable right now on Windows too) is never a bad thing.
<br />
<br />Oh, and since Virtual Boy and Neo Geo Pocket are the last two handhelds that don't have a music format for them... Anyone thinking about those two? Both had some spiffy chiptunes made for them.

That's not to say that nobody thinks it's worth it, but I think it would take some seriously dedicated effort, or a reasonably smart VBoy emulation programmer to bring something like that into existence.
<br />
<br />I do like some of the Virtual Boy Wario Land tunes, and someone went to the trouble of ripping them, but that's just not enough reason to have an emulated format. A code to kill SFX or pick music, then recording to FLAC would probably suffice for the high end of effort.

<br />
<br />- What about running it in a NES? I suppose there's no way to disable the PPU (video for you) and inputs ("Joystick" for you), unless by writing a few lines of asm code. I added NSF playback in my emulator and could detect a few ones within writes to PPU, which should have been removed. In other words, it's <strong>not</strong> exactly like you said.
