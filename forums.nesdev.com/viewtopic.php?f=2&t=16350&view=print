		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />So, I thought we had talked about this before, and it seemed easy, but I'm scratching my head. All direction scrolling, without showing tiles change, nor attribute table errors...<br /><br />I was thinking vertical mirroring, would make it easy to scroll left and right without problem. And, leaving BG rendering off for the top 16 pixels would solve up/down scrolling issues. It might be very hard to time this correctly...(NROM) since sprite zero hit won't work with BG off.<br /><br />Any other suggestions?<br /><br />Horizontal mirroring with sprites hiding the right and pixels turned off on the left?

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />For a long time I did exactly what you described, but instead of the sprite 0 hit I used a sprite overflow to time the blanking at the top of the screen. Conveniently enough, the 9 sprites also masked any sprites that happened to go up there. The down side is that, besides losing 9 sprites, you have to waste 8 or 16 scanlines worth of CPU time, depending on the height of your sprites.<br /><br />To avoid headaches once and for all, I finally switched to a 4-screen layout (i.e. no mirroring). If the cartridge uses CHR-RAM, 4-screen comes for free because of the RAM sizes available today.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Any mapper can do 4-screen, but some mappers may require more complicated logic on the cartridge than others. On discrete logic mappers with CHR-RAM, the use of 4-screen is trivial: one wire on the cartridge tells the NES to keep its internal VRAM permanently off so the VRAM in the cartridge (which must be at least 16KB) is used not only for attribute tables, but also for name tables.<br /><br />GTROM is cool and takes things a step further, doubling the CHR-RAM and NT capacity through bankswitching.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I see. That's good as long as the 4-screen modifications doesn't conflict with any behaviour defined in iNES or NES 2.0 standard, so that it doesn't work properly in emulators or flashcarts.<br /><br />While GTROM is interesting it seems it only comes in 72-pin. I have no NES and I'd avoid using an adapter if possible.<br /><br /><br />To get back on topic, if 4-screen can't be used for whatever reason, what other options are there besides sprite overflow?

Those Sachen games you mentioned all came well after the official commercial era of NES games had ended. I don't know what RAM costs were like in the late 90s but there's probably a point in there where it was just really cost effective to have extra nametable RAM + CHR-RAM.

Aside from the LEDs, I think it's actually a &quot;complete&quot; implementation. It even does the flashing.<br /><br />The &quot;extra ram via PPU&quot; thing isn't its own special feature, it's just a side effect of the nametable banking. $3000-3F00 isn't used by rendering, but the SRAM is just mapped flatly across it anyway in case you want to use it.<br /><br />(It was just after the last stable release of FCEUX, unfortunately, but there's an interim build available on the site that would have it.)

Its sequel <em>The Curse of Possum Hollow</em>, by contrast, uses separate 4K CHR RAM banks for the playfield, the parallax strips, and the subtitle font, and sprite cels are arranged into 1K sheets each loaded over the course of eight frames. Most of this CHR trickery could have been done with the TQROM setup, but an 8K RAM and 64K ROM is probably more expensive.<br /><br />It's tricky to use video memory at $3000-$3EFF for game logic because you have to wait for vblank, which may already be chock full of tile and nametable transfers <em>to</em> video memory, and you have to know a frame in advance what memory you're going to need to read.

It does it in a very elegant way using 2kb of CHR-ROM for animated tiles, and using the remaining 6kb for CHR-RAM and leaving 2 extra KB for 2 name tables, combined with the CIRAM for the other 2. It's amazing. Unfortunately this mapper was wasted on a horrible game.<br /><br />As for your original post:<br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">So, I thought we had talked about this before, and it seemed easy, but I'm scratching my head. All direction scrolling, without showing tiles change, nor attribute table errors...</div><br />Outside of 4-screen mirroring which I consider a bit cheating, there is <em>only </em>one way to go really for FULLY clean scrolling with no attribute clash, and no sprite popping : Use vertical mirroring with 16 scanlines at the top hidden AND use $2001 to hid the left 8 pixels. If you use 8x8 sprites, you can hide the top and bottom 8 scanlines instead of the top 16, but it'd be hard to achieve without an IRQs mapper. Hiding the top 16 lines however is very much doable without an IRQ mapper. It requires a constant-timed NMI routine but I don't think it's even close to impossible to achieve <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />PS: Technically you could do it with &quot;only&quot; 15 hidden lines, 16 aren't needed, but you get the idea.

If you can guarantee a sprite 0 hit or a sprite overflow (which is what I use to mask sprites at the top of the screen as opposed to keeping rendering completely off and getting the alternate dot crawl pattern) every frame, you can wait for one of these flags to be cleared in order to detect the end of vblank after you're done with your non-contant-timed NMI handler. Then you wait 16 scanlines with timed code (you can do some contant-timed tasks here if you want), and finally turn background rendering on.
