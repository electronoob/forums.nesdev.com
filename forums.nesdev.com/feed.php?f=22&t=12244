(Darken the left eye for Jim Power.)<br /><br />If you've got polarized sunglasses, and you're looking at a polarized LCD screen (most computer monitors are), you can probably play with how darkened it looks by rotating the sunglasses, which will help you find a tradeoff between darkness causing the &quot;delay&quot; effect and darkness removing the contribution of that eye to the picture. There seems to a balance where it works best.<br /><br />The effect is weaker the slower the motion is, and disappears when there's no motion. Since Jim Power lets you backtrack, the effect is backwards if you go back to the left, and of course drops out if you ever stop. This really hurts the effect, I think, since you really need sustained motion to make work (and even then it's a fairly weak effect).<br /><br />From what I've seen, black and white or other plain colouring also seems to be more successful at the effect than colourful and busy artwork like Jim Power's.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=5165">rainwarrior</a> — Sun Jan 18, 2015 10:10 am</p><hr />

Nice graphics! Don't know many NES game with that big sprites, good job.<br />Did you think about including some parallax effect? It cannot be that big than on the Amiga, of course. But maybe the black trees in the background?!<br />By the way, in the NES-video, Jim throws his arms up while jumping. This looks a bit odd. On The Amiga he just throws his arms up while falling.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=6030">Lazycow</a> — Sun Jan 18, 2015 4:30 am</p><hr />

Actually, the second we announced the license with Jim Power I got an email from Huelsback people saying he owns the rights to the music. I asked them for proof, and they said &quot; oh well they were given to him in a phone call&quot;. The IP owner, which has been the original IP owner since Jim Power was born, said he had no recollection of that and if Huelsback wanted the music he could licensed it.<br /><br />By this time, they were pretty cool, even offered all the music in editable format for us to port to NES.<br /><br />Then, they went silent to this day. <br /><br />So all music is going to be kept original, but it is done from ground up on the NES.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=6288">Piko</a> — Sat Jan 17, 2015 2:17 pm</p><hr />

I didnt know this effect actually had a name. Pulfrich Effect huh. *gets sun glasses tries it out*<br /><br />Okay so I got some sun glasses and covered one eye with it and left the other eye with nothing. I watched some pulfrich effect videos on youtube and watched some SNES Jim Power game play and honestly I don't really see any difference. <br /><br />It makes sense that light will hit your eyes at two different times due to the speed of light changing as it hits the sun glasses lens but again it just didnt really work for me. <br /><br />The problem with gimmicks like this in games is that if you have to have a special item an order to play the game usually over time that item gets lost or destroyed or something and then the game is just played without it. <br /><br />After reading about this effect it says that look different depending on which eye you cover up. Can anyone assure me that the background actually scrolls the correct way if say your right eye or left eye is covered?<br /><br />I'm thinking that if you cover up the correct eye then the background scrolls correctly.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=6785">Erockbrox</a> — Sat Jan 17, 2015 1:19 pm</p><hr />

I just found some sunglasses and tried out this Pulfrich Effect. I was surprised I'd never heard of it before, but after trying it I can see why. It's pretty weak. It does make a significant improvement of the intelligibility of the Jim Power 3D scrolling, but it's still ass (just less ass).<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=5165">rainwarrior</a> — Sat Jan 17, 2015 10:59 am</p><hr />

The Ys 3 one I'd give a pass to. It's 4 notes that aren't very distinctive over a rhythm that is very common.

It's trying to make use of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulfrich_effect" class="postlink">Pulfrich effect</a>, an optical illusion in which darker images are processed later, causing circle strafing in the correct direction to be processed as depth.
