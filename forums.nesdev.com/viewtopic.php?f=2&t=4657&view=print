<br />
<br />Can anyone help me crack it the format used in that game? 
<br />
<br />Optional: Also Include all the Compressed Graphics offset in both the Japanese and American releases of the game.

<br />While I hear he's really good at cracking 8-bit compression techniques, he's extremely unreliable. In fact, to date he's never <em>once</em> responded to a single question of mine ... must be really busy or something :/

<br />I try to get my ADHD-diagnosed cousin not to fill up the hard drive in the family PC with gigabytes of multiple projects but instead to archive them to CD-R. But he says he needs to keep them all active because he gets bored with a project after half an hour and needs to switch to another. Who knows coping skills for such a situation?

<br />I get the distinct impression you're talking out of your ass... and that you're saying that only because "RLE" is a buzzword to try to trick us into thinking you actually looked into these graphics.
<br />
<br />Anyway I looked at Castelian because I was bored.  Player graphics are not compressed, they're just not stored traditionally, so they're not easily viewed in a tile editor.  I suppose you could say they're "scrambled", but they're not even scrambled, really -- they're all in perfect logical order.
<br />
<br />I could outline the way the graphics are stored for you... but I'm hesitant on doing so because it would further encourage this behavior of yours.  I will say that you should listen to Dwedit's post.  If you have any 6502 understanding at all, you will find how the player graphics are stored pretty quickly (took me all of 5 minutes)

<br />Oh, I thought RLE was like that, But I was wrong
<br />
<br />I may look into it.

<br />I agree 100% with that. It took me about 3 minutes to find it out and I've been just drinking some beer before, so it really shouldn't be hard.
