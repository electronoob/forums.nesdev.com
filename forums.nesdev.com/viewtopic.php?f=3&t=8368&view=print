		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />i'm not sure what's going here i've been on this problem for like 2 or 3 days. my old emu was very buggy with the audio and in some games the graphics had glitches, so i started this new one.
<br />
<br />for some reason, the only game that plays in it is Megaman 2. most games show nothing at all, a few just show completely messed up screens.
<br />
<br />here is what Metroid looks like:
<br />

<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />and here's Super Mario Bros:
<br />
<br /><img src="http://rubbermallet.org/fail-smb.png" alt="Image" />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />now, as far as Megaman 2.. not only does it play, but it is literally flawless from beginning to end. what could be the issue when one game runs so perfectly, but nothing else at all? i am suspecting something PPU related. i notice Super Mario Bros and most others just keep sitting in a tight loop reading $2002 PPU status. Metroid doesn't get stuck in a loop, but it looks like the pic i posted above.
<br />
<br />i pass blargg's sprite 0 tests all the way except being just slightly off on timing. my older emulator was way worse with the sprite zero tests and everything worked there. my vblank flag is apparently working, as Megaman 2 plays. (to be sure, i disabled turning the flag on, and sure enough Megaman 2 won't run then)

<br />
<br />i can zip and upload my whole MSVC solution if needed, it's not too big as it's still pretty new. only supporting mappers 0 and 1 at the moment. you guys have been great so far. thanks.

<br />
<br />yes, the CPU works great. i wrote the CPU core a week or so ago to replace neil bradley's which i used before. (his was buggy and had very bad timing) it worked when i stuck it into my old emu, and everything ran great minus some PPU issues.

<br />
<br />a couple fails regarding the undocumented opcodes in blargg's tests but otherwise passes those as well as nestest.nes shown above. my instruction timings pass blarggs tests completely.

<br />
<br />And did you try that many games? Donkey Kong (just plain Donkey Kong) was the first game I got running and it should be pretty forgiving. You could also try Mega Man 1 as adding UNROM support to your emulator should be a piece of cake if you already have MMC1 implemented.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />i figured it out guys. when determining the length of CHR data in fread when loading the ROMs, i was using sizeof(cartridge.CHRfull) which was returning 4 because that was asking for the size of the pointer. so, of course i was only loading the first 4 bytes of CHR-ROM.
<br />
<br />the reason metroid (which uses CHR-RAM like megaman 2) would not run correctly was i had a flag cartridge.hasSRAM which was never being set, so it was emulating an open data bus where the SRAM should have been. megaman 2 didn't need SRAM.
<br />
<br />sorry to bother you all with something this stupid! :facepalm:
