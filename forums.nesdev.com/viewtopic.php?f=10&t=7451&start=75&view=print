It's just a name, you can call it whatever you want, as long as that's the label that gets called when an NMI happens (i.e. its address is in the NMI vector at the end of the ROM).
<br />
<br />So you don't have to replace anything, just read my example as if I had writen "vblank" instead of "NMI".

After much reading of its manual I learned that help hasnt been written yet for trying to include the song you create in an actual game.  So Nijuu doesn't work either for me, i think.  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" alt=":(" title="Sad" />  Is there another program that helps you to make audio that you can include in a NES game?

Just finished reading famitone's readme.txt... going to read it again. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />   Right now, my goal is to get our song to play in Nintendulator.  There is much to learn how to do and so do yall have any tips or recomendations to help with getting my song to play?  What do I need to add codewise?  Sure that I'll get that from the readme reread. Would including a sound file with the song and its codewise info be a good idea?  That would help me to keep the game-code separate from the sound-code.

<br />
<br />You'll need to watch out for FamiTone's RAM usage though. This is part of the readme (I think), but FamiTone's RAM can be remapped by editing the code. 
<br />
<br />You will basically need to tell FamiTone to start it's RAM area at $0200, then start your own RAM variables above $0376 or something like that. The actual number again should be documented in the readme.
<br />
<br />You might also want to ask FamiTone-specific questions in the <a href="http://nesdev.com/bbs/viewtopic.php?t=7329" class="postlink">FamiTone Release Thread</a>. There is a lot of good information there.
<br />
<br />Good luck man! I am really impressed at how you are sticking to your project!

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />The $0476 thing is way off base. I can't download the package right now to look at it, but according to the last few posts in the release thread the included formats.txt file contains that information. The folks in the thread seem to think it needs 176 bytes of RAM.
<br />
<br />Just to be safe I'd give FamiTone the entire third page, and start your RAM addresses at $0400. In most assemblers this can be accomplished by issuing an "ORG $0400" directive prior to your variables.
<br />
<br />If you get to really hurting for RAM you can back that ORG address down. But this way if FamiTone is updated and you swap to a new version that uses more RAM you will still be safe.
<br />
<br />You might also want to consider releasing your current ROM in the <a href="http://nesdev.com/bbs/viewforum.php?f=22" class="postlink">Homebrew Forum</a> for others to comment on. I know that always gives me a lot of insight and motivation. Plus I'd love to see what you're working on <img src="./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" />
