CHR bank numbers written to the MMC3 are in 1024 ($400) byte units, which equals one eighth of a NESASM bank.

Later on I will need to do some CHR ROM bank switching. How do I save portions of this file to certain banks... say for example, the first 2048 bytes of &quot;tiles.chr&quot; are in bank 16 and the second 2048 bytes are in bank 17 and the last 4096 bytes are in bank 18 or something like that. Can that be done?<br /><br />Thanks for all the help! I'm getting excited that my project is coming along nicely and I've learned some valuable info involving mappers and bank switching. I couldn't have done it without the patience and input from everyone here.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=6543">raydempsey</a> — Mon Sep 08, 2014 5:37 pm</p><hr />

.bank 15 must be .org $E000 and it must contain RESET as well as the vector table (IRQ/NMI/RESET).<br />.bank 14 should be .org $8000 and it's where you will put your main code that will always reside there.<br /><br />To understand what happens at $8000 and $8001, look here: <a href="http://wiki.nesdev.com/w/index.php/MMC3#Bank_select_.28.248000-.249FFE.2C_even.29" class="postlink">MMC3 Bank Select</a><br /><br />The value written to $8000 chooses which memory range you need to swap out, then when you write to $8001 this specifies which bank to place in that range.<br /><br />When the MMC3 starts up, the contents of $8000-DFFF is unknown. Only the fixed bank at $E000-FFFF is known, and it is bank 15. This means the code that runs on startup (i.e. RESET) needs to be placed in bank 15. You can set up the other memory regions in your RESET code, then it will be safe to jump to them.<br /><br />MMC3 has 8 different memory pages that can be banked. 6 are on the PPU (CHR), and 2 are on the CPU (PRG). There's an additional mode select whether you want to be able to swap banks in either $8000-9FFF, or $C000-DFFF. Since you need to swap DPCM, you need the latter mode. To select this mode, make sure you have bit 6 set whenever you write a byte to $8000 (i.e. the upper nibble should be $4 or $C). Here is some example code to assign banks to the PRG pages:<br /><br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">lda #$47<br />sta $8000 ; fix $8000-9FFF to bank 14, and chose page 7 ($A000-BFFF)<br />lda #5<br />sta $8001 ; set page 7 to use bank 5<br />lda #$46<br />sta $8000 ; fix $8000-9FFF to bank 14, and choose page 6 ($C000-DFFF)<br />lda #3<br />sta $8001 ; set page 6 to use bank 3</div><p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=5165">rainwarrior</a> — Mon Sep 08, 2014 3:48 pm</p><hr />

The previous post mentioned I should do some write (probably right after the iNES header) like this:<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">LDA #6 (controls which NESASM bank is mapped from $8000-$9FFF)<br />STA $8000<br />LDA #0 (the NESASM bank number to switch in)<br />STA $8001</div><br />...which doesn't make sense to me because<br />1) shouldn't it be LDA #$06 or LDA #$60 or something?<br />2) What does the 6 mean?<br /><br />OK from here, what do I put in the ? marks above and what other code do I need to include and where? Sorry for the confusion but I keep experimenting with bank numbers and .org addresses and each time the screen is just grey. The game works just fine when I was using mapper 0 but I'm just trying to convert this project to mapper 4.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=6543">raydempsey</a> — Mon Sep 08, 2014 3:25 pm</p><hr />

I understand that if I set .inesprg to 8 in the iNES header, I was informed that there will be 16 different 8K program banks to work with, bank 14 fixed at $8000 and bank 15 is apparently fixed at $E000. Keep in mind, I have not successfully got the MMC3 even initialized.<br /><br />My goal is still to initialize the MMC3 mapper, to get the main program code to run from $8000 (bank 14), and have the main program to run from $8000 from the very start. If I can accomplish that, I can move to my next objective.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=6543">raydempsey</a> — Mon Sep 08, 2014 1:54 pm</p><hr />

According to what everyone is saying, it sounds like my iNES header should be:<br /><br />  .inesmap 4   ; mapper 4 = MMC3<br />  .inesprg 8<br />  .ineschr 4<br />  .inesmir 3<br /><br />But the only way I can get my code to run with mapper 004 is under these settings:<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">  .inesmap 4   ; mapper 4 = MMC3<br />  .inesprg 1   ; 1x 16KB PRG code<br />  .ineschr 1   ; 1x  8KB CHR data<br />  .inesmir 3   ; background mirroring</div><br />my code is then:<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">  .bank 0<br />  .org $C000</div><br />(main program)<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">  .bank 1<br />  .org $E000</div><br />(.db info)<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">  .org $FFFA     ;first of the three vectors starts here<br />  .dw NMI        ;when an NMI happens (once per frame if enabled) the processor will jump to the label NMI<br />  .dw RESET      ;when the processor first turns on or is reset, it will jump to the label RESET<br />  .dw 0          ;external interrupt IRQ is not used in this tutorial<br /><br />  .bank 0<br />  .org $D000<br />  .incbin &quot;sample.dmc&quot;<br /><br />  .bank 2<br />  .org $0000<br />  .incbin &quot;tiles.chr&quot; </div><br /><br />Under these settings, the game is running but these are not the settings I want to use. I want to use the iNES header as seen at the top of this post with .inesprg 8 etc. Currently, my main program is in $C000 but I want it in $8000 and the game to run from $8000 from the start. I want my .db info at $9000 instead of $E000, and i want my samples in $C000-DFFF. I do not know what I need to change or what write I need to perform to get the game to start running from address $8000.<br /><br />What changes do I need to make to achieve my goal? I have a feeling that I'm really close. I need to accomplish this so I can set up a system where I bank switch $C000-DFFF a bunch for my DPCM channel samples.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=6543">raydempsey</a> — Sun Sep 07, 2014 6:58 pm</p><hr />

Since your suggestions, I've been looking at the following page that describes things about MMC3 (iNES mapper 004):<br /><a href="http://wiki.nesdev.com/w/index.php/MMC3" class="postlink">http://wiki.nesdev.com/w/index.php/MMC3</a><br /><br />256 KB of PRG ROM with the ability to bank switch 8K pieces seems plenty.<br />  ...does this mean that there will be 32K of PRG ROM ($8000-$FFFF) plus 28 different 8K bankable pieces waiting in the wings?

<div class="quotetitle">raydempsey wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"><br />I'm looking for the best mapper for my following needs:<br />The code part of the program requires less than 4K<br />The .db part of the program requires less than 4K<br />As for CHR ROM, I would like to swap out 2K pieces so (128 sprite tiles) at a time. I would like to have at least 6 of these 2K pieces ready to swap out. So, the original 8K of CHR data, and 6 of the 2K pieces ready to bank switch so at least 20K for CHR ROM. I can also swap out the full 8K pieces at a time and have a few of those if needed.<br />Also, I would like to have as many 4K banks as possible so I can include as many 4K DPCM samples as possible. (hopefully at least 8 but as many as possible would be great)<br /></div><br />Tepples' suggestion of MMC3 is probably the best one to fit all your requests.<br /><br />If you can relax your requirements a little, there are some simpler options, if you care about keeping the mapper hardware simple.<br /><br />If your CHR needs to switch immediately (i.e. mid-screen) you will need bankable ROM, but if you can pause gameplay for 1 or 2 frames to do the switch, CHR-RAM can be just as good. You can fill blocks of CHR-RAM at any granularity you like, and even put compression on the tile data. Of course, the tile data needs to be stored in PRG-ROM for this.<br /><br />Since it does look like you have significant PRG space free, if you can fit all your DPCM into the $C000-FFFF range (equivalent to 4 x 4k banks), consider that NROM-256 or the recent variant <a href="http://wiki.nesdev.com/w/index.php/NROM-368" class="postlink">NROM-368</a> with CHR-RAM might fit all your needs with a rather simple mapper, instead of the heavyweight MMC3.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">raydempsey wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"><br />Also, I have successfully got a test program to play a sample I imported. It was saved as sample.dmc and I used a .incbin &quot;sample.dmc&quot; statement. After importing it, I notice that I would like to trim the beginning and end of the sample to get rid of silence. I know that the silence is there because I looked at the hex values where I imported it and noticed the empty space. How can I trim the .dmc file? Is there a way I can look at it as a series of hex values like the hex editor in FCEUX and be able to edit it?<br /></div><br />Silence at the beginning you should ideally trim from your WAV before importing. You can just delete bytes with a hex editor very easily, but remember that DPCM samples need to be padded out at the end to make a length that fits the N*16+1 size used.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">raydempsey wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"><br />What 4K address range do you typically reserve for your current DPCM sample? Do you bank switch it out every time you need a new one?<br /></div><br />The 8k block at $C000-DFFF is usually preferred because the vector table at the end of $E000-FFFF tends to make it appropriate to store code there. The majority of DPCM using games keep all their DPCM samples resident at once and do not bankswitch them. The few that do usually use an FME-7 or MMC3 mapper, like Gimmick, which has two 8k banks of samples mapped to $C000-DFFF. There aren't really any NES mappers that bank 4k, the usual smallest granularity is 8k. The NSF music specification, however, does 4k banks, and there is a recently constructed mapper by myself and infiniteneslives based on NSF, geared toward music cartridges, which also does 4k banks.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=5165">rainwarrior</a> — Sun Sep 07, 2014 7:18 am</p><hr />
