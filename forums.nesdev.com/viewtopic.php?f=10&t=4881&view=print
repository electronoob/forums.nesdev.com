<br />
<br />I have a question already, because I'll probably want to make a PAL version of the engine: Supposing I have my new engine running correctly in NTSC, how can I adjust it to play the same music data correctly on PAL systems? Aside from using a different frequency table, I'm having a hard time with this. I know I have to adjust the tempo, but how the hell will I do that if the tempo is driven by the framerate? Do I only update notes every 6 frames in NTSC and every 5 frames in PAL? I'm kinda lost.
<br />
<br />And what about special effects, such as volume changes and things like that? I guess I'm supposed to update these parameters every frame, but that would make the effects last longer on PAL. Little help?

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />For this reason it's good to have a tempo that's easily adjustable. And in NTSC songs you'll want to make it so the tempo is not at max speed (at max 5/6 of max speed so you can convert it to PAL). I'm not quite sure what you're doing for tempo, but I have a system where I specify one byte as the tempo. Each frame, it is added to itself, and if there's a wrap around, there's a tick. All note lengths are measured in these "ticks". So if you have the tempo set at $A0, it would look like this:
<br />
<br />Frame 0: $A0 + $A0 = $40 (tick)
<br />Frame 1: $40 + $A0 = $E0 (no tick)
<br />Frame 2: $E0 + $A0 = $80 (tick)
<br />Frame 3: $80 + $A0 = $20 (tick)
<br />Frame 4: $20 + $A0 = $C0 (no tick)
<br />
<br />
<br />See in some frames, there isn't a tick, so there aren't 60 ticks a second. (There are actually 37.5). So you can raise this value to be higher so that it ticks more often:
<br />
<br />Tempo = $FF
<br />
<br />Frame 0: $FF + $FF = $FE (tick)
<br />Frame 1: $FE + $FF = $FD (tick)
<br />Frame 2: $FD + $FF = $FC (tick)
<br />
<br />Though you'd only want to use tempo $FF in PAL mode, because otherwise you couldn't adjust it from NTSC to PAL to be faster.
<br />
<br />Which brings me to my point. What you'd want to do is for NTSC have a max tempo of $D5 (5/6 of 256). This tempo will give you 50 ticks a second on NTSC, which is what $FF will give you on PAL mode. If you follow those guidelines, once you want to convert it to PAL, you can just multiply the tempo by 6/5.
<br />
<br />I think Bregalad is the one who suggested this method of timing to me. It's actually quite clever, I think.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Alternatively, assuming you don't need a super flexible tempo, you can use one or more fixed LUTs which have tempos for note lengths pre-calculated into number of passing frames.  I saw this technique used in FF1 and it actually seems extremely practical and efficient, and makes for very simple PAL tempo adjustment.
<br />
<br />Here's pseudocode to illustrate the idea:
<br />
<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">.macro make_tempo_table&nbsp; &nbsp;n<br /><br />.byte &#40;n&#41;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ; 16th note<br />.byte &#40;n&#41;*2&nbsp; &nbsp; ; 8th note<br />.byte &#40;n&#41;*3&nbsp; &nbsp; ; dotted 8th<br />.byte &#40;n&#41;*4&nbsp; &nbsp; ; quarter<br />.byte &#40;n&#41;*6&nbsp; &nbsp; ; dotted quarter<br />.byte &#40;n&#41;*8&nbsp; &nbsp; ; half<br />.byte &#40;n&#41;*12&nbsp; &nbsp;; dotted half<br />.byte &#40;n&#41;*16&nbsp; &nbsp;; whole note<br /><br />.endmacro<br /><br /><br />tempo_ntsc_120bpm:<br />&nbsp; make_tempo_table &#40;60*60&#41; / &#40;120*4&#41;<br /><br />tempo_pal_120bpm:<br />&nbsp; make_tempo_table &#40;50*60&#41; / &#40;120*4&#41;<br /></div>
<br />
<br />Hopefully my math is right:
<br />
<br />60*60 = frames per minute (NTSC)  [f/m]
<br />50*60 = frames per minute (PAL)
<br />
<br />120 = beats per minute  [b/m]
<br />
<br />4 = quarter note is *4 in the table, therefore you must divide by 4 to cancel that out.  Don't want to divide in the table because that will result in data loss that will make music desync if you use notes faster than a quarter note.
<br />
<br />
<br />(f/m) / (b/m) = f/b   --  frames per beat.  That divided by 4 = frames per 16th note.

<br />I'm actually rewriting my music engine. I'm still in the planning phase, because I really don't want to do another rewrite again, so I know how it is.

<br />Your method is actually very interesting. The only problem is that if you use a tempo of $FF, there will eventually be a skip, because $FF is not 256. To fix that you could add with the carry set, so that you can use values between 1 and 256, eliminating the useless 0 (no ticks?!) and having the possibility to tick every frame (no skips at all).

<br />Dude, you've accidentally helped me out a lot again!  I had some question marks in my sound notes - had very little idea what was going on with certain values - and now I know what they are!  It now appears to me that The Guardian Legend uses this same method to keep tempo for its music.  Only they don't seem to keep PAL much in mind because the intro song (the one I've been tracing) adds #$DE every frame <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />.  I'd like to check the PAL version of the game to see if there is a little bit of slowdown in the song (I think there must be).
<br />
<br />Anyway, this was the missing piece of the puzzle for me and now I think I've finally cracked TGL's music format (minus a few effect-related details).  Thank you sir!

<br />
<br />One "beat" is typically one quarter note.  If you want a resolution higher than a quarter note (in my example I used a 16th note as the highest resolution note length) you need to scale the frames-per-note appropriately.
<br />
<br />Here's a working example:
<br />
<br />If you have 90 bpm, that's 40 frames per beat (NTSC).  This would mean that a quarter note would last 40 frames, an 8th note would last 20 frames, a 16th note would last 20 frames, a 32nd note would last 10 frames, etc, etc.
<br />
<br />Another way put my previous example would have been:
<br />
<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">.macro make_tempo_table&nbsp; &nbsp;fpb<br /><br />.byte &#40;fpb&#41;*1/4&nbsp; ; 16th note<br />.byte &#40;fpb&#41;*2/4&nbsp; ; 8th note<br />.byte &#40;fpb&#41;*3/4&nbsp; ; dotted 8th<br />.byte &#40;fpb&#41;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ; quarter<br />.byte &#40;fpb&#41;*3/2&nbsp; ; dotted quarter<br />.byte &#40;fpb&#41;*2&nbsp; &nbsp; ; half<br />.byte &#40;fpb&#41;*3&nbsp; &nbsp; ; dotted half<br />.byte &#40;fpb&#41;*4&nbsp; &nbsp; ; whole note<br /><br />.endmacro <br /></div>
<br />
<br />Where 'fpb' would be the frames per beat.  This would be without the /4 -- so 120 bpm would be (60*60)/120 fpb.
<br />
<br />However you subject yourself to truncation errors when you divide like this, which would result in music desyncing.  If you were to make a 120 bpm table with this macro.. you'd get the following:
<br />
<br />quarter note = 30 frames
<br />8th note = 15
<br />16th note = 7 (truncated)
<br />
<br />Due to the truncation, two consecutive 16th notes would only last 14 frames instead of the desired 15.
<br />
<br />So rather than divide in the table, my original example scaled the whole table up so that division wasn't necessary.  Rather than passing the "frames per beat" to the macro, I pass "frames per shortest note".  Since the shortest note in the table is a 16th note, I'm effectively passing "frames per 16th note" -- and since a 16th note is 1/4th the length of a quarter note, I divide the fpb by 4 to get that.

<br />But the formula you showed before, (60*60) / (120*4), also results in 7.5 for the 16th note, which will get truncated anyway... I fail to see how you'd make two consecutive 16th notes last 15 frames.
<br />
<br />This music stuff is harder than I though it would be. I know very little music theory, but since I'm a computer guy I figured that if I studied how the NES handles music I'd be looking at it in a language I understand. You guys still talk about whole notes, quarter notes, tempo... that stuff doesn't mean much to me, and I can't find anyone discussing these things in terms of frames and register updates, which is what I actually get, so I do get lost a lot.
<br />
<br />My girlfriend understands some music theory, and she has been explaining a few things to me, but I find it really hard to translate what she says into an engine. Since she doesn't understand programming, everything she says is very subjective to human perception and not objective as is the case with computers.
<br />
<br />I've also been studying some of it with FamiTracker, and I can't exactly tell why it has a "speed" setting if it already has a "tempo" setting. I also didn't find anything in it about note durations whatsoever. Do different durations need different instruments by any chance?
<br />
<br />OK, if the shortest note I'll be playing is a 16th note, somehow I have to make it last 7.5 frames (if the tempo is 120 bpm). How the heck do I do that? Anyway, I actually need more resolution than that for effects like volume envelopes, vibratos and that kind of thing. It just sounds impossible to make those things sound the same in 60fps and 50fps.

<br />
<br />You would decay and vibratto probably on a frame-based timer, not on the tempo timer (ie:  the tempo likely wouldn't affect the speed of vibratto/volume change).  So 60Hz (or even 50Hz) is plenty fast enough.
<br />
<br />I had a semi-solution to this that I never actually tried.  The idea was similar to Celius' idea, but compounded.  Basically every frame you add N to a counter, and when it wraps, you have volume and everything take 1 step, and you also add M to the tempo, and when that wraps, you decrement note lengths and whatnot.
<br />
<br />So it's basically exactly the same as Celius' idea, only its two stages.  The tempo (M) wouldn't need to be changed for NTSC/PAL, but instead the rate (N) would change.
<br />
<br />Of course this is a little extreme, and is probably pretty computation heavy.
<br />
<br />Another, possibly more reasonable approach would be to do a variation of my tempo idea and use different LUTs for NTSC/PAL, rather than trying to do the computations at runtime.  Rather than saying "wait 5 frames between volume changes", you can say "wait 5 units between volume changes", and look up 5 units in a LUT (which could be 5 frames on PAL, but 6 frames on NTSC).

You guys still talk about whole notes, quarter notes, tempo... that stuff doesn't mean much to me</div><br />A lot of domains of human endeavor have few software choices because there are few programmers who also know the domain. That's why there isn't a lot of open-source CAD software: there aren't a lot of people who know both drafting and programming. In your case, you don't know both music and programming.<br /><br />In a tracker, a "whole note" is 96 underlying ticks of a tracker's time base.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">I've also been studying some of it with FamiTracker, and I can't exactly tell why it has a "speed" setting if it already has a "tempo" setting.</div><br />"Speed" in a tracker tells how many 96th notes are in one row. For example, if one row is a 16th note, speed is 6, and trackers tend to come preset to speed=6. Or if it's a 12th note (8th note triplets), speed is 8.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">I also didn't find anything in it about note durations whatsoever. Do different durations need different instruments by any chance?</div><br />Note durations in a tracker are multiples of a row. For example, if you have a note every 2 rows, and a row is a 16th note, each note is an 8th note long. (Exception: SCx and SDx effects, which delay a note-off or note-on respectively by x 96th notes.)<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">OK, if the shortest note I'll be playing is a 16th note, somehow I have to make it last 7.5 frames (if the tempo is 120 bpm). How the heck do I do that?</div><br />The tempo is 120 quarter notes per minute, or 480 rows per minute. Every frame, add the rows-per-minute value (here 480) to a 16-bit counter, and when that exceeds the platform's frame rate (3,000 fpm for PAL NES or 3,606 fpm for NTSC NES), subtract the frame rate from the counter and go to the next row in the pattern. You'll end up in a pattern of 7, 8, 7, 8, ... on NTSC.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"> Anyway, I actually need more resolution than that for effects like volume envelopes, vibratos and that kind of thing. It just sounds impossible to make those things sound the same in 60fps and 50fps.</div>
<br />If you want them to sound exactly the same, you'll probably have to make separate envelopes, or just double-clock the envelopes every fifth frame on PAL.
