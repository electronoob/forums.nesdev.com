		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />So, I'll soon reach the point where I'd like to start working on a level editor.  I figure that many of you guys have made them before, or at least may be able to offer an outside point of view.
<br />
<br />What are something things you'd like a level editor to be able to do? 
<br />
<br />So far I'm thinking:
<br />
<br />Place background tiles
<br />Edit their attributes, collision etc.
<br />Cut and paste sections of various sizes (ideally you could cut and paste collision and attrib as well)
<br />Zoom
<br />Place Objects, and edit their attributes
<br />
<br />Anything else?

<br />
<br />Since I use metatiles made of metatiles, my editor checks how many times something has been used or if it existed before while you edit. 
<br />
<br />Since I can edit a screen, or 32 x 32 metatile, or 16 x 16 metatile at any time from anywhere in my map, it does this so I don't accidentally change a tile in another location on the map that shares a number with the tile I'm currently editing.
<br />
<br />So if I've got two identical 16 x 16 metatiles (or 32 x 32 metatiles, or screens), it will detect that it's being used twice if I go to edit one of them, and will create a temporary metatile with the same data with a new number. If the metatile doesn't change, its number will go back to the shared number it had before I edited it. If it does change, the temporary metatile will be given a new number UNLESS it matches a different metatile already in use, in which case it will be assigned that metatile's number. If the tile is only used once, it will skip creating the temporary metatile as there's nothing else the changes made to it will affect.
<br />
<br />It'll detect something being used twice even if the repeated tiles are on different levels.
<br />
<br />This is great because I can build levels out of screens, 32 x 32 metatiles, 16 x 16 metatiles or even fine tune them by placing 8x8 tiles and the editor will automatically take care of redundant tiles (or even screens if they happen to match another screen somewhere in the game). I never have to worry about adding a metatile to a set, and then adding it to my map. I just edit the map, and it's done for me. And if I DO want a change to affect all metatiles with the same number, I can do that as well.
<br />
<br />It's always nice to know how many times everything is used. If you have a tile that's only being used once in all your levels, and it's not important for the tile to be exactly as it is, you could replace it with a tile that's used more often and make room in your set for a more useful tile.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />A thread about level editors isn't complete unless I say this: Complex games tend to have very specific level formats, which are usually tied to several specifications of the games. So if you want to target those games your editor must be customizable as hell.
<br />
<br /><strong>Metatile dimensions:</strong> You should allow anything users input, no matter how crazy it seems. And you should allow multiple types of metatiles, for the reason below.
<br />
<br /><strong>Metatile composition:</strong> Each type of metatile is composed of a number of entities smaller than itself. Some games only have 1 kind of metatile, which is made of tiles, but other games have metatiles that are made of smaller metatiles, made of even smaller metatiles, and so on, until a metatile that's composed of tiles is reached. I think you should allow the users to define as many types of metatiles as they wish, and connect them as desired (every time you create a metatile type you can define what are the entities that compose it, it could be tiles or another type of metatile).
<br />
<br /><strong>Metatile attributes:</strong> When a metatile type is created, the only "fields" of information they have are the indexes of the entities (tiles or metatiles) that compose them, but users should be able to add anything else they want. The typical use for this will be palette selection and collision information, so you could offer features directly related to that, but users should be able to define any attribute they want.
<br />
<br /><strong>Tilemap scope:</strong> Levels should be able to share tilesets, so there should be an option for grouping levels that use the same tileset. This way the editor will know that it has to take into consideration all of the linked maps when managing the tileset.
<br />
<br /><strong>Object-based layers:</strong> These would make it possible to place objects on top of the map. The problem is that if level map formats are too specific, I don't even know what to say about object placement. But still, you should offer some basic functionality for placing objects. Each object would have an ID, a position and configurable attributes, like the metatiles. It would also be good if this functionality could be used to draw object-based maps (as opposed to grid-based maps), like those in SMB. This is the hardest part for me to visualize a working solution, actually. 
<br />
<br /><strong>Saving formats:</strong> The format in which a maps and tilesets are saved should be configurable, because the rendering and collision routines can work in different ways depending on the nature of the game. It must be possible to save each kind of entity (level maps, matatiles, object definitions, etc) separately, so that programmers can distribute them in the ROM as they wish. Also, it should be possible to select between arrays-of-structures and structures-of-arrays when saving each entity. As a plus you could offer some optional basic compression schemes, such as RLE and some kind of LZ, but this isn't absolutely necessary since users can simply run the output of the editor through whatever compressors they want.
<br />
<br />For now this is all I can think of. I hope these "requests" aren't too overwhelming! =) Anyway, good luck with the project!

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Perhaps the answer is to create a level editor which knows almost nothing about what an NES game engine actually expects (except palette constraints)---that could be the job of a map compressor plugin. My level editor has a big uncompressed 2D grid of the smallest type of metatile, which is 2x2 nametable tiles. To generate data for a given scrolling engine, I write a map compressor plugin. It is the job of the plugin to find duplicate regions in the uncompressed map and create meta tiles expected by the target scrolling engine. The kinds of attributes supported by the meta tiles are constrained at the moment; if I were to re-write this level editor I would make that pluggable as well, or simply be a list of keyword: value pairs that the map compressor could play with as it sees fit. That way, if I come up with a more sophisticated game engine some day, I could add new attributes for slopes (for example) that a new map compressor could recognize and transform into a format that my new scrolling engine expects.
<br />
<br />So, if you tried something like the above, you could focus entirely on making a feature rich editor and not think too much about supporting any type of game engine. If I were you I'd create at least one example compressor and scrolling engine that could play the maps you create, though.

If your editor doesn't know the dimensions of your structures, it will be harder to intentionally reuse data, which will cause the final data to expand quite quickly when you put it through the compressor plugin.<br /><br />I currently use GIMP to draw my level maps, and by redefining the size of the grid I can reuse all types of metatiles as necessary. Then I run the final image through my game-specific level converter. I didn't feel like wasting a lot of time coding something with an user interface (specially considering it wouldn't be a generic tool), so I decided to use an existing image editor with grid-snapping and just code a small console application instead.<br /><br />IMO, if you're gonna make a level editor, you should make it THE level editor. There are already too many simple grid editors out there, making yet another one would be a waste of time.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">So, if you tried something like the above, you could focus entirely on making a feature rich editor and not think too much about supporting any type of game engine.</div>
<br />But one of the features I miss the most in level editors is the option to use several levels of metatiles, and for an editor to allow that it has to know how each type of metatile is formed. Or at least allow block copies based on a easily configurable grid size, so it can be used like I use GIMP.
<br />
<br />Another problem with the plugin approach is that a lot of people that code for the NES have no experience with other kinds of programming, so they might not like it very much, which means the tool fails at being useful. Actually even people with experience might not like having to code a bunch of stuff before they can do anything useful with a tool.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Well, I already have a command line tool that will take a map, divide it into metatiles, generate the dictionaries of those metatiles, and output the level map based on the highest level of metatiles specified.  The metatiles are all square, however,  and there are still a few TODOs, though, which I'm working on now.
<br />
<br />My idea was to have the level editor be able to copy and paste various size tile chunks, and have an optional grid at various metatile sizes.
<br />
<br />It would be nice to have a generic level editor, but thinking about it now, most peoples level layout would be so specific that a generic one would be difficult to make, and probably take a lot of time away from me developing my own game. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_confused.gif" alt=":?" title="Confused" /> 
<br />
<br />I didn't even think about an object based map level editor (a la SMB).  It seems like people requirements would be so specific it would be impossible to do without allowing a small amount of scripting to define  the behavior of the objects.  And if someone didn't like how the scripting worked, which is more than likely, they would just say "screw it" and make their own...
<br />
<br />Well, thanks for the ideas anyways...  I'll guess I'll just try to make it specific to my needs with an eye towards extendability and make it available if anyone wants to use it.

However, I will say since I work with such little saving space, I have had to split up all my editors to do individual tasks. For example, I have one editor that edits metatiles, then I take the data saved from that into my level map editor to drop tiles around, then I take the level and tile data into my object placement editor, and place objects around my level maps I've already made. Splitting up the tasks between multiple editors makes programming them MUCH easier.

<br />
<br />I've been thinking over how to handle object placement in my editor. What I've come up with is to have X, Y, and ObjID be the only mandatory fields. X and Y can have a multipliers specified in the project file. 
<br />
<br />Additional bytes can be reserved for the objects, but really have no use inside the editor. Its up to the game engine to decide their meaning. This was how I handled metatile properties and it's worked nicely so far.
<br />
<br />The problem I've hit was how to represent the objects on the map. At first I was going to just draw a blank box with ObjID on it, but I'm thinking I might add the option of specifying a directory with images to use. So anytime the editor comes across an object with ID=$01, it would check the folder for obj01.png (or whatever image type) and draw it instead.
<br />
<br />I have a separate sprite tool, but I'm reluctant to integrate the two. At that point it seems the map editor would start to get too specific.

<br />I also thought about that, but in my case object coordinates don't always indicate the top-left corner of the sprite, so there should be a way to specify how to offset the image from the object's coordinates.
<br />
<br />Maybe if you had to register every object ID before being able to use them, so you could pick the image that represents it (instead of using a hardcoded file name), how to offset if from the base coordinates (defaults to 0), the fields required for this object type and their default values.
