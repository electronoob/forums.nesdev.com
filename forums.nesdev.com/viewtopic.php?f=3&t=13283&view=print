It's an execution log of the nestest test ROM (see <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://wiki.nesdev.com/w/index.php/Emulator_tests">http://wiki.nesdev.com/w/index.php/Emulator_tests</a><!-- m -->) with bus cycles included, generated with Nintendulator. So basically the same as the nestest.log that's making rounds, but more detailed. I also removed the PPU cycle counters and included a CPU cycle count instead.<br /><br />Let me know if you spot any errors in it (I hope I implemented the logging correctly).

Sorry, but still no CPU clocks on every line (feel free to make a small tool to mangle the data that way, and share the results if you want <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />)<br /><br />NOTE: The log assumes that RAM has been initialized to 0 (there are at least a few cycles that read from uninitialized stack areas).<br /><br />I noticed that blargg's CPU tests are not good candidates for these types of logs because they have a bunch of hardware dependencies in them. For example they poll $2002 in the beginning which makes the cycle counter and the shown bus data values useless if $2002 reads aren't implemented. Maybe it'd be useful to compile versions of those tests that start at a known address and don't access external hardware (except memory, of course). Such tests would also be easier to run through Visual6502/Visual2A03.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">Zepper wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">One interesting think would be generating another log, but using a NMI test ROM.

And having such logs might only be encouraging people to make Nintendulator emulators rather than NES emulators.
