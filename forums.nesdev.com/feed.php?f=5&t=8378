If your game is no good, you should ask people what thing they dislike, so it can be corrected.<br /><br />If some parts frustrate people, ask them what it is? If you only changed part of a game, and that part tends to be frustrating, you could provide save state files for those things.<br /><br />Some people might be able to make recordings in an emulator or on a VCR, and then provide comments.<br /><br />You can also provide comment forms on a download area, so in case someone finds the game the first time, they can write a comment after playing that game. (Include the version number of the games with the comments)<br /><br />Some of the things I have written here assume it is NES games. For other games of course it would be different.<br /><br />Maybe you have already done these things, too; I don't know. I also don't know if it is exactly what you are asking.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=4734">zzo38</a> — Sun Dec 04, 2011 1:22 pm</p><hr />

You could try to set up a live meeting with tinychat/skype/whatever with someone. There are several programs that allow people to broadcast their desktop as a webcam so you could watch live emulator feed. Coupled with a mic they could tell you what's frustrating about your game almost instantly. <br /><br />I imagine you've tried Nintendoage? People there seem to jump at the chance for testing opportunities. <br /><br />What sort of game is it? If it's a platformer or adventure game I'd be willing to test it, and perhaps dispense more feedback than you would even want. If it's not... I probably won't like it on principle.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3504">Kasumi</a> — Sun Dec 04, 2011 1:14 pm</p><hr />

How should I go about finding people to play-test my video game in such a manner that I can observe parts that frustrate them? The only gamers in my family either A. live out of town, B. play only M-rated military first-person shooters for Xbox 360 published by Activision despite not being near old enough to buy M-rated games, or C. don't feel like testing a new version of a game whose previous version(s) they have already tested. Sometimes, I've tried asking on #nesdev on EFnet, but at some point channel regulars want to quit hearing about it, so I've had to learn to ask only once in a great while.<br /><br />EDIT: On second thought, I guess the presence of category C means my game sucks, but I have no place to start on why or how I could fix it.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=9">tepples</a> — Sun Dec 04, 2011 12:26 pm</p><hr />
