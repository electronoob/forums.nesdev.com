		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />LoROM advantages:
<br />
<br /> - You have ROM, hardware registers, and (the first 8kB of) WRAM all in the same bank, so you need fewer 24-bit absolute addresses and 24-bit pointers, making your code marginally smaller and faster.
<br />
<br /> - For the same reason, code originally written for the NES or another 6502-based platform can be reused with less work.
<br />
<br />HiROM advantages:
<br />
<br /> - Banks are twice as large, so your code modules can be bigger, meaning you need fewer far JMPs and JSRs and it's easier to take advantage of locality (i.e. keeping data in the same bank as the code that uses it)
<br />
<br /> - ROM is contiguous in the CPU address space, so you can work with blocks of data that span banks (e.g. large RPG scripts) slightly more easily.
<br />
<br />Am I missing anything? Seems to be largely a matter of developer preference; both cartridge mappings allow up to 32MBit of ROM and the advantages and limitations look like a wash to me.
<br />
<br />Early games seem to all be LoROM. Is it for the 8-bit code reuse reason, or did Nintendo only introduce HiROM cartridges at a later date? Later games are mostly HiROM, but it depends on the maker: Konami in particular seems to have favored LoROM (Tokimeki Memorial is the only 32MBit LoROM cartridge I can name off the top of my head)

<br />I'm pretty sure it's that.
<br />As you say, Konami seems to have prefered LoRom, but for example, Squaresoft moved to HiRom very soon (with the release of Final Fantasy V) and never ever used LoRom again.

<br />
<br />There's a whole host of mapper types out there, and many cartridges will mirror the ROM into both the $00-3f|80-bf and $c0-ff regions. The exact mirroring will vary across every PCB configuration. This can get important when you access areas like $40-7d:xxxx or FastROM $c0-ff:0000-7fff.

<br />
<br />Thank you for being pedantic :) I know the terms "LoROM" and "HiROM" are misleading, because ROM is visible in both the "low" and "high" regions of the address space in many cartridges. In fact, in large "LoROM" cartridges like Tokimeki Memorial, the ROM past 16MBit is <em>only</em> visible in the "HiROM" region of the address space.
<br />
<br />I'm talking about what Nintendo calls Mode 20 and Mode 21--basically, whether A15 ultimately connects to an address line on the ROM(s) or not. I'm ignoring the exotic mappings that are only used on &gt;32Mbit cartridges and cartridges containing special hardware.

<br />
<br />The problem is that modes 20/21 aren't any more specific than LoROM/HiROM, and don't reflect the reality that there are approximately a hundred different memory layout configurations available. I'm not just talking about the four games &gt;32MB, either.
<br />
<br />Again, I understand what you're going for, and a generic term for it would be good, but the nomenclature has a history of being used improperly, so it would be nice for someone better with naming things to come up with some new definitions that will never catch on :D
