<br />Bah, by that time, what's the point, just go Metal Babble hunting, now that's xp, plus they drop Dragon Potions if you're lucky.
<br />However nomatter how many levels you gain, it doesn't make areas like the Road to Rhome any easier.

<br />
<br />The NES DW games have absolutely awful menu syntax which doesn't help (and it's probably the only thing that really keeps me playing them more than just the start of a quest).
<br />
<br />RPGs in general offer you the choice between pulling out clever strategies or spend more time leveling up and doing side-quests to defeat your opponent. Of course once you're at max levels with best equipment you can't go any further, and I'm pretty sure there is example of bosses that are still not easily beatable in such a configuration (Ruby Weapon anyone ?)
<br />That's why I prefer FF over DW overall - FF has elemental stuff and all which allow for some strategy. However, DW always have ridiculously simple battle systems and the only strategy is to level gird. All non-healing magic has always been completely worthless to me in DW, but I might have missed something.
<br />
<br />When it comes to metal battle hunting, you should really have incredible luck to defeat some. Usually you can get lucky once in your whole play-through and have one level done this way, by the point you get a bigger chance to beat them, the EXP they'll give you will be on par with EXP from stronger "regular" enemies.
<br />
<br />
<br />Another source of diffuculy in RPGs and non-linear games in general is the "What should I do now" factor. Castlevania II is the easiest game ever if you have a walktrough, but without any walktrough it's probably one of the hardest games ever made.
<br />
<br />How can you GUESS you're supposed to duck for 2 seconds by the lake with a blue crysal equipped to acess the next part of the game ??

<br />
<br />I'm not even gonna debate the other things you said, as most of that is subjective at best, however yes you have missed things, specifically tactics for killing MBs.  If you hunt them in the Road to Rhome(on the floor with the "visiable" pitfalls, they commonly come in parties of like 6, raising the chances of killing miltiples, nevermind just one. Also chance can slaughter them as well, you get it late, but still. Needless to say, if you know what you're doing, they aren't that hard to kill.
<br />
<br />In fact on one of my quests, I had every char's inventory full with Dragon Potions, the only non Dragon Potion items they had, was like keys, and equipment.
<br />
<br />PS. OMG, play the NES version of DW 3, the GBC version is an insult to the original. The original DW3 wasn't hard, but the remake is brokenly easy, not to mention the remake basically took out everything that made the original great, It's really bad.

<br />
<br />Lol yea I guess I deserve that, like I said you get it rather late.
<br />
<br />However while fighting 6 MBs, It's pretty easy to kill 1 or 2 normally(without Chance).
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />PS. Perhaps we should try to get back on topic. DW2 Isn't your standard RPG fair, and is "HARD", so hard infact, It's one of the games in existance that was never meant to be beaten, everything about that game works against the player, with the exception of the Staff of Thunder/Gold trick(which is technically probally a over looked bug, more then a secret purposely placed there). Also like I said earlier, most of the games on that list aren't even that hard(lol @ MM1, TNMT, and such), that guy has no idea what's hard.

<br />Why did you call it Rhome?  It's Rhone.  Maybe it's you who's never played it?
<br />
<br />I've beaten it at least 3 times without cheating.  It's incredibly easy and I don't know why you're on a forum crusade against it.  GameFAQs agrees with me, every guide recommends being "at least" a certain level, rather than saying "omg you have to be max level because it's soooo hard."  Like any RPG there are a ton of tricks to make it easier, for example putting some enemies to sleep.  Like I said earlier, it's time consuming at worst, which is not the same thing as difficulty.

<br />
<br />What make Faria hard, is easily the mazes, some of them are pretty crazy, and they are basically all long. That, plus being forced back to town, unless you knew exactly where to go to get though the mazes fast.
<br />
<br />Also that game does have a Gold Problem(I always feel like I'm going broke in that game, even the Balms/aka herbs cost a lot of money).
<br />
<br />Granted It's far from the hardest game or even RPG, and thus doesn't belong on the top 10 hardest games list, but It's pretty hard(and far from easy).

<br />I think I've beat all the Dragon Quests I've played, except for 7, and I had a save that was very far into it (and what a long game it is!  Holy crap even the intro before the first save point is absurdly long).  I haven't tried the ones newer than 7 though (but if it's like any other newer games, it's sure to be a walkthrough).  I don't remember any of them as being hard, but then again I hadn't played the original NES version of DW2 all the way through.

<br />
<br />Actually FF 5 is pretty hard(Note: you can either play the original or the PS1 us release, as It's an excat remake), It's not super hard, but It's easily 10 times harder then any other FF game(I know it doesn't sound like much, considering how super easy the other FF games are, but needless to say, you wont be coasting through FF 5, that's for sure, and some of the Bosses are "Hard", with the Optional bosses being insanely hard).
<br />
<br />Yea DQ8 is easy, and you're not missing much anyway(It's a Square DQ game, so I doubt we'll ever see another actually good DQ game ever again, nevermind a great one sigh).
<br />
<br />However yea, the original DW2 on the NES is a different monster all together.
<br />
<br />PS. Yea Isn't it great, DQ 7 is indeed long as hell, but trust me, It's worth every spent minute, It's easily one of, if not the best over all RPG ever made.

<br />Oh I go a different rout, I change everyone into Sam, and spam Toss(costs a fortune, but get's the job done), however it doesn't work on all bosses, and doesn't work on optional bosses at all, but it kills most normal bosses np.
<br />
<br />PS. I love the Blue Mage class in FF5(easily the best version of the class in a FF game, well except FF 7's E. Skill Materia.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />FF5 SNES is hard, but on GBA it's damn easy. Bleh like pretty much all remakes anyway.
<br />What makes it hard is that if you're dumb and assign jobs poorly, for example learning white mage and black mage on the same person (like I did on my first play through) then you'll be stuck at the end of the game.
<br />
<br />Blue Mage rocks, and Butz really looks cool as a blue mage. However, it takes a while from the start of the game until you can learn the majorly useful skills (Aqua Breath, Aero, White Wind, etc...)
<br />
<br />I've heard from Celius that FF4 (J) is the hardest of all and that even at Lv 99 the last boss is terrificly hard but I don't know whether it's true.
<br />
<br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">Yea DQ8 is easy, and you're not missing much anyway(It's a Sqyare DQ game, so I doubt we'll ever see anoth actually good GQ game ever again, nevermind a great one sigh).</div>
<br />I DISAGREE ! DQ8 is a masterpiece, and have been developed by Level 5 (not Square Enix). Like all other DQs, it requires you to do some annoying girding but overall it's still an awesome game and the best of the series IMO. However I'm doubtful about DQ9, it will come out on the DS next month, and 3D games on the DS usually looks like complete crap. It's still developed by level 5 I think so it might actually be as good as DQ8 but with less good graphics - let's wait and see.
