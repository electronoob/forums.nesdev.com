		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />A long time ago, I played some NES game that I absolutely CANNOT remember the name of, so I'll describe it here, hopefully someone knows what it is.
<br />
<br />It was some kind of platformer which you probably could shoot in too. The main character was a robot or something. The character's sprite was larger than what normally appears in NES games, so it was a large robot sprite. I know I'm being vague, but that's all I can remember. I think one of the levels had a weird vertical looping thing that Sonic does sometimes. It's NOT Megaman. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" />
<br />
<br />Does anyone know?

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I remember Metal Storm fondly.  It had such potential, in terms of graphics and gameplay.   The game even had a spread in Nintendo Power, touting its unique gameplay.  Most notably, the parallax background scrolling and "switchable" gravity were way out there for the time.
<br />
<br />But its execution was strangely lackluster, it had garish palettes, so-so music and the stages were quite repetitive.  Also, some of the later stages were heavily twitch-based, which leads to some extreme frustration given you have limited lives and continues.
<br />
<br />I would have loved to see this game redone as a more shooter-style SNES game.
