When wind blows skid sound is disabled, but it works in Allstars version. I'm thinking this could be done in hex editing, what should I look for in my hex editor? Thanks.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />If you're trying to enable the skid sound in Super Mario Bros 2 (J) during all conditions, to first understand what causes it to be disabled at all is the most important. Without any reference materials I would think that during the conditions it considers skidding, it checks if there is no wind, and if the comparison is equal it will play the sound. You would want to figure out how the game represents the presence of wind, and see what it might check in memory to determine if it is appropriate to play the sound. Finally, you would figure out where it is doing checks on that area of memory, and possibly replace the check with a NOP or some other technique to effectively disable the check (remove the BEQ/BNE/whatever it does with the results of the check since the state of the flag may be ambiguous without that check!).<br /><br />The hex editor is many steps too far ahead; with a disassembly of the game this job would be easier but looking for a few instructions would not be out of the question in this case.<br /><br />EDIT: I'm very tired and apologize beforehand for a very poorly written post; I hope this is helpful at all in getting a vague idea of what to do :/

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Unless your really lucky and someone wants to sift through the machine code/disassembly for you, you are probably going to have to learn some 6502. It's not as hard as you might think, and you might as well start learning it now. Something like a color (that you asked about earlier) is more likely to be data stored and not so hard to figure out, but something like this could be due to the preference in the logic given to the 'wind' sound. (As was said.) This would require someone to figure out how that logic works, and how to change it. Then you'll have some values and offsets.

But do try to puzzle them out for a while, before asking.<br /><br />Download the macroassembler from <a href="http://www.exifpro.com/utils.html" class="postlink">here.</a> (Should work on windows 7, but I've never tried it on that.)<br /><br />To get started with the macro assembler type this:<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; . org $8000<br /></div><br />Underneath that you'll be able to type out the instructions mentioned in the guide to see how they behave. <br /><br />Here's a dead simple program to start.<br /><br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; .org $8000<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; lda #$FF<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; lda #$00<br /></div><br />You'll notice this program even gives you info about each instruction you type!<br /><br />Press F7. (Simulator, assemble) Press F6. (Simulator, debugger) A yellow arrow will appear to the left of the first instruction. Press F11. (Simulator, step into) It will run the instruction the yellow arrow was next to. Note the change in the &quot;CPU registers &amp; status&quot; box. Press F11 again. It will run the next instruction. Again note the changes. <br /><br />You can use this to test out instructions in that guide. The guide will tell you want they do, and you can verify this using the macro assembler. You can add more instructions to your test program and change it. You just need to reassemble it. (F7) and step through it again. If there's something you don't understand, ask. You can view RAM in the macroassembler. Note that when you store a number to RAM, it actually goes there. Not too much mystery.<br /><br />The next step would be to use your knowledge of assembly language to accomplish simple tasks. Like say... loading #$FF into the accumulator if the number in Y is greater than #$7F. When you can read and understand 6502 assembly, you can learn to use a debugger. <br /><br />Note: The following &quot;debugger&quot; steps are pretty brief. I'll be happy to go into more detail when you've picked up some assembly knowledge.<br /><br />I guess I'd attempt to find the RAM location where Mario's velocity is, since playing a skid code would likely be very close to a read from that RAM. You could also try to find out how sound effects are triggered. There are lots of ways to figure it out.<br /><br />You can even log all the code run in a frame where a skid happened, and then one where you want a skid to happen. Compare the two. Find out why it skipped the code that played the sound effect. Figure out how you would make it always happen based on the code that's there. (with the extra restriction that new code be the exact same amount of bytes as the old code) Then hex edit the new opcodes.<br /><br />But you have to start with an understanding of the assembly language instructions. Get those down, ask questions about them. The debugger stuff can come later.

So, when wind was blowing and the skid sound was playing, it would hopefully do the stuff that makes those leaves. That seemed to work. But only for some levels apparently. I guess I have to find similar code in another location, and hope there's enough room in those sections for rom for my sloppy windcode label.  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_lol.gif" alt=":lol:" title="Laughing" />
