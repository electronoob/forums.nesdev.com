I'm sure he has had some reason to claim that.</div><br />Well, I've seen PS3 patches &lt;1MB and I've seen ones &gt;1GB. I can't remember specific examples, and I can't say that I've done any surveys of how big equivalent patches were on different systems, but I did work on file systems stuff for both PS3 and 360 and tested patching, and neither of them seemed like a stupid system to me at the time.<br /><br />The 360 launched with a 20GB hard drive version, and later an even smaller 4GB version. The smallest PS3 hard drive was 60GB. Microsoft put some rather severe restrictions on how big a patch could be. I forget the details of the size, and recall that they used some weird &quot;xbox unit&quot; of measurement, but it was <em>really</em> small. This did mean that developers <em>had</em> to find some way to make the patch more compact for 360. Not only that but they were encouraged to keep file sizes smaller in general just because a lot of users wouldn't have the space to spare.<br /><br />DLC was a whole separate thing on the 360, and not subject to that size restriction, but with unrestricted update size on the PS3, something that happened a lot was that some developers stuck &quot;DLC&quot; content into a PS3 update patch rather than in a separate DLC download where it belonged... sort of like the &quot;on disc DLC&quot; thing but &quot;in patch DLC&quot; instead. Maybe more convenient for them to roll it out that way, but the developers were stealing this convenience from their customers' bandwidth. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" alt=":(" title="Sad" /> This is not caused by the PS3 system itself, just by developers taking advantage of a less regulated environment. Many developers <em>did</em> properly separate DLC content downloads from update patches, but I did see a lot of cases where it was not-- on the 360 MS was watching over this matter.<br /><br />The 360's optical media was also DVD, rather than the PS3's blu-ray. For disc based games at least this meant that sometimes it was sensible to just ship bigger/uncompressed data on the PS3. The other thing I recall about this is that the 360 file system layer had some convenient built in compression library, and the PS3 did not. So if you had developed for the 360 first and were relying on it, porting to the PS3 could leave you with the task of implementing your own compression system to compensate... or possibly just leaving things uncompressed.<br /><br />So... that's basically it, in my view. I didn't play nearly as much stuff on 360 so I don't have a good basis for comparison, but I can believe that you routinely saw smaller patch sizes on it for the reasons above, none of which are really anything to do with the patching system itself, just MS was more strict about what went where and how much. I think the most egregious differences are probably just the conflating of DLC with update patches on the part of PS3 developers.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />There's a lot of factors that could make it more convenient, even in a single player game. I can see why developers would choose to do it, but it does require the point of view that bandwidth is &quot;cheap&quot;. (Or more cynically: offloading it to customers' bandwidth is &quot;spending someone else's money&quot;.)<br /><br />Looking it up, I remembered that the 360 patch size restrictions were basically built around the 64MB <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Xbox_360_accessories#Memory_units" class="postlink">memory unit</a> accessory. They wanted it to be possible to put patches on this device. I don't know what the rules are for XB1, but I kinda doubt they have patch size restrictions any more, since the reason for this on 360 was pretty specific and entirely obsolete.

I went over to my brother's house the other day, and he asked me to load up a game on his XBox while he grabbed something from the other room. I thought I would be able to figure it out on my own, but I honestly was like &quot;I don't even know WTF I'm looking at.&quot; I ended up having to create some profile and do all this bullshit, and by the time we got it all up and running, I was so annoyed that I didn't find anything about the experience enjoyable.<br /><br />Besides creating profiles and downloading content and all that shit, I'm totally not interested in modern games. I'm like dead inside anytime I see Gears of War types of games. The color schemes make me feel depressed. The characters make me feel depressed. I feel like there is so much to look and and so much going on that it just sucks the life out of me. Oh, and then you need to spend all this time learning how to actually play the f-ing game through some in-game tutorial. I just don't care enough/at all.
