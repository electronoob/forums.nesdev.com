For anyone even reading this thread hah, I just took out the CHR 301 and put in an 010.  Still didn't work.  Must be the PRG, but its a direct swap?<br /><br />So I lifted pin 1 on the PRG, nothing.  And even wired pin 1 to pin 32 and nothing.  I don't even care about making the game work now as much as just trying to figure out what the hell is going on here?!<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=6290">guitarzombie</a> — Sun Jun 15, 2014 9:05 am</p><hr />

I found this in the Nes Cart Db.  A prototype of Secret ties, that uses a 27c301 for CHR and PRG in an HVC-TLROM board with an NES joint to 72 pin.  I read that the famicom cart mask pinouts are identical to the nes's.  Gonna get rid of my re-wiring and dump this in, but not sure how the 22-GND / 31-CE thing will turn out.<br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://bootgod.dyndns.org:7777/profile.php?id=4634">http://bootgod.dyndns.org:7777/profile.php?id=4634</a><!-- m --><br /><br />Or this Int.

Any update with this?  Having the same problems here just on a TLROM board.<br /><br />PRG is a straight swap (pin 30 31 32 all tied to 5+), <br /><br />CHR I lifted pin 1 22 31, wired 22 to hole 31 (which goes to cart pin 65, PPU A13), tied pin 31 (ce) to pin 32 (5+).<br /><br />Do I have to wire pin 1 to a 5+ or should I have just left it down connected to MMC3s 12 (A17) even if it isnt used?<br />The only thing I didn't do, or follow was cutting the trace between PRG hole 1 and 31, but on the board they dont seem to be connected.  Not sure whats going on.  Did nuxxt mean cut the trace between 2 and 22?<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=6290">guitarzombie</a> — Tue Jun 10, 2014 3:23 pm</p><hr />

Assuming you're programming the chips properly I'd put $5 on wiring being messed up somehow.  Go through and check everything with a multimeter if you can't find the problem visually.  It also helps to actually draw out the schmatic vice just following step by step directions.  If you posted your schematic we may actually be able to help you vice stabbing in the dark...<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=4832">infiniteneslives</a> — Thu Apr 26, 2012 5:51 pm</p><hr />

Thanks for the reply.  I read through the datasheet and you are right a bout needing to keep that pin high.  It's weird though, because I didn't do that on an SNROM game I made, and it worked okay.<br /><br />Trying them on TKROM while tying that pin high still is giving me no results.  If I figure it out I will post back here.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=5261">nuxxt</a> — Thu Apr 26, 2012 3:12 pm</p><hr />

I haven't had any '301 chips, but I've had some 27C101 and they will not work on a cart unless PGM (pin 31) is high, so you can't just leave them up. For PRG chips on a Tx board, hole 31 will be +5v so you can leave that pin where it is. For CHR you'll have to connect it somewhere else- pin 32  would be the closest point.<br /><br />I can't say for sure that's your issue but that's what I would try first.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=5167">FrankWDoom</a> — Sun Apr 08, 2012 10:33 pm</p><hr />

I have been having some difficulty using 27C301 EPROMS in place of 27C010 EPROMS.  I was hoping someone here may be kind enough to be able to help me figure out where I am going wrong.<br /><br />Anyway, I am using HN27C301AG chips.  I made a dev board with a SNROM board, and I think all needed to do was cut traces from PRG ROM pins 1 and 31.  Other than that, it's a straight swap.  I burned a game to test it and everything (seems) to work fine.<br /><br />Trouble arose when I tried to make a TKROM dev board.  For the PRG ROM I followed the same steps as above.  For CHR, I bent up pins 1, 22, 31 on the socket; then I wired pin 22 to hole 31.  I tried two different games with this board and couldn't get anything to run at all.<br /><br />I checked my wiring and I think I did everything right.  Of course I went back and looked at my soldering and everything seems to be fine as well.  I'm stumped as to where I am going wrong with the TxROM wiring, and if PRG worked on SNROM, why doesn't that at least work on TKROM considering I did it the same way?<br /><br />If this doesn't make sense or I need to elaborate, please let me know. Thank you for reading, any help would be greatly appreciated.<br /><br />Edit: <a href="http://www.datasheetarchive.com/dl/Datasheets-12/DSA-230343.pdf" class="postlink">Try this link to see the datasheet for said eprom</a><p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=5261">nuxxt</a> — Wed Apr 04, 2012 10:22 am</p><hr />
