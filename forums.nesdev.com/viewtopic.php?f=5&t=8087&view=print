		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Ok, so the last topic may've been spam, but it's a potentially interesting discussion for me. I fell asleep in the theatre during the first movie and hadn't seen what I missed, or the following movies, until I recently bought the boxed set.  I watched up to the 4th, I think, before losing interest.
<br />
<br />So am I completely missing something?  Is it a generational gap issue (I'm 33)?  Does the good stuff come later?

<br />
<br />I did enjoy the films, though I wouldn't try to convince you they're good.

<br />
<br />I don't like Harry as a character, by the way, he is mostly like a void in the movies, he has no strong personality and not someone you can associate with yourself. Don't really like other two main characters, although they are definitely stronger. The world, mood, and especially supporting characters is what makes it interesting.
