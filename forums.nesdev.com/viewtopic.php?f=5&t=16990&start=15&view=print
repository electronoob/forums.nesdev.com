		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />While the commercial implications of both languages are obviously problematic, I'd say you can easily defend why these languages are absolutely optimal for teaching students the concepts of OOP patterns, since they are designed entirely around it.<br />C# in particular has the advantage of full integration into Visual Studio which is arguably the best programming IDE ever created, no matter what you may think of Microsoft.<br /><br />Fortunately, Mono also exists if you aren't happy with relying on Microsoft's own framework. And realising this, MS themselves have gone completely open source for all recent developments in the area.

I remember we had a whole lab full of Sun Ray computers that nobody used much. I would sometimes use them just for variety's sake.<br /><br />I also recall that there wasn't an open source reference for the Java VM and libraries until 2006, I think? It definitely used to be more of a proprietary thing than it is now.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />How is that different in practice from needing the non-free Windows operating system to run your hardware drivers? This can happen when no laptops in your local Best Buy have a penguin logo to imply that free drivers are available for the hardware, and System76 (which specializes in Linux PCs) doesn't offer any laptops in your preferred form factor. <a href="https://wiki.debian.org/InstallingDebianOn/Asus/T100TA" class="postlink">ASUS T100 still has no suspend on Linux after years</a>.<br /><br />Even if Windows is non-free as in speech, Linux is non-free as in beer because of increased hardware support cost for the manufacturer. Last I checked, the Dell XPS 13 with Windows 10 Home sold for $50 less than the same laptop with Ubuntu.
