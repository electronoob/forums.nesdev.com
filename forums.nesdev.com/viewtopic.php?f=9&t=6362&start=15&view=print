		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />If you'd want to get expansion sound entierely with the bottom connector (without any special hardware on the cart), you'd need to acess sound registers through a serial protocol via $4016 and $4017. That'd be perfectly possible, but you'd need to implement it yourself in your favourite open source emulators, and only games that were made to use this will use it.
<br />I don't think it's possible to make the bottom connector respond to other register writes, or doing so will require a modified cartridge that re-route some adress/data lines to the general purpose expansion pins, and if you're doing that you might as well add audio hardware on cartridge and use the expansion connector just as a bridge to get audio working.

<br />
<br />Yes, you could use a 4P relay to do that.   The single monitor board switches between both signals on the PCB.

<br />
<br />But since the data bus is on the expansion, the only thing a cart needs to send to it is a single chip enable output.  Pretty easy to do on a new board (if you don't like the $4016/$4017 stuff).
<br />
<br />That's way cheaper per cart than adding the audio hardware.  Even if one pulled of some super cheap audio stuff for $5 total, that's not going to add $5 to the selling price, it would add more like $10-$15.  So that can knock a huge amount of the selling price per game, paying for itself if enough games used it (and used it well).
<br />
<br />Xious: That PC10 cabinet is only 2 hours from me.  I am really damn tempted to go get it!

<br />
<br />if both moniters use the same type of signal (I assume they do) then you could install a switch that selects which rgb s/g signal is going to the screen.  It would be a little odd hitting a switch to go between the game screen/choice screen but it would work.  Another option I've seen a lot of is people just use a small lcd screen for the secondary screen.  Or you could do what 2600 suggests.  I'm still waiting for the hardware to arrive in the mail and I've never actually seen how it works which's why the only option coming to my head is a manual switch.

<br />
<br />I doubt it will sell for that much.  You should be able to get that for $200-$250 at most if you want to do a best offer.  BTW, that is the single monitor version and you should be able to swap in a Vs board with little to no effort.

<br />
<br />From what I looked up quickly earlier today, the controls are wired differently for the VS, but that's no big deal I think.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />For those suggesting to use a dual monitor PCB on a single monitor cab.  Just rewire the single edge connector pins to the female dual harness of the single cab, and swap the bios at 8T with a single monitor bios.  The rest is the same.  
<br />
<br />Edit:  
<br />
<br />Thinking about it more, the bios sizes are different...it may be okay to go dual to single, but maybe not from single to dual... i should try with one of my cabs
