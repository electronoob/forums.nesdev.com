Generations are a fiction; all the consoles are different anyway, even if released at the same time (e.g. PS3 vs Wii). I think 360 vs PS3 was the first time there was anything close to parity, but I think this is because at this point the machines are overpowered for the task of making games. All that power really levels out the differences, compared to a time when, say, hardware could dictate whether you can scroll in 1 or 8 pixel increments, or at all. All the modern consoles can do more or less the same things, just at different speeds.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=5165">rainwarrior</a> — Sun Feb 01, 2015 3:22 pm</p><hr />

I do understand what you're saying, and I guess my opinion comes from my own experience and the kinds of games I like. I was never one to buy cutting edge consoles (the only one I got in this situation was the Genesis, all the others were already outdated when I got them), so generations never meant much to me. When I played Mega Man on my Game Boy, it felt the same as playing pirate Rockman on my Famiclone. It didn't feel any different.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=95">tokumaru</a> — Sun Feb 01, 2015 11:20 am</p><hr />

But more often than not, the games on handhelds are going to be different from the consoles, due to nature of their hardware specifications. It may look stupid to you, but it's hardly uncommon. Saying &quot;games are games&quot; is a gross oversimplification that neglects to take into account of host of factors that were considered when that game was made (who would play it, how they would play it, when they would play it). Those things are all very important to consider, especially if you have a mind for studying video game history, like I do, or if you just like playing all kinds of games, like I do.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">tokumaru wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"><br />but once we're talking about several generations of gaming hardware, there are handhelds insanely more powerful than consoles, and this distinction becomes completely irrelevant.

Just look at the New 3DS playing Xenoblade Chronicles for a Nintendo-based example. But that's only because handheld technology has finally caught up in terms of hardware. You can probably thank ARM for pushing and various mobile GPU manufacturers for that. But leading up to current generations, the gap was obvious enough for a lot of people to merit that distinction.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">tokumaru wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"><br />But there's much more to it than just these two extremes.

Arcade games easily create another category in my mind. So it's not black and white, &quot;handheld, console, or nothing&quot;. It is most certainly not a case of two &quot;extremes&quot;. <br /><br />There are still general design choices that are really only specific and applicable to console games such as enhanced screen size, greater storage capacity more often than not, constant power supply (goes in hand with the ability to drive better hardware for a given generation), same-screen local multiplayer, and centralized saved games (largely a console-only advantage when the PS1 showed and until the PSP showed up, the 3DS has yet to catch on with that idea though). It doesn't matter what kind of accessories or additional, innovative things home consoles (or handhelds for that) added to the mix; there are concepts inherent in home consoles themselves that dictate different design choices in games.<br /><br />If you're still in doubt, I'd suggest a quick google of &quot;handheld or console&quot; and you'll see that (as I posted earlier) it's actually common to distinguish between home consoles (as just &quot;consoles&quot;) and handhelds. Perhaps that will change in the future (thank you convergence) but for now and in the past, it's valid to see them as separate. I have no problem with people saying home consoles and handhelds are all just consoles, but it looks really weird to me not recognize that the games between the two have historically been developed differently. Personally, I just can't imagine a commercial developer jumping from the SMS to the GG ever saying something along the lines like &quot;we never took the reduced screen resolution into consideration.&quot;<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=6368">Shonumi</a> — Sun Feb 01, 2015 2:05 am</p><hr />

Wikipedia makes no distinction either, but almost everyone I grew up with never referred to the Gameboy or ever more recently the PSP or 3DS as a console. We've always distinguished them as home video game consoles and handhelds. It would be nice if we could say they were one in the same (video games) but realistically, ignoring the format of in which the games were made is also ignoring a large part of the game's design, style, gameplay, and history. If you don't take into account how and why portable games were created differently from games you were meant to play at home, you're missing out on how and why the game impacted the industry (or didn't for that matter). Pokemon is a great example. I find it hard to imagine Nintendo could have emphasized trading and battling (and making it a wildly and socially popular game in the process) if it had originally been tethered to your TV screen in a time essentially before the internet.<br /><br />Perhaps it's just because I grew up with portables around me all the time. I was very aware of their limitations in comparison to home video game consoles. The GB lagged behind the NES, and even when the GBC came out, the N64 was out. The GG lagged behind the Genesis. The GBA outpaces the SNES, but by that time the GC was out. It's only been fairly recently that I've seen the gap close in my mind (3DS feels like a portable Wii in many respects, and the Vita feels like a portable PS3) so that portables don't really feel like they're 2 generations behind in capability. But as a young gamer, the hardware differences were more than enough to make it seem like there were in fact two classes of gaming.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=6368">Shonumi</a> — Sat Jan 31, 2015 3:12 pm</p><hr />

<div class="quotetitle">Shonumi wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"><br />I see a lot of people adding handhelds to their list, so either the thread's title is a misnomer, or my definition of console is too strict.<br /></div><br />In portuguese we often use the term &quot;video-game&quot; when talking about gaming systems, and we hardly ever use the words &quot;console&quot; or &quot;handheld&quot; (which we don't really have a word for, so we use &quot;portable&quot;). Frankly, I think it's stupid to separate both types of gaming systems, because ultimately, it's all about the games. It doesn't matter if you're holding the entire system in your hands or if it's plugged to a TV, they're all machines that run games, and you can get the exact same kind of entertainment from both.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=95">tokumaru</a> — Sat Jan 31, 2015 1:16 pm</p><hr />
