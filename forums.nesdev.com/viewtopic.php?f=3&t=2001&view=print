<br />EDIT : What are people supposed to do when they forgot their passwords ? Looks like I've mistaped mine, and it won't come up with any variation of it that I tried. There weren't a "password confirmation" field, nor a confirmation e-mail to say I'm well subscriben so this is confusing.

<br />
<br />the nesdev wiki is hosted on Quietust site, which is different than bootgods, and different from nesdev.parodus.  perhaps a link on the wiki would be nice.
<br />
<br />suggestions to the site:
<br />
<br />download the database, but i think you already got that request from me.
<br />
<br />nothing else comes to mind now.

I will be adding PCB pics of my carts as soon as I get a decent camera to do so. I want to have profiles for each board type as well, with pictures and info like kevtris has in his mapper database.
<br />
<br />As for the posts about allowing anyone to contribute: Anyone with a CopyNES can contribute. I originally allowed contributions from anyone by allowing them to load a ROM rather than download from a CopyNES, as at the time I didn't even have one yet. But once I had one, this came back and bit me in the ass because some ROMs I had used turned out to be bad and whatnot. So I scrapped that.

<br />If I want to contribute, say, box scans or manual transcriptions, do I have to pay to have a CopyNES made in order to do that?

You'd definitely need a camera to make sure damage nothing if you want picture of the back of the PCB, but that wouldn't be very interesting, only the front would be fine.

<br />
<br />I've noticed that some scanners are able to take decent scans of PCB's. Unfortunately, mine is not one of them. The faces of the chips come out fine, but the rest of the board and traces suffer from a major depth-of-field effect rendering them very blurry.
