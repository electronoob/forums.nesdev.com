It's too big for the typical power consumption of the 2A03/2C02 (which is about 400mA), so I assume it's too big for the clone ICs used here.<br />* T2's collector and emitter are backwards.<br /><br />Where does VCC come from? (VCC1?)<br /><br />The bottom half of the 4013 prevents the soft button from working for the first 22ms after power is plugged in. The top half is what actually controls the output.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">I've already exchanged both transistors and the 4013.

'scope? voltmeter?)<br /><br />I'd just want to make sure simple things like:<br />* is pin 4 actually 0V like it should be after the first 22ms?<br />* is pin 3 high (8.2V) while the momentary button is pressed, and 0V later?<br />* do pins 1, 2, and 5 toggle when the momentary button are pressed?<br /><br />Everything here should be low enough bandwidth you could even get away with using a soundcard as a 'scope — just make sure that you include some overvoltage protection &amp; current limiting before plugging anything into your computer.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">Looks like I also have an bad 74'368 since I'm having trouble with the second controller, only A button works and it is read like A+B+Start+Left.<br /></div>That sounds more like the controller is damaged, than that the 74'368 is.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />1MΩ+47pF seems ridiculous, but if it's reliable, then sure, whatever: the 4013 is a CMOS part so has approximately no input current.<br /><br />In the Famicom, M2 and /RD4016 are combined to produce a signal that should be<br />* Driven high during not-M2 of a cycle when reading from $4016<br />* Driven low during M2 of a cycle when reading from $4016<br />* External weak pullup the rest of the time.<br /><br />In the NES, it tentatively looks like /RD4016 just goes directly to the controller jack instead.<br /><br />Tangent: this should mean that the DPCM controller glitch should cause only one bit deletion on NES decks, but multiple bit deletions on original HVC-001 Famicoms.

It's working just fine.<br />Thanks again for all the help!!  <img src="./images/smilies/Mfr_icon_homebrew.png" alt=":beer:" title="Beer" /> <br />Interesting, /OE2 goes to controller port and the buffer.<br />If I understood right, it's what enables the buffer.<br /><br />There's still an umpopulated part on the board.<br />Since it's plugged on the PPU it may be someting related to the composite video transcodification.<br />In this board I have an UM6528 PPU, the colors seem a little differen from the UM6548.<br />Or maybe it's the output circuit or board layout that gives diferent colors.<br /><br />It still have very noticeable jailbars... on the other clone I removed the video buffer form the board and soldered directly on the PPU, then used a coax I got from an old notebook wifi antenna. It's almost unoticiable now! <br />I found very strange that it has an audio and video output on the cartridge slot!!<br /><br />Many thanks man!!<br />You rock!!

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">If it works, it works.</div><br />Well, I have been testing it on the last 2 days and everything seems fine, so I'm leaving as-is.<br />Thanks  <img src="./images/smilies/Mfr_icon_homebrew.png" alt=":beer:" title="Beer" /> <br /><br />@l_oliveira<br />Thanks for the info. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":-)" title="Smile" /><br />Do you know someway to &quot;transcode&quot; the thing internally?<br />I don't think it's possible, since Playtronic, when launched the official NES console in Brazil, has added an daughterboard just to do this and don't use &quot;alternative&quot; parts.<br /><br />The Phantom System also has some unpopulated part on the motherboard. Could this be related to the transcodification?<br />Maybe the clone PPU had come on NTSC-M color system only at first and the project was originally made to use them.<br /><br />I have some doubts about the color systems... maybe I should open another thread?<br />I'm not sure about these system's differences. Is it only the color subcarrier frequency and the alternating phase generation?<br />I also have a transcoded MegaDrive that gets black and white, with messed colors in some games. I just can't find a way to fix it <img src="./images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" alt=":-(" title="Sad" /><br /><br />I have scanned a &quot;naked&quot; board (wich was really bad) of this clone.<br />It is <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B0OtMD7uFlqgWThnTzB1ME9NNnM" class="postlink">here</a> and <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B0OtMD7uFlqgdGlBVmhMN3BvV2c" class="postlink">here</a>.<br />If someone wish to try a educated guess of how the unpopulated part (the circuit around CI-10) should be I'll be very happy!<br />Thanks in advance!<br /><br />Edit: Looks like the main crystal's frequency is divided by 6 to get the color subcarrier. Is it?<br />If it's right, I only need a circuit to make the alternating phase generation.<br />How complicated would this be?

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />The unpopulated circuitry is meant to make a NTSC PPU work on PAL-M TVs by replacing just the color crystal with the 21.45666 one.<br /><br />That's what Playtronic NES units do. Legit Ricoh NTSC PPU and a &quot;correction&quot; circuit which changes the video to PAL.  Unfortunately the colors will be a little off with that transcodification method...<br /><br />Since your unit doesn't have the circuit you want to fit it with either a UM6548 PPU or keep your UM6528 PPU and install a NTSC clock crystal.<br /><br />I honestly prefer NTSC NES than PAL-M NES but that's me.  All of my TVs can accept NTSC signals.
