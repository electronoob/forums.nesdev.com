Defining my banks is starting to work well, now my code run at $E000 without issue.  <br /><br />I just found one interesting behavior though.  If I want some data at the beginning to be at $8000, Nintendulator reads the last bank I set in my config file.  In the case of FCEUltra, it takes the first one.<br /><br />My guess is that that I didn't init witch bank should be at $8000 when the game started in the reset vector and each emulator handle that behavior differently.  Is it the cause of my current issue?<br /><br />I will try to figure out how to switch banks during my lunch time and may update this message if I find the solution.  I read the wiki but still doesn't grasp the idea yet.

Great post Tokumaru! Thanks for the information.<br /><br />This give me some insight on how to approach the problem.  Of course, at the beginning my code will be terrible and won't be optimized for speed but the first goal is to make it work and write more 6502 code to gain experience. Then, I may be able to do some of the concept you talked about.<br /><br />I remember when I didn't know anything about nes coding, I read a little bit the super mario bros dissasembly and was wondering what was those table about, why did they made that.  Now I know why.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3559">Banshaku</a> — Sun Oct 05, 2008 8:47 pm</p><hr />

<div class="quotetitle">Banshaku wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"><br />How do people retreive the same type of data located in different banks? Since the final address may/will be different after the linker does it job, you cannot hard code that part.  How do people approach this problem?<br /></div><br />It really depends on the type of data you are reading. Some types of data will be more efficiently dealt with if they are in fact mapped to the exact same location. When they are not always in the same locations, you must use pointers to read them:<br /><br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">   ;setup the pointer<br />   lda #&lt;DataLabel<br />   sta DataPointer+0<br />   lda #&gt;DataLabel<br />   sta DataPointer+1<br /><br />   ;prepare the index register<br />   ldy #$00<br /><br />   ;read the data<br />   lda &#40;DataPointer&#41;, y</div><br />This is in fact not different at all from using pointers without bankswitching, except for the fact that you must be sure the bank is selected before attempting to read anything from it, but there is no difference in the actual reading.<br /><br />In a game, you will hardly do it as directly as I did above, because if you knew what label you wanted to read tou could simply do:<br /><br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">   ldy #$00<br />   lda DataLabel, y</div><br />So, as a more realistic example, say you have your level headers (information about the dimensions of the level, it's name, which tileset it uses, etc) scattered around at unpredictable locations. As long as you have a label for each one, you can build a table of pointer like this:<br /><br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">HeaderPointersLo:<br />   .db &lt;Level1Header, &lt;Level2Header, &lt;Level3Header, ...<br />HeaderPointersHi:<br />   .db &gt;Level1Header, &gt;Level2Header, &gt;Level3Header, ...</div><br />Through that table, each header can be identified by a number, and have a pointer prepared like this:<br /><br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">   ldy LevelIndex<br />   lda HeaderPointerLo, y<br />   sta Pointer+0<br />   lda HeaderPointerHi, y<br />   sta Pointer+1<br />   ldy #$00</div><br />Now you are ready to read the information contained in the header. If you have the headers scattered across multiple banks, be sure to define another table containing the indexes of the banks, so that you also switch in the correct bank using "LevelIndex" as an index.<br /><br />The disadvantage of using indirect indexed addressing (LDA (), Y) is that it's slower than normal indexed addressing. Not only the LDA instruction takes longer, but you have to increments the Y register for reading consecutive bytes. When the address is known, you can read consecutive bytes by adding the displacement to the base address at compile time (and it doesn't even have to be sequential):<br /><br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">   lda DataLabel+0, y<br />   &#40;...&#41;<br />   lda DataLabel+1, y<br />   &#40;...&#41;<br />   lda DataLabel+8, y<br />   &#40;...&#41;</div><br />Basically, speed is the reason you will want to keep certain things at fixed locations, such as metatile definitions. Since you have to read them pretty often, you will want to sacrifice some readability for speed. For example, in the case of metatiles, there are a lot of things you have to store about them: the indexes of the 4 tiles that compose them, the palette they use, their type and collision properties, etc. Instead of storing all of that information sequentially for each tile, it's much faster to make separate tables for each piece of information: One list with the indexes of all the top left tiles of all metatiles, then a list of indexes of all the top right tiles, and so on. When the data is organized like that, all the information about a specific metatile can be read with the same index (index of the metatile, 0 to 255) loaded into one of the index registers.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=95">tokumaru</a> — Sun Oct 05, 2008 4:26 pm</p><hr />

Interesting comments are flowing in the thread. Great stuff from everyone, I like it <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">tokumaru wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"><br />I wouldn't place the sound engine there though, because the sound engine is useless without the sound data, which means you'll have to switch the data anyway, so it might as well carry the code along with it, specially since sound is something executed at very predictable times (often once per frame, after the graphical updates made during VBlank).<br /></div><br /><br />I see your point put since the FT driver is at least 3k, to spread it in all banks that contains the music seems a little bit a waste of space. But that's from a beginner's point of view.<br /><br />What I would like to do is put some init/basic code in the main bank, the sound engine and stuff that doesn't change here.<br /><br />The real code and data of a specific level should be stored in another bank. So is the music and DPCM data.  There is good chance that the music and DPCM data will be in the same bank, which mean the one that will be loaded at $C000.<br /><br />What I don't know yet is how to retrieve the data once I switch bank. I can not define the same segment name in every bank so I have to figure out how that part works.  Always the same address to get the data?  That seems extreme, there must be an easier way.<br /><br />How do people retreive the same type of data located in different banks? Since the final address may/will be different after the linker does it job, you cannot hard code that part.  How do people approach this problem?<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3559">Banshaku</a> — Sun Oct 05, 2008 9:06 am</p><hr />

Yeah, well. Then you gotta pick one, you can't have everything, as the NES isn't exactly the most powerful game machine in the world. I was just suggesting how one could make more room for the stuff that absolutely needs to be mapped during the main engine, which can be quite a lot in complex games. If one uses DPCM, then DPCM is one of those things.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=95">tokumaru</a> — Sat Oct 04, 2008 6:04 pm</p><hr />

The sound engine could probably share a bank with sound effects and instruments, while actual music tracks would be in other banks, and mapped to the other area. After all, there is nothing else going on while the sound engine is running. After returning from the NMI, the main engine would simply switch back the banks with level maps, object placement and whatever (which vary according to the level). I think it's worth it, it saves a lot of space in the hardwired banks that you can use for the main engine, object routines, etc. Object routines can in fact need a lot of space, depending on how many of them are there and how intelligent they are.<br /><br />I have no music engine YET, but that's exactly what I plan to do when I make one. I need all the space I can get in the hardwired banks for object logic (even though one of the switchable areas is already reserved for code as well, for a total of 24KB of code for the game engine when outside of VBlank).<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=95">tokumaru</a> — Sat Oct 04, 2008 4:09 pm</p><hr />
