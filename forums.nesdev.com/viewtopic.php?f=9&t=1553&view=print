I usually cut the rom off with wire cutters, then take out the pins that were left, and finally use a solder sucker to suck out the remaining solder...but this is getting really old and is very time consuming.  is there an easier way?

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I have like the most basic desoldering pump ever. It cost me $7, and It's a manual pump with a thing you push down, then press this one button, and it acts like a really quick vacuum. It works just fine, but when you press down the thing again, you have to press it over somewhere where a bunch of solder dust can fall. I have no trouble with it. Takes me about 20 minutes to safely remove a chip without breaking pins/tearing IO lines. You don't need anything too pricy, you just need it to have a good vacuum force for like half a second.

<br />
<br />That's what I use too, and most of the times I'm able to get the ROM out in one piece. I'm kinda tired of that though, and am considering starting to cut the legs and calmly remove the pins one by one, as describe above.
<br />
<br />The regular pump way is a bit difficult in the end of the process, when some pins refuse to detach from the board, and you feel like you'll break the board with the force used to pull out the chip. Then you may even pull traces off.

<br />No, it's because you have to heat the solder up so much first that this weakens the adhesion of the nearby traces to the board. I need to try the heat gun/hair dryer approach mentioned in other threads.

I just wait till the tip is good and hot, suck a row of pins, and then let the tip warm up very quickly before continuing.  I'll usually suck each pin twice and I clear the tip by blowing on a piece of cardboard between suck.  It's slightly tedious, but it only takes a few minutes.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Desoldering braid. Copper wire braided together. Put this down on what you want to lift, apply a fine tip soldering iron and the braid absorbs and traps the solder. Just remove the braid with the iron or the braid will be soldered to the board. If that happens just apply the iron and lift together, no biggy.
<br />
<br />Works so much better then a sucker IMO. Just dont get the radioshack stuff. ITs useless, the braids are as loose as hookerbot 2000. The only downfall is its perishable. You have to keep buying it.

<br />
<br />Don't bother with heat gun.  It gives too much heat and will actually burn the PCB.  It will also cause other IC's next to the ROMs to fall out.  When the ROMs fall out, the through holes will still be sealed, and you still need to get the solder out.
<br />
<br />The only thing that works is either a really good desolder station (radio shack crap is as good as a 20$ solder.. works well for 5 PCBs but not 50+) order the hard way (clip ROMs and then use pump).
<br />
<br />Take it from a person who made over 100 boards.  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />

<br />
<br />I saw someone recommend a way to avoid this problem when using a heat gun.  Take a piece of aluminum foil and cut out a hole just large enough for the part your removing (ROM) to fit.  Place this over the board, apply heat.  The foil will act as a heat shield, protecting the other parts.  It's not a great shield, but it's enough to prevent damage.

The mask ROM's come off in perfect shape and the solder traces and holes are left in excellent shape with very little solder and ready for the EPROM sockets. You do have to make sure the tip is clean and tinned and have to apply the tip for a few seconds till the solder melts (it looks different-sort of liquidy) before sucking. I find it much better than the two suckers and braid that I also have.

<br />
<br />And yes, one suck usually does it, but I almost always do a quick two and then I hardly ever have to worry about a bitch pin.  With the second suck, I usually let the pin get in the hole and wiggle the pin so i know it's loose.
