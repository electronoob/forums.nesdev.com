		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Hey guys I just wanted to know if any of you here know an easier way to rip music data off of a NES Rom besides the 20 Levels of ripping steps? It seems to me that ripping music off NES games it takes you to be a Rocket Scientist to learn.And I was never really great in Math so I don't really know or remember anything about Hexidecimals.If someone can point me to the right directions with the right tools I would like to give it a try myself I seriously would like to learn how to create NSF files myself otherwise I don't want to waste time trying to learn something that I know I can't ever know unless the information is in an easier method.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />If, by the "20 levels", you are referring to Gil_Galad's document, none of us experienced NSF rippers really follow that guide - we just look through the game code (usually a trace dump) to find the main sound engine routines and then sort of figure out the rest from there.
<br />
<br />One of the main requirements is reasonably advanced knowledge of 6502 ASM, namely the ability to look at a routine in assembly and be able to recognize what it does at a high level. There isn't really an "easy" way to rip an NSF since all games work slightly differently (though most games written by a single company tend to follow patterns), so you effectively need to learn how to recognize patterns and single out the sound code from the rest of the game.

If you try to make them authentic(3 GG codes max), that forcibly limits you to changing 3 bytes of code to get the effect you want. If you can't, you abandon the search, but not without learning anything. It also provides actual results for you to see, and gives you an idea of how NES memory access works.
<br />
<br />Good for people who aren't naturally inclined towards seeing the bigger picture from the lines of assembly. It's also a case where it's a good idea to give up for a while when you get too taxed to complete the project. You can apply 'stick-to-itiveness' on the second or third assembly language you learn.

<br />You'll still need to learn how to make codes, but GG code making fits into NSF ripping like a hill fits into a mountain.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />The fact is this: You have to learn. If you don't try things, you won't learn. If you don't want to learn, then you're not likely to ever make a hand-ripped NSF. If you start small, you can get reduce the learning curve for when you try to jump to NSF ripping. If it's too hard for you, then remember to accept it when it's too much effort for someone else.
