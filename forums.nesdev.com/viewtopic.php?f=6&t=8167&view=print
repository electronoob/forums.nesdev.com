<br />
<br />I need to be able to switch DPCM samples (of 4081 bytes) after they've been played because I've hit the (according to famitracker) 16KB limit for samples.
<br />
<br />Would it be possible to replace samples on they fly (One second/ 50 or 60 frames depending) while still playing the song?
<br />
<br />If this matters, I've estimated the entirety of the song when it's finished to be about 681KB.  I know the max official PRG-ROM was 512KB, so would this be able to be made without some weird custom mapper?

<br />
<br />Didn't read the whole thread, but I think the basic gist is that you can have unlimited samples by saving each 16k of samples as an instrument, then loading the instruments in a new song. Don't know if the ftm can be compiled as an nsf, however. Also, I think this trick was eliminated in latest version 3.7.
<br />
<br />Another option is PPMCK, which has unlimited (?) bank-switching.

<br />
<br />Correct me if I'm wrong, but the limit of DPCM samples is only $0F?  I'm going to need ~$AC samples.  I also can't seem to find the note that would make the samples sound normal.
<br />
<br />------------------------
<br />
<br />Ok, what I'm trying to do is either do a raw port of a normal song that is 2m:51s and play it in the DPCM and add some sound channel accompanies, or remix the song in an editing program a bit, port it to DPCM samples and then add 8-bit parts to it.  The quality I've been able to achieve with famitracker's import option is that of vinyl records.
<br />
<br />I need to be able to make this all play on an NES normally, not just through a tracker program so I'm probably going to have to bankswitch the 4-second song clips together through some programming, unless there's a better option.
<br />
<br />Here's the test .nsf I made just to show kinda what I'm doing:

<br />
<br />(Play that in an accurate emulator like fceux, things like faulty WinAMP plugins and emulators like Jnes just don't cut it.  The samples are quiet for a reason, so turn your speakers up to hear it clearer.)

<br />Nope, you can have up to 255 instruments. I assume you're using the highest frequency, so to make them sound normal enter a note "-F-" (with key 7 in the default octave).

I'm going to need ~$AC samples.</div><br />By "limit" what do you mean? I'm not familiar with particular trackers, so I'll talk about the NES itself:<br /><strong>Length:</strong> The DMC sample length register is $00 through $FF, where the actual length of the waveform is 16*L+1 bytes or 128*L+1 samples.<br /><strong>Number of samples:</strong> Samples can start on any in $C000-$FFFF. With MMC3, FME-7, MMC5, or the NSF mapper, you'll usually be switching waveforms into $C000-$DFFF.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">I also can't seem to find the note that would make the samples sound normal.</div><br />What notes do you need? If you have a waveform of a sampled instrument, and you resample it to C = 16744 Hz, the NES can play it back at these pitches:<br />Octave 1: C, D, E, F, G, A, B<br />Octave 2: C, D, F, G, A<br />Octave 3: C, E, G<br />Octave 4: C<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">I need to be able to make this all play on an NES normally, not just through a tracker program so I'm probably going to have to bankswitch the 4-second song clips together through some programming</div>
<br />That's pretty much how you have to do it. Resample the whole thing to 33144 Hz, and play 32648-sample chunks of the waveform at $C000 and $D000. In this case, IRQ might be helpful to get perfectly gapless playback.

<br />Beware however that these pitches obtained aren't perfect pitched as despicted by my good ol' table of DPCM frequency/note : <a href="http://www.2a03.org/forum/viewtopic.php?id=924" class="postlink">http://www.2a03.org/forum/viewtopic.php?id=924</a>. With high-pitched notes it can get quite dissonant with the rest of the music.
