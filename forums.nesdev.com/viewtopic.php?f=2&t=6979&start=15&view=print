		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I would not say that Crystalis did not use any compression.  Just that they did not use RLE for converting areas to meta-tiles.  
<br />
<br />This is all that I have left of my Crystalis hacking tools.  I had posted them to Zophar's domain years ago, but they garnered little interest.  The C code compiles into several tools.  One is a map dumper.  Another tool is a disassembler that disassembles the rom, merging it with comments stored in text files.  I lost most of those files.  Another tool fixes the checksum in a saved game file, making it easier to hack saved games.  I don't remember what the other tools do.
<br />
<br />At the time my goal in disassembling Crystalis was to create a map and/or full-game editor, not understand how it implemented scrolling or player physics.  I gave up when I discovered that most event trigger in the game are custom code and not table driven.  It is fairly easy to modify the map.  Tedious but easy.  However, changing the story looked to be much more complicated than I was willing to deal with.

<br />
<br />
<br />Yeah, I was considering that too. A subroutine for special stuff that happens and it is all custom code, that might be how it runs too. Just JSR's to a text-updater, JSR's to button inputt and cursor movement, if not answer 1, close text box and increment special stuff counter or else give sword or something like that. I don't know any other way that could be done so yeah... <img src="./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" />
<br />
<br />
<br />I am not much into hacking or reverse engineering, but I will probably give these tools a whirl some time. Crystalis is so amazing. Its hard to believe you got mostly through the code....phew! That makes me tired. XD

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Personally I'm very opposed to screen re-use. I find it completely lame and cheap, and make games much less enjoyable.
<br />In some cases when it is done on purpose (for mazes) it is ok, but games that uses it all the time are indecent.
<br />
<br />I belive a good way to make any compression sheme pseudo-random is to compress every line/column of metatiles or screens (whathever you like the best) separately and have pointers at each of them. Note that you can have a pointer to each "screen" for compression purpose, without re-using screens at all (or not much). I do this in my game which obviously does screen-based scrolling, but it would work in a game that does random scrolling and that has memory for 4 screens (however, it would have to load them while scrolling which might be terribly slow and/or complex).
