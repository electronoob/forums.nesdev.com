		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />After having someone post a 74 style MMC1 shematic for the NES, I trough I could come with something similar. After someone stated sound would nothing fit any simple programmable loigc chip in another thread, I came up with a sawtooth generator wich use no more than one 74HC160, three 74HC161, one op-amp and 11 resistors. It looks terrible because I've just rushed on it, but I think it's usable. You could control this channel with 8-bits for frequency, and one bit to enable/disable the channel. A frequency of $ff would mean 11.8 kHz, and a frequency of $00 would mean 43.7 Hz. The formula is just ( 1/(179*16*Value) = Frequency)
<br />
<br />It's just a divider per 10 (because 1.7 MHz is too high, and I found 170k as a base of timing would be just right), then two daisy-chained 4-bits syncronous counters, wich are presettable by the programm. A high value mean they will fastly overflow, so high frequency. Then you have an actual counter wich create a frequency variable sawtooth and that outputs to a small hand-made 4bit DAC. Oh, I just forgot to add some logic to re-trigger the pre-scale counters. I'm just supid, but I want to improve this and come with something much much better until a few time if people is interested.
<br />
<br />It's a very primary thing, but it could fit a few macrocells (?) in a programmable logic chip, and would require quite a few external componants (only the 74HCxxx could be inside as I understand things).

<br />The ability to solder together a mapper is allegedly "already available to you".
<br />
<br />Bregalad: Is there a reason that you started out with a divide by 10 counter instead of a divide by 16? Wouldn't a divide by 16 let the program use the same note period tables as with the built-in channels?

<br />I'm sorry if my english abilities form some kind of a "language barrier" here (or maybe I'm just expressing myself poorly), but basically what I mean is: to me, as a NES-developer, it is more important to develop using the hardware that was present at the time NES was actively used, than to develop new hardware to exceed the limitations of the original.
<br />
<br />I understand why it would be "fun" to develop such hardware, but I don't see why'd you want to associate it with NES.

But it's also pretty cool to come up with interesting expansions, as <em>Lagrange Point</em> and <em>Akumajou Densetsu</em> proved. And as tepples pointed out, the huge majority of NES games use more than what's available by default.
<br />
<br />So yeah, it's definitely cool to push the limits, but that doesn't mean there's no reason to expand the limits.

<br />I don't see your point here. The feature in question is the cartridge connector (and the FC connector has sound expension, and the NES one can easily be modified to have). I see no reason to be against creating new carts and systems. Sure it's nothing needed, but it's fun and have its geek factor.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I bet the idea of putting a battery on RAM (in Zelda, first ever game to do that) seemed pretty innovative at the time, look how well that turned out.
<br />
<br />But yeah, all these pins on the NES connector are a hardware hacker's playground.  If some of the designs seem like overkill, it's mostly because we've got new and cheaper technology.. literally to the point where the parts for doing it the old way could cost as much (if not more).  Unless you mean NROM, that's always cheap and easy. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />
<br />
<br />Bregalad: Pretty nice, fairly simple.  A sawtooth with no volume control is a very piercing sound though, about the opposite of the (step) triangle.  Putting a DAC on a cart though is a very Famicom-ish thing to do, I mean even if you attach an audio cable to be mixed with the NES's output it's still gonna leave top-loading NES's out in the cold or at least make the hookup very awkward (they almost always only have RF out).
<br />
<br />I still prefer the Squeedo DSP method, playing samples though $4011 right through the NES's regular audio path.  Though you could do the same thing with your sound generator, with a bit more complexity.
<br />
<br />Also, if just one sawtooth wave is enough, there's always Blargg's awesome DMC sawtooth trick (which does have volume control).

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I think other waves could be not so hard to do. A square wave wouldn't require any DAC, just a transistor to buffer a TTL output (because it would be bad to directly connect the TTL output to the sound pin). Note that my shematic won't work, you need 2 more 4-bits D flip-flops on the inputs of the freqency counters, plus some logic that re-triggers those counters when the sawtooth counter overflows. You could just XOR the low 3 bits with the higher bit to get a 8-step triangle wave, and it would require an additional chip, but less resistors for a 3-bit DAC. It would sound similar but a lot more distorted than the NES' triangle wave.

<br />Maybe so. I haven't checked exactly. If that's the case, definitely a divider by 16 would be better.
<br />
<br />EDIT : It would also be interesting to create analog-based sound generators. This shouldn't be too complicated, but to get precision in frequency it is. Typically, with an operationnal amplifier with a capacity between the inverted input and the output, you can charge it lineary and get a linear voltage on the ouput. I think you could detect when the voltage approach the power voltage and revert the voltage on the input of the operationnal amplifier to discharge the capacity lineary. A JFET transistor could simulate a variable resistor on the input of the operational amplifier to get a variable frequency. The oupout would be a non-distorted triangle wave. It also require few componant. However, a 8-bit DAC would be needed to control the JFET transisor, and I think the frequency would be atrociously detuned in the best case, due to the imprecision of the transistor and of the capacity.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Okay, the first one was bad, I admit. I figured out not only my shematic won't work at all, but also a sawtooth wave isn't really the nicer thing to hear. 
<br />
<br />A much nicer thing to hear is pulse-width moduled rectangle wave. I've made a generator with 74HC series wich has 8-bit frequcency control that is supposed to be compatible with the one of the NES's triangle wave channels (and one octave lower than the NES's square channels). It can only play higher notes unfortunately but it shouldn't be too hard to modify it to support 12-bit frequency. It requires quite a lot of circuits but leaves a lot of free gates for decoding/bankswtiching logic. It could also easily fit a part of a programmable logic chip, requiring only one transisor and two resistors external to 74HC logic. The pulse-width is supposed to be modified automatically and periodically (by the 74HC4040 chip). After a 8-bit frequency down counter (because up counters aren't compatible with internal NES channels), a counter is made up with some logic. When an impulse is get from the freqency counter, this one will either increase or decrease. When it will have termined to increase/decrease, some logic is put together to have it re-load it with the duty cycle value, and change its mode (so if it was decreasing, it will be increasing, and vice-versa). This makes the time of both increasing and decreasing constant. The increase/decrease output is just put on a buffer transistor to the audio pin. Some additional analog stuff could be put here to get volume control.
