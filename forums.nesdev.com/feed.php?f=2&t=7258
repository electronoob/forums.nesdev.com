Well, animal crossing was just a thought and I agree, too hard. But a indie game on 360 called Miner Dig Deep would be so much better to happen.

Animal Crossing clone on NES? <a href="http://www.pineight.com/mw/index.php?title=Animal_Crossing_%28NES_game%29" class="postlink">I've investigated it</a>.<br /><br />The huge 64x64-tile map of Animal Crossing: Wild World is actually rawther sparse, and they could be compressed into fewer than 3000 bytes as long as the player doesn't litter. The key is to store things as 3-byte records consisting of x (4 bits), y (4 bits), and item id (16 bits), and possibly give trees and flowers shorter codes. Allow up to 32 things in an acre (1536 bytes), 32 things in each room of the players' house (480 bytes), and 16 things in each of eight NPC neighbors' houses (384 bytes).<br /><br />What really takes up space in AC are the letters. Each player in the GCN/DS/Wii games can hold ten letters, each NPC neighbor can hold one, the town hall's outbox and the players' house's inbox hold several more, and compressing them with a static Huffman table isn't likely to guarantee keeping them below 128 bytes each.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=9">tepples</a> — Mon Dec 13, 2010 4:03 pm</p><hr />

I can't imagine that Rare would have programmed Pin*Bot and High Speed using that weird mapper if they didn't need to.  I don't know how they used the CHR-ROM/RAM switch exactly, but I thought those those games were pretty good, myself.  Maybe I'm biased because I used to play a Pin*Bot machine that was down the street from me when I was young.  Porting a real pinball table to an NES game and having it look decent would not be easy to do, in fact I can't think of ANY other examples from other consoles that tried to port a 'real' pinball table.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=10">Memblers</a> — Mon Dec 13, 2010 3:52 pm</p><hr />

Me too. It'd be great for storing one huge map, like on Animal Crossing, and just have stuff happen over time. But it was just a cool idea.

Allowing both CHR ROM and CHR RAM on a board is more a function of the board than the mapper, unless the mapper IC includes one or more built-in banks of CHR ROM. I seem to remember that one of the Chinese MMC3 clones has this. The biggest problem with TQROM is the limitation to 128 KiB PRG ROM.<br /><br /><a href="http://bootgod.dyndns.org:7777/profile.php?id=2260" class="postlink">Mapper 77</a>: If only "Senki" were "Dynamite".

I don't know about you guys but I get mad when I see mappers with cool possibilities which are only used by very, very crappy games.<br />This includes :<br /><br />- CPROM / mapper 13 : OK it's one of the only mapper able to bankswitch CHR-RAM (alongside with mapper 96), and the only cart that uses it isn't even a video game but just allow you to draw on the screen. What a waste. There is so much better things you could do with bankswitched CHR-RAM. But with only 32k of ROM this is pretty limitating.<br /><br />- TQROM / mapper 119 : This is one of the only mapper able to use both  CHR-RAM and CHR-ROM. Again you could do amazing stuff with this, taking advantage of both, with some very customizable tiles (RAM) and some fast switching tiles (ROM), however, the only 2 games using this are crappy pinball games that doesn't take any advantage of this. Even a bigger waste than above.<br /><br />- Mapper 77 : This is the other mapper that support both CHR-RAM and CHR-ROM, and I love how it wastes nothing, the area of CHR-RAM which is "eaten" by the CHR-ROM portion is re-used in another adress range to get 4-screen mirroring. Like mapper 119 you could have the advantage of CHR-ROM and RAM at the same time, plus the advantage of 4 nametables.<br />Too bad the only game to use this mapper is incredibly crappy.<br /><br />- SXROM (mapper 1) : 32 KB of battery backed RAM could be used for more complex games than only 8 KB. However this was just used for multicarts. (applies to mapper 5 too)<br /><br />Maybe I forgot a few of them.<br />So yeah someone MUST do games or demo taking advantage of these mappers that were in my opinion wasted.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=38">Bregalad</a> — Sat Dec 11, 2010 3:31 am</p><hr />
