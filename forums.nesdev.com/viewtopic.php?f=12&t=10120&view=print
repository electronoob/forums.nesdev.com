		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Hey, I'm starting to develop a rudimentary flashcart for my dev needs, and was wondering on some solutions.<br />My idea is simple, just a flash memory and sram for saving(there will be need for bus level shifting etc), nothing more, nothing less. The programmer would be a cheap stm32 mcu programming the cart via the edge connector, via usb. Only one game would be allowed at a time to be on the flashcart (so no menus etc). <br />- can the MAD-1 be ignored, if the microcontroller flashes the memory accordingly depending on hirom/lorom flag contained in the rom?<br />- can the CIC be ignored in my design, if i'd like to try running commercial games? The programmer again, could overwrite/disable the region information contained in the original rom.<br />My goal is really the simplest design, while retaining almost full functionality.<br /><br />Cheers!

You can replace the MAD-1 with discrete logic or a CPLD though assuming you're looking to use all new parts.  If you were looking to make a ROM only cart I think you could do it though, but that takes away a lot of functionality/compadable games.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />You need to realize the CIC is a KEY chip. It's totally unconnected to the Software on the ROM chip. The CIC in the console is a LOCK chip. So all that must happen is the console must be unlocked by a matching CIC in the cartridge.<br /><br />The software/game doesn't know what CIC you are using, or if you even have one at all. So again, all you need is a CIC, original or cloned, on the PCB with the connections correct. You can run any region game you want to, the CIC doesn't matter in that case. However games can check NTSC/PAL console via a register flag. This again is unrelated to the CIC.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />A standalone cart dumper would ONLY need to care about the CIC if you wanted to dump SA-1 games.  As Mottzilla said, the purpose of the CIC is to unlock the CONSOLE by inserting a game containing a valid CIC (key).  If you're building your own dumper/flasher, it will be unlocked by default (because you won't be building a lock), and you don't care about the CIC.  However, if you're making your own cart, then yes, the cart will need a valid CIC in order to run on the console.  As for the decoder, I'm still figuring that out piece by piece myself, so I can explain the concept, but not the specifics.  The MAD-1 is just a decoder combined with a battery-power management circuit.  The decoder is used to control the RAM /CS signal and the ROM /OE signal.  You'll have to read up on the SNES cart memory maps and figure out what logic is necessary to drive those signals based on whatever decoder you use.  Some official boards use the 74LS139 instead of the MAD-1, but they have a bunch of extra discrete components for the battery-power circuit, and they only support a maximum of 16Mbit.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />That's right, there is no reason to use any old parts when making new SNES cartridges now. You can use a new pcb, new cartridge shell, new CIC, new ROM chips. The same could be done for NES or Sega Genesis. N64 still requires donor CICs. But if someone every reverse engineers the most common CIC then new cartridges could be made without using old game parts. Someone would still have to manufacture a plastic shell but it could be done.
