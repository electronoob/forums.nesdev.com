Awesome!  Thanks again for your generous help tokumaru, tepples, memblers, and jaffe.  This site is awesome!<br /><br />Also tokumaru, I'm downloading fceuxd from zophar right now.  FCE Ultra has long been one of my favorite NES emulators, but I haven't had a reason to check out this debugger version until now.  The more I learn from the Diskin's NES doc and from the forum here, the more I finally understand what's meant by pattern tables and all the other elusive stuff I see on the emulators' debug screens.

It's really cool to now know what exactly causes that.

And background tiles would basically be everything else.<br /></div><br />Yeah, kinda. Strictly speaking, the background is a grid of tiles of a fixed size, while sprites are movable entities that can be placed anywhere on the screen. Typically, sprites are used to represent characters, because they can move around freely, but some game objects might be represented with background tiles if there is a good reason for it (this is true for the NES, but almost never happens on systems that can display more sprites per scanline, like the SNES or the Mega Drive/Genesis).<br /><br />Sprites can also be used to fake background elements, like when you need more colors than the background alone can provide or when these elements need some sort animation that's hard to pull off with background tiles.<br /><br />It's all about creative use of the few resources you have.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"><br />In otherwords, if the same sprite is repeated on one scanline but at a different x position, the PPU could handle it.  Is that correct?<br /></div><br />No, it's 8 sprites, period. It doesn't matter if they use the same graphics.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"><br />For instance, in Galaga you have all the little spaceships moving around at the top of the screen, but they're also the same tiles repeated over and over again on the same horizontal line.<br /></div><br />Galaga is a good example of creative use of sprites and background. Note that the "background" is all black, and that there are only a few starts going by. What happens is that the game is using sprites to simulate a background. The stars are sprites, while the background itself is fully black. When the enemy ships move in, they do it in a circular pattern in order to avoid hitting the sprite limit. When they finally line up, the game stops using sprites and starts using the background to draw them. The player can't tell the difference, and that's the beauty of it.<br /><br />I recommend you grab a copy of the FCEUXD emulator, and use it's debugging features to understand a bit of how the games do their magic. Open Galaga in it and select Tools -&gt; Name Table Viewer. The name table is the background, and whatever you see in it is drawn with background tiles, and whatever isn't there is drawn with sprites. Play around with different games and different debugging features and you'll learn a lot.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"><br />And does that mean (though I think I know the answer to this) that background tiles on the NES can be animated?  Ex. the waterfall in the Bubbleman stage in Mega Man 2?<br /></div><br />There are 3 ways to achieve a waterfall effect, I don't know which one this game uses, but it's surely on of them:<br /><br />The easiest is to rotate the palette that contains the water colors. This will make the waterfall seem to be moving, but in fact the graphics don't change, just the colors change. The disadvantage is that nothing else can use the same palette, or the colors would change there too.<br /><br />Another method is to modify the name table, overwriting the old tiles with the new tiles. This isn't done often, because overwriting tiles can be a very slow process since waterfalls can occupy very large areas of the screen.<br /><br />Another common method is overwriting the graphics of the tiles. When you modify a certain tile, all instances of it on the whole screen will automatically show the changes. This is often used in games that can bankswitch CHR-ROM, because it takes very little time to switch graphics in that case. Some games with CHR-RAM also use this method, but they have to change the graphics of the tiles byte by byte, which is much slower.<br /><br />Again, i recommend you look at some games using FCEUXD. Go to Tools -&gt; PPU viewer and you can see how the palettes and tiles change in real time. Look at the Mega Man waterfall you mentioned and I'm sure you're gonna figure out the trick they used.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=95">tokumaru</a> — Thu Feb 11, 2010 11:19 am</p><hr />

Your understanding of a scanline is fine.<br /><br />It sounds like you may have the background confused with the sprites.  With a still screenshot it's not always obvious which tiles are background and which are sprites.  Sometimes they can use the same set of tiles.  Like a tetris block hitting the ground, changes from a sprite to background.  There are 64 sprites that can be put anywhere, but the PPU doesn't have enough memory to display them all at once (on the current line).  The background of course is a separate layer and covers the whole screen.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=10">Memblers</a> — Wed Feb 10, 2010 6:12 pm</p><hr />

This is a complex process, that involves checking all background tiles that are supposed to be displayed and what palette they should use, reading the graphics of said tiles and coloring them... and also calculating which sprites have visible parts in that scanline.<br /><br />Every scanline the NES checks the Y coordinate of all 64 sprites looking for the ones that are visible in the current scanline. When it finds them, their graphics have to be fetched and colored. This takes time, and the video processor in the NES only has time to do this for 8 sprites. This is why after it finds 8, it stops looking, as there is no time to draw more than that.<br /><br />The programmer can place more than 8 of them in the same scanline, but the ones with lower priority will just not show up, because the NES favors the ones with high priority.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"><br />Perhaps there's some trick I'm not aware of?<br /></div><br />The only "trick" used is called sprite cycling. Since the sprites with lower priority are dropped, games usually randomize the priorities of the individual sprites every frame, so that a sprite that was dropped in one frame is displayed on the next. This causes sprites to flicker (sometimes they may look transparent) when there are more than 8 sharing the same scanlines, but the player can still recognize the objects and know where they are.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"><br />Or perhaps extra hardware on the cartridges allows there to be more?<br /></div><br />This limitation can't be bent with cartridge hardware, since all the sprite logic is internal to the PPU.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"><br />Perhaps I'm not looking at the my these screenshots correctly?<br /></div><br />Maybe you are mistaking background tiles for sprites or you are looking at screenshots from emulators that disabled the sprite limit, like I said above.<br /><br />If you have more questions, keep them coming. =)<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=95">tokumaru</a> — Wed Feb 10, 2010 6:12 pm</p><hr />

Hello,<br /><br />I'm confused on the very principle of what's meant by "scanlines."  I think part of my problem is I come from a video background rather than a computer science background, so when I read "scanline" I've been envisioning something similar to a "scan line" on a CRT screen.  In other words, for the NES I'm envisioning a horizontal scanline being a line of pixels 1 pixel high by 256 pixels wide, and there would be 240 of these sequentially layered top to bottom of the screen.<br /><br />However, the more I read the more I'm starting to think it's something a bit different.  Mostly, it's the "8 sprites per scanline at one time" rule that's really throwing me.  I understand that each sprite is 8x8 pixels (or, rarely, might be 8x16).  But as I look at screenshots of various NES games, it seems there are way more than 8 different sprites on the same line, even counting the many that get repeated.<br /><br />Again, my first conclusion is that I do not properly understand what a scanline is taken in the context of the NES display output.  But if I do, could someone please tell me what I'm missing with the "8 sprites per scanline rule"?  Perhaps there's some trick I'm not aware of?  Or perhaps extra hardware on the cartridges allows there to be more?  Perhaps I'm not looking at the my these screenshots correctly?<br /><br />I'm reading Patrick Deskin's NES System Doc and these forums and just barely getting my feel wet (as everyone can tell).  I haven't found a thread discussing a basic definition of scanlines yet but if there is one 1. I apologize and 2. please point me to it.<br /><br />And thanks folks for what you do on this site.  It's all really fascinating.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=4230">bigjt_2</a> — Wed Feb 10, 2010 5:35 pm</p><hr />
