		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />The 16 codes means there are 16 streams of never ending, never repeating data.  We have no idea how long in bits or time one transfer is.  We also dont know if the bits represent values.  The protocol could be running a timer and counting the clocks between high bits.  The 16 rows in the second transactions picture are just a small section of each of the 16 possible streams.  I think they are arranged logically so stream 0 is first, then stream 1, then stream 2, etc.
<br />
<br />On the pictures: a line up means 5 volts, logic 1.  Line down means 0 volts, logic 0.  The numbers at the top (-600uS, 300uS, etc) are the time scale, relative to the center of the screen.  We dont know how fast the bit rate is, so 600uS != 600 bits.  Any number with a T in it (T, T+676uS, T+2.8mS, etc) is relative to the trigger, which in this case is the beginning of the sync pulse.  This shows in the second transaction picture that everything is happening ~2.5mS after the sync pulse.
<br />
<br />The bit transfers are slightly shifted, with the nes cic sending before the cart cic sends.  You can see them shifted 1-2 pixels which is probably 1-2 clock cycles.  Most likely the nes cic sends then receives, the cart cic receives then sends
<br />
<br />The logic analyzer runs at up to 500MHz, I usually use 100MHz which very easily captures everything accurately.  The pictures are just screenshots so its not easy to get long sequences.  I can also save state transition tables but I do not know of a good program to view those.  It would help lots, anyone know of one?  Sample state transition table:  <a href="http://www.nesmuseum.com/10nes/10nes.csv" class="postlink">10nes.csv</a>
<br />
<br />Just to make this post even longer, here is a bit more information about the initial transaction.  One of the bits in the stream select triggers the first bit received from the cart.  I dont remember which stream bit it was tho...  Here is a <a href="http://www.nesmuseum.com/images/10nes2.png" class="postlink">picture</a> with some stuff circled.  All other bits are always the same until the reset line goes high.  Once again ignore the clock in the picture.

<br />Could you go down to 32 MHz or 16 MHz for some captures so that you can get more data at once while still appreciably oversampling to remove aliasing artifacts? Does your analyzer support synchronizing to a multiple of the CIC clock, or must it always run asynchronously?

<br />
<br />When I run the analyzer fast I have compression which means only state transitions are stored.  Number of transitions is the limit, not time (which is why I dont capture the clock signal).  I havent played with other modes but I should be able to capture everything for long periods of time.  The parallel port to control clock signal would probably be better at that tho.
<br />
<br />I can do synchronous but only on transitions of one direction and I think important stuff happens on rising and falling edges of the clock.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I really want to get theese things hooked up to a Parallel port. I'll try to do it this weekend. Anybody prefer I store the data a certian way?
<br />I was thinking of just making a list of numbers the first number is how many clock cycles low, then keep alternating back and forth. This would greatly reduce the file size and I would think be pretty easy to analize. It would look like this: 1,2,4,1 would represent LHHLLLLH. L and H being low and high respectively.
<br />
<br />I like bunnyboys approach to how this thing works. I was thinking it probably counts the clock cycles to hold Dout low too. Also perhaps the meaningfull data is simply the next random number.  It could alternate between using the random number to output clock cycles and then it takes the next random number and just sends it's value serially. Just a guess though.
<br />
<br />If it does generate random numbers then it's possible the Lock sends the seed as it's method of stream selection.  I hope this is the case, cause then we can simulate a lock chip and send it different seeds. Sending all zeros for a seed would show us if any of the bits are ORed or XORed. All ones could reveal possible AND and XOR instructions. If anyone's intrested in using the parallel port to gather info, but doesn't have the low level digital electronics knowledge to set it up let me know and I will post my schematics and the source code too, as soon as I get it working good.

<br />
<br />Use something that isn't so fragile. How about the format of the logs posted, where they are composed of state snapshots with the delays between them?
<br />
<br />As for the algorithm, it could be quite complex and not at all simple to understand. As long as it's deterministic, they could just throw random code together with some design. They were smart to have the devices share very little data. What might help is to systematically reason about things the chips must be doing, and things they can't be doing. That will clearly outline the limits of theories.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I tried to get my parallel port to log the CIC in action but had no luck. Not sure what the problem is. I'm sure I'll get it right eventually. Or maybe I'll just do what Kevin suggested and break out a FPGA.
<br />
<br />While messing with the CIC logger I was trying to make, I got an idea on another way to beat this system. When no cart is in the NES, the system isn't in reset the whole time. If we could disrupt the clock signal going to the Lock while the system is on, the lock won't be able to function and the NES will stay on. Ofcourse for this to work it would require messing the clock signal up enough to halt the MPU in the lock. But at the same time it can't damage the oscillator. Would this be possible?
<br />
<br />I got it to work on the bread board pretty easily by just removing the clock signal wire. Anybody know a good way to stop the clock without damage? I have no problem with testing this on one of my nintendos, worst case scenario I have to remove the CIC altogether.

<br />I think you'll need to wire the pin to VCC, not just cut it. Cut it on the NES PCB has the effect to tie it to GND, for some reason. But it won't be the same between 2 game paqs. And yeah, that is a great idea, because there is no NES invoved, and this avoid lots of problems, such as risk to damage the console or mecanical issues.
