I know my comment will not be constructive and not really related 100% to this thread but it's more of a personal comment about the 3DS in general.<br /><br />I tried many samples today at a game store.  Resident Evil Mercenaries, Zelda OOT, One Piece, Fire fox. I tried all of them with either 3D or not.  Except for the weird feeling that it gives you after a while to your vision, it didn't bring much at all to the game experience. Activating the 3D or disabling it was not much different in both case.  There was no wow factor.<br /><br />They took a risk and it was a flop. Now they have to drop the price.  We're still too far for anything interesting with 3D yet.  I'm waiting for anything better than that.  It's just a supped up DS with a flacky 3D screen.<br /><br />Sorry to hi-jack the thread. Maybe we I should have started another thread instead.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3559">Banshaku</a> — Sun Jul 31, 2011 8:34 am</p><hr />

With "zzz" we could select one of 8 planes, which should be enough for some interesting effects. There must also be a way to indicate what plane the background is on, and this setting should be modifiable during rendering, for some really cool raster effects.<br /><br />It would also be a good idea to be able to specify the absolute distance of each of the 8 planes, so that objects could move more smoothly in the Z axis instead of "jumping" from one plane to the next.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=95">tokumaru</a> — Sun Jul 31, 2011 6:42 am</p><hr />

Anything with a 3D projection like Rad Racer or World Runner could fairly easily be ported like this by having the emulated NES generate alternating left and right eye views and then displaying both in 30 fps. Super NES games would be even easier: assign each emulated layer a distance value.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=9">tepples</a> — Fri Jul 29, 2011 10:31 am</p><hr />

Thanks for the explanation, tokumaru!<br /><br />I knew that there would be nothing automatic about this, but thought that perhaps some kind of simple 3D-effect could be applied somewhat easily (in theory only.)<br />I've never been one to care for such 3D-effects, but after today I can see that it's more than just a gimmick.  Better have to search it up and see if I can't learn a little<br /> about it. :-)<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3727">dr_sloppy</a> — Fri Jul 29, 2011 10:20 am</p><hr />

It's like this guy that showed up here saying that his NES emulator would display games in red-blue 3D. Most of these old games don't have any depth information, and the few ones that do don't use a unified format, so there's no way to automatically create 3D images from 2D games.<br /><br />Conversion to 3D is a game-per-game task, where you have to associate a depth to every on-screen element and use that information to generate 2 2D views slightly displaced from each other. Then you can present these 2 images in various ways (red/blue glasses, polarized glasses, special screens, etc.) that allow peoples' brains to join the 2 images into 1 3D image.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=95">tokumaru</a> — Fri Jul 29, 2011 9:54 am</p><hr />

I mean I'd like them to keep remaking NES (or SuperNES) games in 3D because it adds more value to the traditional virtual console game which is nothing more than a ROM and emulator. But also I notice on the Virtual Console that they only seem to offer Gameboy and Gameboy Color games on the 3DS and Console games on the Wii. I would like it if they would offer games for all systems on both Virtual consoles. For example Gameboy games on the Wii's virtual console and NES, SNES and Genesis games etc. on the 3DS virtual console. <br /><br />Also for some reason paying to download a Super Metroid rom on my Wii seems more worth the money to me than paying to download a Super Mario Land rom on my 3DS. But if I could play Super Mario Land 2 on my Wii I might download that.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=493">Super-Hampster</a> — Mon Jul 25, 2011 12:39 am</p><hr />

I hope it's the first of many classic games on the 3ds shop for download that has been rewritten to be 3D. It adds a bit more value to the download then just letting me download unmodified Game Boy roms on an emulator. I see how they want to keep the 3ds virtual console all portable games, and the Wii personal console all console games, but I do wish they'd mix both. I'd like to see the GB games on the Wii's virtual console, and the console games on the 3DS virtual console.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=493">Super-Hampster</a> — Mon Jul 18, 2011 12:14 am</p><hr />
