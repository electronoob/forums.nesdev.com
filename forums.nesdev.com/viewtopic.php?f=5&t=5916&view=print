<br />
<br />I guess you want one for your editor, right? If it's for the family basic... I didn't find it that useful for that.
<br />
<br />Edit:
<br />
<br />Just want to say that I really don't like the form factor thought (i.e. layout and size of key sucks).

<br />
<br />There's no WAY i'm paying $200 but that's what price 3 of them are listed for on Ebay (actually, one is $250!).
<br />
<br />If you could find one that would be truly, truly outstanding! <img src="./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" />
<br />
<br />Yes, want to see what can be done with it and perhaps try to support it in my tracker.
<br />
<br />It's either that or try that Famiclone built-into-a-keyboard thing that I linked to. Can get one for Â£49 but not sure if it's PowerPak compatible (probably not).

It didn't look that mint for color too. it depends in what state you're looking for it.
<br />
<br />If I have a chance this week, I will check to see if they sell it in Tokyo but I don't remember seeing any at the usual stores I go.

<br />I checked the auction sites and in general the price goes around 40$/50$.  If more than that you're paying too much. If I find one I will let you know.

<br />
<br />It also looks like it shouldn't be too bad to mod a dead PC keyboard into one -- the only ICs are going to be four CD4021s and one CD4019. Although it's going to be an Awful Lot of wiring.

<br />
<br />Probably? I have a thought as to how I'd fake the not-actually-card-edge connector needed there, but haven't invested any serious effort into it.
<br />
<br />(I'd also need to buy a powerpak first)
