<br />
<br />Is /OE the same as /RD?
<br />
<br />So in the diagram, do I have the /CE and /OE connections on the LS139 mixed up?

<br />
<br />If you're using something other than a 74LS139, you should tie 139 pins 13,14,15 to +5V as well.
<br />
<br />Lastly ROM /CE should be taken from the mask ROM /CE pin hole, because that pin's function never changes, the MAD-1 pins do depending on the board.
<br />
<br />If your 245 chips are 74LS, you can tie the EPROM's /CE to 139 pin 1 as well to save a little power.

<br />
<br />"For the record, I tied pin 1 of the 139 to pin 4 of the MAD-1. Works like a charm!"
<br />
<br />There is no way that can be right... Pin 1 is /CE the MAD-1 Pin 4 links to /OE on HiRom Carts and is not used on LoRom Carts ( I mean the pin 4, not the mad-1 in total ). I even checked with a multimeter, pin 33 on the maskrom (/OE) leads to Mad-1 Pin 4.

<br />Your "corrected" schematic is horribly confusing. Go with the schematic kyuusaku posted (and I quoted) earlier. That'll work. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />

<br />
<br />edit: my left 3 diagrams of the ICs are the exact same as kyuusaku's. But I did ground and add the +5 connections to the legs not listed (10 is a ground and 20 is a +5V on the 245, and 8 is a gnd while 16 is a +5V on the 139).
<br />
<br />Is that correct?
<br />
<br />Pin 1 of the 139 is connected to the /CE of the maskrom pin 24, and pin 3 is connected to the /OE (pin 33 of the maskrom).
<br />
<br />If both of that is right, I will try editing my VCC and ground such that they all come from seperate wires, because right now, its 1 to the 139, and then they branch out from there for gnd and vcc.

<br />
<br />I checked that, it is wired correctly 100%. I have everything wired as per the diagram I posted above, if that is correct, then my problem lies with my rom or ICs.

<br />I just took the 27c322 out and re-read it... for some reason one of the hex's was wrong.. I had tape on the window by the way. 
<br />
<br />Willems programmers are a piece of crap lol. 25 degrees celsius, 12.0V VPP, 6.2V VCC +/- 0.25V (I get 0.64 V). Right off the datasheet and these specifications will not work for me with correct jumper settings <img src="./images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" alt=":(" title="Sad" />... grrr

MCUMall sells newer USB (no jumpers) programmers and they have 16bit adapters for chips like 27c322. Ofcourse they are more expensive than the average junk willem clone that is parallel port with jumpers and dip switches.

<br />
<br />no sir, i use the willem software, all i do is select 27c322 and change the jumper settings to what it is listed as + 6.2vcc (@6.4v irl) + 12.0V VPP
<br />
<br />what is endian-ness and how would i? is there another common term for it as I have never come across that word?
