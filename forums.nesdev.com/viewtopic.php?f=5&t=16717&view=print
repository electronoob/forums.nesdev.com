		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I've already said that I think the Genesis for the most part sounds better (I'll take the tinnier noise over the ultra muffled fare of the SNES) but there are a few games that actually manage to sound very clear and have me wondering how they could have fit all the sound data into the puny 64KB of audio ram. The Donkey Kong Country games all sound very good for the most part, but a few songs like Gangplank Galleon, Bayou Boogie, and Rockface Rumble sound nearly CD quality. It's really dependent on what instruments are being used for each song, as while I love both Nuts and Bolts and Big Boss Blues, the guitar sound samples are of noticeably less quality than the rest for whatever reason. Ironically, if you listen to Rendering Ranger R2, the guitar sounds sound almost exactly like the ones from the Roland SC55 while some of the others are shit-tier (Stage 2's music will make your ears bleed). I'm assuming the disparity in instrument quality in songs has more to do with space than how the instruments themselves sound, unless there are some instruments that aren't as impacted by lower sample rates or Gaussian filtering. Also, although it sounds like shit, the SFC port of Undercover Cops blows my mind for having so many sound samples that need to be played at the same time even if they are terrible. <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hG-DIhaK5BQ#t=10m58s">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hG-DIhaK5BQ#t=10m58s</a><!-- m -->

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I suspect that the best sounding SNES games don't just sound so good because of high-quality samples - although I'm sure that's a part of it.<br /><br />Listen to something like the flutes on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yaV-0EVdVs" class="postlink">Seiken Densetsu 3's soundtrack</a>. That's a good sample for sure, but I also bet that the sound engine gave the composer a ton of flexibility to manipulate that sample in real-time, to make it warble and decay and vary the intensity in a really natural way.<br /><br />The worst sounding SNES games are the ones that sound like they're just blaring a sequence of WAV files at me. Even if they're &quot;realistic&quot; WAV files, it sounds rinky-dink.

So it's definitely possible to go beyond what people usually expect from this machine.<br />Tim Follin is another really fine example - although I much prefer his NES soundtracks, the music in Plok sounds remarkably clear compared to almost every other SNES game.<br /><br />One thing I always suspected is that the constant attempt to make something that sounds like real instruments tended to backfire a lot on developers. No matter the sample rate, there are just some sounds that will never come out well on a SNES, especially for the purpose of playing music. Certain instruments will work better than others, and electronic/synthetic music is always easier to get the right sound out of.<br />And of course, just like when you are mixing your tracks in &quot;actual&quot; music production, I'm sure you want to prevent the frequencies of multiple instruments to clash with eachother. I woudn't be surprised if a lot of SNES musicians weren't too familiar with this concept. It's definitely another thing David Wise did really well.

David Wise is listed in the credits, but from my understanding, he didn't really do much of anything for this game. I actually really like the music in DKC3, even if most people don't. It really goes well with the atmosphere of the levels, like how the music for the water levels is earie and the music for the mill levels is lighthearted. Most people gush over Stickerbrush Symphony and Forest Interlude, but I never liked how &quot;bubbly&quot; they are considering the setting, although the haunted forest levels are a bit comical (of course, the whole game is with its concept and art style). Flight of the Zinger and Bayou Boogie are awesome though.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">Sumez wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">No matter the sample rate, there are just some sounds that will never come out well on a SNES, especially for the purpose of playing music.</div><br />That would be the sample rate. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_lol.gif" alt=":lol:" title="Laughing" /> I sincerely doubt any instruments in any of the songs I listed run at the full 32KHz.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">Sumez wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">And of course, just like when you are mixing your tracks in &quot;actual&quot; music production, I'm sure you want to prevent the frequencies of multiple instruments to clash with eachother.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Star Ocean has some nice stuff.  They had a streaming engine, where they'd switch out instruments while the track was playing.  As far as I know it's the only commercial game that did that, unless you count the intro to Tales of Phantasia.  The result is that several tracks are undumpable in SPC format.<br /><br />Lord of the Rings has a non-encapsulated audio engine and is therefore undumpable; not sure of the details.  There are a couple of really nice tracks on there.<br /><br />NBA Live '96 seems to have stuffed the ARAM so full of samples there wasn't room for an engine, though that's just a guess.  It's undumpable too.<br /><br />My amazing ports of [redacted], Street Fighter Alpha 2 and Thunder Force IV use a high-speed HDMA streaming engine, similar to the one in Espozo's port of Metal Slug.  It allows up to two 32 kHz channels or three 22 kHz channels of streamed audio, or a larger number of lower-bitrate channels, and it can be used either to play samples live or to switch out static samples, code, or song data.  All with only a few percent load on the S-CPU.  If this ever actually happens it will be cool...  Heck, if I ever got a sound playing on the SPC700 it would be cool...<br /><br />But I don't think anybody's going to beat blargg's record - one minute of <em>uncompressed</em> 32 kHz 15-bit stereo sound with just a few bytes of ARAM used...

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />As long as you have some of the more prominent instruments sounding clear (such as the guitar in Plok), I'm sure you can get away with a lot more muddled sounds for all the subtle stuf. The biggest issue of a lot of SNES soundtracks is how the &quot;foreground&quot; of the music tends to blend into the &quot;background&quot;. I really hate the Castlevania IV soundtrack for this, but people love that, so I shouldn't comment on it. YMMV I guess.
