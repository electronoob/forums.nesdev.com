<br />Jeroen, you've officially been credited <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />  You should get your copy of the cart in a few weeks I hope. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />  However, our games are all NTSC.

<br />
<br />He has very long hair, you just can't see it behind him.  It stops maybe a foot above his butt.  He looks quite different than his pictures on his band's web site.

First time I shaved it I left the (really long) goatee, but I had to take that off partly because anywhere I went I had people constantly asking me "how long did that take to grow?".  With a full beard, they just look at you funny and don't ask questions, heheh.
<br />
<br />cpow (Nesicide author) was also missing from that photo.
<br />
<br />It was really great to meet everyone who was able to attend.  Getting to play with all sorts of old consoles and computers was really fun too, not to mention all the pinball and arcade games.
<br />
<br />Building the multicarts for the show was quite an experience too.. I did the label cutting and final assembly while riding at 65-70mph through Illinois.

<br />I figure it's a little better than just having a giant neckbeard, one seems like it'd be less detrimental to job interviews than the other, even if it's for a dorky techy programming job. :S

<br />
<br />Yeah, my next board will be a good mapper that's cheap enough for games to use if they need the extra features (8 registers including IRQ and mirroring control).  Sometime after that I can design (and hopefully afford to produce) my ultimate memory mapper.

<br />I thought a neckbeard was a requirement for programming positions. I had to grow mine out a bit before I started interviewing <img src="./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" />
