I've tried 2 other SNES's and they both world fine with the adapter...<br /><br />At this point, it's a mystery I'd like to solve. I'm tempted to take apart the SFC and see if there's anything weird inside.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />How about a mechanical problem? The second cartridge is probably supposed to rest on the case of the console. If the console is shaped a bit differently, then you might get bad contacts some way.<br />The supply line on the left side of the photo looks as if it would connect to only one of the two supply pins, which would be strange, but I guess that the second pin is connected on the other of the PCB.<br />The switch allows to select which of the to cartridges to use as ROM and as CIC? Does that work both ways, ie. when you swap the cartridges, and toggle the switch, then the game works with the same glitches?<br />The PAR and Game Genie do also have two slots, and do work when using them instead of the adapter? Then the problem should be related to the adapter (not the console, and not the cartridge).

I suspect that the adaptor doesn't hide any special electronics on the rear side... which would leave the two game cartridges, is one of them containing special coprocessors?<br />That could be actually a huge problem since the sockets have only the middle pins passed on to the cartridges :-) so many coprocessor games definetly can't work with it.

That would be... ;-)<br /><br />Why do you want to cut the extra lines? I wouldn't think that they do pick-up or produce too much noise. And if you leave them intact then you could someday upgrade the thing by adding the missing sockets, if you should ever want to do that.<br /><br />21MHz is used by many coprocessor carts, REFRESH appears to be somehow used by SGB, /WRAMSEL might be used by some memory mappers though I can't grasp the purpose of pin, SOUND-L/R is also used by SGB, EXPAND is used by Satellaview, and PA0-7,/PARD,/PAWR are used mainly on expansion port, not on cartridges port (except, Nintendo's diagnostics cartridge might use them, some copiers might use them, not that there is much chance to mount a copier on the adaptor, and some S-DD1 carts have a capacitor on PA1 for whatever sinister tuning/workaround purpose).

Just look at how far the connector &quot;overlaps&quot; the regular 46 pins on the right side as compared to the left, where there's a small tab at the lower end of the black plastic (which is missing on the right side).<br /><br />In other words, that &quot;Super T Connector&quot; is utter garbage. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />

However, sin(10 degrees) = 0.17365, meaning a 46 pin connector would have to be about as deep as 4 pins.
