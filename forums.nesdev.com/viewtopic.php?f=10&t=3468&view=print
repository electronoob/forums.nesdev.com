		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />This is more a question of curiosity at this point.  There is a FF1 hack by Grond called FF++.  What makes this hack unique (among other things) is that the World of Chaos addon is also a FF1 hack and uses the same save memory as the original.  In other words, you beat FF++, and then use the same save game to start a new game in FF++WoC.
<br />
<br />Is it possible to reproduce this effect on a cart somehow?  The only things I can think of is either custom build a cart with removable memory, or try to fit both in a single rom, like a hacked ff1+2j.  The only commercial game I can think of that has ever done something like this is sonic3/s&amp;k for genesis.
<br />
<br />I don't really have time to mess with this right now as I'm working on the Hebereke hack/translation.  Just throwing it out there for now - any ideas?

Only problem is, if both games are packed to the brim, even if I double the rom size and combine them, would I still have room for a title menu?

It should be fairly easy to add the 256K switching to the code, provided there's enough space (the original FF has quite a bit of space, but the space may have been used up in making the hack).

<br />- FF1 is one of the very few commecrial games that does not initialise RAM at all
<br />- FF1 makes heavy use of CHR RAM, so there is no such things as CHR data
<br />
<br />Why not just play the hacks with PowerPak, as you can manipulate SAV files with your PC and play on the real hardware with the Powerpak ?

<br />
<br />teoma, I'm impressed that you're considering doing this. I have wondered myself if it ever would (or could) be done. I had also thought about that FF1&amp;2j cart, whether its menu could be used in some way... I'm very interested to see what you come up with.
<br />
<br />Perhaps you could even be so kind as to make me a copy <img src="./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" /> I'd be willing to pay a reasonble price, naturally. Of course, I understand that's a ways off yet.
<br />(For myself I think I'd prefer to hold off on getting my own hard copy until I've prepared 100% definite, final, complete versions of the hacks. Notably, there are still some bugfixes from the GameFAQs FF1 board that I haven't gotten around to implementing yet. Also, I'd still like to change much more of the music in WoC, as daunting a task as that would be.)
<br />
<br />At any rate, let me know if you need any help with this (not that I'd likely be much help; I know next to nothing about NESdev).

<br />As I am learning, it may be easier just to make a new menu from scratch.  Or maybe a 'New Game +' type option on loading savegames.  It would be nice if a 'first quest complete' bit was written to the saveram if you beat the game once, which would disable loading/saving in FF++ and enable it in WoC.
