Is there an easier way than buying single consoles and ripping out the chips? Because that would mean tremendous shipping costs, me being located in PAL territory.

I have no clue who has those chips, if they're new, pulls, or bad/fake chips, and what price they want to sell them for.  One of them claims 25k in stock and date code '09', which is clearly BS.  Submit a quote and find out if you want.  But I don't think there will be many options besides pulling them from systems.

<br />
<br />Anyway, I have gone for the tedious option of bidding on sufficiently many NES units on the free market. Unfortunately, most of them come with extra parts (cables, connectors, accessories, games) I am not interested in. Shipping all of these individually to Europe would incur quite the cost.
<br />
<br />So I am looking for someone in the US with basic solderings skills who would be willing to have 5-10 units shipped to them, desolder the CPUs, and ship them in a single small international package to Europe.
<br />
<br />In addition to negotiable monetary compensation for efforts and expenses, all the stuff aside from the CPUs could be kept.
<br />
<br />Please post in this thread or PM me.

<br />
<br />here you have 5 units for ~61euro from sweden: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.tradera.com/5-st-NES-8-Bit-NTSC--auktion_300806_102518065">http://www.tradera.com/5-st-NES-8-Bit-N ... _102518065</a><!-- m -->   (they are sold as defect units but it's probably just bad connectors)
<br />
<br />don't know if they want to ship outside sweden but if you are interested i can  could buy them, desolder and ship the CPU's where ever you want <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />

<br />Great! I did not know there were NTSC units in the EU. I have sent you a PM.
<br />
<br />Still looking for someone in the US to desolder the CPUs from the units I bought there, though (desoldering is easy!). I cannot believe it would be so hard to find someone. Just name a price!

I have a vacuum desolderer, and am curious about testing something with different mainboard revisions, so it would be worth it for me just to have the parts.  I have 3 kind of intermittent-working CopyNES's I need to fix up, so I already have some loose CPUs if it helps much for choosing them.
