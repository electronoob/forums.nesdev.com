It works perfectly for AOROM but i still getting the same glitches for UxROM as before. I kinda tried everything.

I noticed your last diagram only labeled it as A10/A11 leaving the fact your using CHR and not PRG up to assumption so I thought I'd check. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" /><br /><br />Since it's working flawlessly for AxROM, and glitched for UxROM there is really only ONE signal that can be causing this issue.  Since the PRG side is working you know most of your inputs to the '161 are correct.  None of the signals change on the CHR side going between UxROM and AxROM except CIRAM A10.  The ONLY change on the CHR side going from AxROM to UxROM is disconnecting CIRAM A10 from the '161 (PRG D4 latched output) and connect it to CHR A10 or A11 depending on mirroring.  That's the ONLY thing.<br /><br />I actually tested this conversion out on my boards last night because I had yet to fully verify everything for myself.  Coincidentally I got my jumpers mixed up and left CIRAM A10 floating.  The graphics were all glitched in a 'dirty' manner as you're discribing.  I corrected the issue proper connecting CIRAM A10 as discussed above and it works flawlessly.<br /><br />How are you verifing the connection with your multimeter?  For UxROM you can literally connect your meter between the CHR A10/A11 pin and CIRAM A10 pin on the cart connector.  If you have continiuty the only way you could have glitches is if you are shorting that line to some other signal which would then be interfering with it causing the glitches.

PPU A10/A11 (or PA10/PA11 for short) is the address on the cart edge coming from the PPU. CHR A10/A11 is the same as PPU A10/A11 on AOROM, UNROM, and MMC1, but it will be modified by any mapper more complex than an MMC1.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Yeah I guess the difference between your short hand convention and mine is what threw me off.<br /><br />The fact that your P's turn to C's and C's turns to P's seems prone to confusion though if the convention isn't thoroughly explained. <br /><br />As for naming conventions on the wiki I think it's best to not use any short hand.  Maybe it's just me but it seems the convention used by most people on the forum is to say CHR Axx and CHR ROM Axx and similarly PRG Axx, and PRG ROM Axx when there is a mapper in the middle.  I agree that does leave it a little ambiguous though when you don't know if there is a mapper in the middle or not.  Now that I think about it I do like how your convention has PPU, CPU, PRG, CHR all different it doesn't leave much to question.  The problem really only arises for short hand.  Places like the wiki we're probably best to just do without them all together.  <br /><br />Sometimes shorthand is pretty much required though, namely for things like silkscreen on PCBs.  For my boards I use C strictly for CHR and P strictly for PRG.  So I literally write P11 for PRG A11.  When I need to denote something as strictly coming from the NES I write 'N' and assume you'll know it's PPU/CPU based on the nearby label for C11.  So for a jumper that ties PPU A10 to CHR ROM A10 I'll write C10/N <br /><br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent"><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; C11/N&nbsp; (silk screen label)<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; O O&nbsp; &nbsp;(solder jumper)<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; | |<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;/&nbsp; &nbsp;\&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;(PCB traces)<br />CHR ROM A11&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; PPU A11&nbsp; &nbsp; (connections)<br /><br /></div><br /><br />The other time I use a lot of shorthand is code, but honestly my naming convention there (which I won't even bother to share) has even confused myself.  I might migrate to PPU_A[10], CHR_A[10], CPU_A[10], PRG_A[10], PRG_D[7] and such which aligns more with your method Tepples.  Fairly short to type but still lacks ambiguity.

I don't see any use of PA11/10 there.<br /><br />In any event if you're unable to tell what the acronym stands for based on the context I don't think it's useful nor helpful to use them.  I'm not sure if acronyms are the source of where Asphyx got mixed up connecting PRG A10/11 to CIRAM A10 or not.  But whatever we use on something like the wiki should avoid any ambitiousness if possible.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I figured it out in the end. Thank everyone for help! I used the PRG A10 and 11 for the mirroring indeed. I checked with some schematics later and found out that that was wrong. Can't believe i haven't noticed at the time because i already knew that the CHR lines are the ones used for mirroring. Dumb me! But anyway this was the least problem, because again my Castlevania was a NTSC version (my machine is a PAL one  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_redface.gif" alt=":oops:" title="Embarassed" />) and my connections were defective despite the fact that i double checked them multiple times and they were clean and correct. I used some common internet/network wire. Maybe the (old scavenged) dip switches were causing problems, not to mention that i used ic sockets for them. Anyway i gave up any of these and i attached the hc32 directly to my AOROM cart, using some other (and thinner) wire. I tested it using Castlevania and 1943 and they both work perfectly. So the conversion is possible. Thanks to everyone! :* Cheers!
