		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Some emulators kinda hard-code which mappers can have CHR-RAM or not, though I have no idea why. It's specified in the header, and CHR-RAM and CHR-ROM should be interchangeable, functionally. Boards with more than 8k of CHR-RAM are a problem, of course (without iNES 2 headers) so for those rare cases some sort of hard override was necessary, but otherwise &quot;bankable&quot; and &quot;writeable&quot; <em>should</em> be independent factors, I think?

Given that all PCBs had to re-route things to connect PPU /WR to get CHR RAM to work anyway, I can only assume either laziness (it is easier to rip up just one trace and route one new trace) or never bothering to reevaluate it.<br /><br />And certainly a very few games do make use of it.<br /><br /><span style="font-size: 50%; line-height: normal">(edit: I confused myself, nevermind)</span>

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />The fact that bankable CHR-RAM is so rare is certainly the reason why writeable and bankable become correlated, at least in my case. Romancia and Lagrange Point were just these strange anomalies that I didn't quite know how to handle.<br />Writing the TQROM mapper forced me to do a total refactor of how CHR was handled, so this revelation that RAM should be able to be banked always was thankfully as easy as switching a boolean. <br />And now I know better.

This is pretty exciting for me, as Lagrange Point is one of my favorite NES RPGs, and one of the most advanced games on the system. <br />Also in the sound department it adds some basic low and high pass filtering to the samples.<br /><br />There was also a pretty major performance increase. I was generating a lot of Java garbage collection due to the way I was passing audio and video to my processing threads. I'm happy to report it is no longer an issue.<br /><br />Besides those enhancements, this version comes with a lot of minor improvements including fixing a key mapping bug, some minor timing fixes, and better handling of audio and video thread cleanup.

It also allows command line rom launching (just pass the path to a rom as an argument).<br /><br />There was another round of optimizations, and rendering in particular is significantly faster. <br /><br />NMI triggering was rewritten, which fixes Bases Loaded II, and allowed me to remove a hack I had added to prevent Battletoads crashes.
