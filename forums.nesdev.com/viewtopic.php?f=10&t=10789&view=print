		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I'm totally new here, but this is the best place I could think of to get help with my issue  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_confused.gif" alt=":?" title="Confused" /> <br />Figured Newbie would be the best place to ask before hardware, but if this needs to be moved, feel free to criticize <img src="./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" /><br /><br />I'll start with saying that any help is very highly appreciated, even just reading through this text block is.<br /><br />Still, onto the issue!<br />I picked up a(pretty used) NES for $15 at a garage sale, cleaned it up well. Motherboard looks nice, only some slight rust spots on one pin for Controller 1, but was easy to gently clean with no damage to solder shield. Also not next to CPU/PPU/CIC *shrug*<br />-Also, NES-CPU-07 board, if that's of any importance<br /><br />Got it back together, worked just fine. After using SMB/Duck Hunt like usual, I tried to test the TMNT 3 cart I picked up as well..and suddenly..problem. There's a good portion of the bottom of the screen that's glitched out during the opening, which is glitchy as heck in itself! Start menu glitchy, broken text, in-game flickers and glitches out, lower score/HP display nonexistent or flickerglitchy.<br /><br />So, in troubleshooting, I tested my own copy of the same game on the aformentioned console, and it exhibited the exact same symptoms. That left me all the more confused..so I opened the cart to see if it had a special chip, only to find an MMC3 inside. I only know a little about all of that, but I was trying to find anything to work off of. Other games worked just fine, so, in a rush, I grabbed what MMC3 games that I own and could find and tried them out on the trouble console. Those games are:<br />-Low G Man (Very glitchy, lots of flicker)<br />-Kirby's Adventure (Close to totally unplayable, Lower score/text box invisible/nonexistent)<br />-SMB 3 (Once again, lower score/info box invisible/nonexistent, glitchyish)<br />-Tetris 2 (No issues that I could see)<br /><br />Tested all carts on an toaster I know works, and none exhibited any symptoms of the new NES!<br />Also tried known working 72-pins on the trouble board and same problems did not go away.<br />I'm just left here with a lead and could not find anything on the net or here about it, unsure why the NES is not playing nice with MMC3 games and not knowing what to do  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_cry.gif" alt=":cry:" title="Crying or Very sad" /> <br /><br />I only have starter soldering skills and the such, but I'd love to get this one working perfectly!<br /><br />I'll take pictures in a bit if anyone wants to see examples.

Pins #1-36 are on the other side of the PCB.<br /><br />pin #1 is under where you've labeled #36 and pin #36 is under where you've labeled #1...<br /><br />Just because you've got continuity on the main board doesn't mean you have continuity all the way to the MMC3.  If you get good contact there, then check through the 72pin connector.  Straight from the CPU to the cartridge.

I'm new to this, can say with all honesty that I'm going to be stumbling a bit &gt;_&gt;<br />I was confused because I thought it meant top-side in relation to when it's placed in orientation in the console. And the link posted said the &quot;not top&quot; side was the one with the sticker, which I thought was the NTSC one. Still..I'll check between cart and CPU next if I can manage. Would that entail just placing the raw board in to test, since I have no idea how to get test leads into a closed cart.<br /><br />Aaaand, reading back, that talk about the label was referring to cartridge, not edge connector &gt;.&lt;
