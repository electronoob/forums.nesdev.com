In FCEUX this goes in the &quot;sav&quot; folder by default, and is an 8 KB file that should be usable with most other emulators if you just put it in the correct place and/or rename it.

Only need savestates (*.st0-.st9) completely written game with the RUN command at the end. And, seems to be, games made for STTONES, written using the real keyboard on VirtuaNES. That's why without the original keyboard, the program doesn't want to work correctly on this emulator.

I've done a lot of work to optimize this program for VirtuaNES, and I really want to write and save data on it. Just tell me is it possible to optimize the special characters like &quot;:&quot;, &quot;;&quot; and &quot;*&quot; to display them in VirtuaNES and ran it without crashing? I would also like to know why after replacing the graphics in FB, on the emulator FCE Ultra program shows an error for 2-3 seconds and then goes crazy and constantly triggered a RETURN command.

It's a macro where the emulator types everything in your clipboard in the game, it takes a while if it's a big program. Copying text in Family BASIC isn't possible, best you can do is screenshot it.
