Developing this was great fun.<br />It's a port of a PC game called &quot;Mega Mountain&quot; by @sylviefluff.<br />Music was done by Damian Yerrick/DJ Tepples/PinoBatch and you can listen to it here: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lkhII2EaOzo&amp;list=PLHfgu2YLEFpvEfVPHmHeiq92NdsPwKKMb" class="postlink">Listen to the soundtrack</a><br />You can get the game from the attachment here, or, if you want to donate to me or have the game in your itch.io collection, from Itch.io: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://adrianmakesgames.itch.io/mega-mountain-nes">https://adrianmakesgames.itch.io/mega-mountain-nes</a><!-- m --><br /><br />Copied itch.io description of this follows.<br /><br /><strong>original mega mountain description, courtesy of @sylviefluff:</strong><br />Your best friend has been kidnapped and taken to the top of the Mega Mountain. You must save him.<br /><br /><strong>features:</strong><br />- a new NES game!<br />- easy and hard modes!<br />- 2 endings to discover!<br />- a platformer without jumping!<br />- not a port of cat planet!<br />- play using any available nes emulator (except nesticle) or on a real cart!

It'd help informing the players what they can and cannot do. <br /><br />-If i'd change a second thing, it'd be to give the vines a bit of a &quot;drop shadow&quot; to distinguish them from the background: green on red can be hard on the eye, and some might not be able to tell the difference (colour blindness).

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Nice little game.<br /><br />I sorta wish there was some middle ground between Easy, which had no resistance at all for me, and Hard, which I didn't find fun without savestates because the timing windows were just too narrow. The timing on the original version of the game seems much more forgiving to me (faster player, slower stars, basically).<br /><br />The climbing mechanic is interesting. I feel like a pretty good puzzle game could be made out of this. (I'm reminded a little of a puzzle game called <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifBi2e0McO8" class="postlink">Popils</a> which has no jumping, but in an almost inverse form of this mechanic you destroy blocks to make the level fall down to meet you.)<br /><br />I was surprised that the double-climb when you use a wall while touching a vine was in the original too. It felt like an accident, but it's also kind of fun. Wish there were places it could be exploited to my advantage though.<br /><br />I wasn't expecting the introduction cutscene! I missed it the first time I tried playing, only caught it when I reset to go back and play through easy mode and happened to wait a few moments there. That's new, right? I can't seem to make it happen in the original game.<br /><br />What's Cat Planet? (Are you remaking it for NES now...?)

I'd be tempted to improve in presentation over the original, such as by having different animation states (like how are the walls and vines ascended? Levitation, Climbing, and if so, in which manner, etc.)

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Nice little game, would recommend for Action 53.<br /><br />A thing that would be nice to improve is making sure to that after a screen load that the screen turns on only at vblanks, that way you don't see single frames glitches of rainbow stripes, misaligned screens, and stale sprite placement. (also continuing to play the music in screen transitions)<br /><br />I also found a interesting corner case of hitting the next screen edge, and the death screen edge at the same time. I would expect it to kill you to restart at the same screen, but instead it plays the death sound and proceeds to the next screen.<br /><br />Edit: Remove video link, as youtube flagged it as &quot;spam&quot;. replaced with a elaboration on what was going on in video.
