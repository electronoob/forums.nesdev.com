Can anyone assure me that the background actually scrolls the correct way if say your right eye or left eye is covered?</div><br /><br />If the right eye is darkened, object moving to the right will be &quot;foreground&quot;, and motion to the left will be &quot;background&quot;. (Darken the left eye for Jim Power.)<br /><br />If you've got polarized sunglasses, and you're looking at a polarized LCD screen (most computer monitors are), you can probably play with how darkened it looks by rotating the sunglasses, which will help you find a tradeoff between darkness causing the &quot;delay&quot; effect and darkness removing the contribution of that eye to the picture. There seems to a balance where it works best.<br /><br />The effect is weaker the slower the motion is, and disappears when there's no motion. Since Jim Power lets you backtrack, the effect is backwards if you go back to the left, and of course drops out if you ever stop. This really hurts the effect, I think, since you really need sustained motion to make work (and even then it's a fairly weak effect).<br /><br />From what I've seen, black and white or other plain colouring also seems to be more successful at the effect than colourful and busy artwork like Jim Power's.

The effect is interesting to say the least.
