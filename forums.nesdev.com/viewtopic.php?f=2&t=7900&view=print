		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />This thought came to my mind.  Did any developers program NES games using other 6502-based computers with more powerful graphics chips, counted animation frame, take out frames or tiles that wouldn't fit in the NES's CHRROM, then take the ASM code for the game logic and write the PPU code after they made sure everything would work?
<br />
<br />I've never programmed the NES, but for the SNES, animation was my #1 problem, and it would've made sense doing it this way.

I.e., your game engine can run even without any of the graphics subroutines. Given this, I can imagine someone doing what you said. More than likely though, I'm thinking they just used special copynes-like dev NESes and just tweaked their code on that.

<br />The problem comes when you have to deliver your game logic across platforms with 6502, two different 8080 derivatives (one by Sharp and one by Zilog), 65816, and 68000. That's why Koei just bit the bullet and wrote its games in C, according to NovaYoshi's educated guess. A similar problem occurs when trying to make modern games that work on Windows Phone 7 and Xbox 360 (verifiable CIL only), BlackBerry (verifiable JVM bytecode only), and everything else (native code preferred).

<br />Not sure if you understood my question.  I'm talking about using a different computer for placeholder graphics so you knew how many frames of animation your working with, before you program the PPU handling code.

<br />I think you are putting way too much emphasis on animation frames. I know it has been a problem for you, but I don't think this was a major concern for most developers, specially on the NES where the animation graphics are either all loaded in at all times or simply bankswitched in as necessary. Few NES games dynamically update animations in CHR-RAM, which is what actually complicates things (I'm doing this in my game, and I agree it's a bit hard to get right). But even then it's not such a big deal.

<br />
<br />Well I haven't programmed in a while because I lost interest in it.  I guess part of the reason why I put so much effort on animation frames, was because I felt I needed to prove Sega Genesis fanboys that the SNES can run fast action games dispite what has been said about it's CPU speed, and animation is an important part of what makes an action game look fast.

They probably did deelop/debug some code using other 6502 machines, but I don't think this had anything to do with animations.

<br />Then I'm 100% on your side : Screw you Sega Genesis fanboys !!
<br />
<br />More seriously, first I don't know many computers which are more powerful than the NES and uses 6502. I'm pretty sure Apple II and C64 are less "powerful" than the NES. Also they have completely different screen resolutions and modes, and porting the graphics from one platform to the other would end up a total nightmare. In fact it might end up less hard to port code from one processor to another than port graphics with totally different screen modes.
<br />
<br />I guess the PC engine uses a 6502 and is more powerful than the NES. Although I know basically nothing about this machine. Also the SNES uses a 65816 which can be retro-compatible with 6502.
<br />
<br />Even if you'd use a PCE or SNES to prototype a NES game, what would you gain from it ? You could do better graphics and more calculations per frame. But it wouldn't change the difficulty to code the game, and in the end you'd have to "downscale" it to the NES which sounds hard.
<br />So I guess you'd add yourself a lot of useless work.

Not to mention the sheer amount of different sized registers, pointers, multiple stacks [In the 6809 at least], etc. Plus with the Genesis, you have a Z80 just for sound. And the 68K is way more ready for arithmetic than the 65816. It's be awesome if you could make a SNES game that is as good, but I don't think you'll be able to do as much at all. But you can probably make a better game, as except for the CPU, the SNES kills is in graphics, and IMO even sounds, quite often. So the power is useless when it doesn't look and sound great.

<br />
<br />I think that'd be cool to do, but yeah the downgrades and changes to take advantage of better hardware might not be worth it. Yeah, the main engine mainly stays the same, but the subroutines and music engine and graphics engine all would probably need rewritten. That sounds like a nightmare to me, especially if you take advantage of the hardwares layout, because then you may also have to change up your main engine, and you'd be writing the game essentially from scratch again. I think it's a neat idea, but I won't be doing it any time soon, good luck!

<br />
<br /> Exactly. A game developed for the NES/Famicom should be developed from the ground up with the target system's limitations in mind (so you can specifically code around them and/or hide them). The PCE cpu is quite a few revisions away from the 6502 used in the NES (instructions, registers, etc), but it's the actual speed that's fairly big difference (1.79mhz NES vs 7.16mhz PCE).
<br />
<br /> Did someone mention sticking a 68k into the NES? It's wouldn't solve much. The surrounding/supporting video hardware is still a <em>fairly</em> big performance influencing factor. A 1.79mhz 68k isn't going to be as fast as you think compared to a 1.79mhz 6502, for the NES. The 68k is powerful, but <em>slow</em>. The 65x is extremely fast but <em>simplistic </em>(direct addressing with free indexing and the ZP registers for indirect addressing are the real meat of the performance).

<br />I mean more powerful in terms of flexibility, not more powerful in terms of graphics.
<br />
<br />SNES PPU is powerful in terms of graphics, but weak in terms of flexibility.
<br />
<br />Maybe we should move this to SNESdev or general discussion, because I was refering to ALL classic systems, I was just using the NES as an example.  This isn't exclusive to NES.

<br />May I ask what exactly you are thinking when you mention "flexibility" ? I don't see much gain from having a more powerful platform with the same CPU.... It might have better graphics audio that you won't be able to use, and the CPU might be faster. That's all that is going to change... I don't see the point.

<br />Also, I think more to your original point, I've heard that some developers implemented and tested large portions of their games on Apple II GS's back in the day, then layered graphics and audio on top of it once they got over to the NES. I can't recall where I heard that, might have been the Pony Canon episode of Retronaughts.
