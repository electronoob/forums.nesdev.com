How many games were submitted that you were involved with making?  Your graphics might have upped the standard on how these competition games should look!

Still pretty satisfied i worked on them too. I've learned a _lot_.<br /><br />I can't wait playing all these through now that i'll have some free time in February. It's a lot more fun than any commercial releases out there, imo

I'm usually able to shift around assignments and contracts as long as they get finished on time, or otherwise pick dates for gigs as i need when touring fairs and expos. <br />-The amount of work is a little uneven so sometimes there's no spare time at all, at other times i can really dedicate myself for hours on end. It helps at least me that there are some unfragmented pockets of time where i can focus on doing one thing. <br />-When touring i almost always take the bus or train, which means i can work on hobby stuff while traveling.<br />-1 monthevery year spent in an isolated cabin with not much else to do, working in a park daytime, moving pixels and music on the evening. My version of paid vacation. <br />-Rest of the year i live in a co-housing with a couple of people of similar life philosophy and occupations. Pushes down rent and monthly fees almost by half, which means i can sometimes afford a bit of unpaid leave to pursue other things in life, including this. <br />-the house is too small to raise a family, so none of us do that for the time being. Might be the biggest factor, haha.

I have only released a few small projects done in C so far, but I wanted to do it from scratch with my own engine in 6502 for everything this time. It is coming along nicely, I finally got my 4 way scrolling working yesterday. I've thrown it out and started over about 4 times, but now I am pretty happy with it. Next up is the level format and compression. If all else fails I will just throw massive amounts of ROM at the problem <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /> Maybe I will submit something for the 2018 compo!<br /><br />Your NES art is very good, FrankenGraphics. I am impressed!

If spare time for doing homebrew is limited, getting a bit &quot;excessive&quot; with ROM space is a pretty good trade against spending all of that time making the leanest framework possible.. and then still have a game to make.  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_surprised.gif" alt=":o" title="Surprised" /> Unless you consider it an important sport to make it fit into a historical board configuration with less space, i suppose. <br /><br />Well then, looking forward to see you join in next year then?  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=":wink:" title="Wink" /> <br /><br />...Also thanks! Much appreciated.
