Was this an oversight, or on purpose because there are supposed to have been bus-conflict-avoiding UxROM and CNROM boards (though I don't know any) but no bus-conflict-avoiding MHROM/GNROM board?<br /><br />Edit: Mapper 16 proposal modified to not collide with previous deprecated proposal.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Yes, discrete logic mappers were only allocated variations as we found they existed. <br /><br />Submappers were allocated for VRC2/4 because the conflation actually exposed bugs in the lumped emulation (such as Wai Wai World relying on <em>not</em> have 1-screen mirroring, or ... whatever the game is that incorrectly starts writing to the wrong register set during the credits).<br /><br />But as far as we know, there's no emulation failures due to lumping the two PCB layouts for VRC7.<br /><br />On the other hand, the difference in IRQ behavior on the Bandai FCG series definitely does warrant something. Unfortunately, <a href="https://wiki.nesdev.com/w/index.php/NES_2.0_submappers/Proposals#016:_Bandai_FCG_boards" class="postlink">kevtris already allocated some redundancy here</a> and has separately made it clear that <a href="https://forums.nesdev.com/viewtopic.php?p=152623#p152623" class="postlink">he's not interested in being told his allocations were redundant</a>.

The wiki previously mentioned Colorful Dragon as CNROM without bus conflicts, but that one turned out to be a mapper hack, as confirmed by redumps of the original Sachen cartridge and of a Game Doctor FDS disk that matched the Mapper 3 ROM in its PRG/overdumped CHR data. Camerica games are basically UNROM without bus conflicts, but those go as Mapper 71 anyway.<div class="quotetitle">lidnariq wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">But as far as we know, there's no emulation failures due to lumping the two PCB layouts for VRC7.</div>I'd still like to allocate it for consistency as well as neatness and exactness of emulation.<div class="quotetitle">lidnariq wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">Unfortunately, kevtris already allocated some redundancy here and has separately made it clear that he's not interested in being told his allocations were redundant.</div>Do we need to take that older proposal into account? Has any emulator implemented it? I suppose I could change the new submapper numbers to ones not used by that older proposal.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />The only games we have confirmed that have issues with bus conflict are Cybernoid and Donkey Kong Official Edition.  The former requires bitwise AND of CPU value and ROM value to function properly after changing from music to sound effects or vice versa, the latter requires the absence of bus conflicts to work without graphics glitches.  Both ROMs can be patched to avoid these issues.  Officially both games use Mapper 3/CNROM, which canonically does not have bus conflict prevention hardware.  Other games either account for bus conflicts or use hardware which accounts for them.
