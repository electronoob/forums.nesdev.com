If you go for cycle accuracy then you need more work as you have to separate all instruction into cycles (instead of executing them as a bulk and advcing the clock of N cycles). Emulating accurately a pipelined CPU should be harder as you have to simulate the hazards, stalls, etc...<br /><br />Emulating audio should be rather easy since you can just reuse parts of an exiting player plugin.<br /><br />The hard part should be doing the graphics. You need to emulate the console's GPU well enough to support most games. I bet the only way is to generate the image pixel by pixel, and then send it to the screen somehow. I never coded anything that's using a GUI so I have no idea how hard this is to do, but it sounds the hardest part.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Dealing with the OS is always a chore, because the way you do something is mostly arbitrary. Similarly, if the emulated system isn't well-documented, there's lots of trial-and-error, and you're left with emulating the games rather than the system. Another hurdle is getting a clear view of what's going on in your emulator and the emulated system when things aren't working right. It's also good to have a clear idea at the beginning of the scope of your effort, e.g. how accurate, how efficient, what's good enough, what doesn't matter. If you change these as you develop, you might have to redo lots of the program.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I think it depends on the level of knowledge of the emulator author, and the types of emulated systems beforehand. <br /><br />As a newbie who started emulating about 7 months ago, and who literally did not know what a register or an instruction was about 8 months ago, I had an incredibly hard time getting started writing the NES emulator. I didn't understand why I was doing anything until a few months in, and even now, I only have a mostly-working CPU, and a semi-working PPU.<br /><br />Anyway, emulating the instruction set of a CPU should never be really hard. It's simply following a list and interpreting each instruction in a higher-level language, which is approximately the same for every CPU, but individual instructions are just more/less complex. I think the problem lies in little quirks that you can easily misunderstand or accidentally get wrong, like flags, modes (in case of ARM/8086 etc), individual cycles, external interrupts, and so forth. Looking at the ARM instruction set doesn't exactly make me shudder; it's all the things around it -- which are needed to make it a functional processor -- that scare me.<br /><br />I think the graphics processor's complexity depends on the system. The NES's PPU was quite hard for me to understand, and probably as much so for others who had no experience with it, but according to an x86 emulator author (miker00lz) in this thread: <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/viewtopic.php?f=3&amp;t=10495&amp;start=15" class="postlink">http://forums.nesdev.com/viewtopic.php?f=3&amp;t=10495&amp;start=15</a>, emulating the x86 CPU was hard, but emulating a low-res VGA card (which can run the likes of Ultima and Doom mind you) was relatively simple compared to the NES's PPU. I guess it depends on what the system was made for. An early system built to run a multi-purpose home OS is apparently bound to have a complex processor but a pretty simple GPU.<br /><br />I can't tell you anything about sound, although I will say that I'm not planning to use any kind of library for my NES APU emulation. I'm writing the emu from scratch, so I guess I'll have a hard time getting that to work as well.<br /><br />All in all, it just depends on the system I suppose. CPU differs, GPU differs, but in general, if you have the knowledge, documentation (like Blargg said, very important if you don't want to spend half the time doing trial-and-error) and motivation, it's never far-fetched. Some assembly skill of the particular system helps IMMENSELY, at least it did help me. Of course you should keep in mind that even an emulator of something as relatively simple as an NES takes months/years to develop into something worthy of using, so it's never easy to write an emulator, it just gets easier with experience/knowledge.<br /><br />Sorry if it sounds like crap coming from a barely-experienced newbie <img src="./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" /> this is all just from my point of view though.<br /><br />PS: You have like 5.5+k posts :O I thought you'd have written a dozen emulators by now. Maybe you have and this is just one of those curiosity questions? Who knows <img src="./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" />

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />To me, audio emulation is the hardest part. The CPU is pure logic, easy to trace and watch. The PPU is visual: I can tweak values and <em>see</em> when they're correct. Audio is just a huge crapshoot, and all the jargon around it boggles my mind.<br /><br />The PPU has pixels, tiles, sprites and attributes. I can visualize it all. The APU has periods, attack-decay-sustain-release, decimation, high-pass filters, low-pass filters, Nyquist limits, bass, treble, mids, equalizers, echo, frequency, decibels, windowed sinc, polyphase, band-limited synthesis, FIR filters, IIR filters, interpolation (gaussian, cubic spline, etc), DC bias, clipping, gain, impedance, reverb, on and on forever and ever. It's never explained step-by-step, instead you are given sigma notation expressions and expected to know enough calculus to make sense of it. Any time you do read up on it, every last person and article explains each thing completely differently.<br /><br />As far as overall, it highly depends upon the documentation. Great hardware documentation is like having the answer key to an exam. Without being given the answers, very minor details have taken me several weeks of research to figure out and exhaust all other possibilities (it's not just knowing one of many ways to simulate a behavior, but ruling out every possibility except for the correct one.)<br /><br />Experience plays a big role as well. My first emulator took a few months to run commercial games. My NES emulator took about 12 hours to fully run Super Mario Bros with no glitches. And again, documentation helped a lot there.<br /><br />At the end of the day, it's nothing special to be able to write emulators. A moderate IQ capable of programming, and a good bit of perseverance to keep at something until it works. The actual math and research steps are very basic, which is how someone of average intelligence like myself can get by. Of course, you can ramp up the difficulty all you like by targeting newer and newer systems.

This, in my experience, is rarely the case -- I find certain things that are older to be significantly more complex due to the fact that today's technology is made to be easier (many things are linear) while older technology tends to be less so due to financial/technological constraints at the time.  Things designed then were designed with very specific limitations kept in mind; things today are often designed with very different mindsets given how technology (hardware and software both) have improved and progressed over the years.  I will however say that the introduction of 3D into the marketplace has made a complete clusterfuck of KISS principle, but like the rest of this post, that's my opinion.<br /><br /><a href="http://webpages.charter.net/danrollins/techhelp/0089.HTM" class="postlink">CGA graphics are a &quot;packed pixel&quot;</a>, and the scanlines are non-linear (even lines start at a different base memory address than odd lines).  CGA also has all sorts of customisations you can set (bitmap vs. text mode) that make the thing a configurable, non-linear mess.  That doesn't even begin to touch on compatibility issues between CGA adapters.  CGA came out in 1980 or thereabouts.<br /><br />Compare that to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mode_13h" class="postlink">classic VGA 320x200 256-colour mode</a>, which out-of-the box (no &quot;register tweaks&quot; or things like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mode_X" class="postlink">&quot;Mode X&quot;</a> or the true/real way VGA works) where some of the memory layouts are packed or planar) is completely linear, a.k.a. &quot;mode 0x13&quot;: one byte per pixel in segment 0xA000, where each byte represents an entry in a palette that you can define the R/G/B values of yourself through some memory-mapped I/O registers.  VGA came out in 1986 or thereabouts.<br /><br />My advice to anyone considering an emulator: just stop.  If you really want to write one or tinker with one, particularly for the NES, <a href="http://wiki.nesdev.com/w/index.php/Emulators#Under_development" class="postlink">look at this page</a> and then tell me inventing another one is worth the time and effort.  (Hint: it isn't.  Instead, what would be worthwhile would be getting rid of all the wonky bugs in existing emulators and making their UIs more user-friendly/sane.  It's remarkable how many shit the bed in various ways when you do something like click a menu while the emulator is running, etc.).

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Thanks for the answer, a lot of different points of views.<br />To make things clear (esp. for Koitsu) I am not considering at all of writing a NES emulator, asking this might have implied that I was considering it but no, this was just to know how hard it is, no more, no less. I was maybe considering to be writing a CPU emulator for something completely different that has no relationship to the NES, so please don't think I'm stupid for asking this. Also it'd be nice if you would stop to complain that every single thing in the world sucks so hard and use swearing all the time, it'd be nice.<br /><br />@byuu, I perfectly get your point exactly. If some sample in sound emulation is wrong, it's unnoticeable just by ear, but if a pixel is wrong, you'll definitely notice it. If an instruction is wrong, any program using it will crash or behave incorrectly so it'll be easy to spot (assuming the program itself isn't packed with bugs <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /> )<br /><br />@blargg, yes I perfectly get your point too, if you write an innacurate emulator, and then say &quot;oh s***t I want it to be accurate&quot; then you can't just improve it but have to re-think entirely how it is made internally.<br /><br />@ArsonIzer : Your viewpoint is very ineresting. You wanted to do an emulator without knowing anything about a CPU, that's a great achievement I'd have to say. And no a high post count doesn't mean I wrote multiple emulators, I never got interest for this. Like tepples I come here to develop games and tools (but the later only because there is a lack of tools on the market, so if I don't have a specific tool that does something I want to do I have to write it myself).<br />I only wrote 2 tools (3 in total but one of them isn't related to game development) and 0 games so far. Yes, 10 years of having this as a hobby, and 0 games. Yeah I suck. I have several half complete games though.<br /><br />@wendesday :<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">'The only thing hard about emulation is the documentation.'</div><br /><br />So this means if you emulate a perfectly documented system, it'll be extremely easy to emulate it ??<br /><br />Also, although all those answers are interesting, none of them really answers what I wanted to know. I'm sorry for being so annoying. I was more asking myself how is components like RAM, ROM and graphics are emulated.<br />Are they just huge char arrays in your code ? Or is there something I'm missing ?<br />How do you simulate a processor read that goes decoded to different peripherals ?<br />Is the screen emulated pixel by pixel or do you use openGL or some kind of hardware acceleration ?<br />How is the synchronisation between the various parts (CPU, GPU, APU) done ?<br />That's more of the stuff I was interested in knowing.<br /><br />Again I am not talking about the NES, but about systems in general (including systems which have nothing in common with a gaming console). Sorry for not being clear about it.

But I think part of the problem is that more obscure systems weren't as popular so nowhere near as many people flock to them to &quot;create an emulator of it so I can learn computer science&quot;.  Most of the new guys around here start out with &quot;I know not a lick of assembly language nor how to program in C or make a UI, but I thought it'd be cool to learn how to make a NES emulator...&quot;.  In the educational sense, it *is* worth the time and effort because there's a shitton of principles that can be learned from the exercise.  In practice, though, putting your creation on a page of &quot;NES emulators&quot; might be kind of like creating the &quot;flashlight app&quot; [an act which takes no specialized code beyond the instantiation of a new single view project in Xcode], and releasing &quot;your creation&quot; onto the App Store.<br /><br />The next part of the problem is there's too many goddamn UI toolkits.  Everyone has their favorite and wants to do something &quot;great/cool/spectacular&quot; in it to learn it.  But there again...learning a UI toolkit while writing a NES emulator means you'll have menus that malfunction and expected UI user experience that goes to /dev/null.  I'm as guilty of that as anyone else [started with MFC which I was 'fairly experienced in' -- moved to Qt and I'm *still* learning Qt].  But in the &quot;open source&quot; mindset, if you're trying to generate interest it's far better to get something out that has promise/potential that others can see how they might be able to improve/help, than it is to spit and polish alone.  Open source software hasn't quite hit the &quot;99 cent app wall&quot; that plagues app development...people don't necessarily expect perfection...and are largely patient with the authors ability to keep up with bug reports, etc.  I've taken a look at other emulators written in other UI toolkits and almost barfed...I'm sure people do the same about my emulator/IDE since Qt is just one way of skinning the UI cat.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />@Bregalad<br /><br />If you did have a perfectly documented computer in your native language which answered all of your questions without the need for looking elsewhere then the only <em>bottleneck</em> would be something to do with the individual writing the emulator.<br /><br />Lack of confidence, lack of time, poor programming skills, starting a PSX emulator before we can write a NES one etc. are the only kind of problems that I faced when writing my emulator when I started WedNESday since 2003. Back then? I didn't have <em>A F*****G CLUE </em> what the hell I was doing. But 10 years on, all of those problems I just mentioned don't get in my way anymore.<br /><br />Confident? Hell yes. Time? I'm unemployed. Programming skills? Great. So much better than back then but always room for improvement of course. Starting a PSX emulator before you can even write a NES one? Well, I've done my NES one now, almost, and I know now that I can accomplish anything emulator-wise just as long as I am willing to dedicate myself to it AND there is of course, sufficient documentation.
