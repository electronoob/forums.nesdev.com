		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Hello all!
<br />
<br />I'm working on a simple one-screen platforming game, which is actually coming along quite nicely. I have one small thing that annoys me though, if I turn on PAL emulation there is garbled graphics at the top of the screen (and bottom, but I know where that is coming from). 
<br />
<br />I'm guessing this has to do with the fact that I have set the Y scroll to 248 to make the top 8 pixels visable, that are hidden by the NTSC overscan if Y scroll is set to zero. However I'm living in PAL country so I really want it to look nice in PAL aswell.
<br />
<br />Here is how it looks:
<br /><img src="http://driar.se/pic/nes/the_game_error.png" alt="Image" />
<br />
<br />I'm not really sure where the error graphics at the top is coming from, and hence my question. I was thinking of clearing the entire VRAM in my init section (right now it just clears Work RAM), I figured that might make the problem go away, but I'm still curious where the error at the top is coming from? If I look in FCEUX's NameTable viewer the error is not visible. The game currently doesn't use any mapper and is set to vertical mirroring if that makes any difference?
<br />
<br />I tried blanking out most of VRAM in the RAM editor in FCEUX with no luck... soo, to sum it all up, where is the PPU picking up the garbled graphics at the top?

<br />
<br />You're rendering the attribute tables...there's only 240 scanlines NTSC or PAL.

<br />
<br />Thanks a lot!

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />If you set the vertical scroll to values between 240 and 255 you force the NES to render attribute table data as if it was name table data. If you do like tepples said instead and set the scroll to 232, the PPU will render 8 scanlines and automatically wrap from 239 to 0. That's normal PPU behavior.
<br />
<br />As long as you write that diagonal pattern to the last 2 rows of the name table and use vertical mirroring, a scroll value of 232 should result in the effect you're going for.

<br />But the PAL screen is not 256 pixels high... Both PAL and NTSC consoles always have the same resolution, 256x240.
<br />
<br />What happens is that some emulators are configured to hide the top and bottom 8 scanlines in NTSC mode (so only 224 are visible), which is not useful at all if you are a developer.
<br />
<br />You should change the video setting so that all scanlines are visible in both modes.

<br />
<br />Yeah, I will make sure that I always show the entire 240 pixels from now on. Thanks for all the information, everything is a lot more clear now.
<br />
<br />Now - onwards to implementing a mapper and bankswitching!

<br /><img src="http://i.imgur.com/zJ18X.png" alt="Image" />
<br />
<br />Dark blue area is clipped on my old TV.
<br />Notice that a lot of games try to avoid putting functional elements into the top and bottom 16 pixels.  You can see it clearly in Super Mario Bros, Castlevania, etc.
<br />
<br />So oddly enough, the "broken" screenshot would be better when clipped on an old TV than one where the top scroll is set to 0.  Setting it to Y=232 avoids drawing the attribute tables.  (If you are using horizontal mirroring, you can set it to Y=232 on the second nametable, and then it will wrap back to the main screen 8 pixels later.)
<br />
<br />Now if this game is only intended to run on emulators, then you have a lot more leeway here, and don't need to constrain the game to run on old clip-happy TVs.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I'm definitely going to make sure that the game (if ever finished) works on original hardware, so yeah, I'll have to take the overscan into consideration. Now when the bug is fixed it still looks like on the broken picture, except for the 8 pixels on the top and bottom are just black tiles instead of garbage-tiles. 
<br />
<br />So there will be 24 "not very important"-pixels at the top and bottom, and 16 "not very important"-pixels to the left and right. As long as you can see a few pixels of the walls, that will be fine.
