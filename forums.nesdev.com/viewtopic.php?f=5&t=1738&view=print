<br />I don't know if I should laugh or cry. The reviews are pretty interesting, but the guy sure can speak some nonsense.
<br />
<br />Anyway, take a look... I found it funny!

When he does the style of actually doing film making (like he did on his Friday the 13th and A Nightmare on Elm Street vids), I love it.  Even if I think his opinion sucks haha
<br />
<br />The worst part about him is that it seems like he's into playing older games... having grown up with them (I guess).  But man, sometimes I think he hurts the older gaming.  Maybe I'm being to passionate about it, but damn, it sucks to hear someone putting down cool games like M.C. Kids, Simon's Quest, and others.
<br />
<br />Not to mention, he's inspired a bunch of people to do the same and put down games from back in the day.  Oh well, to each his own I suppose.  More good gaming for me : )

Some of the games he reviews really are terrible pieces of shit but he makes fun of classics too, it's just part of his gimmick. Point of the matter is the videos are funny and that's really all that matters. A lot of times he is really right too; TMNT for example WAS outrageously difficult especially if it's aimed at kids. We're used to it by now but really that game  was devilishly difficult back in the day, and picking it up now it's still goddamn difficult. M.C.Kids, it wasn't really a bad game, it was just weird and a bit mediocre in some areas. And all things considered he didn't give it that bad a review, he complimented it a lot.

<br />
<br />haha, quit trying to instigate with your eye-rolling : P
<br />
<br />Look, _I_ know that alot of the times he's joking, and _you_ know alot of the times he's joking, but most of the Internet is what...?  Stupid punk kids, and you know this.  They cling onto anything with a swear word and think what they hear/see is of biblical proportions.  I guess my wording should've said something about viewership, because it's true.  Go read comments on his vids, and go watch the 20-30 people who jumped on the bandwagon of "angry video reviews."
<br />
<br />I mean, his viewers even went and spammed up Greggman's M.C. Kids page with their comments.  I wish he'd remove them, because it's really piss-poor how these people are so wreckless on the Internet.  Greggman himself commented saying the review by the Nerd was awesome, but I think he was being sarcastic honestly.  It wasn't until 2006 that there was a bad comment on there I believe... hmmm, wonder why ; )
<br />
<br />I'm not slamming the Nerd per se, but his fans are douches... most of them haven't tried the games for themselves.

Look at Homestar Runner - they may not be jerks who spam up people's comments pages, but H*R fanboys are highly obnoxious, obsessive twelve-year-olds who seriously can not talk about anything else without somehow relating it to Strong Bad's emails.

<br />Ha!  I haven't seen that in <strong>years</strong>.  Wasn't even sure HR was still around.  Anyway, to me, the Angry Nerd is good for a quick laugh but gets annoying pretty fast (after about one game "review").

If you look at any video, even some guy eating mentos and diet coke at the same time, there's going to be 900 pages of comments and they'll invariably be shouting racial slurs at each other or talking about how much they hate Jews, Bush or "AmeriKKKa" or shouting incomprehensible bullshit like "Your mom's dick is small". By no means is anyone going to get the wrong idea from the videos and even if they did, if they're someone that incredibly unintelligent do we really even care what they think of any particular subject matter like games that came out over a decade before they were born?

<br />Then you just need an FLV directshow splitter, then the ffdshow video codec.

<br />There are also plenty of pages where you can paste the youtube links and get a direct link to the video file, such as <a href="http://www.youtubex.com/" class="postlink">http://www.youtubex.com/</a>.
<br />
<br />About converting them, it depends on what format you want to convert them to. I have no idea what an "M3" is. But <a href="http://www.erightsoft.net/SUPER.html" class="postlink">SUPER ©</a> seems to be the best all-in-one solution for converting videos. I used it a few times before (even with flv files) and it has never failed me.

<br />Well, FLV is becoming more and more common averyday. The "good" players (GOM Player, VLC) have support for it, and for all other popular formats and codecs, out of the box.
