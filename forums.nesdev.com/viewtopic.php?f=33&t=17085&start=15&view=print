No big deal. <br /><br />But if someone had an entry in the anthology and dedicated its introduction to ruining the intent of <em>somebody elses</em>' work, then that would indeed be poor judgment, with tendencies towards bullying. <br /><br />Just trust the author to know what's best for <em>their</em> work, even if you personally don't see it.<br /><br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">But I am annoyed by the premise that the menu is part of the game</div><br />I don't think anyone says it's part of the game.

After tepples' post I'm forced to make a different assumption.<br /><br />Personally I think the description is OK, but I also think lidnariq's suggestion to make another entry's description a meta commentary on pubby's entry's desription kind of hilarious, and I'd also think that was OK. I'd also think it would be OK if pubby was swayed by others' opinions and decided to change it. It becomes less OK when some authority changes it for him.<br /><br />I would see a clear reason to make editorial decisions about previously discussed content to be avoided (e.g. pornography) but not about something like this, and not after the fact. At this point you're just editing his work because you don't like something rather minor about it. Maybe we'd like it if the character moved faster too? Do we need more starting lives? Maybe we should have someone redo the pixel art to look prettier. I think this really goes against the spirit of this compo to start mucking around with choices like this. I thought the point of this thing was that people will make games for themselves, not for some vague editorial panel.<br /><br />Though on another matter, I would completely understand wanting to reject the entry for being a small copyright violation. I think that bridge was already crossed with Streemerz and several other smaller inclusions, but risks taken in the past don't mean you have to keep taking them in the future. ...but that does come to the point that the person who should have the authority to make <em>that</em> call is the person taking the risk. (NESDev.com for hosting the attached file? InfiniteNESLives for publishing the cartridge?) Who has legal liability?<br /><br />For things that aren't such a strong liability, well there's subjective calls to be made somewhere, and tepples is acting editor of this compilation, but I don't think this is a good place to assert that authority. I think it cuts against what's supposed to be fun about this compo to begin with: to share the game <em>you</em> made yourself. So I think it's better to be sparing with this knife, to keep that encouragement intact.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />All the way too many bits I've spent on this basically come down to these two things:<br /><br />In my opinion, having the menu be complicit in the deception as to what the game is, is what bothers me. If there were no menu, and without context I'd just played the NES file? Yeah, great! (But if I'd bought it from a store? that would be 'return it and get my money back' time. Hence my point that &quot;a large-scale publisher would rightly say no&quot;)<br />In my opinion, this entry isn't a <em>remake</em> of the original ... uh, turd ... by any reasonable definition.<br /><br />There are lots of ways to rephrase things that I think retain all, or almost all, of the enigma without pre-setting the expectation that this was an earnest attempt to remake the original game.<br /><br /><br />As far as the entirely separate question of whether there should be editorial intervention? My point was <em>only</em> that an appeal to authorial intent is a terrible argument. And that changing a hypothetical other entry's text accordingly is a demonstration of what makes it a terrible argument.<br /><br />sniped<br /><br />... ok, pubby wins one internet from me with that last comment.<br /><br /><br /><span style="font-size: 50%; line-height: normal">(entirely unrelated: this was my <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motorola_6800" class="postlink">6800</a>th post)</span>

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />@tepples<br />Just because you fail to see the merit in the work doesn't give you the authority to change it. I feel that you've been *far* out of line since the initial alteration, and even further out of line with each additional post you've made in the topic.  You're a skilled programmer, but I doubt many who support A53 are doing so to experience &quot;your version&quot; of the games included.<br /><br />@lidnariq<br />I think it's time to stop &quot;playing house&quot; and acknowledge that this is *not* &quot;a large scale publisher&quot;, it is a small, hobbysit project from hobbyist developers. One of the main appeals of A53 is the fact that it is independent. The work included is from independent devleopers who offer to include their content essentially for free. Moreover, if it were a largescale publisher, the author would be financially compensated in exchange for their rights over the content.<br /><br />Even if it were a larger scale &quot;corporate, big co.&quot; production, anthologies are *exactly* where risks are taken that wouldn't otherwise be taken if work were published individually. This is especially true in the comics field, such as in Brandon Graham's Island or longer running anthologies like AD 2000, or Strange Tales, Marvel's anthology of independent creators' takes on their characters. If some people are disappointed by *one work* in an anthology, they're far less likely to regret their purchase (not like this isn't being distributed digitally for free anyway).

It sets a bad precedent that I think will discourage participation in the long run.<br /><br />It's one thing to ask or suggest a submitter to voluntarily change their work and leave it up to them, and it's an entirely different thing to insist on replacing or altering their work. If you're going to pull authority to do something like that, you should have a <em>much stronger</em> reason to do so than this particular menu text, because whatever benefit you think you're creating by making the change you are offsetting by harming the creative will of the submitter.<br /><br />That creative will is why they submitted in the first place.<br /><br /><br />...though it's entirely possible that tepples was just making a joke (hard to tell), in which case there was probably no reason for me to respond.
