<br />
<br />I am getting the following error code:
<br />013h - PHP/flags failure (misc bit states)
<br />
<br />That's not very descriptive/specific...especially "misc bit states"??  I'm reviewing my code now, but thought maybe I'd just put up this post in case someone had a quick answer. All PHP does is push the status register to the stack right? I don't see how I could be mucking up something so simple...
<br />
<br />Does nestest take into account that the BCD flag is not used in the NES version of the 6502? I'm wondering if that's the problem...?

It also pushes the status register to the stack. It might have something to do with bits 5 and 4, which aren't very well understood among programmers because they aren't really used on an NES. Bit 5 seems to always be 1, and bit 4 has something to do with the BRK instruction.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">Does nestest take into account that the BCD flag is not used in the NES version of the 6502?

<br />The BCD flag (bit 3) is still stored; it's just not used by ADC and SBC.

<br />That site states: "The status register doesn't implement bits 4 and 5."
<br />
<br />I know that bit 5 is always '1' - this is true even in all 6502's.  But is it correct to say that bit 4 (the BRK or "software interrupt" flag) is not implemented??  I'm pretty sure it is implemented even in the NES' version of the 6502.  And the site even contradicts itself just below that when it says that bit 4 is set when a BRK instruction is executed (which is correct).
<br />
<br />Can someone clarify?

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />The status register remembers the values of the various flags. Whenever an NMI, IRQ, BRK, or PHP occurs, bits 4 and 5 of the byte written to the stack are set to values based entirely on whether it was an NMI/IRQ, or BRK/PHP that is occurring. Bits 4 and 5 aren't based on anything else, nothing that occurred before that has any effect, thus there is nothing to remember in the status register. To talk of these bits existing in the status REGISTER would be like saying that the status register also has a million other hidden flags that it remembers, but that you can't ever actually examine in any way. All the books and web pages that document the Break flag as existing in the status register result in regular confusion for people trying to examine that non-existent flag by using PHP and then PLA.

Now I just need to fix it...

I am failing _all_ of kevtris' "Illegal Ops" tests. :'(   And yes, I know it should really be called "Unofficial ops". <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />
<br />
<br />Problem is...where the heck do I find the documentation for each of these undocumented opcodes?! Haha.  I would need to know the exact number of cycles required for each instrux and exactly what is supposed to happen during each of those clock cycles.  Does this document exist??

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />So I've implemented bits 4 &amp; 5 as directed on the website. Bit 5 doesn't exist but is always pushed to the stack as '1'.  Bit 4 doesn't exist but is pushed to the stack as '1' during PHP/BRK and pushed as '0' otherwise.  Since I made this change I now pass all of the Nestress.nes ROM's CPU tests.  It didn't used to pass the status register test but now it does.  This is good.  But I cannot for the life of me get Kevtris' "Flag tests" to pass in his nestest.nes ROM.  No matter what I do it keeps giving me the 13h error. What the heck?? Does anyone have any ideas? Because I'm fresh out. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />
<br />
<br />Are there any other CPU test ROMs that will test the status register and give me a more detailed error message?

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />SUCCESS!!! So I remembered that someone had made that nestest run log file that I could compare to my CPU cycles and register statuses.  So I did that and noticed that the ALU was clearing a flag bit that it should not have been.  It was a design flaw and an incredibly idiotic error on my part - the erroneous HDL was actually the result of a Vim regex search and replace that I did a while back in my ALU. Tsk tsk. And I'm usually always so careful when I do that kind of thing.  Oh well, at least it works now and thanks so much to whoever made that log file.
<br />
<br />@Blargg, even though your suggestion wasn't the actual problem I really appreciate your reply and trying to help.

<br />
<br />Can someone tell me what the CYC and SL numbers in the nestest.log file are, and (if it's not obvious) how they should be generated?  They seem to count up for a little while and then reset sometimes.  I am working on having my emu generate an identical type of log file so that I can compare my CPU and to allow for _significantly_ easier debugging.
