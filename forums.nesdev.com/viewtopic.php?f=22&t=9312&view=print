		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />i have 7 .nam files with corresponding .pal files i would like to code into a rom that would play in sequence along with my original .nsf's. The screens all use the same .chr file which is 4 pages long, and the nsf's only use 20a3 channels and no dpcm. It's Very similar idea to Alex Mauer and no-carrier's vegavox 2, but with static images instead of scrolling logos. <br /><br />So my question is would anybody be able to sew this all together for me? I unfortunately have little to no experience with programing. all the, .chr, .pal, .nam, and .nsf are organized in a numerical sequence within a single folder to make it as easy as i could to code.<br /><br />I've spent a lot of time trying to make the music and artwork good enough that someone would want to code this thing just to have their name on the credits, but im also prepared to exchange code for cash.<br /><br />here's a preview of one of the tunes along with a music video i made which was really a biproduct of the artwork.<br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SI5l8DRo0ec">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SI5l8DRo0ec</a><!-- m --><br /><br /><img src="http://i1092.photobucket.com/albums/i408/chazbc24/number5.jpg" alt="Image" /><br /><br />Thank you all in advance for your time.<br /><br />chaz,<br /><!-- e --><a href="mailto:chazbc24@gmail.com">chazbc24@gmail.com</a><!-- e -->

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I will try (perhaps others can also try, and we can see who ends up doing what!). One thing that may help is the source code for the Famitracker playback engine so that we may know how to properly call init and playback and detect when it has stopped, and to know what ROM and RAM is free for other use.<br /><br />Do you have idea to select a mapper? If not, I could try to look in wiki to select one that has the ideal bankswitching which is most useful for this, while being otherwise simple.<br /><br />EDIT: I have looked at mappers; perhaps SFROM is OK. I looked at the .NSF in hex editor and it seems OK (the ROM addresses not used by any of these NSF can be used for the rest of the program, including nametables); 16K CHR is then good enough. I would still need to know what RAM is used but I could test that in the emulator too; it can display the contents of RAM while playing NSF files (and even allow them to be edited). But there is still one more thing: To know when the song ends. Looking at the wiki for FamiTracker, it appears to lack a direct write command. If the FamiTracker playback engine is known well enough perhaps there is some way to detect. There is a halt command; will that do?<br /><br />However, I have a question: Why some nametable files are larger than others (especially 2.nam)?

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I honestly don't know how SFROM differs from the much more common SLROM. Are you picking SFROM just because it allows for less CHR-ROM? You can use less CHR-ROM in <strong>any</strong> board, the wiki lists the smaller values for SFROM likely because Nintendo used ROMs of that size, but as a general rule the CHR column in that wiki page lists the <strong>maximum</strong> CHR size, you can always use less than what's specified there.<br /><br />Still, I don't know why use the MMC1 while you could just use simpler discrete logic mappers. UNROM, one of the simplest and most common mappers would probably work just fine, you'd just have to update the CHR-RAM manually, instead of using CHR-ROM with bankswitching.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Yes I did pick SFROM because it allows for less CHR ROM and has 32K PRG banks (I was trying to find a discrete logic mapper doing these things but failed). UNROM uses 16K PRG banks, and I think 7.nsf is too large to fit in 16K. The required CHR is also 16K (the actual file is larger but has junk at the end), and only 8 banks are possible. I do not yet have 6.nsf so I don't know how large that one is; otherwise UOROM might work since it can store all the nametables and pattern tables in other banks, and use the first part of the last (fixed) bank for the part in 7.nsf which exceeds $C000, and then there is enough space for the program as well in the fixed bank. Although, UNROM with banked CHR ROM might work too (saving 16K of PRG ROM), if it can be used.<br /><br />A custom discrete logic mapper would work too, as follows: Have 256K PRG ROM (bank size 32K) and 16K CHR ROM (bank size 4K or 8K, either one works). When writing anywhere into $8000-$CFFF, use bits 0 to 3 to select a PRG ROM bank, and bits 4 and 5 to select a CHR ROM bank (in a bit similar way to UNROM). However, iNES, UNIF, and NES 2.0 do not support custom mappers; only DotFami does, and no emulators support DotFami (especially since the document is not complete, how can you have a specification to emulate?). In addition, I don't know how difficult it is to build your own mapper board, or if they even want to do that, etc.<br /><br />But let's chazbc24 to decide too (his private message to me does say he wants to build cartridges). (Of course, anyone else who knows answers to what I have written, should also please reply to tell me if I did anything wrong.)<br /><br />EDIT: I looked at wiki again, maybe mapper 240 might work? It is similar to the custom mapper I described above, except that the PRG bank and CHR bank bits are switched around. I do not know the name of mapper 240; the article does not say what it is.
