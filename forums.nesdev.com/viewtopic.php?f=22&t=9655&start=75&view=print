If anybody wants the code though now that the game's out in the wild I'd be happy to share it privately at the very least.

There was a special branch of fceux I had used, but then I think those changes were baked into the latest version as I'm pretty sure I'm using 2.2.3 at the moment.<br /><br />I find it amusing some emulators are a bit more lenient about that sort of thing. Like if UnROM boards from the past only ever had say 8 or 16 PRG roms, but then a rom says I want mapper 2 but 32 PRG roms, some emulators are like: &quot;Welp, don't know what board YOU were using but sure, why not?&quot; (Like, Nestopia has always worked with this config for me)

I'd hesitate to say Owlia is truly story-driven. It's got &quot;a&quot; story, but it's not exactly deep as you will find out. It's more of a linear action-adventure than what you may be expecting. Originally I had been imagining a sprawling open world, but for a wide variety of reasons I wound up constraining it quite a bit. I'm in this for the long haul though so I very well may have a longer rpg/adventure like game in the future...(currently working on another platformer though)

I think all programmers experience that, and even worse in professional projects where you just want to get to the results. Honestly it doesn't matter how much spaghetti code you end up with, if the end result is good without obvious problems. In my world, programming isn't about following perfect patterns and creating ingenious algorithms, as much as it's about creating something from your imagination.<br /><br />If you don't feel confident about your code, I don't think there's any reason to share it though. Personally I'm never comfortable sharing code that wasn't initially written as a part of a team project. It's not that it's embarassing, or I'm trying to protect any thing - it just feels personal to me.
