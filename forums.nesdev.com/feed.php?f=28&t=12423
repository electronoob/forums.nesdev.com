It looks like you've got two flash chips on small PCBs (presumably that's the TSOP stuff?) stacked atop one another before being soldered to the mainboard.  How exactly does the underlying hardware work with that, e.g. say both chips were 8mbit, how given that configuration would one be able to access the first chip vs. the second, especially if they share the same pins?<br /><br />This isn't the only place I've seen this done; I've seen commercial motherboards or random consumer products where literally two DRAM or flash chips are stacked on top of one another before being soldered to the board, but I have no idea how this actually manages to work.</div><br /><br />Mark already covered this pretty well, but I'd also like to mention that this is basically exactly how boards with 2 ROM chips or even ROM + SRAM work, but they just use board traces to connect instead of stacking.  The thing is, when you use 2 identical chips, all of the pins that you want to connect together just so happen to be in the same place, so you can stack them in order to connect them.  They share the same exact address and data bus, the only difference is the chip select pin (or sometimes the output enable is used instead, Nintendo seemed to swap /CS and /OE whenever they felt like it because it really didn't matter for MaskROMs).  You do have to lift the chip select pin on the top ROM, because (as the name suggests), that's how you select which chip actually drives the data bus.  So that's the part you probably missed in seeing all of the other pins connected together.  The chip select signal is still separate for each chip, which are then connected separately to the mapper.<br /><br />The way memory-mapped I/O works from a hardware perspective is that you have a shared address and data bus for all of the chips, then you have 3 control signals, write enable (/WE), output enable (/OE, you can also think of this as a read enable, in contrast to write enable), and chip enable (/CE, aka chip select, /CS).  Sometimes you will also see a CE2 on SRAM, but what that actually does is that you tie it to the Vcc rail through a pull-up resistor and it disables the chip until the voltage rail is stable, so while it is a secondary chip enable, you would not use it as a chip <em>select</em>.  It's sometimes referred to as /RST instead.  /OE and /WE can be connected between all of the chips on the board if you want, but you need a separate /CE for each one.  If you want to read from a chip, you set the address bus, pull /CE low on the specific chip you want to read from, then pull /OE low and /WE high to indicate a read, at which point (after a propagation delay) you can read the data off the data bus.  A write is similar, set up the address, set up the data bus, pull /CE low on the chip, then /WE low and /OE high.  Any chip with /CE high simply doesn't respond to the /OE and /WE signals, so that's why it's ok for those two to be shared, and it's why you don't get bus conflicts despite all the different chips on the board (assuming everything is working correctly, and also it's worth noting that this is the same bus used internally by everything inside the console as well, the cart slot is just an extension of that bus).  So now, you have multiple chips on one board and you want them to be mapped to certain address ranges.  That's where the mapper comes in.  It basically just taps into the address lines, and then based on what address you put on the address bus, it selects the proper chip and sets the /CE outputs properly.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=5348">qwertymodo</a> — Wed Mar 11, 2015 10:12 am</p><hr />

Basically, multiple memory parts (roms, srams, etc) all share the same address lines and data lines. So you can stack them because they All share the same buss lines.  The OE and CE pins (output enable and chip enable) lines are controlled by a decoder - or I like to refer to them as traffic cops.  They make it so only 1 memory part can be active at any 1 time.  Can't have 2 memories talking at the same time.  Buss contention.  So when the CE or OE lines are pulled high, it makes that memory invisible to the buss.  That's called tristate. So stacking the chips is just an efficient way to buss the lines (except the oe and sometime CE).  Most of the time, the CE lines are bussed also so only the OE line is used to enable or disable the memories via the traffic cop (decoder).  It's no different than having them all in-line with traces.<br />Because the ExHiRom games add another rom to the buss, a decoder has to be added to control when the 2 TSOP roms output.  My little pcb in the video above has a decoder already on the pcb so it's just a matter of setting a few jumper to configure the tsop's.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=5779">Markfrizb</a> — Wed Feb 25, 2015 1:08 am</p><hr />

This cart wasn't made for seasoned pros.  It was made so anyone, even those with little experience, or they don't quite know how to wire in a decoder or know where to source the TSOP adapter (poor in quality as they are - the buy-ic ones) or don't have the tools to desolder mask ROMS or don't know which donor to use for xyz game.  And I've built ExHiRom games and star ocean on donors.... It is so much easier to burn 2 roms, install and your done on the cart creation pcb vs getting 2 Tsop boards, adding a decoder &amp; wiring it all up.   Even my latest Tsop adapter that has a built on decoder, the cart creation pcb  is still easier to use vs using a donor.  However, making a single Rom game using my Tsop adapter that marries to the back side of a mask Rom is pretty damn easy too.  <br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://youtu.be/5QefJWQ12u4">http://youtu.be/5QefJWQ12u4</a><!-- m --><p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=5779">Markfrizb</a> — Tue Feb 24, 2015 10:40 pm</p><hr />
