		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Here's my terse response: why would you want this?<br /><br />And my more detailed response: I think what you're really asking is: has anyone tried doing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-two_pull_down" class="postlink">3:2 pulldown</a> (or alternately 2:3) on the NES... which I'm not sure is even possible.  There's no real &quot;conversion&quot; going on (i.e. source vs. output), so I think you'd be limited to this method:<br /><br />Given that NMI is usually tied to VBlank (called 60 times a second (NTSC) or 50 times a second (PAL)), achieving exactly 24fps would have to be simulated by keeping track of every time VBlank got called + do some math to determine if you should update data (nametables, etc.) for the upcoming screen refresh/draw or choose to do nothing (for that frame).<br /><br />What you'd end up with visually on-screen would be a sort of stuttering or a sort of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telecine#Telecine_judder" class="postlink">telecline judder</a>.  The stuttering would look different on NTSC than PAL too (60/24 = 2.50 vs. 50/24 = 2.08).  The visual results I imagine would look like crap.<br /><br />And technically it's 23.976fps, but I say that to keep tepples happy.  ;)

Animate at 12.02 fps (5 field pulldown) on NTSC or 12.50 fps (4 field pulldown) on PAL and you should be fine.

But you also have to consider that the NES doesn't output video at 60fps either, it's slightly faster than that.<br /><br />I don't see any real complexity in animating at film rate on the NES, you just need a fixed-point accumulator being updated every frame to indicate when it's time to move on to the next frame. I don't think the stutter would be too noticeable either, but we'd need some kind of test to verify that.

The film itself runs at 24 FPS, but the cel changes rarely gets that fluid, for the most part it is on twos or threes, i.e. 12 or 8 cel changes per second.

Then, on the next frame, I made the second darkest colors darker. Then the third darkest colors, and finally the brightest colors. This means it took 4 frames to darken the whole palette by 1 step (a regular fading sequence would've already ended in this many frames). Then I handled the remaining 3 brightness levels, then 2, then the last one. In the end, instead of a 4-step fade sequence you get a 10 step one (4 + 3 + 2 + 1).

I'm more suggesting looking for cheaply/hasilty made ports maybe... though honestly I would be surprised if anything used 24fps. I'm just trying to think of the most likely place if it does exist.
