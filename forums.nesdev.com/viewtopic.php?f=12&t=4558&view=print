		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Yeah, aside from the obvious "can never achieve perfect accuracy" problem -- all emulators suffer from ~16-48ms video output latency, ~30-120ms audio output latency, and ~16-48ms controller input latency. Not to mention the forced resampling of audio if you want to avoid video tearing, and the unnatural video interpolation to preserve the aspect ratio.
<br />
<br />While it's not really noticeable in isolation, you can definitely feel it side-by-side with the real system.
<br />
<br />Who knows, maybe in 10 years we'll have FPGA-like devices that can run C++-like code, and we can create cheap, easy-to-produce hardware devices with no latency issues.

<br />I think a fpga-based snes clone is already feasible nowadays.
<br />Some time ago, I found <a href="http://crystal.freespace.jp/pgate1/snes/index.html" class="postlink">this</a>.
<br />I contacted the guy thinking that he directly implemented the SNES hardware low-level style, but IIRC, he ported SNES9x to some CPU core running on the FPGA.
<br />I could be confusing this with another project, though.

<br />A few years back I heard some guy had a bunch of pirated Nintendo Entertainment Systems. According to the rumor he went to prison. 
<br />I don't know if it was true, 
<br />But I remember some time in the 90's Some other guy was charged with piracy 'cause he was selling, giving away (I don't know) the complete schematics to the Famicom. I think he even had places to get the parts listed. I don't remember too much. If someone can help me out?

<br />That might have been reasonable until the mid-2000s, when the Famicom/NES patents expired.

And even once you get good at it, it does no real good: nobody else is going to go through all that trouble to build their own.<br /><br />My idea would be something of a hybrid between a PC and an FPGA. Give you multiple processors (so you don't have to use multi-tasking to simulate parallelism) with a high enough clock to divide down to rough estimates of standard 90's era systems.<br /><br />Have a really, really light API to help control the hardware (video, audio, input -- connection interface details, eg memory card reader, HDMI, S/PDIF, controller ports -- are handled for you), with a focus on minimal latency. Drive the video and audio on per-pixel/sample clock rates ... get a certain memory address to hold the value you want, and make sure it's ready in time. Input polled from the controllers would also be done in real time. With a real-time OS, and known cycle overhead per operation, that shouldn't be too hard. Ideally, it'd be like blargg's S-DSP core: concrete "do this on this cycle" steps, and there'd be no need for things like semaphores or locks.<br /><br />Worst case, buffer it a tiny bit if needed. Just nothing like to up to ~75ms video, ~120ms audio we get on PCs now.<br /><br />Essentially like an open console, but with lower-level timing control.

<br />
<br />The only one I remember reading about was the (albeit very successful until he was sued) idiot selling NES-on-a-chip N64-knockoff controllers with ~30 copyrighted NES ROMs on-board. He got sued because of the games included.
<br />
<br />It would be interesting to try selling such a device with only a memory stick slot, so users can load games themselves.

<br />
<br />In many cases, emulation is simply better. It's far more portable, saves an incredible amount of space, can do things like netplay, and using a mouse for super scope games is simply better than the unwieldy super scope itself. I grew up playing PC games, so crisp pixelated graphics look better to me than blur. And bsnes effectively has better audio than the original unit by avoiding the analog output. I don't want to hear any nonsense about developer intent in that regard. It's just a cheaper, inferior pathway in a day when digital ones were uncommon, that's all there is to it.
