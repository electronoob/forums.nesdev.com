<br />It started with the fact that it's grossly insecure and bloated. Even if the security holes are as fixed as they claim in 7, it's still, by the accounts in this thread, just as slow and bloated as ever. And to top it off, Mozilla Firefox is pretty much a work-alike, a billion times more secure, and faster. About the only thing you need IE for is a few stupid sites (I'm lookin' at <em>you,</em> coursecompass,) which require proprietary plugins which aren't provided for Firefox.

<br />
<br />ugh, this is the main reason I won't use IE anymore.  I don't even check anything I make in IE at all now.  If my site was up right now, I'd have you take a look at the difference in the two browsers, with the proper CSS and all.  It seems that all Microsoft cares about is making anything they think of as a standard, even if it hasn't been approved/initiated by the W3C yet.  I find it hard to believe that M$ can't get their browsers to render properly, yet almost EVERY OTHER browser out their can.  Hell, I'd rather use Off-By-One before IE, and I'm no fan of that program either.

<br />So true !
<br />What is so fun is that Microsoft's site seem to be 100% compatible with the W3C HTML and CSS standards, while any site made with Microsoft Front Page has at least 1000 errors. Isn't that funny ?

<br />
<br />Just reword it in terms of emulators it becomes obvious why this doesn't let IE off the hook:
<br />
<br />"I don't kick Nesticle... No clue, but there are a few homebrew games, mainly some older ones, that only runs on Nesticle, giving an odd error on Nintendulator."
<br />
<br />Translation: many sites only work in IE because they are broken in a way that matches how IE is broken.

<br />That's because IE doesn't clear the VBlank flag, and Firefox does. &gt;_&lt;
