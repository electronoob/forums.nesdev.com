Even if you are a good programmer with experience of making games for modern platforms, moving to the NES could be hard because of the system's limitations. So if you want to make NES games, having a large amount of patience and dedication would be a good help.<br /><br />And <a href="http://www.nintendoage.com/pub/faq/NA/nerdy_nights_out.html" class="postlink">here</a> is a typically recommended place to start.

Hex Workshop is a common one. Graphics editors again are all over. If you can &quot;edit&quot; graphics then clearly you can create them too. They are just as suited to game creation as editing. Making a blank NES ROM? Making a blank file, is nothing special. Managing a iNES header isn't either. Finally, easy coding tools? What does that even mean? <br /><br />Do you understand programming at all? And bear in mind I don't mean this in a way to seem insulting. Programming is just typing code. While modern languages and libraries can do alot for you, the NES isn't like that. The NES is very basic. But that shouldn't be taken to mean easy. If you cannot program a game on some other platform in a high level language like BASIC, you shouldn't even bother with the NES yet. For one thing, being able to write a level editor or other data building program on the PC is very helpful in making a game. Then ofcourse, learning how to program a game while also trying to learn how to program the NES, and even just learning how to program in the first place.. the NES is not where to start. <br /><br />Everything a programmer could need to make a NES game is out there now. There is a wealth of information and tools. But that doesn't mean that anyone with no skills can make a NES game. You still have to be a programmer to program.

There are loads of good examples to make a simple nes program. You can find them by using google.<br /><br />Best way for me to understand NES programming was to first find out how example code works, and then create own programs from scratch using the things I learned from the examples. Learning new things is always very tedious process and you can't expect that you would learn everything necessary for making a NES game in one day.<br /><br />Also I would recommend to use minimal anmount of tools for learning the basics, because it will teach you more. Most important thing is that you try to understand what you are doing. If you don't understand how your own program works, it would be better to first learn what it actually does than extend it. It will be really hard to make a game using copy-paste programming.
