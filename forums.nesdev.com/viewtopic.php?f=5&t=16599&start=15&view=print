However, MIDI can be use for many things, not only music.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />On further reflection I think it was CD audio that killed MIDI.  Once games could just use Red Book audio for free, there seemed to be no point improving MIDI playback.  (And it was literally Red Book audio - you could pop X-Wing vs. TIE Fighter into your stereo, skip to Track 2, and just kick back and listen to John Williams' Greatest Hits.)  The SoundBlaster Live! took the whole thing through a hard left turn where instead of better default playback (which it had), the draw was amateur music production using SoundFont and EAX.  By the time the amateur music scene rejected the Audigy and SoundFont 2.1 in favour of VST, the idea of 'better sound card = better MIDI playback' was already dead.<br /><br />And it's not like we can't do better.  Leaving aside movie-grade orchestra sets that ship on hard drives, there are loads of amateur soundfonts that prove you can crush Microsoft GS with a couple dozen megabytes of samples, and even beat a professional hardware synth under some circumstances.  Imagine what a professionally balanced GS set targeted to modern PC resources could sound like!

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />As far as games go, that's probably right.<br /><br />By 1999, General MIDI 2 was declared, mostly to cover for deviations in roland and yamaha keyboard products. But by then, the window for GM was steadily shrinking as software synths became more and more competent/viable, along with DSP cards entering the music production market. <br /><br />GM2 largely seems to have lived out its days as a provisional composition/arrangement tool for scores meant to be recorded by ensembles anyway.<br /><br />Plain, open ended MIDI is of couse indispensible in music/studio production. I cannot understand why adobe decided to drop MIDI support from its audio workstation software. Not that they get mentioned a lot in music/studio circles, but since it's part of the bundle, it would've been an option if they hadn't arbitrarily downgraded it.

In the Sekaiju zip file, look in the instrument folder for Microsoft_GS_Wavetable_Synth.ins. It's a plain text format that tells the sequencer the what names to display when you change the program, bank MSB (CC 0), and bank LSB (CC 32) numbers. It also has drum note names, controller names, and registered parameter names. However, the comments at the beginning of the file explain the developer (kuzu) gathered the information from the internet:<br /><br /><blockquote style="margin-left: 1%; padding-left: 1%; border-left: 3px solid #555577;">
; This list is based on uncertain information on the Internet.<br />; First, Microsoft does not publish the specification of MSGS.<br />; Therefore, this list may be wrong.
</blockquote><br /><br />B. If the Microsoft GS Wavetable Synth contains the SC-55 sound set, then the program and bank listing in the SC-55 manual may be another starting point: <a href="https://www.roland.com/us/support/manual_archive/" class="postlink">Roland Manual Archive</a>, <a href="http://cdn.roland.com/assets/media/pdf/SC-55_OM.pdf" class="postlink">Roland SC-55 Owner's Manual</a> (PDF).<br /><br /><br />Using Bregalad's tip, I made an example MIDI file that plays the &quot;GS Reset&quot; system exclusive message and the four gunshot variations. I can hear these variations on my Windows 8.1 computer.<br /><br />Note: Sekaiju and the .ins file use program numbers between 0 and 127. (Gunshot is 127.)<br />The SC-55 manual uses program numbers between 1 and 128. (Gunshot is 128.)<br /><br /><div class="attachtitle">Attachment:</div><div class="attachcontent">

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" /><div class="quotetitle">pokun wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">So midi is still used a lot in the music production process even though the final audio data in games are normally PCM.</div><br /><br />Definitely. Consider the time before MIDI. Every single instrument/ensemble had to be recorded by live/studio musicians. That sort of manual labour gets really expensive quickly; especially for &quot;large sound&quot; productions common in pop music and soundtracks. You want strings? Then you got to pay for a group of people rehearsing and playing it, a full-feature studio and an engineer to record it. The alternative (voltage controlled synthesizers) were expensive and had limited composing capabilities at this point. Because of this, MIDI is often credited for saving the record industry in the 80:s. It is still integral and indispensible to any sort of music production not reliant on a minimalist performer setup, such as a singer-songwriter or a basic setup rock band.<br /><br />It is also responsible for the longevity of certain styles. While there were examples of hip hop, synth pop and numerous subspecies of electronic dance music prior to the launch of MIDI, that's what made them explode.<br /><br />But at the same time, i know for a fact that the soundtrack for Breath of the Wild was performed by studio musicians on acoustic instruments, so apparently, some dev houses have the budget for that.The fact that the backbone of BotW is played on piano probably mitigates the cost by some. MIDI probably played some role as a compositing tool (any notation program ususally builds on MIDI).<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">I see, midi is more versatile than I thought.</div><br />On one hand (for musical purposes), the MIDI standard is almost perfect. It's still version 1.0, because there has never been a need for additional features or restructuring so great that it overrules the need for a consistent standard for communication between instruments. There has been some plugin-type standards (GM, GM2, super speed variants) but original MIDI has outlived them all.<br /><br />On the other, it  is clearly limited because it is designed around the piano/keyboard as the main interface, which isn't a particularily well-suited interface for sound synthesis. It's just that way because of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Path_dependence" class="postlink">path dependence</a> (for example, the piano keyboard has traditionally been many composers' go-to tool because of its wide range, digitized notes, see-all layout and neutral tone). Buchla-style synths, ribbon controllers, theremins, other modernist instruments or any fretless traditional instrument, or even drums - all these need more or less cumbersome workarounds to be played properly via MIDI. In some cases, a good enough compromise can be achieved, but in some other, it's not worth the hassle. Additionally, there are also other ways of composing music and sound that just doesn't fit the way MIDI is structured - The reemergence of modular and/or voltage controlled/controlling interfaces and instruments in the last ~15 years speak for the need for covering this gap.<br /><br />For other purposes than music, there's often a better standard. MIDI *can* control (certain) light rigs and relays, but DMX does it more robustly and can send 512 slots of channel data, each one byte long with each frame, though it has a slower frame rate than MIDI iirc. The &quot;fast&quot; frame rate of MIDI is wasted on light rigs.
