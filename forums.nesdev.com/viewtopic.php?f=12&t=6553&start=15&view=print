		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I decided that it'd be a good idea to use as much of the dynamic range of P as possible. So I now calculate my LUT the following way:
<br />
<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">&nbsp; &nbsp;p = floor&#40;f * 16 / 7.8125&#41;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;if p &lt; #1000 then<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;p = floor&#40;f * 64 / 7.8125&#41; + #8000<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;elsif p &gt;= #4000 then<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;p = #3FFF<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;end if<br /></div>
<br />
<br />All I need to do then when my player code loads the high byte of a value from the table is to check the negative flag. If set, it picks a sample 4 times as wide and clears bit 15.
<br />
<br />The results can be quite noticable, as can be heard in this song from Alex Kidd in Miracle World:
<br />
<br /><a href="http://jiggawatt.org/muzak/akimw-old.spc" class="postlink">.SPC (old frequency table)</a>
<br /><a href="http://jiggawatt.org/muzak/akimw-new.spc" class="postlink">.SPC (new frequency table)</a>
<br /><a href="http://jiggawatt.org/muzak/akimw.vgm" class="postlink">.VGM for reference</a>
<br />
<br />With the new table it obviously sounds much more like the original.

<br />
<br />Command goes on Port 1, and issuing that command, goes onto port 0.
<br />
<br />If a command is valid,  what is written to port 0, is echoed back, otherwise it is not echoed back.  Regardless of whether the value is echoed back, next command to be issued has to have a new value written to port 0.
<br />
<br />Valid Commands are
<br />
<br />0x21 - Restart Playback of current song
<br />0x22 - Pause / Resume playback
<br />0x23 - Stop Playback, and start standard IPL loader.  New song is loaded using standard IPL protocol.
<br />0x24 - Unknown command
<br />0x30-0x3F - Set master Volume
<br />0x40 - Toggle Tone Channel 1
<br />0x41 - Toggle Tone Channel 2
<br />0x43 - Toggle Tone Channel 3
<br />0x44 - Toggle Noise Channel
<br />0x45-0x4F - no known effect, but is treated as valid.
<br />
<br />Port 2 and 3 contains the 4 channel visualizers, one channel per nybble.  In terms of the driver, Port 2-3 are never written to, only read from,  except when using the IPL loader.
<br />
<br />When a new song is to be loaded,  IPL load song to 0x1700, max size 0xE8C0.  When done, IPL jump to 0x0300.  Issue command 0x21,  new song starts playing.

<br />When repeat mode is disabled in the GUI I want to know from the playback driver when the song has looped (which it does by modifying the value on port0), so that I can stop it and load the next song. When repeat is enabled I tell the playback driver to not send any such notifications. Command 0x24 toggles a flag in the playback driver which determines if it should send loop notifications or not.

<br />Yeah, I've thought about YM too. They use LZH IIRC. Perhaps they can be compressed in some other way that's easier to unpack, like I did with the VGM files in my player. And/or you could stream the data from ROM if you don't need to do anything else on the S-CPU.
<br />
<br />Another possibility would be SAP (Atari XL/XE music, for the POKEY chip). It's an executable format, but it's a 6502-based system. And the files are usually tiny.

<br />
<br />POKEY with SAP format is a cool idea too.  Actually I've been wondering lately how I can make some looped POKEY and 2600 waveforms for my wavetable synth.

I haven't looked at any YM files to see how often they typically change the register values. The fact that you've got 10 different envelope shapes and an adjustable envelope speed means that you might have to waste a bit of memory on samples if you want them to sound good. And I don't know how the "special effects" in v6 of the YM format works (e.g. "SID-voice" and "Sync-buzzer") or how common their use is.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">POKEY with SAP format is a cool idea too.

<br />I started writing a music playback engine for the Atari XE/XL earlier this year, but I haven't finished it yet. POKEY has some quirky features, like the ability to combine channels to get higher precision, and the whole distortion control which I haven't looked too closely on.

<br />Works great! Enabling/disabling channels a lot will cause graphical glitches, however. Screenshots made with bsnes (on the real hardware w/ PowerPak, the glitches were worse).
