I've almost never seen someone target just 16k for a homebrew!<br /><br />For my example you would need to modify PRG to start at $C000 and be of size $4000, then modify CODE to start at $C000. If you want to use DPCM, maybe still start DPCM at $C000 and put CODE after it with no specified start so that it will just fill space between the DPCM segment and the vector table.<br /><br />Or alternatively just specify 2 PRG banks in the header instead of 1 to get a 32k NROM.

That &quot;hardware&quot; reads bytes from it to determine your cartridge configuration, before it starts executing it. It makes sense that it needs its own memory area and segment, since it's no different than say the vectors area.

A 512K cart, for example, can fit 12 NROM-256 games or 20 NROM-128 games (assuming 32K menu and no CHR compression). But if you can't cut your 20K PRG ROM to 16K, don't fret just yet, as some advanced multicart engines  can compress other games' CHR data into the empty space.

Which post suggested to you otherwise? It doesn't have to be at the beginning of the source file, just as the vectors don't have to be at the end, if you've set up appropriate segments.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />There's really no advantage to trying to stick the header into another MEMORY block like the PRG or zero page blocks. That's going beyond simplification into the realm of obfuscation. The header is not part of the PRG-ROM or RAM, it's really just data that substitutes for the physical circuit board of the cartridge, and it belongs in its own semantic space.<br /><br />The MEMORY blocks will appear in the output file in the order they're specified. The data that ends up in the file is exactly the binary data you stick into it via the segments. The only thing the start location is for is to specify the program counter at the start of the block when linking. If you go beyond NROM, and start bankswitching, you will need to have several MEMORY blocks that use the same start location, since you're going to have multiple banks share the same memory space at different times, but the reuse of memory regions isn't a concern to the linker; it will still output each bank on its own in the order specified.<br /><br />Yes, the iNES header needs to go at the start of the file, followed by the specified amount of PRG-ROM data (16k x the number specified), followed by the CHR-ROM data. If things are in the correct locations, the emulator will know where to load them into memory.<br /><br />It is also useful to have segments that do not output to the file for ZP/RAM/WRAM so that you can reserve space on them in your assembly files, and the linker can pack them all together for you. If you don't have MEMORY regions for these things in your config, you will have to assign all of your RAM addresses by hand, and prevent conflicts manually.<br /><br />IMO the &quot;simplest&quot; way is to lay out your MEMORY blocks like your iNES file. There should be a header, 1 block for each PRG bank (not necessarily 1 per 16k, it depends on your mapper, but 1 per bank, for NROM-256 I would suggest 1 x 32k block of PRG), and 1 block for each CHR bank. There should also be a block for each RAM region that does not output to the file (these can go before or after the file blocks). The SEGMENTS can be used to define aligned regions within the blocks as needed (e.g. the vector table).<br /><br /><br />Another funny trick is you can define a segment that will output in the file in one memory block, but be linked with a program counter as if it belongs in a different memory block. Specifically this is useful for code that you need to copy into RAM before running, e.g.:<br /><br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">SEGMENTS {<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; SWAP: load = PRG, run = RAM, type = rw, define = yes;<br />}</div><br /><br />The &quot;load&quot; is where this segment's data will end up in the output file, but the &quot;run&quot; is the memory location it is intended to run at. The &quot;define=yes&quot; creates symbols __SWAP_LOAD__, __SWAP_RUN__ and __SWAP_SIZE__ that are useful for the part of the code that needs to copy it to RAM and run it.
