<br />Anyone ever try this? I tried it on a couple very dirty games and the results were amazing.

<br />
<br />I actually fold a standard post-it note in half 4 times one way, pretty much till you can't fold it in half anymore, then I fold it in half 1 time the other way. Do mind you, I don't have the sticky side out. I hold the two ends of the sticky note in one hand, and I place the folded part in between the pins and the plastic, then I swipe the sticky note back and forth really fast. The sticky note comes out FILTHY! So it gets a lot off, I guess. Does that make any sense? It's kind of hard to explain without showing you.

<br />EDIT: Yeah, also, I do have a 3.8mm gamebit. It was so hard to find one for some reason. I had to get it from an online store in hong kong. Just like the honey bee adapter, I can't find one anywhere.

<br />I just cleaned some more games tonight. I don't notice any of the color fading on the connectors, and the games work just fine. I think it's best to wait until it dries, then polish it off again to get it all off. It is scary - the cloth I used to clean them comes out black. The only place I've seen this stuff for sale is WalMart - and I'd imagine they have one somewhere near you!

<br />
<br />Well I'm glad I know that now.. before I ran through most of my collection. I was hoping someone with some more experience would chime in. Is there any safe types of polish that will work well? Before this I always used alcohol, water and Q-tips - and I guess I might go back to that!

My sticky note method actually gets quite a bit off, because it's a good size, and it is pressing hard against the pins, so as it goes by, it picks up alot of dirt. I'll take a pic of a dirty sticky note sometime. That sounds really funny, but I want to show you all how much dirt it gets off. I tried rubbing alchohol and q-tips, and it just got tiny strands of cotton stuck under the pins. That was bad. Didn't get like any dirt off.

<br />
<br />That's pretty much the "proper" way of cleaning cartridges - cotton swabs and isopropyl alcohol. The problem is that some metal polishes can be abrasive and strip the (incredibly thin) gold plating off of the cart edge, making it far more susceptible to corrosion.
