<br />
<br />
<br />I'm working on a NES compilation for SEGA Dreamcast to be released as part of our DreamEmulation Project series at <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.DCEvolution.net">http://www.DCEvolution.net</a><!-- m --> 
<br />
<br />To get a picture of the direction I am aiming at with this compilation, you could download the SEGA 8bit Edition (SMS/GG/SG1000) we released a few months ago:
<br />
<br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.dcevolution.net/goto.php?id=54">http://www.dcevolution.net/goto.php?id=54</a><!-- m --> [The download is on the left menu]
<br />
<br />
<br />I hereby would like to ask everyone visiting these boards to contribute NES ROMs for inclusion to this collection. Maybe you got a discontinued or recently updated game, demo or intro lying around, unreleased as of yet ? or something that's been overlooked when it's been released ?
<br />
<br />For the case you think that what you have would not be worth a release, I have to say that <em>every</em> piece of code is interesting for me. I'm not looking for commercial games! So, if you 'just' got this NSF player ROM or a small 'Hello World' intro showing your website's url and it's not yet listed on NESdev then that's what I am looking for.
<br />
<br />If you'd include the source code it'd be great, if you'd rather not or just can't find it anymore, then that's fine too.
<br />
<br />For those of you working on complex long-term projects that aren't anywhere near ready for a preview release right now, I'd like to suggest to maybe throw together a little 'Coming soon' demo ROM showing one or more screens and playing a track of the game's OST and thus advertising what you're working on.
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />Okay, back to work for me. ^^ Can't wait to see what you guys come up with !

Most of these do work to varying degrees on some of the less accurate emulators.  You may want to limit your search to code that actually works on HW, or at least document their compatibility so your users don't get confused when it doesn't work.

<br />
<br />Else I can say is that I won't include any ROMs to this release that are not working with FCEUltra and NesterDC. Both emus are pretty comparable compatibility-wise. Selectable via NesterDC are only those games &amp; demos that work with that emu, everything else that's working with FCEUltra but not NesterDC will be added to the PC folders for completeness [pretty much like with the SEGA 8bit Edition that I've linked to above].

<br /><div class="quotetitle">Christuserloeser wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">[...]I won't include any ROMs to this release that are not working with FCEUltra and NesterDC. Both emus are pretty comparable compatibility-wise.</div>
<br />
<br />I have to correct myself on this one. I just did some additional tests with both emus and the games I excluded when I started working on this project in early 2004 and it seems that NesterDC is far more compatible than FCE Ultra. Only those homebrew games &amp; demos from the Nesticle days won't work.
<br />The only drawback is that NesterDC hasn't the same support for (strange &amp; rare) mappers as FCE Ultra.

<br />
<br />There is a HUGE difference between <strong>compatibility</strong> and the ability to run large quantities of homebrew games. Remember, a lot of those homebrew games do not function at all on a real NES.
<br />
<br />I'd highly recommend using Nintendulator for testing - it can be found at <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://nintendulator.sf.net/">http://nintendulator.sf.net/</a><!-- m -->
<br />
<br />[edit: add URL, since the site is back online; seems the only problem all along was that its IP address changed!]

<br />
<br />[Link edited out, check the final download below]
<br />
<br />Burn the image via DiscJuggler, Alcohol 120% (in TAO mode) or using BootDreams by LyingWake:

<br />
<br />If you do not have a CDR at hand you can open the CDI with CDMage.
<br />
<br />
<br />However this is a Dreamcast release and thus the best would be to try it on a Dreamcast before spoiling menus and content via your PC  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=":wink:" title="Wink" />

<br />It plays perfectly I think so I included the Tetris ROM.  I've yet to do a 1:1 comparison tho. - Thanks a lot, I've not noticed this one before.

<br />I included the MP3 (along with your other test ROMs) to the /Source folder.
