I've never had any problems with all the carts I've made.<br />I've mostly used 40 pin IDE cables.

Sounds like fixing these reproductions is more likely when you replace the wire you're reflowing the solder and getting better joints or something like that.<br /><br />I thought about this the other day and recall seeing old IDE cable being used in reproductions that worked just fine. I think D4S did Star Fox like that. And I believe D4S over alot of other people.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=1726">MottZilla</a> — Mon Mar 05, 2012 11:28 am</p><hr />

I've never ran into an SRAM that didn't work as CHR-RAM for FF3j.<br /><br />You have a different problem (which I discovered back in 2001 when I started selling reproductions) I have fixed dozens of "other" reproductions (customers sending me reproductions to fix that have pre-maturely failed) and they all have the exact same problem.<br /><br />THE WIRE YOU USE IS SH*T.<br /><br />You can't use 26, 28, 30, whatever gauge solid core wire in making reproductions! I know it's cheap, but it's wrong.  You have to use multi-strand wire.  Years ago, I was using old IDE cable, but I now have a supplier which sells me spools of the wire.  It resists cross talk better, and you can run it for longer lengths.<br /><br />The problem with the CHR-RAM chip is the CHR enable wire.  It's the longest wire in any reproduction (pin 56 on connector) and picks up a lot of noise, and feeds it into the CHR-RAM chip.<br /><br />Sorry for the rant.. tired of fixing bad eBay reproductions.  <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /></div><br /><br />Ive used 30 gauge wire for years, and never had a problem.

Thick wire, thin wire? Maybe, I don't really know. But one thing I noticed last night was all my test boards use thin wire from IDE cables, and since I got this roll of free network cable I have been using that for my permanent copies.<br /><br />It got me thinking. I flash my chips pop them in the test cart and test, my results are pretty consistent, they work. Then I make my permanent copy, not always the same consistency any more.<br />I am starting to think that since I went to using network cable I have been having less success. <br /><br />Can it really be something as simple as wire thickness, even when dealing with pieces of wire fractions of an inch long to maybe 3 inches long at the most.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=2415">marvelus10</a> — Mon Feb 27, 2012 8:17 pm</p><hr />

Because crosstalk is real and is a issue, modern equipment evolved from parallel buses into low voltage differential designs like for example PCI-Express. But then we're talking about gigabytes per second of transfer rates. At 1.75mhz crosstalk is a non issue, to be very honest.<br /><br />If crosstalk was a issue, the "horrible" things I assemble would either not work at all or glitch a lot.<br /><br />I'm not defending either sides, just citing that what was observed by leon could be something else, such as poor soldering (it's actually harder to solder properly single core conductors as the contact surface for the solder is smaller than that of a multi core conductor).<br /><br />And 80 wire ATA cables do use single core conductors.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=4943">l_oliveira</a> — Sun Feb 26, 2012 10:09 am</p><hr />
