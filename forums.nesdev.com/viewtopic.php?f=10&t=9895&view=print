If not then is there a way to split the routine so that the reset vector loads up the beginning part (first 8 bytes) and then create a pointer or vector to go the rest of the code?

In reality, it's a choice between coding your reset so that in rare circumstances on perhaps rare revisions of the NES, your program state will be slightly different than normal and could trigger an obscure but, or coding your reset so that the NES state is as consistent as possible in all cases so that it any bugs that will manifest will do so on your own hardware more often, or will remain latent. And then during development you can root out things like this by intentionally altering whatever NES state your program's not supposed to be depending on, and see what bugs you bring out reliably.<br /><br />There's also the question of what's a bug and what's by design. If you can place the NES into a consistent state in your reset routine, you have the option of considering code that depends on this buggy or correct. Why would you not consider depending on this state a bug? For the same reason you allow any piece of code to depend on other things being set up beforehand.<br /><br />Regardless of what one considers a bug, it's just asking for Murphy's Law to strike if you don't fully initialize everything in the NES at reset for your release build. You're leaving state around that's available for a bug to pick up and behave in a bad way when some particular value happens to be there, one that happens to come up on someone <em>else's</em> NES. Develop with memory randomization or something, then release with a consistent initialization pattern, so you fix what you can find, then make latent whatever is remaining, or at least make it dependent on what's done after reset, and not what the static RAM and other registers happen to power up with.
