		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I just noticed that *every* commercially available game has beeen PEGI licenced (in europe) or ESRB (in US) since those are the norm.
<br />
<br />I know the only NES game to have any rating is Wario's Wood in the US because it should be the only one released after it was compulsory.
<br />
<br />But how is the ratings compulsory for homebrew games or freeware games ? If the commercial developpers are forced to release, would it make sense that a free downloadable game or a game sold by a particular would not need any rating ? What about if I make a homebrew game that is very violent and have insult, rasism, sex, drugs in it and make it downloadable for free without warning people of that conent ? (of course I don't plan to, this is a hypotetical case).

<br />
<br />My game concept is quite violent for NES standards and contains "mature themes", that's really part of the fun of unlicensed games, getting away with whatever content you want.

Nintendo will not give out NES licenses so that doesn't matter.  Stores want to buy the game for less than the parts cost so that won't happen either.  If you really need it the ESRB license is ~$1K.
<br />
<br />The only warning you may need is for adult-only content where age/pornography laws would be involved.  That wouldn't be anything video game specific.

<br />It may be possible to add a false rating on your website before downloading, corresponding to the content of the game, and it's not likely anyone will notice that. But it could be illegal to do so.
<br />
<br />I've read that it was illegal to use (R) or TM symbols if you did not actually register a trade mark, and that you could have to pay a fee if you are caught doing that. It's fun because I'm pretty sure I have done that at least once without suspecting that. However the use of (C) is free for anyone who wants to copyright one of his creations.

<br />Well, I guess the GBA is still supported by Nintendo, and <em>Final Fantasy VI Advance</em> was released less than two years ago in Europe and close to two years ago in Japan.
<br />However, there is no doubt that the Game Boy and Game Boy Color should be added on the list, and probably the Super NES too (even if it may not have been as much reverse engineered ?).
<br />
<br />And I belive the ESRB is the standard in United States. As Bunnyboy stated, it's not compulsory, which was really a surprise to me. Usually I reconise import games by their rating logo, if it's PEGI I know it's an european game and if it's ESRB I know it's from the US. If I can't make sense of the pictograms on the box, likely it's form japan  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=":wink:" title="Wink" />

<br />
<br />The "TM" doesn't require any sort of registration. It just gives you a stronger claim in a <a href="http://www.uspto.gov/web/offices/tac/tmfaq.htm#Search005" class="postlink">common law trademark</a>, which in the United States is mostly state law. Registration generally happens after the first use of a mark, so you'll often see things change from TM to ® in later editions of a product after registration. Compare Animal Crossing for GameCube (used TM) to Animal Crossing: Wild World for DS (used ®).
<br />
<br /><strong>GBC: Definitely dead, an ex-parrot.</strong>
<br />Nintendo no longer sells significant quantities of hardware capable of playing GBC games. Wikipedia's article about the GBA SP, the last system capable of playing GBC games, states that sales in North America stopped abruptly after the third quarter of 2007, suggesting that it was probably discontinued in favor of the DS Lite for the Christmas season. GBA SP sales continue in "Other" regions though, but just barely: only about 80,000 in the entire third quarter of 2008.
<br />
<br /><strong>GBA: Probably dead.</strong>
<br />In the past 11 months, the warez scene has released only 10 GBA roms, and the most recent scene release of a commercial game (#2809 according to PH) was in mid-April 2008. At this rate, I'd guess the original commercial era of GBA is over. Consider it dead once the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nintendo_DSi" class="postlink">DSi</a> is out worldwide in the second quarter of this year, as DSi doesn't play GBA games or even DS games that use a SLOT-2 controller.
<br />
<br /><strong>Super NES: Not cracked.</strong>
<br />I seem to remember from the CIC reverse engineering topic that the Super NES CIC uses the same microcontroller architecture as the one in the NES, but the program is entirely different and not yet analyzed. So we're limited to prying CICs from original games or using a Super 3D Noah's Ark-style lock-on cart.

<br />And hardware capable of playing GB/GBC/GBA cartridges will continue to be sold as long as garage sales aren't prohibited.
