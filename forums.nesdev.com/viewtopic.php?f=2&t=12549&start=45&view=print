But would this work if the controller II was unplugged?<br /><br />Is the differences regarding the con II reading values being different (A, B, 0, 0, Up, Down, Left, Right instead of A, B, Select, Start, Up, Down, Left, Right) a result of differences on the main board or is this encoder chip inside the controller itself? So if I were to connect a controller I in the controller II port, would Start and Select work? Not sure I understood everything correctly though.

It may be the last to support lidnariq's board. One limit I thought of while coding it is that slowly reading a serial line and quickly reading instructions to select a serial line kind of conflict with each other, especially on controllers where a strobe pulse has side effects (Arkanoid Controller and Super NES Mouse).<br /><br /><br /><span style="font-size: 85%; line-height: normal">[1] A misunderstanding that had appeared here has been corrected.</span>
