So the problem becomes one of distinguishing these posts from reports of login problems. I can set a rule &quot;if the user is anonymous or newly registered, and added lines contain at least two names of erectile dysfunction medications, do not allow the edit.&quot; Would that be a good idea?<br /><br />(Ninja'd twice)<br />Having a forum account was not intended to be a requirement under the current policy. It just happened to accidentally be one during <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/viewtopic.php?f=16&amp;t=12923" class="postlink">the 12 months when email from the wiki was broken</a>. Anonymous posts to talk pages are intended for use in reporting problems with information or with login.

This is why I locked everything but it was not very popular but I stand by my opinion. <br /><br />It may be strict but my opinion is still that Nesdev is a niche community.  The smallest requirement that people should have is to create an account on nesdev and ask for an account for the wiki. The main goal as always been to reduce the maintenance and protect the content. The chance that something revolutionary will be posted on the talk page is quite low.  The least that could be done is for small edit, there could be an email were people can post about  possible issues or some kind of feedback form where the content is never shown online. <br /><br />In all those years, how many request update as been put in the talk pages? Was it worth it? I would like to know the stats to see if I was wrong or not.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />The thing about a wiki though is that as soon as someone with the rollback privilege spots the damage, it gets reverted. I think I spend less time on spam control than I did handling new users when registration was closed. Think about it as applying the <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/11360880/2738262" class="postlink">EAFP (Easier to Ask Forgiveness than Permission) principle</a> to wiki spam. But it might be easier next time with something like <a href="https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Extension:Nuke" class="postlink">Nuke</a> though; I'll have to remember it come the next MediaWiki upgrade.
