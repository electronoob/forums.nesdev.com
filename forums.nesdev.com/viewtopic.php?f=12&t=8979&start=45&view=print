		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />So I have some results. I don't think it's yet perfect, but we're closer now than before. <br /><br />I tried a bunch of different things, so I'll try to be thorough in my explanation to avoid confusion. So sorry if this turns into a wall of text, especially because of my lack of knowledge on the matter. <br /><br />First, I wanted to experiment with the voltage coming off the Pr and Pb lines. I am again using the Pr and Pb output pins (pins 1 and 24). I made a table so it'll be easy to understand. I noticed that the voltage varies, so I just loaded and game and paused it, so the voltage would remain the same through all my tests.<br /><br /><img src="http://i59.photobucket.com/albums/g295/Ziggy587/SNES%20component/chartfix_zpseb3b2f72.jpg" alt="Image" /><br /><br />The X column means no components for Pr and Pb, just the voltage coming straight from the encoder's pins. In Y's case, X means the voltage measured at the output. The RC column means Pr and Pb pass through <a href="http://i59.photobucket.com/albums/g295/Ziggy587/PrPb-BA6591.jpg" class="postlink">this</a> circuit. RC+1k is the same circuit but with a 1k resistor to ground at the end of it. 100µF and 220µF are the capacitors I tried using in place of the RC circuit. In both cases, I had the positive leg going toward the encoder and the negative leg going toward the TV.<br /><br />Some one said that the RC circuit would be better to use than a single capacitor in the case of voltage spikes. I have no idea if that's true or not. For the rest of my testing, I used the &quot;RC&quot; circuit (with <strong>out</strong> the extra 1k resistor to ground at the end). <br /><br />Next, I tried the THS7314 amp. This is how I wired it, as per the datasheet:<br /><br /><img src="http://i59.photobucket.com/albums/g295/Ziggy587/SNES%20component/THS7314ACcpldoutput_zps3045469f.jpg" alt="Image" /><br /><br />Note A in the datasheet says, &quot;Due to the high frequency content of the video signal, it is recommended, but not required, to add a 0.1-μF or 0.01-μF capacitor in parallel with these large capators.&quot; Oh wow, they misspelled capacitors LOL. So, I added .1μF caps in parallel with the 330μF caps. The results of this were... not good. Everything was wrong looking, like a bad acid trip. I tried playing with it, first by removing the .1μF caps. Then I played with every combination of removing the output caps and resistors. I even tried it with no caps or resistors, which made Pr and Pb MUCH too bright. So, I don't know if I made a mistake some where. Instead of looking it over, I decided to try the next amp.<br /><br />Next I tried the NJM2267 amp. I built it exactly how it is <a href="http://www.gamesx.com/wiki/lib/exe/fetch.php?cache=&amp;w=640&amp;h=400&amp;media=av:n64rgb.png" class="postlink">here</a>. I tried it with and without the series 75ohm resistor. Pr and Pb are definitely too bright without it. It was looking pretty good, so I decided to take a few screen shots real quick. I wanted to be able to compare it to something close to equivalent. So, I used bSNES (latest version) as one. As the other, I used one of my SNES that's the 1chip revision. This SNES is outputting RGB into a professional grade transcoder (no upscalling or anything) then component into my TV. The TV is a 1080p LCD. I took the pictures with a DSLR. I didn't take the time to use a stand and focus perfectly so the pictures aren't super. However, it's a test of color levels, and not of sharpness or anything else. <br /><br />bSNES:<br /><img src="http://i59.photobucket.com/albums/g295/Ziggy587/SNES%20component/1_bSNES_zps53693a1d.jpg" alt="Image" /><br /><br />1chip:<br /><img src="http://i59.photobucket.com/albums/g295/Ziggy587/SNES%20component/1_PAL_zps3e2bc820.jpg" alt="Image" /><br /><br />S-ENC:<br /><img src="http://i59.photobucket.com/albums/g295/Ziggy587/SNES%20component/1_S-ENC75RPrPb_zps0e93a0dd.jpg" alt="Image" /><br /><br />What's funny is that usually the 1chip SNES is more desirable because of the sharper image (<a href="http://sd2snes.de/blog/archives/category/snes-general" class="postlink">see here</a>). But on a 1080p HDTV, perhaps the slightly blurry picture from the older SNES is more desirable. Because the 240 resolution is being blown up to 1080, perhaps the slight blur actually helps. I should have taken a picture of composite on this TV because it actually looks quite good. Bah, I don't wanna get off topic. <br /><br />For this next set of pics, the S-ENC pic is a little messed up. For some reason the water looks really weird. But if you look in the upper right corner, you can see how the path is obscured into the grass. That is close to how it looks on my TV, though not quite as bad. I think that shot was overexposed or something. But even still, the colors are fairly accurate. <br /><br />bSNES:<br /><img src="http://i59.photobucket.com/albums/g295/Ziggy587/SNES%20component/2_bSNES_zps3bdaca18.jpg" alt="Image" /><br /><br />1chip:<br /><img src="http://i59.photobucket.com/albums/g295/Ziggy587/SNES%20component/2_PAL_zpsd95102ba.jpg" alt="Image" /><br /><br />S-ENC<br /><img src="http://i59.photobucket.com/albums/g295/Ziggy587/SNES%20component/2_S-ENC75RPrPb_zps840e96eb.jpg" alt="Image" /><br /><br />So I'd have to say it's a LOT closer to where it should be. It's almost perfect now.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />So my parts arrived today and I rebuilt the amp.<br /><br />Warning incoming pics...<br /><br />Here's the old amp I used:<br /><br /><img src="http://i237.photobucket.com/albums/ff216/Sephiroth1975/General/EarlySNESYPbPrCircuitAmp_zps99c7a3aa.png" alt="Image" /><br /><br /><span style="font-size: 150%; line-height: normal">It worked out great but my some of my colors were real weak, heres capture from my startech capture device that can capture 240p component using the <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">old amp</span></strong>:</span><br /><br /><img src="http://i50.tinypic.com/iljgco.png" alt="Image" /><br /><br /><img src="http://i47.tinypic.com/f1flnn.png" alt="Image" /><br /><br /><img src="http://i47.tinypic.com/t9dzyr.png" alt="Image" /><br /><br /><span style="font-size: 150%; line-height: normal">Now using the <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">new amp</span></strong> ziggy posted (I got rid of the circuit and just used a 220uF between the encoder and the amp):</span><br /><br /><img src="http://i.imgur.com/nLlSqhz.png" alt="Image" /><br /><br />Notice the leaf's are much greener<br /><br /><img src="http://i.imgur.com/kuRk2CR.png" alt="Image" /><br /><br />The yellow is a bit lighter, but I think this is more accurate.<br /><br /><img src="http://i.imgur.com/Umy8W3k.png" alt="Image" /><br /><br />The ground says it all.<br /><br /><span style="font-size: 150%; line-height: normal">Now some emulator comparisons, I used photo shop to double the size, the colors are what's important though, not the image (<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">BSNES v088</span></strong>):</span><br /><br /><img src="http://i.imgur.com/oKX1chu.png" alt="Image" /><br /><br /><img src="http://i.imgur.com/m5jpHEY.png" alt="Image" /><br /><br /><img src="http://i.imgur.com/N2xH36T.png" alt="Image" /><br /><br />Overall I'm very pleased.  The picture looks even better on my TV than my capture.  I'm happy using this amp over the first one I tried.  Excellent picture and the colors are great.<br /><br />For those wondering the capture card used, it's this one:<br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007U5MGBE/ref=oh_details_o00_s00_i00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1">http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007U5 ...
