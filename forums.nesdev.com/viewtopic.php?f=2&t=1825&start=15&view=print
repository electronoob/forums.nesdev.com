<br />
<br />This works on Squeedo (it's how the cart's menu is operated, actually).  You just run a terminal program on PC, and the PIC buffers up to 256 bytes and gives it to the NES with IRQs.  Of course it's just ASCII-format this way, but I imagine a custom PC program could handle all the keys in a similar way.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Is there some error on the 8x10 matrix on the Family Keyboard page? Because it seems that my PoultrySoft Word program (The equivelent to Microsoft Word, just on the NES) proves it. If I type J, it puts K, if I type H, it puts J. That's not all, because if you look at the grid on the page, K is right above J, and J is right above H. It like everything on the first half (column) of the 2 dimensional grid is one line down than what it should be. Once I applied changes that took out the first half of the second row on the table, and moved everything up a line on that half, it worked just fine. I had similiar problems in my previous attempt at making this program. This is hard to explain I'm sorry, but do you know what I mean?
<br />
<br />EDIT: I think that A1-A4 on S2 on the grid should be at S0, not S2. So everything A1-A4 S3 should be S2, S4 should be S3, S5 should be S4, etc. I think that's a little more understandable than what I was saying before.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I was just saying that, because I think I have evidence that proves it to be so. I may be wrong, I know. I have my code storing the status of $4017 20 times in $20-$33 ($20 is A1-A4 S1, $21 is B1-B4 S1, $22 is A1-A4 S2, etc.). When I press F8, $20 and $32 change, not $20 and $22, which should be the case if the document is correct. I know I COULD be doing something incorrectly, but I really really do not think that is the case. Everything B1-B4 in the document is fine, but just that part I think might be incorrect.
<br />
<br />EDIT: Sorry, I had a typo. I said $20 and $34 change. It was $20 and $32. And I have it set up so $4017s status goes from $20-$33, not $20-$34.

<br />The one I have is from rom hustler, and it came with 5 different ones.

And there's a line that says "Kasetto no bakkappu suichi o OFF ni shite kudasai". Does that translate to "Please turn the backup switch OFF"? I'm not really sure what to do here, because I've never really dealt with this game, if you call it that.

<br />I discovered that when it prints that message, it's actually complaining that it can't write to SRAM at $6000-$7FFF - evidently, it has a memory protection switch on it. Family Basic is one of the few "mapper 0" games that actually <strong>needs</strong> to have PRG RAM.

<br />
<br />Edit: Yeah, that was all my fault about the shift thing. Works fine. I was checking if a certain read of $4017 was the one that meant left shift, and only left shift was pressed. Not a good plan, beings as if anything else in that read is pressed, it will act like shift isn't pressed. So yeah, that was dumb.
<br />
<br />Edit 2: What the heck! The left shift won't work in Nintendulator! help!

You should make it so it is. I think customizing it would be good. You should place a diagram where you can just customize it, but a diagram below showing which squares are which keys. In FCEUXD, they show just a diagram with key numbers on it, and I don't know which squares are which keys. I have to go search on google images for pictures of the family keyboard to see which square matches which key, and it's annoying.

<br />
<br />Yeah, the colors are very off, Tetris's background is white, and it's all pink and ugly. But I really like the new features added (Well, I really like 2 features added..) I like full screen mode. I played in FCEUXD all the time because of it's full screen mode, but now I think I'll be playing in Nintendulator!
<br />
<br />Oh, and keyboard emulation is great! Thanks!
