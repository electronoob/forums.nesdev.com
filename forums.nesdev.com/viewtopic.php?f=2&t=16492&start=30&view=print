With a little rewiring, any UNROM 128 can become an UOROM. This was one of my first hardware projects (unfortunately the pics are gone, but I still have the board somewhere, so I could grab new ones): <!-- l --><a class="postlink-local" href="http://forums.nesdev.com/viewtopic.php?f=9&amp;t=2849">viewtopic.php?f=9&amp;t=2849</a><!-- l --><br /><br />So yeah, there's absolutely nothing hard or obscure about battery-backed CHR-RAM or UOROM, as these are some of the simplest mods one can do to donor cartridges, even simpler than the mandatory ROM replacement. If someone has the skill to swap ROMs, they can add a battery or connect the extra address line of UOROM just fine.<br /><br />But if you're so hung up on using &quot;popular&quot; configurations from back in the day, that's fine. I'm just trying to debunk the myth that some of the less common configurations make the production of carts harder or more expensive. In fact, the games you often mention as examples of battery-backed MMC1 games are crazy expensive, and would never be used as donors, so I don't know how easy it is to come by a reasonable MMC1 donor, so modifying an UNROM might actually be easier/cheaper. IDK.

So, after we set a foot in the market with &quot;City Trouble&quot;, I ported my own, never-released arcade game to the NES.)<br /><br />If I ever created an NES game based on &quot;Django Unchained&quot;, I would be free to use modern mappers since the game would also be modern inside that fictitious history.

I've always come with that philosophy, make games as they were made back then, and I do not aim to push the system to its limit or invent new things. Whether this is feasible in hardware easily or not is a totally orthogonal question.<br /><br />That's why I find it even weirder you don't insist more on passwords. Games with battery back up were really a small minority of games back then. I suspect that actually WRAM was not really more expensive as of 1988 or so, but batteries sill were expensive, and that up until the end of the console's life. The fact many games had to use CHR-RAM means Nintendo had to buy 8k SRAM chips in mass quantity anyway, so if games also used for PRG-RAM it doesn't make such a difference, just a minor cost increase. That's why it's common to see games that said &quot;screw it&quot; and added a 8k SRAM chip in the cartridge, probably it was only a minor cost addition to the cartridge, however only games that needed really complex saving system used battery backup.<br /><br />That explains why CHR-RAM battery backup wasn't done; In theory it sounds nice, it's just a battery added to a normal game cartridge and does not require any extra chips (just extra discrete parts). But the problem is not the cost of the extra 8k SRAM chip, nor the extra PCB area, but the problem is indeed the cost of the battery which is very significant and cannot be reduced.<br /><br />I suspect EEPROM saving was even more expensive, considering it was only used in a couple of games in Japan made by Bandai.<br /><br />In addition to that, Passwords has the advantages you can write them down on a sheet and re-use them as many times as you'd like, unlike battery saves which are gone as soon as you overwrite them with another battery save. Even if you dedicate the whole 8k chip to saves you could have more save slots, but there's still a limited amount of them. Also loosing saves is a real problems. I've lost my saves regularly no matter whether I pressed RESET or not. When I did a whole playthrough of Final Fantasy 3 on real hardware, I usually saved to <em>all</em> 3 of the save slots to ensure at least one of them would remain on the next booting session. It was not rare than the first or the second save slot were randomly erased, only the 3rd one seemed more stable.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">Or could they have converted it to a password system, but they just said &quot;Eh, screw it&quot;?</div><br />To be honest, for me it's still a mystery to me why Zelda used battery saves when Metroid and Kid Icarus, using the same game engine, didn't. My wild guess is that selling Zelda more expensive was more acceptable because it came with a gold package (except some later revisions) and came with a walkthrough included.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">Does &quot;The Legend of Zelda&quot; or &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; use that enable/disable feature anywhere?</div><br />I can't comment on &quot;The Legend of Zelda&quot; (you should look it up using FCEUX), but I can guarantee you Final Fantasy does not use the WRAM disable bits, at least not directly. The CHR-banking regs are just written to with &quot;00000&quot; at startup, which enable SRAM. It's possible that it's disabled at power-on if the MMC1 internally initialize to &quot;11111&quot;. All PRG bankswitching is done with the top bit at &quot;0&quot;, which means again that SRAM is enabled (and again, it is likely that the MMC1 defaults to &quot;1&quot; effectively disabling SRAM at power-on).<br /><br />Actually I'd be very interested to know if/which games ever used those bits other than setting them to &quot;0&quot; at start-up and never chanting them ever again.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">I don't know how you define crazy expensive, but &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; can be bought for $20-$40 on eBay.</div><br />Both &quot;The Legend of Zelda&quot; and &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; are well known because of their franchise. I'd expect SNROM games which aren't part of a well known franchise to be significantly cheaper (and also, in some cases, less shameful to destroy).<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">Using CHR space for things other than tiles isn't so rare though. SMB and a bunch of CNROM games have data stored where tiles would normally be, so I guess developers weren't opposed to sacrificing a few tiles.</div><br />But this is with CHR-ROM, which is a completely different thing than CHR-RAM.

I've heard <em>Ultima: Exodus</em> in particular mentioned as a relatively common yet forgettable SNROM donor.<br /><br />A few of these (<em>Khan</em>, <em>Nobunaga</em>, and <em>Three Kingdoms</em>) are SOROM, which differ from SNROM primarily in having two WRAMs, only one of which is connected to the battery. SOROM can protect save RAM from stray writes even if you're using WRAM as work RAM: load the extra fixed bank code into WRAM 0, which isn't battery-backed, and the save data into WRAM 2, which is.

I could be wrong but don't think anyone here would even know the genre existed at all. Secret of Mana was the first JRPG-like game to be released here with a great success, but it's an A-RPG. Final Fantasy Adventure was released here before that, but I think it was largely unsuccessful (the translation is awful, too).<br />Final Fantasy franchise was unheard off here before 1997 and the release of Final Fantasy VII for the PS1 (ok, Final Fantasy Mystic Quest was released, but I think it sold very poorly and that nobody noticed it).<br /><br />Rare was the only large NES game developer based in Europe. There was however also the company that made Asterix (based in spain) and the guys that made Elite, I think they were from France ? Also there is Software Creations, I think from the UK but only did a single NES game (Solstice), but at least it's a great game.

(Even &quot;City Trouble&quot; was programmed with NTSC in mind.) So, of course, we know about &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; and &quot;Dragon Warrior&quot;. However, we only have a rudimentary knowledge of Japan-only Famicom games. That's why Katrin is aware of the battery saves in the JRPG games, but not that the Japanese version of &quot;Dragon Quest&quot; uses passwords. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=":wink:" title="Wink" /><br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">Bregalad wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">Final Fantasy Adventure was released here before that, but I think it was largely unsuccessful (the translation is awful, too).</div><br />Whether successful or not, this game is the one that inspired us to do a story-driven game in the first place.<br />This time this is even true in the real world because I couldn't find an NES game with a real on-going story. Also, I even played this game in the 90s, so yeah, in reality and in our fictitious history, I knew of the game. (I even had &quot;Final Fantasy - Mystic Quest&quot;.)<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">Bregalad wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">Rare was the only large NES game developer based in Europe.
