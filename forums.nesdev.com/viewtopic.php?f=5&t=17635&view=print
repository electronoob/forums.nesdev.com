Not quite sure if the priority &quot;masking&quot; works the same way.<br /><br />Audio has 4 channels, 12-bit freq, 4-bit volume, 1-bit duty, each can be square/triangle/saw/noise. <em>(edit: corrected typo and omission)</em><br /><br />Not sure if per-scanline raster effects are possible, but there seems to be a 4-way split screen mechanism? It refers to them as &quot;quadrants&quot;, not exactly sure how this works but it seemed like you can divide the screen in half twice and have a separate scroll position for each quarter?<br /><br />Couldn't seem to find a spec for the CPU speed? Does it just run as many cycles as it needs until it tells you to display a frame?

It's a very useful masking effect sometimes, but something that's not really intuitive behaviour.

What do you suggest I do to make it stand out more?</div><br />Maybe if it was more like the pseudo-consoles where modern retro-inspired games (e.g. Shovel Knight) run, it would make more sense for this day and age.<br /><br />Modern displays are all widescreen, so it'd better to make proper use of the screen space. More background layers adds a ton of possibilities for effects and large objects. That combined with a window layer greatly reduces the need for raster effects. No need to be so stingy on the number of palettes either. In fact, doing away with the convoluted attribute system, which is one of the most hated aspects of the NES, would be a great idea. Using 2 bytes per tilemap entry would open up a lot of possibilities, like per-tile palette selection, more than 256 tiles for the background, tile flipping and more priority control, kinda like on the Master System or GBC, so still well within the realm of 8-bit consoles.<br /><br />I would worry about improving the sprite system a bit too. The OAM could definitely be larger, also improving versatility. A few more bits per entry would really help in allowing access to more than 256 tiles, more palettes, and smooth scrolling at the top and left edges of the screen.<br /><br />This would do away with most of the restrictions the NES has that annoy new artists and programmers, but still keep the feel of a real retro console, with period-accurate language and I/O systems.<br /><br />Lots of palettes and a generous number of sprites could even satisfy those going for a look closer to that of 16-bit consoles, since it'd be possible to stack sprites and design backgrounds with less color repetition. A master palette better than the Master System's 6-bit RGB would really help too (maybe go with <a href="https://www.bigmessowires.com/2008/07/04/video-palette-setup/" class="postlink">RRGGBBII or RRGGBBSS</a> if you want to keep it 8-bit).
