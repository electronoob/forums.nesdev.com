Why the hell do you need 256KB of PRG-ROM for such a simple game? No graphics, no music, no options... did you just stuck a whole uncompressed dictionary in there?

I may later on add support for standard controller as well, possibly add some more graphics, background musics, etc (if it fits in the last 16K PRG bank), or anyone else can modify it too if you want to since it is public domain.<br /><br />I would like other people to help to add more words/phrases so if you have any suggestion, please post it.

But practically, to choose one at random, you're going to need a random seed with at least 13 bits of <a href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entropy_(computing)" class="postlink">entropy</a>. You can't get much of a seed from key press timing; each press yields only about four quality bits. (The upper bits are predictable and therefore don't count as entropy.) I think that's why Rare's version requires the players to enter their names on an on-screen keyboard before the puzzle appears on Vanna's board.

I don't know how good quality it is but it seems to work OK as far as I can tell.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I guess you can check the controller state about 30 times in a frame. It's actually rather difficult to press any button for less than one frame, so you'd have a fair bit of variety on just a &quot;press start&quot; timing on the title screen (especially since most people won't be trying to press it quickly anyway).<br /><br />It might be a problem with emulators, though. Input polling might be abstracted and run on its own timer.<br /><br />As for debounce, is that a problem with the NES? I've never tried polling the NES controller more than once per frame.
