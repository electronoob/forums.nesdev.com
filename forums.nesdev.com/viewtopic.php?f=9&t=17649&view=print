		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />A user on Kaydus's nesdev Discord server mentioned wanting to be able to keep track of game stats from a game being played on an actual NES, for speedrunning purposes (automatic splits) and to keep track of things like death count. This made me think of modifications I've seen that replace the NES's RAM with dual-ported RAM, but I feel like a Game Genie-like device that watches for writes to specific RAM addresses would be a lot better because that would avoid modifying the NES, and it would work with PRG-RAM too.<br /><br />I guess the obvious changes from dual ported RAM + microcontroller are that you'd need to find a 72-pin cartridge connector somewhere (and I hear they're difficult to find) and you'd probably need some sort of programmable logic to be able to react to the write fast enough.<br /><br />Another option I can see would be the Everdrive N8's USB port, with a custom mapper that watches for writes in addition to performing mapper functions, if the hardware is capable of controlling the USB port like that.<br /><br />Any advice or better ways to accomplish this? Or preferably a preexisting product?

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I have been thinking about the exact same thing sometimes when watching speedrunners doing their splits manually. I think you could do a lot of stuff by simply watching PRG accesses, just have to configure it for each game separately. So a GameGenie-like device should be sufficient. You could test this theory on emulators quite easily, e.g., with Lua support in FCEUX.<br /><br />I think many speedrunners wouldn't go for a EDN8/PowerPak solution since they seem to prefer to do attempts on original cartridges. But it would make for a cool demo.<br /><br />The device could keep track of frame count based on M2. Or even cycle count, if you have enough bits in your counter. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />Another idea would be to use the expansion port, but unfortunately it doesn't have the necessary signals. It has the data bus, but only A15 of the address bus. So you'd need a GameGenie-like device to pass more information via the EXP pins, but that kind of defeats the point of using the expansion port.

It's all based on trust.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />While it does sound interesting, being able to read RAM on console, coming from a speedrunner perspective this would be a big no no. Looking at the RAM during a run is not allowed as it can provide an unfair advantage, like knowing what RNG seed you are on, enemy/boss patterns etc. Anything that you can't do on an original, unmodified console is not allowed. It could prove useful for practice however, but would need to be turned off for actual run attempts.

I think in general as long as they're open about it, in most cases it's still considered an acceptable run?

I t wouldn't just be some unknown thing some guy is using.<br />It's very easy to cheat in speedrunning if you really want to, and it happens a lot as it is. But there also exists a sense of trust, a code of honor as such (which is what caused the community to point out the blatant lies going on at Twin Galaxies), and it's usually very easy to out a cheater.
