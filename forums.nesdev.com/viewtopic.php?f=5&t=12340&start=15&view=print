Most of them have lava/slime or some other kind of trap to kill you, though...I wouldn't be surprised if there's one where you're just -stuck-, though. I swore I found one in Heretic, but I may have been cheating...or just plain clueless.<br /><br />Actually, I forgot we were talking about the SNES port. I don't know too much about that one specifically, I only played it long enough to say &quot;neat&quot;.
