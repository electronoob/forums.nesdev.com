		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I'm sitting here messing around with things in nametables (still trying to figure them out!), and now, everytime I go to assemble my code, my tiles get compacted.... the first tile is pushed over and overlaps over the second, and the third and fourth are overlapped.  I'm willing to bet everything else is overlapped too, but it's just blank space (i.e. all black).  Also, the first tile is replaced by a tile with just a single dot.  I'm not sure why this is happening.  My code is pretty much ripped right from NESprgmn.txt.  Not much different.  Any ideas?

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Alright, well, I've managed to figure some things out... I made a new .chr to start that from scratch.  Didn't have that overlapping problem again, so I don't know what that was.  
<br />
<br />I know this isn't the best way to draw tiles to the screen to make background (not this coding anyway), but I drew some tiles to the background to just make a small figure.  What I can't figure out is why it doesn't display at all correctly in Nintendulator?  It's fine in some emus, and in others it isn't.  I built this with Nesasm, and I've included everything in this zip file if anyone wants to take a look and give me a clue as to why it's so different in Nintendulator.

It falls apart at the end of the program, but I'm not too worried about that right now.  I'm gonna look that thread about level designing over a bit better now to get an idea of how to make some better code.
<br />
<br />About the assembler issue... what would you recommend using, and how would I apply the header to the program?

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Lots of people use CA65 and I use WLA-DX, there is also some others assemblers out there. The big problem is to understand how they works, because they all does differently, but once that problem is passed you wont have problems anymore, but NESASM is simple to learn, but however very limited and lack of features.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Finally got that basic test working.  It now runs stable in Nintendulator, which is what I wanted to happen before I moved on trying to learn other stuff I suppose.  It no longer flys apart now, so I'm happy with my first venture, even if it is lame <img src="./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" />

<br />
<br />I looked at my code and noticed I was loading Y (what I was using as a kind of counter) with $00, and comparing with $xx ... I needed to load with #$00, and go off of that... no clue what I was thinking.  
<br />
<br />I downloaded WLA-DX and honestly, right now it feels a bit overwhelming.  There's alot more features to it that I really don't need as of yet, and it's almost scary!  I know just enough assembly right now to do some basic stuff... which I'm comfortable with at this point.  I think for now I'll stick with NESASM, if not for the simplicity.  It feels like it's a great way to learn for me for now.  I'll be keeping WLA-DX on my computer for a later time though, it seems like it's really powerful!  Thanks for the advice Bregalad, I'll put it to use in the future.
<br />
<br />I finally understand what Absolute Indexed Addressing is... funny how a paragraph in a .txt file can explain it better than a book!  I couldn't understand how the palette got loaded, but a tut doc I found cleared it up.  Pretty easy really, and very basic.  I'll be looking for ways to incorporate that in various methods of coding now.  
<br />
<br />I guess this is just kind of an update on how I'm coming along.  It's slow going, but I'm testing out as much stuff as I can to avoid flooding you guys with tons of questions.  The main thing I'm having problems understanding right now is Vblank and the whole PPU thing, but I guess something will eventually pop in my mind while reading something, it usually does... most of the time <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Yeah, when I first downloaded WLA-DX, I was like, WAY overwhelmed. A little bit ago, I made a hello world demo with WLA-DX, and I was really proud of it. But if you start working on bigger projects like me, you need something other than NESASM. NESASM is not very Large-Project-Friendly. It's okay for when you do small projects. WLA-DX is good, because it feels way more free, while being way more free. I don't know, it's hard to explain.
