Bizhawk actually has a timer throttle that uses a similar basic implementation; QueryPerformanceCounter() with Sleep() for long waits and Yield() for short waits.  (I never looked at it until I read these articles, heh.)  The CPU usage is quite high compared to D3D9 VSync throttle, and the particular implementation makes no attempt to synchronize anything to VBlank, but otherwise does well enough.<br /><br />But perhaps I'm letting the original problem get away from me here... When does D3DPRESENT_INTERVAL_ONE not work right?  And if the answer is &quot;when crappy drivers!&quot;, then is there anything that can be guaranteed to work in such a situation?   If all you have is GDI+, you can't guarantee any sort of timing because your paint commits have another dozen layers of sludge to go through before they get to hardware.

With DWM enabled (assuming Vista/7/8), that's the only behavior you'll get in windowed mode.  In other words, you can generate 1000 frames per vsync interval, but DWM is only going to output the last completed frame.<br /><br />* Mostly yes, at least.  You're not guaranteed that the update will happen following the next vsync, as DWM can miss/skip frames (if, for example, dwm.exe scheduling is delayed).

Anyone know how allegro manages it?<br /><br />Edit: Just had another thought. Basically Sleep() isn't accurate enough, only the CPU is, so what if we did the following;<br /><br />1. Use any function DDraw/Allegro/Whatever to wait for a vblank.<br />2. Start a timer that runs alongside the CPU. Let's say that the CPU has 1000000 cycles per frame.<br />3. When the timer hits 1000000 cycles Blt and reset the timer.<br /><br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">while (1)<br />{<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;Timer = 0;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;Blt();<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;ProcessFrame();<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;Sleep(1) &lt;-- Sleep where possible until another Sleep(1) would make Timer go above 1000000<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;// lets say that for example 99000/1000000 cycles have now passed<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;temp = 0;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;while (temp &lt; 1000)<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;temp++; // lets just say we know that this will kill the other 1000 off<br />}<br /></div><br /><br />This of course assumes that the CPU and the GPU run at precisely the same frame.

It's probably just using the builtin D3D Present() mechanism for vsync.  For OGL?  Possibly one of the swapinterval extensions, or just hoping that the drivers enable OGL vsync by default.

Other programs will need to run, so even without the sleep() your application will lose time slices randomly. It will also drive up CPU/power usage entirely unnecessarily. There is a function called WaitForVerticalBlank which is designed for exactly this that should be used instead, if you really do want to wait for the hardware vblank. However, Present() is designed to wait for vsync and put the image on the screen with a timing the OS thinks is appropriate, which is more robust than trying to wait on vblank yourself. At your program's level there is no reliable way to vsync a windowed app; if it can be done, it is the OS's job.

If I maximize the window to 1920x1200, I get tearing about 32px off the bottom of the screen, but it's consistently in the same spot, not the usual psuedo-random tearing position you would expect. In full-screen mode, there is no tearing.<br /><br />Fun Fact II Turbo: A few quickie things I've made in Multimedia Fusion 2 with hardware acceleration enabled, whilst maximized but NOT in fullscreen mode do not tear whatsoever. How this was achieved I do not know, but it is interesting to observe.

However, nowadays (as stated several times before) Direct3D has the Present() API which definitely knows about double buffering, and could potentially do this for the user. It probably can do this for the user in the right situations, but it doesn't in all situations.<br /><br />The bottom line, I think, is that outside of Fullscreen mode, the ability to vsync is not directly under the program's control. The user's display drivers and the specifics of how they're configured are what really determines whether or not a double buffered Present() will act in a way that prevents tearing. You can try to hack a &quot;windowed vsync&quot; solution in software that seems to work on your system, but ultimately it's not going to work everywhere.<br /><br />Also, newer APIs from Microsoft, like WPF, tend to just use D3D/Present() under the hood. It really is the way they expect you to do double buffering.<br /><br />(Edit: sorry if I'm a broken record here.)

When I upgraded to 7, I left Aero turned on, and all of the emulators I use just automatically stopped tearing without me needing to do anything.
