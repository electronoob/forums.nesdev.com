The biggest thing it does that <a href="http://nesdev.com/bbs/viewtopic.php?p=88746#88746" class="postlink">my own engine</a> doesn't is the mirroring switch, which MMC1 can do but #34 (oversize BNROM) can't. On #nesdev, we got to discussing how I could port Action 53 to MMC1. Testing such a port would need emulator support because there aren't any existing MMC1 boards over 512 KiB, nor does the PowerPak support such an oversized PRG ROM. And in any case, we'd first need to define an extension to the MMC1 to handle PRG ROM larger than 512 KiB for emulator and PCB makers to implement. Because of how existing PRG ROM select bits are arranged in existing MMC1 cartridge boards, this is tougher than the "obvious" oversize extensions to many of the discrete mappers.
<br />
<br />SNROM, SOROM, SUROM, and SXROM reuse unused bits of the CHR bank address as follows:
<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">43210&nbsp; PRG ROM and RAM bank &#40;$A000&#41;<br />PSSxC<br />||| |<br />||| +- Select half of a bank &#40;ignored in 8 KiB CHR mode&#41;<br />|++--- SOROM: Select PRG RAM chip at $6000 &#40;0: scratchpad; 2: save&#41;<br />|&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; SXROM: Select save RAM bank at $6000 &#40;0-3&#41;<br />+----- SNROM: Disable PRG RAM &#40;0: enable; 1: open bus&#41;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;SUROM, SXROM: Select 256 KiB PRG ROM bank &#40;PRG A18&#41;<br /></div><br />How should PRG ROM bigger than 512 KiB work? Would the bank bits be added in reverse order like in <a href="http://wiki.nesdev.com/w/index.php/INES_Mapper_087" class="postlink">mapper 87</a>? That would look like this:<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">43210&nbsp; PRG ROM and RAM bank &#40;$A000&#41;<br />PRGxC<br />||| |<br />||| +- Select half of a bank &#40;ignored in 8 KiB CHR mode&#41;<br />||+--- Select 1 MiB PRG ROM bank &#40;PRG A20&#41;<br />|+---- Select 512 KiB PRG ROM bank &#40;PRG A19&#41;<br />+----- Select 256 KiB PRG ROM bank &#40;PRG A18&#41;<br /></div>

<br />
<br />Is there any reason to leave both CHR banks enabled and not tie the mapper's A12 input low, freeing up all 5 bits for other purposes? i.e. has anyone had reason to switch both 4kB slices of CHR RAM to the same half?
<br />
<br />As far as I can tell, there isn't really a reason not to do both. Is there any reason to support banked PRG RAM? Otherwise I'd just allocate all 5 bits in normal ascending order, even it it implies support for things much bigger than iNES1 can support.

<br />
<br />Your proposal seems logical to me.  I'm more than willing to help out with hardware testing if/when you get to the point that it becomes useful.
<br />
<br />My thoughts:  I'd question if sticking with the MMC1 is really worth it since the mapper isn't already supported wired up as is.  Seems like it'd be simpler to just add mirroring select and such with your BNROM setup as we're discussed before.  The only real benefit of MMC1 is that it has relatively low pin-count and the IC exists in donor boards.  However the pin-count is a non issue really for discrete/cpld solutions so really you're only supporting the destruction of original carts.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />That's actually a very good point, infiniteneslives. Once you have to add emulator support, even if it's defining a new variant, you may as well define something that's a better match (e.g. cheaper)... for example, a variant of AxROM which used the top 4 bits as the input to a 74'153 and allowed you to choose any mirroring format. (Or only use two bits of the latch and wire it differently to provide 1ScA/1ScB/H/V only, in which case it could be backwards compatible)

<br />
<br />Tell me when you can get a NES game case, mapper, PCB with 8KB CHR-RAM and 8KB WRAM for less than $3. That will never happen. And nobody will take the leap and produce boards with MMC3-quality mappers for use for cheap, so the only way to get a really good mapper is to use donors.

<br />
<br />Not sure what you consider cheap but I'm actually in the process of creating MMC3 capable boards.
<br />
<br />
<br />While it is significantly cheaper to use donors, it's significantly less time consuming to produce sizable quantities of games using new parts.  I could assemble 5-10 boards in the time it would take to hack up rewire and troubleshoot ONE donor.  So really your argument is only valid for small production quantities or making a game for yourself alone.  If you consider the cost of time they become cost competitive quickly.  The only way they'd be significant cheaper is if you or someone else was willing to offer up the labor to convert donors for free.
<br />
<br />That and you'll never convince the large population of the community that doesn't support hacking donors in large quantities.  I'm pretty sure many more action53 carts will sell if they use all new parts compared to if they used donors even if they cost $10 more.  You can complain that the market needs to "get over the fact of using donors" but that's alone isn't going to change anything.  So until then your argument is moot when considering production quantities larger than a dozen or so...

<br />So that I can quantify the cost of time, how long does it take to rewire one SGROM or SNROM game for PRG flash, including running three CHR address lines out to the PRG, and test it?
<br />
<br />But there are other advantages of using all new PCBs. First, I imagine a ROM completely soldered to the mainboard would be more structurally sound than one that has had a whole bunch of pins lifted. Second, one can put in a CIClone, which lets one cart service NTSC NES, PAL A, and PAL B.
<br />
<br />A mapper based on #34 with D7-D6 repurposed for MMC1-style mirroring control (1/V/H) would take about three chips: a 74HC377 (8-bit flip-flop), a 74HC153 (4 to 1 multiplexer), and a 74HC20 or 74HC04 to invert R/W into /OE to avoid bus conflicts. Someone on IRC recently gave me a rule of thumb that once a mapper has four discrete chips in it, that's when one should start using a CPLD.

<br />
<br />That said, it seems to be almost trivial cost: Digikey sells 1-gate variants of the 74'00, 74'02, 74'08, 74'14, and 74'32 for 63¢-70¢/10 (and $36-$38/1000).

When switching from the last bank (which contains the menu) to another bank, it reads the bank number from the game list and writes it back to the same location. But when switching from another bank (such as one holding a compressed screenshot) back to the last bank, it has to linearly search for a $FF byte starting at the reset vector. (Both reset patches include a $FF byte.) Eventually I plan to add support for individual games that surpass 32K, and I'll have to specify an ABI for how to make a table that the ROM builder can patch properly. A game using multiple mirroring settings, for example, would need a copy of the table for each mirroring setting.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">Digikey sells 1-gate variants of the 74'00, 74'02, 74'08, 74'14, and 74'32 for 63¢-70¢/10 (and $36-$38/1000).</div>
