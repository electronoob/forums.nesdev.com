The whole reason why I did this is because the nes powerpak never recreates the audio of these carts exactly like the real thing.  I don't mind discouraging people from doing this gremlins 2 is a pretty fun game and it's not like this is some easy 5 minute job.  I've had people get mad at me in the past because I refused to post instructions on how to do certain mods since I don't want to see people frying expensive and hard to find hardware.  I looked at the option of wiring up the AY chip I even bought a couple of those chips.  The AY audio circuit is different I want to make something that sounds 100% like the original cart.  Does anyone know if the AY audio output is different from the 5b chip based on how this audio circuit I found is wired?

I think they were successful, either the AY or YM will make the right sounds. The harder thing to duplicate is the mixing.<br /><br />I think the PowerPak does a decent job of emulating Gimmick's hardware. It doesn't have the envelope or noise of the 5B, but the game doesn't use those. Really I think it's not that hard to get 3 square waves replicated fairly well... I would guess it doesn't really handle the logarithmic volume curve fully, but the game itself generally keeps the squares in the quiet range of the chip anyway, so it's not much of a problem for Gimmick.

That's why I started making these conversions.  If we can get the AY / YM / powerpak to reproduce the audio 100% the same that would be awesome!

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Well, one of the things that's weird about Gimmick's mix is how loud it is. It's much louder than any other expansion cart I've tried. I guess this is due to the internal amplifier?<br /><br />The APU mix and output level differs from Famicom to Famicom, but it has an average and an expected deviation like anything else. I don't think it has anything to do with revisions, mostly just different resistors that are still within the range of tolerance. Different Gimmick carts would have slightly different mixes as well, but there's still a sweet spot somewhere that we might call &quot;correct&quot;. There's a huge difference between the range of tolerance between carts/Famicoms and the mix you'll get from the PowerPak w/audio mod, for instance. (Though as I said, I think the PowerPak is doing a fine job for Gimmick.)<br /><br />The 5B is a YM2149F, not an AY. The difference is that YM envelopes can be twice the resolution, and it halves the incoming clock to accomplish this. However, this is not relevant to Gimmick, since it doesn't use the envelope.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I was looking at the Japanese schematic and apparently the sound is generated MONO at pin 27, mixed with the Famicom sound through a 10K resistor and then amplified by an OP AMP which is inside of the mapper chip at pins 2 and 3 ...  Fun stuff, no ?<br /><br />Edit: AY has louder outputs, which allows for wiring the chip straight to the Famicom feedback without an amp chip.<br />Edit2: Wiki has that fixed already. Outdated me. <br /><br />Now to fit an YM2149 on it and properly amp the audio !
