<br />If you pay attention you'll see that I also wrote "spread" as in "freely distribute". The fact that I can't do something I want to be able to doesn't mean I will when I can, I just like to have options. And using copyrighted characters is just frowned upon too much these days. If I can come up with the physics, I might still settle for a Sonic clone, but not the blue dude himself, if not, I'll just use the whole engine for a different type of game with more traditional physics (still fast though).

<br />I've definitely seen a few clones of Mario with Mario as a character available for free and I don't think they are illegal, as long as they're free. Altough some phyics weren't faithfull to the true Mario games and that is annoying.

<br />Unfortunately the actual copyright laws say otherwise.  Making money is not a requirement for copyright infringement.  Not likely to be prosecuted for it on a small NES game but some people still care about the legal parts.

<br />Then there is hundred of thousands of YouTube parodies and Flash games on the net who are copiright infligrements.
<br />
<br />If you place a 10 lines long tiny pathetic text to say thing like "Sonic (TM) is a recorded trademark of Sega (R) and blah blah blah" like we see everywhere but never read it, it may become legal.

<br />Saying it belongs to someone else doesn't give you the rights to use it.  That notice lets you use Sega's trademark when referring to them, like "This game compatible with the Genesis (TM Sega)" or use their logo, not to use their copyrighted materials as your own.

<br />The difference is that Sega is more likely to tolerate the former than the latter. Because there isn't much of a market for character art prints in North America, they don't compete with Sega's products, unlike games.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />In discussions like this, it's good to keep the issue of <em>what</em> is legal separate from what is likely to cause <em>actual</em> legal trouble. Some people like to understand the law clearly, even though they may decide to disregard some parts of it. They reason that to do the latter and know the consequences, they must know the former. Also, for many individual reasons, people differ on what parts should be followed. Like opinions, simply stating one's position along the lines of "I don't think this legal situation will happen, so I suggest you not worry about it" is much less useful than "I don't think this will legal situation will happen because of the following facts: ..."

<br />Is legality based on how much the company cares about your fan work?

<br />
<br />All 3 of my games had music in them in some spot or another.  Siamond doesn't during gameplay cause you kinda want to be paying attention to the pattern tones and not have music distractions.  Geminim had it on the title screen and a few other places, but not during gameplay.  That was a restriction of the Famitracker engine.  Pillars certainly has music during play though.

Since thinking whether or not something is reasonable is an opinion, not fact, it causes lots of problems, and everyone has different opinions about this, and can't ever be clear on what's "in fact" reasonable and what's not according to the law.

<br />
<br />clamp are having a heavy money making industry, also they reuse their characters a lot - it's pretty much clear they want to milk their cash cow as long as possible and "free stuff" of any kind would be just hurting their concept.
<br />
<br />as long as there is fan art only, i think it's fine - but some companies even have a problem with this...
<br />
<br />everyone should avoid copyrighted material in homebrew anyway. people like to rip sprites, artwork, music and other stuff without asking. my definition of "homebrew" was "beeing different" - but others might not see it that way.
