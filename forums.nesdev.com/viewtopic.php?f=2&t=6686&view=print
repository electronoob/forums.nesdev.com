<br />There's Xorcyst, By the same author. The NES assembler and tool suite that recently went open source, But you may need a way to build from source as there is no binaries for it!
<br />
<br />Actually, Except for the older copies archived on a old website by him, in which the site is kind of dead. But the wisest one to do is to build from the current, updated sources. Try looking for them on google.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Thanks a lot, Hamtaro. However there is a problem. None of the files on that site will download past about 200KB and thus I get a corrupted file. There has been a couple sites that I've ran into like that even though it's really rare. Not sure why that happens. 
<br />
<br />If you or someone could host those files somewhere so I can download them at a different place, I'd greatly appreciate it.

Here is the results from <a href="http://gilgalad.arc-nova.org/junk/projects/DonkeyKong_asm.zip" class="postlink">Donkey Kong</a>. I even did a compare from the original ROM and there was no difference.

<br />
<br />I understand your point. However, I didn't want to spend hours picking the game apart when right now I'm just making sure that the base product works and you know that you can modify it with a little bit of effort.
<br />
<br />The entire process was to compile and modify NESrev to disassemble games. Find a assembler that works with the output and that goal has been reached so far with NESrev. Now I'm going to try and mess with 32K games once I have time.
<br />
<br />Maybe later I'll take one game and make it more readable and with a better chance of modifying. With the 16K games, that should be a snap since you can easily expand to 32K.
