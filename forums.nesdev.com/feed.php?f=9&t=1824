OK, I have used this cart before, and this is the deal. If you use 27C256 chips you have to fill the entire chip with data. Yup, the entire thing. Use a hex editor and multiply the file size until you get 256 KB. I had to do this too, I know it kinda sucks and it takes a lot of time until you get used to your hex editor. Kinda makes you wonder if the chip is overkill... just kidding. I use a freeware hex editor called Cygnus for PC and it works pretty good for stripping off headers, splitting files, and multiplying file sizes to fit the chips. Actually, I did have an interesting idea the other day. I am going to multiply my NROM games to 128 KB and then put two of them on the cartridge. I then will take the most significant byte of the EPROM chips and wire up a switch to pull it high or low, and I can have two banks for two games, 128 KB each. ('cuz 128 +128 = 256) When I want to change games I can pull out the cart and turn the switch to the other position, and viola! Another game! If I like it and it works I may even take the second most significant bit and make four banks of 64 KB each and then I could have 4 NROM games! <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" /><p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=450">arfink</a> — Sat Jul 29, 2006 11:14 am</p><hr />

Hi all. I'm kinda new to this whole thing so please excuse my ignorance. I have a hack of SMB that I would like to burn on a cartridge. I'm having a hard time getting it onto a cart though. I purchased an EPROM burner and some 27C256 ROMS:<br /><br /><a href="http://jameco.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/ProductDisplay?langId=-1&amp;storeId=10001&amp;catalogId=10001&amp;productId=225947" class="postlink">THE BURNER: Flash Writer/Programmer With USB Interface</a><br /><br /><a href="http://jameco.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/ProductDisplay?langId=-1&amp;storeId=10001&amp;catalogId=10001&amp;productId=39714&amp;pa=39714PS" class="postlink">THE ROMS: 27C256</a><br /><br />I went down to the local game exchange shop and got some Mapper 0 carts NES NROM256-02 (i think it was golf or baseball) and an NES NROM128-01 cart. I took off the CHR and PRG chips, put in a socket (i bought this socket: <a href="http://jameco.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/ProductDisplay?langId=-1&amp;storeId=10001&amp;catalogId=10001&amp;productId=526256" class="postlink">SOCKET</a>) and I burned some of the 27C256 roms, put them into the socket and now i'm getting a gray screen. So really i'm going back and i'm trying to figure out where I went wrong - I think it is the way i've burned the 27C256 ROMS. My questions are:<br /><br />1) The CHR and PRG files are much less than 32k (27C256 rom). I was reading that the CHR and PRG file may need to be burned multiple times on the ROM so they equal 32k (ie CHR 8k x 4 = 32k). If this is the case, what would be the best way to accomplish this. I'm on a MacBook (Tiger 10.4) but could do this in windows if it's easier.<br /><br />2) Can I put SMB hack onto an NROM128 cart? <br /><br />Also, are there any other recommendations or from the steps above does it look like i'm doing something wrong.<br /><br />BTW - I really started getting into this because of an artist that taught a class on new media art at my college. If anyone hasn't heard of him, definitely check out his site - he is doing some great work:<br /><br /><a href="http://beigerecords.com/cory" class="postlink">Cory Arcangel</a><p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=784">kirkm</a> — Thu Jul 20, 2006 6:37 pm</p><hr />
