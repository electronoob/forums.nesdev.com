You probably won't notice it if you aren't as familiar with the game - it isn't obvious, but there's a clear effect of &quot;for some reason I just don't play as well as I should&quot;.

Mario itself has a full frame of delay before jumping - depending on the timing of the button press, it can be up to almost 2 full frames, so 32ms. Then you have to keep in mind the camera is 30fps, which can easily add another 15+ms of delay. So you can already trim off 30-45ms, which leaves you with ~60ms of lag more than what you might have gotten on a CRT TV in 1985.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">DRW wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">So, yeah, try out the fullscreen version with an emulator where you know it's Direct3D and see how it adds three additional frames of lag.</div>Yup, using exclusive fullscreen + vsync adds another 2 frames of delay on the video (so 3-4 real frames).

In exclusive fullscreen, the tearing is very easy to notice with vsync off, and disappears with vsync on.  I can only assume Windows is doing some sort of voodoo magic to prevent screen tearing in windowed mode.

I have probably done it on the cement factory stage in the red Wii version though, don't remember exactly.<br /><br /><br />I remember I had tearing with my old computer in many emulators but on my newest I don't see any in Mesen even in full-screen mode and vsync off. No noticeable input lag either.<br /><br />BTW I don't really get the point of vsync. It's to avoid tearing which happens because unfinished frames are displayed. Isn't that why you use a constant framerate? With a constant framerate the game is consistent on all systems that are up to spec, while with vsync all computers run it at different rates and it isn't consistent at all.

Vsync just means that the game display will only update the image during vertical blank.<br />So, if your monitor runs at 75 hz, the game will still run at 60 fps and without tearing, but the scrolling will stutter since sometimes frames are updated twice and sometimes they're only updated once.<br /><br />(In MAME you can actually choose whether the speed should adjust to the monitor frame rate or whether you still want to keep the original speed even if you force the game to update only during vertical blank although the monitor has another hertz value.)

In this mode there's no way for the application to control whether or not vsync applies. As always with Windows, if the application is not in true exclusive fullscreen mode any use of a vsync API is a placebo. (This includes the popular &quot;borderless window that covers the whole screen&quot; alternative to true fullscreen.)<br /><br />If you've ever seen &quot;do you want to change the color scheme to improve performance&quot; pop up, that fallback mode lacks a global vsync, and you can see tearing there, if you like.<br /><br />As for whether Direct3D adds 3 frames of lag, I mean, it's quite possible that it does on DRW's system right now, but it doesn't <em>have</em> to and it's not designed to (I've measured very good latency with it in the past), but there's a bunch of links in the chain between application and display (keyboard &gt; keyboard drivers &gt; windows &gt; application &gt; windows &gt; GPU drivers &gt; GPU &gt; monitor) and <em>any</em> of these could be configured in a way that adds unnecessary lag. Most of these aren't directly under the control of the application at all.<br /><br />If the situation on your system is that true fullscreen performs more poorly than Aero's globally vsynced windows compositing, something is sadly out of order. The whole point of fullscreen is to allow the application direct and low latency control of the screen. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" alt=":(" title="Sad" /> Most likely I'd suspect the GPU driver here, but like I said there's a lot of links in this chain.<br /><br />We have had a discussion very close to this a few times before, here's one I remember:<br /><a href="https://forums.nesdev.com/viewtopic.php?f=5&amp;t=14743" class="postlink">https://forums.nesdev.com/viewtopic.php?f=5&amp;t=14743</a> &quot;Please explain to a layman: input lag&quot;

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Yeah, dialing the conversation back a bit, I was exclusively talking about lag introduced in one emulator compared to another.<br /><br />I never did anything to measure each emulator's amount of lag, and I have no idea how much lag is implicit in my system, which is a cheap work laptop. But what I <em>can</em> tell is that no matter what video settings I've tried, I haven't been able to play games in FCEUX without enough lag that it influences my performance, and quick experiments with a bunch of other emulators showed similar results until I tried Nestopia which actually surprised me by being the best out of the the ones I tried, and playing Ninja Gaiden felt completely like playing it on a real console/CRT setup (even though in reality there's probably at least one extra frame of lag, if only due to the LCD display).<br />As such, it's hard for me to recommend playing this DK port in anything else. I don't know what emulator Wes Copeland (the current world record holder in Donkey Kong) is playing here, but he's constantly complaining about the input lag. At least he's well aware that it's caused by the emulator:<br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://go.twitch.tv/videos/188731450?t=2h38m">https://go.twitch.tv/videos/188731450?t=2h38m</a><!-- m --><br /><br />When you're playing Donkey Kong on this level, one extra frame of input lag does make a difference.

I've <em>never</em> said that.<br /><br />What I said was Direct3D as an interface is capable of low-latency behaviour. On this, <em>you</em> don't seem to believe <em>me</em>. D3D is <em>designed</em> to be able to do this, and it very much can, and yes I've measured it on many occasions past and present.<br /><br />If you're talking specifically about MAME's particular Direct3D code, that's very different than talking about Direct3D overall. I have measured many programs, but never specifically MAME. Tried a quick measurement of MAME right now, and yes for me it does have a few extra frames of latency when &quot;video = ddraw&quot; vs &quot;video = d3d&quot;. This is not the same as Direct3D vs DirectDraw though. Clearly MAME is also doing a lot of stuff in D3D mode that it isn't in DDRAW, and there are like 30 more options that are specific to D3D in the ini file. I'm not about to dive into MAME's source code, or try a billion permutations of ini settings in order to have an argument about what MAME is doing wrong with its Direct3D implementation, though.<br /><br /><br />Anyhow, sorry, I didn't want to increase the off topic discussion here. Obviously you can't do better than a CRT + hardware that's directly synched with it. I just wanted to respond to the statment that D3D adds &quot;3 frames of lag&quot;, which is just not true as a statement by itself. It does seem to be true that MAME's D3D mode adds 3 frames of lag. I'd gladly agree to that.

I just noticed that the same issue happens in MAME and in Nestopia and they're both based on Direct3D while I never saw anything like that in fceux (DirectDraw) or the DirectDraw mode of MAME. So, I assumed it's Direct3D itself.<br /><br />But ultimately, I don't really care. I have my NES, my Super Nintendo and a CRT TV. Input lags of emulators don't concern me anymore.
