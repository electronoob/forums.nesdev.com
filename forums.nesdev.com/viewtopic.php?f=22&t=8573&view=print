		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Hi all
<br />
<br />A couple of weeks ago I started reading up on making NES games. I don't know why, but I grew up with NES and I stumbled upon the PowerPak online and thought "I need to try this". I have previously done flash games and other small projects. I have never done much assembly, so when I found Shiru's guide on NES programming in C I was very excited. I had previously read the Nerdy Nights tutorial, and in combination there is all the info that one needs to make a small game really quickly.
<br />
<br />I would like to share my first try at NES programming. I did all the graphics and music in NES Screen Tool and FamiTracker. The game was programmed mostly in C using Shiru's library, plus a little bit of assembly (to get the parallax scrolling to work).
<br />
<br />It's a very simple game. It goes on until you die, and then you are presented with your score. Basic NROM 128. (Of which most is unused <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />) The sound effects are a little buggy (don't know why), but they do the job. Controls are left and right only. You lose life if you step on the red platforms, regain it by stepping on blue ones. Don't get crushed by the ceiling, and don't fall off the bottom.
<br />
<br />Please try it out. Maybe it will fit on the "Action 53" <img src="./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" />
<br />
<br />Thanx to nesdev and nintendoage for all the great threads I've read! And a special thanks to Shiru, whose font I stole and for his great C library!
<br />
<br />Link here:

<br />
<br />PS. Can I enter the 2012 compo whit this?

<br />As far as I know, anyone can enter with any(playable) game\program for NES.Besides, Your game is much better than my last compo entry, so they have to let you in <img src="./images/smilies/icon_twisted.gif" alt=":twisted:" title="Twisted Evil" />

<br />
<br />But come A53 release, I'd like to have the source code for this so that I can combine it with other minigames in the same 32 KiB PRG bank. (They can use separate CHR banks of a CNROM if needed.) The biggest bottleneck is number of PRG ROM banks.
<br />
<br />Denine: If it becomes nearly as easy to make an NES game as it was to make a GBA game, and people become aware of this, expect more NES games.
<br />
<br />
<br />EDIT: This one also needs <a href="http://nesdev.com/bbs/viewtopic.php?p=89407#89407" class="postlink">803C:F0</a> to work in a multicart.

<br />
<br />My first couple times through I thought I might have some criticisms, but as I played a few more times I got an appreciation for how you set everything up.
<br />
<br />I will say though that the parallax effect is pretty cool, but it kinda messed with my vision a bit after playing for 10 mins or so.  My computer screen keep seeming like it was scrolling down even though it wasn't for about a minute. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />  Its possible this would have happened even without the parallax effect, but I'm not sure.
<br />
<br />Looks like a great early entry to the compo IMO.  And since you were able to whip it out so quickly looks like you've got time for more entries!

<br />
<br />I'm glad that my code and article were useful.

<br />
<br />I did notice a little bug. If you walk off a platform and immediately steer back toward it, you will land on it again. If you do it repeatedly, you can refill your life on a single blue platform (although I died a couple of times trying to do it).
<br />
<br />Still, fun little game, and pretty good for your first game. I feel a little more encouraged about the idea of trying to make my own homebrew game some day.

<br />Great little game this - would love to see an improved version with perhaps a selection of different backgrounds and improved graphics (titlescreen in particular).
<br />
<br />Might even get a cart of this made for my famicom <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />
