The fact that people here actually tried it out and made videos to disprove me. As if there was actually a chance that I found a hidden feature in a famous 24 year old game that no-one else ever found out before.</div>
<br />
<br />And what of the person who took the time to edit a screen shot of Metroid to make Samus Aran nude?  I wouldn't call that funny, I'd call that disappointing.
<br />
<br />That said: I smirked at what you originally posted here, and I've had a chuckle at some of your previous postings as well.  I'm almost always in jest myself, online and in person.  "Old regulars" from IRC #nesdev can tell you how absolutely bonkers I can be.  My point here is: yes, I can take a joke, and I do find crude humour funny.
<br />
<br />The reason I made the video is because 1) you've a recurring theme when posting on this forum (seemingly trying to make people take the piss spouting off lies and general nonsense) and 2) some folks were starting to take your nonsense seriously.  There's a 3rd and 4th reason I suppose: I'd never heard of the Metroid Password Generator before + it'd been a while since I'd played Metroid.
<br />
<br />My point is: you don't have to be serious to hang out here, and your edited screen shot was funny (to me), but when someone calls your bluff don't act like an ass.  :-)
<br />
<br />And please don't start some preposterous debate (re: nudity vs. porn).  What some consider nudity others consider pornography, regardless of the Wikipedia or dictionary definition.  Ever heard the phrase "beauty is in the eye of the beholder?"  It applies here.  To me your screen shot edit isn't porn -- but some could be offended by it nonetheless.  Should you live your life by other people's rules?  No, but have a little bit of taste next time.  :-)

<br />It's not the same color as the hair. It's the same color as the shoes.

<br />Oh, that's no problem. If you really didn't take me seriously anymore, I would simply create a third persona. Then we'd be Joh, Njo and Hn instead of John and John.

As long as the good John keeps posting interesting things related to NES development and the nudity-fan John keeps it subtle, I won't see much of a problem. The thing about Mega Man platforms was cute for an occasional laugh, but a page-lengthening post consisting of hundreds of repetitions of "Penus " wasn't. Nor was devoting an entire post to scrambling the letters in a quote to say "intercourse", but had it been about a racing game with an "outer course" and an "inner course", that might have drawn a chuckle. If Mr. Hyde wants to post about his PINGAS, there are always other forums for that; try the comments of <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bDQQg0qMWgs" class="postlink">any random YouTube Poop video</a>.
