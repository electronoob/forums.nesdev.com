<br />Update:
<br />
<br />I have four more complete boards+cable sets, and then I will be out of cables, and I will sell the boards only for a discount.  If you want a board without the cable, that's fine (the IDC cable is included,  I just won't be shipping any more of the DB-25 cables).

Something like the CopyNES combined with the PowerPak, all in the form factor of a Game Genie shaped device that didn't require modification of your NES or Famicom <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />

Using the replacement ones on eBay is not good enough, they are already expensive and would need an expensive case to get everything lined up.  The electronics for a dumper are relatively easy but CopyNES adds so much more than that.
