If you could consistently get everything in the NES to the same starting state each time your program ran, testing would be very simple: run it once, and if it works, it has no bugs (up until it reads the controller or battery RAM, that is).<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">anzihoio wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"><br />'m just trying to write the best reset routine possible (and never touch this code again )<br /></div><br />I'd treat EVERYTHING in this thread as unreliable. If I had some time and wanted to do what you describe, I'd first get available all the NES types for testing: NTSC frontloader, toploader, PAL frontloader (toploader?), and the various Famicom versions. Then write code that verifies that $2000 is not clear by reset on some of the machines. Then write code that clears $2000 just after reset, and see whether I can get an NMI to occur just before that (what's that, like a 1 in 5000 chance?). Either way, verify that removing the $2000 clear allows an NMI after reset on those machines, but not on ones like the NTSC frontloader. At this point there would be confirmation that the clear is needed for consistent behavior.<br /><br />Basically, I wouldn't trust a one-code-fits-all-NES-units reset routine until it was tested well. Even if everything posted here is correct, we might be missing some detail or not thought it through. The standard one works fine, where you wait two frames before doing PPU writes.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=17">blargg</a> — Tue Oct 26, 2010 1:17 pm</p><hr />

So in summary :<br />- After a PPU reset (power on, frontloader NES reset), $2000 and $2001 writes are ignored for 2 frames, but NMI and rendering is disabled by the reset anyway.<br />- After a CPU reset (toploader NES or FC reset), the PPU remains in it's old state, but $2000 and $2001 wrties works immediately.<br /><br />In other words, to be "safe" that your program will work identically on all models of NESes and FCs, disable NMI and rendering, wait 2 frames, and then do whatever else you have to do.<br /><br />I guess Final Fantasy would have a very low probability to crash when reseted on a FC.... If you hit the reset button at a time that the game is not in it's iddle loop, and that you are able to release the reset button a few cycles before a NMI triggers, the game will crash.

Reset clears $2000 on the front-loader NES, so you don't have to worry about a write just after reset being ignored, unless you're enabling it. If the PPU isn't connected to reset, then presumably writes work immediately after reset, and thus you're able to disable NMI.<br /><br />But, I don't see how that helps. Let's say that NMI is enabled when your reset handler begins. This means that NMI could occur immediately after the first instruction, even if you disabled it there with something like LSR $2000.

There is also the case to consider for hitting the reset button, because at that point the screen and NMI probably are both turned on.  Same deal with doing SEI as the first instruction, IRQs are disabled on power-on but that doesn't mean they weren't turned on before reset (worst case a program could have a bug and accidentally execute a CLI instruction).<br /><br />Also, I know the toploading NES (and Famicom?) does not actually reset the PPU with the reset button (there is a reset pin on the chip), so it'd be wise to reset the PPU registers even it works OK on the 'usual' NES.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=10">Memblers</a> — Sun Oct 24, 2010 3:12 pm</p><hr />

Yeah, it may "not work", as in the writes will not go through, but you'll also see on that same page that rendering and NMI's will be by default disabled when system is powered on / reset, so it doesn't matter.<br /><br />It''s just good practice to clear them. Some revisions / clone systems might work differently.<br /><br />BTW, I could test the power-up/reset state of PAL NES, but I doubt there will be any significant differences.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=80">thefox</a> — Sun Oct 24, 2010 2:31 pm</p><hr />

I guess the "safest" way to go is to disable NMI and screens, wait 2 frames with $2002 polls, and then disable them again.<br /><br />I'm pretty sure Final Fantasy would crash if an NMI would occur in the first 2 frames though.
