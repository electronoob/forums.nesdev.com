		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Not to mention also people had a staff dedicated to a project. And each person worked on a specific part, knowing exactly what they had to do. We have to come up with all the concepts behind a game, program it, <em>and</em> create all the data ourselves. Coming up with the concepts behind a game (for example, how maps are to be stored, how AI works, the math behind game logic, etc.) might prove to be the hardest part. Once you know what to program, it's not as hard. Though programming is usually tedious.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Programming is not as tedois as doing graphics IMO. And I'm supposed to be part of a team, but I admit I do 95% of the work currently. Altough I'm very happy when my friend gives me ideas, I don't always have good ideas for game (altough I can come with programming skills and do some music), but he always have incredibly fun and original ideas I would never have. Because he knowns absolutely nothing about computers this is even more funny how he can make up stuff. If I don't want to do it because the idea is just too crazy I just say it's technically impossible, and he's forced to belive me because he knowns nothing technical.

They work on the gameplay until it's perfected. [...] Like I said, people gravely underestimate how much work went into the DESIGN of those games. Adjusting the game mechanics until they play perfectly.</div><br />It's very similar with Apple, whose products distinguish themselves in the subtle refinements of their designs. Other companies make mp3 players that look similar, but subtle elements are left out. For a sidescroller, perhaps the single biggest thing that affects the feel of the game is the physics of the jump. Even within Nintendo games, a Mario jump is very different from a Samus jump (especially Super Metroid), where Mario is much more constrained by momentum.</div>
<br />
<br />That's exactly what I mean.
<br />
<br />I am always fascinated when I pop in Super Mario Bros, because although the graphics are highly outdated, the carefully tweaked game mechanism still manages to hook you up immediately. What I mean with game mechanism is how Mario responds to the controls, and how it interacts with the environment. What also works really great in enhancing playability are the sound effects, which are VERY closely timed to match the action. The result is a tight stream of action and feedback between the player and the game, which really is one of the most imortant aspects why SMB still today plays so well. 
<br />
<br />This is one of those timeless aspects which I am talking about. Of course there are many other aspects wich can be discussed here, but the point is to stress the fact that great games on the NES and other consoles rely SOLELY on their game mechanics, and not the amount of rastersplits or CHR banks you can swap in.
<br />
<br />Of course we can only develop NES games in our free time. That's probably one more reason to cut down your game idea to its bare bones, and see how well it still plays. But on the other hand, we have no deadlines to fulfil. We can take as much time as we want to spend into developing our projects.

Moving a huge boss around the screen in a platformer needs either a raster split (later Mega Man games) or so little floor detail that horizontal lines with sprites over them are enough (Contra).<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">That's probably one more reason to cut down your game idea to its bare bones, and see how well it still plays.</div><br />By "cutting down to bare bones", does that include cutting down the state that persists between power cycles to no more than 64 bits, the comfortable maximum for a 16-character password? Some game genres usually have much more state than that.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">But on the other hand, we have no deadlines to fulfil.

<br />Not necessarily. Some people like to finish one project before starting another. (For me it's finish a music engine, then finish a game that uses it, then start another game.) So the deadline is "before one gets sick of the project".
