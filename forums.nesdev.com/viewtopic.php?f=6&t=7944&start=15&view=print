The ridiculously simple truth behind common practice era harmony is that composers/musicians back then were really fascinated with the sound of thirds and their inversions (so major and minor thirds, major and minor sixths, tenths, etc.). They felt they sounded "sweetest" of all the intervals. Use of dissonances and parallels are treated with care to bring out the sweetness of thirds (and as a consequence, the fullness of triads) as much as possible.  That, for me, is the root cause of all those rules. I am not sure I understand why that isn't mentioned in music theory books, because once you realize it it becomes quite clear. </div>
<br />
<br />No! Just play what feels right and matches what is on-screen! Not many people will mention this, but that is how you should approach it. In your music engine, play music that fits the mood of the game. I don't care if _you_ think it's boring when you listen back.... it's probably the right thing to play! Just write what seems right for the game, otherwise, the game loses stability.
<br />
<br />Get some advice from a couple of friends to confirm it if you need to. Just go with the gut instinct you have of what the music should play.
