That way the screen won't flash grey for the first frame or two. I know that all NES's had pre-set values and some say that different colours would flash up, so I think that for neutrality reasons and for best results having a totally black palette on ROM load would be best. I don't believe that any game relies on the palette entries to run, but does anyone else?

<br />
<br />That seems backwards to me. You're proposing to use palette values that can be detected by code running on the emulator. My proposed solution (and tepples') have no effect on accuracy as code cannot detect it, short of asking the player whether the screen flashed a color at power-up.
<br />
<br />My idea is to keep a boolean flag for palette entry 0 (or one for each entry, if you want to be thorough) that is clear at power-up and set the first time a write to that entry occurs. Then in your "PPU rendering off" code you use black in place of palette entry 0 if this flag is false.
<br />
<br />As to the likelihood of a game relying on power-up palette values, that can be replaced with certainty by either scanning all NES ROMs, or writing a ROM that specifically reads palette entry 0 at power-up and crashes if it's set to black (assuming that no actual NES powers up with that value). :)
<br />
<br />Update: I wrote a tool and had it scan about 3400 ROMs for reads from a palette entry before it was written (stopping after one minute if none occurred). Only Bandai Golf read from a palette entry before writing to it, but it ignored the value. So, if you're emulating NES <em>games</em>, it probably doesn't matter (but I don't have every ROM so I can't be sure). If you're emulating NES <em>hardware</em>, the values at power-up matter.
<br />
<br />In case the power-up palette test ROM I released is relevant here, that merely checks whether the palette matches that of my NES, which would obviously fail on NES units which have different power-up values. I personally don't think that all the test ROMs I've released (and am going to release) are worth making an emulator pass unless <em>the</em> prime goal is accurate hardware emulation.

It's likely that during those PPU revisions where power-on filled the RAM with unique values (like the wave RAM on classic Game Boy units), at least some units had $xF. Specifically, $3F has all bits set, which is a common initial value for memory cells.
<br />
<br />And it's true that some inaccuracies (such as &gt;8 sprites on a line) are useful to implement for user experience's sake, but there should be at least one accuracy-Ã¼ber-alles emulator for each host platform on which NES software development takes place. Currently all there is is Nintendulator for Wintendo.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Well, my NES blinks with a color nearly black, but not exactly black, but it's a dark grey, definitely darker than $00 is. I think it should be color $2d or $1d maybe.
<br />The reason because each NES turn on with a different value is simple, just take two NAND gates and mont them in /R/S flip-flop (the exits of each gate goes on the entry of the other gate, respectively, and the second entry is the /R or /S signal), and watch what is at the exit of one of the two gates. Be sure to tie both /R and /S high, and turn the power up. You can't say if your exit will be on high or low states, because both are rignt. But you can turn the power on and off as many times as you want, you'll most probably always get the same state on power up. By changing the componants making your flip-flop (the gates), this power up state may change, but it'll be usually the same for the same componants.
<br />Because RAM chpis containing data for palettes are nothing else than a huge amount of flip-flops, all bits can be neither one or zero at power up.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Not really. Consider a NAND gate, that just turn on when the power went up.
<br />One of the inputs is tied high, so don't care with it. The other input is tied to the output of the parealel gate making a flip-flop effect. You can't know if this signal will be considered to be high or low, because just before both gate didn't work because the alimentation voltage wasn't high enough, so the output can't really be used as a know state. Now, this unknow number is ANDED with 1, so there is no change, and then inverted. Once this is done, this output will go trough the other NAND gate, and be inverted on it's output. So this loop continues as long as both /R and /S inputs are high, making memory state. In practice, it will be more often 1 than 0 on power up for an unknow reason, but it can be 0 as well.

<br />That means that my flip-flopy theory doesn't apply to the NES' palette at all, because it wouldn't be made with those. But the principle is the same, unknown value at power up, but additionally unknown value if it isn't read for a while. If you don't use particular color on the screen (for example you have no sprites using another palette than palette 0), may the unused colors become inacurate ?

If you leave the palette alone the screen will flash grey for a frame or two, which I think is best corrected by my first idea of filling the palette with 0x0F on a ROM load. I know that some of you may not agree with that idea, but I think that it is the best solution. Some of you may cry 'but that is not accurate!', but since there is no single solution I think that my way best.

<br />YOU did notice that effect because yours is blue, but I didn't notice something really funy myself, having a dark grayed console.
<br />
<br />To be the most accurate, the best option would be to make the player choise it's own initial colour, while this would be totally useless and wasty on the other hand. Most emulators have $00 as the default palette. I think that ANY walue is accurate, scince every NES has a different color.
