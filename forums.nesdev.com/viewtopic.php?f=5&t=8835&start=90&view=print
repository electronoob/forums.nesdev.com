Screw the haters and freeloaders, the people who actually matter are grateful that you've ran things this long (and are offering to redirect at all, you could just say "tough shit, I'm going down on X date with no redirects, it's my hosting and I'll do what I want"). That's a sign of character, that you're even willing to extend it as long as you are.

<br />
<br />HTTP redirections are extremely low-bandwidth and incredibly simple to maintain, so I'm actually going to be extending those until December 2012.  (I'll be updating the Parodius home page momentarily to reflect that)
<br />
<br />Email redirections are also simple to maintain, but can be high bandwidth depending on what someone sends (e.g. Emailing an ISO image would take up twice the amount of my bandwidth -- once to receive it, and once more to forward it on to another host), and are susceptible to my own DNSBL/RBL rules that I choose to use.
<br />
<br />The box being used for redirections is <strong>my own personal box</strong>, which means the SMTP server running on there is configured <strong>to my and ONLY MY liking</strong>.  The DNSBL/RBLs I use there are significantly more strict than the ones I use on Parodius presently, simply because the only person using the box <strong>is me</strong> (and that's how I want to keep it).
<br />
<br />A historic problem I've dealt with for 5-6 years now (at least), with regards to a hosting service (e.g. multi-user systems), is juggling anti-spam tactics.  A solution might solve problems for one user, but induces problems for another.  This has happened 40 or 50 times -- no exaggeration -- and there is very little one can do about it while keeping the KISS principle in mind.  There are ways to solve it, but it involves a lot of resources (basically a single SMTP server/daemon for each user, thus they can control their own DNSBL/RBLs, as well as an instance of SpamAssassin per user) and is extremely annoying/complex to maintain.  So like I said earlier, providing Email services is something I regret ever doing, because it's just a complete and total nightmare.  Plus there are lots of free services (like Gmail) who do a much better job <strong>and</strong> give you a decent amount of control over your spam rules.  Though I personally wouldn't trust storing all of my Email on Google or Microsoft (Hotmail)'s servers, they're still both good services for POP/IMAP where you download your messages periodically and delete them from the server.
<br />
<br />Both of these things -- HTTP redirections and Email redirections -- still cause me to have to provide some degree of support, which is another part I'd really rather not be doing.  If you ask me "So then why are you?", the answer is: because I'm a nice guy, and I really hate it when I see companies/providers/etc. simply shut down and leave everyone in the dust w/out a care in the world.  Again, morally that just isn't how I operate.
<br />
<br />Sorry, rambling a bit there, but maybe that gives more insight to some things.
