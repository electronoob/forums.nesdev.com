As someone who's been collecting NES for a couple of decades now, it's one of the most retarded thing I have ever seen, and it just came out of nowhere with no justification. But hey, if people want to pay premium for a botched up version of a game, it's their funeral.

You should look it up before talking. Soldering a wire or cutting a track is trivial. Picking a microcontroller, programming it, be sure that the frequency is OK, and the pinout too, etc... is far from trivial.</div>Well the CIC behaviour is widely known. Actually programming a microcontroller may not be so trivial if you haven't done it before. But then again there are pre-made CIC clones you can buy and the previously mentioned adapters that comes with region free CIC clones, so I think it's a relatively trivial matter.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">Sumez wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"><div class="quotetitle">Bregalad wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">As far as I know, only the extremely rare Nintendo World Championship cart relies on the CIC.</div><br />Haha, okay.

I can't remember wether they got the diactrics right but I'm almost certain they didn't - most likely they didn't care and dropped them altogether. As for german I think they didn't even bother to translate it so german players had to play the game in english even if that means understanding nothing at all - which in a game like this basically removes any possible enjoyment.

I struggle to understand when people speak it, but usually I'll get into the groove if I hang around Swedish people for some hours. Norwegian is much harder, I'll always have trouble understanding that despite its written form being almost identical to Danish.<br /><br />But Swedish have a lot of words that are absolutely nothing like their Danish counterparts, or in some cases just mean completely different things (&quot;roligt&quot;, &quot;skratta&quot;, &quot;glass&quot;... and let's not forget the time I misunderstood a girl when she said she needed to pee). I laughed out loud in Shadowgate when I came across this huge snake, and the game described it as an &quot;orm&quot; (worm) <img src="./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" /><br />I picked the Swedish version because I was just a kid and didn't understand English at all, so it seemed like the logical choice. But there were a lot of these strange words that just had me stumped, and my parents had no idea either. I was stuck for months at the phantom that you need to burn with the magical torch. I mistakenly believed that the clue to beating it was in figuring out what the hell it even was, as I had absolutely no idea what &quot;Skuggvålnad&quot; meant. If the game had been English I would probably have had an easier time, especially as I was already beginning to learn the language from other games.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Heh interesting, I'd think Norweigan was closer to Danish than Swedish is. Orm has meant snake since a long time ago (like in Midgårdsorm from Norse mythology), but I think rolig used to mean calm instead of funny as in modern Swedish (orolig still means &quot;uncalm&quot; interestingly enough).<br /><br /><br />I read an interview with the guy translating the game to Swedish (same guy that translated all the manuals for NES games at the time). He translated the script and sent it to Japan. Then when they got a translated sample of the game they noticed that the diacritics was missing and immediately called Japan, but it had already started being mass-produced. I guess the Japanese people didn't think the diacritics was a required part of the letters or something. It was fixed in a later revision though.<br /><br />I think Shadowgate and Dejavu were the only NES games translated to Swedish that I know of. All other games remained in English. Not that we had a lot of RPGs and Adventure games in Europe anyway.

On an emulator with large pixels then yes indeed it's noticeable.<br />Also I bet the font is 8x8, then it's almost impossible to have a A letter with a mini-circle upon it, as it would require 3 extra pixel rows for the circle - wheras an umlaut only requires one extra pixel row (possible 2 as a blank line is required between it and the letter). Having just 5 pixels for the letter itself is not enough to draw a normal, readable font. The only solution here would have been to draw the circle on another tile, just like they usually do it with kana in japanese games. If however the game was japanese-developped and originally supported the dakutens, there is absolutely zero excuse not to have handled the diacritics correctly, which is basically the same thing.<br /><br />EDIT : I am fairly sure there is no Swedish verison without diactrics - or at least not in the game. Maybe that was the manual or other material. All ROMs on Bootgod's database are SWE-3S-0 PRG, and the -0 indicates this is the earliest (and in this case, only) mass-producted version. If a version without diactrics exists, it had to be a prototype, and as such not mass-produced.<br /><br />Also, there seem to be a warning about some words being misspelt : <a href="http://bootgod.dyndns.org:7777/image.php?ImageID=5002" class="postlink">http://bootgod.dyndns.org:7777/image.php?ImageID=5002</a><br />I see the box is in english, which is.... wtf ?! It would have been way easier to translate the box than the ROM, having a translated ROM boxed in english makes zero sense. For instance, the german version has a box in german although I'm fairly sure the ROM is untranslated and left in english (I might be wrong - if the ROM indeed is in german then it's undumped).

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Yeah, using a solid dot is pretty common (even outside tile graphics, we do it in script all the time) and is perfectly legible. Diacritics on the other hand will mess up the reading. Even on a crt where the difference may be somewhat smudged when using a circle, that difference is still enough to decode it as separate letters on the go. It'll just look a bit cramped.<br /><br />I'd even prefer if they had used aa for å instead of ä. while aa isn't used much except in surnames and old place names, it's still decodable as å. It seems this spelling is also somewhat more prevalent in denmark. <br /><br /><br />If i were to do anything using å and ä (or â á à) on a 8x8 tile grid today, i'd definitely put them on separate tiles. Looks cleaner.
