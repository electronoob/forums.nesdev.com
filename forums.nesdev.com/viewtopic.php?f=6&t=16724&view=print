		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I'd like to put the music and sound effects for FamiTone into different banks because one bank will probably not be enough for my new soundtrack and I don't want to mirror the sound effects in every music bank.<br /><br />Since I don't know much about music drivers, I need to ask:<br /><br />Is it a mundane issue to switch the bank in the FamiToneUpdate function because processing music and processing sound effects are clearly separated?<br />Or would this be more complicated because variables that point to music and sound are used in a mix?<br /><br />For example, at the start of the FamiToneUpdate function there's this piece of code:<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">&nbsp; &nbsp;lda FT_SONG_SPEED&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;;speed 0 means that no music is playing currently<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;bmi @pause&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;;bit 7 set is the pause flag<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;bne @update<br />@pause:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;jmp @update_sound<br /><br />@update:</div><br />So, would it be enough to switch to the sound bank right before the actual <tt style="margin-left: 2px; margin-right: 2px; padding:3px; background-color: #3355aa; color: white;">@update_sound:</tt> label? (The music bank is of course already set before the function gets called.)<br />Or wouldn't this work because variables that point into the music ROM are still referred after <tt style="margin-left: 2px; margin-right: 2px; padding:3px; background-color: #3355aa; color: white;">@update_sound:</tt>?

But in this case, it's a mundane issue: Before I call a music or sound function, I simply set the corresponding bank.<br /><br />But in FamiToneUpdate, music and sound are mixed, so I have to insert a macro call into &quot;famitone2.s&quot; itself. And here, one needs to know the internal workings of the code to do it right.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">dougeff wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">Look on the bright side. If (when) it crashes, you will know you forgot to put in the right bank. That will help you figure it out.</div><br />Forgetting is not an issue. I have wrapper functions for that stuff, so I simply need to call my own PlayMusic or PlaySound function for the regular stuff and it will take care of setting the correct bank.<br /><br />The issue is whether this one code piece that needs to go <em>into</em> one of the FamiTone functions, namely FamiToneUpdate, is correct and works according to FamiTone's inner implementation. (I.e. switching the bank to sound if a later code part still reads music data from ROM would be a bug introduced by me.)

That's the case in the moment where everything is still unfinished.<br />Here, I simply switch to the sound bank before a FamiTone function that reads from ROM is called.<br /><br />But in the end, it will probably be like this:<br /><br />The sound effects will fit into 16 KB.<br /><br />The music may or may not fit into 16 KB.<br />But it doesn't really matter whether we have one or more music banks. As soon as music and sound together don't fit into the same bank, my issue about the bank switch remains.<br /><br /><br />And I'm not willing to fiddle with the feature where you can decide on the fly which one is the fixed and which one is the variable bank, putting sound effects and the FamiTone library into the same bank.<br /><br />My MMC1 game has an UNROM-like bank setup with the $C000 bank being the fixed one and $8000 the variable one.<br />I will not juggle with the banks by loading FamiTone and the sounds into $8000, then making $C000 the variable bank to load the music there, only to make $C000 the fixed bank again to get back to the main code afterwards.<br /><br />I won't alter the global bank logic of my program to satisfy the needs of one specific aspect of the program if altering the global bank logic literally isn't needed anywhere else and if satisfying those needs can also be done by simply inserting a bank switch somewhere inside FamiToneUpdate.
