		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Thanks a ton, Myask. That's exactly the kind of proofreading I need. I'll implement all of those changes.<br /><br />As for etymology, it's Korean (and errs toward the side of sino-Korean, or Korean with Chinese origins, especially in regards to color). I try implement it into my work whenever I can, and I'm also a big fan of enemy names using foreign languages to generate fantasy naming conventions (apparently <a href="https://www.famitsu.com/game/extra/special/2000/zelda/zelda04.html" class="postlink">Koopa originates from gukbap</a>, a Korean broth served with rice, I could only speculate from the similarity between the bowl and the shell.) But plenty of enemy and item nameswere simply not localized, just transliterated in game manuals, and I really dig that.<br /><br />Anyway, the word origins are as follows:<br />(Standard romanization given when different. For example, the eo in Korean romanization is intended to be pronounced like the short o in dog. Also, I freely chose between older and newer romanization in regards to consonants (such as j and ch or g and k)<br /><br />Nalgae (날개) - Wing<br />Gopjil (껍질, ggeopjil) - Shell<br />Bam (밤) - Chestnut (frequently used as a color reference for a particular shade of brown)<br />Ja (자) - Purple (most commonly used to refer to the slightly reddish purple a specific breed of sweet potatoes have)<br />Chung (청, cheong) - Blue<br />Hong (홍) - Red<br />Bollé (벌레, beolle) - Bug, (but frequently used interchangeably for beetle, such as a stag beetle being a saseum beolle, or deer bug)<br />Komori (거머리, geomeori) - Leech<br /><br />The last is my absolute favorite, and no one ever asked from <a href="http://www.mteegfx.com/post/142300585324/the-cowlitz-gamers-adventure-manual" class="postlink">last year's manual</a>, so I haven't shared it yet:<br /><br />Swiss Army knives in Korean are literally called <a href="https://www.google.co.kr/search?q=%EB%A7%A5%EA%B0%80%EC%9D%B4%EB%B2%84%EC%B9%BC&amp;newwindow=1&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjVqpriiLbTAhXGlZQKHY-YDUYQ_AUICigB&amp;biw=1236&amp;bih=580" class="postlink">McGuyver knives</a> (맥가이버칼 or maekgaibeo kal). <br /><br />So, the name for the spinning blades, Maekgaibo, comes from (맥가이버, maekgaibeo), what I believe to be the raddest instance of Korean appropriation of English.<br /><br />However, in development, we just refer to them as blue slugs, yellow blades, etc. though. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />Anyway, will update the image when I get a chance to do so. Thanks again for taking a look at it.<br /><br />EDIT: Forgot bul sot (불) - fire, (솥) - pot (cauldron, etc.). Specifically chosen in reference to large ceramic pots used for cooking.

I'm an immigrant with long and deep roots in the culture who also does my research when needs be. I choose to incorporate Korean culture and linguistics into my work because it is a deep part of who I am and so that one day, my children may see it and feel a connection to it. Would rather not soapbox, though.  Enjoy the art. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />@Myask: Yeah, Korean has a number of loanwords and phrases from English that are used differently, commonly an adjective may be used in place of a noun, or syllables will be broken up, dropped, and reused. For example, sandwich is frequently just sand. So, you can see things marketed as  Cheese Sand. I'm pretty sure it's common in all languages (English's introduction of other languages' words being no exception) but it doesn't make it any less amusing. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br />Also, I apparently have never once spelled MacGyver correctly.<br /><br />@Tepples<br />I read the source link for the Maori controversy, and it's an interesting read. I certainly didn't mean to imply that appropriate research and consideration shouldn't be made, (though I could see due to my phrasing that it could have been read that way).
