It's also old and somewhat outdated, but not nearly as much as the parallel port, and desktop stations of nowadays still have one on them (even if laptops doesn't have any).

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Barrier to entry with a parallel port: pretty minimal. Two connectors. Barrier to entry with a serial port: about the same, but now you have to emulate a UART in the FC, which slows things down by a factor of ten and keeps the FC busy from doing anything else. Using an &quot;ordinary&quot; serial port doesn't actually help, because if you're using it as bit-bangable I/O it's incompatible with USB, and if you send asynchronous serial you still need voltage limiters to keep from frying the FC. You could use a &quot;logic level&quot; USB serial port, like a PL2303 or a FT232, but now that's an explicit cost, rather than one lumped into &quot;do you have a parallel port&quot;.<br /><br />Adding a microcontroller dramatically increases the cost (you still need all the connectors), and even if you specify a USB-enabled microcontroller you don't actually save much over the separate USB-RS232 bridge and crappy micro. (Don't lie to me about how easy it is to use V-USB in a hard real-time system. It's not.) It doesn't even actually increase the availability to the end user, because PCI and PCIe parallel ports are still available, and cost about as much as a microcontroller plus programmer.<br /><br />On the other hand, you keep on running your mouth about How Other People Should Do Things and don't ever put your money where your mouth is. You have single-handedly diverted too many conversations by being toxic and loud.<br /><br />And here I go, feeding the troll...<br /><br />Could we split of Bregalad's rant from ccovell's original thread?

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />My small media pc (about the size of a PS2) has a parallel port on it with I do use. Many motherboards have headers for installing the parallel port. What is more of a problem is being able to use the parallel port in newer versions of Windows OS.<br /><br />There's nothing wrong with using the parallel port though. It's a readily available option for fun projects. Yes it would be nice if we could just smush a USB interface on everything but it just isn't that easy.

That and I'd like to understand why people think I'm a liar.  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_redface.gif" alt=":oops:" title="Embarassed" /> <br /><br />Are you saying that V-USB isn't easy from a developers standpoint or an end user's?  Or both?<br /><br />What you mean by 'a hard real-time system'.   I assume the FC/NES, but how is it a hard real-time system compared to any other computer like system?  Or is it that an mcu in general is challenging to interface with the FC/NES (not V-USB specifically)?
