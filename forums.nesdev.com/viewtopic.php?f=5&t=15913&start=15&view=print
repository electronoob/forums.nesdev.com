		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />&quot;Tatsumaki Senpukyaku&quot; is compressed in such a short sample that there's no way anyone can get that right. Combined with my total lack of knowledge of the japanese language at the time, I was torn between &quot;Ataque das Corujas&quot; (&quot;Attack of the Owls&quot;) and &quot;Ataque das Tartarugas&quot; (&quot;Attack of the Turtles&quot;). I knew it wasn't that, but since those sounded like Kung Fu techniques or something, it made some sense to use those names.

I may be confusing it with the arcade version.<br />I guess that was more based on the programmer's knowledge about the sound chip / architecture to make good voice clips.<br />Even the Street Fighter versions had a big laryngitis! The first Golden Axe voices really had it too!!<br /><br />Turtles IV on SNES really impressed me back in the day!!

It's just too funny that this and other hilarities made this originally not very good game a so-bad-it's-good cult-classic guilty pleasure.

To me, it sounds something like: &quot;Tats daik daik de rookat&quot;.<br />Anyway, it sounds like six syllables while &quot;Tatsumaki Senpu Kyaku&quot; are nine syllables.
