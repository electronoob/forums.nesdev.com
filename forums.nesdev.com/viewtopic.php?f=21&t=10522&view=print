I was talking to Kasumi who told me some stuff about NES gfx I did not yet know and that inspired me to start a new mockup which is true to the NES restrictions.<br /><br /><img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/15588722/nesmock3.png" alt="Image" /><br /><br />This is 55 8x8 tiles right now and uses 3 palettes (I am sure that is obvious).<br />I plan to chip away at this and add more things when I have time (which I do not have too much of atm, because I have quite a lot of work.)<br /><br /><img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/15588722/post/nesmock4c.png" alt="Image" /><br /><br />Latest:<br /><img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/15588722/post/nesdev/nesmock5wide.png" alt="Image" /><br /><br />New mockup action:<br /><img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/15588722/post/nesdev/nescute1.png" alt="Image" /><br /><br />Health displayed with sprites.

It's actually quite a coincidence that just a couple days ago I was checking/updating the &quot;ptoing&quot; section in my sprites folder!<br /><br />Very cool graphics you have there! You're pretty good at dodging color limitations, nearly everything you make appears to have more colors than it actually does. Welcome to NESDEV, hope we can see more of your art here!<br /><br />BTW, I'm kinda wondering what could Kasumi have told you about NES graphics that made you want to do mockups for it again... care to share?

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />We were just talking about the U-Head stuff I made and talking about palettes as well as the 32x32 pixel metatiles stuff most games use. I have not kept an eye on the 32x32s super much on this one yet (A but though), but it should be fine.<br /><br />Also the U-Head stuff was made with some PAL palette, not sure how accurate that one is, but it seems to be a lot nicer than the NTSC one (which this is). The thing about the NES NTSC palette is that you basically have 6 values, more or less. meaning black, white, and then each row of colours being one value with the greys at the left and right being offset by one up and down. All the colours in from 30 to 3F are more or less the same lightness and it is pointless to use them in the same 4 colour palette, as they blend, in 99% of all cases. This goes for the other rows as well, but a little less so. There are some cases I can see using 2 colours of the same row in the same sub palette, like for example if you have a palette to spare and just want some details in the back where shading does not matter, such as techy lights for example.<br /><br />The PAL palette does not have this problem, it actually has some contrast within the different rows, and not just between them. But it is good fun to pixel with the NTSC one too, extra challenge. I certainly enjoy it.

But I definitely want to work on NES game someday. (Don't even have a NES atm, derp)

It's a thing that happens in my game and some others, but keeping 16x16s in check will work fine. <br /><br />I made a super quick rom of the desert scene <a href="http://www.pixeljoint.com/pixelart/80652.htm" class="postlink">in this.</a> Don't worry, he already knows what things in those scenes won't truly work, no need to tell him. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=":wink:" title="Wink" />  (Can I post that rom, ptoing? I normally don't share stuff like that without asking, but uh... I guess now I'm shadily asking you publicly.) One other thing that may be worth posting is the fixed U-Head scene, but I'll leave that one to you.<br /><br />He's pretty serious about some kind of NES collab (though in the future, not right now). I'm working on some epic project (which you know <em>nothing</em> about, got it ptoing?), but if it ends up stable in some months you can bet I'm calling dibs on this collab.

I did this exact thing to test out my graphics &quot;as it would look&quot;.  I could help if you have any interest.<br /><br />You'll find out that some detail is lost and some is actually added, just because of how the NES cuts corners to get the display signal out.  A &quot;pixel&quot; doesn't really exist in CRT technology, is a big reason why.

You specify a 32-hex-digit NES palette, and savtool builds a .sav file containing the pattern table, nametable, and palette so that you can view it on an NES or in an emulator.
