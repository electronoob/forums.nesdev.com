		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I'm trying to find a pinout of the CIC chip for a HW project.  I didn't find it anywhere on the site, wiki, or web.  There was a mention that the pinout could be found in the patent documents, but I didn't see it in the diagrams for either of them.  I've pieced together this much so far:
<br />
<br />pin - function
<br />1 - DATA_OUT (output)
<br />2 - DATA_IN (input)
<br />3 - ??? (Pulled to VCC on NES/LOCK, Tied to GND on CART/KEY) (input)
<br />4 - KEY_/LOCK  (input)
<br />5 - ??? (seems to be a No Connect?)
<br />6 - 4Mhz clk (input)
<br />7 - RESET (input)
<br />8 - ??? (Seems to be tied to GND always) (input)
<br />9 -  RESET2 - for resetting CPU, PPU (output)
<br />10 - RESET1 - for resetting a KEY CIC, when in LOCK mode (output)
<br />11 - GND
<br />12 - GND
<br />13 - GND
<br />14 - GND
<br />15 - GND
<br />16 - VCC
<br />
<br />Any help filling in the missing pieces would be appreciated.  Also, can anyone confirm that I got pins 1 and 2 correct, I may have them backwards.

<br />I actually have it labelled as KEY_/LOCK, with the "_" indicating inverted.  That means a logic low would indicate KEY, and a logic high means LOCK which I'm pretty sure is correct.  I'll update the wiki with the info about pin 8, thanks again.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Ok, we're saying the same thing about pin 4, logic high makes the CIC a lock (i.e. in the console, which will assert the RESET lines), and logic low makes it a key (i.e. in the cart).
<br />
<br />For signals like CPU_R/W, the / usually indicates the part afterwards is the logic low, i.e. the one pin is both CPU_R, and /CPU_W, so to speak, which is why I misunderstood your terminology.
<br />
<br />Also, does anyone have any idea if it's OK to ground the N/C pins on the 6113B?  For now, I'm just going to design in a 0 Ohm resistor between the N/C or GND pins and true GND, so I can adapt for either kind of common american CIC (no idea about if PAL CICs come in these two or other variations, but they're all the same CPU with different ROM, so probably).

<br />
<br />
<br />I don't think it's critical.  I only have pin 8 connected to gnd on my cart, and it seems OK.  I think it'd be really bad for them to change a chip pinout in a revision (just call it a new part # in that case, heheh).
<br />
<br />Looking at 3 MHROM boards I have here, as it turns out among them they have 6113, 6113A, and 6113B1.  And they do have all the unused pins on gnd,  so there ya go.
<br />
<br />I have an idea for an external lockout chip connector that I'll likely use in future designs.  That way one lockout chip could more easily work with multiple carts.  Let me know if you're interested in something like that.  It's only any good if more than one design uses it.  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />

<br />
<br />I figured that the extra pins didn't matter one way or another, and must be internally tied low through a resistor or something (otherwise there's no way they'd leave them N/C on some carts).  I went ahead and wired them together, then through a smd pad just above the cic, so I could cut it or not depending on which donor cart the PCB went into.  Weirdly, on just about every board, some of the CIC lines (and on the MMC3 cart, a line from MMC3) went to the edge of the PCB and stopped, as if they were hooked up to test points on the portion of the board that got routed away, or something.
<br />
<br />Every MHROM board I've opened has been gloptop crap, which is a bummer since they're by far the cheapest donor carts you can get, I'm half tempted to take a bandsaw to the board around the CIC gloptops <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />

<br />
<br />Haha, yeah that's part of the plan.  Kevtris suggested that when we were messing around with them.  It's really convenient too, since the power and lockout pins are all nicely on the edge there.
<br />
<br />So I imagine you can see where this is going, heheh.  It can be soldered to (or maybe used with with a socket) on a dual-row 6 pin header.  Either that or another little PCB could be made that holds a regular lockout chip.

<br />So, my parts are on the way, and the PCBs are designed (I didn't leave a 2x3 strip to solder to after all, but soldering 6 air wires from the appropriate CIC holes to a chunk of card edge isn't much harder than soldering 6 jumpers from edge to edge).  Now I just need to find a place to get the boards made <img src="./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" />
<br />
<br />I put in a quote from myro several days ago and still haven't heard back, and most places don't offer 0.047 inch board thicknesses for prototypes <img src="./images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" alt=":(" title="Sad" />  Any other suggestions for an affordable place to get a few boards made (2 to 10), that can do non-standard thicknesses and 8 mil tracks?  My devkit and cart are actually two seperate PCBs, so a place that allows multiple designs / board is better, but I can split them if the tooling charge isn't too much.
<br />
<br />VHDL for the multi-mapper: done
<br />Equations for the devkit: done
<br />Firmware: haven't started, plenty of fun 6502 asm ahead (need to dig out my emulator and add support for the devkit and mappers, so I can do this without testing every 5 minutes).
<br />
<br />Neat features:
<br />The devkit also doubles as a NROM devcart in conjunction with a VRAM game that has the desired mirroring.

<br />I know I've asked Myro before about doing several boards on one setup, and they allow it (but naturally you have to always order the same amount of each).  I believe you'd send the design with both boards spaced 1mm apart.  If you heard about them from me, could you tell Robert I referred you?  I don't get kickbacks or nothing, but he helped me out a lot.  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Yah, I've got about a 3 mm seperation between the two designs, since I'll probably cut it with a bandsaw.
<br />
<br />Nope, different person.  My design includes everything it'll do in a single fusemap (all the discretes and mmc1), so it can be in-system-programmable using a controller-&gt;usb cable (I'll probably lock the final page of flash when the code is mostly stable so that users can't bork it).  I also started on a max 2 design (74xx, mmc1,2/4, native, and nsf done, haven't done mmc3 yet), that can do everything going except mmc5 (damn dual-port/dual-bus exram pretty much requires a fpga with block ram), but I wanted to do something simpler first.
<br />
<br />I'm using a EPM7064 for this design (got everything into a 7032 by squeezing very carefully, then I saw that the 7064 isn't much more expensive...)  All I could add was MMC1 though, not enough pins to bankswitch lower than 16 KB / 4 KB PRG / CHR, and to get that, I had to throw away my M2 clear reset circuit (grr, it's a shame I can't directly program the CPLDs, that'd buy me 4 extra pins currently used for JTAG).
<br />
<br />The devkit uses a ST PSD (flash+ram+cpld), and works similar to a copynes, but with extra RAM, an expansion port, but no direct PC interface.
<br />
<br />I found myro via google, but the reason I asked for a quote from them is because you used them for squeedo, so if they ever get back to me, I'll mention you.
<br />
<br />How much hastle was getting gold contacts, or have you done that yet?  pcbpro charges an extra $200 design review if you want to get gold plating, but they waive it for first-time customers (as a promotion right now), so if I make more than a handful of carts / devkits, I may go through them.

<br />Ah, yeah I remember that PCBPro place.  I was considering using them too but gave up because the mandatory design review.  Might not be too bad otherwise, but I'm not sure if it'd be as as good as Myro when it comes to extras (like solder mask colors for one).
<br />
<br />And the gold plating, actually I didn't put it on my first quote form because I was afraid it'd be too expensive.  After I sent them the design though, they said it looks like it could use gold fingers, heheh.  Turns out the cost was pretty negligable.
<br />
<br />So I made my rev1 board with electrolytic gold finish, and my rev2 board with gold fingers and HASL finish for the rest of it.

I haven't found a source for controller connectors yet though, so it'll be hardwired to a controller or built into a devkit for now (I didn't even order pcbs for it yet, but it's a simple point-to-point solder job).

<br />If you have access to the cart slot, you can hook NMI by looking for three writes in a row (which <em>only</em> happens on an interrupt) followed by reads from $FFFA and $FFFB. In practice, you can get away with just looking for a read from $FFFA.

If they only store records when the game strobes the controller, then it doesn't matter, but if they store say, key state per vblank, then it gets more complicated.
