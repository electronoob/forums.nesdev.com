It is also easier to do sprites for the first kind of cute. You can easily deform them and keep them looking adorable. In my personal opinion, i think you should shoot for a more innocent look versus slutty or temptress. It is easier to sympathize with a sweet girl in danger than a girl that looks like she can take care of herself, but if you can make it work more power to you. I still don't know what kind of mood you are shooting for in the game <img src="./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" />

<br />In a RPG with multi characters party, I'd say the best is one of each. RPGs are fun because you love all its party with all characters having their pros and flaws. But in a single-protagonist game, this protagonist must be an absolute flawless hero (ok it CAN have flaws, but only minor ones) that should be totally cool (think of Megaman, Belmot's family, etc...). Don't repeat the error of the crator of Tomb Raider games...

<br />You have a good point. There are other models for an action girl that aren't all fanservice. Smash Bros. alone has Zero Suit Samus and Sheik.

<br />
<br />Um, do you have an spc <strong>loading</strong> routine.
<br />
<br />Btw, what assembler are you using, it doesn't look the same as spcas.  Spcas doesn't allow macros.
<br />
<br />
<br />With the girl, I don't find her slutty looking, and I wasn't intending her to be.  I was trying to make a cross between Sailor Moon and Hatsune Miku.

<br />
<br />I would say try to make the look fit what ever personality you have in mind. Her outfit is strange for an average person to be walking around in, so in my brain I tried to associate what kind of work would she be doing in that outfit and all I could think of was stripper  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_redface.gif" alt=":oops:" title="Embarassed" /> . I suppose if she was coming from a comic con, a costume party, or different universe it could explain her unusual outfit. If you give context to the outfit I suppose it could work. I just don't know what frame to look at the character yet, as the story has yet been made. So I can't give any good input yet as to the character design <img src="./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" /> .

<br />She lives in another universe.  Would explain more, but going to bed.

<br />
<br />EDIT:  Couldn't sleep, too much on my mind.  Got up, tried once again today making Blargg's tone generating code xkas compatible.  Breaking News, I GOT IT TO WORK!  I finally have access to the SPC700!  Now I can go back to sleep.
