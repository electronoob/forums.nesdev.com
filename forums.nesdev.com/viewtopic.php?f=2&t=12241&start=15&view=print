Plus I want the resolution to be better than my previous attempt, and that would a downgrade. But what you're proposing is exactly what I figured can be done for pixels that are 2 scanlines tall.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />The jittering only happens if you set the scroll too late, when the PPU itself is already updating the scroll values and fetching tiles for the next scanline. There's a sufficiently large slice of time when it's safe to finish updating the scroll (i.e. the last $2006 write), but MMC3 IRQs fire too late in the scanline for you to make use of that time, so you have to wait until the next scanline to do it right.<br /><br />blargg's stuff is much more hardcore, targetting full synchronization between the CPU and PPU (like on the 2600, for example), and doesn't have much use in an actual game, because achieving the synchronization takes several frames and you have to use timed code to remain synchronized, IIRC.
