<br />Personally, I learned basic long ago with Visual Basic and my C64, then I moved to NES progamming... But heh, I did the fatal error to direcly have an RPG as my project... I think I'll finish it someday, but now I'm working on a simpler game, simply because it was too hard and because I haven't enough programming experience.
<br />Scince doing "tic tac toe" games are really boring for newbies, I think make techdemoes is much more interesting and effective. Still, "big" projects are a lot more interesting to design and to realise. I simply think people should be more assiociative, and exchange code, advices, and associate them to make decent games... Making a large game alone is very hard, but making one with friend would be much easier.
<br />There should be a system where someone could say "Hey, guys, I'm making an RPG, to make thing fast up, could someone help me to programm my battle engine, while I do the field engine ?" for example.
<br />Then, the roles could be reversed, the master would become slave and the slave would become master, so the guy that directed the RPG could help the guy that did his battle engine to make a platform game, for example.
<br />Everyone has to be cooperative, and interested in global projects instead of his own project.... this would simply be better.

<br />I wasn't around when that was first started, but such a project now would be very nice. I would be very interested in contributing somehow to a group project.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I think the main problem with this projet, is that it is actually designed by everyone. It's interesting, but everyone has it's <strong>own</strong> projects in mind. I mean, the typical guy with a project in head would be happy to have someone contribute to programming, but not someone meging it's ideas with his precise ideas. I think we shall make project with one or two designers, and much more relisator. The "designers" would be rather called director(s). The roles of the director(s) is to determine simply how would be the game, how would be the scenario, the gameplay, the story, witch mapper it uses and how it would hardwarely work, etc...
<br />Then, under his/their orders, a bunch of other people would help him/them to realise the game, code the engine, and make music, graphics, etc... But I insist on under his orders. Because a project would work less well if everyone has it's own ideas that are different or opposite, and it would eventually get suck. Of course, it may seem less fun to code the game of someone else... but it's still not terrible, scince someday it may be the opposite, so the man that programmed the engine or that did the graphics under the order of another man could, himself, become director and command the other one to work for him.
<br />Personally, I've a big RPG project with a friend of me, and we decided more or less how the story would be, how the four heroes would be, and I've "tried" to start programming... I'll restart it someday, sure, but I'd be happy if someone would make the field engine, programm the menu, and do the graphics <em>under my direction</em>. But I don't really want them to change how the heroes would be nor change the story, etc... Of course if they have fair ideas, they can sill mention it to me, then I'll decide if they are aproved or not. It's pretty much like this that "official" gaming companies works.
<br />Also, the same engines would be possible to use from a game to another game, but customisation *should* be possible. I mean, once a big RPG has be made, another once would be made faster scince there is already a field engine, an event engine, etc... But the director certainly want different features than the previous director, so it would need some changes, and that sould be possible without re-programming the whole thing.
<br />For example Contra and Life force uses a similar scroling engine, but one is a space shooter and the other one a platformer, so Konami didn't use exacly the same engine, but only part of it (scrooling), while the gameplay is totally different.
<br />
<br />Here you are some ideas. I have an RPG in mind (in addition to the simpler game I'm making), Tokumaru has at least one platformer in mind, Celius had several games in mind, espectially FFVII version NES that won't be easily realisable, and he's sill new to programming, but I'm pretty sure he don't want someone that would change his main ideas, but he probably would be happy to have a bunch of people helping him at programming and giving fair ideas without imposing him to agree, if you see what I mean.
<br />So there are enough potential directors to start. It's just better for every one to have a leader rather than having everyone giving it's own ideas and the final product eventually turn into gabarage. May seem military, but I'm pretty sure it would work better.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I don't know if I am really happy with this concept of directors... We surelly need some coordinator for the project, but not some sort of "boss" that will tell everyone to do what's in his mind. I agree that nobody will ever want people messing with their characters and story, and that's why I don't think a group project should come from our personal projects.
<br />
<br />It should be started from the very bottom... People could brainstorm ideas for the main storyline, and we'd all vote to get a winner. Actually, before the storyline we should vote for the style of the game! But RPG will most likely win, wich I'm not that happy about, but can live with.
<br />
<br />If we keep voting for every aspect of the game, wich we're building from the ground, no one will be upset for having their dream project screwed over. This way it may take a little longer for the actual start of development, but it will be worth it.
<br />
<br />When most things are decided, every one would say how they want to contribute and the tasks can be distributed. Some thought must be put on how this thing could work, but I believe it can work. It doesen't hurt to try... We may get faster results like this than working by ourselves...

<br />Actually I would. I'm not really against such maneers to set things up, but I simply can't be happy with that. Because if there is vote, that may seem that there is more than one idea, and if there is more than one idea, that may seem that my idea may be refused for a game that originally started by me... I can't be happy with that. I have my own RPG in mind, I'm really not against people helping to set things up, as I'm not against helping someone else to set his thing up, but I'm really against with someone coming and merging his idea with me to eventually got it misplaced and not really what I originally had in mind. That wouldn't mean that his ideas are bad, but that would mean that they would fit only in a second project and not in the same game.
<br />Well, a game designed by two or three people would be okay, but no way anything decent could be designed by fourteen persons. I mean that this would go in all direction and the group will eventually have tensions in it with people disagreeing by the idea of another one or by the bad quality of realisation of something in function of their original hopes, and the group will get suck, and the project too. However, if a small group or a single person ask people to help with precise ideas in mind and explain them correctly what they are waiting from them, this cause no problem.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Well, Bregalad, the thing is I don't think it should be someone's game. We'll start from the ground. You are not going to suggest we use your RPG idea, wich you have been thinking about for so long. We'll all just go like: "Hum... I want a outer space themed RPG" and "We should do a medieval themed RPG!" and so on... Then we'd vote for a winner. Then we'd begin formulating the characters and storyline from there.
<br />
<br />I agree it is not productive at all to have a huge bunch of people deciding on every little detail of the game, but everyone should contribute for the general theme and feel of the game. Then the writters come in and make the actual story. Only a few people will work as writers, so there will not be such a big confusion.
<br />
<br />I'm just saying. I can't be sure this would work, and I don't think many are up to the task. The manager of the project would go crazy. Many beginners/newbies may want to join, but then there is a limit to how much they are able to contribute, and then we'd have a large number of members in the project and not be able to divide the tasks evenly and move on with the thing at a reasonable pace.
<br />
<br />I don't know... The idea seemed nice, but if everyone thinks it's such a bother there is no point in trying it. You guys probably learned something from the last experience. It may have gone really bad that no one wants to try it again, or maybe you could use previous experience to enrich the next one. I really don't know what happened the last time.
<br />
<br />Not many people have manifested anyway, there doesn't seem to be much interest on it...

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />You now what? I think I got excited about this cooperative thing in the first place because I don't know one single person in real life that appreciates this kind of thing. Game programming, I mean. Specially on old consoles like the NES. Some people actually give me some ugly looks when I say I make NES programs. Everyone here thinks the NES is such a bad and ugly game system...
<br />
<br />So, having the chance to work along with people that can see the magic on old consoles, specifically the NES, seemed really nice.
<br />
<br />My relationship with the NES is really weird. I never owned one, and always thought I was in a better situation then my friends because I had a megadrive/genesis when they all had NES's. I bought my first NES/famiclone when the Dreamcast was already out for a long while (maybe even the PS2 was already out!), after I fell in love with it's games, wich was at the time emulators became popular.
<br />
<br />Soon I decided to program for it and here I am now. Everyone I know underestimates the NES and it is nice to be here, in a place where everyones loves the old little console. I really love the damn thing, since I have no nostalgia whatsoever.

I simply couldn't make programming for a game and let someone else take care about the story or something... I simply couldn't support that. I want neither design the whole thing or help someone else to design his whole thing. You know, a game is really great when all it's aspects (music, graphics, stroy) mix up to make a gigantic aspect, so the game has it's own style of music, his own style of graphics, his own unique gamplay, etc... It's what happened to the most popular series, Megaman, Final Fantasy, Castlevania, Fire Emblem, etc....
<br />If the different aspects of the games split up, then the whole thing can get suck.
