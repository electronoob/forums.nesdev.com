What title should I have used instead for this topic?<br /><br />3. How can I recognize situations like this in the future where I will have done wrong?<br /><br />4. What should I do differently in each such situation?</div><br /><br />1. Is not for me to address (although I think the original had an exclamation mark after classic), but if I were in the author's shoes, I'd be satisfied by now.<br /><br />2. Something like &quot;Handling Game Descriptions with Intentional Misdirection&quot; is likely how I'd phrase it… just something that would either be neutrally stated (or if neutral phrasing isn't available, erring on the side of positive connotation out of respect for those whose work is being discussed). Bait and switch has a strong negative connotation. Using it to describe someone else's work impolite at best, outright insulting at worst.<br /><br />3. When contemplating a change, ask yourself, &quot;Why would the author have done it this way to begin with?&quot; and if you can't come up with a good reason, asking the author directly, would be a good start.<br /><br />4. If at all possible, when contemplating a change, post it for the author to approve. If the change is drastic, phrase it as a suggestion or request.  For instance, &quot;I feel description x is inappropriate for this reason. Would it be okay if I used description y instead?&quot; If the answer returned is still unsatisfactory to you, then allowing the author to come up with a solution. Such as, &quot;I'm still uncomfortable with x. I would like to achieve [goal]. Is there a solution you have in mind that would achieve both (my desired goal and yours)?&quot;<br /><br />I appreciate the uniformity in formatting, and I fully understand and appreciate the need for grammatical and spelling corrections, etc. (I had to make a few of those on the poster for last year's) But, like Frankengraphics pointed out, there is a long enough time prior to publication to allow for mutually agreed upon corrections to be made. This is not only important for showing courtesy to the author, but also for accuracy. Sometimes your changes may end up including inaccurate information based on an honest misunderstanding (such as seems to be the case in the current Grunio A53 description, but I'll address that in its appropriate thread.)

Thanks for explaining it.<br /><br />I feel that the screenshot (including its poor graphics, and basic description) were designed to give me low expectations for the game. The fact that it was submitted to the competition is what urged me to fiddle around with the controller under the assumption &quot;certainly no one would submit something this unplayable, right?&quot;<br /><br />To me, the above seems obvious.

The thing that upsets me is that <em>in my opinion</em>, the menu should appear to be a neutral arbiter, and <em>because</em> to me &quot;remake&quot; implies things that this isn't, and that in turn negatively affects the appearance of neutrality of the menu.</div><br />If the term &quot;remake&quot; was the only thing initially disputed, I have little doubt that an adequate description satisfactory to both parties would have been achieved long ago.<br /><br />However, we shouldn't forcibly alter the player's experience with the game (even if that experience is viewed as negative by some) has been my primary argument.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I don't think &quot;bait and switch&quot; is even negative anymore, at least not in the context of releasing stuff online. Nowadays in Internet culture you've got things like Siivagunner high quality rips, where intentionally misrepresenting the thing you're posting is the whole point, and then having it lead into something else (and surprising a viewer that's unfamiliar with it) is popular and playful.<br /><br />When I saw Star Evil, combined with F-FF misrepresenting itself as a boring racing game, I thought that sort of playfulness was exactly what pubby was going for.

Pause Ahead, I feel most people play expecting the gimmick.

HOWEVER it's mitigated entirely by you at least being open about it. You haven't actually <em>committed</em> this act of censorship, you merely stated an intent to do so publicly, and you were de facto looking for commentary on it. In truth it <em>was</em> the suggestion it should be, only it wasn't initially worded that way.<br /><br /><br />(Smaller changes benefit from similar treatment. &quot;I found some spelling errors&quot; is vastly superior to &quot;I fixed your spelling errors.&quot;)

The bigger question is who decides what message players are to be presented with prior to playing the game.  Provided it's not obscene I honestly think this should be up to the creator.  While I get the arguments for the menu to be neutral, the risks/damages involved with over ruling creator's expression are much more significant than some number of players not enjoying or getting that one game because of a sentence.  <br /><br />Ultimately creator is the one responsible for making a game that's an enjoyable experience for their targeted player and the instructions are an extension of the game.<br /><br />If people playing the game have recommendations to the creator on how the instructions could have be improved, the creator can choose what to do with that feedback.  I don't feel this is something we need to regulate as compo/cartridge organizers.
