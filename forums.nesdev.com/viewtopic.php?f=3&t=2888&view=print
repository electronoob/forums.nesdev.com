		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />- The PPU address bit rising/falling thing seems too complex. Most emulators were using CRCs to identify a certain ROM and a "best" IRQ method of counting, using PPU scanlines as reference. An hack to fix some titles such as MegaManIII was to check the sprite pattern bank 0000h or 1000h.
<br />
<br />- Is there an alternate method for proper MMC3 emulation, or near enough? My PPU code renders using tilecaching + pixel-by-pixel, without pre-caching tiles like the NES does. Well, that's it.

(You should see my current MMC3 code...  hoooo boy!)<br /><br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">Is there an alternate method for proper MMC3 emulation, or near enough?</div><br /><br />Before I implimented MMC3's IRQ counter based on A12 rises, I simply had a function which I called every scanline around cycle 260.  That function would clock the IRQ counter once provided all of the following were true:<br /><br />- PPU is on<br />- 8x8 sprites:  BG uses different pattern table than sprites ($2000.3 != $2000.4)<br />- 8x16 sprites:  BG uses left pattern table ($0xxx)<br /><br /><br />That seemed to work "good enough" for most games.  I was even able to get some trickier games like Kickmaster working without CRC checks or anything.<br /><br />Using this method meant that my MMC3 code was then tied to my PPU code -- something which was kind of weird (but I guess it worked).  However this is avoidable.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">My PPU code renders using tilecaching + pixel-by-pixel, without pre-caching tiles like the NES does.

<br />
<br />If you want to stick with the A12 route -- how your PPU renders doesn't need to play any role in how you emulate MMC3's IRQ counter.  In fact in my current emu -- the PPU and MMC3 counter operate completely independently (although my MMC3 does need to "see" certain things in the PPU).  If you're interested I can explain how my current system works and perhaps draw some diagrams or something.  But it'd be a pretty big explanation so I don't want to post it unless you're really interested.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />It's not that complex, there are simpler ways to have the same effect.  Just look for the few things that will change the PPU address.
<br />
<br />This post says it all:
<br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">If sprites are set to $1000-1FFF and the background is set to $0000-0FFF, then A12 will <strong>change from 0 to 1 at cycle 260 of each scanline</strong>, then change from 1 to 0 at cycle 320 of each scanline.<br /><br />If sprites are set to $0000-0FFF and the background is set to $1000-1FFF, then A12 will change from 1 to 0 at cycle 256 of each scanline, then <strong>change from 0 to 1 at cycle 324 of each scanline</strong>.<br /></div>
<br />
<br />And make sure to not have it increment if sprites and BG are on the same pattern table, otherwise you break Kick Master.
<br />
<br />When sprites are 8x16, and none are displayed on the scanline, it gets sprite data from 1000-1FFF.
<br />
<br />If 8x16 sprites take data from the left pattern table, then you advance the counter more times than it's supposed to, and it breaks the status bar in Mario Adventure.
<br />
<br />Monitoring all writes to the PPU Address to see if any change the IRQ counter is only useful if you're trying to pass blarrg's tests.  I don't think any game actually relies on this.

<br />Would you rather have <ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha"><li>accurate at 50 percent speed on a handheld device, </li><li>hacky at 100 percent speed on a handheld device, or </li><li>accurate at 50 percent speed on a large, expensive laptop? </li></ol> Accurate, fast, small: choose two. That's the breaks when your target platform has only 280,896 CPU cycles to emulate 29,780.5 NES CPU cycles.

<br />Probably so. It's worth implementing even if just to pass my test, since without this behavior it's harder to test the scanline counter operation in an emulator-independent way.
