		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Ok, I've run into this dilemma:
<br />
<br />First off, I'm writing an NES emulator (obviously)
<br />
<br />I originally thought that it was none of our business to worry about what notation the ROM/Programmer is using during any instruction (one's complement, two's complement, decimal notation, etc.). I realized this when I had to manipulate the processor status flag after an instruction and I was checking bits etc.
<br />
<br />But heres where stuff confuses me. I came across an instruction:
<br />
<br />0x10 0xfb
<br />
<br />0x10 is Branch on N = 0.
<br />
<br />But branching is the part I don't understand: how do I intrepret 0xfb? Do I convert it to twos complement and then add it to the program counter? Do I just intrpret it AS-IS? Is 0xfb signed or unsigned? Its confusing the hell out of me, and I don't know how the ROM wants me to branch.
<br />
<br />Much Appreciated.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Also, it's a relative address added to the address AFTER the branch instruction.  So for example, some kind of branch which specifies FE (-2) as the branch length would be an infinite loop if followed.  A branch which specifies 00 would basically be a no-op, since it would either run on to the next instruction, or jump to the exact same position.

<br />
<br />Unsigned.
<br />
<br />Strictly speaking, A could be thought of as signed under some circumstances (adding $FF has the exact same result as subtracting $01).  But the emulator need not concern itself with this.  The only thing the emulator needs to treat as signed is the relative branch address.

<br />I thought the same.... however, my issue is when DEX gets executed (decrease X by one)... If X is currently 0, it needs to wraparound to -128 or 255. Thats why we need to know if its signed/unsigned right? What do we do in this case?
<br />
<br />Stricly speaking, what you said makes perfect sense, and I've been implementing it exactly like that. I just came across this issue and I'm not sure what to do.

<br />
<br />It doesn't matter.  It would be the same in either case.  That's the beauty of 2's compliment.
<br />
<br />if X=0 and you DEX, the result would be X=FF.  Which makes sense if X is unsigned (wrap 0 -&gt; 255) <em>and</em> X is signed (no wrap  0 -&gt; -1). 
<br />
<br />Same if X is $80 and you DEX -- X would be $7F.  Makes sense if unsigned (no wrap 128 -&gt; 127) and if X is signed (wrap -128 -&gt; 127)
