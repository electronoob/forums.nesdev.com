<br />Perhaps someone inferred sarcasm from the phrasing. Some people's sarcasm detectors are mistuned, and this appears especially common among programmers for some reason. It may take extra effort to get across that a particular comment is in sarcasm mode or sincerity mode.

<br /><a href="http://sysadminday.com/" class="postlink">There has been for years</a>, it's just that the entire world (not this board, I really do mean the majority of the world) doesn't care enough to consider celebrating it in some way.  I guess I can't blame people, because most "admins" of things these days tend to not know anything about what they're administrating, so we actual admins are left celebrating it ourselves, by ourselves, with a beer or some tears.  :-)

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />While I don't know all the technical details behind phpBB and MediaWiki, it seems like it ought to be possible to tie the wiki user accounts directly to the board accounts. So only board accounts in good standing even have wiki accounts.
<br />
<br />That would allow your existing spam fighting to also combat wiki spammers (even if they only spam account creation). It would also remove the need for board members who want to edit the wiki to explicitly sign up, and also remove the admin overhead (small as it probably is) of  approving such requests.
<br />
<br />Of course, such a move would require developing a plug-in for phpBB, MediaWiki, or both. (Or, perhaps, some sort of standalone script that could be run from a cron job.) I suppose there may not be admin time (or skills, depending) to develop such a thing, but if there is, I think it would be an elegant solution.

<br />
<br />Since the real new users on the wiki are quite small, the return on investment would be too small unfortunately.
