Definitely more complicated to implement, though. And a good performance hit for a 24bpp-&gt;30sim dithering. Also not sure if static dithering is good enough, or if you'd want it to change per frame. Basically it crushes 32 different luminance levels into 0% to about 1.5% brightness. That's only three or so levels with 24-bit colors, so all the details get smashed together.<br /><br />But yeah, for my 1024 step bar, I can't personally tell the difference between true 30-bit and 24-bit+dithering. And I have great vision.

I think I've heard musings of the $600+ GeForces supporting it, but I wouldn't count on it. My bet is you'll only get 24-bit color over their DisplayPorts.</div><br />I think I know from where this comes: if I recall correctly the GeForce can handle 64-bit framebuffers without much issue (and I'd assume Radeon can, too). The problem is that the framebuffer and the output video signal are completely different things. The extra bits are there for increased math accuracy in shaders and such, not for improved video output.<br /><br />And as for the dithering: I'd imagine it's only a good option if the resolution is high enough (such that each emulated pixel ends up showing a pattern). I'd say that at least 4x the SNES resolution would be needed to be considered acceptable, but who knows. On the upside, at least dithering can be easily done with a shader, so no need to spend CPU time on that.

Maybe not so much on laptops.

FCEUX indeed only shows blue stripes, and it also appears to have problems with the color emphasis.
