Good luck, let's hope it'll work for you, too! <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">MottZilla wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">I updated my PowerPAK last night.

Which is a lot. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_surprised.gif" alt=":o" title="Surprised" /><br /><br />So I've been thinking for quite some time about relocating the buffer from WRAM to SDRAM, of which the PowerPak has a whopping 16 MB (128 Mbit) to offer. What a blast! <img src="./images/smilies/icon_lol.gif" alt=":lol:" title="Laughing" /> Now theoretically, half -- and only, ever, half -- of all this monstrous space could be used for storing directory content: $FFFF entries * 128 bytes each = 8 MB. That would be 65,535 entries per directory. (Compare that to the current design, where we are limited to 512 entries!)<br /><br />So I sat down this very evening and tried to implement new &quot;CardLoadDir&quot;/&quot;DirPrintDir&quot;/&quot;DirGetEntry&quot;/&quot;DirFetchEntry&quot; routines using SDRAM as a buffer, just to prove to myself it was possible at all. To my own surprise, with success. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt=":mrgreen:" title="Mr. Green" /> (Note how I had to fall back to using multiplication registers instead of the slightly faster M7X PPU registers, as the latter seem to expect signed values only.)<br /><br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">; *********************** Fetch entry from SDRAM ***********************<br /><br />; This function calculates the current entry's SDRAM buffer address.<br />; 65536 ($FFFF * $80) entries are supported at the max.

I can only make an educated guess, but actually using the filebrowser feels at least 1/4 faster than before. And no trouble loading Syvalion (j) from a directory with ~800 ROMs starting with the letter S. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /><br /><br />There are drawbacks, though. First of all, I'll have to readjust a couple of routines I'd thought to be finished once and for all (e.g. page-by-page navigation, SRAM auto-matching) due to the PowerPak's SDRAM DMA port hardware implementation (featuring auto-increment). Second, I was hoping to get away with a CF module-only upgrade. No way though! The goddamn scrolling routine makes use of ye olde DirPrintEntry during Vblank. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt=":roll:" title="Rolling Eyes" /> Worst of all, I'll have to keep the original directory loading / WRAM buffering code anyway. This is because one of the key software design features of the PowerPak is being able to access the CF card file system <em>before</em> even programming the FPGA and/or unlocking SDRAM.<br /><br />To summarize, this will be more than enough work for a 2.10 release. Which is not going to happen soon. But you bet that it will happen. Because the SNES PowerPak is awesome. Because the SNES PowerPak deserves one blast of a firmware.<br /><br />Long live the SNES PowerPak! <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Thanks for the input, guys! <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />Concerning directory buffering, I've actually considered a database approach similar to e.g. sd2snes before. Problem is, I have very much close to zero experience when it comes to efficient data structure implementation. (And I don't have the FPGA file's sourcecode either, so everything would have to be done on the SNES CPU). Apart from that, the PowerPak's rudimentary FAT implementation would have to be redone from scratch in order to allow reliable saving of larger files (of any given size, and even if the existing target file is of a different size) onto the CF card.<br /><br />Implementing dynamic filename buffer allocation <em>without</em> a CF database wouldn't make much sense in my opinion. Imagine having to wait for the buffer to be rebuilt every single time you launch the filebrowser, or navigate to another directory, or choose a ROM with SRAM, especially when your ROM collection is huge. Most of the time, you'd be staring at &quot;Loading ...&quot; messages. No fun at all.<br /><br />Of course, the prospect of maxing out the number of supported files per directory, seeing filenames sorted alphabetically, doing fully dynamic filename comparisons (for SRAM auto-matching), and/or even adding gimmicks like auto-scrolling of longer filenames, sounds exciting. To be honest, even attempting to tackle the database thing, though not impossible per se, seems well beyond what time and effort I'm willing to further invest in this project.<br /><br />Thus, right now I feel that concentrating on improving and optimizing the way things are currently implemented is the best approach. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">thefox wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">Multiplying by 128 is the same as shifting left 7 times.

However, if I try to update to your beta 1 on your website, I get black screen when I turn the powerpak on.  Is there a beta 2 flash.bin floating around?</div><br />The betas are older than the version you have in the flash updater. A downgrade is NOT recommended. There's not even a flash updater included in the beta releases either, hence the blackscreen. Just stick to the POWERPAK files that came with the flash updater. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />
