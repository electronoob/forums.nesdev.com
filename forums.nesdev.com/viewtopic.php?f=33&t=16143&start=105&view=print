Further work is just enhancing the game for the cart, so cart buyers get the best product possible.<br /><br />But I think we should discuss this issue elsewhere and stop polluting this thread.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />i just played for the first time and it's quite impressive! nice setting, mood, music, art, and gameplay. <br /><br />i like to try to give constructive critiques and obviously you can feel free to ignore, but i felt like there was one thing that was holding back the flow of the game: you appear to lose all momentum when you either finish a roll or land a jump.<br /><br />for example, right here:<br /><br /><div class="attachtitle">Attachment:</div><div class="attachcontent">
			<a href="./download/file.php?id=11832&amp;mode=view"><img src="./download/file.php?id=11832&amp;t=1" alt="wolf.png" /></a><br />
			<span class="gensmall">wolf.png [ 17.47 KiB | Viewed 1987 times ]</span>
		

		<br />
	</div><br /><br />my instinct is to land the first jump and to immediately jump again. however, when i land the first jump and lose all velocity, then the second jump just winds me up in the pit (happened to me my first 4 games...). similarly, in wolf form, i instinctively want to use the 'momentum' from a roll to leap forward (which i think would be a LOT of fun to get a nice big leap at the tail end of a roll), but it doesn't work like that!<br /><br />just my two cents! very nice entry.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />@Katsumi: Yes, you're right, I could reproduce it. Thanks! (5650 points? Hui!)<br /><br />@toggle switch: Yes, the momentum vanishes on each touchdown. Obviously, Ling isn't a good triple jumper.  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /> <br />Anyway, I think you're right, the ability to do multiple jumps without losing the momentum could be a nice tweak to the controls. And you're not the first one telling me this, I'll think about it.<br />With this feature, it would be possible to add some kind of jump challenge where you can only pass when you're doing multiple jumps with full momentum. Interesting.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Things i really like with this game:<br />-Great style!<br />-If you ignore the the characteristics of nes graphics in general, it feels a bit like a commodore or DOS game. It's in the philosophy of the  controls, the status text printout, the split HUD, little things like that. It feels refreshing!<br />-the ambition and fine granularity of the collisions makes a richly varied platforming experience possible. <br />-the &quot;modern&quot; camera<br />-level + graphical assets makes me want to explore, and that's great fun!<br /><br />Critique:<br />-I had the about the same problem as toggle switch with the controls. It takes some time getting used to (which is fine), but the control scheme feels just a bit like a translator between me and the game (i guess all control schemes have this role, but it's less transparent here), and i need to think a bit more carefully how i phrase things to the translator in order for it to translate my intentions to the game as intended. Maybe a study case, although it's quite different in its aims and designs, would be metroid (nes). It also has two jumping modes. Perfectly controlling which one to use takes a bit of learning, but the consequences for failing isn't as harsh.<br /><br />-I find it maybe a little too easy to trig the (re)transformation by mistake - but maybe better habits would settle when playing this game on repeated occasions. In any case, i would've prefered select, i think (it's usually the goto character selection button), which also would mean transformations can happen at the exact time i press the button<br /><br />-There's frequently little collision bugs here and there. You probably already know about these? Nothing too serious as it is mostly cosmetic, or else just a hickup in the flow of the game. I haven't gotten stuck or anything because of it.

Perhaps this is the problem. (ie. the reset code might expect bank #0 to be in place).
