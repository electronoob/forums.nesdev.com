<br />Those seems to allow to play FC, NES, SFC and SNES games on your SNES console without the need of anyother adaptater. Sounds pretty confortable.
<br />I of course already have separate NES console and universal adaptater for both consoles, but always switching the power supply and AV output from my NES to my SNES, and always switch the adaptaters in and out in quite annoying.
<br />Since the adaptater is unlicenced, I think there is no way it can replace the NES in therms of accuracy.

You could grab an extra snes &amp; nes and toss them in a single case if you wanted.
<br />
<br />A while ago I was going to make a snes/nes combo using just the snes controllers and a single cart slot (with a nes-&gt;snes dongle). The only thing stopping me was the fact that if I wanted to make sure nothing would fry I'd need 18 4066 chips to switch the cart lines <img src="./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" /> Who knows, maybe the nes/snes can stand up to the voltage on the cart slot when it's not on.

<br />
<br />Two, you have to route the SNES AV through the Tristar, so S-Video/RGB is not possible out of the NES part (and SNES even??).
<br />
<br />Three, the FC or Famiclones don't "emulate" FDS or VRC6/7 sound chips; they just pass audio signals through.  But it is a good question whether the Tristar passes the audio through.

<br />Also, the adapaters are unlicenced, becasue Nintendo would want to make more money of people still buying NES when the SNES was out.
<br />
<br />I think it isn't much harder to deal with original NES and SNES, but I tought I could save space in the room. After all I already had hard time to modify my NES mechanically and elecrtically to play Just Breed with sound. I'd still be curious to see one.
<br />Does anyone think I have chances found it in a garage sale here in europe ? Or is it only available expensivly on the net ?

<br />
<br />It does, I've played on one quite a bit a while back.  Don't know about FDS RAM cart, but it does work with other audio expanded carts.
<br />
<br />It's still a Famiclone, but I thought it was pretty cool.  And it has correct sound.
<br />
<br />Bregalad: I kinda doubt you'll be able to find one for what it was worth originally.  It's got value to collectors because it's cool and seems to be rare, and to hardware hackers because the NES-on-a-chip is on a nifty little carrier board.  Unless you can still get lucky and buy it from a non-collector, heheh.
<br />
<br />There's also a Tristar 64, for the N64 that runs NES/FC and SNES games.

<br />Don't touch that though because if you think clone FC are bad, the SFC are worse! You should know Memblers with the GameStation :)

<br />That'd be cool, heheheh.
<br />I don't have a N64 anyway and I'm not really willing to have one. I just trough this adaptater would be cool.
<br />Nintendo is stupid. After seeing some chineese people have devlopped this adaptater, they sould have done similar licenced ones.
<br />How accurate are NES-on-a-chips ? Since they are "real" NES emulator (with it's real inputs and outputs) they must be more accurate than many NES PC emulators.

<br />My NES PC emulator has a real input for a Nintendo brand controller (a USB adapter) and a real output for a TV. The NOAC can be inaccurate for the same reason Nesticle was inaccurate: register accesses don't have the correct side effects. For instance, one popular NOAC seems to switch square wave duty cycles 01 (25%) and 10 (50%), and it doesn't access VRAM bytes in the same order (which MMC5 games rely on for raster timing).

<br />
<br />Cloning the SNES's APU was apparently too difficult to do correctly for pirates.  Then again, it was pretty advanced for its time.  Apparently clones also used a standard as opposed to custom CPU.
<br />
<br />With regards to hardware pirate clones compared to emulators for the PC, for the NES the emulators for your PC, such as Nintendulator and Nestopia, are far more accurate and compatible than a NOAC based clone.  That is true until somebody builds a better NOAC, which will most likely never happen due to costs.

<br />
<br />As far I know there is still one or two mystery about the SPC700 here and there even in the last version of SNES9x wich has the higher compatibility.
<br />Anit-resonnance SPC player seems to be the only one to decode overflow-drived noisy sample correctly (used in most Capcom and Squaresoft games). If you play Megaman X or Chrono Trigger, the SFX will sound slightly different in an emulator as opposed to the hardware.
