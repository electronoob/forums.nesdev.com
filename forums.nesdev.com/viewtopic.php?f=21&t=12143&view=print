		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Well...Arne's palette might <em>seem</em> random, but from an artist's perspective it's actually a pretty great palette. It's an analog palette like the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_8-bit_computer_hardware_palettes#C-64" class="postlink">C64 palette</a>, where everything was hand-picked to work best for low-resolution pixel art graphics. Giving all of your hues an equal number of shades is actually a really bad idea, because then you'll end up with lots of ugly, unusable magentas like in the <a href="http://i1259.photobucket.com/albums/ii552/TheBladejunker/EGA%20Now/EGAstuff7_zpsd71e83d4.png" class="postlink">EGA palette</a>. Notice how the palette lacks any skin colors, so you have to make everyone look like a crab-faced mutant?<br /><br />On the other hand, if you look at analog palettes like the famous <a href="http://www.pixeljoint.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=12795" class="postlink">Dawnbringer 16</a>, you'll see that hand-picking your colors makes a huge difference. Both EGA and DB16 have 16 colors to work with, but the latter looks waaay better!<br /><br />But with that being said, I do think arne could have organized his palette a lot better. I've attempted to organize it into a nice grid at least a million times and I've always failed.

I was actually able to organize EGA into some nice ramps for my own purposes!<br /><br /><img src="http://fc07.deviantart.net/fs71/f/2014/348/2/5/6_bit_palette_by_dragondeplatino-d89vv4f.png" alt="Image" /><br /><br />EGA (not CGA, sorry about that) is really cool because even though it's a machine-generated palette, it's actually really usable for pixel art. There's a nice mix of high-saturation and low-saturation colors and a neat pattern to how big each ramp is...Primary/secondary RGB colors have 6 colors in their ramps, tertiary colors have 2 colors and quaternary colors have 1 color each.<br /><br />Also, keeping things on subject...would it be possible to make an NES ROM using EGA colors? I know NES hardware can't generate RGB colors, but in theory could one create an emulator palette file and get games to run in EGA? You'd have to completely redo a game's graphics from the ground-up and the game wouldn't work on actual hardware, but it would be an interesting experiment. Hmm...

I mean, modulo the bits about how the NES has eight three-color palettes and the SMS has two fifteen-color palettes, and the SMS can't do split screen...<br /><br /><br />The Dawnbringer 16 palette is ... more-or-less completely divorced from the constraints of what made the market move in the way it did. It's made without an eye to the hardware constraints imposed by using RGB or YUV, and his stated intention to rely on halftoning makes it collide badly with PAL and NTSC. The specific colors he's chosen are randomly all over the place in terms of RGB and YUV values, so there's no hardware advantage to such a fixed palette, either (unlike the VIC20 and C64, where there were five fixed brightnesses, and seven (out of 16) predefined chroma angles chosen.)<br /><br />So it's more or less only usable as a software palette. Which is fine! the Macintosh's and VGA's 16-color modes would have benefited. (In fact, a number of games released before Windows95 and the ubiquity of 256-or-more-color VESA modes look rather like this). But those are highish resolution modes, so the crunchy low-res aesthetic doesn't jibe with reality. And the VGA high-resolution mode doesn't leave enough memory to double buffer what's onscreen, in addition to making full-screen updates a pain because of the <a href="http://wiki.osdev.org/VGA_Hardware#Memory_Layout_in_16-color_graphics_modes" class="postlink">planar layout</a>.

Most TMS9918 descendants (NES PPU, SMS VDP, S-PPU, MD VDP) use a really shortcutty 1980s design, but something that outputs YUV and applies the correct low-pass filter to UV channels before combining them with Y will make the checkerboards blend properly.

In the conversion to EGA color, some things improved (more browns and super-smooth ? block flashing) while some things came out worse (oversaturated greens).

Remember that the Donkey Kong arcade itself was based on tilemaps and sprites (it just lacked scrolling), and it certainly wasn't the first arcade to have that either, so it's not like Nintendo took the idea from the Colecovision.<br /><br />May as well say that every system using tilemaps and sprites is a TMS9918 derivative.</div><br />But was there a tilemaps and sprites picture generator on a <em>single chip</em> with greater than 160 pixels across before the TMS9918? The TMS9918 proved that full LDTV-resolution tilemaps and sprites, as opposed to a dumb frame buffer like an Apple II or CGA or a chunky 160x96 tile plane like Odyssey 2 or INTV, could be done in a console. Notice how chunky Mario is in every pre-NES home Mario game other than <em>Donkey Kong</em> for ColecoVision:<br /><br /><a href="http://nfggames.com/games/MarioSprites/" class="postlink"><img src="http://nfggames.com/games/MarioSprites/marios5.png" alt="Image" /><br />Mario sprites on pre-NES consoles</a><br />Atari 800 Donkey Kong, Atari 800 Mario Bros, ColecoVision, Intellivision, Commodore 64, Atari 2600<br /><br />What no one realized at the time was that it's possible to make colorful sprites on a C64 without making it look too chunky, by using two sprites: one full-res for the outline and one half-res for the innards.
