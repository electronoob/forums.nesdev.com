ALL the info I got came from <strong>Disch</strong>, and <em>some details</em> from blargg's test ROMs. Again, it's a big surprise to me of how most of you don't even know about the MMC3 IRQ logic - a <span style="text-decoration: underline">CHANCE</span> of A12 rising at PPU dot 260, 268... at every 8 dots due to the sprite fetches, then at 4,8,12... on PPU background fetches. <br /><br />Now, if you have any questions, please, contact Disch. I'm not the right person for it. Sorry for the trouble.

In some place like the wiki it makes more sense to explain what rules must be followed to get IRQs to fire at 260.  We could have practically an entire wiki page devoted to when it will fire if those rules aren't followed.

It's not the mapper hardware is that complex, it's the signals that drive the mapper which are complex.  The chip must sense scanlines via signals it has available to it (mainly PPU A12, and also CPU M2 for a sense of time).  Thus one must have a strong grasp of the PPU and CPU signals and their timing to fully understand when to expect an IRQ to fire.

(How did Calima get 195?). <em>edit: Plus it takes 7 cycles to enter an IRQ (Total: 222 pixels).</em> Additionally, because this changes the <strong>scroll location</strong> instead of something with less latency (like emphasis), there's another 16-ish pixels of latency afterwards.<br /><br />Additionally, the IRQ interrupts a &quot;CMP zp; BEQ rel&quot; loop so there's up to 3 CPU cycles = 9 pixels of jitter in the resultant IRQ timing.<br /><br />If I change the 2006/5/5/6 write sequence to one that instead sets the greyscale bit at the same time as the original final 2006 write, the edge moves ≈20-12 pixels to the left, as expected.<br /><br />All emulators finally display the updated scroll somewhere around on-screen coordinate (160), meaning that the IRQ was asserted somewhere around on-screen pixel <em>(260). So, there you go: your test shows that IRQ is asserted on pixel 260, as previously stated.</em><br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">calima wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">The current wiki is wrong.
