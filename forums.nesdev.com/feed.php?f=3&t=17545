Since it is a command line based emulator, you should be able to install it with brew.<br /><br />For the wiki, if you could find the information about the macOS emulators and see on which version of the OS they can be run that would really be of great help for the wiki. This would help future users. I had the same issues when I did some programming with a Mac but since I  came from a windows background and knew about the one with debuggers, I just figured out it was faster to just run them under wine. A good native emulator for mac with a debugger would be nice to have, especially performance and UI wise.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3559">Banshaku</a> — Tue Jul 17, 2018 6:02 pm</p><hr />

I know I'm derailing this thread but my OCD is kicking in and would love to know the meaning of the code since I never had an older mac. The only thing I could found is that is top row could be code 0xF for exception and 0xD could be NMI. Did I found the right information? (sorry Davecom! If you need help with emulators I will see what I can do!).<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3559">Banshaku</a> — Tue Jul 17, 2018 1:13 am</p><hr />

Apple's naming convention nonsense (and such pedantry) can be represented by a single picture, which won't make any sense unless you're from the original Macintosh days:<br /><br />sad_mac_by_mrkoi.png<br />Looking forward to the list of emulators and their GitHub links so we can actually improve something for everyone!<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3">koitsu</a> — Tue Jul 17, 2018 12:40 am</p><hr />

I forget about that one often <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_lol.gif" alt=":lol:" title="Laughing" />  I will fix it later. I will check how to add the link for IOS one since it's a different repo.<br /><br />edit:<br /><br />I just separated the link since it will be easier that way.  As for the OS name, well, technically the older version is OS X and not it is called macOS so the author said OS X but I don't want to get into a &quot;name wars&quot; over small details <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />  The Wiki mentioned up to now OS X for the platform and people can figure out if it will work with their latest version or not. The wiki per se doesn't go into detail about the version though. <br /><br />I think the most important is that the emulator and the target platform is mentioned.  The rest, we can decide later what naming is better.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3559">Banshaku</a> — Mon Jul 16, 2018 10:57 pm</p><hr />
