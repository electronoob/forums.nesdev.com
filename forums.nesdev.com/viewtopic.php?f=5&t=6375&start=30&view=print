<br />Wow.  I just tried that one in NESICIDE and it looks great.  I'm confused though because I also tried it in Nintendulator 0.965 and the bridges don't show up.  Anyone have a video of playing track 1 on a real NES?  =]

<br />Yeah I saw some other discussion about that on here.  I had to turn off the debug window to get the game to run...
<br />
<br />Part of the reason why I decided to just allow execution of illegals and flag them with an icon in my code browser.  I need a 22x22 PNG of a bomb for the KIL opcodes.  =]

<br />Ahh that's a good idea...a STOP sign for KIL opcodes (but only when they're about to be executed though, otherwise there'd be stop-signs all over the data).  
<br />
<br />I couldn't find the 16x16 bomb... ?

<br />Are folks sure it isn't a bad dump or that there isn't a bug in the emulator that's causing it to somehow set PC to the wrong thing?  (I can think of mapper emulation bugs that might cause the wrong PRG page to be switched in and thus wrong code getting executed)

<br />
<br />Typically if the game didn't intentionally execute the undocumented opcode I would expect it to be completely inoperative -- especially if it was a bankswitch fault in the emulator!  The game seems to work fine, but there's a few scanlines at the top that are a bit mangled looking.  But, I can't say for sure because I never had it on a real NES.  That's why I was wondering if anyone has a video of it being played on a real NES or even with a PowerPak [another thing I don't have].

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I'm pretty sure I tried it on my PowerPak back when I was researching ways to hide vertical scrolling glitches, and I seem to remember it working just like in Nestopia. The gray "border" at the top is intentional, it's meant to hide vertical scrolling artifacts. It's supposed to be a steady (not shaky like in FCEUX), 20-scanlines tall border.
<br />
<br />The problem is that in order to time the height of that border the game relies on $2004 reads to detect the start of the frame, and not many emulators have such writes implemented correctly.

<br />I'm not sure where my emulator belongs... while I continue to develop it, on occasion, it's more or less complete and has been available for download for years now.  I wouldn't say it's popular, though.  Maybe there needs to be a third section to differentiate working emulators from those that are works-in-progress?

<br />
<br />It needs to go in the bottom portion of the page, along with all the other emulators.  Popular/common ones are at the top.

<br />
<br />Some NROM games look and run fine, while others (like Galaxian) look like a mess.
<br />
<br />
<br />I saw a post earlier about Super Cars.  Is there a link or list somewhere of the games that are tricky to emulate?
<br />
<br />
<br />For example, I think Galaxian is tricky for a number of reasons, but at least one reason is that it uses a vertical scroll value of 255 (which I think acts like a negative scroll). 
<br />
<br />I like the idea of indicating NROM games that have quirks since that allows emulator writers to avoid mapper compliance until they are sure other important aspects are working.
