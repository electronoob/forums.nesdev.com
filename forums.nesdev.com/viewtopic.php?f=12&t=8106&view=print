Even if you used the SPC to communicate with the SCPU to feed it some sort of calculations it would be faster to do it on the SCPU. The only thing I could think of you might consider is using the SPC to hide some sort of copy protection code where you process encrypted data in the SPC to try to hide it from less involved hackers or something.
<br />
<br />The SPC really is just meant for playing music and sound effects. It's clocked too slow and has too slow of communication with the SCPU to be useful for anything else.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I guess the SPC have MUL and DIV instructions the 65816 lacks... so if you're going to do something like large matrix multiply, the SPC might be faster at it even if it's clocked at only 1.024 MHz
<br />However, the problem will be the delay to transfer the order to the SPC to do the calculation and the dalay to transfer result back to the CPU, where BOTH the CPU and SPC have to be busy, which would without a doubt make it slower overall than doing everything in the CPU.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Personally, I don't see the point in doing anything other than sound with it. I suppose that when music is playing, you can't have the SPC700 do anything else or it would screw up the sound, which means that any help it could provide would have to be during loading sequences and such. The SNES is not a console that suffers from long loading sequences, so improving those by a little bit would hardly justify the trouble.

<br />In fact some games such as Chrono Trigger DOES have noticeable loading times when the CPU has to transfer data to the SPC.

<br />Ironically enough, if there's one thing the SPC can't help you with, this is it!
