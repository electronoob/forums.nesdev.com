		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />No, because Mapper 36 does not connect Pin 22 to any PRG or CHR pins, but Mapper 173 does, and I'm still insisting that Pin 22 is operated by $4101. Basically, the way I think it works (and the only way that emulation works) is like this: Writing anything to $8000-$FFFF not only copies the internal register bits (originally from pins 6/8-12) to the output pins (1-3, 23, 24), but also copies the inverse of the $4101 state to Pin 22. Note that I do not expect that writing to $4101 alone without being followed by the usual $4103/$4101/$8000 sequence will have any effect. Because Pin 22 is not connected to anything on Mapper 36, you will not be able to see the effect from hot-plugging alone without connecting something, either a LED or a voltmeter, to Pin 22.<br /><br />To get 8 KiB CHR bank 0 in Mapper 173, you must write: $FF to $4101 and $x1 (AND $01) to $4102 (and then the usual rest).<br />To get 8 KiB CHR bank 1 in Mapper 173, you must write: $FF to $4101 and $x0 (AND $01) to $4102 (and then the usual rest).<br />To get 8 KiB CHR bank 2 in Mapper 173, you must write: $00 to $4101 and $x0 (AND $01) to $4102 (and then the usual rest).<br />To get 8 KiB CHR bank 3 in Mapper 173, you must write: $00 to $4101 and $x1 (AND $01) to $4102 (and then the usual rest).<br />The other bits in $4102 are only relevant for the game reading back from $4100 and checking its value. You can see it yourself in the Mapper 173 dump of <em>Puzzle</em> from PC $E6F5 on (which also does three increments, so it'll be a bit more complicated). Here's the equivalent Kazzo script, also with three increments since it was just copied after the game's code:<div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">function ppu_dump(d, pagesize, banksize)<br />{<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;for(local i = 0; i &lt; pagesize; i++){<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;local xorvalue = ((i &gt;&gt; 1) &amp; 1) * 0xFF) ^ 0xFF;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;cpu_write(d, 0x4101, xorvalue);<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;local written = (((i &amp; 7) - 3) &amp; 7) | (i &amp; 8);<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;cpu_write(d, 0x4102, written ^ xorvalue);<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;cpu_write(d, 0x4103, 0);<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;cpu_write(d, 0x4100, 0);<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;cpu_write(d, 0x4103, 0xFF);<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;cpu_write(d, 0x4100, 0xFF);<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;cpu_write(d, 0x4100, 0xFF);<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;cpu_write(d, 0x4100, 0xFF);<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;cpu_write(d, 0x80EF, 0xFF);<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;ppu_read(d, 0, banksize);<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;}<br />}</div>

The snipped you quoted, if correct, would say in terms of chip pins (and with my new understanding that there are really six bits plus one carry bit, even if Mapper 173 only connects four of them):<ol style="list-style-type: decimal"><li>Writing to $4101 changes Invert to Pin 12's value.</li><li>When $4100 is written to and Mode is 0, the value previously written to $4102, being the triplet from Pin 10-12 and the triplet from Pin 6/8/9, is copied into Register. If Invert is active, the triplet from Pin 10-12 is inverted during copying, while the triplet from Pin 6/8/9 is not inverted.</li><li>When $4100 is read from, the two triplets from Register are copied to Pin 6/8/9 and Pin 10-12. If Invert is active, the triplet copied to Pin 6/8/9 is inverted during copying while the triplet copied to Pin 10-12 is not inverted.</li><li>When $8000 is written to, Register is copied to Output, and Pin 22 goes high if Invert is inactive and low if Invert is active.</li></ol>The basic hypthesis here is that $4101 inverts one triplet during writing only and the other triplet during reading only.<br /><br />On Mapper 36, since only two bits of the Pin 10-12 triplet and none of the bits of the Pin 6/8/9 triplet are connected, writing a value to $4102+$4100 with Invert <em>inactive</em>, then activating Invert, then reading via $4100 will return the same value because reading $4100 only inverts the non-connected triplet. Writing a value to $4102+$4100 with Invert <em>active</em> and reading it back via $4100 should however invert it. This is something you can test without clips.

The experiment also nicely shows that only Pin 12 is relevant during the $4101 write. As for $4101 inverting the 6/8/9 triplet while reading from $4100, as I hypothesized, you will not be able to test this with a Mapper 36 board without using clips, as these pins are not connected to the CPU data bus.
