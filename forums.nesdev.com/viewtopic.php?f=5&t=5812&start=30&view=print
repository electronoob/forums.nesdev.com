We currently have 5-6 people on average there; The more people we have helping us test things as we go along -- and giving suggestions, the better this program will be when its done. We support all 3 platforms (and it most likely works on several other platforms too) so pretty much anyone with a PC can help us test.
<br />
<br />I plan on building the first beta installers for mac, win, and (packages for) linux on xmas eve, and releasing it first thing on xmas day.

Most of the text you see in the debugger output is just informational while I write the assembler, and will be removed once the assembler is done (I have to see what it's doing right now :p). It already supports line number reporting of syntax errors, detection of labels, as well as opcode compilation for a few parameter types. Hopefully I'll be able to finish up the basic assembler support soon.
<br />
<br />Lastly..  I plan on making the macro system work like NASM's macro system. I think that will add great flexibility and power to your code.

<br />I believe he meant something like this: meta-sprites and animations. This is as hard to implement as a level editor though, because every programmer uses their own format.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Every word processor had its own format for rich text until everyone standardized on interchange formats: RTF, HTML, then ODF. Likewise, every image editor had its own format for bitmaps until everyone standardized on interchange formats: BMP, then PNG. And every digital camera had its own protocol for connecting to a PC until USB came around and cameras pretended to be hard drives.
<br />
<br />Ideally, everyone could standardize on some common format for a display list, and NESICIDE could edit this format. Then anyone wanting a more compact format could write something in Python or C++ or VB to convert it. Likewise, developers of CHR RAM games standardized on a format identical to CHR ROM for storage of tiles in PRG ROM, although some used a more compact representation such as RLE (e.g. Contra), 1bpp (e.g. the font in Jeopardy!), or a more sophisticated codec (e.g. Bee 52).

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />But like Hamtaro said, it would make the process faster when the programmer doesn't already have their own format.  And if the editor and format is good enough, it may even be tempting to switch over to it unless you've already created a ton of data otherwise (which most of us haven't, I'm sure).
<br />
<br />I'd considered coding an animation displayer thing, but was still planning on writing the frames out by hand (well, and using macros when appropriate).

<br />
<br />So you would like something like a canvas to place sprite tiles onto and move around at-will until you get it "just right" and then the ability to click a button and have it gen a sprite list for you fit for blasting into OAM?  If I understand you correctly, then this type of thing is indeed on my list of features.  I would also like it to be able to animate so you can test sprite movements without having to code them!  Then a 'tutorial' might take such a list of sprite data and 'play' your sprite for you on the emulator with code.
