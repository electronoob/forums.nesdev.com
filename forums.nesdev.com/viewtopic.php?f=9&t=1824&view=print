		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Hi all. I'm kinda new to this whole thing so please excuse my ignorance. I have a hack of SMB that I would like to burn on a cartridge. I'm having a hard time getting it onto a cart though. I purchased an EPROM burner and some 27C256 ROMS:
<br />
<br /><a href="http://jameco.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/ProductDisplay?langId=-1&amp;storeId=10001&amp;catalogId=10001&amp;productId=225947" class="postlink">THE BURNER: Flash Writer/Programmer With USB Interface</a>
<br />
<br /><a href="http://jameco.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/ProductDisplay?langId=-1&amp;storeId=10001&amp;catalogId=10001&amp;productId=39714&amp;pa=39714PS" class="postlink">THE ROMS: 27C256</a>
<br />
<br />I went down to the local game exchange shop and got some Mapper 0 carts NES NROM256-02 (i think it was golf or baseball) and an NES NROM128-01 cart. I took off the CHR and PRG chips, put in a socket (i bought this socket: <a href="http://jameco.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/ProductDisplay?langId=-1&amp;storeId=10001&amp;catalogId=10001&amp;productId=526256" class="postlink">SOCKET</a>) and I burned some of the 27C256 roms, put them into the socket and now i'm getting a gray screen. So really i'm going back and i'm trying to figure out where I went wrong - I think it is the way i've burned the 27C256 ROMS. My questions are:
<br />
<br />1) The CHR and PRG files are much less than 32k (27C256 rom). I was reading that the CHR and PRG file may need to be burned multiple times on the ROM so they equal 32k (ie CHR 8k x 4 = 32k). If this is the case, what would be the best way to accomplish this. I'm on a MacBook (Tiger 10.4) but could do this in windows if it's easier.
<br />
<br />2) Can I put SMB hack onto an NROM128 cart? 
<br />
<br />Also, are there any other recommendations or from the steps above does it look like i'm doing something wrong.
<br />
<br />BTW - I really started getting into this because of an artist that taught a class on new media art at my college. If anyone hasn't heard of him, definitely check out his site - he is doing some great work:

The CHR is 8KB, so you should repeat it 4 times. You could use an hex editor for these things, but I usually use the Windows/DOS prompt for this (the command COPY /B SMB.CHR + SMB.CHR + SMB.CHR + SMB.CHR SMB32.CHR will do it).<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">2) Can I put SMB hack onto an NROM128 cart?</div><br />No, the "128" part tells you it can only handle 16KB. You could probably modify it to handle 32KB, but I wouldn't know exactly how.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">Also, are there any other recommendations or from the steps above does it look like i'm doing something wrong.</div>
<br />You should get a multimeter and check every pin to make sure you soldered the socket in right. You know, it's a lot of pins, and it's easy to end up with bad contact or short circuit some of them.
<br />
<br />I can get paranoid sometimes, so also usually check the whole circuit. With the chip in the socket, I check the contact from each leg all the way to the respective pin on the board (you know, the bottom part that plugs into the console - use the cart pinout guide to know wich pins are wich) to make absolute sure that there are no bad contacts.
<br />
<br />If the contacs are OK but you still get a grey screen, you're probably programming the chip wrong. Doesn't your programmer have a function for reading the chip back? That will clear things up.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />OK, I have used this cart before, and this is the deal. If you use 27C256 chips you have to fill the entire chip with data. Yup, the entire thing. Use a hex editor and multiply the file size until you get 256 KB. I had to do this too, I know it kinda sucks and it takes a lot of time until you get used to your hex editor. Kinda makes you wonder if the chip is overkill... just kidding. I use a freeware hex editor called Cygnus for PC and it works pretty good for stripping off headers, splitting files, and multiplying file sizes to fit the chips. Actually, I did have an interesting idea the other day. I am going to multiply my NROM games to 128 KB and then put two of them on the cartridge. I then will take the most significant byte of the EPROM chips and wire up a switch to pull it high or low, and I can have two banks for two games, 128 KB each. ('cuz 128 +128 = 256) When I want to change games I can pull out the cart and turn the switch to the other position, and viola! Another game! If I like it and it works I may even take the second most significant bit and make four banks of 64 KB each and then I could have 4 NROM games! <img src="./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" />

<br />
<br />The 256 is kilobits, which is 32kbytes.  A 256kbyte EPROM is 27C020.
