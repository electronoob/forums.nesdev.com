Item #6 is about witch stereotypes, and it mostly retreads an article by Jane Peyton in <em>Stylist</em> titled &quot;<a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/life/recipes/women-and-beer-a-snap-shot-history/38993" class="postlink">Women and beer: a pocket history</a>&quot;.<br /><br />In medieval Europe, drinking water was of poor quality. So while the men were out doing other things, the women would brew beer to drink. This needs a big black kettle, a cat to scare away vermin, a wooden pole with twigs at the end to denote &quot;beer served here&quot; in an era of illiteracy, and occasionally a tall hat to be seen in the crowd when selling the product. The surname <a href="https://surnames.behindthename.com/name/brewster" class="postlink">Brewster</a> originally meant &quot;woman who makes beer&quot;.<br /><br />But in the 14th century, men wanted in on the alcohol market. So they got all sexist, reinterpreting the signs of a brewer as signs of witchcraft.

I suppose this is old folk humor. I don't know if the broomstick version of flying is as old as these accusations of witchcraft or if it's maybe a victorian revision of the stories that takes a common description and layers it on top of another.

And then all you did was posting some article about beer brewery, a topic that, I bet, you have zero interest in. Just for the sake of a stupid pun that isn't really that funny to begin with.<br /><br />And I called you out on this behavior. Because this method is worthy of some corporate advertisement assholes or 13 year old YouTube morons.<br />Your thread is the NESDev equivalent of some YouTube video with a misleading thumbnail. This kind of crap is universally hated. Why should you be an exception to this?<br /><br />Next time, I'll simply answer every thread that you create with the word &quot;First&quot;. Another generally-hated spam behavior. Let's see how long <em>this</em> will be tolerated.<br /><br />And who the fuck is Star Evil?
