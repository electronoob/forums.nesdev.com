<br />I used the information from the nerdy nights rom: 
<br />
<br />if ballx &lt;paddle1
<br />if bally &gt; paddley top
<br />if bally &lt; paddley bottum
<br />bounce,ball now moving left
<br />
<br />So with the information from the rom i made this:
<br />
<br />checkpaddlecollision
<br />lda ballx
<br />com paddlex
<br />beq paddlerange 
<br />
<br />; compaire the ballx with the paddlex constant
<br />
<br />
<br />paddlerange:
<br />lda bally
<br />com paddleytop
<br />bcc paddlerangedone
<br />lda #$00
<br />sta ballright
<br />lda #$01
<br />sta ballleft
<br />paddlerangedone:
<br />
<br />
<br />I added 3 other variables(for a 4 sprites paddle) and it works but not ok.
<br />The paddle bounces BUT only if the ball makes it,sometimes it bounces half way the screen depending of the position of the paddle.
<br />
<br />Did i something wrong or is this a bad collision method?

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" /><span style="font-size: 200%; line-height: normal">APOLOGIES TO LOG IN FOR THE (NOW FIXED) BAD EXPLANATION</span>
<br />
<br />First off, is this pseudo code?
<br />
<br />I'm never seen com, only cmp.
<br />
<br />Second off, what you've described in the if statements is more or less how you do it, except your check for X should be &gt; not &lt;.
<br />
<br />This is what happens when it's ballx &lt; paddlex.
<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">| = Paddle<br />* = ball<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;|&nbsp; &nbsp; <br />*&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; |&nbsp; &nbsp; <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;|<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; <br />The ball's x position is less than the paddle's x position<br />The ball's y position is greater than the paddle's top y position<br />The ball's y position is less than the paddle's bottom y position<br /><br />So the ball bounces left even though the ball is nowhere near the paddle.<br /></div><br /><br />Something similar would happen with the reversed condition with the ball on the right, so it might be worth doing two x checks as well if you don't want the player to hit the ball after it has already passed the paddle on the right.<br /><br />That said, your actual 6502 code is not doing the checks you laid out at all. See comments.<br /><br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">checkpaddlecollision<br />lda ballx<br />cmp paddlex<br />beq paddlerange;If ball's x position is equal to paddle's x position branch to paddlerange<br /><br />; You're not skipping anything here. You branch to paddlerange<br />;But if you didn't branch the except same<br />;thing would happen because no code is in between the branch<br />;and the label.<br /><br />;Did you mean bcc instead of beq, since you<br />;want to do the y check only if the ball's x position is to the right of the paddle?<br /><br />;Did you mean to branch to paddlerangedone, which would skip<br />;the y collision check so a bounce can't occur in the case?<br />paddlerange:<br />lda bally<br />cmp paddleytop<br />bcc paddlerangedone;if ball y &lt; paddleytop branch to paddlerangedone<br /><br />;You also need to do the second y check you described in the if statement, or the ball will bounce whenever the ball is below the paddle's top. <br />;Even if it's also below the paddle's bottom.<br />lda #$00;Do this stuff;<br />sta ballright;<br />lda #$01<br />sta ballleft<br />paddlerangedone: <br /></div><br /><br />So basically, your current code doesn't check X at all. It bounces the ball whenever the ball's position is greater than or equal to the paddle's top. Meaning this is a hit:<br /><br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; |<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; |<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; |<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; *<br /></div><br /><br />So is this:<br /><br /><br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; |<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; |<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; |<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; <br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; <br />*<br /></div><br /><br />Here is how the flags are set after a compare:<br /><br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; +-------------------------+---------------------+<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; |&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;|&nbsp; N&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Z&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;C&nbsp; |<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; +-------------------------+---------------------+<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; | A, X, or Y&nbsp; &lt;&nbsp; Memory&nbsp; &nbsp;|&nbsp; 1&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;0&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;0&nbsp; |<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; | A, X, or Y&nbsp; =&nbsp; Memory&nbsp; &nbsp;|&nbsp; 0&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;1&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;1&nbsp; |<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; | A, X, or Y&nbsp; &gt;&nbsp; Memory&nbsp; &nbsp;|&nbsp; 0&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;0&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;1&nbsp; |<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; +-----------------------------------------------+<br /></div><br /><br />You have to do the checks you described (with my fix for X), and branch passed the ball bounce code any time one of them isn't true. That way if all of them are true, the ball will bounce.<br /><br />Edit: For those curious about my error, I said log in's y branch was wrong when it is not. I also suggested changing his x beq to bcs when it should be bcc. I always get confused when mixing if statements with assembly because<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">if&#40;whatever == whatever&#41;&#123;;If equal run the code below<br />//code<br />&#125;<br /></div><br />but<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">lda whatever<br />cmp whatever<br />beq label;If equal skip the code below<br />;code<br /><br />label:<br /></div>
<br />That's really no excuse, though. Sorry, log in.
<br />
<br />You just need to fix the x branch and add the second y check, not reverse the condition of the existing y check <em>and</em> add a y check.

<br />BUT..help would be nice.
<br />
<br />Before i saw the fixed post. I Changed my code a couple of times and now im 100% lost.
<br />
<br />I got some spare time and im working on my code again.
<br />
<br />my code.
<br />
<br />checkpaddlecollision
<br />LDA ballx
<br />CMP (typo i did not mean COM)padllex
<br />BCC paddlerange
<br />
<br />
<br />paddlerange:
<br />LDA bally
<br />CMP paddley
<br />BCC paddlerangedone
<br />
<br />Im pretty sure this is ok,
<br />But my second check is wrong i think.
<br />
<br />LDA bally
<br />CMP paddle14 (the 4th sprite and bottom sprite of the 4)
<br />BCC paddlerangedone (or should this be BCS?
<br />
<br />LDA #$00
<br />STA ballright
<br />LDA #$01
<br />STA ballleft
<br />paddlerangedone:
<br />
<br />Is the mistake here or from other things i changed in my code?

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I realize I wrote a lot (and made an error at first) , but that post describes what needs to be done. You've still got a branch that doesn't branch over anything. 
<br />
<br />When an instruction is run, various flags are set. I posted how cmp sets the flags in my last post. The branch commands skip all the code between the branch and the label if the branch condition is true. (So bcc whatever will go directly to the label whatever if the carry flag is clear. Otherwise, the program will run the first instruction below the branch instruction and go from there. )
<br />
<br />So this: 
<br />
<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">&nbsp;<br />BCC paddlerange;If this instruction wasn't here, the program would run exactly the same<br /><br />;because there is nothing here to skip. <br />paddlerange: ;If we branch to this label, or if we don't branch, the same code is run.<br /><br /></div>
<br />
<br />isn't doing what it needs to. Your goal is to branch passed the y checks entirely if the X check fails, because if the X check fails there's no collision.
<br />
<br />Your first y check uses bcc to branch if bally &lt; paddley. So it doesn't make sense to use bcc again to branch if bally &gt;= paddley's bottom. You'd want the reverse condition (bcs), or you're branching if bally &lt; paddley's bottom instead of branching when bally &gt;= paddley's bottom.

<br />But my code is stil buggy.Sorry to be a pain.
<br />But i fixed my code 2 times and  bugs keeps popping up.
<br />
<br />First i added a second y check with bcs so i have the first with bcc and the second with bcs.Tried the code and it kind of worked.
<br />It just bounced way before the paddle sometimes.
<br />But i still needed to change the x check.
<br />
<br />I needed to get x check branced passed the y check if it failed.
<br />so i did this{
<br />
<br />checkpaddlecollision
<br />lda ballx
<br />cmp paddlex
<br />bcc paddlerange
<br />jmp nohit
<br />
<br />go on with my code and added nohit at the end so if thex collision fails the program goes to nohit and rts and all should be fine but now there is no collision at all??
<br />What am i doing wrong ?This should work 100%

<br />1. What <em>exactly</em> is this code doing? If you don't really know, it may help to write a complete run down.
<br />2. What <em>exactly</em> does it need to do? 
<br />
<br />By answering these two questions, you should be able to figure out what's wrong by the thing in the first answer that doesn't match the second answer.
<br />
<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">checkpaddlecollision<br />lda ballx<br />cmp paddlex<br />bcc paddlerange<br />jmp nohit<br />paddlerange:;I assume paddlerange is still here?<br /></div><br /><br />This is a run down of exactly what your code is doing:<br /><br />lda ballx.; The accumulator has the ball's x position.<br />cmp paddlex.; This will clear the carry flag if what's in the accumulator (currently ballx) &lt; paddlex, or set the carry flag if the accumulator &gt;= paddlex<br />bcc paddlerange; This will jmp to paddlerange is the carry flag is clear. So by extension of the logic of the last line, it will jmp to paddlerange if ballx &lt; paddlex.<br />jmp nohit; This will jmp to nohit. Because of the branch behind it, it will only do so when ballx &gt;= paddlex. (i.e. that the carry is set)<br /><br />The problem you are having with this exact sequence of events is that the ball bounces way before the paddle. It's doing this because your x branch is wrong. What happens when the X branch is wrong?<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">Kasumi wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"><br />This is what happens when it's ballx &lt; paddlex.<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">| = Paddle<br />* = ball<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;|&nbsp; &nbsp; <br />*&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; |&nbsp; &nbsp; <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;|<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; <br />The ball's x position is less than the paddle's x position<br />The ball's y position is greater than the paddle's top y position<br />The ball's y position is less than the paddle's bottom y position<br /></div><br /></div>

That's how the flags will be set after a cmp. You can branch to a label if one of these is set or clear. <br /><br />Say you have code that makes a character jump. You branch passed that code when the jump button is NOT pressed, since that is when you DON'T want it to run.<br /><br />Here, we're going to branch passed the bounce code when the collision CAN'T have occurred. Got it?<br /><br />So here's exactly what you need.<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">;Untested, but should work<br />lda ballx<br />cmp paddlex<br />bcc skipballbounceleft;If ballx &lt; paddlex, go to skipballbounceleft<br />;We didn't skip.

So bally must be &lt; paddlebottom<br />;As well, ballx &gt;= paddlex<br />;As well, bally &gt;= paddley.<br />;All the conditions for bouncing are true.

There's no point copying the code if you don't understand it. <br /><br />Now, one other thing you may not realize: ballx (if my assumptions of what you've written so far are correct) is the top left corner of the ball. paddlex is the top left corner of the paddle. So the ball will only bounce when it's top left point is passed the paddle with this code.<br /><br />The same for y. It's possible for the ball to be inside the paddle and still miss a collision in a case like this:<br /><br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">0= ball<br />1 = paddle<br />2 = both<br /><br />00<br />021<br />&nbsp;11<br />&nbsp;11<br />&nbsp;11<br /></div>
<br />
<br />So keep that in mind before thinking it's not working. This should still work most of the time, though. (assuming I didn't make another error  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_redface.gif" alt=":oops:" title="Embarassed" /> )
<br />
<br />If it does work, and you understand it, fixing the missed collisions like the above will be the next step.

<br />Just wanted to second this. Never, ever, ever "guess" code. All that happens when you do this is you end up with something that might blow up in your face in the future, even if it all appears to work well at first. If you don't understand why a piece of code is working, it will most likely fail eventually, when run under other circumstances.

<br />
<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">lda #$01<br />sta ballright<br />lda #$00<br />sta ballleft <br /></div><br /><br />This code has always been for a ball bouncing left off a paddle on the right. That's what you said in your first post. That's why the bounce code  that you first posted, and what I have always posted is this:<br /><br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">lda #$00<br />sta ballright<br />lda #$01<br />sta ballleft <br /></div><br /><br />The collision detection code we've worked with so far will only work for the ball bouncing left off a paddle on the right. <br /><br />And while it probably wouldn't affect this specifically, here is another odd thing about your code:<br /><br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">Skip:<br /><br />jmp gameengindone<br />rts <br /></div>
<br />
<br />Because that jmp is directly before the rts, the rts will never be executed. If what you've posted is a subroutine, that means your stack is probably corrupt.

<br />
<br />I finally did actually test that collision code and it gives the results I expect from it, so it is probably not that. 
<br />
<br />One other question: Are you retyping the code for the forum? Because you can just copy and paste it from your actual file so I see what you see.

<br />  ;;if ball x &lt; paddle1x
<br />  ;;  if ball y &gt; paddle y top
<br />  ;;    if ball y &lt; paddle y bottom
<br />  ;;      bounce, ball now moving left
