<br />the only thing i can think of to improve it would be to give examples of buffer loading routines, but i'm sure there's plenty of those about <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />

<br />
<br />Oh and when you take the example of the frame being one hour, it'd make it even more sense if you make it being one day. The NMI is your alarm clock, and VBlank is your breakfast time. You have to not make it too long because you have to go to work (that is the work you have to do for the game engine on one frame). When finished, you go back home and sleep until next frame. Also this could explain slowdowns : If you have so much work to do that you haven't finished on morning, your alarm clock would still ring, and you should still take a breakfast, and after that you will return to your work (not begin another). When done you'd be so tired that you'd go immediately to bed (even if it's not night yet) and wait until next morning. Eventually, it can explain what happens when you read $2002, it just acknownledges the alarm clock. If you are constantly fetching it all the night you may not occasionally hear when it rings.
<br />That makes sense in my opinion, but it's free of you to use it or not if you are making another version (the 1 frame = 1 hour example is good enough anyway).
<br />
<br />This doc should be uploaded on romhacking.net (if it's not already done).

I'm thinking of doing a doc series in the same vein as the <a href="http://www.parashift.com/c++-faq-lite/index.html" class="postlink">C++ FAQ LITE</a>, but for nesdev.  You can sort of tell I even drifted into that style midway through the doc (the topics start turning into questions)
<br />
<br />Anyway glad you guys liked it.  I'll probably redraft this and organize it better.  This actually started as a .txt document and then I quickly converted to html (which is why there's some oddities -- like **emphasis** instead of <em>emphasis</em>)

<br />Great then.  I will be more than happy to mention the source since I think that even thought were fighting right now for the license for the content, mentioning who made it doesn't hurt (my stance on the matter).  I think it's important to at least mention the people that did the effort to offer such nice content in the first place.
<br />
<br />I'm reading it at the moment while working, eh, I mean "while taking my break at work" (Of course boss! I'm studying some "new" design pattern <img src="./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" />) and I like it.  I like the example of data structure for the buffer (even thought we don't have to use them like you mentioned) since as a new programmer for the platform, you don't know yet how to do things unless you see those sample and try it for yourself after or have experience for a similar platform/way of programming.  This make me things differently on how to do things and I like it.  I never saw a "how to" like that for the nes before and this is great news.
<br />
<br />Good work!

<br />I guess <a href="http://jonathan.microclub.ch/NES_raster/nes_raster.txt" class="postlink">what I wrote about raster effects</a> could be a chapter (<a href="http://jonathan.microclub.ch/NES_raster/index.html" class="postlink">html</a> version with demoes).
<br />
<br />Other chapters should incude about hardware, PPU fetches, cart types, etc... Probably basic algorithm about how to make a game, collision detection, how to encode maps, basic compression suff.
