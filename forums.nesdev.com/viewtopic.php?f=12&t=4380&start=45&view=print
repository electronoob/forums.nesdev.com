You need to connect two of them as I said, in HiROM fashion and the final one in LoROM fashion (skipping A15 on the socket). If you wired all 3 roms address lines exactly the same/all together then it won't work properly. Perhaps all that was wrong was you connected the upper address lines on ROM 3 incorrectly (non LoROM fashion).

That's all it was, just the 3rd rom was wired as Hirom instead of Lorom.  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_redface.gif" alt=":oops:" title="Embarassed" /> <br /><br />Thanks for pointing out that obvious step to me Mott!<br /><br />Just one last question about this, and this is probably aimed more at shadowkn55. It's been mentioned on here a few times that the SNES can only access about ~95Mbit of data, so being that this game is 96Mbit, will there be issues with it crashing or glitching later on? Has anyone played it on an actual cart long enough to see?<br /><br />EDIT: I just re-read a pm I got from Shadowkn55 a few months ago, and he stated that he did indeed play the game through to the end, and it worked. He did mention a couple times where the cart crashed, but he figured it was due to power consumption issues, as he said the cart never crashed twice in the same place. To avoid this, I'm going to run thicker VCC and GND wires to my roms and see if that takes care of it. The other thing might be adding some caps to take care of potential noise.

It doesn't use a MAD-1 at all.

Subtracting areas reserved for the console (banks $7E and $7F and the first half of $00-$3F and $80-$BF) leaves 95 Mbit. For anything bigger than that, you'll need a Real Mapper of some sort.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />My post was in reference to a 128Mbit game that didn't have any co-processors as Tepples brought up.  Exotic SNES carts (non Hi/Lo ROM) often have co-processors in comparison to the NES's 'memory mappers'.  See <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Super_NES_enhancement_chips" class="postlink">wiki</a>  if you've got one of those my statement is null and void.  I'm not certain, but I'd guess that over 95% of SNES games don't have any special chip/co-processor and  are just plain rom uniquely mapped to the SNES memory space (don't forget all important mirroring though) via an address decoder such as the MAD.

But as Tepples pointed out you'll never be able to see all that 128Mbit worth at one time.  By banking it's possible to use it all though.  My main motive was for stuffing a bunch of games on there for a multicart via reset toggling, but a select register could be implemented as well similar to NES memory mappers.  That and it didn't cost anything in regards to the design once two flash chips were draw out aside from a CPLD pin which was already available.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">Is there a way to see at runtime if a genuine infinitelives repro board is in use?</div>  It depends on how I configured it I suppose.  With some games you actually need to be undetectable to run (SRAM size and mirroring mostly).  I'm about to publish exactly how things are configured on all the different 'standard' size choices.  So verifing that config would be possible.  Probably closer to you goal though would be to read the device ID off of the flash chips.  Granted using the same flash chips would get around that, but the memories I use are not compatible with typical TSOP to DIP adapters because they're 48 pin TSOP's.  But that doesn't stop one from making one that would work.  There is other trickery that could be inserted into the CPLD as well I suppose, but not likely to be done on my production boards.
