<br />
<br />1. What are the small surface mount parts (E$3, E$5, E$6) supposed to be? I'm assuming decoupling capacitors, like 0.1uF caps, but any info would be helpful. 
<br />2. I assume the solder jumper is for hirom/lorom selection. Is that correct, and if so, which is which?
<br />
<br />Peccost, would you be willing to share the eagle files for your willem adapter? I'd like to get one of those made as well.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Here are some news about that willem adaptor!!
<br />I'm waiting the confirmation of a friend to say if it's well designed though...
<br />
<br />This week I managed to solder the flash memory on my board.
<br />When I checked if it was empty I realized it was not!!
<br />The blank test worked!!
<br />Then I tried erasing it...and it worked!!
<br />The programming was very long but no error code showed.
<br />Good news I think my adapter is good!
<br />
<br />Toodles -&gt; The three  smd parts are 0603 resistor of 10 ohms each
<br />            -&gt; Honestly I don't know the purpose of the solder jumper
<br />            -&gt; For the files (see schematic and board on page 4) eagle is not  hard to learn

<br />- No, they aren't. Pad size is 1005, but they're meant as solder jumpers. You can use resistors if you like, but they aren't needed. 
<br />-I'm working on that. 
<br />-That isn't what I asked. I know how to use EAGLE, but reinventing the wheel is time that could be better spent elsewhere.
<br />
<br />(based on board posted up by darknezz19)
<br />Left most solder jumper connects _RP to VCC. _RP is for reset if pulled low or temporary unprotect is pulled to Vid, about 12v or so depending on flash. Pulling it to VCC should keep the chip from resetting or unprotecting, so I think this jumper can be replaced with one that is by default connected, like part SOLDERJUMPERTRACE in the Sparkfun library. 
<br />
<br />Jumper immediately to the right of the flash is pretty slick. It connects _W to pin 36 of the DIP. On a SNES cartridge, this would connect it to VCC, making sure no writes are ever enabled, but gives a dedicated pin to the programmer to control the 'not write enable' pin. Another one that most likely be replaced by a default connected solder jumper, or just wired straight to the pin. (To whomever did that, great idea.) I kind of think that a solder jumper connecting _W to VCC from DIP pin 34 could be useful when used in carts that don't have the extra four holes, similar to when you'd want to use the three way jumper. 
<br />
<br />Smaller jumper in lower right connects GND to the center pad of the three way jumper. This one is definitely not needed, and replaced with just a normal trace between GND and the center pad of the three way. 
<br />
<br />Three way solder jumper connects A21 and/or A20 to the center pad, which is GND. Only use I can think of is to keep those pins from floating when put into carts that dont have DIP pins 1 or 2 connected to anything. This should definitely stay.
<br />
<br />I'll get the board relaid out with a proper .sch and .brd with good labelling, and then work on the willem adapter.
