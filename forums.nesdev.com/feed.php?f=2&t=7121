In fact it's true both loopy's doc and my doc overcomplicate the thing.<br /><br />All you have to know is that $2005 affect the scroll and that $2006 affect the adress. However, $2005/2 doesn't work during rendering (only $2005/1 takes effect).<br />When you affect the adress during rendering, it will take effect and the next tiles will be fetched at the specified location effectively "affecting" the scrolling  (also it's ORed with $2000, preventing it to fetch from pattern tables).<br /><br />However you can't deal with fine scrolls that way, therefore the need to mix $2005 and $2006 writes if you want to deal with fine scroll (which is absolutely not requirede if you DON'T deal with fine scrolls, which people seems not to understand by looping at loopy's docs.).<br /><br />I guess I just summed all just above without any complex diagrams. I'll probably have to edit my doc to make it simpler to understand for newcomers.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=38">Bregalad</a> — Sun Nov 07, 2010 5:00 am</p><hr />

The problem with Loopy's document and your summary is that they use a special language for representing the effects, but don't define that language. A while back I translated that into a <a href="http://blargg.parodius.com/info/nes_scrolling.txt" class="postlink">form more readable to myself</a>. It defines the language used, the state, and the effect of actions.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=17">blargg</a> — Sat Nov 06, 2010 2:20 pm</p><hr />

I think the top status bar scrolling demo is a bad example, since it is moving sprite 0 around.  You can scroll to any arbitrary fine X and Y value by using a 2006 write, two 2005 writes, and a 2006 write.  Only the first 2005 write and the last 2006 write will have visible effects, so try to make the last 2006 write happen before hblank ends.<br /><br /><br />So to do a scroll to an arbitrary position during rendering...<br />* Write anything with the correct name table bits to 2006.  All other bits are overwritten later.<br />* Write the Y coordinate to 2005.  Three lowest bits of Coarse Y are overwritten later.<br />* Write anything with the correct fine X to 2005.  All bits of Coarse X are overwritten later.<br />* Write Coarse X (X &gt;&gt; 3) | Coarse Y (Y and #$38, &lt;&lt; 2) to 2006.<br /><br />Also, here's my reformatted version of Loopy's document.<br /><br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">&quot;N&quot; = nametable, &quot;X&quot; = coarse X, &quot;Y&quot; = coarse Y, &quot;y&quot; = fine y, &quot;d&quot; = written data<br />           Fine Y<br />              Nametable Y,X<br />                Coarse Y<br />                     Coarse X<br />          <br />          .yyyNNYYYYYXXXXX<br /><br />2000 write:<br />        t:....NN..........=d:......xx<br />2005 first write:<br />        t:...........XXXXX=d:xxxxx...<br />        x=d:.....xxx  &#40;fine X&#41;<br />2005 second write:<br />        t:......YYYYY.....=d:xxxxx...<br />        t:.yyy............=d:.....xxx<br />2006 first write:<br />        t:..yyNNYY........=d:..xxxxxx<br />        t:.y..............=0<br />2006 second write:<br />        t:........YYYXXXXX=d:xxxxxxxx<br />        v=t<br />scanline start &#40;if background and sprites are enabled&#41;:<br />        v:.....N.....XXXXX=t:.....N.....XXXXX<br />frame start &#40;line 0, ppu clock 304&#41; &#40;if background and sprites are enabled&#41;:<br />        v=t<br /></div><p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=53">Dwedit</a> — Sat Nov 06, 2010 1:09 pm</p><hr />

To be honnest I never ever understood loopy's doc, and probably never will. Nevertheless, scrolling with $2005 and even "tricky" $2006 midframe is really simpler than it sounds as long as you're not trying to do something mid-scanline or anything. If you want to deal with midframe scrolling changes, I tried to make a "simpler" explaination <a href="http://jonathan.microclub.ch/NES_raster/index.html" class="postlink">here</a> (along with a lot of other stuff), but I don't know how simpler it is in the eyes of a newbies.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=38">Bregalad</a> — Sat Nov 06, 2010 11:08 am</p><hr />

Yes, I concur that the internal workings are not necessary information for a beginner.

I don't know if this has already been said in the posts above (too lazy to read them it takes less effort to just write it), you have to do your $2006/7 updates in your VBlank, and THEN do two $2005 writes and one $2000 write.<br />This will set the scroll correctly.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"><br />And anyway, that's the point of coding for a platform like NES if you don't try to understand how it works?<br /></div><br />You got the spirit.

Okay. Now I get it. I was wondering for a long time why $2005 writes weren't enough to make the screen stay still. (As all PPU writes happen during the vblank, and screen remained at wrong position even when there were no PPU writes during the current frame)<br />But this was because i didn't write to $2000 again, and hence writes to $2006 trashed D11-D10 of Loopy_T.<br /><br />Nice to finally understand the magic behind this.

For example, if you don't reset the fine X scroll the screen might get shifted up to 7 pixels to the right, but that won't happen on the PowerPak because its boot ROM did initialize the X scroll.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=95">tokumaru</a> — Wed Nov 03, 2010 12:00 am</p><hr />
