<br />You publish your name and stuff for J. Random Stranger who stumbles across your site to see, but you want to keep it secret from the nesdev community.
<br />
<br />Do you believe the members of the nesdev community are more likely to be dangerous sexual predators wishing to break into your home and wake you up in the middle of the night by licking your toes than J. Random Stranger surfing the web?
<br />
<br />If you know something about this community I don't, you better start warning the rest of us.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />FWIW, I tend to agree with the above sentiment.
<br />
<br />Don't worry so much about people looking for your name or where you live.  Dedicated weirdos will absolutely go to great extremes to find out who you are; it doesn't matter how much anonymity you put in front of yourself, they *will* find out who you are.  In fact, with how the Internet is today, the more paranoid you are the more likely you are to be a target of someone's boredom.  Try not to get too hung up on it.
<br />
<br />It's pretty unlikely anyone will pick you as a musician if they can't (on their own time) review some of your work.  If you're simply embarrassed, that's understandable.  I can't speak for the other moderators, but I won't tolerate idiotic "lol ur muzik sucks d00d" nonsense.  But do expect people to critique your work; the same applies to anything.  Learning/improving is part of human life!
<br />
<br />For example: I can't compose music worth a damn, yet I made the mistake (under peer pressure) of putting the one .S3M file I made back in 1993 up on Usenet, where it's now archived.  I cringed listening to it back then, and I still cringe.  There's only one part to it which I think is even remotely decent, and it's at the end.  It pretty much taught me that music is something I enjoy listening to/appreciating rather than composing.  :-)  I'd be pretty impressed if someone dug it up (I know a couple sites that have it, but it's pretty difficult to find unless you know exactly what to look for), but I sure as heck won't be giving out the URL, haha.

<br />Given that it was on LinkedIn, I assume it might have something to do with not wanting to tip off employers to the fact that one is involved with NESdev. Some employers have an "all your IP are belong to us" policy. Others might look down on the community's use of CIClone and more generally unauthorized development for a nominally closed platform, and possibly fire people who get involved in such a community.

<br />They blocked NESDEV in the place I used to work (I used to post a lot from there), classifying it as a gaming site. At my new work people can do pretty much anything (there's no such thing as NSFW), as long as they complete the work that is assigned to them.

<br />DRD can fit in UNROM, it's not a big game.
<br />But one cool guy(Banshaku) helped me with making Famitracker driver into NESASM code.And it supports VRC6.I like idea of extra audio.Besides...VRC6 have SRAM while UNROM not.

<br />So,what do you think about helping me out?:)
