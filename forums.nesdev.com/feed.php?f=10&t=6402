Wow, I never thought about it like that, actually. Still, you're limited in what you can do, and if you have lookup tables where you use the tile ID as an index, you're forced to have it be at least 192 bytes if you want to use the fourth palette. In that case, you might actually <em>save</em> space by having an extra lookup table for attribute information. But of course, you have to look at your end results to see which is more efficient (once you have all your metatiles defined, try both methods and see which one saves you space/time).<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=138">Celius</a> — Sun May 23, 2010 12:18 am</p><hr />

I always have collision information embedded in my 16x16 metatile definitions. However, I do like to have palette information tied to my 32x32 metatiles. That way all I have to do to make levels is place tiles in a grid, and since I'm only specifying which tile goes where, it allows me to free up bits for more tile definitions (so I don't have to sacrifice bits for color/collision information when designing levels). Having the color information with 32x32 metatiles also saves time, as you don't have to do as much bit manipulation as you do with 16x16 metatiles.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=138">Celius</a> — Sat May 22, 2010 5:41 pm</p><hr />

If you represent your game's world as a grid of metatiles, then ideally, surface characteristics such as slope, solidity, and slipperiness should be attached to the metatiles, not the map. For example, the map might say "ice blocks here", and then you'd look up the friction for "ice block" in a table.<br /><br />Which way are you scrolling?

I definitely wouldn't recommend leaving out collision/physics data from being compressed in some way. Storing large arrays of collision data in ROM would be a waste. You might want to store collision data for each 32x32 block or 16x16 block, whichever you find suits you best as there isn't just 1 correct answer. Storing Attribute data in your 32x32 blocks makes sense as each attribute table byte represents that much space and could make your updating of the attribute table less complicated. Although you could do it for smaller areas by saving a copy of the attribute table in RAM somewhere as I remember some people suggesting.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=1726">MottZilla</a> — Sat May 22, 2010 12:17 pm</p><hr />
