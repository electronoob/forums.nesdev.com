Hello there guys, I've successfully created some repros.<br />So much fun ! lol, except i've only made single rom 8bit ones.<br /><br />I have a question, because my next try, will be multi eprom.<br /><br />I know that, to use more than 1 EPROM in a single rom donor cart, the donor cart needs to have a mad 1 right? <br />(if I'm wrong, how to use multi eprom on a non mad-1 chip donor cart?)<br /><br />Then, if we need more than 1 extra eprom, we need 74hct139 right?<br />Please correct me if im wrong.<br /><br />Well, I opened a donor cart here, SHVC-1A3B-12.<br /><br />This doesn't have a MAD-1 . It has an HD74LS139P.<br />I am confused because, it looks to me it does the same job the mad-1 would, but it isn't a mad-1.<br /><br />How do I wire to eproms with this?<br /><br />Thanks !<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=6760">tt_bala</a> — Thu Nov 20, 2014 9:09 pm</p><hr />
