Where I'm from (Ontario, Canada) new SNES games were usually about $70 CAD. Older games tended to go for a lot cheaper.<br /><br />Chrono Trigger was $100 CAD the day it came out (late 1995), and that was unusually expensive. I had been saving for a long time and was ready! The only other SNES game I remember with such a high price was Earthbound.<br /><br />At the time the CAD / USD exchange rate was something like 75 cents, and if you want to account for inflation I think we're looking at ~150% since then.<br /><br />Here's a video game catalogue from 1996, and the prices look about right to me:<br /><a href="http://www.cdarchive.ca/UltimateVideo1996.pdf" class="postlink">http://www.cdarchive.ca/UltimateVideo1996.pdf</a><p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=5165">rainwarrior</a> — Sat Jul 15, 2017 8:24 am</p><hr />

I seem to remember NES games being 399 to 499 SEK in stores while SNES games were 499 to 599 at some point around '95 (i remember the time vaguely because Magic the Gathering 4th edition was newly out in the same stores). The inflation from that time is ~1.25.<br /><br />Just a few years later on nes games could be bought second hand for 50 SEK a piece with no regard to what game it was. <br /><br />Was Bergsala the general agent in all of scandinavia + finland, or just sweden?<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=7508">FrankenGraphics</a> — Mon Jun 26, 2017 12:38 pm</p><hr />

I was too young to be interested in games at that time, but I heard that the SNES games were crazy expensive in the console's early days, something like the equivalent of 130€ per game. Maybe this was just in Switzerland though ?<br /><br />No toploader NES was released here though, so if people wanted a NES they just had to buy the regular front-loading model, even late in the console's life (that or a famiclone).<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=38">Bregalad</a> — Mon Jun 26, 2017 5:35 am</p><hr />

I didn't really see that effect until much later. Of course I really wanted a SNES, but there was so much cool stuff on the NES that I was really happy with what I had. The notion that a game was old or outdated didn't really exist either, at least from that generation on - any new release was just an exciting new addition to the existing library. Of course it was amazing what the newer machines could pull off, and what you saw in the arcades was even more incredible - but that was really just additional stuff. I got SMB3 shortly after SMB1, and would switch back and forth between both games, as they were, and still remain, equally great titles <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />Since you're from Sweden you probably also &quot;suffered&quot; a late release of CV3, the game came here -after- Castlevania 4 did, which gave is a bit of a backlash, but it was also my first real introduction to the series, and I loved it.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=7819">Sumez</a> — Mon Jun 26, 2017 5:10 am</p><hr />

In fact, a lot of parents complained about or at least thought that the SNES was overpriced, and there was this common notion that the &quot;Super Nintendo&quot; was a marketing trick - why pay for the &quot;super&quot; prefix when you can get a nintendo for half the price? Why buy a new console when the kids already have one? And look at the ramped up prices of these &quot;super&quot; games... <br /><br />My parents reasoned as such, so i got a NES with smb1/suck hunt, barker bill's trick shooting and castlevania 3 - the latter made me a proud nes player but it was clear that you had to have SNES and later a playstation to be cool. &quot;NES&quot; even became a derogatory term in school for something bad or ugly looking.  <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt=":roll:" title="Rolling Eyes" /><p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=7508">FrankenGraphics</a> — Mon Jun 26, 2017 4:50 am</p><hr />

A lot of kids couldn't afford a SNES, I personally didn't get my NES until after the SNES came out, and it still had a ton of fresh titles coming out at this point (as most would probably agree - most of the system's best titles came out during this period). Maybe I was being a little naive, but I don't feel the concept of a new console generation completely &quot;replacing&quot; the previous one really existed at this point, and wasn't introduced until later for marketing reasons.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=7819">Sumez</a> — Mon Jun 26, 2017 4:27 am</p><hr />

A hypothetical revision could have had a programmable clock rate which newer games could set, but this clearly wasn't the intention of the 1993 release. Rather, i think it should be seen as the budget alternative to the SNES and help sell off remaining stock of NES titles. Were nintendo licenses entry fee only, or did they cut royalty off sales aswell?<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=7508">FrankenGraphics</a> — Mon Jun 26, 2017 4:08 am</p><hr />

If a newer NES model was clocked faster than an older one, we'd probably have a ton of highly timing-reliant games that would break completely. Battletoads comes to mind.<br /><br />Basically, there are a lot of games (especially popular in western productions) that use funky tricks to execute certain code on specific scanlines etc. that requires exact knowledge of how fast the code is executed. I think Nintendo must have been well aware of this when making later NES revisions.<br /><br />Btw, I only ever play games on my toploader, and expectedly never had issues with any of them. The fact that you don't have to apply pressure on the connector when inserting games definitely makes it easier to make more games work as long as you keep them clean.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=7819">Sumez</a> — Mon Jun 26, 2017 3:34 am</p><hr />
