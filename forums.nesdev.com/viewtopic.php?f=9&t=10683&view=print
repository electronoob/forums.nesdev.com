Running it at 5V is a waste of energy.<br /><br />However, if your goal is to build a cart which is compatible with all unmodified NES then it's a no-no.<br />Regulators are cheap and the SRAM chip will dissipate so little power that the regulator also will dissipate almost nothing so I think there is no problem.<br />You don't even need a regulator, with a Zener diode and an AOP you can make one (since +5V is already regulated).

I wouldn't rely on it aside from experimentation or temporarily running with non 5v tolerant logic as I was doing.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />If it fails at 3.1V, then 3.5V is probably large enough to be considered safe, and is probably still in tolerance of 3.3V chips.<br /><br />By changing the current flow in the amplification circuit past the PPU you could probably restore the video signal so that it's not darker than usual.<br /><br />However, even if the CPU and PPU are safe to run slighly above 3V, at which voltage the system will fail depends mostly on the SRAM chips which depends on the cart and of the SRAM chips inside the console, which may vary very greatly so that's a problem.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Is there an easy way to tell if a LVTTL chip will be 5V tolerant? And what does 5V tolerant mean exactly? I've seen a lot of discussions about parts with maximum tolerances on their I/O pins specified at 4.6 volts being &quot;5V tolerant&quot; because of how the pins are connected to ground inside the chip, causing feedback on the I/O channel rather than exceeding the forward voltage on a die transistor. Is this really &quot;5V tolerant&quot;, or is this &quot;it won't melt in a 5V system&quot;? Seems to me like it's the latter.

There's also no reason to; the amount of power when plugged in is small, and even this 1.5V drop of Vcc isn't enough to bring down power consumption to &quot;reasonable to run on batteries&quot;<br /><br /><br />The datasheet will tell you whether any give chip is 5V tolerant; they'll explicitly say &quot;5V tolerant I/O&quot; somewhere. Sometimes they limit it to specific pins.<br /><br />Most ICs have ESD protection diodes from ground to all their outputs and from all their outputs to Vcc. For a 3.3V chip, this means that there's a practical maximum voltage you can apply of about 4.0V before you start powering the chip through its I/O lines, which is bad.<br /><br />Otherwise, as far as I know, the only way you have real maximum logic voltages are things like oxide thickness on the gates of the MOSFETs. (Or maybe too much power dissipated, when working with BJTs)

Add a series resistor to limit current for each input, and you have a voltage divider.  AFAIK, datasheets don't describe this usually.  But for various parts there are application notes, I know at least this is done with certain Xilinx FPGAs, and Parallax Propeller.<br /><br />BTW the original question, if the answer wasn't clear, yes, that SRAM should work on NES.

So if its specs say it can tolerate -0.5V to +5.5V, then it's 5V-tolerant. A maximum rating of 4.6V is not 5V logic-tolerant. A device seeming to work after you apply voltage outside its maximum ratings isn't any indication of 5V tolerance. For example, BJT transistors may seem to work after exceeding the base's reverse voltage (-5V or so), but their hFE will be permanently degraded.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"> lidnariq wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">Don't undervolt the NES.

Be sure to use very large resistors if you want to go this way.
