It's a free download for any iPad, iPhone or iPod touch running iOS 5 or later. <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/battle-kid-2-lite/id546423050" class="postlink">View Battle Kid 2 Lite on the App Store</a><br /><br />The app features the latest version of my Macifomlite emulator/ROM wrapper and has the following new features:<br /><ul>* Native support for iPhone, iPad and iPod touch at standard and Retina resolutions.<br />* Square-pixel and 4:3 aspect ratios available in portrait and landscape modes, respectively.<br />* Support for iCade-compatible external Bluetooth controllers. (Configurable from the BK2 Lite item in the Settings app)<br />* 60fps video and 44.1khz audio on all supported devices.</ul><br />For those who are interested, I'd be grateful for any feedback on the app via PM. I plan to push an update to coincide with the full cartridge release from RetroZone.<br /><br />I'd also appreciate it if someone would heckle the first reviewer  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />

I've surprised myself with how proficient I've become with the touch controls in portrait mode, though.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">thefox wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">Some criticism:<br />- Still slight stuttering on the audio from time to time.<br />- Nearest-point filtering in the landscape mode looks kind of crappy, especially in text parts.

For the next version I'm making my audio buffer a tick longer to smooth over that. I'm mindful of audio latency, though. It would be nice if I could sync to sound as I do on the desktop but I don't have an efficient way to do that yet.<br />- I'm going to look into tepples' suggestion here.<br />- I did this so I could have the same scaling in place for landscape mode with and without external controls enabled. It doesn't work so well for games like Battle Kid where you enter from one side of the screen and exit through another in nearly every room. For the next version I think I'll scale the video less in landscape when using touch controls to keep it out of the video area.<br /><br />Thank you for the honest feedback. It really helps me to prioritize changes for the next version.  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" />

I've rewritten my touch routines to be more tolerant of errant taps, reduced the size of the dead-zone in the center of the d-pad, and redid landscape mode on iPhone along the lines of Mega Man 2.<br /><br />On top of that, I've implemented a new mode where you can output to an HDTV and use the whole surface of the device as a controller. You can even pair a Bluetooth controller in this mode and basically have a wireless NES. It's a little more costly, but it upscales to HD quite nicely! I uploaded <a href="http://youtu.be/ObyGoXf1sZ0" class="postlink">a little demonstration.</a>

Sorry, but I have no idea how to reproduce this.<br />- In landscape mode clicking on top of the screen takes you to retrousb.com, even though there's no visible link. I tried couple of times to open the notifications bar or whatever it's called (you know, by sliding downwards at the top of the screen), and it would open up the link instead. Also when I returned to the game again, it would sometimes re-open the page instantaneously even when I didn't touch anything.<br />- Sometimes the controls didn't seem to work after re-opening the game. Once again, no idea how to reproduce this, but I'll let you know if it keeps on occurring again.<br />- Would be nice to have an option to turn the sound off. Also would be nice if it allowed the music player to be used while playing the game.

The problem with the d-pad getting stuck in one direction was something I saw on a pre-release build but appeared to be resolved by a code change. It's possible that iOS cancelled a touch for some reason and didn't send me a 'touchesEnded' notification. I'll have to look into that.<br /><br />Having the RetroZone link still work in landscape is a little wonky, I agree. I'll change that for the next update. I've not had trouble pulling up Notifications, losing touch or having the link re-open so I'm wondering if your config and mine have behavioral differences.<br /><br />Could you PM me with your device model and iOS version so I can see if there's a config-specific issue here? Thanks.

The purchase link and rotation would still respond, making it seem like the controls had just stopped working. Not sure whether or not that's related to your earlier report.<br /><br />I spent some time trying to make the + / - buttons adjust ringer volume rather than app volume, but even with audio playback disabled it doesn't happen. Maybe your phone thought it was plugged into an audio dock?<br /><br />Thanks for the info, as always. PM me with other weird happenings.
