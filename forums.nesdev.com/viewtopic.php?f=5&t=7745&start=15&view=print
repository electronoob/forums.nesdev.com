<br />I hate how in DuckTales NES, you have to hold B+down in midair to do a pogo jump, instead of just holding B like in the GB port and all the other games. This has caused me a great amount of deaths and frustration.
<br />
<br />So I <em>"fixed"</em> the game's code myself, and now the controls are much smoother, such that I can beat the game over and over on my NES, just simply because pogo jumping, which is a frequently-needed ability, is less tedious to do.
<br />
<br />I wholly support *-without-the-suck hacks, in other words. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" />

<br />Hey Drag, can you cut that Duck Tales patch down to three Game Genie codes? If so I'd love you lots <img src="./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=":wink:" title="Wink" /> 
<br />
<br />I need to get off my butt and un-suck Fester's Quest (well, remove a part of it anyway). There's a bug that stops weapon power-ups from ever spawning again after you reach the top weapon level, even if you get your gun down-graded or die. And to top it off the best gun is the only one that shoots straight, making it the only gun you can effectively use in many parts of the game.
<br />
<br />I've always wanted to RE that bug and fix it with a Game Genie code. We could start a list of Game Genie codes to un-suck games <img src="./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" />

<br />I still don't see what it has to do with writing or fiction.
<br />
<br />Speaking of un-sucking, here's a Double Dragon III patch that let's players keep enemies' weapons when they die:

<br />
<br />Although, due to sprite limitations, the weapon sprites will change to its corresponding enemy when they appear. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_lol.gif" alt=":lol:" title="Laughing" />

<br />It's funny because I had to change exactly 3 bytes to get it working. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" />
<br />However, just changing those 3 bytes effectively disables your ability to do a midair golf swing (push against a wall, jump while still pushing against the wall, and hit B in midair). In order to allow simplified pogo jumping while preserving your ability to do a midair golf swing, I had to rearrange a routine as well as change those 3 bytes. :\
<br />
<br />Edit:
<br />I don't know how to encode these, but:
<br />E68A = 04 -&gt; 40
<br />EA27 = 44 -&gt; 40
<br />EA29 = 44 -&gt; 40
<br />
<br />That should make your life easier, but like I said, if you want simplified pogo + midair golf swings, you'll need <a href="http://www.romhacking.net/hacks/749/" class="postlink">this</a>.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I played Strider on PS1 when it was released with Strider 2. Strider 2 could have been super awesome but it was WAY too easy (basically infinite lives and continues, and when you die you come back in exactly the same place and the boss is at exactly the health it was at when you died). Strider 1, which was probably the arcade or SEGA version, was really cool. It was challenging, had some cool imagery, and was just plain fun.
<br />
<br />Strider for the NES was weird. I didn't get very far in it at all, I couldn't figure out some of the platforming, and I didn't invest that much time or interest in it. If I play through it at all, it will be because I enjoyed the other version I played.

<br />
<br />Oh my gosh, the grim reaper sucks so bad. I think I use axes or crosses to beat him... Frankenstein is also a pain.
<br />
<br />I find anything in Castlevania involving Belmont platforming and dodging of projectile enemies/fireballs to be completely aggravating.
