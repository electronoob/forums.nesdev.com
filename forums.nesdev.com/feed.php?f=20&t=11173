You <em>can</em> use an Atmega or another MCU, but it is the <em>wrong tool for the job</em> and the gains from doing it that way are not clear.

... Emulating an MBC on the RPi? Well, you're not going to be running linux on it, that's for sure.<br /><br />Nevermind that the power budget is daft: the DMC/CGB/GBA consumes about one half to one fifth the power the RPi does. Also the RPi isn't 5V tolerant, and the DMG/CGB are only 5V.<br /><br />Assuming that you don't want to add the several AND gates, you'll need to have a loop that can always determine what the CPU is doing, and react within 1 microsecond. This should¹ be doable—after all, the Atari 2600 Harmony Cart emulates a ROM using a 70MHz ARM—but using RPi for it is rather like using a smartphone as a hammer... sure, it might work, but you're as likely to hurt yourself or break something as drive the nail.<br /><br /><br />¹: &quot;should&quot; because the RPi will have some amount of instruction/data caching latency that could screw up your budget.

An EEPROM/EPROM/PROM/Flash would be far superior to a 74xx138. The amount of discrete logic requried to decode up to 256 different addresses for ANY address on the bus (16bit), would be enormous. And as we're not considering CPLD's or FPGA's, an EPROM as an address decoder would save much board space, at a speed that would surpass any MCU. An EPROM could also do the job of an MBC quite easily, with additional address lines used to select modes of operation.

The Atari 2600's Harmony cart can emulate a 32KiB ROM accessed by a 6502 clocked at 1.2MHz using a 70MHz ARM. (It also does a number of really other fun things, like automagic loop unrolling).  The timing constraints here are about twice as tight, but I think we need to do less.<br /><br />The big killer for emulating RAM (or ROM) is interrupt or task latency. Simply running things faster doesn't <em>necessarily</em> help, because faster CPUs often have more state they need to save when one thread interrupts another.<br /><br />The Arduino Mega appears to be an atmega1280, which ... is this &quot;xbus&quot; thing what the datasheet refers to as the External Memory Interface? Unfortunately, that's for connecting the microcontroller to external memory-mapped peripherals (i.e. as atmega is still acting as the cpu), not to emulate a peripheral. Some PICs do have a &quot;parallel slave port&quot; that can respond to a host CPU with no latency, in the manner required here, but it's only one byte. It'd be really hard to make it work like RAM.<br /><br />Burning an EEPROM as a decoder would be hard to justify as meaningfully different than a 74'138... This isn't doing anything particularly fancy here.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3512">lidnariq</a> — Fri Apr 25, 2014 12:33 am</p><hr />

Maybe if you were to use one of the arduino Mega's? It has an Xbus interface. Not too familiar with it, but perhaps it could monitor your data and address bus along with control signals? All just ideas. How about burning an EEPROM with a bit mask which sits on the address bus and generates outputs on its data bus when reads/writes to particular addresses are made. Use these outputs to latch registers. You could have a very complicated, narrow set of addresses that trigger certain functions.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=6460">BennVenn</a> — Thu Apr 24, 2014 5:46 pm</p><hr />

Implementing the MBC2's RAM will be nigh-impossible. The address bus is only stable 2cy (500ns for a 4MHz game) before you need to have the value presented to the GBZ80, so that only gives you 10 instructions in a 20MIPS atmega... and I think you lose at least 5 of those just in interrupt latency. Other sources imply closer to 8-11... you're too late before your code even starts executing!<br /><br />A PIC might almost be able to do it... They max out at 16MIPS, and I can think of a way to implement a 256 byte RAM (yes, too small) in 6cy (375ns).<br /><br /><a href="http://www.embeddedrelated.com/usenet/embedded/show/1437-1.php" class="postlink">Someone asked about hooking up an atmega to the ISA bus</a>, which doesn't run tremendously faster than the GB...

Capture lets you know exactly when something happened, regardless of how much later you get to it.<br /><br />Compare lets you change a few pins (five? if you cleverly abuse all three of the atmega's counters) in response to a pin changing. So, you might be able to use that to emulate an AND gate, but I bet there's still situations where you'll need to have your interrupt routine finish in 1µs (such as fetching data from 0x4xxx while executing code from 0x0xxx)<br /><br />Fundamentally, the MBC1 and MBC5 are just a few latches and some decoding logic. The MBC2 and MBC3 are a little more complicated (with internal RAM or an RTC).<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3512">lidnariq</a> — Thu Apr 24, 2014 2:09 pm</p><hr />
