Cool, thanks for that. Yes, I think you're right, what I'm viewing on my windows PC is probably already fatter than how it may originally have looked. On the other hand, I left out the detail that this DOS game was developed far after DOS's heyday, and very well may have been developed on a windows machine with a PAR of 1:1. So perhaps the final SNES version will not be all that bad. I'll just have to see.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3735">GradualGames</a> — Wed Feb 04, 2015 12:51 pm</p><hr />

I agree. I find that squashing the screen looks terrible, and it can make porting a game more difficult as well. (adjusting the tile map, and resizing the graphics.) I really don't think losing 32 pixels on each side is <em>that</em> big of a loss, and for a lot of platform games where the character is always dead center in the middle of the screen, you can just adjust the camera to where it focusses a bit in front of the character. If you aren't sure what I mean, see what happens when you turn on Donkey Kong Country. (It's little things like this that make the Donkey Kong Country games very solid, in my opinion.)<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=6683">Espozo</a> — Wed Feb 04, 2015 11:31 am</p><hr />

What I'm sincerely hoping is the game will look alright without modifying the graphics at all. If the scrollable area is cropped, so be it. If the sprites look a little fatter, so be it. Playing the game on my Windows PC, probably stretches the sprites out already from how they would have looked on an old CRT monitor in actual Mode 13h, as I'm pretty sure the pixel aspect ratio is 1:1 viewing the game on my PC. I think I'd only try to scale the graphics if it winds up looking really squat on the SNES, which I suppose is a possibility. I won't know til I try to convert that first sprite. I don't yet know the internals of the tile system of the PC game. I have the source but, til I finish my current project won't be able to truly dig in. Just trying to get a preliminary taste of what might be in store for me.

Different TVs are known to cut off different amounts of the picture. Because of certain low-level details of CRT operation, a CRT driven at 240p with short scanlines (341 instead of standard 341.25 dots per line) and short fields (262 instead of standard 262.5 dots per frame) may cut off more at the top than the bottom.<br /><br />What the public has seen of official NES developer documentation (the &quot;background planning sheets&quot;) recommends not putting anything important in the left or right 16 pixels or the top and bottom 24 pixels of NTSC. But the NES always runs in overscan mode, so in Super NES 224-line mode, that translates to 16 pixels from each side. But then this guideline is fairly conservative, equating to an 80% safe area. The 1970s TVs in use in the early Famicom days were not calibrated as precisely as the 1980s TVs used with the Super Famicom and Super NES, and video production standards switched to a 90% safe area sometime in the 1990s (source: BBC).<br /><br />A practical safe area for TVs made in the 1980s and later is the area visible in the PocketNES emulator for the Game Boy Advance. In NES or Super NES overscan terms, this cuts 16 pixels from the top, 11 from the bottom, and 8 from the left and right side. In Super NES 224-line mode, it is equivalent to cutting 3 pixels from the bottom and 8 from the other three sides.<br /><br />Best case, you'll be able to shrink 320x200 to around 240x200 and have things look mostly the same. There are tools to automate clean scaling of pixel art, such as my own Rotpixels that applies three passes of EPX followed by nearest neighbor resampling. But to evaluate the feasibility of that, I'll need to know the metatile size if it's a 2D game.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=9">tepples</a> — Tue Feb 03, 2015 9:50 pm</p><hr />
