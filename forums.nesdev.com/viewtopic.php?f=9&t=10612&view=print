I would think a custom chip would cost more to manufacture, and (as I understand it) the only difference is that the 6502 has a decimal mode.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />PPU is completely custom.  As for costs, Nintendo promised Ricoh they'd buy a ton of them and was able to get pricing comparable to as if it weren't custom because of volume.  If you order large enough volumes of any chip it doesn't suffer custom/small volume pricing.<br /><br />The 6502 doesn't have an APU, the 2A03 does.  Nintendo didn't get rights from MOS to use the 6502, to get around that they cut a single trace to remove BCD mode.  The BCD hardware is all there from what I understand, it's just missing the vital trace/via to allow it to work.  Removing BCD functionality allowed them to cheat by the patent docs as 3gen brought up, even though the hardware is actually on die.<br /><br />Not paying for a licensed 6502 probably saved them a heap of money.  As did choosing a CPU small enough to make room for an APU on the same die.

On the other hand, had Nintendo just used the TMS9918, it would have re-created the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VTech_CreatiVision" class="postlink">CreatiVision</a>.

I would be really pissed if someone did that to a processor I designed in order to avoid paying for it, but if it is technically legal, then I can see why they did it.<br /><br />It just occurred to me last night that the PPU probably had to be a custom chip, given Nintendo's requirements.  I can see a market for the sound chip, but I couldn't see one for a graphics chip like the PPU.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Well, the just mentioned TMS9918 was probably the first general purpose PPU (VDP, whatever you call it), designed to be used in video game systems. It precedes NES PPU, and in fact it had pretty large market - it was used in many home computers, including the whole MSX1 family, and in game consoles, such as ColecoVision and early Sega systems (pre-SMS). If NES PPU would be available as a general purpose chip, I think it would have its own market as well, as it is certainly superior to 9918, and they coexisted in more of less the same timeframe.

I recall an anecdote about MOS investigating the 2A03 and being dismayed when they discovered that Nintendo had precisely disabled the decimal circuitry in the 2A03 with a single cut trace.<br /><br />Since 1990, we now have a concept of <em>mask copyright</em>, which allows for copyright-like protection for a term of 10 years. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_circuit_layout_design_protection" class="postlink">Wikipedia</a> can tell you more.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />If i remember correctly Ricoh (which made both the ppu and cpu for the nes) had a license for the 6502. So changing that minor thing on the masks that they already had available, made it cheaper since they avoided the licensing cost (as mentioned above). The only drawback was that 2A03/2A07 wasn't binary compatible with other 6502 cpus since it lacked the BCD mode, but nintendo used z80 back then so they probably didn't bother much.

A couple things I remember from it was that Ricoh was in some trouble at the time, having a factory with nothing to produce, so Nintendo gave them Donkey Kong and told them to design an IC that could play it.  And that one reason the 6502 was desirable over the Z80 was that it was relatively unknown in Japan.
