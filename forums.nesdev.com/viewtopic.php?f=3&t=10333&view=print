		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Hi!<br />I restarted the development of my NES emulator that I started back in 1997. I thought that nothing would work but to my surprise, I did not had much tweaking to do to at least make the intro screens of a few games show. But now my next step is to make the attribute table works. I don't plan release this emulator, I am doing this for fun.<br /><br />Right now, I can see the intro of Ice Hockey with a few animations with also a few glitches. I succeeded to get the sprites colours right, but the backgrounds colours are still off. I think that my attribute table code is the problem. So, I would like to know if someone can tell me if I am wrong or not and why.<br /><br />So, this is how I do it (I changed a few things for readability, it is coded in C):<br /><br />xTile and yTile are the coordinates of the tile, not in pixels, but in tile coordinates.<br />address is the address of the attribute table, I add 23C0 to it later.<br /><br />xP = (xTile / 4);<br />yP = (yYile / 4) * 32;<br />address = yP + xP;<br /><br /><br />Then to isolate the group of 2 bits to use in the final palette index (33 - 22 - 11 - 00) <br />I do :<br /><br />x = (xTile / 2) mod 2;<br />y = (yTile / 2) mod 2;<br />bits = y &lt;&lt; 1 or x;<br /><br />So, bits contains values : 0, 1, 2 or 3.<br /><br />Then I take the byte from the attribute table with the address that I found in the upper code and I isolate the bits to place them in the right position.<br />So that I get xx00 where xx the bits variable that I got.<br /><br />bits = ((attTable[address ] &gt;&gt; (bits * 2)) &lt;&lt; 2)<br /><br /><br />This code is NOT optimized. It is somewhat hard to understand and maybe there is easier way to do this. I am open to suggestions. <br /><br />Tell me me if it is too complicated or if I forgot something.<br />Thanks!

I thought 32 because of the 32 tiles on a horizontal line,  but we are talking about 32 / 4 = 8 attribute squares. It removed the strange artifacts that I had in the intro of Ice Hockey. The colours are still not perfect. If nobody find something else in my code then I will take for granted that it is right and I will search elsewhere in my code.<br /><br />I also have another problem with the paddle reading, but I will probably make another topic for this.<br />Thanks!!

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Things I notice:<br /><br />1. The screen itself seems to be too small -- your screenshot should be 768x720, yet it's 768x602.  This would explain the &quot;weird graphics&quot; at the bottom of the picture (the box which should say (C) 1988 NINTENDO) being cropped.<br /><br />2. Looks like for the &quot;ICE HOCKEY&quot; part of the screen you're using palette set index #4 (i.e. the 5th palette entry) rather than set index #3 (i.e. the 4th palette entry).  Index #4 consists of colours $00/$36/$00/$16 (or possibly $0f/$36/$00/$16 due to how the mirroring of #0 works), and index #3 consists of colours $0f/$31/$30/$22.<br /><br />For the player selection and (C) 1988 NINTENDO boxes, you should be using index #2 (colours $0f/$25/$15/$20), but on-screen you're again using index #4.  I mention this because lidnariq wondered about an off-by-one error, and this evidence would refute that possibility.<br /><br />Maybe you have horizontal vs. vertical mirroring implemented wrong? <br /><br />All that that said, this will probably help you the most -- raw <a href="http://wiki.nesdev.com/w/index.php/PPU_attribute_tables" class="postlink">attribute table</a> data for the title screen.

If it doesn't match the above, then you're doing something wrong with regards to PPU accesses or otherwise.  If it's correct, then the issue lies with how you're using the attribute data to do a palette lookup, or how you're doing palette-colours-to-RGB stuff.  It could be either -- but at least you got sprites correct.  :-)<br /><br />Edit: Oh, I forgot another one -- here's the palette portion of PPU RAM as well, along with the mirrored copies ($3f20 onward):<br /><br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">00003F00&nbsp; 0F 36 06 27 0F 15 05 00 0F 25 15 20 0F 31 30 22&nbsp; .6.'.....%. .10&quot;<br />00003F10&nbsp; 00 36 00 16 00 36 12 29 00 20 30 16 00 36 16 30&nbsp; .6...6.). 0..6.0<br /><br />00003F20&nbsp; 0F 36 06 27 0F 15 05 00 0F 25 15 20 0F 31 30 22&nbsp; .6.'.....%. .10&quot;<br />00003F30&nbsp; 00 36 00 16 00 36 12 29 00 20 30 16 00 36 16 30&nbsp; .6...6.). 0..6.0<br />00003F40&nbsp; 0F 36 06 27 0F 15 05 00 0F 25 15 20 0F 31 30 22&nbsp; .6.'.....%. .10&quot;<br />00003F50&nbsp; 00 36 00 16 00 36 12 29 00 20 30 16 00 36 16 30&nbsp; .6...6.). 0..6.0<br />00003F60&nbsp; 0F 36 06 27 0F 15 05 00 0F 25 15 20 0F 31 30 22&nbsp; .6.'.....%. .10&quot;<br />00003F70&nbsp; 00 36 00 16 00 36 12 29 00 20 30 16 00 36 16 30&nbsp; .6...6.). 0..6.0<br />00003F80&nbsp; 0F 36 06 27 0F 15 05 00 0F 25 15 20 0F 31 30 22&nbsp; .6.'.....%. .10&quot;<br />00003F90&nbsp; 00 36 00 16 00 36 12 29 00 20 30 16 00 36 16 30&nbsp; .6...6.). 0..6.0<br />00003FA0&nbsp; 0F 36 06 27 0F 15 05 00 0F 25 15 20 0F 31 30 22&nbsp; .6.'.....%. .10&quot;<br />00003FB0&nbsp; 00 36 00 16 00 36 12 29 00 20 30 16 00 36 16 30&nbsp; .6...6.). 0..6.0<br />00003FC0&nbsp; 0F 36 06 27 0F 15 05 00 0F 25 15 20 0F 31 30 22&nbsp; .6.'.....%. .10&quot;<br />00003FD0&nbsp; 00 36 00 16 00 36 12 29 00 20 30 16 00 36 16 30&nbsp; .6...6.). 0..6.0<br />00003FE0&nbsp; 0F 36 06 27 0F 15 05 00 0F 25 15 20 0F 31 30 22&nbsp; .6.'.....%. .10&quot;<br />00003FF0&nbsp; 00 36 00 16 00 36 12 29 00 20 30 16 00 36 16 30&nbsp; .6...6.). 0..6.0<br /></div>

My emulator was in mode 13h at first. Now that it is in Windows, I will correct it later.<br /><br />I did a dump just like you suggested. 0 values are normal in the attribute table because I redirect read/write to 23c0 for mirroring (same thing for palettes).<br />But I don't understand why I don't have the same values than you in the 3F00 line and why I got 0 in 3f10 line.<br />And I just saw that my sprite colours are not right anymore (if you look at my first screenshot, the 1st sprite was right, now it is like the 3rd sprite).<br /><br />I will continue to look at my code. I just wanted to post what I got. I don't expect the solution now.<br /><br />Here is what I got:<br /><br /><br />Attribute tables<br />23C0 FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF <br />23D0 FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF <br />23E0 AA AA AA AA AA AA AA AA AA AA AA AA AA AA AA AA <br />23F0 55 55 55 55 55 55 55 55 55 55 55 55 55 55 55 55 <br />27C0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 <br />27D0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 <br />27E0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 <br />27F0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 <br />2BC0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 <br />2BD0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 <br />2BE0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 <br />2BF0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 <br />2FC0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 <br />2FD0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 <br />2FE0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 <br />2FF0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 <br /><br />Palette <br />YOUR LINE:<br />3F00  0F 36 06 27 0F 15 05 00 0F 25 15 20 0F 31 30 22<br /><br />MY LINE:<br />3F00 F 36 0 16 F 36 12 29 F 20 30 16 F 36 16 30 <br /><br />And the rest:<br />3F10 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 <br />3F20 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 <br />3F30 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 <br />3F40 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 <br />3F50 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 <br />3F60 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 <br />3F70 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 <br />3F80 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 <br />3F90 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 <br />3FA0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 <br />3FB0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 <br />3FC0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 <br />3FD0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 <br />3FE0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 <br />3FF0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

Chinese or Korean I'd probably be better with. :)<br /><br />So your attribute table is okay (we know what's in $23c0-23ff is correct, and we'll just have to assume that your mirroring code for the other attribute table regions is correct -- if it's wrong, well, that could be part of your problem.  :-) )<br /><br />Your palette entries look like you may have some PPU emulation problems of sorts, or possibly you're doing the mirroring of the palette entries incorrectly.<br /><br />I'm also going to assume $3f20-3fff is being mirrored properly in your code (hence all zeros), but again, if it's not that could explain a lot of things.  To debug mirrored &quot;stuff&quot;, you might have to add some printf() statements or equivalent that log when someone is doing a write to certain areas of PPU RAM which are mirrored and then try to work back where the issue may be.<br /><br />I'm sorry I can't be of much more help, but you can work out all of this yourself using FCEUX (its real-time hex editor and PPU viewing capabilities should help you immensely).  I just do not generally help with emulator code; others here can help with that if need be, but there are lots of open-source emulators you could examine to see if you have the &quot;general logic&quot; incorrect.

Your Japanese is still good, you used the wa particle for contrast which I would not use naturally! I am a manga/anime illustrator (not professionally yet), and I have been learning Japanese for years. But now I am stuck because I should talk in japanese with other people to get better.<br /><br />I did not know that FCEUX had all of this debugging stuff. I noticed in my emulator that the game write 2 times at ppu adress 3f02 (the first incorrect data in the palette). The first time, it does write 06 as it should but it writes 0 the second time. I tried breakpoints in FCEUX and I saw that it writes only one time at this address. So I guess that I have a conditional branching error somewhere. I think that I should log every instruction before this, but I have to write a disassembler for this and it takes time of course.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">mkwong98 wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">In both screenshots the background tiles are using the same palette set as the sprite on the left, so I think you mix up the two.</div><br />Good point, I will check this.<br /><br />Thanks to both of you.

I wanted to work on it but to keep it in DOS, I would have to use DOSBOX and or something else. Also, I have been using Visual Studio at work for years now so, returning to DJGPP would be hard for me.
