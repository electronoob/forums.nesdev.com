		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Hello Everyone,<br /><br />   For those of you who don't know, the Midwest Gaming Classic is a large retro gaming exhibition held in Brookfield, Wisconsin (~20 miles west of Milwaukee) on the last weekend of March (23 + 24 this year).<br /><br />   For the past two years, some of us home-brewers have had exhibition space to show of our homebrew games.<br /><br />   However, this year I will not have an exhibit.  I've been very busy with my 5 month old son, my day job and my consulting work.  Someday I'll crank out 6502 code again <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />  Anyway, even though I personally won't have an exhibit this year, I do plan to attend the event.  I wanted to know if anyone else will be going.<br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.midwestgamingclassic.com/">http://www.midwestgamingclassic.com/</a><!-- m -->

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I will be attending this year as well.<br />My first name is Joe.  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /> <br /><br />That's too bad that there seems there won't be a nes homebrew presence like there was for the prior 2 years in the basement. However there appears to be a NintendoAge annex room opposite the gaming museum... down the same hallway where the food is. maybe some NES related stuff can happen there?<br /><br />As for memories, it was fascinating to see tepples's stuff on private display in 2011... wish I was more personable at the time, but the burning plastic of the modders in the stuffiness of that tiny basement room was making me gag/reddening my eyes. Also yes I suck at Tetris even on a good day. I hope other geniuses like tepples would show up and just show stuff off... it's hard work to prepare, but much appreciated.<br /><br />Last year I remember the NES compilation cartridge. But I was blown away by the N64 dev cart... I love how modestly that inventor answered my question about who discovered how to defeat the N64 security... it was him of course... Plus he answered, accurately, my very pointed questions about how the N64 worked internally. It's rare to be able to speak in person to people like that.<br /><br />I hope to encounter these kinds of fun surprises and people this year as well. What should be generating a buzz is the RetroN 4. Unfortunately they won't say until the unveiling if the audio output is broken like the other clones. What I'm trying to say, is that somehow if a unit like that catches on, the price and availability is right, and is an accurate hardware clone, then homebrew development interest would spike up again.<br /><br />Personally I'm very good at electrical hardware and can read timing diagrams and chip datasheets and draw up schematics, but am pretty terrible at writing low-level language software (even though I understand the individual CPU instructions I can't seem to put them in a useful order without experiencing fatigue).

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Maybe there are such conventions, but they aren't advertised effectively or aren't talked about enough.<br /><br />Interesting story is that on my way back from the MGC, I struck up a conversation with a gas station attendant about my day. He hadn't heard of the MGC yet, despite being an hour's drive away from it, and thought it was an awesome idea being a console game collector himself and having an interest in arcade machines.<br /><br />Just make it a point to talk about your interests with people and maybe something will come of it.

Sunday wrapped up pretty quickly in the NintendoAge room, so I relocated down by the museum.  Not sure if you got a chance to stop by Clueless.  I met a lot of people, but not sure if it was anyone from these forums.
