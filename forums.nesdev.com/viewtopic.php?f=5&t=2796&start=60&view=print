<br />Also, I said something wrong - Street of Rage 2 music is bad. Just the first level one is barely good, and the thing get repetitive so fast !
<br />I definitely don't like the Genesis sound chip at all, but it's just personal, and games can use it very well as they can use it very bad. I just don't like it's limitations. It does only play that crap old synth songs again and again, and I even prefer square wave and triangle wave music (exept for basses maybe, which are definitely the only decent thing the Genesis APU can output).
<br />
<br />Also, I prever CV3 music on most songs because it just sound so much clear, clean, etc... Akumajo Densetsu music is better for a few song, such as the ending one. Some levels aren't much different, but definitely, for the first level, the music is SO much better in CV3 I found.
<br />
<br />EDIT : Another dislikable thing on the Genesis is that of the few games I've tried all have diffent buttons config, while there is only 3 buttons. Almost all NES games have B=Attack and A=Jump, and almost SNES games have B=Jump, Y=Attack. Why should all Genesis games uses so much different buttons config ? I should rewire my joypad allocation each time I'm trying another game to have my traditional button setup. On the real hardware I assume it would be even more, taking the habbit of one setup for a game and then do everything wrong for every new game.

(The Game Gear has a <em>4096</em> colour master palette though.) However, each graphic tile (background/sprites) can use only up to 4 colours(counting the transparent colour) for the Famicom and the SMS can use 16, so the SMS does have an advantage here(it doesn't have as much flexibility as the Famicom in having more subpalettes though; this problem still somewhat affects the Mega Drive).<br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">only the japanese version has 10 fm audio channels /whereass the us,eu required a 6 channel fm module.</div><br />???<br />The original Japanese Mark 3 and the export SMS's do not have a built-in FM unit, but the Mark 3 has an upgrade that adds this capability, which is never released for the export SMS's(they can be modded to have the capability though, and certain games DO benefit from this). The later Japanese SMS model does have the FM unit (and the 3-D glasses interface) built in.<br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">it has a rgb color pallett.</div><br />Yes. But whether this is an advantage or not is up to people's preference.<br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">has no load issues compared with the nes zif loadsystem.</div><br />I cannot comment on this, as the NES failed hard here.

The NES sort of failed though, that the external sound pins are not present on the cartridge connector(without modding that is).<br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">will the nes lacks rgb out those composite video artifacts can give nice effects like water,grain,rainbow amp,chain and can also give a ellussion of extra colors onscreen.</div><br />Again, whether blurry NTSC image is a good thing is up to people's own preference. HOWEVER, from <a href="http://www.disgruntleddesigner.com/chrisc/gotRGB/screenshots.html" class="postlink">what I've heard</a> (linked to Chris's page) while the Famicom has the pixel-shifting effect to minimise these artifacts the SMS (and, quite jarring, includes also the Mega Drive) actually does not have this, so instead the SMS output (when using composite) in general has <em>more</em> such artifacts and blurriness.<br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">the mmc5 chip dramatically extended the nes capability's too allowed more colers,more &amp; bigger sprites,more animations,more tiles,more effects,paralax scrolling and even rotations onscreen.</div>
<br />I think this is rarely used by games though.
<br />
<br />Also, the list can go on, as there are different design choices in certain areas of the two systems there are things that can be done well in one but not the the other system. One example is:
<br />The SMS design abused the background to the max, that background tiles can be flipped and each tile can choose from any of the two subpalettes, giving a maximum of 32... reee... 31 colours for the background plane. But the Famicom does not have hardware flipping for background tiles. On the other hand, the sprite capability of the SMS is quite limited. There is no hardware flipping capability for sprites (a horrible wall-banger) and so if say, your character can face either left or right in a game you either need to store two copies (but flipped) of the graphics in memory or has to flip the sprites in software (sprites can be flipped via the hardware for the Famicom) and only one 16(15 if you don't count the transparent colour) colour subpalette can be used for all the sprites at once (the Famicom has 4 different sprite subpalettes) and so if say you want a palette swap of the same character on screen at the same time (most commonly for 2-player co-op games) you have to store the graphics of both characters.
<br />
<br />The result is, actually each of these systems has its own goods and bads, and it's quite hard to really compare which is actually more powerful. We do know who eventually wins the market in most places on earth though...

<br />
<br />As far as I know, the vastly different CPU architecture makes the processing power of both consoles roughly equivalent.
<br />
<br />The ZIF connector used in the NES was indeed a very unfortunate design choice. Any console is better than the NES in this regard.
<br />
<br />The difference in PCM precision is meaningless, since playing samples requires so much CPU time that it can't be used during gameplay, so it's just a novelty in both cases.
<br />
<br />As for the illusion of extra colors, you don't need illusions when you can use 16 colors per tile. Still, these "effects" are also present on the SMS composite signal.

<br />
<br />Does the SMS VDP's data port allow loading tile or map data during active picture time (that is, not during vertical blanking)? The NES PPU's doesn't, but the Genesis VDP has a four-write-deep FIFO for this.

The graphics display allows for more color depth with is certainly an advantage. But it seems to me that many NES games still managed to look as good or atleast not far behind in that department. Also many NES games thanks to CHR-ROM have lots of animation very smoothly that I did not really see in any SMS games I've played though I haven't played a ton. 
<br />
<br />Really it's a silly debate though as superior hardware means nothing, software is everything. You can have amazing hardware and it means nothing if you have no software people want to play.

<br />
<br />That's exactly right. To put things into perspective, most opcodes on the NES are between 2-5 cycles, because it does multiple things per cycle. On the Z80, <em>everything</em> uses a multiple of 4 cycles per command. As for the actual instruction set, both processors have their strengths and weaknesses. For example, being able to easily do 16-bit operations on the Z80 is pretty useful. However, the zeropage and the special (faster) ZP addressing mode on the 6502 is quite handy too.
<br />
<br />Though, it'd be nice to be able to flip the BG tiles, like you can on the SMS, but then again, I think the SMS can't flip sprites. On the other hand, neither could the MSX, and that's still a pretty highly regarded system itself.
<br />
<br />I dunno, I don't think it's the capabilities of the system that makes it better, it has more to do with how you work within the restrictions.

<br />Some games did it anyways, like Ultimate Stuntman (unlicensed) by Codemasters. In-game it doesn't sound that great though because they only write the samples during ~100 scanlines, but it's decent.

<br />For common retro gamers yes, but a lot of us are developers, so we are able to look at these consoles and see their potential regardless of what has already been released for them. Nintendo's business tactics were pretty dirty back then, and they did everything to keep developers from releasing SMS software. If that wasn't the case, I believe we'd have seen many more impressive SMS games.
<br />
<br />EDIT: Another advantage I can think of about the Master System: I'm pretty sure it has a built-in scanline counter, which means that raster effects are much easier to perform. It's not perfect though, I think it doesn't generate interrupts, so the only way to use it is polling a register, much like the NES with sprite 0 hits, but still much more versatile than those.

<br />
<br />Yes, it has a <a href="http://www.smspower.org/Development/ScanlineCounter" class="postlink">scanline counter</a>, but it also has <a href="http://cgfm2.emuviews.com/txt/smsvdp.txt" class="postlink">interrupts</a> (see section 10). It is very handy, considering the fact that many SMS games (especially earlier ones) use it to generate parallax effects of the playfield. One problem with the SMS is though, I think you cannot modify the Y scrolling value within a frame (I'm not so sure about it) and because of this you cannot do things such as a static status bar on the bottom of the screen and the upper part scrolling vertically (you have to jump through hoops to do this on the NES but at least this can be done). There is a hardware function to lock the first two rows of tiles in position to make for a status bar though. However, it is a bit limited as two rows isn't much (not to mention that these two lines are off-screen in GG mode and thus useless for GG games) and many SMS games actually don't have information such as scores and remaining life displaced onscreen (the default screen height of 192 lines may also be a factor).

<br /> - You cant change the Y value during active display. Only the X value
<br /> - Tilemap size is only 256x224. The display is 256x192 (a few odd tricks/registers can get it to display a little more vertical res)
<br /> - There's a bit in Reg #0 to blank the leftmost 8pixel column (to reduce map update artifacts)
<br /> - Tile map entry include a priority setting per tile. Very useful IMO. You can do more complex over and under lapping part of the BG to sprites
<br /> - Sprites have no priority settings related to the BG
<br /> - Tilemap can assign one of two 16 color subpalettes to a tile
<br /> - Sprites are fixed at using one 16 color subpalette
<br /> - sprites can only access 256 8x8 cells or 128 8x16 cells 
<br /> - There's a register to add an offset for accessing upper 128 8x16 cells (for the whole SAT)
<br /> - Only a first few sprites can be 'scaled'. I don't remember which doc, but Charles told me himself that is was probably a bug from the older TMS video chip logic
<br /> - tiles can access 512 8x8 cells
<br /> - If 8 pixe left shift bit enabled for sprites, sprites won't wrap horizontally around the screen.
<br /> - the top 16 pixels of the display can be left static and untouched by X position for a fixed bar display
<br /> - the left most 64 pixels of the display can be left static by the Y position of the display for a status bar on vertical scrolling screens.
<br /> - The SAT (sprite attribute table) is convoluted in its layout for X and Pattern bits
<br /> - VRAM isn't fast enough to complete blit/transfer too. Care has to be taken for fast OUT commands (IIRC) on the real system.
<br /> - Sprite to sprite pixel collision (non transparent), but it doesn't tell you with ones.
<br /> - No autoincrement other than 1
<br />
<br /> Also, I hate how they extended the 'command word' function into the Genesis VDP. Stupidest method of selecting a VDP command ever. Ugh.
