		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Yes, but when you're working in smaller resolutions like this sprites generally look better with smaller head:body proportions. If you try to match the proportions of the concept art, you'll have to remove facial features and as a result, personality. There just isn't as much room for detail in 16x32 sprites like these.<br /><br />But with that being said, 1:2 body proportions are a personal preference. Shane's 1:4 body proportions and side profile are very remniscent of older NES games, so I think they fit the NES aesthetic much better. And I don't think they're that gritty, either. When I think of gritty sprites I think of 1:8 sprites like in Ninja Gaiden, Contra, Metal Gear, etc.

It's rare to see such artistic talent on indie projects like this. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /><br /><br />And yet...I think the pixel art designs could be a lot closer to the concept art. They're a little too serious. Maybe something like this, if it's not too late in development to change the designs?<br /><br /><img src="http://fc02.deviantart.net/fs70/f/2014/354/0/9/cowboy_and_girl_by_dragondeplatino-d8ak4x4.png" alt="Image" /><br /><br />Oh, and the WIP cave tileset is also coming along nicely...I like the texture of the door and the Western effect you achieved by banding the rocks like that. The background is just starving for some detail, though...why not fill it up with some single-colored rocks?</div><br />You can thank <a href="http://the-ez.deviantart.com/" class="postlink">http://the-ez.deviantart.com/</a> for bringing out that professionalism! Basically she was shown character concept art as well as the sprites, and from there she gave them the &quot;Wreck-it Ralph treatment.&quot; As for changing them majorly, it's unlikely since the games art style is already set in stone. Something overly cartoony could clash with the current level artwork. The deliberate aim is a medium between the Castlevania series and Super Mario Bros 2. <br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">DragonDePlatino wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">Hey, that's a pretty neat idea!

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />You could also try picking a darker shade of blue for those background elements, or touch up the player sprites so they're more colorful or varied. For comparison, take a look at Vice: Project Doom. Having different player palettes depending on the area you're in is also a good solution; SMB2 alternates between giving players a blue outline or a black outline depending on whether they're in a darker area or lighter area.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Hey its been awhile! The engine has been tweaked a lot and changes are still being made, mainly stress and lag related stuff. I've been doing more tile sets and recently went back to address the palette issue. The two main things I'm aiming for is the two players to have contrasting colors. The second thing was addressing Juanias skin color issue. Here's a test of that:<br /><br /><img src="https://40.media.tumblr.com/f7ba99f61b48ea69879e0f29cf8f72dd/tumblr_nmeljktjqM1s4ro4eo1_1280.png" alt="Image" /><br />I also played with the idea of them being pink and blue:<br /><img src="http://puu.sh/h1k9v/a3456629b0.png" alt="Image" /><br />A new tileset in the works:<br /><img src="http://puu.sh/h4bE2/7f2a372701.png" alt="Image" /><br />With this tile set, you can see a slighter greater push for the western style design within the game, mainly a bordertown between Latin America and Native America. <br /><br />Besides that, the main thing going on right now is making sure all of the connecting levels will work under stress tests and building up more levels. Once there's enough gimmicks programmed in, I'd like to make a teaser video (right now most of the levels are just empty levels without enemies or gimmicks).
