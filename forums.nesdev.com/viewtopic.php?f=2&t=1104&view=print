<br />Texture mapping, however, is almost certainly out of the question, as it would require far too much CPU time and PPU bandwidth to be feasible.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I was working on a raycaster a couple of months ago. The walls were meant to be textured, and I think there is enough time for that, with the specs I intended. I didn't get to the playable demo stage, there is no output to the screen yet. I got a little bored with that and am now working on a platform engine (it's more fun!), but may get back to the raycaster some time. I know it is not "texture mapping" in the most 3D sense (raycaster is fake 3D anyway) and the textures can not rotate, they're just distorted.
<br />
<br />This is what the engine was supposed to look like (it does, in the PC version not yet fully ported to the NES):
<br /><img src="http://www.nesstuff.kit.net/raycast.gif" alt="Image" />
<br /><img src="http://www.nesstuff.kit.net/raycast2.gif" alt="Image" />
<br />This shows only one texture, but I had many more, with 3 different colors of walls on screen at a time. It has a fairly low resolution of 28x64 "pixels" that can make the textures pretty unrecognizable from a certain distance. The textures are 1bpp (light and dark shade of the same color, using dithering), have a resolution of 8x16 pixels and are shaded for light and dark walls, as in wolfenstein 3D. I was targeting a framerate of 8 to 10 fps. Slow, but since it'd be a first in the NES it'd be OK.
<br />
<br />EDIT: added 1 more picture.

Right after is the attributte table for that name table, and it's 64 (8*8) bytes long. Each name table + attribute table pair is 1024 (960 + 64) bytes, or 1kb long. The NES has 2kb of VRAM, so we get 2 name tables and 2 attribute tables. If that's what you were asking.

<br />Trying things like this on the NES is not a waste of time. Sure you can do loads of things on the PSX but we want to do them on the NES. The whole point is not making flashy graphics but pushing the NES's capabilities to the limit.

<br />I agree on that point, but I don't think polygon drawing is very fair in this aera. While technically interesting, it most probably never would be reliable for a finished game or even a demo, unlike several other limitepushing tehcniques already discussed. Additionally, I really dislike polygon-based graphics, but effectively it becomes personall opinion here, so people may like.

<br />I feel it is just sad that people would rather stick to the mediocre that's already been done a thousand times than to dare and make something different and face some challenge. A nice isometric game is definatelly possible, you'll just have to think A LOT to come up with a good engine.
<br />
<br />I'm having the time of my life trying to code a fast platformer for the NES. Every once in a while I find myself screaming "Oh no! It's not possible to do this! I'm gonna kill myself!", just to find a solution for the problem a few minutes/hours later. I just need to think a lot about it. Some times I get ideas in the shower, in the bus, you know, the most weird places. That's where the best ideas come from. =)
<br />
<br />It was not easy to come up with the ideas used in the raycaster either. I managed to get rid of ALL divisions, and the multiplications left are very few and are mostly 8-bits. It was not easy to come up with a division-free raycaster. Look around, you'll not find any (that doesn't suffer from graphical glitches because of it, at least). I had many good ideas for this one and it would be a shame if I didn't finish it. I'm just not in the mood for it lately, as it would be just a demo. I'd like to finish a game.

<br />Well, WedNESday is always a bit short-tempred, don't mind him. But you have to understand it is not very easy for us either. OK, you're a newbie asking about something you don't understand, and there is nothing wrong about that. But the more experienced people in the list were already asked the same questions so many times, that it may not be easy to give a friendly answer.
<br />
<br />And most of the basic stuff is indeed written everywhere, it may just not be very clear the first few times you read. I read the basic documents many many times when I first started, and it was really hard to understand all that. But people shouldn't cry for help the first time something is unclear. Most of the times, if you re-read the stuff a few more times and really think about what you're reading it will come to you. If it doesn't, a little experimenting and/or observation will do the job.
<br />
<br />People here get mad when it's clear the newbie hasn't tried hard enough to understand what he's asking. But no one can read minds, and a hardworking newbie may get bashed for nothing. =)

I have pretty much the choise between seriously restric possiblilities by keeping two copy of each map, one in tiles and one in "real 3d", then make them match, or haing only 4 different textures that would fit all the BG pattern tables with height combinations, and would even need to use sprites to draw the field sometimes (I planned to use tile precision height, unlike your attemps in the other thread that use 2 tiles precision height).<br />So yeah, it sure is possible, but it is very limited. I haven't taken a definite abandon on making an isometric game on the NES, trough. I just conclued that MMC5's exgrafix is almost needed for something decent.
