I was hoping this was going to be easier to implement than writing it in software, and on the up side I would have more CPU cycles to work with.<br /><br />However, things aren't quite going as I had hoped.<br /><br />I got ahold of a oscilloscope and made sure that the crystal is working at the correct frequency. My address decoder is also working (74HC138) properly. I can only imagine that the problem lies with the Phi2, R/-W lines, converting them to -IOR, -IOW.<br /><br />I could try using a 6850 instead, as it was designed for use with the 68XX and 65XX series of chips, and has Phi2 and R/-W inputs.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=45">drk421</a> — Tue Sep 06, 2005 4:10 pm</p><hr />

Do you intend to take advantage of the UART's ability to receive while you're doing something else with the NES CPU?<br /><br />If you can live with occupying the NES CPU whenever a byte is being sent or received, you can implement a UART in software and use a very simple MAX232 level convertor tied to one of the I/O pins. Memblers posted a schematic a while back and I think still has some of the interface cables he made.<br /><br />I've implemented something similar that works well at 5.76 KB/sec. I'd be happy to provide my code and help with getting this working.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=17">blargg</a> — Tue Sep 06, 2005 2:52 pm</p><hr />

Ok, so I decided to put a 16450 UART into an NES.<br /><br />I'm having a bit of trouble getting it to work properly, and was wondering if someone could spot an error in my schematics. I built the thing already, tried initializing the UART and writing to it. So far no go.<br /><br />The basis of my design came off the C64, and I was assuming that it shares some similar bus architecture with the NES. Mainly concerning the control bus.<br /><br />First off, I'm assuming that M2 is like Phi2 on the C64? Where all address lines are valid on M2 logic high? Also, that PRG R/-W is also similar to that of the C64.<br /><br />Here are my schematics, please constructive criticism only, I'm rather frustrated at this point,<br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.54.org/condev/NESUART/">http://www.54.org/condev/NESUART/</a><!-- m --><br /><br />Thanks<br /><br />- drk421<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=45">drk421</a> — Tue Sep 06, 2005 10:29 am</p><hr />
