<br />
<br />what do people want then? I'm honestly curious. Do I find this the perfect format? no. Do I think it's better than every other NES alternative? Yes.
<br />
<br />Most of what I have heard is support for a legacy format, what other alternatives do you speak of? (not ines 2.0)

<br />Something that supports all games, not just an arbitrary subset.  Something that is easy for homebrewers to use.  Something that is easy to parse for simpler devices.  Something that actually preserves information like bootgod's database.  Something where you can add extra cart info like label scans or manual text.
<br />
<br />UNIF is many of those, ZapFC is none.  For all the things that ZapFC fails (like homebrews) the solution is to use iNES.  For all the things ZapFC succeeds iNES already does the same job.

<br />
<br />if you use an xml database (like NEStopia's, or the one I created for MESS), you get all of these except (2) and (3).
<br />
<br />if you use an xml database + you support a xml file included with the ROMs (and NEStopia already supports this latter addition), you get (2) as well, because creating an xml for an homebrew program is pretty easy (you specify the board, the prg and the chr and you are done)
<br />
<br />the hardest part is to handle parsing in a simple system like GBA, but still I haven't seen any other proposal capable of getting 4 out of 5 of your requirements.

<br />
<br />I'd agree if the standard was capable to represent all games, which iNES is not... at least iNES2.0 can improve this.
<br />however, it is still limited by the fact that new chinese dumps can use new variants to e.g. MMC3 and you would have to manually add them. 
<br />but this might hold true for the xml database as well, depending on the kind of variant.
<br />
<br />anyway, I really fail to see why you cannot accept that other people might have different opinions from yours. 
<br />do you think iNES is wonderful and that it's the answer to all your needs? ok. fine. just stick to it. I won't lose my sleep.
<br />OTOH, it's a few months that I keep adding split prg/chr to the MESS xml database whenever new chinese/russian dumps appear, or when a new proto is dumped, and I find it very easy and intuitive (much more than verifying if the iNES header chosen by the dumper is correct, when e.g. a new waixing dump appears and the graphics is completely messed up because it had been assigned mapper 4 even if it was not...)

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I have another question about this format. Sorry again if it has been addressed already; this thread has gotten pretty large. I did look over the readme, though.
<br />
<br />What if someone wants to run a non-split, headerless ROM (i.e. an iNES ROM without the header)? The file could be given the extension .fc, and should work in the same way that the split ROMs work. I tried loading such a file in QuickNES but that extension wasn't supported by the open dialog.
<br />
<br />EDIT: I guess this is to prevent ROM sites from bundling "downloadedfrom.txt" with the ROMs. Still, some people may prefer to load their ROMs this way.

<br />
<br />you would need to store the checksum of prg+chr too, in addition to those of the split file. I don't think the new format is supposed to work like this. for completeness sake, not even NEStopia or MESS xml support this (even if e.g. bootgod's xml does contain both checksums type...)

<br />Some games were mapper hacked even in the NES era, such as Contra (hacked to UNROM) and Castlevania (hacked to MMC5). This is because hacking these games to a Nintendo mapper was less expensive than getting a custom mapper approved by NOA and NOE. Other games were mapper hacked because they were originally released on a mapper that was too damn easy to pirate: Metroid, Zelda 1, Kid Icarus, and the game that became SMB2 (U).
<br />
<br />@mudlord: Game Boy has an internal header, much like Super NES. So is it in need of extra board information?
