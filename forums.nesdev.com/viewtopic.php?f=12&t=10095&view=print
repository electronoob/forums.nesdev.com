		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Does anybody know whether or not the MAD-1 toggles /CS on the SRAM for every address change, or does it just hold /CS low as long as the decoded address is in the SRAM region?  I'm in the process of picking up some old abandoned projects now that I have a bit more time on my hands, and one of them is trying to use FRAM in place of SRAM.  <a href="http://www.penguinet.net/TailChao/Extras/4MB8KBSNES/index.php" class="postlink">This guy</a> was able to successfully use the FM1608 FRAM chip, but all I've been able to get my hands on are FM1608-B and FM16W08, which *should* still be compatible, but they just don't work, and I've beaten my head against the wall for countless hours trying to determine why, but to no avail.  The only thing in the datasheet that really sticks out as &quot;this could be the problem&quot; is the fact that the Ramtron FRAM parts require a negative edge on the /CS line for every address change, unlike SRAM, which can change addresses any time that /CS is low.  I have access to oscilloscopes, but not in a place where I could easily hook up a Super Nintendo while I'm probing... though I suppose I could blindly mash buttons without a TV and hope for the best, though that's probably not going to work so well.  The only other difference I've found between the SRAM and FRAM is access times, which are only slightly different, and the overall cycle time is the same, just different setup/hold times.  So anyway, back to my original question, does anybody know for certain whether or not the SRAM /CS line gets toggled for every access?

In the case of LOROM /ROMSEL must be low to access SRAM.  I assume there's no way to keep /ROMSEL low from one cycle to the next.  Therefore the SRAM /CE line MUST toggle from one access the the next.  HIROM is a little less clear since /ROMSEL is high for SRAM accesses.  In HIROM /CE is low ANYTIME those truth table entires hold true.  So if NONE of those inputs change from one access to the next (which would seem possible but unlikely unless the CPU was operating from SRAM).<br /><br />To simply answer your question is would seem that LoROM's SRAM /CE MUST toggle for every cycle, but not necessarily with HiROM.  You'd have to confirm with the CPU opcodes, but I'd guess for typical load/stores from SRAM those inputs will change from one CPU cycle to the next making SRAM /CE cycle.  This might not be the case if the CPU was operating from SRAM though...

I'm glad to hear that it sounds like I was on the right track as far as the issue goes, and REALLY glad to hear that someone has gotten it working.  I'll have to look at it some more, but can it be done using only the signals routed to the SRAM pinout?  I'd love to make a nice drop-in replacement for original boards if possible.  If not, no big deal...

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Ok, so if I'm looking for a drop-in replacement module, I'd be using the correct memory size for the target board (64k or 256k... I don't have any 16k games worth the mod, but if I did, I'd just use a 64k chip and ground the upper address pins), so I don't need the AND gates on the address lines, only the glue logic on the /CE line.  In your schematic, you're using the 74..139, but if I'm using it on a MAD-1 cart, what is the signal on the MAD-1 that corresponds to Y3 on the 139?

That's a huge amount of static power dissipation, as well as rather horrific transient behavior. You're putting a huge amount of load on whatever's generating your /OE, /WE, and /CE inputs.
