<br />
<br />Just remember the color sizes for each format, and you can really shrink your images by a substantial margine. The main thing I wish I could get a grasp on is how to apply these kinds of conversions to my own programs to make my own progs that can convert from bmp to the NES graphic format. For the life of me, I can't figure out how to actually put this to use in VB.NET at all. I can do some minor stuff in it, but I simply CANNOT figure out how to do it in that language, or any other : P Graphic libraries are so confusing. 
<br />
<br />But whatever. I'm glad you like Irfanview, because I think it's an amazing program!

<br />
<br />Also thanks tokumaru for clarifying that :
<br />Real life images -&gt; JPEG is better
<br />Pixelised sprites/screenshot -&gt; PNG or GIF is better
<br />I guess PNG and GIF also allow for transparency, while JPEG doesn't. This is usefull when designing a website or something like that, so that you can paste sprites from NES game and keep the transparent color as transparent (altough I wouldn't say my website make a good usage of it).

<br />It's a very common name in video games. The main hero of all Breath of Fire games, and the recurent guy in Street Fighter series, are all called that. The hero of Bahamut Lagoon is also called that. Some dragon in Final Fantasy 5 is called that. You really can't call that name uncommon I've seen it hundreds of times (altough it's possible all those times are from games released later than the original NG).
<br />
<br />@Celius : Your upgraded portrait looks really awesome. It's like 100 times better thant he old version. Maybe you should add slightly more shading on the face, other than that it's really perfect.
<br />It's amazing how you became an amazing graphist since this summer. You'll have to tell me how you did that much progress. Now it's me who is going to ask you for help.

<br />That's because there isn't any! =) GIF and PNG are lossless (color reduction aside - not a problem if you have less than 256 colors) while JPEG is lossy.
<br />
<br />Roth, this program seems promising... your images are slightly smaller than the ones I got with Photoshop.

<br />
<br />I have been working recently on a tool in dot net to design maps for my future game.  I already decoded chr data to use it on the screen and should be able to save it back soon (I'm planning to integrate a chr editor too).
<br />
<br />You may have a harder time to do it in vb.net because it doesn't support shift operation on bits and you cannot do any unsafe code (if you want to edit the binary data like an array in C, which is a lot faster to do).  If I remember well from your previous posts I think you programmed in c++ before? If you did, I would suggest to do this part in C# if you have some chance, it will be a lot easier.  
<br />
<br />But if for some reason you can't, I could always give you the code I did and make the extra function for converting from a Bitmap class to chr data.  Since you can use compiled c# libraries in VB.NET that shouldn't be a problem.  If for some reason you really want to have all the code in VB, I could always try to port it.  I'm a little bit rusty in vb thought <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />  So I can help you in dot net if you want, ask me anytime.
<br />
<br />By the way Tokumaru, is your avatar coming from the game you're making at the moment? It look great. I would love to see some screen shots of your game someday.
<br />
<br />
<br />Edit: Roth, it may be possible to do it in VB.NET without the need of unsafe mode like C#. It's a little bit more tricky but doable.  And actually, you can do some bit shifting in vb.net since dot net 1.1.  I didn't use vb.net since 1.0 so I thought it was not possible.  I will give it a spin and let you know how it goes.

<br />Yeah, I've done some minor coding in C++, but nothing all that great. I can't do anything outside of command line programs, which really limits me. This is the reason I wanted to use VB.NET, but if there are no bitwise operations, I think I'll have to figure something else out :/  Thanks for the offer of giving me some code, but part of the fun is actually figuring it out, then applying it! What I could really use is some direction, honestly. I didn't realize there were no good ways to manipulate bits in VB, so now that gives me something to think about. Maybe I could look into Visual C++? I think I used to have a copy of that before, and maybe I still do... the free download one, that is. I can't recall what they officially name it. Thanks for letting me know about the bit stuff! Disheartening, but great to know : )

<br />To Nintendoize you can reduce to 4 colors, but Irfanwiew always peks me 4 brownish ugly colors. The best is to reduce to 8 colors or so and do the rest at hand, or to make the image grayscale before reducting so that there is less artifacts.

<br />I love that... Nintendoize! I'm using that term from now on : )
<br />
<br />With the color thing, yeah, it'll make some ugly colors. But usually that doesn't matter since you change the colors within the game, anyway. That grayscale method sounds pretty cool though, I'll definitely try that next time I do something similar!
<br />
<br />This also falls back to the program that I'd like to make. I'd love to have a prog that, when you import a bitmap, will first cut the picture into 8x8 tiles, and then convert each tile to four colors. When this happens, it would probably make the different colors... ummm... different from what you meant to make them, but then you can switch by hand in the tile editor. It could really help with the detail of images, though. Here's what I mean:
<br />
<br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v287/I_am_Roth/web_examples/avgn_nes_screenshot.jpg">http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v287/ ... enshot.jpg</a><!-- m -->
<br />
<br />That image would've came out much nicer looking if it was first chopped up in 8x8 tiles, then each tile gets 4 colors. I could've done it by hand, but that would be SO time consuming!

<br />
<br />I'm glad you like the word Nintendoize, Roth. I claim full rights to making it up! Well, at least I think I was the first to say it in a thread a while ago. If not, I guess I'm not the mastermind. That screenshot looks really cool! It reminds me of GameBoy Camera, which I still have!
<br />
<br />And Bregalad, I'm glad you like my picture so much! Well, this picture was originally a painting. The painting is crap right now, and I still have to fix it. All I really do is shrink the original image down to the appropriate size, trace a black outline over it, and work from there. And I also think long and hard about the palettes I use. These portraits are displayed one per screen, obviously. This portrait uses 2 BG palettes, and 1 sprite palette. But other than that, I just work on graphics when I'm in the right mood. This makes the images I make lots better. I'm glad to hear that someone thinks I'm a good Nintendoizer/graphic artist. It makes me believe more that my game won't turn out with pure garbage graphics.
<br />
<br />I remember when you first showed me the Nintendoization of those 2 FF7 songs, I was completely blown away, as they sounded awesome. When I compared the Mako theme to my version, I felt pretty bad, as mine was made like crap with NT2. Also, your Nintendoization of the Dragon Skill title screen I always thought was really good too.
<br />
<br />Games with above average animation? Batman Return of the Joker! That game has AMAZING graphics in parts. Sprites generally aren't as great as BG textures, as there are less colors to work with (in a sense).
<br />
<br />Now that I look back on it, lots of graphics in the CV games are really bad. There are lots of things that look really cool, but the moss in the games always looked bad to me.
<br />
<br />Oh, and Shinryu is the hardest enemy in FF5 (That means something like Death Dragon, right?), and it will do 8000+ damage if you're not careful. But there's also a "Ryu" I think.

<br />Sometimes it's hard to tell what a japanese name means without looking at the kanji, because many different ones are pronounced the same. In this case though, I don't think it means "Death Dragon", because "death" is "shi", not "shin", as far as I can remember. I think "shin" could mean "new" or "real", but don't take my word for it. It's been a while since I studied japanese, and it's not like I get a lot of chances to practice.
<br />
<br />EDIT: I was just thinking about what you said, and in fact there is a Shiryu in an anime I know, called Saint Seiya. Even in his case, the name doesn't mean "Death Dragon", I think it's "Purple Dragon". Again, don't take my word for it! =)

<br />This game has to be the NES game with best graphics ever. In my personal opinion, the versions made for the Genesis and Super NES manage to look worse than the NES version.
<br />
<br />I didn't find the game very fun though, so I resorted to passwords in order to appreciate the graphics of all levels. The first one is nice, but there's also a lot of cool stuff later in the game.

<br />Yes, Batman : Return of the Jocker is definitely the #1 of NES graphics as today. Maybe some homebrew game will kick it's ass in the future ?
<br />And the Super NES version was only a prototype, the game wasn't going to be released looking and sounding that bad. Because it's really horrible. Most likely Sunsoft did crap graphics and bad quality sound for testing their game engine, and after that they polish things so that the game is playable. Pretty much the exact opposite of what I do  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=":wink:" title="Wink" /> 
<br />Mega Man 5/6, Double Dragon 2/3 and more generally other recent games by Technos, Capcom and Sunsoft really have good graphics. Mardara also have great cutscenes, unfortunately I can't figure anything about the combat system.
<br />
<br />And yes, "Nintendoize" is Celius' word. I guess anyone is free to use it, as long as he didn't pay to get a (c) or a tm on it. I think my Nintendoization of FF7 songs could have been better. I have to work on it someday. Using MCK this make thing easier as well, because it's really easy to set up and use. Don't know why every one here prefers the crappy NT2 or FamiTracker <img src="./images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" alt=":(" title="Sad" />

<br />
<br />I stopped using FT and NT2 once I realized I really didn't know exactly how the engines worked. I also thought it'd be better to just write my own. They're good for starting out, but I agree that it's better to write your own engine.

<br />The great thing about Batman is that it creates the illusion of layered backgrounds, and it has completely awesome shading. Some of the barrels in the BG look completely real. I hope to make the BG textures in my game as good as these. Though I first have to worry about making the engine, which I'm progressing on!
<br />
<br />Oh, and about Nintendoize, yeah, everyone can say it, of course. The word makes so much sense, I don't know what else to say!

I can't do anything outside of command line programs, which really limits me. This is the reason I wanted to use VB.NET, but if there are no bitwise operations, I think I'll have to figure something else out :/ </div><br /><br />If you did some minor C++ then I would suggest to not jump on VB.NET unless your have a background in VB6. This is almost the only reason VB.NET exist: easier migration for VB6 coders to .NET (my opinion).<br /><br />As for bitwise operators, my mistake, they decided to integrate them since .NET 1.1.  If you happen to be using Visual Studio 2002 (.net 1.0) then you're out of luck.<br /><br />If you thought that VB.NET must be like VB6 which is easier to make RAD application, so is C#.  I would still suggest C# for your .NET needs. This is where Microsoft put most of it efforts since the beginning.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">Roth wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"> Thanks for the offer of giving me some code, but part of the fun is actually figuring it out, then applying it! What I could really use is some direction, honestly.</div><br /><br />No problem, always fun to figure out by yourself so I know how you feel. When I just need a solution (ex: creating tabbed document for my application) and I just want it to work, that's when I just use some existing components. In some case it is not worth to re-invent the wheel.<br /><br />Since I'm doing some research to figure out how to display thing properly in the 2.0 framework, I'm starting to know more about it.  So if you have some question, I may have searched for the same thing you're looking for, so you can ask me anytime.  Let just say the Bitmap related part of the framework is not as user friendly as some other parts.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">Roth wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"> I didn't realize there were no good ways to manipulate bits in VB, so now that gives me something to think about. Maybe I could look into Visual C++? I think I used to have a copy of that before, and maybe I still do... the free download one, that is. I can't recall what they officially name it. Thanks for letting me know about the bit stuff! Disheartening, but great to know : )</div>
<br />
<br />Sorry if I mislead you by the bit stuff, it really depends which you're using.
<br />For the free version of the compiler, you're talking about the Visual studio express editions <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/Express/" class="postlink">http://www.microsoft.com/Express/</a> .  They now have the one for 2008.
<br />
<br />If you don't have strong experience with Visual C++ and decide to do some .NET out of it,  let's just say that you will have a hard time. They changed 2 times the way you have to declare managed variables in so  I wouldn't be surprised if they change it again.  I would still suggest to try C# express 2008 and use select the framework 2.0 and should be more than happy with it.  
<br />
<br />I really starting to feel like a MS sale guy so I have to stop because I'm become sick just thinking about it <img src="./images/smilies/icon_lol.gif" alt=":lol:" title="Laughing" /> It is really up to you.  If you do some C# then I may be able to help you about Bitmap related thing.
