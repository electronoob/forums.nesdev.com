CHR-ROM games are manufactured with a ROM chip containing all the tiles the game is possibly going to need, while CHR-RAM games are manufactured with an empty RAM chip in place of that, and it's a task for the game program (contained in the PRG ROM) to fill that memory with tiles as the game runs.<br /><br />So, when backing up CHR-RAM games into ROM files, you only need the PRG ROM, because it contains the program and the data necessary to fill the (emulated) CHR-RAM chip with the tiles. Games with CHR-ROM must have the CHR data backed-up separately, and appended to the PRG ROM.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=95">tokumaru</a> — Wed May 16, 2007 6:08 pm</p><hr />

This means that the only real difference between the two is that PRG is visible via CPU addressing space (the normal $0000-FFFF address range), and CHR is visible via PPU addressing space (aka "VRAM" even though it's not always RAM -- the CPU can still access CHR via register $2007, but there is no direct access)<br /><br />Note that the above is the only real difference between PRG and CHR.  CHR is sometimes used for things other than character graphics.  Some games (which were short on PRG space), stored game data there (SMB1's title screen, for example).  Other games used CHR-ROM for additional Nametables.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"><br />2- A physical NES game has three chips on the PCB:  the PRG, the CHR, and the CIC.<br /></div><br /><br />Basically...yeah...  and an MMC (mapper) if present.  But there's no real <em>rule</em>.  Some games have multiple PRG chips.  Many others have an additional RAM chip and battery for SRAM.  And others just have RAM without a battery for extra work space. And even some have a PRG chip, RAM chip, CHR-ROM chip, CHR-RAM chip, CIC, and the mapper.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"><br />3- Not all games have a seperate CHR section.

Okay, I'm doing my homework here.  Do I have the following correct?<br /><br />1- An NES game consists of a PRG and a CHR file.  The PRG contains the game code, while the CHR contains the tiles used in the game's sprites.<br /><br />2- A physical NES game has three chips on the PCB:  the PRG, the CHR, and the CIC.  <br /><br />3- Not all games have a seperate CHR section.  Zelda is an example.  <br /><br />Okay, so I think I have all that correct.  If so, it should be possible to make a basic graphic hack of a given game just by changing only the CHR chip, right?<br /><br />Now, on the other hand, for those games that don't have a seperate CHR section, how do the physical carts still have three chips?  <br /><br />(Trying not to be TOO newbieish!)<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3321">godslabrat</a> — Wed May 16, 2007 5:15 pm</p><hr />
