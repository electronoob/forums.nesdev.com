		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" /><div class="quotetitle">Bregalad wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">Why do you have a fetish for legless people recently ?</div><br />Why do some artists have a fetish for people with animal heads and paws? Why does Nintendo have a fetish for men with mustaches wearing overalls?<br /><br />What happened was that I had previously been reading a fantasy novel with multiple races (elves, humans, dwarves, halflings, etc.), and I was trying to collect a list of fictional races from other works (Smurfs, Lilliputians, gnomes/kabouter, merpeople). During this time I found toys at a relative's house, and I decided to make up <a href="https://pineight.com/mw/index.php?title=Poli" class="postlink">a race that looked like those toys</a>, a race that could be mine to use with no fanwork bans interfering. Years later, I came up with an origin story paralleling that of Noah from the Bible: rising water levels force a small population to leave on a boat, and a mutation becomes fixed in the new population.<br /><br />My avatar is a mash-up of this race with the <a href="http://www.mediabistro.com/alltwitter/default-white-egg-avatar_b19650" class="postlink">avatar given to new users of Twitter</a>.<br /><br />In any case, Q is half right and half wrong. Yes, you got the toy brand right. No, the nick &quot;tepples&quot; is unrelated; as <a href="http://en.uncyclopedia.co/wiki/User:Tepples" class="postlink">my user page on Uncyclopedia implies</a>, it was generated by a Scheme program into which I fed character name phonotactics. People had been mispronouncing the nick I had used through most of college, which was leading to suicide jokes.

I was wondering about your interest in it too, and just figured it was a random interest, kinda like the random stuff <em>I</em> find fascinating.<br /><br />and I wouldn't have called it a &quot;fetish&quot;. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" />

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />And in my play time with NovaSquirrel's little sister several years ago, there was at times a racist rivalry between <a href="http://www.mattelfcu.org/img/pic_fp_littlepeople.jpg" class="postlink">Little People (Fisher-Price toy)</a> and <a href="http://0.tqn.com/y/couponing/1/S/F/6/417100E.jpg" class="postlink">Weebles (Playskool toy)</a>. The pegs to hold the Little People in place on their vehicles were explained DRM to keep Weebles from driving them. This may have in part influenced the rivalry between Nander and Polis that sets up <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/viewtopic.php?f=22&amp;t=10710" class="postlink">RHDE</a>.<br /><br />Two of the Little People characters from the 1998-2012 generation look a <em>lot</em> like <em>Smash Bros.</em> characters. <a href="http://pineight.com/mw/index.php?title=File:PK_Unzip.jpg" class="postlink">Eddie</a> is a dead ringer for Lucas, and <a href="http://www.megatoys.com.mx/little_people_michael.jpg" class="postlink">Michael</a> could be Dark Ness.<br /><br />In any case, open your Bible to <a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/9-45.htm" class="postlink">Mark 9:45</a> and tell me what you see.
