		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />BTW, for those considering buying a used Famicom (Bregalad this is for you) -- not the AV Famicom, but the original Famicom -- and <strong>assuming the product is known to work and comes with its original AC adapter</strong> -- this is how I see it / how my brain works:<br /><br />The Famicom was released to market (in Asia) in 1983.  Most Famicoms I've seen were manufactured between 1983 and 1987, so the hardware is quite old (not that it's broken, it's just old, so keep that in mind).  When the Famicom was released in Japan (1983), it sold for 14800 yen.  Taking inflation into account using <a href="http://www.measuringworth.com/japancompare/" class="postlink">this calculator</a>, and going purely off of the CPI (best choice, IMO, to consider what something would cost today vs. then for this type of product), we can see that 14800 yen then converts into about 17400 yen today.  17400 yen today is equal to US$217.<br /><br />Given that the product being sold is certainly used, and I personally feel/believe that moderate-to-heavily-used products should result in a 50% price decrease, that would make the &quot;going price&quot; around US$108.  So, any price around that, or less, would be a fair/reasonable price for a Famicom today.

So guess what his TV is?  Yep, Japanese.  It's a Sony Bravia KDL-32J5.  We're going through trying to figure out how to auto-scan VHF/UHF channels to see if it can find the Famicom when it's powered on.  :P  So what I'm saying is that using my neighbour's TV might not be a good/legitimate comparison test since it's a 100% native Japanese TV.  I <strong>am</strong> using the NES RF box with it though (I don't have the original Famicom RF box) so I guess we'll see what transpires.<br /><br />P.S. -- His wife let out a shriek of excitement and yelled out some word in Japanese which meant &quot;nostalgic!&quot; when I brought the Famicom over.  I guess she had one as a kid.  *laugh* Cute.  :-)

If you bought it used, it is possible that someone did soldering funk-music to the RF modulator for use on US NTSC televisions. <br /><br />As for whether or not the famicom is worth getting, I'd vouch that it totally is. Having stock mapper-audio capabilities is a very nice thing to have, and the famicom is a nice small shape. Mine is AV modded (and internal PSU modded, takes a regular IEC power plug in the back).

My Famicom's still sitting next door hooked up... Heh.</div><br />Spent about 30 minutes with my neighbours last night -- managed to find the stupid menu in the Bravia TV that let you auto-scan VHF/UHF channels (the menu was called something like &quot;Terrestrial Analog Scan&quot;).<br /><br />The results are in: my Famicom, hooked up to their TV (see previous post for details + model), using the NES RF box, is found on two channels: 10 and C31.  I don't know what &quot;C31&quot; is, but that's what the TV says.  The video quality on 10 is quite good (standard RF quality with some very slight vertical banding), while C31 is significantly worse (wavy video, etc.).<br /><br />My point here is this: my Famicom with the NES RF box works just fine on either a Japanese TV (channel 10 or C31), or a US TV (channel 3 or 4).  Don't know what else I can say.  The only other thing I could do would be to open up my Famicom and take photos of the insides for someone to compare to their own Famicom, to see if the unit I've had for 15-20 years is indeed somehow modified.<br /><br />An alternate theory -- maybe there are different revisions of those grey NES RF boxes, despite the model number always being the same (NES-003)?  As I said before, I have two of them (one that came with my top-loader NES, and one that came with my front-loader NES), but both are labelled NES-003.<br /><br />P.S. -- If anyone knows where I could get a replacement slider for the volume adjustment on Controller #2, that would be awesome.  Mine's buggered beyond belief (even when slid all the way off, it's usually on, and at max volume.  It's obviously worn out/broken/whatever and my current hack involves using scotch tape + cardboard to hold the slider in a very specific position.  ;-) )

Couple simple questions: 1) By dumping it, do you mean quite literally desoldering the slider/pot and placing the entire part inside of a small glass/jar/bowl of isopropyl alcohol?  2) What percentage isopropyl?  I can get my hands on 40%, 70%, and 99% (I have 99% in my bathroom presently).

That metal has two &quot;legs&quot; which slide across the two black &quot;strips&quot; you see in the upper left of the PCB.  The &quot;strips&quot; are wired individually -- one goes to a leg of a capacitor, and one goes to a pin on some chip.  The other leg of the capacitor goes to a trace that goes to one leg of the microphone, and has a resistor in-line (hard to explain in text, I could probably draw it in Paint though).<br /><br />So as far as what to clean, I'm not sure.  The &quot;strips&quot; don't appear to be any more or less tarnished than those in rainwarrior's shots, but I will admit the little metal &quot;legs&quot; look fairly tarnished, so I might let those sit in some isopropyl for a while.  The &quot;legs&quot; are incredibly fragile however; I tried bending one just to see if maybe it was pressed down too far or not pulled up far enough and it felt like it was going to break in half.  Yay almost-30-year-old hardware...<br /><br />Edit: Two things:<br /><br />1. I hooked the unit up to my TV with the 2nd controller open and mucked about with it.  The part that appears to be faulty is either the microphone, the resistor (unlikely), or the capacitor (also unlikely).  Strangely, if I hold the microphone between my index finger and thumb of my right hand, and then press my left hand's thumb against the two &quot;strips&quot; near the left side (which would be &quot;off&quot;), I can get the microphone noise to basically go away.  I think this would explain why in rainwarrior's post there's no microphone on his unit -- almost certainly because yes, the mics appear to go bad and cause all sorts of mayhem.<br /><br />2. I opened up the Famicom itself and then unscrewed the actual RF box from inside so I could look at it.  It <strong>does not</strong> look <a href="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3026/3023827066_fb2757bc65.jpg" class="postlink">like this</a> nor <a href="http://homepage2.nifty.com/musicplant/ph/fc8.gif" class="postlink">this</a> -- it looks newer than that, but not by much (I found Japanese food in mine, along with god knows what else).  I'd take a photo but I already closed the thing up (I can re-open it if need be).  Searching Google for &quot;ファミコン ビデオ&quot; turns up a lot of interesting results.  Ah, wait a minute: <a href="http://gamers-high.up.d.seesaa.net/gamers-high/image/kaizou01.jpg?d=a0" class="postlink">Here we go!</a>  Mine is basically the one on the left.  <a href="http://gamers-high.seesaa.net/article/124783020.html" class="postlink">Source page</a>, when translated roughly, indicates that the Famicom on the left is &quot;older&quot;, i.e. what mine is, while the one on the right (presumably similar to what rainwarrior has) is &quot;newer&quot;.  So yes, there is a difference between some of the Famicom's video/RF output circuitry, but done officially.  Possibly the &quot;newer&quot; models aren't compatible with the method I'm using.  *shrug*  koitsu's magically old Famicom.  ;)
