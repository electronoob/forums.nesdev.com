<br />How come some CF's work and some doesn't? Isn't CF a standard and they should all work the same?
<br />
<br />Can anyone recommend a good brand that do work?

<br />Most CF cards are standard, but there are definitely variations.  I even have a fake Sandisk card that can't do LBA, just CHS. Not sure how a mem card has heads!

<br />
<br />It looks like Windows is using the old dos/chs formats for anything 32MB or under.  
<br />
<br />01 = FAT12, definitely will not work
<br />04 = FAT16, but CHS mode.  The card would likely work anyways if you changed that byte to 06 or 0E.
<br />
<br />65 = ???  Could be error reading the first sector.  Not sure what would cause that but I can pay postage if you want to mail the card here.  Could also try holding down A when you turn power on then release after a few seconds.  That will do a software reset of the card.

<br />4GB? Isn't that enough for all existing roms a couple times over? Couldn't you accomplish it with 2GB?
