And to no surprise it's a generous subject for parody in retro-style games as well... for my own game, I've planned to include a humorous dude-in-distress backstory to parodize the theme.<br /><br />Looking forward to part 2 of this episode... anyone else here that does?

I think that the trope is overused, and that's where its problem lies. It wouldn't be a problem if only Mario/whatever game used it, but if game after game keeps using it, it starts to send a message. I also think it's lazy writing, and thats also how it can be fought. By establishing it as the clich√© it is, writers will have to find new ways to drive a story, and the problem should eventually solve itself.

The overly-animated titles are a clue that style is put over substance. It's presented as something objective, but it's got a constant dismissive tone to it. I wouldn't mind an opinion piece if it were presented as such.<br /><br />She also has this odd way of using a sophisticated word, then following it with an everyday word that means the same thing, which sounds pretentious and redundant.<br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">Welcome to our <em>multi-part</em> video <a href="http://www.dict.org/bin/Dict" class="postlink"><em>series</em></a><br /><br />This project will examine the <em>tropes</em>, <em>plot devices</em>, and <em>patterns</em><br /><br />...from a <a href="http://www.dict.org/bin/Dict?Strategy=*&amp;Form=Dict1&amp;Database=*&amp;Query=systemic" class="postlink"><em>systemic</em></a>, <em>big-picture</em> perspective<br /><br />This series will include critical analysis of many beloved games, but remember that it's <em>both</em> possible, and even necessary, to <em>simultaneously</em> enjoy media, <em>while also</em> being critical of its more <em>problematic</em>, or <em>pernicious</em>, aspects.</div><br />That's in the first two minutes.

Props for putting effort into production quality, but it does look like that's where a lot of thought went rather than the main point... <br /><span style="font-size: 50%; line-height: normal">That and I find it a little to take anyone seriously with massive hoop earrings</span>

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Wow, didn't expect to be that alone in appreciating the video. Looks like much of the dislike comes from it making too obvious points, which is fair enough criticism I guess. At the same time, it's sort of hard to please all crowds. Any lecturing material has to make a trade-off where some audiences will find it too academic, others too shallow. <br /><br />Like has already been pointed out, there's a ton of other material with more in-depth analysis around for people who enjoy spending hours of reading - and I do myself at times. But I personally found this video enjoyable because of being easily digestible, and putting effort into the presentation style, even if substance might have suffered a bit. Finally, the online hate campaign targeted against her just for the kickstarter trailer I see as kind of a testimony of the obvious points not always being so obvious to everyone.<br /><br />mikejmoffitt:<br />I personally think those massive hoops look pretty cool on her - kind of makes her look a bit like a videogame character herself ironically <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Sexism being more prevalent in Japan and the localized merchandise and character re-development is an interesting point to make and a matter worthy of mention. So this article is a nice read on its own, even if it smells a little of the that's-just-some-other-culture's-problem attitude in some parts.<br /><br />I don't really see why the author feels the need to present it as a rebuttal though, as it doesn't really invalidate any of Anita Sarkeesian's points. Her video was after all focused on looking at the video games of those times and not their contemporary merchandise (which was more often than not weakly connected to the games themselves). <br /><br />I have fond memories myself of reading the silly super mario comics and enjoyed the princess's character in them. (in contrast, the super mario land game boy stories were probably the most terrible example of video game comics ever) But fact is they were just that: some funny comics for the core Nintendo fans not really part of the super mario canon, and receiving little notice besides the games themselves. So it seems to me the author is doing a classic example of trying to prove someone wrong by sidetracking the discussion, pointing at a few edge cases and concluding that the problem doesn't exist because of that.
