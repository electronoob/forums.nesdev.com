The entire effort was driven by one single person at Canonical, Dustin Kirkland, who is a &quot;Product Manager&quot;, previously &quot;VP of Product&quot;.  Here are the details, you can read them if you so wish.  You will find that this developer &quot;screwed around&quot; in the process as well, making very bad decisions (engineering-wise) early on when trying to push this out, and end-users had to call him out on his bad choices (<a href="https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/base-files/+bug/1637800" class="postlink">here's the ticket</a>).

The OS itself does do a **ton** of &quot;phoning home&quot;, however, and disabling all of that is always something you have to do post-installation (i.e. it's already phoned home by the time you have the chance to remove it).  This has been a common &quot;WTF&quot; point for a very long time now.  And no, the installer DOES NOT ask you if you want to opt-out (unlike Debian's installer; FreeBSD also asks you this, but *defaults* to opt-out).  I could talk more about this, but here's a gist that shows it: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://gist.github.com/anonymous/fdc1cab8cb193ca19aa4c663c1ebd1f5#file-gistfile1-txt-L245">https://gist.github.com/anonymous/fdc1c ... 1-txt-L245</a><!-- m -->

Comparing dmesg is amusing; it's almost like... gasp... nobody actually tries doing it.  It's one of the first things I tried doing after having to upgrade systems to 16.04 LTS.<br /><br />As for Debian: if it's something you can reliably switch back to on Debian, then why does Devuan still exist?  *confused look*

It looks for packages that are no longer required by any package that has been manually installed and removes them. I assume Ubuntu keeps old versions of Linux around to let you revert to an old kernel from the boot menu if a new kernel fails to boot. In that case, the proper precautions would be as follows:<br /><br /><ul><li>Reboot before you autoremove, so that you know the newly installed kernel is a working one.</li><li>Read carefully the list of packages that it will remove, with your fingers on Ctrl+C, before you answer yes. If it offers to remove 20 lines of package names, your system might be in a semi-broken state. This might happen after you remove a PPA that includes newer versions of a package that Ubuntu's own repository also ships.</li></ul><br />Usually, when you <tt style="margin-left: 2px; margin-right: 2px; padding:3px; background-color: #3355aa; color: white;">sudo apt upgrade</tt>, APT will also suggest running an autoremove if it is needed.

I've been using Ubuntu for many years, and the few times I can remember it ever crashing was because I didn't have the computer set up yet for disc-swapping, and I ran my 6GB of RAM full.  (I sure wish firefox would improve their memory-allocation and fragmenting.)  That's not to say I'm totally happy with everything Ubuntu has been doing recently though.  It used to be I only had to re-start a couple of times a year (when updates required it), but lately they've been requiring it much more often.  They take entirely too lightly this matter of re-starting.  After it says I need to re-start to incorporate the new changes, it may be a week or two before I can wrap things up enough to do so.  There are a few other minor irritations, like when I click on a .pdf and it sometimes asks me if I want to open it with my text editor.
