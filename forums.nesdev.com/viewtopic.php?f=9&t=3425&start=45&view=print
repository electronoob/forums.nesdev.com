		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I have tested this on several consoles, and each one exhibits a different variety of glitches, ranging from very minor to very severe:
<br />
<br /><strong>Toaster NES 1 (serial # N12597170):</strong> severely corrupted graphics and screen layouts in both BIOS and games. Completely unplayable. However, I did get it to boot once, and aside from intermittent scanline corruption, it worked fine. (NOTE: this particular system has been pretty badly abused by its owner and his young relatives, which might have something to do with it.)
<br />
<br /><strong>Toaster NES 2 (serial # N3271679, CPU "G", PPU "G", MB "NES-CPU-08"):</strong> about half the sprites in all games show incorrect tiles (in SMB3, half of Mario looks like his map screen sprite). Otherwise playable.
<br />
<br /><strong>Toaster NES 3 (serial # N23193854, CPU "G", PPU "G", MB "NES-CPU-10"):</strong> the newest console of all those tested. Almost flawless. Only common bug noticed so far is background glitching in TMNT2, which has already been reported. <strong>This is the least-glitched PowerPak/NES combo.</strong>
<br />
<br /><strong>Toaster NES 4 (serial # N7962083, CPU "G", PPU "G", MB "NES-CPU-07"):</strong> same as toaster 3, except "Squashed (U) (Prototype).nes" exhibits sprite corruption (all sprites except player show some incorrect tiles). Probably affects other games as well, though I haven't tested that many yet.
<br />
<br /><strong>Toaster NES 5 (serial # N0948916, CPU "E", PPU "E", MB "NES-CPU-04"):</strong> a true relic! Works identically to toaster 3, except for a small flickering line right above the status bar on SMB3's map screen. (For those that are curious, PPU "E" shows a brown or purple screen at power-up instead of the usual white/grey. No other noticeable differences.)
<br />
<br /><strong>AV Famicom (serial # HN10735029):</strong> same as toaster 4, except with worse sprite corruption in Squashed (more corrupt sprites, several garbage sprites floating about the screen). I also have to power-cycle this one somewhat frequently to get rid of flickering horizontal lines in the graphics.
<br />
<br />Interestingly, all the glitches are completely graphics-related; none of the games ever crashed.
<br />
<br />[EDIT]
<br />Added some more consoles, as well as serial numbers and chip/board revisions.

<br />
<br />Bunnyboy, you posted in another thread that you have to connect the two ground pins in order to get a cartridge to work in a Famiclone.  Does the PowerPak PCB have the two grounds connected?  If not, I'm wondering if that may be the root cause of these graphical issues.

<br />CHR-ROM (or CHR-RAM, whichever is present on a cartridge) is connected to the PPU directly, so it has direct access to data in the CHR-ROM.  If the CPU (i.e. the program code) needs to read data from CHR-ROM, it has to go through the PPU registers ($2006 and $2007) to get the desired data.

<br />If that was the case, you'd be getting resets every second. The CIC(lone) only keeps your system from resetting, and has no impact on the game that's running.

<br />
<br />
<br />One mapper bug I've come across is the IRQ ctr for Skull &amp; Crossbones's mapper. I'm not sure if Shinobi is the same mapper, but that works fine though I don't think it uses IRQs.
