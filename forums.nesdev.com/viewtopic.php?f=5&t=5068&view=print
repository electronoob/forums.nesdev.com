		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />For those that still follow the serie, a demo of Final Fantasy XIII was made available in japan with the FFVII advent children complete bluray movie.
<br />
<br />I had a chance to play it.  If you didn't like the fighting system from XII (I'm one of those), you will be rejoiced to know that they changed it.  It feel a little bit like the older ones but completely real time, except it has been quite simplified a lot. 
<br />
<br />No more magic point, you have a gauge that fills up that allow you do to action. You chain some action up to three at the same time.  You don't have to wait for the gauge to be filled since it's separated in 3 parts so this mean you can launch between 1 to 3 actions depending on the status of it.
<br />
<br />The graphics are nice, I can't say anything about that.  It was quite simplified but I enjoyed it.  Anybody else had the chance to try it?

<br />I don't know much about 13 but it'll be released on 2 system I don't have and the heroes looks to really suck exept that red haired girl which looked cool. I'd be surprised if they would ever releasy any Final Fantasy game that is as good as the first 10 in the gameplay &amp; story departement (I don't care that much about graphics).
<br />
<br />Completely out of the subject but I heard there was another non-FF square RPG going on called The Last Remanant, and that it was actually quite good and is released for PCs. Has anyone got the chance to try this one ?

I cannot get used to the fighting system. The "gambit" thing, which you can configure what all you character do, feels like you're just "looking" at the game playing by itself. I don't like that, I want to at least interact a little bit.  I read that you can "play" the old way by inputting command but it too awkward. Maybe that now it became quite cheap I could always give it a second try but... hmmm..<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">Bregalad wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">I don't know much about 13 but it'll be released on 2 system I don't have and the heroes looks to really suck exept that red haired girl which looked cool.

I like FFX (except the leveling system), but for now it's hard to really judge properly FFXIII since it's only a demo and doesn't show much about leveling, usage of item, armor etc. From it first look, it seems like a quite simplified RPG but was still fun to play: but for how long if kept that way. I guess we will only know this winter.  After seeing the demo, I'm a little bit relief that is not FFXII all over again but still wait to see the real thing.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">Bregalad wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">Completely out of the subject but I heard there was another non-FF square RPG going on called The Last Remanant, and that it was actually quite good and is released for PCs.

<br />
<br />Heard about it but never had the chance to try it.  The reason it didn't come out on PS3 was because they started with xbox 360 dev and didn't go as well as they expected for the port.  So they did a port for the PC for that reason because in Japan you know.... Xbox 360... It doesn't sell at all.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Yeah the "battle system" of FF12 doesn't really have appeal and the game has basically nothing in commun with the first 10 titles which make me wonder why they even called it "Final Fantasy". It looks more like a spinoff of FF Tactics to me instead of a part of the main series (which is in my opinion dead since 2001 pas the release of FF10). Square keep releasing crappy remakes and one in a while a mediocre new game with awesome graphics.
<br />
<br />I have to say the FF12 is not an entierely crappy game it's playable and have really nice graphics (I especially like the optionnal "interlace filter" that you can enable, it is one of the only PS2 games I have that looks smooth on my old TV and that is not flickering). The music is not entierely bad altough it sounds more like FF Tactics to me. But still they artificially pasted the title "Final Fantasy" on this game, and make it like an offline MMO and I just don't like MMOs, even if they are ofline.
<br />
<br />Yet I have to admit that the automatic battle stuff is practical to read courses while playing at the same time.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Yeah, ever since Final Fantasy XI was online, and unbeatable, Final Fantasy has been officially dead. It's sad, after having beat Final Fantasy 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, Tactics, and Tactics Advance, but I guess it's okay, as 10 (well, 12) is a nice even and complete number. Sadly, games just aren't what they used to be. Everything's all XBox Live Gears of War crap, and Final Fantasy has gone techno-pop with a complete lack of nostalgia. I'm sorry, when you have to install games on your console and you have to be connected to the internet, it's really dumb. It takes away all the simplistic, isolated joy I had from playing games.
<br />
<br />Oh, but not all hope is lost! I still have to beat FF Mystic Quest (FF USA, I believe, in Japan). But I don't think I'll be getting a PS3 or any of the next gen consoles; I'll probably have to upgrade its graphics card or something in a couple of years  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /> .

<br />Do you also have something against Wii Shop Channel?
<br />
<br />I'll take an educated guess that a lot of players have shoved the MMORPG FFXI into their <a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisContinuity" class="postlink">personal discontinuity</a>. For them, the series goes IX, X, X2 (like Mega Man?), XII, XIII.

Just the fact that you have to have enough space to install a game, and if you don't you can't play the game is retarded.
<br />
<br />X-2, XII, and XIII are all part of my personal discontinuity list. Oh, and X-2 is the direct sequel to Final Fantasy X (X, of course, being 10). So X-2 is really Final Fantasy 10-2. Each installment of the FF series is unrelated, so they had to emphasize that X-2 continued the story of X.

<br />Well, on the original Playstation and on the PS2 if you don't have enought space on the memory card you can play the game but you can't save. Do you find that retarded ? At least saves are hadly ever lost as opposed to Nintendo cartridge based games. But again you can scratch discs, not carts.
<br />
<br />Yes FFXI is probably what marked the discontinuity. Among most FF fans, nobody played that, they all switched to this dumb Wow game and became no-lives, and now I'm the only FF fan arround  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" alt=":(" title="Sad" /> 
<br />Then again Celius, in order for you to say FFX2 sucks you'd first have to play it (borrow it don't buy it). You don't have to beat it, but in order to say something is bad it's logical you have to play it, even if pretty much everyone says so.
<br />
<br />Oh, and while FFX-2 and FF12 sucks because of their discontinuity and retardement as opposed to previous games, FF2 on the NES sucks even more because of it's horrible battle system and item/spell limitation system. Bad gameplay is worse than bad design after all.
<br />
<br />And Final Fantasy Mystic Quest is great, but it's really a spin-off, and have almost no story, and the battle system is more like Dragon Quest games. So if you have played all FFs, you may enjoy it less than I did when it was the second FF I've ever played (first being FF7).

<br />
<br />The first time I saw X-2 in japan I was like.. WTF?  Magical school girl thingy?... What did they smoke that day to make that game <img src="./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" />
<br />
<br />But if we go back on subject, FFXIII seems to get a little bit back on track, simple game play and interesting story so we may have some hope. The only thing that I'm a little bit annoyed is that you don't have any magic point so... What else will be missing.. The armor/weapons like in FF8? Only time will tell. But at the least the battle system is better than FFXII so there is some hope.  
<br />
<br />Now... What the hell will be that FFXIII versus.. There is a video on the demo disc and the graphics seems nice but there is no mention yet about the battle system/weapon/magic etc.  The graphics are more dark and that part I already like it. I guess we will know about that soon.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Now that's another things that seriously bothers me... Why do they kept making multiple versions/spinofs of the same game ? FFX-2 on itself would have been enough, but no there is that weird FF12 spin-off for the NDS and that FF-versus 13 that has been in developpement for 4 or 5 years yet absolutely nothing has been revealed about it ! Even I have been more advancing on my project that Square Enix during the same amount of time !  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" /> 
<br />
<br />Not to mention those horrible FF7 spin of recently made ! I have really serious hatred against them. They just noticead that no matter what crap they released, everyone were still talking about FF7 even 6 years after it's release that annoyed them and so they had to make that crappy Advent Children film and those dum sequels/prequels with incopatible stories with the original !! (FF7 being techincally the one who sold most copies worldwide according to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Best_selling_games" class="postlink">this</a>)
<br />
<br />Now I have nothing against spin-offs, seeing how awseome Final Fantasy Adventure, Final Fantasy Mysitic Quest and Final Fantasy Tactics are, but now when they release more spin-offs (with numbers in them) and simple remakes that are not enhanced than actual new games, and the actual new games are crappy, it really makes me turn against SE... exept maybe for the Dragon Quest seeries, because DQ8 really rocked a lot in my opinion.

<br />Yeah Final Fantasy becoming an online game was just a terrible idea. Thats the problem with online games, eventually they lose the popularity and the servers are all shutdown and you can no longer play them like you can an offline game.
