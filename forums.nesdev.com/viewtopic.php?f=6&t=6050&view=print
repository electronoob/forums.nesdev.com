<br />I use Famitracker and yes, I also use the Zxx effect on those.

<br />DPCM does not work that way. Think of a wave that can go from 0 to 63. Each 0 bit in the file means the wave steps down by 1; each 1 bit means it steps up by 1. There is a way to make an existing file louder, by repeating each bit, but you probably won't like it because it ends up twice the size and you have to play it an octave higher.

I do not really like to use those exact music instruments that were in the game, I rather want to use my own ones because I think they fit better. "The game" has very "thin" leads while my leads tend to have more "punch". I'm already making the leads as quiet as possible but it doesn't help as much. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /> <br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">tepples wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">I thought of editing the DPCM file with a hex-editor, but I don't know which hex values affect the volume.

<br />
<br />Size isn't a big deal (for now). I may want to try this out. So you mean all I do is copy the data of the soundfile and place every bit to it's respective "companion"?
<br />
<br />Like: F834 B730 FE94 turns into F834 F834 B730 B730 FE94 FE94

<br />
<br />Turns out Audacity is a better choice than Steinberg Wavelab. I have no clue why, I even exported from Wavelab with any setting possible (sample rates, bitrate, LAME &amp; Fraunhofer etc.), still bad DPCM samples. Audacity on the other hand got it right the first try. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />
