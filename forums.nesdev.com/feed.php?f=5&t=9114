Lots of cool information, but the translation is a little iffy in places.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"><br /><span style="color: green">I knew Roc ‘N Rope and Bionic Commando were similar, but I thought it was just because they were made by the same company.</span><br /></div><br /><br />is translated wrong, since Roc 'N Rope is by Konami and BC is by Capcom.<br /><br />More accurately, maybe something like this?<br /><br /><span style="color: green">I did feel at the time that Roc 'N Rope and Bionic Commando were similar, but I never realized the creators were the same.</span><br /><br />And not the translator's error perhaps, but the first CPS-1 game was Forgotten Worlds.  Ghouls &amp; Strider came after that.<br /><br />And correct me if I'm wrong, but the translation starts off with bold text for the interviewer, and plain text for the interviewee, but then partway through it all gets bolded...<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=355">ccovell</a> — Sun Jul 22, 2012 8:08 pm</p><hr />

A newly translated developer interview with Tokuro Fujiwara!<br /><br />The creator of Ghosts'n Goblins, Resident Evil, and other famous series discusses the first games he made upon joining Konami and Capcom in the 80's, as well as the background behind his more famous series.<br /><br />Did you know that...<br /><br />• Fujiwara didn't even realize Konami was a game company when he applied for a job?<br />• Ghosts'n Goblins' Red Arremers are named after a staffer called Toshio Arima? <br />• Back in the days when on-site testing of unfinished games was conducted in public arcades, a developer's biggest fear was competitors finding out and stealing their ideas, then releasing their own company's game ahead of the one they were copying?<br />• Resident Evil was originally going to use a 1st-person view?<br />• The opening movie for Resident Evil was made black and white because it was judged to be too scary?<br />• 20 years later, famed game developer Yoshiki Okamoto is still incensed that someone beat his file on the original Legend of Zelda while he was away on a business trip?<br /><br />Read all of this and more in The Man Who Made Ghosts'n Goblins!<br /><br /><a href="http://www.glitterberri.com/developer-interviews/tokuro-fujiwara/" class="postlink">http://www.glitterberri.com/developer-interviews/tokuro-fujiwara/</a><p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=5370">GlitterBerri</a> — Sun Jul 22, 2012 11:52 am</p><hr />
