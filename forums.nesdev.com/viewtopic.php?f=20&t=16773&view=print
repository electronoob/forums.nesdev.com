But let me stop you and say that if the tone is high pitched, it's likely some other kind of bug in your code. The value $01F4 written to NRx3 and NRx4 corresponds to about 85 Hz, or between E3 and F3 in pitch. This is a bass note, NOT a high pitched tone.

In this case, if the length counter was PREVIOUSLY disabled and now enabled and the length counter is not zero, it is decremented. If this decrement makes it zero and trigger is clear, the channel is disabled. On the CGB-02, the length counter only has to have been disabled before; the current length enable state doesn't matter. This breaks at least one game (Prehistorik Man), and was fixed on CGB-04 and CGB-05.&quot;<br /><br />But, I already had that logic.  From the register writes above, is this related?<br /><br />Edit: Also, you are correct that the tone is not high pitched as I suggested.  It just sounds very annoying, similar to a buzzer.

What am I interpreting incorrectly?</div><br /><br />Prehistorik Man probably uses the same sound engine as <em>The Blues Brothers: Jukebox Adventure</em> and <em>Little Indian in Big City</em> (both also by Titus). Many emulators seem to have trouble emulating this, because I remember that Jukebox Adventure sounded horribly wrong on a number of emulators (such as VisualBoyAdvance), similar to what is described here. However, it would sound correct on BGB. Another issue that many emulators have is that they don't get past the intro, showing an &quot;invalid opcode&quot; or something like that because they don't support the intro's impressive scrolling effect.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I had the exact same problem with my emulator.<br /><br />It is fixed via the effects described in the 'obscure behaviour' section here:<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">     &quot;Zombie&quot; mode: the volume can be manually altered while a channel is playing by writing to NRx2. Behavior depends on the old and new values of NRx2, and whether the envlope has stopped automatic updates. The CGB-02 and CGB-04 are the most consistent:<br /><br />        If the old envelope period was zero and the envelope is still doing automatic updates, volume is incremented by 1, otherwise if the envelope was in subtract mode, volume is incremented by 2.<br />        If the mode was changed (add to subtract or subtract to add), volume is set to 16-volume.<br />        Only the low 4 bits of volume are kept after the above operations.<br /><br />Other models behave differently, especially the DMG units which have crazy behavior in some cases. The only useful consistent behavior is using add mode with a period of zero in order to increment the volume by 1. That is, write $V8 to NRx2 to set the initial volume to V before triggering the channel, then write $08 to NRx2 to increment the volume as the sound plays (repeat 15 times to decrement the volume by 1). This allows manual volume control on all units tested. </div><br /><br />Gambatte implements this as so:<br /><br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">bool EnvelopeUnit::nr2Change(const unsigned newNr2) {<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;if (!(nr2 &amp; 7) &amp;&amp; counter != COUNTER_DISABLED)<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;++volume;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;else if (!(nr2 &amp; 8))<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;volume += 2;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;if ((nr2 ^ newNr2) &amp; 8)<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;volume = 0x10 - volume;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;volume &amp;= 0xF;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;nr2 = newNr2;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;return !(newNr2 &amp; 0xF8);<br />}</div><br /><br />Notice how the volume itself is directly effected by writes to NRx2 while playing.<br /><br />I'm not sure how physically realistic that is, or how it changes precisely between GB and CGB, but implementing that logic fixed the problem completely for me.
