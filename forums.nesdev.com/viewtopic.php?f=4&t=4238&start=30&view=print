<br />
<br />With the parts I have to use now, I'd say a bit less than 256kB because I'll need room for the intro and some other little stuff.  If it's a CHR-ROM design, I can free up some space with compression.  Did you have something in mind?
<br />
<br />GC#2 is 128kB in total and I'm not sure how much room is left (not totalled yet - but very little, I'm thinking), GC#3 should be 256kB.

<br />
<br />Certainly!  It is a multicart, essentially.  A periodical one, like a magazine without text (yet).  If I can put Hot Seat Harry (tho it is my own) in GC#1, it goes to show that I'll put probably anything on there.  Ideally, the series would eventually have every NES program finished since Mouser. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />
<br />
<br />If I can't fit it into GC#2, it might have to wait until #3.
<br />
<br />And yeah it definitely is fun to finish your first game.  After I started I don't even know how many projects and ideas, Hot Seat Harry was the first one I finished (can only do so much with 1kB).

<br />You can do this with a single 74HC00 quad NAND chip.
<br />
<br />By the way, I don't think I have mentionned this but Dragon Skill is using vertical mirroring (hardwired) and 32kb PRG, 32kb CHR, and is not going to be released in 2008 like I originally wanted to (I originally wanted it in 2007 actually....). I just tought I'd mention that.

<br />I remember reading a thread about simulating single screen mirroring with either H or V mirroring, (not sure, can't find it at the moment) so I can try and modify it to use one of those.
<br />
<br />So what type is the mirroring going to be hardwired to?

<br />It's looking like it will be horizontal mirroring.  Of the definitely confirmed games, only one is set to V - and it doesn't scroll.

Sorry but I tought I'd mention that, my scrolling engine heavily relies on vertical mirroring, as well as various effects done on title screen and between levels.
<br />The game isn't going to be released very soon (if I work hard maybe something like april 2009 would be possible) so maybe it would be for Garage Cart III anyways ?

<br />
<br />I moved to a bigger ROM and simpler mapper (32kB banks).  This also means I have more ROM space that's free, so I'm hoping some of you have some demos or something you'd like to see on the cartridge.  Or even another game.  There will be 100kB - 200kB free, lots of space.  If I don't fill it all soon I'll be burning it blank because I need to get this cart done.
<br />
<br />Also I wonder if anyone has any decent text compression for NES that's already developed.  And better compression for CHR besides RLE.
