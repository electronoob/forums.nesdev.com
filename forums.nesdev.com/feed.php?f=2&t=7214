I am in the middle of entering all of my bugs and feature ideas into a web-based bug tracking system (trac) that integrates with my revision control system (subversion).  I should have done this sooner.<br /><br />I find that having a granular todo list helps keep the momentum going.  I've got a private beta-tester who has given me some excellent feedback.<br /><br />I find that my development effort breaks down into four phases:<br /><br />1) Initial design and prototyping.  Lots of fun.  Can't stop coding.  I can't sleep at night because my mind is racing with what I want to code but haven't gotten to yet.<br /><br />2) Slow slog to getting a usable prototype that implements enough of the game that its worth playing.  This is where I tend to lose the most stream, as this phase is mostly grunt work.<br /><br />3) Beta-testing.  I now have a playable product, but it needs lots of bug fixes, tweaks and other enhancements.  This phase is both mundane and a bit exciting.  I can see the end, I have a playable product.  Momentum picks back up.  I just entered this phase with my NROM game-compo entry.<br /><br />4) "long tail".  You know the saying, "The last 10% takes 90% of the time".  Lots of grunt work, some boring.  It is easy to get burnt here and "take a break", but lose interest while away.  I have a great feeling that this won't happen this time around, as the compo is coming up (ob-bitch: Is it?)<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3664">clueless</a> — Sat Dec 04, 2010 12:10 am</p><hr />

I'm not sure how much planning is the healthy amount to make before coding. When I was younger, I wanted to see results fast, so I'd draw a shitload of sprites first and then make sure they were displayed on the screen as soon as possible. Note that I'm not even talking about the NES here, this was when I made games in QBasic. That approach did show results quickly, but eventually I couldn't get the program to evolve because of poor planning of the underlying architecture, so I would eventually give up on these projects.<br /><br />Nowadays, I plan a lot before anything else, and I don't start coding until I have at least 60% of the game aspects figured out (which means a lot of schematics, pseudo-code, and things like that). However, because of all the time I spend planning and implementing this basic architecture, it takes me a long time to see something actually move on the screen, so there isn't much motivation to go forward.<br /><br />If I ever find what the perfect balance is, I'll be sure to tell you guys! =)<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=95">tokumaru</a> — Fri Dec 03, 2010 12:53 pm</p><hr />

<div class="quotetitle">cartlemmy wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"><br />Managing one's time really is an important topic. I have maybe 4 to 8 hours a week to work on my homebrew. And the one thing that keeps me moving forward is a rather granular TODO list. I plan out all the next things to do, as  well as the bugs I need to squash. Also internal versioning helps as well. <br /><br />Does anyone do anything similar?<br /></div><br /><br />I'm happy this topic has come up because I've been doing this in an extremely limited situation and have never really realized how useful it would be to do it all the time.<br /><br />In the past, the times that I've used TODO lists and broken the TODO items into individual tasks is when I have been away from the computer.  I have a little notebook that I use to jot down ideas for my game.  Occasionally I find myself stuck somewhere with a lot of time and nothing to do and I'll pull it out and write 6502 code on paper.  Somehow this situation brings out the best of me.  Because I don't have the luxury of testing code real-time, I have to be meticulous in my planning.  I break everything I'm trying to do into small steps and I attack them one by one.  It's very systematic.  And efficient.<br /><br />On the computer my approach has usually been to dive right in.  I have a vague idea of what I want done ("make a status bar", "end the game when the timer runs out") and I jump in haphazardly without a real plan.  I can get things done this way, through trial and error, but the code isn't as good.  When I come across a bug my habit is to just try random "reasonable" changes until one of them works rather than thinking the problem through.   I think this approach leads to a lot of "rewrites" and "reorganization" of code I find myself doing every few months or so.  Vague goals lead to sloppy code, and they're procrastination's best friends too.<br /><br />Seeing you and Gradualore share your ideas about this has helped me realize what I've been (not) doing.  Today I spent 15 minutes and made a small task-based TODO list and it made a huge difference when I started coding (at the computer!).

Are you planning on creating your own music editor? I had considered this, but there are several mature and useful music tools out there like Famitracker. Famitracker even comes with a driver you can just stick in your game. I used this driver for a while but eventually found it a bit heavy weight for what I needed, plus I had a hack in place to play hand-written sound effects that was kind of clumsy. So, I eventually wrote a sound driver based on the Nerdy Nights sound tutorials (inspired by it, really), and made an addition to Famitracker that allows the addition of plugins that can export for different sound drivers. I've included an example exporter and driver  (the one I'm using in my game) for others to play with. See <a href="http://nesdev.com/bbs/viewtopic.php?t=6677" class="postlink">this thread</a>. It is in more or less alpha stage right now, but I know at least one person has been able to use it successfully for their project and another person who I think is heading towards using it <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" />.
