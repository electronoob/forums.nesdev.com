AT YOUR OWN RISK !!!</li></ul></span></strong><br /><br />That said (please excuse the rudely formatted warning above), I might add that I've tested the updater countless times on my revD PowerPak, with previous boot ROM versions of v1.02, v1.03B1, v2.00-beta1, and v2.00-beta2, and using various SNES console revisions (2/1/3 US unmodified, 2/1/3 1CHIP PAL, 1/1/1 SFC unmodified), each time with success.<br /><br />To initiate the updater, just copy the POWERPAK directory contained within the archive to your CF card, overwriting all (!) existing files in the process (while preserving the contents of your SAVES directory of course, if applicable). Once you power up your SNES PowerPak, you will be prompted to update (given that your setup meets the requirements). If you receive an error message, you'll have to revert back to your previous mapper set for now. If successful, your SNES will restart within seconds, showing the new PowerPak boot screen. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /> <br /><br />Don't forget to let me/us know if it worked! <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />So without further ado, here it is:<br /><br /><a href="http://www.manuloewe.de/snestuff/powerpak/preliminary_flash_updater.7z" class="postlink">http://www.manuloewe.de/snestuff/powerpak/preliminary_flash_updater.7z</a><br /><br />GOOD LUCK! <img src="./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /> <span style="color: #FF0000">(AND DON'T BLAME ME IF YOU BRICK YOUR VALUABLE POWERPAK !!!)</span>

Actually, that's the way e.g. sd2snes does it: Press A to play an SPC, and B to &quot;stop&quot; playing and return to the folder you were just browsing. Only a very brief screen flicker indicates at all that a cartridge-triggered console reset is involved.<br /><br />For similar convenience on the PowerPak, I'd probably have to change the software design completely (sigh) for maximum performance. The good thing is that I have an in-system flasher working now. So in theory, anything might be possible in the future. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" />

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />As for detecting a software-initiated reset, you need some flag that reliably is one value at power or after a normal reset, and some different value after a software-initiated reset. This could be some register on the cartridge, or RAM in the SNES matching some value that it's extremely unlikely to have normally. Then the boot code just needs to check this flag and restore where it was in the SPC playback. Main question is whether anyone wants to use their SNES as an SPC jukebox (with abrupt endings to songs, rather than fades).

This is not needed at all for casual PowerPak gaming, as explained in the readme file. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">In How To Use.txt, Ramsis wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">To install this unofficial SNES PowerPak firmware v2.00, you are required to perform two steps:<br /><br />1) Update your PowerPak's boot FlashROM chip with snes_powerpak_loader_v2.00.bin,<br />2) Replace the CF module files in the &quot;POWERPAK&quot; directory on your CF card with those from this release (whilst keeping your &quot;SAVES&quot; directory intact, of course).</div><br />Now however, since the beta version you likely downloaded is out of date, I would <strong>NOT</strong> recommend using it at all. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_exclaim.gif" alt=":!:" title="Exclamation" /> Your brand-new PowerPak's hardware revision might not even be compatible with the latest flash updater I've come up with either.<br /><br />So for now, I'd strongly advise you to use the <a href="http://www.retrousb.com/product_info.php?cPath=24&amp;products_id=84" class="postlink">officially available</a> firmware instead, and wait until a user-friendly solution becomes available -- if at all, that is (please don't forget that I'm doing all programming, and PowerPak research, in my free time while being reliant solely on my very own, first-run rev. D PowerPak to test everything). <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br /><img src="http://www.manuloewe.de/snestuff/powerpak/powerpak_vor_umbau.jpg" alt="Image" /><br /><br />BTW, should you be able to handle a screwdriver, it would be very helpful for me if you could post PCB pictures of your cart, or otherwise at least a picture of the closed shell (from both sides).<br /><br />In any case, have fun using your SNES PowerPak! <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />PS @SST39SF010 users: Chips are ordered, waiting for them to arrive. Wish me luck! <img src="./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" />
