		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Hello back guys 
<br />
<br />I just wanted to make a fresh topic so i don't get lost  
<br />
<br />
<br />Okay 
<br />Now i Took the Nrom 128 from a Excite bike cart
<br />
<br />I put 2 socket to it.
<br />
<br />+ i put the wire from the front to the back
<br />
<br />I got pics of it
<br />
<br />I think i did okay 
<br />
<br />But i Did wire it once on a bad pin &amp; it left a ''silver instead of gold on 2 pin...''
<br />
<br />the 2 pin before the 5th one (wich i solder)... 
<br />
<br />Im worried but its maybe just the gold part gone &amp; under it it's silver?
<br />
<br />Im wondering if it will affect the contact or not:S....
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />BTW :  is there a side where you need to put the eprom?
<br />or is it like the sockets theres none? 
<br />
<br />
<br /> here the pics 
<br />
<br />

<br />Well, there are indentations in those sockets (the small semi-circles that are "missing"), but it seems you ignored them! =) Not that it matters for the sockets, they're there just to help you place the chips correctly.
<br />
<br />According to your older pic (without the sockets), the indentations should be facing right. You installed the PRG socket correctly, but the CHR one is facing left. YOU DON'T HAVE TO DESOLDER THE SOCKETS AND SOLDER THEM AGAIN, just keep in mind that you soldered the socket facing the other way when inserting the CHR chip. When you do put the chips, make sure their indentations are facing right. Indentations on chips are usually small semi-circles.
<br />
<br />Since each pin has a different function, it is essential that they're all pin is in the correct hole.

<br />I am glad that i managed to do a good job on my first cart...

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />It looks like your CHR ROM is plugged in backwards - I'm pretty sure pin #1 should be facing AWAY from the cart edge (i.e. upper-right corner). Then again, it could be due to poor picture quality - take a close-up shot of the board and crop off the table and the rest of the cart shell.

<br />Sorry, but I can't tell from this picture which side the chips are facing. The top of the chips (the part with the small indentation) should be facing right (according to this picture). If they are, then that's correct.
<br />
<br />EDIT: If Quietust is right, you put the chips as you installed the sockets (the CHR one has the indentation to the left). Your chips should be like this:
<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">&nbsp;||||||||||||||&nbsp; &nbsp; ||||||||||||||<br />&nbsp;--------------&nbsp; &nbsp; --------------<br />|&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; |&nbsp; |&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; |<br />|&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;CHR&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; C&nbsp; |&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;PRG&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; C<br />|&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; |&nbsp; |&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; |<br />&nbsp;--------------&nbsp; &nbsp; --------------<br />&nbsp;||||||||||||||&nbsp; &nbsp; ||||||||||||||<br /></div>
<br />The "C" is the indentation that marks the top of the chip.

<br />Actually, no - the notches should be on the <strong>right</strong> - see the picture in <a href="http://nesdev.com/bbs/viewtopic.php?p=20715#20715" class="postlink">this</a> post.

<br />it has been 2 week.. 
<br />should be coming anytime soon.
<br />
<br />
<br />By the way forgot to State
<br />
<br />Is the CNROM games works on the Excitebike Dev cart i made? 
<br />
<br /> because i got a 52 games cart at home  that has
<br /> (muscle , legend of cage also on the same cart...&amp; they are CNROM ) just checking.
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br /> i did received my 32 pin flash Eprom 
<br />
<br />So i could start to prepare my  heavy shreddin MMC1 Cart 
<br />
<br />Put the 32 pin socket &amp; 1 -  28 pin socket
<br />
<br />but i was wondering  
<br />
<br />it's written on the board Nes sslrom - 05    U4MMC1
<br />
<br />Will i need to make Wire job  on that cart too aswell? 
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />big thanks to all you guys!

<br />Yes, you'll need to rewire, and a lot more wires than this NROM cart. You'll have to compare the pinout of your chip and the <a href="http://nesdev.com/NES%20ROM%20Pinouts.txt" class="postlink">pinout of the Nintendo ROMs</a> to see what doesn't match.
<br />
<br />I don't know what your Flash ROM is, but go to <a href="http://www.datasheetcatalog.com/" class="postlink">this page</a> and type in the name of your chip to get it's datasheet, which includes the pinout of the chip.
<br />
<br />The pins that don't match will have to be rewired, and there are probably a lot of them, so it will look much more like my UOROM cart than your NROM cart! =)
<br />
<br />If you have any doubts about the pins that don't match, just ask.

<br />Ill study those page with the little knowledge i got &amp; my broken english... grrr
<br />
<br />
<br />By the way toku!
<br />I understood for the chip
<br />
<br />so the original nintendo (28 pin on the MMC1 cart i should of let it there since it's like a transfer chip.?) 
<br />
<br />but i did pull it out... &amp; i think i broke a leg when i dropped it accidentally...
<br />so is it a blank Chip that goes there? or still i will copy something there? 
<br />
<br />
<br />will go read on the Wiring pattern that i will need to do  (to prepare myself mentally hehe)
