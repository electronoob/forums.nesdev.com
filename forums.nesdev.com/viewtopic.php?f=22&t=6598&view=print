		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Ice is really easy to do if your motion is based on acceleration (like Mario or MC Kids) instead of instant on/off velocity (like Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles 2).  Since there's normal deceleration when the player is on the ground, just decelerate more slowly if it's ice.  I guess the Mega Man games sort of had ice, didn't they...
<br />
<br />But acceleration-based motion is not how Battle Kid controls.  Designing good ice mechanics for the kind of motion seen in Battle Kid seems tricky, especially since it's going to be used for lethal platforming puzzles.
<br />
<br />Ice has both slow-to-accelerate, and slow-to-decelerate going for it, or slipperiness, or anything else you can think of.

<br />
<br />It's a mix of RLE or LZ.  In reality, RLE is the more likely one to get used.  Basically, if you have tile $01 and want to repeat it 10 times, you'd go:  $01,$FA...

<br />I'd do it with three colors in each palette: outline, text, and half outline half text.
<br /><a href="http://img39.imageshack.us/i/bk2logomockuplowcolor.png/" class="postlink"><img src="http://img39.imageshack.us/img39/7760/bk2logomockuplowcolor.png" alt="Image" /></a>
<br />
<br />If it's a mix of RLE and LZ, then it's LZ. RLE is the special case of LZ77/LZSS with distance one. I'll assume you mean "LZ77 where matches at distance one have a shorter encoding or longer maximum match length".

<br />
<br />Negative.  BK, past and future will always be the same formula.  I do, however, have some thoughts on another scrolling type game for a followup.  But we'll worry about that when the time comes.

<br />The "black flashing" transition seems harsh on the eyes. If you cannot keep the screen content, at the least if you could keep the status bar while the rest is updated would be already better. But this is my opinion only. Maybe other people don't mind as much as me.

<br />
<br />It should be about 2 frames faster this time around.  I really believe I've optimized it now.  BK1's just was too big a mess to re-write.

With some time between transitions (like the time it takes to walk through a whole screen) they weren't bad, but when I jumped to a new screen at the top just to fall back to the bottom one, the flashing almost gave me headaches.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">Sivak wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">It should be about 2 frames faster this time around.</div><br />Faster isn't necessarily better. In fact it might be worse...<br /><br />Since you have no scrolling, couldn't you try to render the new screen to the hidden name table, keep the old screen visible while that happens, and only switch to the new name table when it's ready? With unrolled loops it should be possible to draw a full name table in 4 VBlanks (that's pretty quick if you ask me), if you buffer the data in RAM beforehand instead of decompressing the maps directly to VRAM.<br /><br />You are probably gonna say no, but I had to suggest it because that's something that bothered me a lot in the first game.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">Astonish wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">Either jumping multiple times to get onto the next screen, or jumping too high and landing on a re-spawned enemy.</div>
<br />Exactly. The flashing was pretty annoying, but having enemies you killed a second ago being brought back to life was too.

<br />
<br />The thing with this is the new screen could conceivably be in ANY direction, left, right, up, or down.  It'd be impossible to tell what way for sure the player is going to go.
