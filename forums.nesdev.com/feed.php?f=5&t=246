I'd want Nintendulator ported to Linux (if only using Winelib) just in case I get a computer and peripherals capable of running Linux, so that I don't have to pay a $200 Windows tax to test my programs.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=9">tepples</a> — Wed Mar 30, 2005 12:53 pm</p><hr />

You want Nintendulator ported to Linux because you think the Linux port of FCE Ultra is inaccurate because the unofficial XBox port, which is based off an ancient codebase, fails to run many games?<p>Statistics: Posted by Guest — Wed Mar 30, 2005 11:18 am</p><hr />

I have heard great things about the accuracy of the Nintendulator NES emulator.  However, even though it is opensource, it only runs on one platform: MS Windows.  However, with no effort whatsoever it runs in Wine on Linux, by just double-clicking the executable after unzipping it into some directory on your harddrive.  However, sound didn't work at all.<br /><br />Under the non-free cedega, which used to be called WineX, which is a commercial fork of Wine optimized for gaming, Nintendulator runs correctly... if not slow.  My computer is a 1.8Ghz laptop, which I am running via a docking station.  With frameskip off (i.e. zero), I can only get around 30fps, and the sound stutters, which is probably due to the slowness of things.<br /><br />Up until now, I have mainly been using FCE Ultra on my Xbox... but it just isn't accurate enough for my tastes.  There are some games it can't even run correctly at all!  Anyway, I hope to see more from Nintendulator: continued improvements to the accuracy of its emulation as well as improvements to its usability for gamers... and maybe ports to other platforms such as Linux and the Xbox?  The Xbox port would require platform specific optimizations to get it to run at full speed, but the end result would be awesome!<br /><br />A Kevtendo would be even better, but it just doens't seem to be happening <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" alt=":(" title="Sad" /><p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=94">Jagasian</a> — Sat Mar 19, 2005 12:32 pm</p><hr />
