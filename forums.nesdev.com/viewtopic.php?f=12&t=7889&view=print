<br />Does that mean I could compile a rom, send it over to the cart by usb cable and run it? That would make debugging pretty quick.

Sorry. I hate this topic vs real hardware, of course it doesn't completely compare, but it's the best thing for development HANDS DOWN.
<br />
<br />As for flash carts, they might not be 100% compatible and even require donor parts from other games [SNES ones] but they're great.

<br />I think all of the stores linked to from krikzz's (the Everdrive developer) site are legit. I've ordered from kitch-bent in the past without any problems, for example.

<br />Can't really blame tepples for that misunderstanding since the question was posted under "NES Hardware and Flash Equipment" <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />

<br />I know of CopyNES but it doesn't work for someone like me with no electronics skills.

<br />
<br />I don't expect being able to do everything on a NES, as that would be silly. In a perfect world, I'd like something more akin to modern console development, like say the Xbox. Writing and compilation is done on the PC but the game is copied to the NES hardware and debugged there.
<br />
<br />I just wonder what the NES would need to be able to do just that part. And in such a way that is easy for someone with no electronics skills like me.
<br />
<br />And, I might as well ask for a pony <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />
