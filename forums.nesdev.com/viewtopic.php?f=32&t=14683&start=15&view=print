That wasn't intended, and I apologize if it sounded that way.  That being said, in my experience, they <em>don't</em> have to be retro game friends.  it's less about finding people who prefer one type of game to another (retro vs modern 3d games, gamers or not gamers), and more about managing a social event. Because I enjoy retro games, I'll plan a social event around playing some retro games. My friends will come for the fun and social interaction, not just because they like retro games (some do, some don't).   The harder part is just making friends at this age. It generally requires having a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_place" class="postlink">Third Place</a>.  Not having a car can make finding a Third Place harder, (I guess shunning of alcohol might as well, but most of my friends either drink very little, or are teetotalers -- it all depends on the nature of the crowd and the Third Place) and asperger's could make it harder to develop those friendships within the third place, I guess.<br /><br />Either way, there will be people for whom it will be difficult/impossible to find friends to play this game with.  They aren't my target market. I'm my own target market <img src="./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";-)" title="Wink" />

You'll need to increase the counters from 4 bits (each half of a '393) to 5 bits, use 74'153s instead of 74'157s, and add two shift registers.<br /><br />But it's pretty close.
