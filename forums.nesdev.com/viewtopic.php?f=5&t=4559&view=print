<br />"All there is to it"? I guess you aren't an audiophile then.
<br />Anyone remember the <a href="http://www.reghardware.co.uk/2007/03/06/fatman_itube/" class="postlink">iTube amplifier</a>? It converts digital output into analog.<span style="font-size: 59%; line-height: normal">plus it looked cool</span>  That thing ran about seven-hundred US dollars.
<br />Analog audio output Inferior... My Ass! 
<br />However Video output is by far a different story.

<br />Valve amplifiers add <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tube_sound" class="postlink">a characteristic distortion</a> to the audio signal. Some people find this distortion more pleasing than some of the mastering techniques used on recent popular music.

<br />It simply depends on how well the digital signal was converted by the DAC (and how well the speakers reproduce the waves.)  Basically.

<br />
<br />Well, what makes me laugh at the product is that people will be using it with badly compressed music (don't know the compression settings they use on iTune but I bet it is pretty low).
<br />If it was used with WAV files with CD quality or FLAC then fine, but most people probably carry around 128kpbs MP3 files.

<br />dXtr: That is an amusing point, hooking an iPod up to a $1000 sound system where the cymbals and such things sound like shit.  Of course, all this "iPod compatible!" everything advertised everywhere makes me cringe a little bit. "Wow, it has an input jack!".

<br />Before pocket audio players became common, a lot of car stereos and personal stereos had no input jack. One had to stick a cassette-shaped adapter into the tape deck <em>if</em> it had one of those.

<br />My car is a '96 and the (stock) stereo has an AUX input jack. Which i find amusing, because it has a cassette deck and a CD changer attached. The only consumer device i can think of that someone would have had 12 years ago would be Sony MiniDisc, or maybe those pocket voice tape recorders.

<br />Wouldn't it be funny if someone rigged a Mic to that, then run the output to a megaphone thing. Hilarious! it'd be some kind of public addressing  system.

<br /><strong>Edit:</strong>  Quoted for context. The post had nothing to do with the ITube.
