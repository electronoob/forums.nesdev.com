<br />
<br />And yeah I used to do that with NESticle too. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />

<br />That way you don't need the tracker to see it.

<br />With today's internet it's much easier to watch a video than to download and setup programs, specially if you only want to see this one thing and will never use the software again.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I'm guessing the "grow" sound was sequenced as shown, but I'd bet the "shrink/pipe" sound was done with hardware sweep.
<br />
<br />Comparison to homebrew: All the sound effects in LJ65 are sequenced, with columns for pitch (8 bits), duty (4 bits), and volume (4 bits). For example, the sound when a piece lands on the stack looks something like this:
<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">E-4 8 C<br />C-4 8 A<br />A-3 8 8<br />F#3 8 6<br />E-3 8 4<br />D-3 8 3<br />C#3 8 2<br />C-3 8 1<br /></div>
<br />
<br />Does this belong in NES Music?

<br />Sound effect from all games on systems not powerfull enough to play streamed effects are like this (altough sometimes with more effects on it like sweep).
<br />
<br />Personally I think the most crazy sound effects are from Super Castlevania IV. By taking SPC dumps, make it play a sound effect (modify the byte at 0x1F4 to do that) and slowing down the engine (change the byte at adress 0x1FA which control timer speed), I was able to see they are mostly done by crazy fast timpani or snare notes. Some are made with tone instruments, but the pitch changes so fast it don't sound like a tone when fast. My this is SO fasinating I can't express how much I love this stuff.
<br />
<br />Of course I love do sound effects for my own game as well, I type notes in and make them play very fast, and often get very un-expected results, sometimes I want to do a sound effect and end up doing another. By using hardwre sweep on the NES it's even more crazy, I can play very fast notes then a slow one, and fast notes again, going with lower volume, etc.. it sound awesome.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />As someone pointed out in the Youtube comments, the slowed down "grow" sound effect sounds eerily similar to the music that plays when you reach the flagpole at the end of a level. That's fun. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />
<br />
<br />Link's Awakening on the Gameboy has to be among my favorite games when it comes to sound effects. They are pretty amazing in that game.
