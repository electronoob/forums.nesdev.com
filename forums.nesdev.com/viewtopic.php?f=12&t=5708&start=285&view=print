The cartridge boots fine, seems to copy the selected game without too much trouble. But depending on the game, it either just freezes at some point (black screen) or the graphics glitch out badly.<br />I have tried with DMA on/off, tried formatting FAT16/32, tried using old mapper versions (though I went back to 1.04 afterwards) and nothing has fixed it.<br /><br />Lastly, It doesn't seem like the games always glitch at the same point. I can't tell if its time-related (heat?) or if the rom file has been miscopied. My SNES is a SNES Mini (aka Snes Jr.)<br /><br />Any ideas how to fix the problem? Thanks.<br /><br />Edit: Also tried using a Transcend 1gb and a Sandisk Extreme III CF card. The former wouldn't boot (FAT16/32 error even though it was in that format) and the latter gave me some weird error (Sectors Left = 1).</div><br />Which mappers are you using? Try the latest 1.04 mappers and see if that works. I know that some Sandisk cards have errors with the PowerPak. I've not been able to get my Sandisk Extreme III working. When I first got the PowerPak, none of my three CF cards worked, but after I upgraded to the 1.03 mappers, two out of my three cards have worked.</div>
<br />
<br />I upgraded to the 1.04 mappers before I plugged the snes powerpak in my nintendo for the first time. I tried the CF cards mentionned in my first post as well as a Sandisk Ultra II 4GB and a Lexar Platinum II 4GB and none worked. I went back to the 1.03 mappers, which made the Lexar card boot properly, but then the games would glitch really, really bad.
<br />
<br />Edit: I realise these are the 2 cards you got to work with mappers 1.03. Gotta wonder if my Snes console or powerpak are faulty.

Supposedly SNES mini support was added in 1.03 so it should work fine with those mappers. I don't have a SNES mini to test that though. If your PowerPak works on a full sized SNES, I would recommend getting one from eBay as they are relatively cheap.

<br />
<br />Right, I'll do that. One of my friends have to have a regular Snes around collecting dust that I could borrow.
<br />
<br />I'll let you know how that goes.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Update:
<br />My powerpak with its Dane-Elec 2GB card works perfectly on a regular SNES I borrowed (I believe its the SNS1001 board model).
<br />
<br />Here's something I ommited to say:
<br />I did a modding project on my snes mini (basically its a case-mod) meaning I had to relocate the 62pin cartridge socket. So there are a bunch of wires that are about 4 or 5 inches long between the board and the cartridge. This is the only thing that differentiates my own snes mini with non-modded ones.
<br />
<br />As far as I know, there are some few games that require very precise timing (such as Yoshi's Island) and wouldnt work on my modded snes. So could that be the reason my powerpak fails to work properly on my console? What's weird is that it plays really fine until about 5 to 10 minutes where graphics start to glitch..

<br />
<br />I would say that's definitely your problem as well. PowerPaks just seem to ride the bleeding edge of stability, to the point where even different revisions of the same console can affect compatibility. :\

<br />
<br />Thank you for the input.
<br />I am also using floppy cable wires. I guess I'll have to grab my soldering tools and figure out the maximal length of the wires and build my mod around that  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=":wink:" title="Wink" />

<br />Read online that that guy who runs dascheap.com has a lot of checkered past stuff tying him to fraud. I purchased mine from Videogamecentral.com. They've been around for years.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Hi @all.
<br />
<br />this is my first post on this forum. I read it since several month. Now i have a question relation the snes powerpak.
<br />
<br />Did i missed something, or is rregio patching not possible with the snes powerpak?
<br />
<br />Here is a link what i'm talking about&#058; <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.emulatronia.com/doctec/consolas/snes/sneskart.html#romprotection">http://www.emulatronia.com/doctec/conso ... protection</a><!-- m -->
<br />
<br />It's just because i can't play some games, esp. Secret of Mana (PAL) on my FC16 Go, just because i have an snes powerpak with PAL lockout.
<br />
<br />Is it possible in later mappers to add the ability to make an on the fly regio patch?
<br />
<br />In the myth forum someone already did this: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.neoflash.com/forum/index.php/topic,6042.0.html">http://www.neoflash.com/forum/index.php ... 042.0.html</a><!-- m -->
<br />
<br />b.regards!

The code I posted was intended to be used with the Neo2 Ultra Menu (the PC software used for putting ROMs on the cart). I may add on-the-fly patching to the menu at some point, although this will slow down ROM loading a bit.
<br />
<br />Your current option is to download SNESTool or some similar program and patch the ROM before you put it on your cart.

<br />But it would be a really great addition for myth ot powerpak. Just because we don't need a lockout chip or ciclone anymore.
