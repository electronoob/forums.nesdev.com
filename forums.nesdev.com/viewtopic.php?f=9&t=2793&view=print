<br />So now there is nothing preventing somebody from making a batch of NES cart kits: PCB, lockout chip clone, misc ICs, and a plastic shell.  There should no longer be a need to destroy classic hardware in order to make homebrew carts.  This is a good thing.

After you pay that it would only be ~$0.30-0.50 per cart but you would have to order at least 2000 at a time.  Assuming you can find 2000 people that would pay $3-4 just for the plastic case it would be totally possible...

Even if there would be some demand, I don't think more than ~50 persons in the world will be ready to buy a NES game for a medium price (~$20-$30) if they can just download it. I don't think it'd be fair to just keep any homebrew game secrete and sell it without offering the possibility to download it. I'd prefer having 500 persons playing my game without paying than 25 persons playing it with paying, personally.
<br />
<br />Now even if I'll be selling my games, I could just buy any bad game regardless of the board it's using and replace it with my own PCB that will always be the good one.
<br />
<br />The only remaining problem is that the source of bad games is fearly limited (while still a lot higher that a source of bad/common games with the board you want inside) and that I won't know what to do with all those stand-alone boards containing bad games.

<br />Since the NES has had a lot more sucess than Atari, theorically it's homebrew scene has chance to get a lot more sucess too.
<br />
<br />What about Color Dreams/Wisdom Tree/Camerica unlicenced cartridges ? Did they produce more than 2000 of each to rentabilize plastic case manufacturing ?
<br />
<br />NB : It would also be possible to grave cases in sone... but I don't think that would be very benefic in cost efficiencly.

<br />Companies like Colors Dreams would have made far more than 2000 of their games, cutting the price way down.  They were also selling their games for retail prices, something I doubt any NES homebrew so far would be able to do.

<br />Sure, and that's an easier thing to say than to do. Without counting that in 30-40 years, there will be no petrol, so no plastic.

<br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">but if diesel can be made from (renewable) vegetable oil, why can't plastics?</div>
<br />I think plastics are more important that diesel, at least to me. Imagine what life would be without any plastic. And even if rewenable oil would be made, the planet won't support it much longer I think. Plants are renewable if and only if you don't take more than there are new growing out. Less plant and more pertol means much much less oxygen and much more CO2, wich means end of the world.
<br />
<br />Well, I hope that.... not much of this will hapen.

<br />
<br />The only cases AtariAge makes are the custom ones, which (if I remember right) cost more.
<br />
<br />I really don't think it'd be a crime to disassemble a few hundred SMB/Duckhunt carts, or whichever, for parts.  The reason you see 'em for a buck or less is that there's tons of em.  I'm sure if a little homebrew industry popped up, the amount of cartridges sold would realisticly not even come close to putting a dent in the numbers of common nes carts.
<br />
<br />If there's somewhere in the neighborhood of 16million SMB1 carts out there in the world and you parted out 1000 for homebrew sales, you've only touched 0.00625%.. 
<br />
<br />In terms of numbers, I'm sure more carts get defaced, broken and/or thrown out in a year these days than you'd come close to touching with a homebrew market.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Well, yes, there are certainly a number of heavily mass-produced NES carts nobody would miss a few of, but as has been pointed out, a custom-made cartridge case could be much simpler - all it really needs is the four main sides, the bevels on the bottom corners, the four sides of the edge-protector portion, and some grasping point for removal - overall, not even remotely as complex as the standard case design. Not that I'm an expert on injection-molding, but that seems pretty uncomplex, and in my opinion a custom case would probably boost sales of any homebrew titles, since people won't see the all-too-familiar case and pasted-over label and think "oh, a couple of guys run this on the cheap out of their garage."
<br />
<br />Moreover, why would an injection mold cost so much to make? As I understand it (correct me if I'm wrong; as I said, I'm no expert on plastics,) it's just a piece of material with the case shape stamped into it and a small hole for the injection of plastic, coupled with another piece that provides the other side of the shape; sounds like something that could be made in a kiln, or shop class - not something I'd expect to go into the thousands of dollars.

<br /><div class="quotetitle">commodorejohn wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">Moreover, why would an injection mold cost so much to make?

The main part is the injection molding machine which has pressure of 20-100 tons to make sure the plastic makes it everywhere in the mold and so air bubbles are crushed.  To survive that the mold has to be solid aluminum which means you need a mill to make it.  Compared to making the mold and the time on the machine, the manual labor and materials cost is pretty much nothing.  The high minimum parts is simply because it takes a lot of time to set up and clean out the machines.  Each part only takes a second to inject so they dont want 15 minutes of setup then 3 minutes of usage.<br /><br />Making the NES cart more simple will help slightly, but the main factors in mold cost are size and number of big flat edges.    Cant change the size of the NES cart so the price will most likely be fixed.  Flat sides can more easily warp when the part is cooling so having some bumps doesnt increase the price.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">commodorejohn wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">oh, a couple of guys run this on the cheap out of their garage.</div>
<br />
<br />Yes there is a cheap way to do it if you dont have access to big machines.  Instead of injection you can do resin casting.  Basically you make the part you want, then put it in a box and fill the box with urethane or silicone.  Then you cut it open and take out your part.  Now you can pour a resin or epoxy into the mold.  It helps to have a vaccuum pump to take bubbles out of the resin and you have to pour carefully to fill everything.  Letting the part harden will take hours so you may want to make multiple molds.   The cost is far less (&lt;$50 to get started) but getting production quality parts is very hard.
<br />
<br />The coolest part about this way is you can easily find crystal clear resins.  I did this way a couple years ago to make clear case parts for the Apple Newton.  It took many many MANY molds and pours before I had any usable parts that were complete, dried hard instead of mushy, didnt have bubbles, and didnt have big lines were the mold was cut open.  Getting screw holes (dont even bother with threads) is hard so the NES cart would be easier if it was glued together.
<br />
<br />
<br />Another problem is what will the custom cart look like, and are there any games good enough to want one?  I am still thinking of making one for my PowerPak, but that cart wouldnt be usable for other people because of the slot for the CF card.  A custom cart would still need to fit the big boards, limiting what you can change.
