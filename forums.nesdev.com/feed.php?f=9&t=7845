<div class="quotetitle">ouso1999 wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"><br />these r the images of the console inside:<br /><br />&lt;snipped images&gt;<br /><br />sorry if the images are bad qualities.<br /></div><br /><br />Hmm, looks like gloptop city there.  The blob on the lower left is most likely the PRG, while the one on the lower right is the CHR.  The three DIP chips in the middle is the mapper, and the resistor, diode, capacitor on the lower left around the PRG glop is the reset detector, which detects when you reset the console, to reset the mapper and bring the menu back up.<br /><br />Dumping this would be fairly difficult but theoretically possible.  It'd be fairly easy to dump (all things considered) by cutting out the NES on a chip, but that will destroy it as a game console.  Then a cartridge header would have to be placed where the connector currently is.  This would allow it to be plugged into a copyNES for mapper probing and dumping.  It might be possible to just hold the NOAC in reset (which tristates the PRG bus, not sure about CHR bus) and wire it into a cartridge header as before and try to poke it with copynes or similar.<br /><br />Definitely a difficult and time intensive cartridge dump.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=230">kevtris</a> — Wed Jun 29, 2011 9:02 am</p><hr />
