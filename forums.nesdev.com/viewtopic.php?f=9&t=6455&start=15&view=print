<br />
<br />I've lately been changing power supplies out on various things, thinking about heat buildup. Most of the old game systems use linear regulators, so the higher the input voltage the more heat it dissipates. So I've been trying lower-voltage power supplies. One problem is that the rectifier for AC adds a voltage drop, and hence heat, that you don't need if you run it off DC. If you can get the loaded transformer output as close to around 7V as possible, you should have the least heat. Of course I run my NES with the top cover and RF shielding removed, so it has a lot of air flow. I suppose your pictures can tell us really how much heat the rectifier and regulator are giving off, as compared to the other components, to get an idea of how much you could remove if you somehow eliminated the former entirely.

<br />I do believe the originals are in fact png, but I guess my habit is to save pics as jpg after alterations. I'll go back and try to make a better one because I agree the end pic looked crappy on both sides.

<br />
<br />As a test of the device itself, if you just point it at the same objects when they've been off for hours, does it show a uniform temperature on all surfaces and materials? That'd pretty much confirm that it really is measuring heat and not the surface reflectivity or something incidental. It's still voodoo to me how this thing can measure temperature like that. I find it incredible, thus these attempts to make it credible. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />

<br />
<br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">I am not knowledgeable enough to how to fix this yet, but maybe someone will step up. The issue is now that I modified the power circuit, but still have the same 5.5mm x 2.1mm power port, it could easily be fried if someone hooked it up to an original NES a/c adapter! Origianlly you could hook up a cheap adapter that outputs DC to the NES-101 and it wouldn't hurt anything, but with this mod anything BUT 5vdc will damage something.</div>
<br />Yes, this was the problem I came to when I was considering using a 5VDC adaptor for a console-related thing, and removing its 7805 regulator. With the 7805 and a diode on input, the thing can withstand almost anything short of being hooked up to 120V via tha DC power connector. Without it, it's very susceptible to the wrong adaptor. My first Zip drive used a 5V power brick, and one time I accidentally hooked up a 9V one or something. Fried the drive, melted inside. You could probably put a voltage crowbar in there, which shorts to ground if the input exceeds the specified voltage.
<br />
<br />It seems the best would be to put a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buck-boost_converter" class="postlink">buck-type switching regulator</a>, like much networking gear has these days. They can accept something like 3V to 30V, and put out very little heat, since they very their current draw based on voltage. I wonder whether someone makes a small switching board with three terminals, for direct replacement of 78xx regulators. It'd have the filter capacitor, switching control IC, pass diode, and inductor all on a small board, with just the in, ground, and out terminals coming out the bottom.
<br />
<br />And like you mention, I imagine weight is one reason they've changed to switcher power bricks for devices these days. Shipping cost is significant, and the old-style transformers added significant weight compared to the device itself.

<br />You're not going to believe this! I just got a reply on another forum and he directed me to an <a href="http://cgi.ebay.com/3-Terminal-5V-1A-Switching-Voltage-Regulator-Power-Supp-/390106044649" class="postlink">ebay auction</a> with just what we're looking for - a direct 7805 switching regulator replacement! Excellent! I contacted the seller and asked him to check out the webpage on power research and see what he thought. Maybe he can help even further, he also may know how to integrate it better than just simply replacing the 7805, like remove this component and/or add this one...

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Very cool. If you put one of these in a NES, for example, you could then power it from from something like 3V to 40V. When powered by the original NES adaptor, it'd draw considerably less current, and thus generate less heat in the power supply as well as very little in the NES. You shouldn't need to remove any components, as these really are drop-in replacements. Leaving the rectifier in the NES, for example, allows AC or DC of either polarity to work. The rectifier probably doesn't generate much heat either. There's nothing keeping you from using a switching wall adaptor as well, further reducing power usage and shipping weight.
