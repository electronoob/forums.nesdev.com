		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Tomy of tototek sold me MGD and the cable for it.  If the price is right, he may make the FDSLoadr cables, but I dunno.
<br />
<br />I had to make my FDSLoadr cable because I couldn't find anyone either.  It was a pain because the instructions are difficult to understand, but I eventually got it.
<br />
<br />Sorry I can't help more!  How much are you willing to pay?  See most people won't make these because the payoff is not enough for the work involved.
<br />
<br />Personally, I wish a USB version was made.  The parallel one is a pain in the ass because I have to run it in pure DOS mode and it is very picky what machines it will work on.
<br />
<br />Hey, Bunny, how about it? <img src="./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" />

<br />
<br />Brad Taylor documented his findings pretty well, and I would like to see a USB version as well. I'm going to guess that a modern micro controller could handle 96khz (or whatever it was). 
<br />
<br />Has anyone thought about how this could be done with like a USB AVR or PIC?

I donâ€™t remember the directions but if I remember correctly all the fds loader cable is is a parallel cable and some wire on the other end. Anybody should be able to make one of those without much trouble, its not like its difficult soldering.
<br />
<br />I think your underestimating yourself a bit, assumeing you do not have touretts.

<br />I could build one, but like rbudrick said, between time, parts, and multiple shipments I imagine I would end up having to bill $60 to $100, which seems like a pretty expensive bit of work.  Also, I don't have an FDS.

<br />
<br />if you charged me $60 to $100, I would buy it. Unless there was an idiot proof guide on how to do it because I am terrible with schematics.

<br />
<br />This shows how most of the soldering will be (it seriously helps to have something/someone hold it steady).
<br /><a href="http://www.aeroelectric.com/articles/dsubs/d_solder.html" class="postlink">http://www.aeroelectric.com/articles/dsubs/d_solder.html</a>
<br />
<br />I figure a USB cable, spliced in, should be OK for a +5V source.
<br />
<br />If you want me to do it though, there's one snag - I'll need a RAM adapter cart and/or the cable it uses.  I could add an in-between connector to keep it usable for the RAM adapter still, but it may be kind of awkward.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Nevermind about needing a RAM cart, I went ahead and bought one since I've long wanted to build an FDSLoader RAM cart interface thing (now I'm hoping it'll work OK with a PAL Famiclone, heh).  Was $18, I was kinda surprised I found one right away.  But then again I guess a lot of people are probably trashing their disk drives instead of fixing them.
<br />
<br />So I'll have a spare disk connector if you need one, or I can build the adapter since I'll have the main part now.
