So they may have a purpose on the chip, but they aren't used on either MMX2 or MMX3.<br /><br />Edit: I've removed the chip from the PCB, and pins 74 and 75 are NOT internally connected to GND, so they are obviously not supply ground pins, they're probably inputs, but possibly I/O, and just tied to ground on the PCB.  I've changed them in the pinout list.<br /><br />Edit 2: Pin 61 is /IRQ.  Somehow missed that one during continuity testing.<br /><br />Edit 3: Despite what I said about /RCE1 being used as the only ROM /CE for a single-ROM board, Nintendo apparently decided instead to use /ROE as a /CE signal on RMX3/MMX3, and the ROM chip's /OE pin is just connected to Gnd.  Nonetheless, I can confirm that /RCE1 can be used as a /CE signal for a single ROM board, if /ROE is used for its intended purpose and connected to the ROM's /OE pin.<br /><br />If anybody has any more information, I'd really appreciate it.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Gazing at the PCB photo, pin 73+74 seem to be wired straight to GND, so they are probably normal supply GND. If you really wanted to, you could lift the pins, and check if they are interconnected inside of the chip. If they aren't, then one of them may be something special.<br /><br />And pin 75, looks as if one is supposed to cut the CL link, and to install the R4 resistor instead (which probably pulls pin 75 to VCC?). If you've some tool for dumping the cartridge, you could do some before/after test... maybe it maps it as HiROM instead of LoROM... or it makes the game 500 times faster :-)<br /><br />For the two ??? pins, maybe  SRAM select, and SRAM write? Since they are near ROM selects and ROM read accordingly.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />byuu, just thought I'd point out that pin 34 is not /WE like Charles MacDonald seemed to think.  At least, I can confirm on MMX3, it's connected to ROM A20.  So, I'm not sure if programming the ROM via the cart edge is even possible.  I'm still figuring out the various quirks of my logic analyzer, but I'll try to figure out those last 2 pins.  The assumption that they're SRAM control lines at least gives me something to go on.  If it turns out that it's not possible to perform writes to ROM, but we can figure out the SRAM control signals, would it maybe be feasible to wire in an SRAM module, burn a simple ROM that bootstraps to SRAM, then you could upload your code to the SRAM and run your tests that way?

But ... yes, I can do any reads and/or writes after the cart is inserted to get code onto the Cx4 to execute.<br /><br />I believe both nocash and Overload have successfully made their own Cx4 proto boards, so we might ask them for advice?<br /><br />Overload's board:<br /><img src="http://i.imgur.com/ZIHYrhc.png" alt="Image" /><br /><br />My guess is they were probably able to just reprogram the flash ROM directly, which isn't something I can easily do.

Myself, I would probably use ribbon cables to wire it to the CX4 ROM pins (and keep CX4 ROM installed, only deactivate it's /CE pin).<br />Byuu, no, I don't have any CX4 hardware.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">qwertymodo wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">And yes, it would be possible to just tie the ROM /WE directly to the cart /WE, I'll just have to do some tests to ensure that the data bus is active during writes to the ROM address space.</div><br />Ideally, you would full write access to ROM (via RD0..RD7 databus, and CX4 Pin51=/WE (or alternatly, less ideal, via SNES cart /WE)). Might be a 50% chance that Capcom has implemented it like that.<br /><br />If the databus is inactive during ROM writes would be a problem. But there should be a way around that: You could have /ROMCE1 (CX4.Pin26) ANDed with /SRAMCE (CX4.Pin25, presumably), and wire that to you FLASH/SRAM chip. Then you'd have full write access (to banks 70-77), and would get the same memory mirrored to ROM area (banks 00-07). That should work fine (unless you need more than 8 banks).<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">qwertymodo wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">As for the SRAM, 70-77:0000-7FFF gives 480KBytes addressable, right?</div><br />Could be also 256Kbytes (8 x 32K)... but not sure, I just woke up and didn't had much coffee yet.<br /><br />PS. no idea what CX4 Pin 61 could be intended for (if it does have any purpose at all).
