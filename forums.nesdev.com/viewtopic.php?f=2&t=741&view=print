However, most games will just map in the default banks and leave them as-is (though some do not, such as the Famicom RPG 'Lagrange Point').

Zelda then writes to $A000 setting the register to zero, thus mapping CHR bank 0 from $0000-1FFF (since bit 4 of $8000 is clear).  Again, not technically necessary since there's only one 8K bank, but it is still good programming practice to do so to avoid ambiguity.

However, I think it should be done when the mapper is reseted scince all official MMC1 games using CHRAM does this.

<br />But on a Famicom copier it does, the MMC1 games hacked for UOROM are so that the older 1987 Famicom copiers could play the games, without trainers or bankswitching registers, only a UOROM like state.

<br />So, I happened sometimes to forgot to press RESET while turning the power of on Zelda or Final Fantasy II, and I never happened to loose my saves. However, I happened to lose my saves in some SNES games, while they doesn't say to press the reset button, I still do it on my SNES now by precaution. However, Dragon Quest VI is the only SNES game as far I know to say to hold down the RESET button, I don't know why.

<br />A controller is needed to map SRAM into CPU$6000. If you're prototyping it out of discrete logic, then you may also have a few gates to spare for extra write protection upon power cycle. I seem to remember in <em>Nintendo Power</em>'s article about mappers that the MMC5 was the only MMC with robust power-down safety.
