From the <a href="http://kevtris.org/nes/nsfspec.txt" class="postlink">NSF Specifications</a><br /><br />NSF files have a header.<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">0008    2   WORD    &#40;lo/hi&#41; load address of data &#40;8000-FFFF&#41;<br />000a    2   WORD    &#40;lo/hi&#41; init address of data &#40;8000-FFFF&#41;<br />000c    2   WORD    &#40;lo/hi&#41; play address of data &#40;8000-FFFF&#41;<br /></div><br /><br />The "Load address" specifies where the first byte goes.  It is designed so that NSF creators can save space by eliminating unused portions before the music code or data.  But in reality, whenever it's not something like 8000 or C000, it's just plain evil.  It means you need to do a lot of math to figure out what address is where in the file.<br />The Init Address is what the game calls to select a tune to play, so the play code can be called later.<br />The Play Address is what the game calls every frame to update the music.<br /><br />Addresses are Least Significant Byte first, so an address of 801C would be 1C 80 in a hex editor.<br /><br />Usually, the Load address is 8000, so if you want to find a file address that corresponds to a NES memory address (like 8123), you subtract 8000, and add 80 for the NSF header, so you'd get 01A3 in the file.<br /><br />So let's say you want to kill the track selection code that was put onto an NSF rip.  Let's say it's blaster master...<br />Load address is 8000<br />Init address is 8013<br />Play address is 8077<br /><br />Load it up in FCEUX, set a breakpoint for 8013...<br />we see this...<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">00:8013:4C A0 BF  JMP $BFA0<br /></div><br />so it's jumping somewhere else (JMP instruction is like a GOTO)<br />Then we see this<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">03:BFA0:AA        TAX<br />03:BFA1:BD B0 BF  LDA $BFB0,X @ $BFB0 = #$54<br />03:BFA4:85 E9     STA $00E9 = #$00<br />03:BFA6:0A        ASL<br />03:BFA7:4C 16 80  JMP $8016<br /></div><br />This is the code that reads from the track remapping table.<br />TAX means Transfer A to X, it's like "X = A".<br />LDA $xxxx,X means A = what's what memory address xxxx + X.<br />There's also a STA $E9 in there for some reason, we'll leave that alone.<br />Then there's an ASL instruction, which multiplies A by 2.<br />Then it jumps back to 8016 (which is the address of the instruction right after that first jump)<br /><br />So if you want to get rid of the relevant code, you would change the three bytes at BFA1 from BD B0 BF to EA EA EA.  EA is the NOP instruction, which does nothing.<br /><br />NES Memory address BFA1 is located at 4021 in the NSF file.<br /><br />Note that after you take out the track remapping, the tracks may be in a strange order, some tracks are songs, some tracks are sound effects, etc.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=53">Dwedit</a> — Sat Nov 20, 2010 5:20 pm</p><hr />

NOP is a 6502 opcode. In a hex editor, in the code you type in one or more bytes that are EA. EA is the hexadecimal number for NOP.<br /><br />Look at the NSF spec for details on how to find the three addresses that you want to know and those are LOAD, INIT and PLAY.<br /><br />LOAD is the start of the program or music driver.<br /><br />INIT is the entry point to code where memory and data blocks are allocated and initialized.<br /><br />PLAY is the main core of the music driver and it is updated often. Usually updated everytime the NMI is called in a game.<br /><br />You can find the NSF spec at Kevin Horton's website <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.kevtris.org/">http://www.kevtris.org/</a><!-- m --> .<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=43">Gil-Galad</a> — Sat Nov 20, 2010 5:13 pm</p><hr />

If you want to unlock songs from the NSF, not only do you change the Number of Tracks byte, you also need to NOP out the code that selects track numbers from a table.<br /><br />You'll often see these soon after the Init code, something like<br /><br />TAX<br />LDA SomeTable,X<br /><br />Nop it out, and you can use the real track numbers rather than how the NSF creator decided to order the tracks.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=53">Dwedit</a> — Sat Nov 20, 2010 4:30 pm</p><hr />

Hm, well if I can get ahold of TNSE sometime, maybe I can get his permission to upload NSFTool.

If they didn't re-order it, the track order would be insane (lots of blank tracks inbetween, especially).  When I was ripping NSFs I tried to keep the sound effects in it as much as possible, and even re-ordered those, but I'm sure other rippers aimed to remove them (since they just wanted the music I guess).  Sometimes the sound effect routine is separate from the music routine, too.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=10">Memblers</a> — Sat Nov 20, 2010 4:27 pm</p><hr />

I even found some sounds that weren't used in the game. It's very helpful to have all the sounds from the whole game in an NSF because I sometimes play sound effects through NSF too. For example, in the Legend of Zelda NSF, it doesn't have the sound effect it plays when you find a secret. I try to use NSF to play sounds as much as possible because there's no quality loss and no addition to the filesize.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=4631">Exploding Rabbit</a> — Sat Nov 20, 2010 4:25 pm</p><hr />

Also, I might switch to the NSFe file format later because I'll want players to be able to choose which songs to put in their own levels and I'd like to have the track name listed in the game.

It might be worth changing the init address, to skip over the init routine added during the rip (and check all tracks 0-255).  It's seemed kinda common to have separate tracks with and without intros, etc.  But this type of stuff might be removed in the NSF rip as a duplicate.<br /><br />Save states in an NSF, that's a pretty cool hack.<br /><br />For an NSF optimizer, there actually was one but I can't find any trace of it online.  It was by TNSe (who made NESten), called NSFTool.  A google search turns up a much simpler NSF editor.  You would set the time length, it would emulate it for that time, so you could zero-out any memory that wasn't used.  When I made my SNES NSF player, this feature saved lots of memory and a huge deal of loading time.  Too bad it seems to have vanished, or maybe it was never on a website (from 2001 or so).<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=10">Memblers</a> — Sat Nov 20, 2010 12:37 am</p><hr />
