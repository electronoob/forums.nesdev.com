		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />This has been bugging me for a while...  Is there any particular reason why the majority of the members of our forum have not been taking advantage of the attachment feature of this message board and rely on ad-based and/or personal file-hosting resources?<br /><br />Also I'm not sure if I read the rules regarding the posting of dumped commercially licensed, unlicensed, or pirated binaries for development and hacking purposes on WhoaMan's hosting platform (as long as they fall into the development/hacking categories featured on our message board)...  Are they allowed or is everyone unsure and just refraining from attaching/uploading until further clarification?<br /><br />Regarding people not taking advantage of the file attachment feature, it doesn't seem &quot;posteritous&quot; to rely on your own file-host or commercial or ad-based file-host because of potential copyright-trolls, bandwidth limits, local or regional laws, and possible robots.txt limitations that prevent other spiderbots to map and backup files...  Your research, developments, and discoveries may not mean much to you then or at the moment, but given someone else's interests, your discoveries and development may save them the hours of your precious lifetime that you spent on your fulfilled, initiated, or abandoned possible achievements to lend to their successive branches of research and development; regardless of whether or not they publically contribute their successes to you.  <br /><br />The furthering of future generations depends on the past.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Ditto. I attach things here that I think will be single-version, but post links to things I might update. Outdated versions lingering around sometimes misleads someone from finding the current version.<br /><br />Perhaps a solution is to attach the current version to the post, and also link to the version on one's site. Others can attach newer versions to the thread if desired. Taking this further, ideally we'd archive everything people post on nesdev. One barrier is the inability to organize the files here or even list them, or filter out the less-significant things. Writing this I can imagine the kinds of tools that should be available for doing things like this effortlessly, e.g. &quot;Oh, someone uploaded a file, click, type 'tool to check bla bla' &lt;return&gt;&quot; and it's added to some repository without further effort.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />For one thing, phpBB 2 didn't support attachments at all. For another, a lot of boards like this are configured to hide attachments from anonymous visitors and unconfirmed accounts, to intentionally break inbound links to downloadable files on grounds of &quot;bandwidth theft&quot;, etc. NESdev currently isn't configured this way, but boards that are configured this way have spoiled the attachment feature for people who want to make downloadable files available to the public.<br /><br />I'm liking blargg's suggestion.
