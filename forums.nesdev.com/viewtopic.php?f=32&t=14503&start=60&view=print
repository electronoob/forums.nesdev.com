I also notice in the second stage &quot;bumps&quot; in the vertical scrolling now and then, almost like the scrolling is set too late, might be related to the same problem?<br /><br />Problem seems to occur in Nintendulator too (the vertical shake + the attribute corruption, specifically in stage 2).<br /></div><br />I can reproduce the attr artifacts and stuttering in Nintendulator and FCEUX 2.2.3 using the new PPU. But everything is gravy with the old PPU for me on 2.2.3. Well guess I will checkout the screen shake code and then after that the palette animation logic for waterfalls.....

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I discovered that the screen going gray when paused happens if i simply start fceux (again, 2.2.2). Selecting the old PPU fixes it for the duration of the session, and switching back doesn't retrig the problem. I'm half assuming the game is tickling a bug specific to that version of fceux?<br /><br />I also found that you can glitch through the left walls (including the invisible barrier far left) by dashing against them, as long as you've scrolled at least one tick. Glitching (dashing repeatedly) all the way through and wrapping around the screen offsets the object position relative to the collision map.

I didn't run into any of the glitches other folks have mentioned, thankfully. It did feel a little short, but I guess the prequel, and Demo on the title screen shoulda clued me in to that.<br /><br />Great entry.
