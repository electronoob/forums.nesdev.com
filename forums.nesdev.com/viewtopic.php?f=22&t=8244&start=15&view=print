<br />
<br />Ok cool. I thought I wasn't allowed to touch $2006 unless in vblank or with bg rendering off. That would have made things a lot easier.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />You can, but writing to it during rendering would be bad. [Earlier in the post somebody refferenced another that was "a bad joke," that's a great example of what NOT to do because that's what'll happen when you write to $2007 during rendering. Although writing to $2006 during rendering will also mess with the scroll too] You can disable rendering and write too. As long as your in VBlank you can write to nametables and everything, just switch to it once you write all the data over like 8 frames or something, then switch to it and go back to the other non-displayed nametable and change that. To see what I mean really well, tokumaru's raycasting demo is something you can see it work since it spans multiple frames.

<br />
<br />Yes, it runs. But it doesn't compensate for speed or resolution. However, it was accidentally run in that mode during the compo by the organizers so it apparently looks good enough. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":-)" title="Smile" />

<br />No, that's not possible (3gengames' "yeah" was not for this question). Even with 4 name tables you'd have only the time of the vertical blank to update them.
<br />
<br />I believe that the only mapper that allows you to modify a name table during rendering is the MMC5, when you use its dedicated 1KB of RAM as one. But the MMC5 is a bad choice if you ever plan to produce carts in quantity.

<br />
<br />Edit: I meant on NTSC.  I hear PAL doesn't clip anything.
