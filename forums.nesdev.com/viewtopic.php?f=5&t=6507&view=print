		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I can't think of any reason why "pushing the limits" have to be exclusive to just pushing the graphical limitations.  What about pushing the limits of fun?  Making the most fun game you can make for a particular system.  
<br />
<br />The graphics are there for the purpose of visual representation of game objects.  What if that object is a very long platform that is wobbling back and forth?  If the player is standing on a static platform, it's not nearly as fun as standing on a wobbling platform, since wobbling platforms can effect jumping and collision.  Since wobbling platforms take up more hardware resource than static platforms, then that is an example of pushing hardware to help out in gameplay.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I agree with you when you say pushing the limits doesn't have to mean graphical. This can also mean in terms of sound, but what "pushing the limits" really means is getting as much out of the system as you possibly can. For example, Super Mario Bros. 1 pushed NROM to its limits in my opinion. They got a lot of game play out of that 32 KB, and by no means was that game graphically impressive.
<br />
<br />But when I say I want to make a game that pushes the limits of the NES, I do heavily focus on the graphical and auditory aspects; I think they're very important limitations to work around with the NES. A game doesn't necessarily have to push these, but I think it makes for a more enjoyable experience when your game looks "slick". On the other hand, if your game is just pretty and isn't enjoyable, that's no good. One example of that would be Batman: Return of the Joker. Looks great, sounds great, but is pretty much no fun. I only play it because I drool over the graphics.

<br />
<br />I would agree that pushing the limits just means pushing the limits. The limit could be just what people think they are or be related to what the actual hardware limits are. But you don't have to push the limits to make a fun game which should be the top priority.
<br />
<br />I agree with Drag, the most important thing is to finish your project. Nothing is more impressive than a finished project. A technical demo or buggy incomplete beta is not as impressive as a finished product.

<br />
<br />I think Jump Bug was the first, in 1981.  A few others might fit the bill as well: Dragon Buster, Legend of Kage, a section of Jungle King.
<br />
<br />The point still stands though.  It's not as if scrolling platformers were the norm at that point.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I completely agree. Something amusing occurred to me lately: Namely that nobody ever looked for good graphics until video games. Sports never required graphics, board games never required graphics. I guess in games like Chess you might have a really basic cardboard playboard and plastic pieces with seams on them, or you might have a glass playboard and pieces made out of marble or something fancy---but it is still Chess, and still presents the exact same challenges and fun. I think the recent retro craze in video games has been a collective awakening to this fact: Games don't need great graphics to be fun, and companies are realizing if they devote too may resources to impressing their audience the gameplay may suffer as a result. Unless you're Shigeru Miyamoto (I'm thinking of Twilight Princess in particular, here).
<br />
<br />On the other hand though, I do agree with the comments made about making a game look slick. I love just LOOKING at Kirby's Adventure. Looking at Super Mario Bros. 1, while not unpleasant, doesn't make the word "beautiful" burst out of me like Kirby does. That said though, I would be happy to see some homebrews with SMB style graphics. I find nostalgia almost as appealing as beauty in many cases.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I disagree. Games NEED graphics to be fun - just compare how fun is a text-based-adventure RPG and an actual RPG with graphics. How many old crappy atari 2600 games are fun ? Okay some people will probably say the like them, but personally I don't like much any pre-NES games, and in fact it's one of the reason I love the NES - it's in my eyes the first system (ex-eaco with the C64) to ever have GOOD games.
<br />I know I will be flamed and burned for saying this, but it is my viewpoint anyways.
<br />
<br />It's wrong to say gameplay isn't related to graphics. A 3D game plays very differently from a 2D game. I like both and couldn't chose one over the other (although I like 2D better, but that don't mean I think all 3D games are bad).
<br />For example, in Super Castlevania IV, you have this rotating room in level 4, which exploits SNES' mode 7. If Konami made a NES version of the game, of course it would look and sound like the NES (which wouldn't be an issue), but that part with thre rotating room would have been technically impossible to do which IS an issue (it's just a random example).
<br />
<br />That being said I agree graphics aren't the ONLY thing - but better graphics CAN make a better game. However, like you say, if they invest everything on the graphics and don't care about the gameplay - this won't work.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I think that games in any platform can look good, even text-only games and Atari 2600 ones. IMO, the presentation of a game impresses when it's polished. That impresses me way more than resolution, colors and whatnot.
<br />
<br />When I play a game, I love to see well done screen transitions, for example. A smooth fade animation is billions of times better than a flickery transition with partially rendered screens.
<br />
<br />What I like to see is attention to detail, no matter how much detail the machine is actually capable of showing. As person interested in the technical side of things, I'll always be pleased to see that the programmer made good use of the tools that were given to him.

<br />
<br />Well when you put it that way, yeah, I guess at the time SMB1 was really impressive compared to non-scrolling games that came before it. It kind of set the standard for platforming games.
<br />
<br />I also kind of agree with Bregalad about games needing graphics, but I don't think quality of graphics is -that- important beyond a certain point. So long as I can tell what I'm looking at and it isn't annoying, I should be good to go. I am however talking about 2D. 3D is a different story. With PS1 graphics, I can usually tell what I'm looking at, but they always add a ton of detail to these super low-res textures that they put on crappy polygons; it looks terrible.
