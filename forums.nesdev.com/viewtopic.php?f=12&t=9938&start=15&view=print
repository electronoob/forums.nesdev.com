The music wouldn't finish at the same time if you finished the race in 1st place or 5th place because it took you a different amount of time to finish. When you see the sprite cross a time line or pic up an item the sound isn't delayed or at least does not appear to be in these videos. <br />Please explain this argument, for my curiosity and education.<br /></div><br />The music sync issue isn't much an issue during gameplay, partially because the player is usually concentrating on plying the game.  However the non-interactive bits are where this can become an issue.  Some may argue for example that the first 'hit' of the Corneria bgm is times to when the player gains control just as Fox calls in.  Other obvious issues include things like music being cut off too early.  The Starfox 2 segment of the first vid is full of these.  The music obviously sounds like it's building to a finish but gets cut off early.  It just doesn't sound right imo.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Yes we aren't talking about gameplay background music themes. We are talking about musical themes that play during events like in Star Fox, after you defeat the boss. Or in Star Fox 2 when the ships are launching from Great Fox/The Carrier Ship. Star Fox 1 has a very noticeable one, the launch of the Arwings from the hanger tunnel. In overclocked execution this theme is no where close to completed when it cuts out. <br /><br />It's not like it ruins everything, it's just one more point about how this is wrong. The best thing to do *once again* is to reprogram the game to render more frames so that the game moves at the same speed (music themes would be in sync) but thanks to additional frames being rendered you would have a smoother animation/frame rate. That would be cool.
