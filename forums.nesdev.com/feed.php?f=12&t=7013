Yeah I guess that post was a bit miselading.<br /><br />I know about that, it's just that I have no working system at all and I'd prefer an SFC above anything else (urrrghh, PAL).  I've done the EPROM socketing/soldering on neo geo carts so it should be familiar territory.  When I get my SFC and some SFX cart, I'll probably get into it.  I believe there's alot of messy rewiring involved though.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3295">smkd</a> — Fri Oct 08, 2010 9:03 am</p><hr />

An SFC alone isn't really enough to test SFC code, nor is a copier.<br /><br />The SFX chip sits <em>between</em> the cartridge bus and the ROM/RAM chips.<br /><br />To test SFX code, you will have to use a serial cable and stop-n-swap with an SFX game, and even then you will be limited to only using RAM to execute your code. Since RAM execution and the pixel caches fight each other, you'll get worse performance.<br /><br />In order to execute your own code through the SFX ROM path, you would have to solder your own EPROMs onto an SFX game board.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=375">byuu</a> — Fri Oct 08, 2010 7:25 am</p><hr />

About neogeo, while it can't rotate sprites, it does have direct access to 128Mbyte of sprite tiles.  The cons are being able to only shrink sprites and the 96 sprite/scanline limit will likely get in the way.  Pre-rotated frames at full zoom (possibly multiple sizes) will be extremely large all things considered.  Possibly prohibitively large.<br /><br />Interesting info about the GBA there.

The video really, really doesn't do the game justice.<br /><br />Placed properly in the context of its time, that was probably the most amazing arcade machine I've ever played. You sit inside of this box where everything else is pitch black, have this gigantic freaking monitor, and the entire booth rotates as you move your ship. It was extremely immersive.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"><br />emulators apparently used whole instructions as opposed to clock cycles and it was way, way off. I don't think the cache was even emulated either.<br /></div><br /><br />If you want to do something cool, I'd suggest trying to utilize the SFX2+SA-1 at the same time. Maybe even use MSU1 and treat the SPC700 as a math coprocessor :D<br /><br />Other emulators have not improved at all since then, and no, they don't emulate any of the caches.<br /><br />SuperFX has:<br />- 256-byte instruction cache with VERY complicated 16-byte row fetching<br />- instruction pipeline<br />- ROM buffer cache<br />- RAM buffer cache<br />- primary pixel cache<br />- secondary pixel cache<br />- high-speed multiplication mode for SFX1 only<br />- different memory AND cache speeds between SFX1/2<br />- ROM/RAM access control that can stall SFX at any point<br /><br />And all of that stuff is parallel. When you plot pixels, it fills the primary pixel cache. Once that pixel cache is filled or once you swap to another tile, it flushes it all over to the secondary cache and starts over.<br /><br />The part that even I don't emulate is something I've never understood. The secondary cache is supposed to run in parallel with the RAM buffer cache. Basically, when RAM is not being used, the secondary pixel cache can write to it. But when it is, the secondary cache stalls. And if that stalls out, it can eventually stall the primary cache as well.<br /><br />But when I emulate it, it causes timing issues in all kinds of games. And what happens if you are executing a tight loop directly out of RAM? Does the secondary cache stall forever, or does it interleave operations with the RAM buffer cache? Eg read one RAM buffer, write one secondary pixel, repeat. I have no idea.<br /><br />There's also the matter of incomplete tiles flushing the secondary cache. Games definitely do this all the time, and you don't get black garble, so it seems necessary that the secondary cache also has to READ from RAM, making the whole thing even more complicated.<br /><br />I'd say other SFX emulators have completely useless timing, and I've got it about 90% right. But both are really pitiful. If you write SFX2 timing-sensitive code and want to ensure it works, you have no choice but to find a way to run it on real hardware.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=375">byuu</a> — Thu Oct 07, 2010 11:12 am</p><hr />

The Neo Geo doesn't support real-time sprite rotation at all, so let's analyze the GBA. The GBA PPU has 1210 cycles per line to process sprite pixels. Each unscaled pixel costs one cycle, each scaled sprite costs 10, and each scaled pixel costs 2 cycles. So if you're using 32x32 pixel sprites, each sprite costs 10+32*2 = 74 cycles, and 16 will fit on a line. That's still 16*32/240=213% overdraw, twice as much as the <em>unscaled</em> overdraw close to 100% on Genesis and Super NES. The only time it'd overflow is when drawing those carrier-looking ships that use multiple layers for depth. (I can think of a few workarounds for that.) But the GBA OAM only holds 32 rotation matrices at once, and at some points on the screen, you'll need to upload replacement matrices. For these, you'll want to enable HDMA to OAM, which reduces the sprite rendering time to 954 cycles or 12 sprites on any line when it is active.<br /><br />The DS's 3D core can be used as 1,500 sprites, each with its own matrix.<br /><br />Back to the Super NES: The poster child for rotating and scaling quads on SNES is Yoshi's Island. Has anyone tried ripping out its sprite texturing code and benchmarking it?<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=9">tepples</a> — Thu Oct 07, 2010 7:43 am</p><hr />

I think it was TmEE who brought up that <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaLRLo2yB04" class="postlink">Galaxy Force</a> was ported to the Genesis at some point.  That's really surprising considering you'd need a coprocessor on the cart to get something that actually resembles the original arcade release.  After checking it out, it looks about as lame as I expected.<br /><br />I'm curious what other people here think about that scaled-sprite graphical style in the video.  If starfox ran at 20FPS using the graphical style seen in that vid, with a few less colors, would you find it nicer looking? The style might seem very dated to most, but I really like how the cave sections and fire stage turned out to name a few.  From a 1992/1993 marketting perspecitve the true 3D would likely be alot more appealing, but consider this in the present day.  What style do you find more appealing?<br /><br />The 21Mhz SFX should be able to do a decent amount of drawing since cache/ram/rom all have buses that can run in parallel, right? The 4bpp mode may make things kind of ugly and no where near as colorful as galaxy force.  8bpp may eat into the frame rate or borders, but I guess it's all about how you use your colors.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3295">smkd</a> — Wed Oct 06, 2010 10:06 pm</p><hr />
