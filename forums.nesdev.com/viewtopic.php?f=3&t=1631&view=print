<br />
<br />Er, no. I have a bad dump of SMB (the only copy I could find on the whole internet) which is just about the same dump that everyone has.

<br />Looks normal doesn't it? But it aint. If you set the 800h of RAM to FFh like on a real NES then it starts off on world 0-1 which is some kind of underworld level. It is a pirate copy, so the title screen can be decieving. So there are now at least three different versions. ershu's, mine and of course a good dump.

<br />Oh, I almost forgot that someone might be more willing to send an IPS patch that converts the pirate version to the standalone version, since it would still require that you have most of the data already.

<br />Nope. In the United States and other countries that have harmonized their laws to those of the United States, you can't sell the dumps even along with the Game Pak, as they're considered "adaptations" under 17 USC 117 because they're on a different medium even though they're bit-identical to the original data.

<br />Problematic from a legal standpoint, you mean? It really isn't that hard to find a good SMB dump.

<br />
<br />Since when have any of us given a damn about the law? All of our emulators are illegal and we've all downloaded about 10,000 ROMs off the internet.

<br />
<br />Wrong. If you write an emulator for the purpose of letting others play downloaded (or any illegal ROMs) then the emulator is illegal. Nintendo's own legal web page states so. And I doubt very much that anyone's includes a disclaimer that says 'legal ROMs only'. <em>Anything</em> that is made to be involved in criminal activities is illegal.

<br />Nintendo is biased. Nintendo states what it <em>wants</em> to be illegal. But in the United States, there's something called "substantial non-infringing use." For instance, VCRs may be used to mass-duplicate movies (obvious infringement), or they may be used to time-shift television programming (which the Supreme Court has labeled as fair use). Likewise, emulators are useful for 1. homebrew and 2. ROM images dumped with CopyNES. But if you <em>advertise</em> an emulator as useful with ROMs obtained through illegal means, then you're "inducing" infringement. The controlling case law is <em>Sony v. Universal</em> and <em>MGM v. Grokster</em>.
