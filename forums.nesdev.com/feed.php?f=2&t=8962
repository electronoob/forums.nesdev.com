Top part was fixed (stats), bottom part was scrolled left-right and up-down (rarely).<br /><br />I doubt that the problem was somewhere else, because vertical scroll worked in all emulators. It didn't work on the hardware only, and was removed.<br /><br />The <a href="http://shiru.untergrund.net/files/nes/lawn_mower.zip" class="postlink">ROM</a> and <a href="http://shiru.untergrund.net/files/src/lawn_mower_src.zip" class="postlink">source code</a> are available for an year now. It is not hidden. I lost the video, as I said two posts ago.<br /><br />Still, no need to solve this particular problem. I'm not going to change a game that was released long ago. I would like to have a working solution in case I'd need it in the future.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=4205">Shiru</a> — Sat Jun 02, 2012 8:42 pm</p><hr />

No need to answer to my problem. It was an year and many projects ago, so I have no idea what I was writing - something that I was told to in a forum thread, and that worked in all emulators. I guess if I had the hardware, I would find how to do it properly, by trial and error. But I didn't have the hardware, still don't have, and probably won't have - so it would be nice to have proper working code with all explainations how to use it without such problems, and/or emulators that show the same glitches as the HW.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=4205">Shiru</a> — Sat Jun 02, 2012 8:29 pm</p><hr />

Shiru: If the writes don't land in hblank, you get glitches like those in Super Mario Bros. 3: the fine X scroll might be out of sync with the rest of the scroll values. Or you might get shaking when the writes are applied before the critical time in one line and after in the next.<br /><br />The hblank time is short, but not too short. The portion of the scanline when the NES isn't rendering or fetching the background is dots 256 to 319. On NTSC, this is (319-256)/3 = 21 cycles long, and a typical sprite 0 spin wait has an uncertainty of 7 cycles. A DMC IRQ wait might have a few more cycles of uncertainty. Drag's pseudocode translates to the following code, which works with up to 15 cycles of uncertainty:<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">  lda last_PPUCTRL<br />  asl a<br />  asl a<br />  sta PPUADDR<br />  lda camera_y_lo<br />  sta PPUSCROLL<br />  asl a<br />  asl a<br />  and #$E0<br />  sta temp<br />  ldx camera_x_lo<br />  txa<br />  lsr a<br />  lsr a<br />  lsr a<br />  ora temp<br />  ; hblank needs to start before the LAST cycle of the next instruction<br />  stx PPUSCROLL<br />  sta PPUADDR<br /></div><br />It isn't too different from <a href="http://nesdev.com/bbs/viewtopic.php?p=64111#64111" class="postlink">tokumaru's code</a>, except tokumaru cleverly overlaps camera_x_lo with temp to save one byte of RAM at the cost of three cycles and two bytes of ROM.<br /><br />Dwedit: What do you mean? The version on the wiki uses EDCBA for affected bits and . for unaffected bits.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=9">tepples</a> — Sat Jun 02, 2012 12:00 pm</p><hr />

For a much simpler 2006/2005/2005/2006 trick explanation (since my previous wall-of-text may be intimidating):<br /><ul><li>Calculate a temporary value TEMP:<br /><ul><li>Take your Y scroll value, ASL twice, AND #$E0, and store it to TEMP.</li><li>Take your X scroll value, LSR three times, ORA with TEMP, and store it again.</li></ul></li><li>Select the nametable you want to display from (ASL'd twice), and write it to $2006.</li><li>Write your <strong>Y</strong> scroll value to $2005</li><li><em>&lt;wait for h-blank to start...&gt;</em></li><li>Write your <strong>X</strong> scroll value to $2005</li><li>Take your TEMP value and write it to $2006.</li></ul><br />Those last two writes need to occur in h-blank, which is why it's important to calculate that TEMP value beforehand, and <em>not</em> in between the last two writes. (Calculating this value may be a good way to wait for h-blank though!)<br /><br />If you don't care about <em>why</em> this method works, you can simply use this method as-is, and it should work. <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" /><br /><br />If $2006 confuses you, keep in mind, you <em>only</em> write addresses to $2006 when you want to read/write $2007 afterwards. If you're just playing with the scrolling, the value you write to $2006 is <em>not</em> going to be an address.<br /><br />If the backwards $2005 writes confuse you:<br />$2005 and $2006 are 16-bit registers; you need to write to them twice. However, they <em>share</em> the <em>same</em> latch that determines whether you're writing to the upper 8 bits, or the lower 8 bits. So, you're writing a high byte to $2006, but rather than writing a low byte to $2006, you're writing one to $2005 instead. And then the reverse happens, you write a high byte to $2005, and then you write a low byte to $2006.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=21">Drag</a> — Sat Jun 02, 2012 9:52 am</p><hr />
