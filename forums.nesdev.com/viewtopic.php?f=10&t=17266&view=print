		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Instead of making new threads every time I have a problem or something to ask, I decided to make a one thread that I post whenever I'm in need of help.<br /><br />After several years of not doing any NES stuff, I'm trying to remember things. I'm currently making the initialization code. The only functions if does is do the usual reset stuff, load the default palettes to the PPU and then turn rendering on. However, When I run the ROM, the backdrop color is desaturated red instead of black that I set it to. FCEUX's shows Pattern Tables, Palettes and Nametables as the default grey color when you open any of the PPU related tools. I have tried to debug this issue for quiet some time now and still can't find the cause for this. It's probably some really stupid mistake that I have just forgotten or something.<br /><br />Bonus question:<br />How does NESASM3's bank logic work? I followed a tutorial that showed a code where the banks were assigned in a particular way. It didn't really explain the banks other than saying that everything is arranged in 8 Kb (or 16 Kb) sized banks. If I rearrange the banks to contain something different (regardles of using the correct <tt style="margin-left: 2px; margin-right: 2px; padding:3px; background-color: #3355aa; color: white;">.org $----</tt> to set the proper address they need to be in ROM) the ROM just won't work. I'm assuming these banks are also used when doing bank switching, but for the sake of simplicity; how do they work on a ROM that has no mapper?<br /><br />EDIT: The attachment has my project source code so far as well as a compiled ROM.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Banks really are just 8KB segments in NESASM.<br />.bank 0 is the first 8KB of your ROM.<br />.bank 1 is the second 8KB of your ROM. <br />etc.<br /><br />The NES ROM format requires PRG banks to be first, CHR banks (if there are any) to be last. The 6502 requires vectors to be at $FFFA-$FFFF so it knows where to start running your code. <br /><br />One thing that's a bit of a gotcha is that the ROM header (.inesprg) specifies the number of SIXTEEN KB PRG banks.<br />So if that value is 1, you need .bank 0 and .bank 1. .bank 2 would be your first CHR bank.<br />If that value is 2, you need .bank 0, .bank 1, .bank 2, and .bank 3. .bank 4 would be your first CHR bank.<br /><br />If you are using no mapper, the order of your banks in the ROM file directly corresponds to their order in NES Memory. So the last PRG bank (either .bank 1 or .bank 3 depending on if you have one 16KB PRG bank for two) must have your vectors in its last six bytes. That's less about NESASM and more about NES.<br /><br />So as far as bank organization, you could totally put .bank 1 as it is before .bank 0 as it is in your file and it'd work. But you're still beholden to the 6502 vector rules. You can't only have .org $FFFA with your vectors in bank 0 because then it doesn't end up in the right place in NES memory. <br /><br /><br />Edit: To further explain that... .org helps your assembler make references. Say there's a label and a jump to that label:<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">.org $8000<br />label:<br />jmp label<br /></div><br />That would get assembled as jmp $8000. And.<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">.org $FFF0<br />label:<br />jmp label<br /></div><br />That would get assembled as jmp $FFF0<br />But that's really it. You could do this:<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">.bank 0<br />.org $8000<br />label:<br />jmp label<br />.bank 1<br />.org $8000<br />label2:<br />jmp label2<br /></div><br />Even though bank 1 is .org'd to $8000, that's actually not where the code will end up in memory. (Assuming no mapper.) Both jmp label2 and jmp label would go to label. (Because in a mapperless ROM, the first 8KB of your ROM file will get mapped to $8000. Bank 1 would get mapped to $A000... So label2 is REALLY $A000 and should have been .org'd that way so those jmps would make sense. That's similar to why a .org $FFFA wouldn't work in bank 0 (in a mapper less ROM.) It still doesn't end up in $FFFA in NES memory.<br /><br />And you might wonder why the assembler can't do it automatically... and the reason is because mappers can sort of put any part of the ROM anywhere. Bank 0 and bank 1 could BOTH be designed to be at $8000. (Though not at the same time)<br /><br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">ldx #$7F;Why $7F and not $FF?<br />stx stack_ptr<br />txs<br /></div><br /><br />You've got some subtle problems. This never writes $FC to $0200:<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">MemoryClear:<br />&nbsp;ldx #$FF<br />&nbsp;lda #$FC<br /><br />MemLoop1:<br />&nbsp;sta $0200,x<br />&nbsp;dex<br />&nbsp;cpx #$00<br />&nbsp;bne MemLoop1<br /></div><br />At MemLoop1, imagine X is 1. sta $0200,x will make $0201 equal to $FC. Dex. X is 0. 0 is equal to 0, so we don't branch again. So an sta $0200,x where x was zero never happens.<br />You (usually) don't need to do a comparison with zero, because the zero flag is set/cleared by most instructions.<br /><br />This would do the same thing (in this context):<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">MemoryClear:<br />&nbsp;ldx #$FF<br />&nbsp;lda #$FC<br /><br />MemLoop1:<br />&nbsp;sta $0200,x<br />&nbsp;dex<br />&nbsp;bne MemLoop1<br /></div><br />But that still missed zero. Instead, start with zero and count up. Getting back to zero will still break the loop, but that's fine since you did zero at the start before any conditional branch check:<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">MemoryClear:<br />&nbsp;ldx #$0<br />&nbsp;lda #$FC<br /><br />MemLoop1:<br />&nbsp;sta $0200,x<br />&nbsp;inx<br />&nbsp;bne MemLoop1<br /></div><br />The same problems are in your second clear memory loop.

I probably need some simple example to help me getting started and then possibly edit to fit my needs better.<br /><br />Edit: A couple of ways that came in mind for this:<br />1. Subtract <tt style="margin-left: 2px; margin-right: 2px; padding:3px; background-color: #3355aa; color: white;">#$10</tt> from the color (or <tt style="margin-left: 2px; margin-right: 2px; padding:3px; background-color: #3355aa; color: white;">#$20</tt> if original color is<tt style="margin-left: 2px; margin-right: 2px; padding:3px; background-color: #3355aa; color: white;">#$3x</tt>). If result sets the negative flag, then color is set to <tt style="margin-left: 2px; margin-right: 2px; padding:3px; background-color: #3355aa; color: white;">#$0F</tt>. Fading in might be a bit harder since the fader would have to know what color to fade to.<br /><br />2. I guess a bit easier, but more space consuming would be to have pre-made fade palettes and use indices to figure which one to use based on the &quot;fade step&quot;.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Here's the NES palette with numbers scribbled all over it:<br /><img src="https://i.imgur.com/nLPvnNc.png" alt="Image" /><br />The $3X row is lightest, $2X is a little darker, $1X is darker still, $0X is darkest. If you need to go darker than $0X, you can only go to black.<br /><br />So to make the palette darker in a simple way, all you need to do is subtract $10 from every color each frame. If a color is already in the $0X row, subtracting $10 will clear the carry. And then you store black instead.<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">ldx #15;Last color in the palette.<br />palettefadeloop:<br />lda palette,x;Load<br />sec<br />sbc #$10<br />bcs storedarker;It the subtract didn't cross zero, store the result<br />lda #$0F;Else load black<br />storedarker:<br />sta palette,x<br />dex<br />bpl palettefadeloop<br /></div><br />One Caveat! $0D is a color to avoid using, since some TVs don't like it. So you want a special case to avoid it appearing. The column is affects is $XD. You still want $3D to go to $2D, but you want $2D to go straight to black.<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">ldx #15;Last color in the palette.<br />palettefadeloop:<br />lda palette,x;Load<br />cmp #$2D<br />beq fadetoblack<br />sec<br />sbc #$10<br />bcs storedarker;It the subtract didn't cross zero, store the result<br />fadetoblack:<br />lda #$0F;Else load black<br />storedarker:<br />sta palette,x<br />dex<br />bpl palettefadeloop<br /></div><br />Fade ins are a touch more complicated because every index has a different end point, but give it a shot based on this.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />You were pretty fast with replying. I was in the middle of editing my post when you posted :p<br /><br />Fading in might work if you either store the target palette to RAM or use indices based on where the target palette is located.<br /><br />One method of implementing the fader could be by having it as a part of the palette buffer subroutine. If a flag for it is set, a counter will count every frame from set value (fade speed) to zero. Then a palette update would be requested and the fade step counter would be incremented or decremented based on fade direction. The fade step variable is used to calculate how much to subtract from the original color and then push it to the stack.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />The palette fading itself seems to work perfectly, although for some reason during this process the screen is shaking. It might be some weird thing with the PPU that I'm not aware of since the variables I'm loading to the <tt style="margin-left: 2px; margin-right: 2px; padding:3px; background-color: #3355aa; color: white;">$2005</tt> register stay at <tt style="margin-left: 2px; margin-right: 2px; padding:3px; background-color: #3355aa; color: white;">#$00</tt> the entire time. I'm once again including both source code and compiled ROM.<br /><br />EDIT: The nametable viewer does show the scroll position jumping around, but I'm still not sure what could cause this

I guess I forgot it during the <tt style="margin-left: 2px; margin-right: 2px; padding:3px; background-color: #3355aa; color: white;">BRK</tt> I had from asm.<br /><br />Next up would be background update. I want to try to make the actual code on my own at first, but I need a &quot;hint&quot; to help a bit. So my question is:<br />What lookup tables do I need (aside the compressed level data)? Scrolling is vertical (I'm making a shoot em up).<br />I was planning on compressing the levels into 16x16 metatiles, then to rows on metatiles, and then to screens. Would the compressing to rows be useful if you keep decoding time and the additional compression rate in mind?
