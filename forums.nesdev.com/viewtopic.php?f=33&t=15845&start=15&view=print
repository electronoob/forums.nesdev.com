		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I had plans for a 4 player party style game for last year's compo. Unfortunately I never put in enough time to actually get it done, even though I'd really like to for this years compo. (One compo rule I had some trouble working around was the no prg-ram one. I needed some extra ram on the cart to get things working)<br /><br />The chances of me actually making it for this year would probably increase a little if it was a dedicated party cart with neat features like shared scores between games and such, but I think such a requirement would dillute the already very thin nes homebrew scene a little too much.<br /><br />Such a cart could be made anyways once there are enough authors of party games interested in adjusting them for it. I'm sure people wouldn't mind if some (or all) of the games were already released on the compo carts.

Ranking the lowest-scoring games may be discouraging to creators, especially newcomers.

It allows to compare to others watching objective numbers and (since details were released) it allows to analyze what's going wrong or not-so-wrong category by category. That's actually a very good thing and my favourite part of participating to compo/jams: never hopping to finish first, but see what to improve.<br /><br />In the cart itself, the &quot;runner-up&quot; titles are sorted alphabetically so players do not start with a bias. It would not be useful to them to have the score and may be perceived as &quot;This game is bad, you will not like it. Play it.&quot;

I think those who have entered in previous compos know what is or isn't acceptable, but, to avoid future problems with newcomers, I'd link to an official set of rules of what's considered &quot;all audiences&quot; in your country, which I think is what you are aiming for when you ask for no &quot;explicit content&quot; to be added if the entrant want his or her work eligible for the multicart <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />

If you live in a particular place, you probably have a reasonably good idea of what is &quot;acceptable&quot; for children within your sphere of culture, but that's about it, and there are no hard rules.<br /><br />There aren't really hard rules for official ratings systems either, there are a lot of subjective decisions made by the various review board in place. They do generally have public guidelines, but the rating decision is ultimately made arbitrarily by a closed group. Some of the guidelines are stupidly arbitrary at face value (e.g. can you say &quot;fuck&quot; one time, but not two times in a PG-13 movie?).<br /><br />What I think we really need is not so much an attempt to make rules, but a hierarchy of authority so someone can make the subjective call as needed. I think basically infiniteneslives should have the final say here, since he seems to have the most liability and is essentially the role of publisher here. (I can't think of any publisher that does not reserve the right to make arbitrary choices of censorship.)<br /><br />Putting up some guidelines would be helpful though, as to lower the amount of potential surprise when a censorship decision is made.

I think it's also important to realize the difference between the compo and the cartridge.  There are no restrictions on compo entries one can be as artistic/explicit as they would like with their compo entry.  But when it comes to including that work on a completed cartridge that's a community project, some discretion may be to be exercised.
