<br />The manufacture's part number is BA17805T 
<br />
<br />and the supplier's (digikey's) part number is BA17805T-ND
<br />
<br />they are just two different ID numbers for the same item.  Digikey basically slaps a ND on the end of all the part numbers to let you know that's their part number for the item.

That heat sink is still quite hot though, too hot to keep a finger on after just 20mins.  Why didn't Nintendo use a 7V pwr sup? Were 9V supplies cheaper, and more readily available. I might just install a case fan to keep things cool.

Looks like adaptor have transformer for 100V grid, so you have 10V instead of 8V. Best way to sort this problem is... use noname universal adaptor and setup 7.5-8V <strong>before</strong> regulator, when NES is <strong>on</strong>. 10V is too much. Or another way is install bigger heatsink.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Just to be clear, since I haven't seen it mentioned, that with an unregulated linear power supply (like the original Nintendo AC adapter), the voltage will vary by the current used.  <a href="http://www.horrorseek.com/home/halloween/wolfstone/Power/powwal_WallWarts.html" class="postlink">This page</a> has some measurements from various ones.  The voltage/current rating of 9V/500mA means it's supposed to output at least 9V when 500mA are drawn.  If it's unregulated, it may be 13V or something if it's passing less current.
<br />
<br />And also, the front-loading NES connects the unregulated power to it's expansion port, so it made sense for the NES to have some extra power available.  You wouldn't need an extra AC adapter for the Famicom Disk Drive (nor a battery compartment like the FDS had).
<br />
<br />I've been designing a board (haven't worked on it lately) that includes a switching power supply powered by the NES expansion port, and I've expected the input voltage to be in the range of 7V-20V.  When using a 12V power supply I think it may be as high 20V.
