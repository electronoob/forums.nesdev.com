I've not really heard of or seen an example of 3. If you plan for multi-game storage functionality you'll just need a Master Bank Register like the SmartCard.

While it says it is MBC1 it actually contains either additional banking hardware or it is wired in some way that is non standard to achieve multi-cart functionality. You'll just have to use the single game releases.

In other words, can I lump MBC1/2/3 together and treat them identically, so I only have to check &quot;is this MBC5 or is it MBC &lt; 5&quot; (seeing as I have no intention of supporting the MMM01 or HuC_ mappers <img src="./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" />).  I most likely won't bother with multi-game, but that really depends how I feel down the road when I have something actually working.<br /><br />So, just to be sure I'm on the right track, would handling these 3 conditions in the MBC synthesis fix all or nearly all of the games being patched here, or are there other issues going on that you are fixing with these patches?<br /><br />Also, a tangential question:  The MBC5 seems to support 64Mbit ROM and 1Mbit RAM, judging from the address line count on all of the pinouts I've seen floating around the internet.  Are there any games that actually use these sizes, or would it be a waste to go with those sizes if I wasn't planning to add multi-cart support?

As far as larger ROM, the 32Mbit and 64MBit ROMs I'm planning to use share the same footprint (with the high address line of the 64Mbit being NC on the 32), so I suppose no reason not to at least support the possibility, even if I end up mostly using 32.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />That's right, only one game ever used 64mbit, so that 9th bit is usually totally useless. <br /><br />MBC1,2,3 do have differences but I think they are reasonably compatible. Usually the incompatibility is between others and MBC5. You could look at the mapper capability to try to spot any incompatibility issues. I think though that any MBC1, 2, or 3 game would run on a MBC3 with RTC. <br /><br />So you probably just need MBC3 and MBC5 modes. But there could be issues I'm not aware of.

I am from Russia.<br />I and many of my friends are fans gb.<br />First I would like to thank the user-MottZilla and others users who support this device and release patches for games.<br />MottZilla your version of the program with the saved Windows Flasher Program with MottZilla's Menu very necessary. With its help it is possible to play several games simultaneously and have fun  the use of GB. It was necessary. Thank you! <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />I found a few more games with problems.<br />1) Donkey Kong Land 2. The game bug at the first level of the water when trying to use the fish. Most interesting is that when you use the program (Windows Flasher Program with MottZilla's Menu) the game not bug, but lost the ability to save.<br /><br />2) Mole Mania. The game throws out (just as in Battletoads in Ragnarok's World) in the battle with 3 boss levels.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Wow, had no idea this thread was still going on. I just registered to say thank you, MottZilla and crew. This particular cart seems to have fairly low support from its manufacturer, and so it's awesome to see people reverse engineering and patching stuff up to work nicely with it.<br />  I did have a question, though. I tend to use both 32M banks, with bank one dedicated to LSDJ and bank two dedicated to games and my less used audio stuff. It would be awesome to use the firmware patch to have multiple saves. I'm just wondering, in addition to how it works on a basic level, whether or not I would be able to use the patch successfully with a setup like that. I'd also like to know whether or not the firmware can be flashed back to normal, or how that works. My guess is that flashing it at all with the EMS software would set it back to its original state, is this correct at all?<br /> <br />  Thanks again, y'all are doing some *awesome* stuff, here.<br /><br />   -Bornyesterday
