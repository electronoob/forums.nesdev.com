<br />Also, have a question:  
<br />In the Trace box on Nintendulator's Debugger screen... it has <span style="color: violet">LDA $01 = 0F</span>.  I understand that $01 means $0001.  What does the <span style="color: violet">= 0F</span> mean?  I don't understand what that is for.  : (

<br />
<br />ok, so this is what happened... Memblers wrote earlier, in this thread:
<br />
<br /><div class="quotetitle">Memblers wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">Just a minor point, but I would suggest to avoid doing .equ #00000000 and would do .equ 00000000 instead, then put the # in your code.  I know it should work either way, but it's helpful to have your code be as clear as possible that immediate mode is being used (in addition to using all caps for defined constants, like you're doing already).</div><br /><br />and I didn't understand what he ment by ", then put the # in your code."<br /><br />Today, just a little while, ago I read these wise words from Tepples<br /><div class="quotetitle"><span style="color: orange"><a href="http://nesdev.com/bbs/viewtopic.php?p=72005#72005" class="postlink">here,</a></span> tepples wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">load_font:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;lda #font&amp;255<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;sta addy<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;lda #font/256<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;sta addy+1<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;ldx #3<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;ldy #0</div><br />What do the first two lda's do? I don't understand the #font&amp; and #font/ parts. Does a preceding # mean? Can that character be left out?<br /></div><br /># means the following value is a number to put directly into A, not an address from which to load the value into A. Look at the "immediate" addressing mode.<br /></div><br /><br />And so in my head # started to make sense.  I was running and stepping through my "game" with a break everytime there was a write to $0000 through $0002.  That's where i placed the three variables<br />0) currControllerButtons<br />1) lastControllerButtons<br />2) newControllerButtons<br />that I had been watching and thinking about.  For some reason the top line of the Memory box started with 0F 0F 00 and that didn't make sense.  Why would it be thinking someone had pressed every direction all at the same time?  And so I tried the break (same one as i mentioned earlier) to find out.  And finally it all started making sense!  Each line was missing a # and so that ment that it was an address from which to load the value into A!!  So I quickly went to the top of my prg file to this code <div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">BUTTON_RIGHT .equ 00000001b<br />BUTTON_LEFT&nbsp; .equ 00000010b<br />BUTTON_DOWN&nbsp; .equ 00000100b<br />BUTTON_UP&nbsp; &nbsp; .equ 00001000b<br />BUTTON_START .equ 00010000b<br />BUTTON_SELECT equ 00100000b<br />BUTTON_B&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;.equ 01000000b<br />BUTTON_A&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;.equ 10000000b</div> and I started to add a # in front of each binary number... but quit and undid that and quickly went to my vblank file to my code where it says <div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;lda newControllerButtons&nbsp; &nbsp; ; Is the A button down?<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and #BUTTON_A ;10000000b<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;beq @b<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;inc aFrame&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ;run only once per press.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />@b:&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;lda newControllerButtons&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;;Is the B button down?<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; and #BUTTON_B ;01000000b</div>
<br />and as you can see, I added a # right before each use of my constants.  <span style="color: violet">"and Button_A"</span> became <span style="color: violet">"and #Button_A"</span>.  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_eek.gif" alt=":shock:" title="Shocked" />  It works better than it used to!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Memblers, I'm so sorry that I didn't write and ask you what you were trying to say!  The question that remains unasked is dumb.  I agree. : )

<br />
<br />I would check that the song was made with a version that the playback engine is compatible with (there had been a lot of Famitracker updates, so that's always a possible problem).  Next I would check that the RAM locations used by the playback engine aren't being used by your program.  Then last is probably not necessary, but I'd make sure the engine is setting the right bits in $4015, and doesn't depend on the user to set those (I'm pretty sure the engine would handle those, it really should).

<br />Yes, soI get the same problems after I changed it to play your <span style="color: red">danger streets</span>.  The screen shakes up and down... maybe in beat with the music.  Our lady meta-sprite is shoved over to the left of the screen where she stays trapped until I press <span style="color: violet">start</span>.  It sounds weird, the same way my song sounds weird.  I'm going to try to make a mp3 recording of the sound so you can hear and maybe help me some more.  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />
