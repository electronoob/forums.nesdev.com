But I did notice and just checked, the SST39SF series Flash claims "greater than 100 years data retention".  AMD Flashroms claim 20 years at 125 degrees C (that's 250+ Fahrenheit), I'm sure it would last quite a while at room temperature.

<br />EPROM was used when Flash doesn't even existed. That's why

<br />
<br />Flash as far as we know is pretty stable and in theory more stable than EPROMs. MaskROMs are even more stable than both, at least in theory. 
<br />
<br />I too would use Flash over EPROM for something intended to last a long time, but keep in mind tons of Arcade Games stored game data on EPROMs and are very old now and still work fine and have not suffered bit rot. If you properly erase and program EPROMs your data will last for many years, 20 years and maybe more. It's hard to say. Though I guess since more factors are at work compared to Flash you might want to go with that for more consistent results.

<br />I use these on my devcarts. But then I'll have to open a window, and I don't want a reproduction with a big hole on it
<br />
<br />Well, which Flash series should I use?

<br />As for what to use, get whatever your programmer uses. I prefer 5V only flash chips, which seem to be mostly 49F, though its not a rule. Just check datasheets before buying.

<br />
<br />The only way we can investigate is to view the datasheets for any particular chip that's available to you.  SST39SF is available from Digikey, at least.  I have some AM29F040Bs, but I guess the shipping would cost more than the parts.
