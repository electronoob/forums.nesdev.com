		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Hey guys, i'm new to the hardware modding scene and want to try my hand at some repros/translations. I've been making rom hacks for a number of years and even done some graphical overhauls of a few games. Never thought about putting them on hardware but now i'd really like to! I also really want to make an english translation cart of Star Ocean which is one of my favorite SNES/SFC games. I've compiled a lot of things that i need to purchase, but was wondering what i might be missing in case i run into a brick wall.<br />what's i've already picked up/ordered<br /><br />Willem GQ-3X rom programmer<br />TSOP to Willem adapter boards<br />29F032 TSOP chips and adapter boards from buyicnow (AMD AM29F032B-90EC -TSOP Adapter III)<br /><br /><br />I understand this will be usable for some of my translations and maybe others, and it's easier than piggybacking the larger eproms despite not needing an adapter to program them &gt;_&gt;<br /><br />anyhow any other input would be appreciated before i dive in and get stuck which i know will happen haha

SNES Dev suggests you intend to program or create some new software or maybe a hardware device. You're just talking about making repros/bootlegs. <br /><br />Alot of people have issues trying to make reproductions with the surface mount chips and adapters. There is no gain to doing that over using brand new reflashable boards like INL's. It's just alot of work for nothing. Also because of how many people got involved the chip you need is more expensive and harder to obtain than before. Alternatively the flash carts like the PowerPAK, SD2SNES, and EverDrive are very handy for any gamer. <br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.infiniteneslives.com/products.php">http://www.infiniteneslives.com/products.php</a><!-- m -->

I also really want to make an english translation cart of Star Ocean which is one of my favorite SNES/SFC games.</div><br />If all you want to do is play romhacks of games (regardless of what the romhack is, e.g. English translations, Mario replaced with an animated dildo spurting poop, whatever), then making &quot;reproductions&quot; (read: writing games to EEPROM, making carts that use EEPROMs, etc.) is a bit overkill.  You can accomplish the same thing with a lot less effort/pain by simply getting a flash cart.  The post from MottZilla about the INL cart is similar advice; it saves you a lot of pain.<br /><br />TL;DR -- Bregalad is trying to save you lots of pain given what your interests/desires are -- unless your desire really <strong>is</strong> to make reproductions on real carts and sell them (or maybe not even sell them).<br /><br />You have to understand that there's a long-established history of people showing up on this forum (for NES or SNES stuff) who have little-to-no hardware familiarity and who all have ulterior motives (specifically burning romhacks or English translations to EPROM or EEPROMs and then putting them on carts and then selling those carts for jacked up prices (hundreds of USD) on eBay).  People are free to do whatever they want, all here will agree with that sentiment, but you have to understand the years of history folks here have seen when it comes to these type of requests.  Nobody is blaming you or accusing you of anything, trust me -- it's just a very common topic that comes up, and the term &quot;reproduction&quot; is used repeatedly instead of the person actually saying &quot;I just want to make carts and sell them for insane amounts of money and that's my {hilarious} get-rich-quick scheme&quot;.  :-)

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />oh yeah i understand that there's people out making those megaman and bass or fake earthbounds and trying to sell for $70-100, but i'm not interested in making money off it. i want to make the carts as a personal satisfaction, and maybe give a few to my friends, (one friend really wants a terranigma, and owner of a local retro store said he'd give me store credit if i made him a clock tower translation lol)<br /><br />but yeah i'm not looking to monetize this, it's a hobby more than anything and it's cool when the hobby has a functional outcome. I like the idea of the INL board and programmer, but since i already have most of the expensive hardware out of the way(programmer, soldering tools, adapters) then it seems that just programming and chip swapping would be a better way for me to do it. and there's an abundance of usable donors at my discretion.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />INL's carts can run Star Ocean. ROM data must be programmed in the correct memory map for it to function which isn't the same way people's ROM files are organized. There is no need to use an original cartridge. Also I believe it uses surface mount so if you do mess with it you better be good at handling that. <br /><br />What do you mean EPROMs for $2-$3? That's pretty vague so I'm not sure what memories you mean. The 29F032 that is commonly used costs more than that now. The smaller 8-bit 27C801 definitely cost more than that and you'd need up to 4 for some of those games. If you're not using the 27C801 then you need to also factor in the cost of an adapter for each game. You could also factor in your time spent doing the whole process. And ofcourse the donor games you are throwing away the original chip for. <br /><br />I think INL's boards are quite competitive to the method you are interested in. The best part about it too is let's say your friend or yourself gets tired of whatever hack or translated game you put together. If you made it with the method you favor, you're stuck with it unless you want to disassemble the cartridge and desolder the memory for the board to reprogram it. <br /><br />But if you used INL's board you could just pop the cartridge in the programmer and change it to a different game and only need to change the label on the cartridge if you so desired. <br /><br />Oh and believe me, the appeal of the satisfaction of making these things disappears quickly. Yes doing a couple might be satisfying if you've never done anything like it before. But after that it's just work. Just because you have an EPROM programmer is no reason to go that direction. <br /><br />So before you go either direction you might want to seriously consider the costs to doing it. I think you underestimate the cost of using original game cartridges and hacking them up with adapters and flash memory. A big cost is your time.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />the 29F032 chips are 32MBit chips and can be had for $6 each or less. the adapters are 60 cents a piece, so say i'm in $7 per 32mbit. seems a lot cheaper than $20 per flashable board. time isn't an issue as this is more a hobby for myself, and with a $7 investment it's easier to pass one off to a friend to play with rather than a $20 board that he might want reflashed sometime down the road. <br /><br />and with 32mbit chips i'm free to make most of the games i want at the moment(clock tower, terranigma, star ocean, etc) and can still piggyback these chips the same as others. The only glaring issue with these cheaper but larger chips is that they're surface mounts so they're a bit tougher to solder.
