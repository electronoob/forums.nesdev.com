One of the earliest microprocessor-based ones, with clear heritage from the older digital-logic-only boards that preceded it.<br /><br />In the intervening time I've been <em>stupidly</em> obsessed with it, because it's so familiar and yet so alien:<br />* One of the first 6502-based arcade machines (late 1976) <span style="font-size: 67%; line-height: normal">(‚Üêedit)</span><br />* A sprite system similar to the C64's<br />* A dual-ported video memory system similar to the VIC-20 and C64<br />* Predating the VIC-20 by 4 years (and the C64 by 6 years)<br />* The same nominal resolution (and pixel aspect) as the NES<br />* About as much available-for-CPU RAM as the 2600<br /><br />I initially started porting a specific deliberately disowned project by tepples to it, but between deciding that I Was Not Going To Release It (that would be horribly rude), and the UI (and MAME UI) impedance mismatch, I decided it wasn't any fun anymore.<br /><br />So I made a simple sound-effect tool instead.<br /><br />The hardware actually has 1 KiB of RAM, of which 7/8ths is used for the nametable = screen memory. Another 15 bytes are used for the various sprites and other control registers. The remaining 113 bytes are all that's easily used by the CPU for whatever not-directly-visible state exists.<br /><br />MAME's emulation is (of course) kinda lackluster.<br /><br />Attached are:<br />* My (somewhat meandering) notes about the hardware, and MAME's emulation of same<br />* My source code for my sound effect generator (h/t Shirtu for NESst)<br />* A pre-compiled build of the sound effect generator so that you can just run it<br /><br />Sound effect editor UI:<br />Right steering wheel / MAME left/right - move left/right<br />Left steering wheel / MAME d g - move up/down<br />Either gas pedal / MAME lctrl a - play<br />Gearshifts / MAME z x c v q w e r - edit item under cursor<br />Track select / MAME spacebar - clear current item under cursor<br />Either start button / MAME 1 2 - clear current <em>row</em> under cursor

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Cool stuff.  I'll watch the video and read the docs.  I love examining old, old hardware too, and seeing how clever things were implemented.<br /><br />I _suppose_ the advantage of having the BG map in limited RAM is being able to check quickly for collisions... but using 7/8 of the RAM for that seems wasteful.  Then, on the other hand, the BG has to be somewhere on a RAM chip on the board, so I guess it makes sense to consolidate needed RAM into a single chip.  (Sorry, just thinking to myself.)

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I think that had it actually been done entirely in discrete logic, they'd have just played the tracks out of ROM, instead of copying and unpacking the 4 bits-per-tile into the nametable.<br /><br />I think the big reason they switched to (comparatively) lots of RAM for the tile map with a CPU is that it makes the state machine that renders the screen a lot simpler. You don't need to say &quot;oh, it's scanlines 0-7, I should maybe display the message about coins; now it's scanlines 8-23, should I display the score; now it's scanlines 24-63, should I display the message or the track&quot;

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />A lot of early arcade games had really long hblank periods--a 67%/33% active/hblank ratio was absolutely typical. The hardware needed that much time to prepare the sprites.<br /><br />I remember that the operators manual for one of the first arcade games to use a 320 pixel horizontal resolution (I think it might have been Gradius 2?) warned that when you were converting a cabinet from another game, you would most likely have to adjust the monitor to keep the picture from spilling off the edges.
