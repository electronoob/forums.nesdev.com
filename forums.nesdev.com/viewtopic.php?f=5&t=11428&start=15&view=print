Yep legitimate use of <tt style="margin-left: 2px; margin-right: 2px; padding:3px; background-color: #3355aa; color: white;">/V</tt> or the like.<br /><br />I can only think of a few conditions where a drive would return an I/O error on a write -- particularly if the drive has a tremendous amount of reallocated LBAs to the point of exhausting the spare sector table.  I experienced that for the first time on a large disk just a few weeks ago while doing data recovery for someone.<br /><br />If you can get SMART attributes from the destination drive (a utility like HD Tune Pro, specifically the Health tab, might suffice -- but there's a lot of info that utility doesn't provide that smartmontools/smartctl.exe does) I can tell you if anything looks ominous or if it's something related to a USB/SATA bridge or at some other layer (i.e. &quot;drive looks fine, issue is elsewhere&quot;).<br /><br />Those USB/SATA bridges (&quot;drive enclosures&quot;) are such a pain in the butt.  So many of them do things that they shouldn't when it comes to ATA protocol.  Sad koitsu.

That way we could tell people not to buy one on the &quot;sad koitsu&quot; list.

Downloads would &quot;complete&quot;, but re-checking would reveal a handful of blocks wish hash mismatches. From doing research I determined that this paricular bridge was commonly rebadged by a number of companies. Perhaps this is related to your issue?

I need a screenshot of the Health tab, window resized to show all the attributes, with the proper drive selected.<br /><br />If no attributes are shown, then the SATA/USB bridge does not permit SMART ATA CDB passthrough, which means it's one of those chips which makes it impossible to actually get visibility into drive-level issues (you'd instead have to take the drive out of the enclosure and attach it to a SATA port directly).<br /><br />If attributes are shown, then I also need a screenshot of the Info tab, so I know what drive model I'm looking at, in addition to some general drive details.  &quot;Decoding&quot; attributes needs to be left to someone who knows how to decode them (i.e. me).  How to decode them varies per manufacturer, drive model, and sometimes firmware revision.<br /><br />But attribute review isn't 100% indicative of a problem or things working correctly; there are things like SMART self-test logs and SMART error logs which HD Tune Pro does not provide visibility into, but utilities like smartmontools do.  smartmontools is available for Windows as a CLI program <tt style="margin-left: 2px; margin-right: 2px; padding:3px; background-color: #3355aa; color: white;">smartctl.exe</tt> and can work with some USB/SATA bridges but figuring out what value to pass to <tt style="margin-left: 2px; margin-right: 2px; padding:3px; background-color: #3355aa; color: white;">-d</tt> is painful.  Sometimes <tt style="margin-left: 2px; margin-right: 2px; padding:3px; background-color: #3355aa; color: white;">smartctl --scan</tt> can help determine that.  But again, not all USB/SATA bridges support SMART ATA CDB passthrough, while to make matters even more annoying, some support it but only certain sub-CDB fields are passed while others aren't (ex. fetching attributes is allowed but examining logs isn't).  This is one of the many reasons why I hate those bridges -- they act as a middle-man and often filter or rewrite CDBs.
