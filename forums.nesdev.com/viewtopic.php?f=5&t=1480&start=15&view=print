<br />
<br />I would definitely give the PPU one more VRAM register that allows you to access PPU memory during rendering.

<br />Would it be possible to do a CPLD mapper with a feature similar to HDMA ?
<br />Another good trick of a CPLD mapper would be to use a lot of VRAM that is of non-standard use, to have pattern tables rendered in a special way that could take advantage of various CHRAM and CHROM aspect. Since the mapper itself would handle this, it would be possible to outstand normal restriction.
<br />However, BG scaling and rotating, polygon mapping, etc... could only be done in 4 colors more (due to the tile limitation), and that would be pretty bad.
<br />Imagine a NES game with PS2 like graphics, but only in 4 colors and low resoliton ? It wouldn't look much better than normal NES 2D games will full colored stuff I think.
<br />
<br />3 GHz CPU wouldn't be possible for ROM access time, problem due to noise immunity between the console and the cartridge, etc... I think anything above ~20 MHz would be really too much distorted between the cart and the console.

<br />Btw, you're lucky that Bananmos isn't any longer on the forums. It it would randomly come back and read this, I think he would kill you or something. Just telling "I tried to do blah blah....." without mentionning that you put it on a devcad and test it on a real NES just after will already make him mad. Even if I think he sometimes exagerrate, I have to agree that it isn't fair to say such think as the quote above, because it wouldn't make too much sense. 
<br />
<br />You can do SNES developpement if you want to fully benefit on the better hadware the SNES have, or PC developpement if you want a 3GHz CPU, etc, etc... I won't repeat that boring stuff over and over, because it isn't fair. I think want to expand the hardware is a good idea. Want to change the hardware isn't.

<br />Scanline interleaving. Palette 0 is black/red/blue/magenta, and palette 1 is black/dark green/medium green/light green. For areas with little color, it would use palette 2 with black/grays. The mapper's RAMDAC-replacement would dither each frame down to the appropriate frame base, and then draw red/blue on even lines and green on odd lines, forcing the attributes appropriately. Of course the proof of concept for this method would be a TV tuner.

<br />I didn't follow you at all here. You mean some kind of flickering to get proper colors ?

<br />Yes. Flicker each block of 8x1 pixels among several palettes so that the net color over time is correct. Also, so that the player doesn't perceive the flicker as a flicker, don't make too many blocks in one area the same color in any given frame.
