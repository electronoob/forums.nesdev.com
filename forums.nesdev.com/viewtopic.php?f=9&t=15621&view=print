		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I purchased a cartridge of the homebrew game &quot;The Legends of Owlia&quot;, and I really love it. I would like to make a personal backup of it, however, and I can't seem to get any data from it. As far as I know, it should be UNROM-512 or some similar variant, but no matter what I try PRG-ROM simple reads back as all 0's.<br /><br />Does anyone have any experience backing up this particular game?<br /><br />Edit:<br />Solved the issue. InfiniteNESLives suggested preventing the EXP0 pin from grounding, so I covered it with electrical tape and it worked. See page two of this thread for details! Thanks everyone!

Is there any way with Kazzo to write to M2 at a given frequency, I wonder? I could probably try to build a custom breadboard that outputs pulses, but I'd rather not have to go that far <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">rainwarrior wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">I dumped Owlia with my CopyNES.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Ah, I see what you're saying. The problem is that no matter what, all I seem to read back are 0's, not a single byte is anything else. So unfortunately I don't think I can try this since I wouldn't be able to find an actually 0 value byte by polling.<br /><br />What I could do is look at the beginning of the demo ROM and find a 0 value, then try writing the first bank switch (0 at $8000) to that address and hope the data in the actual cart is the same. I'll try that in a little bit. <br /><br />Thanks for the idea!

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I've tried a couple new things, to no avail:<br /><br />1. Writing a bank number to an address that contains that value (at least in the demo ROM). Received all 0's<br />2. Without writing anything at all, reading from 0xC000 to 0xFFFF, which should be a fixed bank. Received all 0's<br /><br />I'm beginning to suspect that it is in fact some sort of anti-copying lockout. Not once in the several hours I've spent trying things have I read any value other than 0 from the cartridge. It's very perplexing. <br />The cartridge works just fine in my NES! I've also made dumps of other cartridges since trying Owlia, just to make sure I didn't manage to smoke my Kazzo somehow, and it seems to be fine.

It needs at least 5 latch bits.<br /><br />There's no CHR-ROM, it's RAM.<br /><br />I don't really know anything about how the Kazzo works, but if you're getting all 0s I highly doubt it's from any kind of copy protection scheme. (I have the same board, but it dumped exactly as expected via CopyNES.) I think the problem is probably to do with the Kazzo somehow but I can't really speculate.
