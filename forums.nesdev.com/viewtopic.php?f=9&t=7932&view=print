<br />Some of you may have seen a Nintoaster before (some videos on youtube as well as the Angry Video Game Nerd having one), it's a front loader NES rebuilt into a toaster. The original creator has an instructional video on how to make one.
<br />I'm fairly experienced in soldering and modding, so I decided to try it. As far as what is modded:
<br /><ul>RF modulator is removed and replaced with a hand-made video amplifier circuit<br />72-pin connector is removed and replaced with a Game Genie connector wired to the board<br />Expansion port is removed<br />AC Adaptor is built in, wired to the 7805 on the DC side, and wired to the toasters power cord on the AC side<br />Lockout chip is disabled</ul>
<br />Now, I recently finished all of the wiring, I plugged it in and it worked! Except there was a slight humming/buzzing noise. The closest explanation to this I could find, would be that there was a gounding problem, specifically with the 13v DC from the AC adaptor and 5v DC from the 7805 being grounded to the same spot (the NES board). So, first I moved all of the ground wires closer to each other, as well as tried to seperate the gound from the AC adaptor, but in the process I broke one of the wires connecting the Game Genie connector to the board. I re-soldered it on, and tried again, but it didn't work. I realized that I had a short (solder was touching on the Game Genie connections), so I fixed that, and made sure that everything was wired properly and connected. But I can't get it to work at all anymore. I reconfigured everything back to where it was when I had it working with the buzzing noise, but it only gives a blank screen now. I honestly can not figure out what is wrong. Could the short in the connections have fried the board and/or the Game Genie connector?  And is there any way to test or see if any component is broken?

<br />
<br />Did you power it up, while the ground to the 7805 was lifted?  If so, unregulated 13V probably went into the board and popped some chips.  Without a ground, the 7805 will not regulate, and acts as a fancy wire, basically.  
<br />
<br />Shorting stuff on the 72 pin connector probably isn't going to hurt anything- sure it won't work but if you break the short it's going to work again.  
<br />
<br />One time I blew up an NES because I had unscrewed that little PCB with the power/reset switches on it, and it was flopping around and happened to hit one of the data lines on the main PCB.  Since the power switch is controlling the rectified DC (around 12-13 volts) this blew up every chip connected to the data bus.  I did manage to fix it, but it required replacing the EPROM, CPU, and 6522 on the copyNES board,  the PPU, the two 74HC368 chips (Controller inputs), and the RAM chip on the main board... basically most of the chips.
<br />
<br />You might be luckier than I was though;  it could still just be a short or open somewhere.
<br />
<br />Next time, you can eliminate the hum by careful grounding:
<br />
<br />Connect the ground from the power adapter, audio/video jacks, and 7805 and video amplifier to the ground on the NES board right where the modulator was.  Connect them all to the SAME point.  Also, how are you providing the power to run the NES?  Are you using a full wave rectifier?  If it's half-wave (i.e. a single diode) then that could cause some hum in an otherwise hum-free circuit.

<br />
<br />And thanks for the advice on the hum.  I'm just using a newer AC adapter to power the NES, so I'm not sure if it's full wave or half wave.  But I also think a problem with the buzzing was because I hadn't put the metal casing over everything yet, so everything was open.
<br />
<br />But I'm happy that you're saying I still have hope <img src="./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" />
<br />
<br />Edit:
<br />Ok, so today I desoldered the Game Genie off of there and cleaned off as much solder as I could left over on the 72 board connections and stuck the original 72-pin connector back on.  With this, I managed to get a glitchy mess of graphics instead of a blank screen every once in while (while positioning the cartridge in different spots).  Does this mean it's not completely busted?  Some of the connections may not be connecting fully because of the left over solder on the board.

<br />
<br />If you're getting something vice the previous nothing it sounds like you're on the right track.  I guess you could say it's not "completely" bused but it depends how you define that...
<br />
<br />Your connections are vital obviously.  Sounds like you've got a mess of connections that needs to be cleaned up.  Just keep checking them and make sure you use a multimeter.  Don't be afraid to pull on connections to ensure they aren't weak.  If their weak enough to pull off or wiggle with a small amount of effort you connection was junk anyways, so don't be afraid to tug to ensure you've got a good connection. 
<br />
<br /> One tip, I highly recommend using solder flux in ADDITION to what's already most likely in your solder.  I use a pen type applicator that I really like.  This is something that is commonly neglected and people (including myself at one point) don't understand why it's so hard to make a good solder joint, cleanliness is next to godliness, and flux is one of the best cleaners available to you. 
<br />
<br />Now have fun with those 72 pins...

<br />
<br />Yeah the flux in the solder is better than nothing but it will help tremendously to apply flux to the contacts before you solder anything.
<br />
<br />I use IDE style cables for nearly all my projects.  It's great stuff.  If things are falling off I highly doubt it's because it's too thin.  If your connections are weak it's because your solder joints are weak.  And if your solder joints are weak you've most likely got a dirty solder joint.  You'll know because you'll have a hard time getting the solder to stick to anything.  A clean joint will cause the solder to flow wherever the heat is and you'll have no problem making connecitons.  I think they sell flux pens at radio shack.
<br />
<br />You should be able to "tin" the board contact and wire easily if they're clean and fluxed up.  Tinning means just to coat them with solder.  Then it's cake to make the connection, just place the wire where you want it and heat it up.  You won't have to hold the solder with your third hand because the wire and connection already have ample solder.
<br />
<br />Just to give you an idea whats possible with this method here's a picture of a related project of mine: <img src="http://www.infiniteneslives.com/img/images/60to72pin.jpg" alt="Image" />

<br />
<br />Are you able to post pics of your project? Is there anything that looks burnt at all? Maybe take it out of the toaster and see if it works without any casing or put it back in it's original case?
<br />
<br />You could always buy a new 72pin connector for testing?

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />The Buzzing you heard the initial time you turned it on may have been noise from the AC-adapter. If it sounded something inbetween a low B and B-flat (America; 60Hz), or like a low G (Europe; 50Hz), then this certainly is the case. I don't think you have any ground-faults, as the problems would be much worse then; you described is as a "Slight humming noise".
<br />
<br />From previous experimentation, I have gotten similar noises (in addition to lines on the TV) in the case the AC adapter has been unable to provide enough current. It should at least be able to provide up to 1A, as the original adapter from Nintendo does 1.3A. However, this is not the only case where this phenomenon occurs.
<br />
<br />From my point of view, it may just be a case of bad shielding. An AC mains line will create a quite noticable oscillating magnetic field, which will induce current in surrounding elements. In the original NES, the AC line was reduced to "unregulated 9V AC" (Read: "13V AC"), which cause less induction, in addition to the fact that the NES has been properly shielded. Even the RC modulator (where the recifier is), is being shielded separately.
<br />
<br />So, what kind of toaster do you use? How much of the cover is made of metal? And; Do you use a grounded AC outlet/cable?
<br />
<br />---
<br />
<br />I am also working on making a Nintoaster at the moment, and I have decided to use an external DC supply, in addition to the original RF modulator (slightly modified due to faulty recifier). What I use for wiering is old steel solid-core blasting-cap wire (about wire-gauge 20).

<br />I also have a loud buzzing sound coming from the TV with my nintoaster mod.  I have narrowed it down to the VIDEO AMPLIFIER CIRCUIT, or at least I can stop the buzzing by touching two leads of the TRANSISTOR with my bare finger, or by clipping an alligator clip on one of the legs.
<br />
<br />This is rather wierd to me and I can't figure it out.

If so, and if I happen right, it's possible that you could fix the issue by rerunning those modified/extended lines with some small coax instead.
