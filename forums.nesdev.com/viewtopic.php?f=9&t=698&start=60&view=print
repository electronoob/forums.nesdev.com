		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Perfect time for shameless plug, my company ( <!-- w --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.retrousb.com">www.retrousb.com</a><!-- w --> ) makes USB NES controllers.  They work just like standard gamepads so you can use them on emulators and other games.  I have regular controllers, advantage, max, dogbone, powerglove, powerpad, and many other system like SNES, Atari, Genesis, 3DO, etc etc etc
<br />
<br />To make a generic adapter, the data lines would be converted to something like buttons then the software would have to decode the buttons.  I don't know how quickly the games control the timing so the adapter might have to buffer many reads from the controller.  That would break the PowerGlove because it needs very precise timing.
<br />
<br />For the Zapper, USB 1 polls at 125KHz (8mS) so getting a response in 60uS would be very easy for the hardware part.  Dont know about the host side but that is a long time.  The biggest problems are with the Zapper light detector.  It is set for the refresh rate of a TV so it will not work on CRTs.  The frequency can be changed for CRTs but it will never work on LCDs or plasma tvs.  Major surgery would be needed to get those to work.  I think Rob also uses the corner frequency so it would need the same changes.
<br />
<br />Except for something like USB flash drives I don't like the idea of USB for peripherals on a real NES.  The USB host is pretty messy and should save lots of space/money if taken out.  However being able to transfer games on a flash drive would be very nice for those with roms or development games.

<br />
<br />As for the Zapper, I wanted to say that I doubt they would work on non-CRTs or CRTs that are above TV refresh rates.  This includes VGA monitors, LCD or CRT but not RGB monitors below 30kHz.

<br />
<br />Using a USB keyboard is OK so long as you have a good map of the Family Basic Keyboard, but using a mouse as a substitute for a potentiometer-type paddle isn't a great solution.  The USB Stelladaptor supports using Atari paddles, so perhaps you could use one of those.  Not the best solution in all likelihood, but better than anything else.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I believe in the KISS philosophy. In order for Kevtris's project to ever have some possibility of coming into light in an affordable fashion others can take advantage of it's got to be simple. And given the attention to software compatibility, hardware compatibility is also very important. I would say forward-looking technologies should be the first items sacrificed instead of retro compatibility technologies. I mean, isn't that entirely the point?
<br />
<br />Besides, we have to look at even the possibility of this device as an item more for collectors and geeks than for any kind of mainstream. Just having a flash memory port in the early design stage hints at an ulterior motive that will keep the device largely limited to the devoted.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Hi. just getting into software hardware development (slowly realizing i graduated from the wrong dept)
<br />
<br />back to the NEX innards...
<br />
<br />question: since you guys seem to be able to trace the pins that are being grounded rather than being connected to the cart connector, is there an easy fix for this, or is it potentially dangerous.
<br />
<br />IMO a grounded +5V is more dangerous (to the software/hardware) than attemting to connect the ic correctly
<br />
<br />is there any logical reason they did this? could these connections serve another purpose? (obviously not if they are bieng grounded)
<br />
<br />people at dp are worried about getting shocked/fires which I find funny, but I am curious if I took my NEX (my first clone) and correctly wired these pins, would it fix some compatibility problems? what problems would it fix?
<br />
<br />my guess (from reading up on some of your dev forums) that it would only fix some sound issues of "listed compatible" games and make other "listed incompatible" games work correctly. I don't imagine it would allow MMC5 compatibility, video shift correction, or color palatte correction
<br />
<br />are these correct assumtions?
<br />
<br />Kevin, I would love to lend some (very minor) financial support your FPGA NES development project. and someday, when I can afford it, I will. I would also love to see an actual 60/72 pin cart connector on it, but I understand, although easy, it would be time consuming to do, and add even more to the cost.
<br />
<br />thanks to you all for providing all of your knowledge on this site. hopefully, I will someday have the basic knowledge to understand it!

<br />
<br />I know this sounds weird but a similar device had been sold/made for a MSX software emulator/USB cart reader thingy. 
<br /><a href="http://www.msx.org/MSX-Game-Reader.articlepage46.html" class="postlink">http://www.msx.org/MSX-Game-Reader.articlepage46.html</a>
<br />
<br />Would also make the Kevtendo (B) look more 'legitimate'.
<br />
<br />Also thought about using it as a Video system, like a stand alone MPEG4 player type device. Which would give it an alternate market.
<br />
<br />Buy it for its NES playing ability, keep it for the MPEG playback!
<br />
<br />Cutting out all the 5V stuff (irony USB is supposed to be 5V compliant...)
<br />would that really be enough to reduce its cost? from the $300+ to around $250? or lower?
<br />
<br />Also what about instead of having a VGA connector and a discreet S-video/audioL+R connector some kind of multi-connector (Playstation/SNES style?)

The 72 pin edge connector you used is the wrong pitch (0.1" instead of 0.098"). The extra width adds up as you go down the connector. I purchased a 0.1" pitch adapter and did some experimenting with it. After 11 pins the total accumulated "extra" has added up to more than the gap between pads. This shorts out pins 11 and 12. It actually is much worse than that, as I documented in this thread:http://nesdev.com/bbs/viewtopic.php?t=619</div>
<br />
<br />It has never been a problem for me at all.  Maybe this is because I used a third party 72 pin connector?  Not sure, but it has been 100% faithful.

<br />
<br />I suppose it is, but it is an opinion that most people on these forums share.  Some people, on DP's forums for example, have a different view and different priorities.  
<br />
<br />If the Generation NEX didn't have a Famicom slot, it wouldn't have been as big a deal because the universe of NES cartridges is limited and well-known.  Famicom cartridges are less-well known and therefore more incompatibilities are likely, especially as Famicoms use a more diverse collection of cartridge hardware.

<br />The thing could extend out the front, you could use an FDS RAM adapter or any other oddly shaped carts.
<br />
<br />Add a connector on the front for a real NES cart to defeat the lockout chip.
<br />
<br />What if you are using a Famicom cart with audio? No problem, have a cable that comes out of NES audio output, goes into the adapter and back out to your stereo/TV.
