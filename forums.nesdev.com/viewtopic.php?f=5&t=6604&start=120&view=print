<br />Other than that, this isn't some kind of global internet-scope compo or anything, this is just simply something that was put together on this website, pretty much for the users of this message board. Just because this isn't the next biggest/greatest PDRoms compo doesn't mean that we're not allowed to take it seriously. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" />

<br />
<br />I've been talking with jero for a while, I don't think he's wanting to be the main official organizer of everything for the compo, so what I've figured is this thread is mostly to finalize the rules and give notice.
<br />
<br />So I guess what really need to be done is a simple announcement thread with the agreed rules.  I've also estimated that the deadline will be pushed back, because of the slowness in getting this started/promoted.  I've been pretty busy myself lately.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I don't know. It doesn't have to be an official compo with a strict deadline. How many people will participate? I don't think they will be hundreds of them. How many active members these days here? You can almost count them.
<br />
<br />Instead what could be done is people decide to participate and give a flexible dead-line for people that have less time than others to work on their hobby. That way it's more of a "make a game for fun" than "damn, I have to hurry up for that dead-line if not I won't make it". I would hate to commit time and see that in the middle of it, some life event prevent to achieve that goal.
<br />
<br />But some people may not agree with that approach because no strict deadline means no pressure or commitment. Me I don't mind to be more lax since I cannot commit time that much anyway <img src="./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" /> 
<br />
<br />And how much strict do we have to be on the format?  With the "1 man army" approach, even if you use an mmc5, I don't think you can make something better than someone that will use just an unrom. It all depends of the talent of the person and not the hardware in the end. So I guess hardware limitation means squat to me.  In some case, it can help simplify some of the task for the programming side (scanline counter anyone?) when you're limited on time, experience and resource. We should more focus on the end result than small details. Even with all the hardware that exist today, how many great, exciting homebrew came out with some complicated mapper? The answer is none.  So , like I say before, hardware limitation doesn't bring much. The more complicated mappers will just give more data or extra sound. More data doesn't mean a better game. Extra sound channel if you're a terrible artist doesn't make a better game. And even with more place for data it doesn't mean that in a short time that you can make a lot anyway.
<br />
<br />Maybe my ideas are too different. People don't have to agree with them.

<br />
<br />It's not like Usain Bolt can ask the olympic committee if he can run the 100m final two weeks after all the other guys because he's been stressed out and doesn't feel like he's had time to train enough <img src="./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" />  Ok the analogy isn't perfect because I doubt that anyone here has NES game development as their full-time job, but you get the idea (I hope).
<br />
<br />So I'd say set a hard deadline, maybe sometime early 2011. And perhaps add a clause to the rules saying that the compo is cancelled if there are less than X entries.

<br />
<br />I won't have a lot of time to spend either, so I'll be going for a very small project for the minigame category.
<br />Sure, people that have lots of time on their hands will have better results, but I'd really love to see a bunch of original NES games get released, no matter if some entries are much more elaborate than others.
<br />
<br />If this will be a success one could even consider holding such compos on a regular basis, so if you absolutely can't manage to submit in time you could still save your project for the next compo.
<br />
<br />Yep, these are my ideas. People don't have to agree with them either.

<br />
<br />I am and I noticed that Dwedit is too.
<br />
<br />I doubt that I'll have stellar sound effects, but the rest of my game is coming along nicely.  My game isn't very original, but it should be a really nice reimplementation of a classic.  I'm a bit worried about the copyright / trademark police and losing competition points for lack of originality.  However, I am adding some nice polish to the game that did not exist in the original, and doing some NES specific things that the original system can't do.  I can prove that I wrote all of the code myself though.
<br />
<br />Right now my entry will fit into 16kB prog-rom, 8kB char-rom, NROM / no mapper / no WRAM.  From what I can tell, this is qualifies it for the second of the two contests.
<br />
<br />
<br />I've read this thread twice (once when originally posted and once again right now).  I want to know precisely what the rules are.
<br />
<br />How do we submit our entries?
<br />
<br />Do we provide source too, or just a .nes file?
<br />
<br />Is the deadline still 2010-12-31 23:59:59?  Which time zone?
<br />
<br />Are we allowed to copy any music engine code?  If not, may we seek help from others?
<br />
<br />Is someone going to merge all of the category #2 entries into a multi-cart and create physical entities for sale out of them?  That would be awesome, but makes me nervous about the legality of my entry.
<br />
<br />What criteria will the games be judged by?
<br />
<br />Am I allowed to share my development ROM image with anyone to get feedback, or am I supposed to develop this in the dark?

I have a half-done entry called Thwaite, which is my first use of trig in 6502 assembly, and I'll probably start working on it again as soon as he does so.
<br />
<br />To answer another: The rules state "Feel free to use other people's code with permission."
<br />
<br />And as a reminder, the remaining questions are as follows:
<br /><ul><li>To whom can the demo be shown? </li><li>What is the rationale behind the rule against CHR ROM readback? Is it really necessary? </li></ul>
