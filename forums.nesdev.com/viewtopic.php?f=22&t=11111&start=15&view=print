Good NES artists have to figure out how to connect areas with different attributes and how to make partial use of the individual palettes in different areas to make it less obvious that there are only 4 sets of colors making up the image.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />@tokumaru:  Or your game would look like Kirby's Adventure, a surprisingly monochromatic game that came out towards the end of the NES' life.<br /><br />The irony is that there are artists out there who try to emulate NES graphics and have no problem, but to make the exact same graphics for the NES will twist their minds around like a pretzel.  Of all faux-retro games, I think Retro City Rampage comes the closest to matching the NES' graphical abilities, aside from being an MMC5 with 4 way scrolling (they do not get along at all, or so I heard).

I've been meaning to ask, isn't there a Chinese bootleg that not only resembles a computer, it also has a mouse?  I think the NES version of Microsoft 98 or whatever is one of those mouse compatible NES programs.  Any documentation exists for the Chinese NES mouses?

But perhaps a better long-term solution as the supply of authentic Super NES Mouse controllers dwindles would be a microcontroller that acts as a PS/2 host and NES device, translating between PS/2 and Super NES mouse protocols.
