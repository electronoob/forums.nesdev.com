But I doubt that's the issue.<br /><br />Since you are attaching the wires on the back side of the cart, are you sure they are going to the proper pins?  It would be easy to get it upside down bringing wire from the back side and rom top side...

Tried to use a 12v 3amp dc power supply to program the willem, didn't make a difference. I even soldered shorter wires directly to the tsop adapter instead of using the ide socket, same thing. The only time I saw something besides a black screen was with a final fantasy 3 burn. It would turn the screen to some red garbled graphics when the black and white logo screen should come on.

I don't own a Willem so I can't offer much insight.<br />What's throwing me is the verification after programming.<br />Can you look at the hex data?  Is there a bunch of zeros or FF's?

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />It's interesting you say that because my chips erase routine times out normally for me. I have to drag the program window around a bunch causing the countdown timer to freeze and then it will erase properly. I'll go compare the original hex with a chip read hex.<br /><br />Edit: Well the original 4mb Killer Instinct rom is identical to the dump that was saved from the chip. Has anyone here had success using these m29f032d chips on the tsop adapters? Maybe these chips need the 10 ohm resistors?

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I think you might be well served if you tie a wire from the Willem /WE to the adapters /WE pad (opposite of the 5v line to where the resistor would be - or is).  That might cure your erase issue.<br /><br />I don't know if Ki has protection or not, but you might want to try a rom file that matches your host cart with no protection schemes.  <br /><br />It sounds like your chip is programming correctly.  So the only issue I can see is hardware.  Either the adapter isn't making good connection somewhere or maybe you have a solder pad that has broken loose from its trace.<br /><br />Can you do a continuity test from the adapter solder legs to the carts edge connector?  That'll tell you if you have any trace-pad issues.  Remember that OE goes through the MAD1 chip first.  Not sure if CE goes through mad1 first.... But all the address lines and data lines should go directly to the cart edge.<br /><br />Regarding the m29f032d.   They made that flash rom in a reverse pinout.  You might want to verify that your chip ISN'T  the reverse pinout version.    Your flash rom shouldn't need any resistors except the pull up resistor on the WE line.  But since there is no connection from the programmer to the WE line, putting a pull up resistor there will keep the chip from going into programming mode.  Make sense?

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Continuity test checks out. Wonder how I would test if it's a reverse package. Should an ohm test with an unmounted tsop on the two VSS pins show continuity?<br /><br />Edit: Regarding the WE line, yes that makes sense, though pausing the erase window timer seems easier than tying a wire from the willem to the adapter. Forgot to say this was on a KI donor board I didn't want to mess with, but was too anxious not to. Just tried to test the two VSS pins on the right side of the tsop and they have continuity, so presumably this is not a reverse package.
