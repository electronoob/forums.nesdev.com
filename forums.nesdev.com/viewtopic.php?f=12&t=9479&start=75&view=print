Would be great if you could do the two extra tests!<br />Vbat=3.3v - VCC=5v would be closest to real-life operation (which, I hope it works same as VCC=5 Vbat=0, otherwise the current rev-engineered logic tables would be all wrong).<br />Vbat=5v - VCC=3.3v would be interesting as it is resembling power down (when VCC drops below Vbat), some of the MADs force /SRAM.CS high at VCC&lt;=Vbat, other MADs don't do so at VCC=Vbat, but maybe they are at least doing it at VCC&lt;Vbat.<br /><br />Byuu, didn't you have a DSP1B cartridge for decapping purposes? If you still have the leftovers, then you might find a MAD-2 on it (as far as I know DSP1B and MAD-2 are always bundled together).

Chronologically that game (Ballz3D from 1994) might have had a MAD2, but it doesn't have a battery, and probably for that reason no MAD chip. Super Bases Loaded 2 is from 1994 too (and it does have a battery). Do you have that game in your collection, too?<br />If it's MAD2-less, too, then the MAD2 might be found only in later japanese titles, and in later versions of games with long lifetime (namely Mario Kart).

Ie. the chips that don't force SRAM./CS=high on VCC=Vbat don't do it on VCC&lt;Vbat either.<br /><br /><strong>Many many thanks for doing all the tests!</strong><br /><br />Now the only missing thing is the MAD-2. Does somebody have some hints on where to find it? Was it used only in Mario Kart or also in other games? What is the oldest MAD-2 cartridge? The photo at snescentral was dated 1997 (according to the datecodes on the other chios). There might be also a copyright date on the sticker (on the rear side of the cartridge).<br /><br />MAD-2 pinouts/schematic would be also interesting. On the PCB photo it looks as if some pins are used as clock amplifier (replacing the HCU04 chip that is found on other DSP boards), maybe it's also including a Reset inverter (similar as in MAD-R), though with that special features... there's wouldn't be too many pins left for the &quot;normal&quot; functions.

It'd be a little more challenging than droping it in a breadboard or parallel device.  But a female cart connector for inputs and some mini aligator clips for outputs should allow for the connections needed to get the truth table.  And you can use a multimeter to get/verify the schematic without much trouble.
