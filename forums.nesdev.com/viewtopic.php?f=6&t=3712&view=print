<br />Yeah, I didn't expect it to be smaller than DPCM. Hum... I can't think of anything very amusing with that little speech, but maybe we should look into speech synthesizing... I've seen programs reproducing speech from just a few different audio clips (I really don't know how that works, but that's why I said "look into it"). Maybe it would be possible to have a bunch of small clips that when correctly combined would produce intelligible sentences. Sure, it'd sound a bit robotic, but it would be your NES talking with a robotic voice, which fits! Maybe some sort of artificial intelligence program? Sure sounds like novelty to me.
<br />
<br />EDIT: Seems like we could make the NES speak spanish: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diphone" class="postlink">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diphone</a>

<br />
<br />I made a speech synth that works like that, I don't think I'd released it but you can hear it on the last track of my Chipography NSF.  Using DPCM (and not at the highest sample rate, I think it was $C, IIRC), the samples barely fit in 16kB and I had to trim a little bit off of them.
<br />
<br />So the quality would benefit quite a bit with ADPCM, but it could be a bit more cumbersome.  My speech synth is entirely IRQ-driven, so you can do anything you want while it's talking.

<br />
<br />Would you say an NES speech synth could be produced w/ a more analogue approach to it w/ a square or triangle, like Berzerk?  Maybe when I get around w/ messing w/ the sound registers I'll try that...

<br />You could maybe even skip the "y" sound, and just use "i", because "ya" sounds pretty much the same as "ia".

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Haha, yeah it would. But the animalese is just really fast. Maybe .06 seconds is too fast, but I've worked with a cartoon where every frame is shown for .07 seconds at minimum. The mouth movements were really hard to get right because that just was too slow in some places. However, these sounds are .06 seconds, and two of them make a syllable. So most syllables are .12 seconds long at minimum. This may be a moderate speed for japanese, but it might be too slow. I'm sure it would be hard to make it sound natural. Every sample would have to be pretty monotonous to make it not sound like animalese.
