		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />About the menu graphics, I've got some fair recommendations to you.
<br />You want to do magic materia (geen, $29), invocation materia (red, $05), talent materia (yellow $28), support materia (pink $03) and associative matteria (blue $22). But basically a materia is a colorfull sphere and reflects light. So, to have better graphics use some dots of different luminosity to have it looking spheric, not flat and make such palettes :
<br />$29, $22, $30 &lt;- green materias uses color 1 and 3, blue ones uses 2 and 3
<br />$05, $28, $34 &lt;- use this for red and yellow materias
<br />$03, $xx, $30 &lt;- uses this for pink matteria and possibly something else
<br />$00, $10, $20 &lt;- use this for you cursor
<br />
<br />But, you can use theese palettes as well to draw cloud's face, for example the palette used for yellow materias could be used to draw his hair, and the palette for blue materias could draw his eyes, or his clothes.
<br />Now, if you want more customness, you can make the cursor be another color than gray and use the palette of a materia or be drawn in BG. That wouldn't really change the game, and you can use a custom palette that would be different in function of the selected character.
<br />Also, in the main menu, there would be room for three custom sprite palette, and the cursor could use the fourth one. If you prefer do fixed palettes (this is simpler to code), you can use the exact same palettes as on the materia screen to draw your faces.
<br />If you also want a part of them to be drawn in BG, you can still also use either the custom mode (3 free BG palettes in main screen), and do the portraits in graysale mode, or do a fixed BG palette for all portrait, that would reduce the amount of possible color, but that won't forcely affect the quality of the faces, and that enables you to draw all portraits with their color in PHS screen. Else, you can just show the characters, not the faces, like in FF6.
<br />Finally you can have 4 palette techniques : fixed BG and fixed sprites, fixed BG and custom sprites, custom BG and fixed sprites, or custom BG and custom sprites. The only restriction is that you cannot use the gray color as you like for the cusor on materia screen if you use custom sprite palette.
<br />
<br />About the IDE, I don't exacly see any advante on generating a binary file to be .incbin'ed. I think that you had problems earlier while inbin'ing a binary file, but that doesn't meak that this method sucks, scicne it's the EXACT equivalent of using .db
<br />I think that if you use correctly .incbin, there should be no problem. But delete NESASM and pick up a better assembler, you'll have more features and less troubles (even if you need to learn how its directives works).

I'm going to make my IDE so I can edit the map and stuff, but it will do the asm code for me, so I don't have to really do asm too much. And sorry to do this on such short notice, but I think we should use NESHLA. I'm sorry, if you wrote the sound engine in WLADX, it won't be too hard to convert to NESHLA, will it? Sorry about that, I can't really use WlaDx. I like NESHLA, because it's C freindly, and it has many features. But I'm going to send you a private message with my email, so we can be in contact, and send eachother code and stuff. I will most likely reply within the day, because I read my email every day, and usually respond immediatly.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Okay, let's go for NES HLA.... I just have to learn how it's works, so you can count arround the end of the week until I understant proprely how it works.
<br />Generating ASM code like HTML is simply not possible. It is a nonsense to me. Genertaing data is possible, yes, so it would do .db $xx, $xx, etc...
<br />In that case it is the <strong>EXACT equivelent</strong> of a single .incbin, and I <em>can't see any adventages </em>on simply .incbin'ing a file. If you had trouble with the .incbin earlier, that doesn't mean that it suck like you said it before, it is because NESASM suck and possibly because your code threating the data itself.
<br />Eventually, modifing your binary file via an hex editor or a cusom home made editor is not harder than modifing .db $xx
<br />I really can't see why you're mad at .incbin

<br />okay, that's what it looks like on top, because it has those tabs. Okay you click on the Asm file tab:

<br />
<br />There'll be nothing where you clicked on in the asm file tab. Go to the map editor. Make a map. Click on save map, or whatever will be there. You'll go back to the Asm file tab, there'll be map data done in asm for you. Do you understand? Is there anything you don't get? It will be the same for pallete editor, text editor, etc. Forget I ever said anything about any binary file.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Thanks, I understand it better now, but this doesn't answer to my exact question, because I can't see why you would mean "generating asm file", you mean generating data, right ? It wouldn't generate code, or would it ?
<br />If so, it would probably insert :
<br />.db $0f, $11, $21, $30 for an example of a palette. This is okay, but let's say you're encoding 256 maps for your games, each one having a hundred of .dbs.... It's pretty crazy to do it like this, scince doing it via an .incbin and pass trogh an external .dat file would be more clear, proper, etc....
<br />Aside of that I think a such thing would be very good for make things more confortable, but wouldn't it be pretty hard to do (I mean make a win32 application run correcly isn't a piece of cake, is it ?)

I spent more than one hour on it and now that all compiling errors are removed, it outputs a file with invalid vectors and gabrage bank organizazion, and all stuff even the unused one are binary present in the file (aka the macro to write to the MMC1 reg 1 and 2 for CHR bankswitching)

Oh, I could probably study the .nam file load, and figure out a good way to load map data, because I also agree that all those dbs would pile up, and there'd be like a million! But I don't know how I could do collision if I do the binary files. Do you know how I could?

<br />If you're going to do scrolling maps, then .nam is usually not the way to do it. Best is to design your own custom format that decompresses into a buffer, and then blast that buffer to VRAM during vblank time. The maps in the original <em>Super Mario Bros.</em> were a marvel of data compression.

Maybe NESHLA has a random() type thing in it. I'm currently writing the engine for our awesome game. It will be great! It's gonna take a long time to write the engine though...

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />The easiest sort of pseudorandom number generator to implement on a 6502 is the linear feedback shift register (LFSR), which basically involves taking a CRC of a seed followed by a whole bunch of zero bits. Every time you cycle the LFSR you get one bit. Cycle it enough times to get a random number whenever you need one. The smallest practical LFSR is an 8-bit one discussed in <a href="http://www.biglist.com/lists/stella/archives/200412/msg00047.html" class="postlink">this post to the Stella (Atari 2600) mailing list</a>.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />To do maps, you'll HAVE to make your own format.
<br />I think that the metatile thing is good (so you have one number, that can access different group of 2x2 tiles, and each one would have it's own color and collision). When decoding a map, put all the metatiles of the current map in RAM (or rather SRAM because it's larger), and decode the one you need, when it's time to write them to the name table, you should have provisions of code to write them column per column and line per line, including attributes. When the player or a NPC is moving, you should get the metatile collision before allow him to move, so it will move only on a walkable field. Doing some more complex collision is probably needed (to make your character able to be hidden behind the background, etc...)
<br />
<br />With this methods, your maps will probalby have an enormus size. So you'll need to compress them with RLE, or by creating larger groups of 2x2 metatiles (so 4x4 tiles), or something. Use your imagination.
