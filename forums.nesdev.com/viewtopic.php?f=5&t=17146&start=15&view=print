There are already 2 RPG games of it for the Famicom, but they're kinda boring and pretty ugly.<br /><br />There are also some interesting fighting games of the series for PS2, PS3, PS4 and PC, but one of the most interesting aspects of the series doesn't play a big part in any of them: the mythological armors worn by the characters.<br /><br />I'd like to create a small fighting game focused on a smaller arc of the story, to keep the number of characters down, and give more importance to the armors.

F-Zero, after all, came right at the beginning of the system's lifetime; it was a 512 kB SlowROM game with no special chips, based on a concept dreamed up more or less from scratch, written in a relatively short period of time by a handful of programmers who were new to the console, using tools that were available in 1989.  With the resources and hindsight available now, and no time limit, it should be possible to create a more impressive game.  (Plus I have issues with the direction the physics went in for X and GX...)<br /><br />But I'd still want a bunch of help, especially with designing the courses and fine-tuning the balance, not to mention composing the music.  I have no confidence that I'd be able to do the series justice all by myself even with an arbitrary amount of time; that &quot;handful of programmers&quot; were EAD core personnel supervised by Miyamoto himself...<br /><br />Very unlikely this would ever happen, and it's a tad off topic (I'm not big on attempting an F-Zero game on the NES), but I find it fun to think about.

Publishing your game necessarily involves deals between license holders that have to be actively maintained, and in general this gives it a shorter lifespan than other games. You can't give it a &quot;remaster&quot; for new systems, or otherwise repackage it without a new deal. Sequels are out of the question. A lot of stuff that you could &quot;own&quot; about a game you made is off the table when it's a licensed property.<br /><br />Example: the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scott_Pilgrim_vs._the_World:_The_Game" class="postlink">Scott Pilgrim game</a> was delisted from all the places it was previously sold, and will probably remain buried forever, or at least a very long time.<br /><br />Similar thoughts about cover songs, though licensing is different for this, but basically you borrow interest from fans of the original, and on the other side you lose a lot of control over various things, like you have to assume some legal risks to put it up publicly, etc.

Pappa finally gets enough, loads up his trusty musket and goes around slaughtering the valley.</div><br /><br />A comedy radio show did something conceptually similar in the 90s where they rode on the nervousness about video violence. The premise was that they reviewed a the newest, hottest game based on <em>That boy Emil</em> by Astrid Lingren where they mixed speech samples from the movie from 1971 with violent samples from.. i think it was Duke Nukem, not sure.<br /><br /><br />The reason i think Moomin might be a good game IP is because the moomin valley is so dynamic and transformative on an all-encompassing scale. The locale is confined and familiar in scope, yet because of cosmic events, it changes drastically all the time. At one point the comet causes the rivers to dry up and sunken caves along the coast are revealed. Strange seeds transform the whole valley into a labyrinthine jungle at another point. Moomin waking from hibernation in the middle of winter means a wildly transformed landscape inhabited by seasonal creatures he's never encountered before in the summer. Then there's the flood when everything turns into a floaty island world. All within the same, recognizable area.

I had a thought that it would be fun to create a new NES Final Fantasy called <em>Final Fantasy π</em>, as a way to escape the numbering system, but also as a way of saying &quot;somewhere between 3 and 4&quot;, at least in terms of quality of graphics/gameplay. I really enjoy coming up with elaborations on existing stories/concepts, almost like writing fan fiction, so I think this would be a lot of fun. The chances of me actually doing this, however, are virtually zero.

But, since there's actually a <em>new</em> Super Bomberman game now, that's no longer an option! <img src="./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" /><br /><br />So, I'll go with dB-Soft's &quot;Layla&quot;, one of my favorite Famicom games.<br />In fact, the Metroid-like platformer I was working on a few years ago, was heavily inspired by Layla!<br /><br />If I had the Layla license, I'd just continue with what I was doing with &quot;Project Eden&quot;. Create a large solar system, with a dynamic level select, with the secondary function of also acting as the game's difficulty select. (Think Starfox)<br /><br />The game would be developed to be almost more Metroid-like, instead of the weird Mario-ness of Layla. (Specifically, one-way scrolling)
