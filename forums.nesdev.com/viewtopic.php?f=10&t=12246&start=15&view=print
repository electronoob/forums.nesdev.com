You can then search for the label in that text file to find its address, or better yet, turn that label file into an FCEUX debug symbols file which will show the labels directly in the debugger. There is a python script that does this in an example I made a while ago: <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/viewtopic.php?f=10&amp;t=11151" class="postlink">minimal ca65 example</a>

Debug &gt; Trace logger.<br /><br />This lets you dump a text file containing every instruction executed and the status of every register/flag at each step.<br /><br />2. Conditional breakpoints.<br /><br />This lets you set a breakpoint that also has a condition.<br />See: <a href="http://www.fceux.com/web/help/fceux.html?Debugger.html" class="postlink">FCEUX debugger guide</a><br /><br /><br />For example, if you know that if something is wrong if A is 5 at line $8075, then what you can do it start a trace log at a time before things go wrong, create an execuition breakpoint on 8075 with the condition A==#5, then run until the breakpoint is hit. Stop the trace at this point, and you will have a log of everything that happened up until that breakpoint. From here you can work backwards from the end of the file until you see exactly what caused the problem.

If you're asking if I was expecting the accum and x reg to still be preserved as they were prior to the jump in THIS case, no.  I understand they have been affected so their values will be different continuing on.  However, if you're saying I can not count on the value of the variables at all if I'm JSR-&gt;RTSing...that I couldn't even count on this subroutine returning '2'...I'm afraid I have a fundamental flaw in my understanding...

It's just still sitting on the stack lingering, and the next time something pulls from the stack, it's pulling that value...something like that?<br /><br />Huh.

Hm...that is definitely news to me...</div><br />To expand on rainwarrior's comment/question: the contents of A, X, and Y <strong>are not</strong> &quot;backed up&quot; and &quot;restored&quot; when doing a JSR/RTS.  Take this code for example:<br /><br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">&nbsp; lda #$01<br />&nbsp; ldx #$aa<br />&nbsp; ldy #$bb<br />;<br />; At this point in the code, A = $01, X = $AA, Y = $BB<br />;<br />&nbsp; jsr someplace<br />;<br />; At this point in the code, A = $00, X = $22, Y = $BB<br />;<br />loop:<br />&nbsp; jmp loop&nbsp; &nbsp;; Just to keep the code below this from being run<br /><br />someplace:<br />&nbsp; ldx #$22<br />&nbsp; lda #0<br />&nbsp; rts<br /></div><br />That code should be clear/concise and easy to understand.<br /><br />If that comes as a surprise to you, i.e. &quot;I thought A/X/Y were backed up when JSR was used, and restored when RTS was used!&quot;, then that would be a bug.  Is it *the* bug?  I don't know, that's for you to figure out.<br /><br />So if you need to back up and restore registers, you need to make sure your subroutines push those values onto the stack when the routine starts, and pull them off right before the end (and remember to pull them off the stack in the opposite order as you pushed them on).  Again the same code, but fixed to back up and restore A/X/Y:<br /><br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">&nbsp; lda #$01<br />&nbsp; ldx #$aa<br />&nbsp; ldy #$bb<br />;<br />; At this point in the code, A = $01, X = $AA, Y = $BB<br />;<br />&nbsp; jsr someplace<br />;<br />; At this point in the code, A = $01, X = $AA, Y = $BB<br />;<br />loop:<br />&nbsp; jmp loop&nbsp; &nbsp;; Just to keep the code below this from being run<br /><br />someplace:<br />&nbsp; phx<br />&nbsp; pha<br />&nbsp; ldx #$22<br />&nbsp; lda #0<br />&nbsp; pla<br />&nbsp; plx<br />&nbsp; rts<br /></div><br />You could also accomplish the same thing by putting the pushes and pulls around (before and after) the JSR, but that's for you to decide.  Usually when making subroutines people do the backup/restore within the routine itself (at the start of the routine, and immediately before the RTS).<br /><br />I don't use PHY/PLY anywhere in the &quot;someplace&quot; routine because Y isn't modified; but you could add it there just as a safety net if you wanted, no harm done (other than some CPU cycles wasted).

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />No I got it. <br /><br />Celius, I think he was just using that to abbreviate TAX -&gt; PHA.  I knew what he meant.  Unless I'm mistaken.<br /><br />But Koitsu, yeah, I get it.  I was misreading Rainwarriors meaning (specified in the edit).  I get it.  I had a moment of revelation when Nostromo posted that visual example.  It was the exact same thing EVERYONE was saying, but seeing it like that for some reason just kicked over whatever blockage was happening in my brain.<br /><br />JSR puts a value into the stack.  Without the RTS, the value never gets pulled.  So when I was JMPing out of the subroutine, there was leftover junk in the stack, and I'm pretty sure that's what was causing the problem.  I may have done this in other places too, so I'll have to go back through and check.  I wasn't making the correlation between JSRing and the stack...I understood using PHA PLA to push and pull the accumulator the stack, but just didn't know (or at least, didn't factor) that JSR RTS also pushed and pulled to the stack.  <br /><br />Thanks for all the input - sorry for being so dense!  haha

They get mentioned here once in a while).
