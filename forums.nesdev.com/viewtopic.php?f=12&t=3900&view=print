		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Hi everyone,
<br />
<br />I'm a MD programmer, and I've been working for quite some time on a sound engine for MD. While I've had lots of headache (doing insane optimizations), MD has quite some power in its sound part (its just it wasn't utilized by most games). Z80 is a pain sometimes.
<br />Here's a demo of my work (sounds best on real HW, but Kega Fusion is good enough, other emus certainly aren't) <a href="http://www.hot.ee/tmeeco3/TMFPLAY2.RAR" class="postlink">http://www.hot.ee/tmeeco3/TMFPLAY2.RAR</a>
<br />(BTW, my engine is used in "Pier Solar and the great Architects", the most kickass MD RPG to be released).
<br />
<br />I'd like to know what SNES can do, what are the main limitations, what causes the most amount of trouble ? How easy would be to make a sound engine and all related tools from scratch ?
<br />
<br />-Tiido

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />The biggest difference is that you use instrument samples instead of FM parameters, so you can't as easily adjust the timbre in real-time. The SNES has a separate sound processor with 64K of private RAM. All communication with the main SNES processor is via 4 8-bit I/O ports; RAM is NOT shared. It's similar to the 6502, but more flexible, and a lot more pleasant than the Z-80 in my opinion. That controls a DSP which can play 8 independent voices of a looped sample at an adjustable rate, with independent left/right panning. The samples are stored in a compressed delta format with an adjustable low-pass filter to remove the high-frequency noise introduced by the compression. Notes get a configurable volume envelope with lots of adjustments. There's also an adjustable-delay echo with low-pass FIR filter and adjustable feedback.

<br />I'm not sure what you're talking about that filter here. The only configurable filter I know in the SPC700 is the echo-filter, which isn't compulsary a low-pass, it's a FIR filter you you can make it both lowpass or highpass if you like.
<br />The samples are compressed in blocks of 16 samples, there is 4 modes possible : The first is "uncompressed", you directly get 4-bit samples. That is the most pratical one, but without a doubt the worst sounding one, as all samples are 4-bit (altrough the main step can be chosen). The second is delta compressed, and the last 2 are kind of delta of delta compressed. That's not quite it, but check any SPC doccumentation for more details.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />The sound processor can't get data form ROM area, right ? All must be in the tiny 64KB RAM ? So for example, playing a sound stream is quite some pain (if not impossible) ? I can't really imagine fitting much into 64KB, even when the samples are ADPCM, samples are only 50% smaller... my demo uses almost 400KB of samples, ADPCM them, its 200KB, remove different pitched samples and leave in 1 (i.e toms, few cymbals), its maybe 100KB then... I would need to do lots of cutting, especially when I need sound effects too. Also there's room needed for sound engine itself, and music data...
<br />
<br />How fast is the sound processor (thinking of software waveforms) ?

<br />It's possible to update samples in real time while they are playing, Tales of Phantasia does this. This isn't really easy I guess, however. I guess the SPU runs quite fast.

<br />
<br />Well, only big limitation is the fact that SPU can't look into ROM itself... I can't do things which I can do on MD on SNES then... damn
<br />
<br />I'll cross out SNES form my "going to dev for" list.

<br />The last three you describe apply a low-pass IIR filter to get rid of the high frequency noise introduced by the compression. Look more closely at the docs and you'll see that this is the case. And this is why samples on the SNES can be much smaller, because you can lower the sample rate more without introducing stair steps (these are what the low-pass filter removes). And you can lower the playback rate as well, since the gaussian interpolation will also eliminate stair-steps.

<br />More like 56 percent. A lot of games for MD and GBA use 8-bit samples.

<br />Yeah, gaussian interpolation is done while resampling, not while decoding the sample. I think what you say is a filter is the weird formula to decode the samples, which is kind of fun to play with. You can really make a lot of different samples with really short string of 3 or 4 blocks looping over themselves by arranging them in some way. Few other SPUs can do this.

<br />Read 4-bit signed nibble.
<br />Shift left by scaling in header.
<br />Apply "weird formula to decode the samples".
<br />
<br />That "weird formula to decode the samples" is an IIR filter. The filter combines the current sample with the previous two in four different ways. Below, input is the current sample, prev [-1] is the previous, and prev [-2] is the one before that:
<br />
<br />0: out = input
<br />1: out = input + prev [-1] * 0.9375
<br />2: out = input + prev [-1] * 1.90625  - prev [-2] * 0.9375
<br />3: out = input + prev [-1] * 1.796875 - prev [-2] * 0.8125
<br />
<br />Looks a lot like an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinite_impulse_response#Description_of_block_diagram" class="postlink">IIR filter</a>, doesn't it? That's because it is.

BTW, I'm doing 2 digital channels in my engine and has anyone cared to listen my MD ROM ?
<br />And what's the highest rate the samples can be played on SNES ?
