The game checks for PAL/NTSC at startup and adjusts music pitch to sound right on both consoles, but there is no compensation for the speed of the music and gameplay. PAL will feel a little more sluggish.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">tepples wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">If the finished product is as good as these first two missions, I'm pretty sure I'll want the finished product on a cartridge.

<br />Sorry, none of that. I am surprised people are actually asking for this, though. It's just that money will not help at all (unless it is magically enough to make a living off <img src="./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" />).

<br />
<br />The game is great, nothing to say against. the only thing is that it should show you how to use the new features that you received a little bit or explain how to use them.  The only reason that I new somehow how to go forward was because I saw the video.
<br />
<br />This is why Bregalad mention that he's stuck in level 1.   I don't know what would be the best approach to explain but usually some hint from the bird or other character after you receive it could be a possibility.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Hmm, indeed. I try to avoid relying on text as much as possible, at least when it comes to explaining essential gameplay mechanics. Not just because small kids should be able to play the game, but because not using text is a more elegant solution in many cases.
<br />
<br />Did you have problems finding out how the level 2 ability works? I guess not, because it is obvious what you have to do.
<br />
<br />The huge problem with the level 1 upgrade, however, is that you can backtrack and go another way with the new ability, get close to the secret door and then wonder why you can't continue. It's not obvious enough you have to punch the block (which isn't any different from the others surrounding it) in the same room you find the upgrade to continue.
<br />Feedback like this is extremely important, so thanks! <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />

<br />I'm exceptionally impressed by how well the game memorises defeated enemies (so <em>those damn bats</em> won't respawn immediately like Rockman hell) and destroyed blocks. I found the game manage destroyed blocks a bit <em>too</em> well though, as accidentally sending an exploding bat onto a destroyable platform can force you to do some difficult jumps.
<br />Anyway, congratulation on finishing the demo and I surely am looking forward to seeing the full game!  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" />

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Yeah, but it may still be possible that they could pay a little more attention to details and used a small fraction of the (tight) internal 2KB of RAM and made the game less irritating to have the enemies not respawning <em>immediately</em>.
<br />
<br />It's a common problem for games in that era though, even games designed for the FDS (which at least has more amount of RAM in total, though the memory also has to be used for PRG data) often had this problem, where there shouldn't be that much of an excuse. One particular example is Akamajou Dracula. This makes me think either the programmers were used to programming on simple cart mappers and didn't want to invest much on the potential of the disk system (one example is that few FDS games really used the extra PWM sound channel), or they already expected to release the game in cart format at a later time, either for the western market or a local Japanese version (both happened to Akamajou), at least the FDS version of Akamajou had save game feature though. (Zelda I was a good example, that enemies in a room won't respawn until you have walked several rooms away from it.)
<br />
<br />AFAIK Rockman was originally for the FDS too.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I just played through the demo and I'm on the extra level.  My advice is: DON'T give too many hints as to where you should use power-ups, and what those power-ups do.  The sense of discovery of these techniques is half the fun of games like these.
<br />
<br />The music is great, play control excellent, graphics atmospheric and cute.  It's fab!
<br />
<br />HOWEVER: You need more palette swapping of backgrounds between the hub, level I, II, extra, caves....  All orange for every level gets tiresome quickly.  Also, how about using the last unused(?) BG palette for other colourful things inside the background, like vines, granite, etc.  Look at how Duck Tales does it in the Amazon.  As it is, the colours of your levels are a bit flat.
<br />
<br />Also, your game has a lot of challenge with the physics engine, but the rest of the game feels sparse and empty.  More enemy placement and incidental sprites/graphics would make the game feel less lonely and less of just a physics engine challenge.
<br />
<br />I hope you find this criticism useful.
