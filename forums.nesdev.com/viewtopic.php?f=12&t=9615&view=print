		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />So I been off from this site for a while, I been working in a lot of thinks and learning new stuff.<br /><br />A while back I talked about a new SNES multicart I wanted to release, and further back, I was talking about hiring someone to make a new SNES game.<br /><br />Well, both projects kind of merged together, and they turned into a pilot project for me, to get an idea of how things work when you are releasing new games/homebrew carts<br /><br />I talked to known developers of this forum, I had read they were working or had made new snes Homebrew games.<br /><br />I came to an agreement with them and got the &quot;rights&quot; to release their games. (3 developers, 4 games)<br /><br />After researching, talking to some members here, and members of other forums, It came to the conclusion of being a very hard almost impossible way to combine all games in one ROM, but there was another route I could take.<br /><br />With a different method, technically unkown to me, I was able to find a way to have all those homebrew games in one cart.<br /><br />The games are very known to all of you:<br /><br />Mazezam Remake by Akelmaul (Winner of the NEOFlash 2012 comp)<br />UWOL The quest of Money by the Mojo Twins, ported by Akelmaul<br />N-warp Daisakusen by D4s (released in 2008)<br />Skipp and Friends by Mukunda Jhonson (Winned of the PDroms.com comp)<br /><br />All these games have different specs, some of them are Lo-rom and some Hi-rom, which I thought that was not going to be a problem. Without telling further details, I was able to get in my hands a prototype of the multicart and how it would work.<br /><br />See Video-<br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://youtu.be/RGhxovxXxvI">http://youtu.be/RGhxovxXxvI</a><!-- m --><br /><br />The Multicart has a &quot;loveless Menu&quot; as a youtube member comments on the video which lets you choose between the games available.<br /><br />The board -<br /><br /><a href="http://retroquestgames.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/prototype.jpg" class="postlink">Extra WIIIIIDE image</a><br /><br />It is an older design of board which resembles to some of the off brand/pirate snes games back in the day.<br /><br />The game is supposed to play Both PAL and NTSC, but I have not tested since I do not own a PAL game.<br /><br />I was able to get a Mold of the SNES NTSC cart done, and now I have the possibility to produce the SNES cart shells.<br /><br />The shells are  &quot;Screwless&quot; and shut by pressure, although it sounds odd, it is convenient and actually they are pretty nice, Im impressed. Also Same place where I get the Cart Shells done Can make me Dust covers, so this is a little extra touch, I was able to get done.<br /><br />At the end, the project is still under dev, as I need to start designing, label, box, manual, etc etc etc, and my plan is to make a kickstarter to fund the production run, as my pockets emptied with all the prototype stuff, Mold, etc.<br /><br />I will say that even though it was a bit controversial, Selling reproductions helped out in funding this, and they helped me understand little by little how a snes cart works, and a bit about the ROMs etc. Also, I invested a lot of Time in learning how to do boxes, and manuals, and developing my own method to produce boxes and make them feel like the old days ones.<br /><br />Anyways, let me know what you guys think, and if you guys show any interest in future projects too.<br /><br />Like i said, this is just my first one of many.<br /><br />Im aiming at at least 250 CIB sold games, as my minimum production run has to be of 500, so we'll see how it goes.
