		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />After starting on an NROM devcart, giving up, and waiting three months, I finally got a hacked Mario board to play Ice Climber!
<br /><a href="http://2a03.dnsalias.com/tv.jpg" class="postlink"><img src="http://2a03.dnsalias.com/tv_s.jpg" alt="Image" /></a>
<br />I know this isn't anything new, but it's the first NES hardware project I actually got working.  Oddly, the two EPROM sockets are each connected to the main board differently.  The PRG EPROM is socketed on a small circuit board with a whole bunch of individual wires reaching to the main board.
<br /><a href="http://2a03.dnsalias.com/step1.jpg" class="postlink"><img src="http://2a03.dnsalias.com/step1_s.jpg" alt="Image" /></a>
<br />After finishing the PRG socket, I realized that there was an easier method and hacked the CHR socket directly onto the main board (with four of the pins bent under/cut off).
<br /><a href="http://2a03.dnsalias.com/socket1.jpg" class="postlink"><img src="http://2a03.dnsalias.com/socket1_s.jpg" alt="Image" /></a>
<br />On the downside, the solder-coated sockets feel really fragile when pulling EPROMS.  It doesn't look like much, but this taught me a few things, namely that hardware hacking is harder than it looks, and that it is possible to hum the Legend of Zelda title theme for three hours without going insane (much).  Anyway, I'll be building another one of these with a pair of ZIF sockets and a mirroring switch starting tomorrow.  And, if anyone needs an A+ example of terrible soldering, I've got one.

<br />I'm at the process of make a similar move, but I'll try CNROM and UNROM.
<br />
<br />And thanks for post some pics of your work. This can be very useful!
<br />
<br />One question: how did you burn the EPROMS? Some home made EPROM project or you did you purchase one?

<br />
<br />drk421:  I would have used a 27C256 EPROM, but I had a pile of 32-pin 128KiB ones that weren't being used.
<br />
<br />I'm going to start on an AOROM or CNROM cart soon, but I'll need to order some parts first.  The local Radio Shack doesn't seem to carry 74161 (or anything other than octal flip-flops and BASIC stamps).

<br />
<br />What about the willem cost?
<br />
<br />I have a mid level EPROM eraser project. Seems a very good one, but I never tried to build it (seems a little difficult). I have it on an electronics magazine.
<br />
<br />I'd be happy in send you the scans, but I don't know about the instructions, seems it's write in portuguese. However, if you're interested, you can contact me any time.  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /> 
<br />
<br />And there's this links to some simple projects:
<br />

<br />
<br />Besides, do you consider to put more scans of your project? I'd like to see a zoom in of your board, or so.

<br />Better yet, put a switch on it, so that if the game crashes it doesn't write over itself.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I put together the simplest eprom eraser I could think of. I ordered a UVC fluorescent tube from the aquarium store I go to and bought a cheap little fixture from the local hardware place. I think the bulb was $20 and the fixture was $10 (Canadian $). I just lean the EPROM's next to the bulb, wait 20 minutes and it works every time. On my bulb I can fit 10 EPROM's at a time (32 pin ones). I could put more in if I modified the fixture.
