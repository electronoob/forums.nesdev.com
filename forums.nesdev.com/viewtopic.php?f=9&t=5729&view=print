		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />The PowerPak has the potential to run any commercially NES game/ROM, and runs about 99% of them perfectly (I am not including Famicom here).  Testing the ROMs with the latest combination of the PowerPak (Boot ROM 1.11, Mapper Pak 1.30 &amp; Resistor Fix), here are some of my results.
<br />
<br />I have only tested NES and a few Famicom (Disk) Games
<br />
<br />Dirty Harry - The War Against Drugs (U) [!p].nes
<br />Paperboy (U) [!].nes
<br />
<br />No input recognized from NES controller.  The ROM Paperboy (U) [f1].nes works fine.  
<br />
<br />Karnov (U) [!].nes
<br />
<br />Severe background graphical glitching. 
<br />
<br />Bandit Kings of Ancient China (U) [!p].nes
<br />Castlevania III - Dracula's Curse (U) [!].nes
<br />Gemfire (U) [!].nes
<br />Laser Invasion (U) [!].nes
<br />Nobunaga's Ambition 2 (U) [!p].nes
<br />Romance of The Three Kingdoms II (U) [!].nes
<br />Uncharted Waters (U) [!].nes
<br />
<br />MMC5 is not fully implemented, shows a black screen.
<br />
<br />Batman - Return of the Joker (U) [!].nes
<br />
<br />Shows just a solid grey screen.  Worked (mostly) with Boot ROM 1.00 and Mappers 1.00.
<br />
<br />Hot Slot (Unl).nes
<br />Severe graphical glitches past title screen.
<br />
<br />Peek-A-Boo Poker (Unl) [!].nes
<br />Severe graphical glitches in female full-screen portraits.
<br />
<br />Metroid v1.01 (1986)(Nintendo).fds - Metroid v1.02 (1986)(Nintendo).fds
<br />Any version of Metroid for the fds will either refuse to load a game, or will load to a severely glitched screen, with Samus unable to move.  The graphics glitches start to show themselves when it asks the player to set side B.  
<br />
<br />Interestingly, Low-G-Man did not display any sound glitches at all during the first boss battle.  Both Punch-Outs!! worked without glitches, as did the rest of the FDS games I tried.  Games like Alien Syndrome and Death Race worked fine as far as I could tell.  Games that Nestopia assigns Mapper 206 also worked with the exception of Karnov.  
<br />
<br />In evert case, I used NTSC versions of the games, as that is my region.  All ROMs were from the GoodNES 3.14 set.

<br />
<br />If that is so, then I would guess that similar problems would also be encountered in Bubble Bath Babes (Unl) [!].nes, even though it is assigned Mapper 3.  Four pages would be the canonical Nintendo limit.

<br />How 256? I thought the maximum CHR length was 255 pages, and value 0 represented something like CPROM but with 8 KiB CHR RAM switching instead of 4 KiB.
<br />
<br />As I understand it, the difference between official CNROM and clone boards is as follows:
<br />
<br />CNROM <ul><li>runs CPU D0-D1 and D4-D5 to 74HC161 inputs D0-D1 and D2-D3 </li><li>uses Q0-Q1 from the 161 as the bank number </li><li>may run Q2-Q3 through diodes as a copy protection measure </li></ul>Clone boards <ul><li>run CPU D0-D3 through the 161 </li><li>use Q0-Q3 as the bank number </li></ul>

<br />
<br />MMC5 is known to be unsupported so far. Would be nice if it worked atleast partially.
<br />
<br />Metroid on FDS worked for me at some point. Never had any problem as you describe.

<br />
<br />I did not test extensively, but I do not experience anything like that on the PowerPak.  The small graphics glitches haven't really affected gameplay, but I can also confirm they don't exist with a real Crystalis game pak.  [/code]
