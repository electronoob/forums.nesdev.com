<br />Would this transfer cable connect to the NES (like Flash2Advance) or to the cartridge (like EFA-Linker)? If the cartridge, then you'd have to remove the cart from the NES every time, as opposed to just removing the CF from the PowerPak. If the NES, you'd need a failsafe boot ROM because the NES doesn't have a built-in "multiboot" client like the GBA does.
<br />
<br />In addition, device drivers under 64-bit Windows generally have to be digitally signed. If you turn on the option to accept a self-signed certificate instead of a $200/year one, you'll get annoying always-on-top "Test Mode" warnings in all four corners of the screen. And no, running Linux or 32-bit Windows in a virtual machine doesn't count because the virtual machine's USB forwarder itself needs a signed driver.

<br />
<br />Are you sure about that?
<br />
<br />At work I have a Windows 7-64 bit desktop pc.  On that PC I run VMWare Workstation 6.5 and Virtual Box 3.something.  In both I have VMs that run unsigned 32-bit drivers on Windows XP and Windows 2000.  I can also run a full USB stack on Gentoo Linux inside a VM.  VMWare and VirtualBox ship with signed usb-shim drivers for the host OS.
<br />
<br />I'm pretty confident that generic USB devices plugged into a host, and tunneled to the guest, can be accessed on the guest using libusb or other non-device specific communications code.  I do this with several developmental image scanners.

<br />But the libusb driver itself needs to be signed to run on 64-bit Windows (except in a VM whose USB forwarder is signed), and as of today, it isn't because it has no corporate sponsor.

<br />
<br />I would say it connects to the cartridge, and by extension, to the NES.  Nothing would be more boring than a communication channel on an NES cart, that the NES couldn't talk to, heheh.  So it would need to be in the NES (it's powered by it, and can be controlled by it), the only thing in the way is the cart door on a front-loader, and of course there's no problem with leaving that open during use.  The cable would emerge from the finger-grip area of the cart shell, just like it does on MidiNES.
<br />
<br />For a failsafe boot ROM (admittedly this was a problem with all of my older designs, because I really didn't want to write-protect the boot sector - I guess it would have helped if I had finished ROM code <img src="./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" />) I've got a solution that will be 100% un-brick-able <em>and</em> effortless to update, at least for my future Squeedo rev3 (which I've been pushing back further while developing other stuff, but I've been learning a lot throughout the process).
<br />
<br />I guess I hadn't considered 64-bit operating systems, but that's not surprising because I've never heard of anyone who hasn't had a problem with them.  Though my own PC's CPU is 64-bit, and with more RAM than I can use, I haven't seriously considered upgrading to 64-bit (at least, not while I can expect to run into problems with it).  At any rate I'm definitely not gonna be writing an OS drivers for it, if it's needed I'll leave that to Microchip or whatever vendor made the chip I end up using (tho I'm pretty sure PIC32 will remain in the design).

<br />
<br />Rather than clone it you could probably take a MMC3 board and heavily modify it to make your own Mega Man 6-in-1 cartridge. You just need to construct a master mapper to control whether the Menu or one of the 6 games is selected. It probably wouldn't be that hard. You'd just select approprate CHR-ROM chips for MM3 &amp; 5 and CHR-RAM for the rest. Then also the appropriate PRG-ROM chips for each other. MM1 &amp; 2 would need to be hacked to run on MMC3 but that shouldn't be a huge deal. Since 7 is an odd number ( Menu + 6 games) you could probably throw in that Rockman Board game to round it out. That or just latch the free slot (assuming you have eight) to also be the menu I guess.

<br />MM3: 256+128 KiB TLROM (MMC3)

<br />MM6: 512 KiB TGROM (MMC3)
<br />
<br />Total PRG ROM: 1920 KiB, just shy of a 16 Mbit flash.  I'd put the menu in MM1's segment.
<br />Total CHR ROM: 384 KiB; use a 4 Mbit flash.
<br />
<br />UNROM-to-MMC3 appears doable in all cases. But how does MM2 configure the MMC1's banks? Does it use any modes other than switchable $8000/fixed $C000?
<br />
<br />It'd probably take one CPLD or a few 7400 series chips to implement the following behavior:
<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">7654 3210&nbsp; $6000-$7FFF: Bank select<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; |||<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; |||<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; +++- Switch 256 KiB bank<br /></div>
<br />Banks 0-1: MM4
<br />Banks 2-3: MM6
<br />Bank 4: MM1 and menu
<br />Bank 5: MM2
<br />Bank 6: MM3
<br />Bank 7: MM5
<br />
<br />In banks 0-3 (MM4 and MM6), the A18 output from the MMC3 is used and bit 0 is ignored.
<br />In banks 4-7 (MM1, MM2, MM3, MM5), the A18 output from the MMC3 is ignored and bit 0 runs to PRG ROM A18.
<br />
<br />In banks 0-5 (MM4, MM6, MM1, MM2), the CHR RAM is enabled and the CHR ROM is disabled.
<br />In banks 6-7 (MM3 and MM5), the CHR ROM is enabled and the CHR RAM is disabled. The low bit of the bank number controls CHR ROM A18.
