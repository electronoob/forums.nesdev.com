As for the <tt style="margin-left: 2px; margin-right: 2px; padding:3px; background-color: #3355aa; color: white;">stp</tt>, thank you, that's interesting. I will probably stick to the loop however as I intend to have a main, endless loop in there eventually.<br /><br />Still, after making those changes and rechecking everything, I still can't seem to change the color. Any clue on why that wouln't work?<br /><br />DoNotWant: that would be very kind of you! <a href="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/19680817/snes/WLA.zip" class="postlink">Here you go</a>.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I've found that leaving register $4200 at zero will work on really lenient emulators like ZSNES, but won't work for BSNES, SNES9x or on the real hardware, had to learn that the HARD way...heheh...sorry. If you play with the interrupt tables and the routines they call, I think you'll have a more intuitive understanding of how they work.<br /><br />It is also worthwhile to look at the actual SNES Developer manual:<br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.romhacking.net/documents/226/">http://www.romhacking.net/documents/226/</a><!-- m --><br /><br />It was useful for me trying to do some HSYNC effects that required specific settings, which the SNES DEV Manual covers that were helpful to know. Here is where I got in case you are curious:<br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://vimeo.com/85569649">https://vimeo.com/85569649</a><!-- m --><br /><br />Experiencing some hardware-specific graphic anomalies and I still haven't gotten the counters to work with any specificity (ie setting specific H or V Counter variables), but this seems to be working consistently enough for me.<br /><br />With regard to changing the color, I believe you do need $2121 before you specify the color. Think about it this way, the SNES needs to know the index of the color that you want to change the value of. Only the zeroth color is the &quot;bg&quot; color unless you create tiles and specify color indices within them.  If you were setting the palette you would need to know index number then color. You'd need to stz $2121 each time you try to change the color.<br /><br /> It is for WLA, but check out bazz's code:<br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://wiki.superfamicom.org/snes/show/Writing+Your+First+SNES+Program">http://wiki.superfamicom.org/snes/show/ ... ES+Program</a><!-- m --><br /><br />I've done something similar trying to get a &quot;rainbow effect&quot; based on bazz's code. I had to specify stz $2121 each time:<br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://instagram.com/p/iXay-ZP9T0">http://instagram.com/p/iXay-ZP9T0</a><!-- m --><br /><br />I am at work right now, but I can upload this later if it helps.

The reason it's affecting colour #0 is because you did <tt style="margin-left: 2px; margin-right: 2px; padding:3px; background-color: #3355aa; color: white;">stz $2121</tt> in Snes_Init (which is correct/fine).<br /><br />Now look a few lines forward, where you do this -- WITHOUT setting/touching $2121 prior:<br /><br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">...<br />lda&nbsp; &nbsp;#%00011111<br />sta&nbsp; &nbsp;$2122<br />lda&nbsp; &nbsp;#%00000000<br />sta&nbsp; &nbsp;$2122<br />...<br /></div><br /><br />What this is affecting is colour #1 in the palette, not colour #0 like you might think.  This is because you didn't re-set/change $2121.<br /><br />Basically what I'm saying is this, speaking using code:<br /><br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">stz $2121&nbsp; &nbsp; ; Next writes to $2122 affect colour #0<br /><br />lda #$whatever<br />sta $2122<br />lda #$whatever<br />sta $2122<br /><br />lda #$whatever&nbsp; ; These writes affect colour #1<br />sta $2122<br />lda #$whatever<br />sta $2122<br /><br />lda #$whatever&nbsp; ; These writes affect colour #2<br />sta $2122<br />lda #$whatever<br />sta $2122<br /><br />...<br /></div><br /><br />Make sense?  So you need to set $2121 to the colour you want to modify before touching $2122.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Thanks again to everyone, I have been having a lot of fun playing around with SNES code. I was surprised how little time it took to find a case where emulation accuracy mattered! The SNES initialization routine I was using didn't clear VRAM properly, so while most emulators (including bsnes v077 and older) loaded my ROM &quot;beautifully&quot;, more recent versions of bsnes/higan and real hardware showed junk aplenty.<br /><br />Anyway, I have a few more quick questions. I have been trying to implement the most basic detector of MSU1 presence, unsuccessfully so far. Super Road Blaster's source helped a lot, but I'm missing something.<br /><ul><li><a href="http://byuu.org/snes/msu1/specification/" class="postlink">byuu's page on MSU1 specifications</a> uses a memory mapping notation ($00-3f,80-bf:2000-2007) I'm not familiar with, despite some Googling. I would greatly appreciate some help with this.</li><li>Would a simple <tt style="margin-left: 2px; margin-right: 2px; padding:3px; background-color: #3355aa; color: white;">lda $2002</tt> placed shortly after my SNES initialization routine read the first MSU1 presence identifier, or there is some... special magic to do before?</li></ul><br />Thank you very much!

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Thank you for your reply! I see that it's indeed unused, but I'm not quite sure if I understand correctly: if <tt style="margin-left: 2px; margin-right: 2px; padding:3px; background-color: #3355aa; color: white;">$00-$3F</tt> and <tt style="margin-left: 2px; margin-right: 2px; padding:3px; background-color: #3355aa; color: white;">$80-$BF</tt> are bank addresses, does that mean that there are actually 128 banks on which the MSU1 registers are mirrored? That sounds quite a lot to me, so I guess I got something wrong.<br /><br />Also, if <tt style="margin-left: 2px; margin-right: 2px; padding:3px; background-color: #3355aa; color: white;">$002002-$002008</tt> is a correct address for reading the MSU1 presence identificator, I must be doing something terribly wrong because I couldn't read these bytes correctly to save my life. Aside from Neviksti's InitSNES file, I barely have any code and yet can't manage to read those bytes as identified by snes9x's debugger's RAM viewer. The code below, which basically seems to loop through the 6 bytes to check, is mostly taken from the Super Road Blaster source:<br /><br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">.define MSU_ID $2002&nbsp; &nbsp;; 2002-2007 must return &quot;S-MSU1&quot;<br /><br />.BANK 0 SLOT 0<br />.ORG 0<br />.SECTION &quot;MainCode&quot;<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;Start:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;InitSNES<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;rep #$31<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;sep #$20<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;ldx.w #0<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;l1:&nbsp; &nbsp;lda.l MSU_ID,x<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;cmp.l msu1HardwareIdentifier,x<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;bne NoMSU1<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;inx<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;cpx #msu1HardwareIdentifier.end-msu1HardwareIdentifier<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;bne l1<br /><br />...<br /><br />.Section &quot;msu1HardwareString&quot; superfree<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;msu1HardwareIdentifier:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;.db &quot;S-MSU1&quot;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;msu1HardwareIdentifier.end:<br />.ENDS<br /></div><br />I have a last question for today. During the InitSNES routine (again from Neviksti), there's <tt style="margin-left: 2px; margin-right: 2px; padding:3px; background-color: #3355aa; color: white;">STA $420B</tt>, which clears some memory by doing a DMA transfer, from what I understand. Somehow, the snes9x debugger tells me that this single instruction clears <tt style="margin-left: 2px; margin-right: 2px; padding:3px; background-color: #3355aa; color: white;">$002000-$0020FF</tt> (among other addresses) completely. If theses addresses are what I think they are, is there any reason for clearing them (aren't they unused?)?.<br /><br />Thank you again for your help and patience!

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />&gt; if $00-$3F and $80-$BF are bank addresses, does that mean that there are actually 128 banks on which the MSU1 registers are mirrored? That sounds quite a lot to me<br /><br />Yes, that's how the SNES works. Same deal for all your regular registers, $2100 and such. It's a problem when DBR.d6 is set, eg: lda #$40; pha; plb; stz $2100 &lt;- does not write to display register, as $402100 is not an MMIO region, it's a CART (ROM) address.<br /><br />&gt; Also, if $002002-$002008 is a correct address for reading the MSU1 presence identificator, I must be doing something terribly wrong because I couldn't read these bytes correctly to save my life.<br /><br />With higan v094, you need a manifest.bml file to specify that the MSU1 is present. With sd2snes, you need a gamename.msu file to specify that it's present.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Please just post the code to this InitSNES routine.  I'm getting a little tired of it continually coming up in every post without seeing the actual code (not to mention what you brought up initially was called Snes_Init, now you're using something called InitSNES).  If I review it and I see nothing wrong with it (going purely off of what official documentation mandates), then I really couldn't care less what an emulator &quot;claims&quot; it's doing in this particular case.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Thank you byuu, this is very helpful.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">koitsu wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">Please just post the code to this InitSNES routine.  I'm getting a little tired of it continually coming up in every post without seeing the actual code (not to mention what you brought up initially was called Snes_Init, now you're using something called InitSNES).</div><br />I'm sorry about not having posted it; I had figured the code was generally considered OK since it is used in different tutorials and written by &quot;big names&quot; of emulation, but you're right, that's definitely not a good assumption to make, and switching between the two files can be confusing. I used <a href="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/19680817/snes/dev/Snes_Init.asm" class="postlink">Snes_Init.asm</a> first from <a href="http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Super_NES_Programming" class="postlink">this tutorial</a>, but found it was missing stuff, so I switched to <a href="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/19680817/snes/dev/InitSNES.asm" class="postlink">InitSNES.asm</a> from <a href="http://wiki.superfamicom.org/snes/show/HomePage#bazzs_tutorials_10" class="postlink">these tutorials</a>. You can download all my current project files <a href="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/19680817/snes/dev/2014-03-06%20-%20MSU1%20detection%20test.7z" class="postlink">here</a>.<br /><br />Again, I'm sorry for not posting everything before; I thought I'd try to post the most relevant code only so that reading my posts isn't too much of a chore. I'll post the whole thing from now on. Please forgive my language as well, I'm not very used to write in English.
