If you don't want somebody copying your design, you could always just not publish the schematics.  You mentioned in your other post how you were concerned about how people would react to you profiting off of the information that you've learned here.  Making money is one thing, but a patent might be a bit much.  Also, if you produce the carts yourself, a lot of people would probably be willing to buy it just to have a complete product rather than building it themselves.  Just look at the SD2SNES.  ikari has released the full schematics, PCB files, source code, basically everything that you would need to build an entire SD2SNES from scratch, but he still sells them because building one is actually a lot of work.  Personally, I don't see the point of a patent here.

Here is some food for thought.<br /><br />While I may not know about the costs or frustrations of filing a patent, I can confidently say that is probably good practice, even for a project not so wholesomely worthy of a patent. It is good practice, perhaps?;  To gain the practice of filing a patent, this early.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Good practice?  But for what benefit really.  That's a pretty large investment and process to go through just for 'good practice'.  I wouldn't be surprised if the patent process was more time consuming and certainly more expensive than what you've invested in the project yourself.<br /><br />The only benefit is that you have grounds to stand on if you'd like to sue someone for stealing your work.  It doesn't actually stop them, just gives you a case should you decide that it's worth your time and money to take them to court.<br /><br />There are plenty of much simpler ways to protect your work if you'd like to keep people from stealing it.  Making it so they'd effectively have to create the entire thing from the ground up is probably more than enough deterence if you're really concerned.  As for patenting the idea of MIDI on a SNES connector I'm not sure it's really an patentable invention.  People should be allowed to create their own completely different implementation of a MIDI port on a SNES connector should they choose too.<br /><br />I wouldn't bother trying to get a patent just for the sake of getting one and being able to say you have one.  Unless it were something you intended to mass produce and sell on a large scale, there isn't much point IMO.

MIDI too, I would guess there are fees to use it in a hardware project, like ones that SD card or MP3 technologies has.<br /><br />MIDI port on a game system cart in general is certainly not something original that could be patented, has been done before (as tepples ninja'd).

It seems the idea has been manifested in other areas, that financially and actually how the patent can be used is of no interest to me when not even a prototype is built. I am glad I motioned to ask these questions instead of them lying dormant inside of me.<br /><br />I will make a motion to ask the creator of midines how he felt in the design process. Or a guide to follow when designing your next biggest project, slash first project that may reach a market.<br /><br />I am a college undergrad.<br /><br />Thanks guys for your trustworthy feedback.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I am under the impression that patents are only useful for an idea/implementation that is extremely universal and highly applicable/desired.<br /><br />For instance, say that tracker console software/hardware as I am designing became a sought after goal, and future designers started implementing the same general design except for <span style="text-decoration: underline">different systems</span>. So, had I patented the universal design, does that mean these similar designs fall under my patent; can be sued by me? Is that the point of having a patent. Ensuring you make money off a branch of your universal idea/design? <br /><br />Then, when I brought this thread up, someone mentioned, The GAmeboy Camera already did the 'tracker on a console' type thing. -- So, what? Are you saying they have a patent for that already? OR, that the prior physical manifestation of something like my idea is enough to prevent my own patent of the idea?<br /><br />I'm asking all of these questions less because I want a patent, more because I want to understand how it works.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />The actual intent wouldn't be suing, it would be licensing, that you would have a patent that other companies would have to license from you in order to incorporate your invention into their product. You would sue if they used it without licensing. The &quot;patent it so we can sue&quot; attitude rose out of patent trolling, where companies just file for (or purchase) as many patents as they possibly can, then go around finding anybody with anything even remotely resembling their patent and suing, with the thought that prohibitive legal fees will lead a lot of their targets to just settle out of court. I would say that the only reason you'd want a patent is if you actually intend to monetize it, either through licensing or otherwise. If you're just looking to protect your work from copying, obfuscate the design, e.g. with programmable hardware and closed source. You probably can't physically protect against someone sufficiently skilled and motivated (though I would think the threat would be fairly low), the question is one of LEGALLY protecting it, and whether it's worth it.
