<br />
<br />On the wiki about <a href="http://nesdevwiki.org/index.php/NES_PPU#PPUSCROLL_.28.242005.29" class="postlink">$2005</a>, it says to read from $2002 first. What I don't understand is how do you actually use/implement PPUSCROLL?

<br />Those locations are within the stack. When you first TXS, which value are you loading into the stack pointer?
<br />
<br />Oh, and setting the scroll should be done <em>after</em> you finish loading the nametables. The register inside the PPU that holds the X/Y scroll position is the same register that holds the VRAM read/write address.

<br />I made a seperate routine to place the values, which takes place after my background is pulled in (I'm not sure what values to use, honestly):
<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">scroll_values:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;lda #$20<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;sta VScroll<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;lda #$00<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;sta HScroll</div><br /><br />This is early coding, so nothing else is in the nmi<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">nmi:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;pha<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;txa<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;pha<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;tya<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;pha<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;jsr scroll_it<br />end_nmi:&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;pla<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;tay<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;pla<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;tax<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;pla<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;rti</div><br /><br />This is the routine called in nmi:<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">scroll_it:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;bit $2007<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;lda HScroll<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;sta $2005<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;lda VScroll<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;sta $2005<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;rts</div>
<br />
<br />
<br />This is a bit different than I thought it'd be. I figured it would just start the scrolling. It looks like all it did is shift the nametable. If it makes any difference, right now I'm using vertical mirroring, though I have switched the header to reflect horizontal and gotten the same kind of effect (shifted nametable).

<br />- It's possible to place variables at $1fe and $1ff, but then you have to make sure you place your stack pointer somewhere else... As long as you have enough RAM free I'd say avoid putting everything in $100-$1ff, but use this pace as extra RAM if you run out of it.
<br />Also consider $2000.0 to be the "9th H scrolling bit" and $2000.1 the "9th V scrolling bit", it often help understanding. Only one of these is significant, depending on the mirroring.
<br />I recommand writing to $2000 each VBlank after setting $2005 (you technically don't have to, but that's the way everyone handles it).

<br />Oops, 2007 wasn't intended, but now fixed. Just a brain fart while typing.
<br />
<br />I'm still at a loss. Am I supposed to be coding some increments or something to get this to scroll, or is it just supposed to move on it's own? If it's the latter, it sure isn't right now. I feel like this shouldn't be that difficult. I must be overlooking something.

<br />Yes. The correct way to do is when it's zero and you want to decrement it directly write $ef for proper scrolling.
<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">&nbsp;lda VScroll<br />&nbsp;sec<br />&nbsp;sbc #$01<br />&nbsp;bcs +<br />&nbsp;lda #$ef<br />+sta VScroll</div>
<br />Also I'd recommand switching to vertical mirroring if you want the same background scrolling over and over again, or fill the nametable #2 with something. Also it's the first time I see a ROM with 4KB CHRROM.

<br />
<br />Well, I was going to make a little something in the 4KB range for the mini-game competition, so I was putting both background and sprites in the same tileset to bring down the size (I'm guessing it would help). I was planning on using the competition to learn how to do some compression. It was down originally, but now it seems to be up again (the page for the competition, that is). I doubt I'm going to submit anything to it now because I'd rather just get a game that's more than a basic demo, regardless of size. We'll see though. I guess it's a good thing that lines can be commented out and such, great for experimenting ;)

<br />You don't <em>have</em> to read PPUSTATUS. It's just recommended for these reasons: <ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha"><li>Reading PPUSTATUS acknowledges the NMI. </li><li>A flag inside the PPU tells it whether to expect a first write or a second write, and reading PPUSTATUS sets this flag to a known state. </li></ol>
