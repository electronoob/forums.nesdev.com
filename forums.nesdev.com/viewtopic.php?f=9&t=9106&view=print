		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Hello!
<br />I build a nes-on-a-proto-board. In fact, it is more like a Famicom. It looks like:
<br />
<br /><a href="http://obrazki.elektroda.net/48_1342724675.jpg" class="postlink"><img src="http://obrazki.elektroda.net/48_1342724675_thumb.jpg" alt="Image" /></a> 
<br />
<br />Bellow is a schematics.
<br />
<br /><a href="http://obrazki.elektroda.net/39_1342724886.png" class="postlink"><img src="http://obrazki.elektroda.net/39_1342724886_thumb.png" alt="Image" /></a> 
<br />
<br />There are also PPU and its ROM and RAM on the protoboard,
<br />but they re isolated from the CPU at the moment, I am goin to make the CPU working at
<br />first, so don't care about them.
<br />
<br />Basically it consists of a UA6527P CPU (found in many famiclones),
<br />29F040 512KB Flash-ROM and HM62256 32KB Static-RAM.
<br />
<br />The 74HC139 address decoder (connected in the same manner like in Famicom)
<br />generates enable signals for RAM and ROM (upon A13-A15 and M2 lines).
<br />Everythin is based on this popular famicom schematics:
<br /><a href="http://obrazki.elektroda.pl/8065347000_1323776847.jpg" class="postlink"><img src="http://obrazki.elektroda.pl/8065347000_1323776847_thumb.jpg" alt="Image" /></a> 
<br />
<br />I added a 74HC161 latch (found in UNROM/CNROM/ANROM cartridges) which
<br />latches lower 4 bits od data, stored at 8000-FFFF address. Four LED diodes
<br />are driven by its outputs, so that they shows what data was latched.
<br />
<br />So for example, when a 
<br />lda #%1010
<br />sta $8000
<br />opcodes are executed, LED2 and LED4 should be turned on and LED1 and LED3 off.
<br />
<br />The RAM !CE line is connected with a capacitor-diode-resistor circuit, same like in
<br />popular famicom schematics.
<br />I guess it was done to delay the high to low (or low to high, I dunno) transision
<br />of this line.
<br />
<br />The clock generating circuit is also the same like in the popular famicom schematics.
<br />The crystal is 24 MHz.
<br />
<br />There are couple of 100n capacitors, connected close to the ICs to eliminate the noise.
<br />Everything is powered with a 7805 regulator (with huge 1000u electrolic capacitors at input and output).
<br />The 7805 is driven with a 9v DC supply from transformer.
<br />
<br />I wrote a simple ASM program, which should ligh the diodes in a sequence
<br />LED1 LED2 LED3 LED4
<br />   1    0    0    0
<br />   0    1    0    0
<br />   0    0    1    0
<br />   0    0    0    1
<br />with a few second delay between them. Then I compiled it to a 32768 binary file
<br />and written on on 29F040 flash ROM (and I examined its contents - every byte is written correctly).
<br />The vector handlers adresses are also correct.
<br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://students.mimuw.edu.pl/~krzysiobal/nes-on-protoboard-rom.zip">http://students.mimuw.edu.pl/~krzysioba ... rd-rom.zip</a><!-- m -->
<br />
<br />However the problem is that the leds aren't blinking as I wanted - they behave
<br />quite randomly, blink fast for a fraction of a second and then they froze.
<br />The program does not even use the RAM.
<br />The connections on the protoboard were rechecked ten times, with a multimeter.
<br />Everything is like on the schematics.
<br />
<br />So my question is why this is not working <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /> Have I missed something? I think the sound and
<br />joypad extension ports on the CPU can be left floating, if not used.

<br />I have 7.3728MHz, 16MHz, 24MHz, 26MHz, 32MHz and 32.768 kHZ crystals. I can try to use the last one and see under logyc analyzer what addresses the CPU is outputing, but isn't that crystal too slow for that CPU? 
<br />
<br />I heard CMOS 6502 has no lower limit on crystal, but I doubt the one in the famiclone is CMOS.
<br />
<br />Also, this CPU cannot execute code step-by-step as far I remember (or can it?)

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I think the same, that something's wrong with the power supply.
<br />The whole circuitry draws 180mA  @ 5V, which makes the 7805 (with large radiator) very hot after a few minutes. Also, there is a significant voltage drop in the top part of breadboard, if the power supply is connected on the bottom of it and viceversa.

<br />
<br />Well, correct. It is just a simple 220AC -&gt; 13VDC transformer  with 4 rectifying diodes and large capacitor,  so thats why I can't touch 7805 after a few minutes <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />
<br />
<br />I tried to put the 32.768kHZ crystal but it didn't worked (it was too slow). And the 7.3728MHz was to fast. But i built a simple square wave generator using Atmega microcontroller which give me slow enought clock for my digital scope <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />
<br />
<br />Ok, so here goes the results.
<br />First - the code that the cpu has programmed on its rom:
<br /><a href="http://obrazki.elektroda.net/82_1342739696.png" class="postlink"><img src="http://obrazki.elektroda.net/82_1342739696_thumb.png" alt="Image" /></a> 
<br />
<br />
<br />Then - the scope. I could be able to monitor only 7 lowest address lines and PHI2 (M2 - the clock)
<br /><a href="http://obrazki.elektroda.net/66_1342739696.png" class="postlink"><img src="http://obrazki.elektroda.net/66_1342739696_thumb.png" alt="Image" /></a> 
<br />
<br />
<br />Okay, so after six dummy cycles, the cpu generated looked at the FFFC and FFFD addresses (red arrow). It got the values stored there (00, 80) and then jumped to 8000 and started executing opcodes (blue arrow).
<br />
<br />So the guys at <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.pagetable.com/?p=410">http://www.pagetable.com/?p=410</a><!-- m --> were right about six fake clocks :]
<br />
<br />If you trace cycle by cycle what happens next, you see that the cpu is executing opcodes correctly till 8017.
<br />After it gets bytes from 8017 and 8018 (the LDX #$01 opcode), it generates 7F (or FF) at lower address byte (green arrow with question mark). I completely don't know what is that and moreover, its execution from that moment is completely mysterious.
<br />
<br />It should fetch data byes at 8019, 801A and 801B but it doesnt do that in the future!

<br /><ul><li> DMC read DMA</li><li> IRQ, NMI</li></ul>Hm. You don't disable the DMC interrupt on power-up, and reading from FFFF,FFFE is consistent with that... although the order of the read is opposite the power-on FFFC,FFFD, which is disconcerting. But even then, your interrupts aren't at $8099 or $80a0, they're at $808f.
<br />
<br />Any chance you could redo the trace looking at D7..D3, D1..D0 instead?

<br />Do another but explain your process and what it all is, that would be a much better video than just showing it turn on and run.
