Somebody should get a bunch of people together and ask them to each draw a diagram of how they think the system works, and it will be interesting to compare and contrast their designs with both the real thing, and each others diagrams.  I wonder if there would be brothers who have been talking about technical stuff for years, suddenly realized they understood each other differently this entire time.

So any ASIC/CPLD/FPGA is a processor, as it will take some form of input, &quot;process&quot; it and then form an output. It does not even need a Clock let alone an Instruction set to be a processor. You can make a Processor board from discrete components as well. That is how computers were made before the invention of the IC, and then before and well still after the invention of the Microprocessor. My microwave oven proudly boasts that it is Microprocessor based, and that it is LSI ( yeah not even VLSI <img src="./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" /> )<br /><br />For me 8-bit graphics relies upon the rough resolutions and in turn amount of items one would see as possible for an 8 bit based computer to process. Its not just well is 320x240 16 colour and then its 8-bit, if it has screen high objects moving around and 25 other things moving then its not running on an 8-bit processor. The graphical limits refer more to &quot;what it can update&quot; rather than what it can &quot;render&quot;. I.e Mayhem in Monsterland can be considered to be 16bit graphics, as the graphical fidelity makes you question &quot;are you sure this is not an A600&quot;. <br />So for me, Shovel Night is not 8bit, Bloodmoon also not 8bit. Undertale is 8bit ( I think it even goes as far as having attribute clash ). Rock Bashers yeah 8bit. Aqua Kitty, Scott Pilgrim vs the World 32 bit. <br /><br />8bit does not need to be 4:3 most home computers of the era are 16:10. <br /><br />8bit bit pallets formats need a second param to specify the bit depth of the palette. So <br />8/12 if you have a 256 colour image on an Amiga<br />8/15 if you are mode 7 on a SNES<br />8/555 or 8/565 if you are on early PC adapter<br />8/24 is the &quot;new standard 8 bit palette&quot;<br /><br />There is a GDC talk where a person talks about 8bit graphics and starts at EGA (/)_. which is 16bit graphics. the comment thread is &quot;fun&quot; <img src="./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" />

Namco arcade platforms, Nintendo 64, and Neo Geo come closest to that ideal rate. But Commodore 64 pixels are exactly 3/4 of an NTSC scanline wide (hires) or 3/2 (multicolor). This means a plane of 320x200 hires pixels or 160x200 multicolor pixels has the same width as 240 scanlines and thus a display aspect ratio of 6:5.

Again, while I accept that these approaches are possible, I can't imagine that they are practical from a CPU time or hardware cost (probably more CPU than anything, especially on NTSC).<br /><br />Thing is, if the C64 had the same sprite size limitations as the NES, Mayhem probably wouldn't have scrolling background behind the status bar.  I'd just set a raster IRQ to go off just above it and reset X scroll to zero.  Seeing that Mayhem uses a VSP type scroller, I may have to store the status area in a different video bank, but that's no real inconvenience.<br /><br />The stock NES doesn't have a <em>real</em> programmable raster IRQ generator, but the SMS does.  I don't know if it can change scroll positions outside of VBLANK though.<br /><br />Anyways, all of this only addresses the status bar, of which the top half is actually made from X-expanded sprites, meaning there are still enough sprite pixels for Mayhem himself (with overly) and a couple of enemies.  Speaking of sprite pixel counts, the NES has a total of 8192 hardware sprite pixels (8x16x64) per frame, not counting the 64 pixel per line limit.  The C64 has 4032 (24x21x8), but these can easily multiplexed in software.  I've heard some games manage 24 sprites... that's 12096 pixels!  <a href="https://youtu.be/ldo2ewLBt3Y?t=42m54s" class="postlink">Here's</a> some more of them being put to use.

My favourite examples are bubble bobble in general and the long whip in castlevania. These games rely on sprite priority cycling for their design to function interactively at all. <br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">I can't imagine that they are practical from a CPU time or hardware cost</div><br />I don't think CPU time or presence of IRQ:s have too much to do with it for the mentioned trick to work. If your game pak allows for chr-paging, you're ever only one write oer frame away from animating tiles, which opens up the possibility a broad selection of features. Mass scale tile animation, parallax distortion of the playfield without need for timers, or, to a very limited extent, sprite-like appearances. Cost is not much of a problem these days, either. It perfectly feasible to use 32kB:s of external RAM for graphics, which gives you more than plenty of room for these tricks. The drawback is that you have to design your stage accordingly, ie, ideally make sure that all the letters need access to the same page of scroll-triggered animation. Else you need to dynamically update the contents of the pages, which would take some cpu time. Still, some games do update the chr table continously. Solstice, for example. So it's certainly feasible for *some* game designs.<br /><br />For clarity, i'm not arguing whether a straight port of Mayhem as-is would be possible (you have to accept drawbacks). I'm just interested in what can be done, homebrew-wise.  <br /><br />If you'd make a new game with a steady title over a scrolling background, you'd need sprites to cover all edges and 8 banks of chr-rom/ram to flip between; each with a scroll-compensated tileset for the logotype itself whereas the rest is identical across all banks. Some clever shadowing using the common background splash colour would make it easier, but it's not necessary. You don't see this in old commercial games because it was a waste of expensive storage, but these days.. <br /><br />The NES PPU not being able to multiplex its sprites is a bit of a drawback, but on the other hand, 64 is quite plenty to keep track of given the available time to update the OAM and the rest each frame. I feel the number of sprites  (quite generous at the time) were a conscious design choice in regards to that the old way of doing it (multiplexing) wasn't on the table.

It draws half the sprites in even frames and the other half in odd frames, creating a semitransparent effect. This is effective because the background is mostly dark, and it might not be quite as effective with high-contrast cartoon backgrounds like those of <em>Mayhem</em>.<br /><br />Now if horizontal sprite coverage without flicker determines what is and isn't 16-bit, Game Boy is 16-bit. It has 50% coverage with just sprites, not even counting what can be done with a &quot;window&quot; background.

I've seen that sort of effect in <em>Battletoads</em>, and I've implemented it before. In a CHR ROM game, you'd instead do like <em>MetalStorm</em>, use 4 BG + 2 OBJ switching, and devote one of the 4 background windows to parallax tiles for this effect.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">Oziphantom wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">https://youtu.be/ldo2ewLBt3Y?t=2857 Waterfall + that enemy and then there are still more enemies on the same line with mayhem and then at the end he gets invun which he could go back and visit the monster again.</div><br />Yes, that's a large enemy, and I concede it'd probably the first thing to start flickering.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">Oziphantom wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">https://youtu.be/ldo2ewLBt3Y?t=571 also sprites</div><br />You mean those spinning star-shaped coin things?
