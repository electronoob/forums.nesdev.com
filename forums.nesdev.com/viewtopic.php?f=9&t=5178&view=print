		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I've been doing experiments with a 2A03 by itself for a synthesizer, and I do not understand some of the results. This test was conducted to see what happens on startup, when the chip first gets power and a clock. The setup is very simple: D7-D0 are tied through 10k ohm resistors to ground. When the 2A03 tries to read, it will always see 0x00. If any actual data comes out of the data bus, the 10k ohm resistors are simple loads to limit the current. NMI, IRQ, and RES are all tied to VCC for a logic high. 
<br />
<br />My logic analyzer is only 8 pins, so I went with VCC, RD/WR, CLK/12, A4-A0. 
<br />
<br />When the chip first gets power, it does a counting sequence of some kind before it starts.
<br />
<br /><img src="http://www.skrasoft.com/blog/blogfiles/2A03/startup1.png" alt="Image" />
<br />
<br />Here is a close-up view
<br />
<br /><img src="http://www.skrasoft.com/blog/blogfiles/2A03/startup2.png" alt="Image" />
<br />
<br />Eventually the processor tries to actually run a program. Since it is stuck reading 0x00, it gets a reset vector of 0x00 followed by BRK instructions that keep it looping. 
<br />

<br />
<br />Here is a close-up view
<br />
<br /><img src="http://www.skrasoft.com/blog/blogfiles/2A03/startup4.png" alt="Image" />
<br />
<br />So what is the counting sequence at the beginning? It happens consistently every time, with A4 always having 8 bursts of logic toggles before the "program" starts.
<br />
<br />I would also think that with this setup, the first thing I'd see on the address pins during execution would correspond with the reset vector location at 0xFFFC and 0xFFFD. That should be 11100 and 11101 on the five probed address bus pins while RD is high, but I don't see it happen. Am I missing something obvious?
<br />
<br />Any help is appreciated <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />There are two different DMA paths in the NES: the $4014 blit-sprite-memory, which always starts reading from an address $xx00 and writes to $2004, and the DPCM which starts reading at $xyz0, x≥0xC, z={0,4,8,C} and goes for 16*w+1.
<br />
<br />Looking at the timing diagram, this looks like
<br />* read from 0, write to 4
<br />* read from 1, write to 4
<br />* read from 2, write to 4
<br />* read from 3, write to 4
<br />* read from 4, write to 4
<br />.. &amp;c. So it looks like this is the $4014 DMA.
<br />
<br />If you tie pin 30 on the 2A03 high (which the wiki states should disable the extra sound &amp;c hardware) does it stop happening?

<br />So it sounds like I should be expecting the counting sequence. I tied pin 30 high and got identical results.

<br />
<br />When and why does it need to be reset? When I first made a 2A03 synth before, I had to play around toggling VCC and RES to get it to actually work. I'd like to understand what is supposed to happen  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /> 
<br />
<br />Right now I have the reset pin tied to VCC, so each time I switch the chip on reset goes high. Do I need to hold RES low for a while after VCC turns on and then switch it high, or just toggle it low and back at some point during startup?

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I changed my system so that power switches on while RES is held low, and after a second I tie RES high. I don't get the counting pattern at all anymore. The chip now starts up like this:
<br /><img src="http://www.skrasoft.com/blog/blogfiles/2A03/startup5.png" alt="Image" />
<br />
<br />Here's a slightly closer view

<br />
<br />Here is a close up on the first address pin action
<br /><img src="http://www.skrasoft.com/blog/blogfiles/2A03/startup7.png" alt="Image" />
<br />
<br />I do see the 11100 -&gt; 11101 -&gt; 00000 address data that I was expecting, though I'm not sure what the few clock cycles before it are. 
<br />
<br />So just taking the 4 least significant bits on the address bus and starting where the bus drops to 0x0, it goes:
<br />
<br />1) Read address 0x0
<br />2) Read address 0xF
<br />3) Read address 0xE
<br />4) Read address 0xC
<br />5) Read address 0xD
<br />6) Read address 0x0
<br />7) Read address 0x1
<br />8) Write address 0xD
<br />9) Write address 0xC
<br />10) Write address 0xB
<br />11) Read address 0xE
<br />12) Read address 0xF
<br />
<br />
<br />I read somewhere that the BRK command goes to the address located in 0xFFFE and 0xFFFF. Are steps 2 and 3 above related to that?
<br />
<br />I would expect step 6 would issue a BRK command, so then I would see 0xE and 0xF come up next. Why does it instead turn to 0x1 followed by three write commands before 0xE and 0xF show up on the address bus?
<br />
<br />Thanks for all the help so far.

<br />
<br />I suspect 0x1 is it fetching the 'operand' for the BRK instruction, and the writes to 0xD,0xC,0xB are it pushing the processor status and return address onto the stack.

<br />It's a Saleae Logic. It's pretty slow (~16MHz) and only eight channels, but it can record long spans of time. It has decoders for I2C, SPI, and asynchronous serial. I think the cost was $150.
