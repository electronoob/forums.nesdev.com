You just have to split ROM files in 3 parts: header, program (PRG-ROM), tiles (CHR-ROM). Not all games have that last chunk (CHR-ROM), because they use CHR -RAM.<br /><br />There are some tools that can help you split the files (I'll let others name them, because I don't use them), but you can do it even with an hex editor. The header is always the first 16 bytes of the file, and <a href="http://wiki.nesdev.com/w/index.php/INES#.NES_format" class="postlink">certain bytes of it</a> will tell how big the next two parts (PRG and CHR) are.<br /><br />Then you just use the EPROM programmer's software to burn the PRG and CHR to 2 chips.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">Would someone also explain to me what is MMC1/3 etc and why their board is different and requires more chips?</div><br />These are mappers that expand the basic capabilities of the NES. The simpler ones simply allow the games to be larger than 32KB (the limit imposed by the system), but the most complex ones are able to expand even graphics and sound capabilities. Technically, like someone said recently, you could even put a PlayStation 3 inside a (big!) NES cart and use it as a mapper, as long as the graphics were sent to the NES in the form of 4-color tiles.<br /><br />Anyway, several different mappers were used in commercial games, and if you plan on making carts for those games you have to take that into consideration, because very few mappers are interchangeable, so you gotta know <a href="http://personales.epsg.upv.es/~jogilmo1/NES/TEXTOS/ARXIUS/BOARDTABLE.TXT" class="postlink">what game uses which mapper/board</a>. <a href="http://bootgod.dyndns.org:7777/advanced.php" class="postlink">Bootgod's site</a> is also a very good place to look mappers/boards up.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">Also would something like <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://cgi.ebay.ca/G540-USB-Universal-EPROM-FLASH-GAL-Programmer-AVR-PIC-/320512025326?cmd=ViewItem&amp;pt=LH_DefaultDomain_0&amp;hash=item4aa00162ee">http://cgi.ebay.ca/G540-USB-Universal-E ... 4aa00162ee</a><!-- m --> work for programming the NES eproms?</div>
<br />It probably will. The page says it works with 4000+ devices, and the chips used on the NES are very common standard ones, and it would be crazy if those weren't part of the 4000.

Ask for a full-resolution picture of the device to be emailed to you, and ask for a list of the devices the programmer supports. Also, remember that to erase an EPROM you will need a strong UV light. There are cheap Chinese made UV EPROM erasers on eBay which should do that easily, which is where I got mine.
<br />
<br />As for the rest, read the following:

<br />Now i'm stuck on splitting the rom, i'm using "rom splitter 1.0" from shawn crawford, it says the rom has 16k prg and 8k chr SO I assume I need to program two eproms, however the auto split errors out before I can get that far. "The rom did not split correctly (incorrect CHR Bytes?)" 
<br />It gives the same error is I use the manual split mode.
<br />I loaded a SMB1 rom and the program gives the same error, wont split correctly??? WTF?
<br />Of the dozen or so ROMs i've tried only castlevania 2 didn't error out...
<br />My other concern, my EPROMS are 12.5V, will that matter? Also the cheap chinese programmer I bought says its only for ? to 6.5V... Am I screwed there too? It listed the chips I bought as compatible with the programmer...

<br />
<br />The reference to 6.5V is probably the VCC voltage.  There actually are some 5V EPROMs that require VCC to be something higher than 5V during programming.  So if you burn (for example) an M27C512, check it in the parts lists before selecting generic 27C512.

<br />I am not very sure but perhaps the ROM file(i.e. .nes one) you are using  is a hacked/amended one.

<br />I've tried ROMs downloaded from two different sources, though I still don't know how to verify their integrity.
<br />I can't imagine the joystick.nes ROM would get any attention as far as hacking/amending???
<br />I did "play" the joystick.nes ROM with an emulator and it worked great, exactly what I need to test all the controllers I buy and sell, I play SMB for a while to try to test all the controller buttons and its such a time consumer...
<br />BTW is there a different test ROM that tests the zapper?

<br />have you been able to burn any ROM successfully so far? 
<br />
<br />I mean it does not look like a problem with the files but as you said perhaps the eprom programmer you are using works in a different manner.
