<br />thanks miker00lz, this is really helpful.
<br />
<br />one question - what does totalticks represent, is that the total number of cycles from the last executed opcode or something else?

<br />
<br />no prob, glad i could help. totalticks is simply the ongoing count of CPU clock ticks executed.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Oh thanks, for the help! I actually given up hope on this topic after I didn't get more replies after the first for a long time, and I hunkered down to try to understand sound myself. Took a darn long time, but I think my understanding of constructing my own sound buffers have gotten WAY better.
<br />
<br />I have, in fact, got a working square wave and triangle wave generator, but I've yet to actually put in things like envelope decay, duty cycle, counters, and sweep which is what I'm working on now.
<br />
<br />Right now, I'm making a program in Visual Basic .NET(Easier to make a user interface)  that plays all the sound the same way the nes does. A sound test of sorts.  Using XNA for sound.
<br />
<br />Before that, I made a program on the NES that does the exact same thing, just on the NES, of course. Made it so that I have a quick way to gauge which values in which registers make what sound AND so that I get familiar with NES programming. I might come back with the file if anyone really wants it, the only problem is that you can't quickly go through the wavelength variable and I don't feel like fixing it <img src="./images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" alt=":(" title="Sad" />
<br />
<br />I'm also making a Wave Analyzer in Visual Basic that shows how a wave looks. It's supposed to help me have a better understanding of sine waves, since I had trouble understanding.
<br />
<br />I'm sure I have a good understanding of duty cycle, but I'm not sure what's the best way to do envelope decay. All I really know is that every 240 / (decay_variable + 1) cycles I'm supposed to down some volume counter. 
<br />
<br />My idea is this:
<br />
<br />1. Find out the samples per cycle
<br />
<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">Samples_Per_Cycle = Sample_Rate / Samples<br />ex: 44100 / 735 = 60 samples per cycle</div><br /><br />2. Find out the sample period<br /><br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">Sample_Period = Sample_Rate / Wave_Frequency</div><br /><br />3. Multiply Samples_Per_Cycle by the Sample_Period to get how many samples go by before I down the counter. We'll call it Samples_Per_Envelope_Decrement<br /><br />4. Make an array that holds the decrements and declare the counter<br />In Visual Basic .NET<br /><br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">// &amp;HF = 0x0F<br />Dim envelope_decay_counter As Integer = &amp;HF<br />Dim envelope_decay&#40;&amp;HF&#41; As Single<br />For i = 0 to UBound&#40;envelop_decay&#41;<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; // Lower amplitude by 6.25%<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; envelope_decay&#40;i&#41; = i * 0.0625<br />Next i<br />&nbsp;</div><br /><br />4. In the loop that loads the sound buffer, every Samples_Per_Envelope_Decrement the envelope_decay_counter goes down by one<br /><br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">Dim amp As Single = 1.0<br />For sample_index = 0 to Samples<br />// Buncha code for preparing buffer and calculation<br />buffer&#40;sample_index&#41; = amp - envelope_decay&#40;envelope_decay_counter&#41;<br />If sample_index &gt;= Samples_Per_Envelope_Decrement<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;envelope_decay_counter -= 1<br />End If<br /><br /><br />Next sample_index<br /></div>
<br />
<br />Haven't actually done any of this yet, but that's my basic plan. I know I left out a ton of stuff in the code and some glaring flaws like what to do when envelope_decay_counter reaches zero, the negative portion of the period(-amp) but it's just a basic mock up of what I want to do. The idea is more than likely bad, but I have nothing else to go on <img src="./images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" alt=":(" title="Sad" />
<br />
<br />I'll show my actual code later today or on monday, maybe.
<br />
<br />In the meantime I'll check out miker00lz's code and try to implement envelope and duty cycle in my sound test program today.

<br />All it does right now is play the wave based on the wavelength given under the Fine/Coarse tab. Not uploading this either, unless someone really wants to see it

Also I'm about to do envelope but it hasn't actually been implemented beyond variable declaration. <br /><br />I think I need to desperately separate sine wave implementations and square wave into 2 classes derived from a wave base, but I hope it's still readable.<br /><br />Anywayz, the idea for duty cycle is that you take the sample period and divide it using the Duty Cycle value into a positve part and a negative part. Make a positive loop that goes from 0 to the amount of posive samples in the period. Then it continues from that to the sample period for negative. Seems like the wave comes out just fine for any Duty Cycle you input, but maybe someone has a better algorithm?<br /><br /><br />Duty Cycle 12.5%<br /><img src="http://i72.photobucket.com/albums/i175/Undubbed/DutyCycle_125.png" alt="Image" /><br /><br />Duty Cycle 25%<br /><img src="http://i72.photobucket.com/albums/i175/Undubbed/DutyCycle_25.png" alt="Image" /><br /><br />Duty Cycle 50%<br /><img src="http://i72.photobucket.com/albums/i175/Undubbed/DutyCycle_50.png" alt="Image" /><br /><br />Duty Cycle 25% negated<br /><img src="http://i72.photobucket.com/albums/i175/Undubbed/DutyCycle_25_negated.png" alt="Image" /><br /><br />Luckily it's just one file for the entire program (Sound Test has many irrelevant files for other waves and stuff).

<br />Hopefully all this junk I posted can give you guys a good idea on how much I know and/or don't know. Thanks for your time!

Make another topic for that if I slam into a wall.
<br />
<br />Oh and don't take my previous code too seriously, I've done some major overhauls and glaring fixes since then.

<br />Even if you don't get the length counter perfect the first time, you can still emulate music engines that use pure software envelopes.

<br />
<br />For Allegro, I use 2048 bytes (times 2 for stereo sound) as buffer. Then, you divide the number of CPU cycles per second (hardware clock) by the PC sample rate (44100).

<br />
<br /> <img src="./images/smilies/icon_evil.gif" alt=":evil:" title="Evil or Very Mad" /> 
<br />
<br />But I THINK I have an at least mostly fully functioning NES Square Wave going.
<br />
<br />Only problem is that some of the wavelength values I give produce a sound that's kind of off. That probably has to do with me using whole numbers, maybe, but it's not that big a deal. At least most of the them sound accurate. It's apparently just the high frequency ones that sound off. Like wavelength 8 sounds accurate, but 9 and A sounds off, but B sounds accurate. They don't sound too off though.
<br />
<br />However, even though I've mostly gotten the square channel working, I had to go through quite the headache to get it going and I had to do some things that I'm pretty sure the wiki or the apu_ref doesn't clearly tell you(as far as I've noticed).
<br />
<br />I have to give a big thanks to miker00lz for which I probably never would of figured out that I have to use a 16 step sequence for the duty cycle. But....why? In the wiki it says it's 8-step, but when I try 8-step the sound is quite off. When I do the 16-step that miker does, it's accurate.
<br />
<br />Secondly, the negate bit on the sweep register. The wiki and apu_ref says that it inverts the bits.... now, when it says 'invert the bits' I'm thinking that it means <strong>shifter xor 0xFFFF</strong>. How ever every time I try that it gives a sound that sound nothing like a sweep or I get an overflow exception from Visual Basic .NET(is it supposed to wrap around?). But when I looked at miker's code and saw that he just simply subtracted the shifter value(and I saw this in the NESSOUND document), I tried that and it worked! Just what does the wiki mean by 'invert the bits?'
<br />
<br />Wait...ok it seems that the 'invert the bits' idea isn't there anymore &gt;_&gt; But the one I download to take home had the line:
<br />
<br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"> If the negate flag is set, the shifted value's bits are inverted</div>
<br />
<br />Mind you I don't have the internet at home so I can't keep checking the wiki unfortunetly...
<br />
<br />
<br />Another problem that has nothing to do with the simulation or emulation, is
<br />the looping. It might just be XNA(mind you I'm using XNA with Visual Basic, which is not 'supported'), but I just cannot get the buffer to loop without some popping sound in between. Unfortunetly I still don't quite understand how streaming works. 
<br />
<br />One last thing, that isn't really a 'problem' cause it works, but I feel I'm doing it wrong. When's the proper time to reset the timer's period after a sweep? I just do it after the buffer's done getting filled and it works fine for my sound simulation, but it may or may not fly in emulation. Maybe I just missed it in the wiki.
<br />
<br />Ok, thanks everyone for helping! I'd love to think it'll be smooth sailing for implementing the triangle and noise channels, but I've learned in my experience not to hold my breath...

<br />Yeah, that seems about right.  Then you learn that there's a buttload of APU test ROMs out there that will show you just how far off your almost perfect sounding APU is from "reality".  That's when the fun begins...
