<br />
<br />English version:
<br />
<br />The NES has memory-mapped RAM available for general use from $0000 to $07FF.
<br />
<br />Zero page variables (e.g. STA $00) end up within $0000-00FF.
<br />
<br />Values pushed on the stack usually end up (depending on where you stuck the stack pointer; most people stick with page 1, e.g. $0100-01FF)) between $0100-01FF.
<br />
<br />Hope this helps.

And if you need more, you can always add 8 KiB of RAM to the cartridge, which will show up at $6000-$7FFF with  most mappers.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Yeah, seriously, when I see how much I can fit into the limited amount of memory on the NES, I can't believe how much modern games use. It seems like many games just waste so much RAM, but then again they have a lot more information to process than your typical NES game. They probably can get away with it too since so much more is available. For example, they may find it quicker to dedicate an entire byte to a status flag, rather than using each individual bit. And since they can get away with it anyways, they probably don't care. Maybe I'm wrong though; I haven't programmed for modern systems ever.

<br />Me too!  I've been bothered by this for a long time.  Why should a save file be even one megabyte, when all you should have to save is a name and a number of flags representing your position in the game and equipment?
<br />
<br />Of course games with sufficient complexity get a pass; ones where you can save full race replays or do any texture/map editing.  Though even there, it doesn't have to be exorbitant.  Never use a 16-bit int when a bitflag will do!

<br />
<br />Try to make a game using only 128 bytes of RAM on the Atari 2600, now that's a challenge! =)

<br />Because a lot of newer games turn out to have sufficient complexity. Animal Crossing 3 (4.5 MB save) has a texture editor (Able Sisters) and a map editor (pickup/drop outdoors), as well as downloadable furniture and clothes when one plays on Nintendo WFC. Super Smash Bros. Brawl (16 MB save) has the stage builder, the camera, and full fight replays.
<br />
<br />Some other games have "save anywhere", much like an emulator save state. This needs to save not only every droppable or destructible thing on the map but also the exact state of every single enemy's AI.
