It is even possible to have interrupt vectors pointing in RAM. Final Fantasy 3 does this, the NMI routine is in RAM !! Isn't that so cool ?<br />You could even point to the PPU registers, the APU registers or whatever, but the result won't be very usefull.........<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=38">Bregalad</a> — Mon May 15, 2006 10:01 am</p><hr />

It's just that I never heard of it beeing a forbiden thing. I always knew you could screw up if switching banks the vectors pointed to, but if you're carefull you can just have copies of these routines in all banks.<br /><br />Now, i'm not discussing what is more practical, usable, compact, better or any of that. The thing is that, apparently, you <strong>can</strong> set the vectors to whatever you want (even point to RAM) but you must be carefull and have code prepared at the correct locations all the time. I got confused when you said it was forbiden, as I had never heard of such a thing.<br /><br />The actual comment should be: "If you're starting to work with bankswitching, you <strong>should</strong> have all the vector point to a hardwired bank".<br /><br />'Cause you know, there are useful things you could do with the NMI in switchable banks. Maybe your game has many different types of levels, and you have different engines for each one of them. In this case, it would be useful to have different NMI routines in the ROM that you'd like to switch in according to the level.<br /><br />You can't just say "it won't play", period. That's misleading.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"><br />P.S, let me know if you have no idea what I'm talking about.<br /></div><br />Celius, I know what you're talking about, believe me.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=95">tokumaru</a> — Mon Mar 06, 2006 5:19 pm</p><hr />

I just don't do it period. I always have the reset vectors and stuff in the same bank as the vector adresses. It's safer to do it that way, in my opinion. I'm sure it will work if you don't, but if you're bankswitching, you most likely want to put it in $C000-$FFFF, because you will be able to reset at any time because you'll always have it in $C000-$FFFF. Okay, this next sentence may require you to read it multiple times, because it is long. <br /><br />If you have it in $8000-$BFFF, and you are in a bank that doesn't include your reset routine, and you do a soft reset, the vector addresses in $FFFA-$FFFF will jump to $xxxx (the reset address), but it will jump to that address in the wrong bank, so it will be a catastrophe.. Or do the banks go back to what they started as at soft reset?<br /><br />P.S, let me know if you have no idea what I'm talking about.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=138">Celius</a> — Mon Mar 06, 2006 3:41 pm</p><hr />

What you mean you can't have the vectors point to $8000-$BFFF (with the said boards)? You can't as in "it won't work, period", or you shouldn't do it when that bank is switchable?

I'm sorry, No Carrier, I didn't mean to like, offend you. And I didn't post two paragraphs of useless information. That's actually what you <strong>should</strong> do. I didn't mean to be like "I'm not going to help you, so fuck off." I tried to point you in the right direction, so you could truly <strong> understand</strong> what you are doing. And what are you trying to say when linking me to that forum? That has nothing to do with anything. I used to be like "Hey, I don't know how to do this. Show me a routine." But then I stopped doing that. I didn't understand the 6502, and that was a big mistake. So I was trying to prevent you from making that mistake. Not trying to say "Fuck off, I won't help."<br /><br />And thank you for digging up old post that was like 100 years old, and for trying to make me feel dumb in every way possible. It didn't work. Go here: <!-- w --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.freewebs.com/the_bott/gbaguy.zip">www.freewebs.com/the_bott/gbaguy.zip</a><!-- w --> . This guys site is dead, and I seem to be the only one that downloaded his tutorials, a long time ago. I admit, I should've linked you hear instead of saying "Go learn 6502 somewhere else, then you'll truly understand." He'll say in the beggining of these tutorials, "You must know the 6502 by now!" But as you read, you'll realize, he's teaching you 6502 as you go along. He uses NESASM, so you'll need that. Once these tutorials are read, you want to leave them behind in the dust. They are fairly inaccurate in many aspects, but they really boosted me into the world of NESdev.<br /><br />EDIT: Oh, these tutorials are on my site, but the guy that made these tutorials, his site is dead.<br /><br />Celius wrote:<br />This isn't an emulation question, but I ask it here, because people only seem to be active here.

Hey, No Carrier, you should really listen to lynxsolaris. He got started in NES development not long ago and he is progressing rather nicely, so he might have some interesting tips to pass along to you. I've been helping him out a bit with the basics of setting up a game and he's doing pretty well.<br /><br />About Nbasic, you're right, just drop it. When you know 6502 assembly you're in control of everything, you gotta have that or you'll won't get far.<br /><br />Don't shoot me yet, but if you don't know 6502 ASM yet, you should <strong>really</strong> play with it a bit, away from the NES for a while. You can't control a machine if don't speak it's language. It's like if you have a fully qualified maid at home but you don't know how to give her the simple command "dust the furniture". Grab a copy of <a href="http://home.pacbell.net/michal_k/6502.html" class="postlink">Michal Kowalski's 6502 simulator</a> and analyse how the flags work, do some simple additions and subtractions, try a few conditional branches and stuff. You can run the code command by command and watch how they affect the flags, the memory and the stack, wich really helps in understanding what each command actually does, something you can't learn just from reading. You just can't.<br /><br />I say that because that's how I started. I read thousands of 6502 docs and never got to understand the stack, flags and branches (things not present in higher level languages I was used to) until I played with the simulator. Then, before moving to the NES, I developed a series of small routines in 6502 ASM so that I could think just as the processor works, and then code would flow easily from my head, wich it does now. I made multiplication and division routines and things like that. I can't tell how valuable that was for me.<br /><br />I really do not think it is healthy that you just get access to ready-made code that draws to the background and has a sprite move around so that you adapt it to your needs without actually knowing what's going on exactly, 'cause that only produces "nesticle code", wich is what you're already getting with Nbasic.<br /><br />I could give you a list of things that would be involved in getting what you want working, explaining why each step is necessary. Then you can try to understand it, in order, and get back to me/us when you have doubts on a specific step.<br /><br /><strong>1.</strong> The fisrt thing to do is turn rendering off (bit 3 and bit 4 of $2001 set to 0) so that you can work with the PPU freely whithout worring about writing to it at the correct time. When rendering is off, you can write to it at ANY time.<br /><br /><strong>2.</strong> Then you need to wait 2 or so VBlanks to go by, because the PPU needs some time before it is ready to be used.<br /><br /><strong>3.</strong> Now you can just draw all the tiles you want to the screen. You'll want to start with name table 0, wich is at PPU address $2000 (not the register, this is the PPU addressing space). You write the address you want to write to (in this case $2000) to register $2006 one byte at a time (first $20 and then $00). Then you write the codes of the tiles you want in the screen to register $2007, one tile at a time, until the whole screen is filled with tiles.<br /><br /><strong>4.</strong> After the BG is ready, you have to set the initial position of your sprite. It is recommended that you don't use registers $2003/$2004 to handle sprites, but reserve a page (256 butes) in RAM to write your sprite definitions and move them to OAM by a DMA transfer at a later time. So, clear this whole page you choose to use with the value $FF (or any othe value that will keep the sprites you're not using off the screen), but set the first sprite (or any othe you fell like) with the information needed to display it in the middle of the screen, for example. Do the DMA transfer to put your sprite(s) in place (write the number of the page you used for sprite definitions to register $4014). You'll also probably want to write your palette now.<br /><br /><strong>5.</strong> Now we're almost set to turn our screen on, but you'll won't want to do it without knowing it is the correct time to do so. If you just turn it on without any worries, you may end up doing so when the light cannon of the TV is in the middle of the screen, wich will result in a partially displayed screen, and, although it happens really really fast, it's still a glitch. So you wait for VBlank.<br /><br /><strong>6.</strong> Now, we're inside VBlank, and you should do the last few arrangements so that your screen is displayed properly. Set $2000 and $2001 accordingly to what your intention are (indicate what side of the patterna table you're using for sprites and BG, set the name table to display to the name table you drew the BG to, that kind of thing). Rendering can be turned on already too, it's safe to do it inside the VBlank. You'll want to turn NMI's on here to, as you'll be rading the joypad every frame and updating the sprite's position. You'll also need to set the scroll values to 0 (write $00 to 2005 twice), to make sure the screen will be static at the correct position.<br /><br /><strong>7.</strong> Since all the set up is over, and you enambled NMI's, all the rest will be responsability of the NMI routine. Your main code can just enter into an infinite loop now.<br /><br /><strong>8.</strong> Now onto the NMI, wich will take care of all the rest. The NMI starts when each VBlank does. So all the writing to the PPu has to be handled first. All the writing you'll be doing is update the sprite's position, so you can just do a sprite DMA as the first thing in the NMI.<br /><br /><strong>9.</strong> The next thing to do in the NMI (well, all the rest is NMI so I'll just stop saying it ok?) after all the PPU writing is finished is to set the scroll register back to place ($00 twice). This has to be done every frame to make sure your screen will never "jump", and will always stay pretty and still.<br /><br /><strong>10.</strong> Onto the "game" logic now. You have to read the joypad now. And react to the 4 different directions that can be pressed. If the player pressed UP, decrement the Y coordinate of your sprite (wich is in that page you chose before, remember?). If the player pressed DOWN you'll increment Y. If he pressed LEFT you'll decrement the X position and if he pressed RIGHT you'll increment X. Of course the sprite will wrap from the edges of the screen to the opposite edge, but that's ok for a simple demo. Now you've done all the logic, just exit the NMI (RTI command).<br /><br />That's about it. Since you changed the coordinates of the sprite it will be drawn at the new position in the next NMI. I may have left some details off (although that was a huge ass post!), I'm not perfect, but we'll check that along the way, ok?<br /><br />Good luck.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=95">tokumaru</a> — Sun Mar 05, 2006 12:50 pm</p><hr />

<div class="quotetitle">No Carrier wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"><br />Thanks lynxsolaris. However, I am looking for 6502! I've been through the Nbasic stuff, and I wanted to see how real 6502 compares to the ASM that Nbasic creates and compiles - because my Nbasic programs DO NOT work in any quality emulators.<br /><br />I enjoyed reading some of the PDF files that Bob Rost posted, they explain some NES soft/hardware in an easy to understand way.<br /><br />I won't be messing with Nbasic anymore, but it did help me understand a few things about graphics and tiles, etc.<br /><br />NC<br /></div><br /><br />Sorry about that.  Have you had a look at NES 101 <a href="http://nesdev.com/NES101.zip" class="postlink">http://nesdev.com/NES101.zip</a><br /><br />It's one of the first assembly code projects that got me started (with sprites anyway).<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=284">lynxsolaris</a> — Sun Mar 05, 2006 8:15 am</p><hr />
