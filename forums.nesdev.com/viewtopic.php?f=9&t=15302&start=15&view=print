Assuming that this pirate clone bothered to copy that part... If it doesn't work, we could still add external parts to read any latched state instead.

Lidnariq could probably tell you which combination(s) would be the most useful. It may also help if you could invert the signals on PAL pin 2 and/or pin 3.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">Fisher wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">But I sure can socket a PRG ROM on the cartridge board and do any tests needed.</div><br />I won't be writing test ROMs any time soon.

Pulling it low or high won't tell us anything useful.<br /><br />The PAL uses pin 1 to detect when the values on pins 2 through 7 are valid. On the NES, /ROMSEL is only low when the other signals are valid. On your motherboard, A0 makes no such guarantee, but hopefully /OE or /CE will.

Is it correct?<br /></div>That's the easiest thing I can think of that should produce useful results.<br /><br />I'm only confident that that will provide the information necessary to figure out whether $8008 and $800C do anything. Hopefully it'll demonstrate what's going on with $C008 and $C00C too, but I'm not certain about that yet.<br /><br />Unrelatedly, I was looking more closely at the PAL16L8 datasheet, and noticed that pins 19 and 12 are <em>always</em> outputs, and can <em>never</em> be used as feedback terms inside. So they have to exclusively be a function of the other pins, which makes them really convenient for logic function reduction.<br /><br />Apparently:<br />  Pin 19 (counter clear) is 1 iff Pin 8 (Cnt=86) is 1 OR pin 16 is 0<br />  Pin 12 (CIRAMA10) is: if Pin 17 ($9004q1 is 1) then Pin 18 ($9004q0) else Pin 7 (VRC2Mirroring)<br />And it turns out two more pins don't involve any feedback loops ... but we already knew these:<br />  Pin 13 is 1<br />  Pin 15 is 1 iff A2 is 0, or A14 is 0, or R/W is 1, or /ROMSEL is 1 → detects writes to $F004 and $F00C<br /><br />The other four pins (pin 14 /IRQ, pin 17 $8004q0, pin 18 $8004q1, pin16) involve feedback loops, how inconvenient. <br /><br />Pin 16 is definitely always 1 during writes to $C008. It is definitely always 0 during writes to $C00C .. but interestingly, it looks like it doesn't care about /ROMSEL?<br /><br />If I look at the combination of pins 14, 15, 16, and 19, only eight of the sixteen possibilities ever exist, the following never occur:<br />Pins 19(CLR) and 16 both clear (duh, per above)<br />Pins 14(/IRQ) and 15 both clear (hmm)<br />all four pins high (hmm?)<br /><br />I'll think about this some more and see if anything comes to mind re: pin 14 and 16.
