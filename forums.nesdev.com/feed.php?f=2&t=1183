Two separable game engine on the same cartridge ? That's pretty odd. Additionally, Nintendo would prefer having more people buying the new GBC than have people stuck with their old game boys. I foud that kinda strange. Now, the GBA plays the older games as if they were played on a GBC, regardless of the cartridge itself.<br />The windows is a separate layer for text windows that cannot be scrolled, right ? That's a really good feature.

If you have two interdependent data tables, such as compressed data and the decompression dictionary, that might be easier with two independent 8 KB banks unless you want to repeat the dictionary in each bank that has data or you want to put the dictionary in the fixed bank. Example of such would be a map (compressed data) and the metatile table (dictionary).<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=9">tepples</a> — Fri Mar 03, 2006 1:34 pm</p><hr />

Effectively, DPCM samples can only be played from $c000-$ffff, so a MMC3 is needed to bankswitch them. However, I was asking in general, without using DPCM bankswitching.<br />Has two 8kb banks in $8000-$bfff any advantage on a single 16kb bank ? It effectively makes you able to have two different bankswitchable data appart of the 16kb hardwired data at $c000-$ffff. But has this any significant advantage ?<br />And is 32kb bankswitching good in any way other than simplify cartridge logic ?<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=38">Bregalad</a> — Fri Mar 03, 2006 10:03 am</p><hr />

If you're going to use DPCM extensively, then you'll need part of $C000-$FFFF switchable. Generally, though, you'll also want the upper PRG block to be fixed to the last bank to simplify dealing with interrupts.<br /><br />The MMC3 happens to have a very convenient setup, where you have one switchable bank at $A000-$BFFF and an additional switchable bank which you can place at either $8000-$9FFF (to effectively give you a 16KB switchable bank at $8000-$BFFF) <strong>or</strong> at $C000-$DFFF (to allow the DPCM space to be banked). It's no wonder that the MMC3 was one of the most popular mappers used in USA games - it was reasonably simple (a 44-pin chip) but exceptionally versatile as well.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=7">Quietust</a> — Fri Mar 03, 2006 9:58 am</p><hr />
