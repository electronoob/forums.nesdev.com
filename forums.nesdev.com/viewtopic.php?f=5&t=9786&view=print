		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />1) Annoyances to define joypad buttons.<br /><br />Seriously, for an emulator to be functional, you should be able to change the button mapping very easily. You should be able to assign only one key to one button if you want to (some emus forces you to assign multiple keys to one button, which is pointless), and you should be able to assign multiple buttons to the same key, if you want them to be pressed simultaneously.<br /><br />You should be able to change the mapping of just one button without changing the other keys - it is annoying when they force you to re-define ALL buttons every time<br /><br />2) No debugging features<br /><br />I want to see how my games work internally. I can understand they don't release ALL debugging features, but it's horrible that more than half of the emus around have ZERO debugging features. No VRAM viewer, no Palette viewer, no debugger, etc.. This is so annoying. Especially considering they probably HAD to implement them for the development of the emulator (unless they could make it work at the first try - which is very unlikely). Then why would they REMOVE features when they do the official release ?<br /><br />3) New version has less features than old version / is not compatible with old save states<br />This is especially SNES9x which comes in mind. An emu should be able to load save states from self older versions. It should also be able to load save states of other popular emus ideally.<br />Features should be either kept or added but NEVER removed. In the new SNES9x you can't turn off HDMA or window clipping any longer. Why, why ? All they risk is that we could see how the game works internally, but they don't want that. Fuck.<br /><br />4) Saves in their own folder instead of ROM folder<br />Unfortunately this stupid trend is increasing at such a point it is rare to find an emu which uses saves in the ROM folder. Because of course, all emus assume they are so awesome that, you will never play something with another emu, and that of course you don't want your save transferred automatically with all your emus without doing anything. No, you must manually copy the .sav file from each emu's folder manually every time you want to use another emu. If you back-up your ROMs, then you don't back-up your saves as well. If you delete your ROM because you don't want it any longer, ghost saves will still be present in your emu's folder.<br /><br />Seriously this is the worst of all. I really want to punch the first guy who had the idea to store saves in a separate folder for the first time. What an idiot.<br /><br />5) Not regularly overwriting the SAVE file.<br />Because of course, your emu does never crash, so it will safely write the SRAM from your PC's RAM to hard drive when you close the program normally, right ? WRONG ! You can loose saves because of emulator crashes even though you saved your game.<br />Thank god not all emus fall in this category, but SNESGT has been causing me many problems with this one.<br /><br />6) Don't play the ROM automatically / Can't drag and drop / Can't associate with the file extension<br />I can understand the later 2 because of technical laziness when writing the emulator, but a good emu should be able to play a ROM just by double clicking on it, and it should be able to open it if you drag-and-drop it into the emu's window.<br /><br />Emus which needs to manually hit a &quot;Run&quot; or &quot;Turn on system&quot; button are annoying. Sure it is more accurate, but usually the fact to load a ROM means you turn on the system too, right ? If they go that route to be more accurate then they should at least emulate the snow on the screen before you turn on the system, and allow you to turn on the system without a cartridge. But of course they don't !

Only 8 keypresses.<br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">2) No debugging features<br /></div><br />Totally agree with you here, I liked how Snemul would let you see graphics and palettes, even when its emulation wasn't up to the standards of Zsnes or Snes9x.  For Sega Master System/Gamegear, I like to use Emukon, because it lets you see the graphics.<br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">3) New version has less features than old version / is not compatible with old save states<br /></div><br />This is really hard to pull off.  Sometimes you rewrite such a big chunk of the emulator, and you need to quickly implement savestates for the new features, so you just dump the variables and throw it in a file.  But then your new version doesn't have things organized the same way, so the new version's savestates become incompatible.  So if you need backwards compatibility, you end up with 50 different versions of the loadstate function.  That can get yucky really quick.<br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">4) Saves in their own folder instead of ROM folder<br /></div><br />If you put your Roms on a CD, or on a read-only network share, you will need a separate folder.  I guess this is part of the old-style vs new-style divide here, old style is that you threw files on the C:\ drive, and made directories, and threw everything together.  New style is to use the Document and Settings tree, possibly even *gasp* the Application Data folder.  And nobody agrees whether to save things in My Documents, or Application Data, or wherever.<br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">5) Not regularly overwriting the SAVE file.<br /></div><br />I remember when ZSNES added to the &quot;SRAM Check and Save&quot; feature, and that was a big deal.<br />But you can't blindly save the SRAM every time there's a write there, some games (Super Mario land 2) even use the save ram as the system stack.  I guess periodic checking and saving is the way to go here.<br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">6) Don't play the ROM automatically / Can't drag and drop / Can't associate with the file extension<br /></div><br />Yeah, Nintendulator dropped the ball here.  Also NO$GBA makes you start the game manually.  But there are situations where you want to get your debugger ready before any code executes.

This is always a sore point when using a new emulator. You'd have loved QuickNES for Mac. Configure keys, it shows a box with rectangles at each button locations that show the current key for the button. You can either click on a button you want to set, then press that button.

This is an atomic operation, where any failure along the way either leaves the old intact file, or the new one, never a corrupt file.<br /><br />7) No Recently Played menu.<br /><br />The emulator should keep track of the most recent few games I've played, so that if I'm playing them regularly, I can just open the emulator and select them from the menu. And it should reload the last save file for that game as well.

At the same time, I can see why this is the case. Most people develop NES emulators as a hobby, not as a job, so they'll work on whatever part of the emulator that they find the most interesting. Debugging features and the sometimes-complex GUI programming that can come with it probably won't place very high on any &quot;Fun things to do in emulation&quot; list. Sure, a palette viewer is usually trivial to do, but something like a decent disassembler with stepping, breakpoints and watches is not.<br />I'd also guess that most emulators are geared towards gaming rather than homebrew development, which probably contributes to emulator authors' lack of interest in adding debugging features (combined with the fact that there's so much information available about systems like the NES that the emulator authors themselves typically can get along just fine by just adding some prints here and there in many cases).

Even if you don't develop much for a system its incredibly fun, and interesting, to see how your favourite (or less favourite) games works internally.<br /><br />I spend hours watching the nametables and pattern tables of NES games being updated during game-play, and I actually find this just as fun as playing.<br /><br />Also I don't ask them to add debugging features (even if this would be the best), just not to remove them, as it's likely impossible to develop an emulator without any debugging features, how can you trace your emulation bugs then ?<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">Because the change results in something visible to the emulated program.</div><br />And that's what makes it interesting.

Old versions of SNES9x could load ZST savestates, and I'm sure there was an NES emulator that was compatible with NESTicle save states.
