		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />The generic level editor I envision would be more like generic for a given genre. The output format would be an easily parsable, human-readable format that you would then process into whatever format you want. Tiled gets the job done pretty well, just takes a bit more supporting scripts and a bit less tool integration.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Any editor that can only handle one type of encoding for levels, no matter how versatile it is, will fail to gather interest. The NES is a pretty limited platform, so most of the time the data in the games is very customized, so that each game can get the best out of ROM/RAM/CPU. On the other hand, an editor generic enough to handle all possible cases (grid-based vs. object-based, different metatile sizes, metatiles inside metatiles, etc.) would be insanely difficult to code, and would probably still fail to meet everyone's needs.<br /><br />After some thinking, I decided that the most realistic solution would be an editor with a grid system and an object system, that outputs 2D arrays for grids and attribute lists for objects. The different formats would be handled exclusively by scripts (basic/common ones can come with the program, but everyone is free to write their own). Some features could be present in the editor to aid in the creation of compression-friendly maps, such as the ability to copy/paste variable-sized blocks (optionally aligned to a grid) or the option to automatically alter other regions of the map that look the same as the one inside the grid you're editing.<br /><br />Building levels out of objects will be hard because the attributes of the objects need to affect how they look (e.g. how long a platform is), and even though it's easy for the editor to store custom parameters (e.g. an enemy's strength), it's pretty much impossible to customize how these parameters will affect the visual representation of the object. In this case, to store maps similarly to how SMB does it, I believe it would be better to draw them using a grid and have the script look for ways to compress them using objects. The script would be pretty complex compared to typical grid-based map compression, though.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Why not make a very easy scripting tool to parse the raw level data into a useable format for your game files? Or, just have it very easily doable in C, AKA not using C++ crap and making sure your code is heavily objectified and uses very few globals that it needs.<br /><br />Plus, getting around the enemy encoding, you can have two planes. One a tile plane, one an object plane. They're need to be parsed in to one which'd be difficult, but you only have to write the tool once.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />My own ideas for a general purpose level editor is one that doesn't use a limited format. It would have sufficient features (tiles, sprites, and other things), and then have a script to extend it and to make the format. (It can then be used for things other than NES/Famicom too, although it may have some features which are specific to NES/Famicom such as the pattern tables, name tables, sprites, etc. It could even output the proper assembly language codes, whether it is MagicKit, ASM6, etc.)<br /><br />I might make such a thing in future; I have some ideas how to do so! (If someone else want to make, you can do too, of course; we can see who prefer what. I would probably do it with C, SDL, SQLite, and MagicKit, and it would use some vi-like commands and mouse-chording; but someone else might prefer something entirely different.)

In some cases this can be problematic, for example if certain palette entries have special meanings (the solution to the mapping problem isn't unambiguous).<br /><br />Yet another way, probably simpler for a completely new game, would be to add the wanted attribute in the Tile Properties (each tile can have as many individual properties (strings) as is needed). This will of course only allow one to specify the attributes on a per-tile basis, not for each individual metatile in a map. One way to get around this is what tokumaru mentioned, other is to have a separate background layer with 4 specially colored tiles, the tile index can then be used as the attribute data when doing the conversion from TMX (the Tiled file format) to custom format. It's not quite as visual in the editor as tokumaru's method though (the view is not what you'll get in the actual game).
