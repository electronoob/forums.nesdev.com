<br />I am after a devcart that doesn't need chip swapping for each build, but for MMC1.  Well, I would love to switch to MMC3, but retrousb doesn't sell MMC3 carts for fabrication.  (Someone once mentioned that the required number of gates in a PLC for MMC3 exceeded what was cost-effective or something).

<br />Which is why someone else recommended making a reduced MMC3 with less support for CHR bankswitching (e.g. don't implement CHR bank registers 0-4) so that it could fit in commonly available 5.0 V CPLDs. That led to <a href="http://nesdev.com/bbs/viewtopic.php?p=51785#51785" class="postlink">this</a> and <a href="http://nesdev.com/bbs/viewtopic.php?p=65606#65606" class="postlink">this</a>.

<br />I would prefer to not dissemble my NES and extract the CPU.
<br />
<br />I've read the threads about alternate mappers that Tepples point out.  I'm all for a new mapper.  I don't need a strictly conforming MMC1, MMC3 or FME7.
<br />
<br />One thing that I don't like about MMC1 is that there is only one switchable ROM bank.  I like the idea of having a small switchable ROM bank for holding music samples.  Something that the NMI handler can have free reign over without clobbering what the main thread is doing.
<br />
<br />I'd like to animate background tiles and sprites (for water / shoreline effects like in Crystalis (MMC3 btw)).  Since right now I'm restricting myself to MMC1, I've opted to use non-switching CHR-RAM.  So I can animate very few tiles at a time, but its workable.
<br />
<br />I want to have 8-way background scrolling.  I'm willing to live with scroll artifacts on the edges if I must, but like most people, would prefer to avoid them.
<br />
<br />I need a ~2 row status bar.  I've put mine at the top and use sprite-0 hits to switch nametables.  I'm ok with this, but if there is a better way (like, say, an IRQ), then I'd like that instead.  Waiting for sprite-0 wastes a lot of CPU cycles.
<br />
<br />I want the 8K of RAM from $6000-$7fff.  Atleast 1K battery backed.  
<br />
<br />Heck, if the 8K of RAM could be bankable too then that would be awesome.  I could do some really interesting things with deformable terrain if I had more RAM.
<br />
<br />ps- Tepples / Memblers, How would your theoretical mapper detect that the PPU is trying to render tile $FF?  What is it looking for at the wire level?

<br />In much the same way that MMC2 and MMC4 detect drawing tiles $FD and $FE. It'd use CHR /A12 AND A11 AND A10 AND A9 AND A8 AND A7 AND A6 AND A5 AND A4 to pull IRQ low, and a write to an acknowledge register to put it back high. But it's not as necessary now that the DPCM Split technique is known.
<br />
<br />I smell split as soon as I know what to call the new topic.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I like CopyNES, but frankly the software sucks if you use it exclusively for quick tests for development (while being great for dumping carts, mapper testing, even emulating and single-stepping through the code, on the NES CPU itself).  What I've hoped to see is a command-line app that will upload (user specifies the plugin and ROM file), then enter play mode.  I noticed people were supporting CopyNES in linux, it would be nice if that sort of functionality ever showed up in an app such as ucon64.  I haven't been following it much though.
<br />
<br />The 2nd thread tepples linked to is my idea for a flash cart, I think it's better than MMC1.  There is no IRQ, 2 16kB PRG pages, 2 2kB CHR pages (other 2kB halves are fixed), h/v/1 mirroring select register, optional 32kB WRAM.  Logic fits in a 36-macrocell CPLD.  The hope is to make it cheap enough to use it for releasing games.  And as a cheap flashcart, why not buy several, and share your games/demos/music with friends, heheh.   CopyNES could program it even if it was 100% erased.   The expansion port adapter I'm working on (with some great help from Xious) and virtually any adapter, could program it using the bootloader discussed in this thread.  The Verilog is ready, I need to do a good board layout for it, but I've sorta jumped onto getting this expansion device working because it'll make it a lot more interesting.
<br />
<br />The expansion port adapter could support IRQ (and I believe NMI, as well!).  Obviously that's only any use if you have the expansion hardware though.  But I'm hoping the sound capabilities, file saving/loading, and other features will make it pretty interesting.

<br />The DPCM split is far from ideal. As far as I can tell your method is not scanline-oriented, which means that the split can't be dynamically moved up and down at runtime (meaning it can't be used for skipping the status bar à la Crystalis, for example). And my method, which is scanline-oriented, uses too much CPU time (up to 20% of the 240 visible scanlines for <strong>each</strong> split). I'm trying to cut that time down, but have failed so far.
<br />
<br />Also, I have nothing against giving up the DPCM channel, but I'm sure a lot of people plan to keep using it.

<br />That would be great! I'm really looking forward to that! I really liked the cable idea, but being limited to the MMC1 was a big let down for me.

<br />
<br />Crystalis has scrolling glitches on the extreme left and right when scrolling left and right.  This is more noticeable when in the caves.  For example, in the cave leading to the statues of the moon and sun, you go down, then turn left.  As you walk left notice the tiles on the right of the screen. (from memory, I don't have this game right in front of me right now).
<br />
<br />I don't want to use sprites for my status bar, like in Contra or Metroid.  I need the sprites for ... more spritish things...

<br />There are a couple of tricks to completely avoid scrolling glitches that do not require mapper IRQs. In my game for example I decided to disable rendering for the first 16 scanlines, which not only hides the glitches but also gives me more time for VRAM updates. In a custom cart the best option would be 4-screen mirroring, of course. A status bar really complicates things though.

<br />I've got the first version of this working. It's a command line tool to transfer an iNES ROM to NES. It's not very useful for development yet, however, because it always transfers the full ROM, and with mapper data alone taking &gt;40KB it's not fast enough for that. Next I'll start working on only transfering the differences in PRG and CHR and not re-uploading the mapper each time, but that'll require some work on the mappers first.
<br />
<br />Anybody out there who could test it? PowerPak and PC-&gt;NES cable is required.
