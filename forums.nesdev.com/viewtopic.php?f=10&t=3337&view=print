<br />it would be a waste for performance..  for most side scrollers, you don't even need the extra pixels...  
<br />
<br />if it's a map screen, like in zelda, then those extra pixels could help...

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Since the method used by the NES to display a progressive (non-interlaced) signal is probably not standard, some video devices always display the signal interlaced. Examples include new-fangled high-definition TVs and PC video capture cards. A NES connected to one of these could be made to display an interlaced image if the user helped the NES determine which was the even field. To do the actual image display, you'd most likely switch between two different sets of tiles, one for even lines and the other for odd lines. This is simple if you are using banked CHR ROM (MMC3 etc.).

<br />If field B contains the same lines as field A, all that would do is reduce the frame rate by half and shimmer the screen in an annoying way. As people have pointed out, you need twice the memory to achieve twice the lines!

<br />i know that, but you can also switch between lines..  each frame, it could alternate between "virtual fields" (for a lack of a better term)..
<br />
<br />I've done that on a Sega 32X, which doesn't even support interlacing, and it worked..  it's ehh, hard to describe, but the person above you did it better than i said it..

<br />i said i was done hoaxing..  let me explain how the 32X works...
<br />
<br />The 32X is not capable of generating it's own sync.  It uses the Genesis video sync signals (and it's RGB lines too)...  With that in mind, you can trigger the Genesis VDP to do interlaced mode (either one of the two, won't matter here), and on the 32X, have it "flicker" between virtual fields..  For example, if you forced a 480i display into 240p, it would look funky, like each frame is alternating..  do this on the 32X frame buffer and your set, as the Genesis is doing the interlacing for the 32X..
<br />
<br />This was never done on games, and not recommended by Sega, because the 32X could lose a frame, then the fields became backwards..  (odd to even, and even to odd)
