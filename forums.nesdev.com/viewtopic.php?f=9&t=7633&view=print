		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />All of the PPU rendering information I've been looking over lately has got me interested in scanline counting.
<br />
<br />However, the currently-available information regarding the MMC3 IRQ counter seems to conflict with how the PPU works.
<br />
<br />First and foremost, Brad Taylor's doc states that the following fetches occur:
<br />2 Nametable fetches (2xxx)
<br />2 tile fetches (two parts of one tile) (0xxx or 1xxx)
<br />-- 32 times
<br />
<br />2 Discarded Nametable fetches (2xxx)
<br />2 Tile fetches (two parts of one tile) (1xxx or 0xxx)
<br />-- 8 times
<br />
<br />2 Nametable fetches (2xxx)
<br />2 tile fetches (two parts of one tile) (0xxx or 1xxx)
<br />-- 2 times
<br />
<br />2 Nametable fetches (2xxx)
<br />
<br />Supposedly, the MMC3 watches A12 (not A13 like Taylor's doc says), but this is confusing, because A12 determines the difference between 0xxx-1xxx, and 2xxx-3xxx.
<br />Given the above data about fetches, A12 will rise 8 times per scanline if sprites use CHR $1000, 34 times if BG uses CHR $1000, and 42 times if both use CHR $1000.
<br />
<br />However, each rising edge of A12 supposedly decrements the MMC3's scanline counter, so something isn't right here.
<br />
<br />Where am I making the mistake?

<br />Maybe it uses a different method of ignoring the successive writes... counter maybe. I don't think anybody really knows.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I dunno, I'm looking over this backwards and forewards, and it seems the common way to explain how the counter works is that it just monitors A12, and uses some kind of filter to eliminate the quick toggling of A12 when it goes between fetching a tile bitmap at $1xxx and fetching a nametable byte at $2xxx over and over (which toggles A12 quickly).
<br />
<br />However, the explanation always breaks down when you have to consider the fact that the counter clocks twice per scanline when both sprites and bg use tiles at $1xxx. This is the part where I get stuck when I try to wrap my head around it; there's no gap between when the tiles finish rendering and the sprite fetches begin; A12 would just keep toggling the same way the whole way through, which would mean the scanline counter would only ever see one rise, and effectively be halted, like what happens when the BG and Sprite tiles are both fetched from $0xxx.
<br />
<br />Either there's some kind of undocumented thing going on with the PPU fetches (like, maybe there <em>is</em> a gap), or there's more to the counter than just watching A12.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Drag, are you testing this in an emulator or on hardware? If on hardware are you using the PowerPak or a donor cart? If a donor cart, which one?
<br />
<br />I have been studying the MMC3 a lot recently (because I am trying to implement in in a CPLD, wish me luck <img src="./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" /> ). Here are some of the finer points that have an impact on your observations:
<br />
<br /><ul>1. Games using MMC3 are only supposed to use $0XXX for background and $1XXX for sprites. As far as I can tell this is the only configuration supported by the official MMC3.<br />2. MMC3 boards use a 220pF capacitor to ground to provide a low-pass filter for the A12 line. This means that when the PPU toggles A12 rappidly the MMC3 only sees a single rising edge.<br />3. The MMC3 implementation on the PowerPak is known to have issues with it's implementation of the IRQ counter. This is likely due to the lack of an external low-pass filter for A12.<br />4. Emulators seem to be based on Blargg's behavioral description of the MMC3, which states that if BG is used at $1XXX and sprites at $0XXX that the IRQ counter is clocked during the scanline, and if the other way around it is clocked at the pre-render scanline (during sprite fetch).<br /></ul>
<br />
<br />I think the above should clear up your confusion about MMC3 opperation. As for using $1xxx as BG and sprites, this is 100% not supported by the MMC3 hardware. Chances are if you run this in an emulator (see point 4) the emulator will think both cases are true and clock the IRQ counter twice, once during the scanline and once again during the pre-scanline sprite fetch.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Is it really a low-pass filter on PA12 with a period longer than one fetch, or is it just to deglitch the signal? I ask because PA12 is one of the inputs to the bankswitching function (the others being PA11 and PA10). So wouldn't a low-pass filter on PA12 also affect bankswitching? At this point, I'd propose a decap and photomicrograph of the MMC3 IC so that we can see exactly what's going on inside that chip.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Good point. Now that I look at the math on that the break frequency of that low-pass is in the hundreds of Mhz. That would be fine if the MMC3 was used as intended (with BG at $0xxx and Sprites at $1xxx), but it would not explain Blargg's observations. Perhaps the clock signal to the counter is significantly slower than the PPU clock.

<br />
<br />Yeah that capacitor seems to just be for deglitching.  If it truly did filter A12, then nothing would work right, since the signal was slowed down too much.
<br />
<br />On my FPGA NES, I have a counter that acts as the low pass filter.  It ignores multiple pulses of A12 using the counter.  It's possible that the counter has a period of 1/2 scanline on a real MMC3.
<br />
<br />This way, if A12 is held high most of the time, it could fire twice?
<br />
<br />There is another thing too that might've been forgotten about.
<br />
<br />When the PPU is fetching nametables, A12 is low.  So it's alternating between fetching nametable/attrib table data and character data so A12 will keep toggling in this case.  
<br />
<br />In my FPGA case, I got 100% compatibility (at least all the mmc3 games in goodnes and all the derivatives that use it such as multicarts and things) by filtering using the counter approach.
<br />
<br />It might be useful to hook an MMC3 up "bare" and watch what happens when A12 is toggled at different rates.   BTW I suspect it'd use M2 clocks for the counter if I had to guess.
<br />
<br />If you get something that seems to work, I suggest the following games for testing:
<br />
<br />* SMB3 (pretty bog-standard, but sometimes the status bar will jump a scanline or two)
<br />
<br />* Megaman 4 (apparently they write to the registers "out of order" and older emulators failed in a few places.
<br />
<br />* Klax (japanese version only!  US version is RAMBO-1) both games heavily abuse the IRQ counter, making it fire every 4 or 8 scanlines.  This is done to get more attribute entries effectively for the blocks at the bottom of the screen.
<br />
<br />* one of the SMB3 total conversions/hacks.  I can't quite remember the name of it, but this game SHOULD fail on a proper MMC3 emulation, because they didn't select the proper bank for the tiles or sprites.  This causes interrupts to occur way too early from what I recall.  Not sure now what the name of it was.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Ok, if the scanline counter reacts to just simple $2006 writes, I have an idea.
<br />
<br />Leave PPU rendering off, and just manually manipulate the PPU A lines through writes to $2006, to simulate what the PPU does during a scanline.
<br />
<br />First, set the IRQ counter to 02, and then do the following:
<br />$2006 &lt;- 2000 ;Tile 1 = 00
<br />$2006 &lt;- 23C0
<br />$2006 &lt;- 0000
<br />$2006 &lt;- 0008
<br />
<br />$2006 &lt;- 2001 ;Tile 2 = 01
<br />$2006 &lt;- 23C0
<br />$2006 &lt;- 0010
<br />$2006 &lt;- 0018
<br />
<br />$2006 &lt;- 2002 ;Tile 3 = 00
<br />$2006 &lt;- 23C1
<br />$2006 &lt;- 0000
<br />$2006 &lt;- 0008
<br />
<br />$2006 &lt;- 2003 ;Tile 4 = 01
<br />$2006 &lt;- 23C1
<br />$2006 &lt;- 0010
<br />$2006 &lt;- 0018
<br />
<br />...and so on, until you "fetch" 32 tiles. Then "fetch" 8 sprite tiles:
<br />
<br />$2006 &lt;- 2000
<br />$2006 &lt;- 23C0
<br />$2006 &lt;- 1000 ;Fetch tile 00 for "sprite 0"
<br />$2006 &lt;- 1008
<br />
<br />$2006 &lt;- 2000
<br />$2006 &lt;- 23C0
<br />$2006 &lt;- 1010 ;Fetch tile 01 for "sprite 1"
<br />$2006 &lt;- 1018
<br />
<br />etc...
<br />
<br />Technically, the first two fetches for the sprites are "garbage nametable fetches" which Brad Taylor's doc says are somewhat unpredictable, but seem to relate to the first tile to be rendered for the next scanline. Thus, I just naively set it to the first tile again to accomodate that. I've left out the rest of the scanline, because this alone should be enough to give us some information.
<br />
<br />When you get to the simulated sprite fetches, A12 will rise 8 times. If the scanline IRQ <em>doesn't</em> fire sometime during the simulated sprite fetches, then we'll know that something more is going on than just simply watching A12.
<br />
<br />If the scanline IRQ <em>does</em> fire in the middle of the simulated sprite fetches, then this test is inconclusive.
<br />
<br />If necessary, I could probably come up with a test rom, but someone will need to test this with an actual MMC3, because I don't have the means to do it myself.

<br />I considered that. However, there's a number of reasons why this specific test might fail, which is why nothing can be concluded if it does. In addition to the CPU's driving being much slower than the PPU's driving, it could also fail because this test doesn't actually read or write anything (so two pins aren't being driven). It could also fail because the garbage nametable addresses I put in are incorrect.
<br />
<br />If it fails from the timing, then there may be an internal countdown counter like kevtris uses, or the path from A12 to the scanline counter may have a capacitor on it to even out the toggling (though that doesn't explain the double-clocks when BG and Sprites both use pattern table 1), or maybe M2 is used somehow (though I doubt it, since that's the CPU clock and not the PPU clock, how would that be useful?).
<br />
<br />If it fails from incorrect driving (for example, the garbage nametable fetches during sprites), then we may need to perform the PPU decapping you proposed in another thread before we can figure out what's going on, or the Brad Taylor document (which I'm using as reference) may have outdated info. Or, the problem could be as simple as the fact that this test doesn't make any actual reads, it just drives the A lines.
<br />
<br />If the test passes though, then we know it must be the specific sequence of addresses put on the A-line, and that'd be one giant mystery solved.
