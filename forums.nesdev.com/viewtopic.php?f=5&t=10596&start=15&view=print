In general, unless it's a portable game, the average price is 7300 yen, which depending of the exchange rate at the time, can be between 70$~100$ US when the identical game would be 50$ in the US.  The only time it is cheaper these days if it's an American/European game sold in Japan, like &quot;The Last Of Us&quot; since foreign games don't sale well anyway.<br /><br />@Koitsu<br /><br />You can try to send something to Brazil but there is no guaranty that the person will receive it in the first place, i.e. post office seems quite, well, not that &quot;straight&quot;, if you know what I mean ... I have experience for a small package I sent once.

All Flash carts I got from Krikzz arrived safe and sound (and pretty quickly too!), but the Famicom cart Banshaku sent me just turned into smoke... Since then I also have lost a Game Boy Advance SP Brighter I got on Ebay (ended up buying a beaten up one from a brazilian seller, along with a new housing, which I have yet to replace). There was also a pack of 5 universal game cases that never arrived, but based on the tracking information things went bad for this package while it was still in the US.<br /><br />I don't know if people really steal these things... I mean, I can imagine someone grabbing my GBA for their nephew or something, but what would a regular person do with a Famicom cart nowadays? Most people probably don't even know what console they're supposed to put that cart in.
