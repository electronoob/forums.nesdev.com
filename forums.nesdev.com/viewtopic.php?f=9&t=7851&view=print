		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Hi everybody! I'm Doctor Nick Rivera with another exciting installment of "Obsessed with Mapper Hardware"; an episode I like to call, "Weekend of the Dead Programmer".
<br />
<br />Yea, don't be too harsh on me. When you do as many mapper topics as I do you try to spice up the intro <img src="./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" />
<br />
<br />Anyway, I've finally decided to start at the beginning and actually get something accomplished. I have made an NROM development board that accepts 28x256 ROM chips, and it actually works! Here's the obligatory <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/qbradq/hardware/nrom-dev-cart" class="postlink">project page</a> with basic instructions and grainy photos of the build process.
<br />
<br />Once I completed the board I fought with my craptastic Willem PCB5 programmer for several hours untill I figured out that the A14 line has gone out (in addition to A15 and A18, which went out previously).
<br />
<br />So I spent Sunday building an EEPROM programmer with an Arduino, a breadboard, some shift registers and about 60 feet of jumper wire <img src="./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /> Finally at around 10 PM last night I ran my first code on an NES. I was so proud, as was my Wife (she's a geek too <img src="./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /> ).
<br />
<br />I'll upload pics of the programmer and first execution later.
<br />
<br />So, for future plans I am wanting to make it so the NES can write bytes of data to the EEPROM. Next I want to make some kind of communication through the controller port happen to the Arduino (just as a USB interface to the PC) so I can rewrite the whole program from the PC. Finally I want to rig up a boot ROM so I can do all of this without having to embed support for it within the game code.
<br />
<br />I think all of this is pretty easy to do with my current setup (except the boot ROM bit, that will take a daughter board and a lot of wires).
<br />
<br />Does anyone know where you can buy 256-byte parallel EEPROM or Flash these days? Or is there a way to run PRG-ROM off of a serial ROM? Either one would really help out on the boot loader bit.

<br />
<br />It comes down to being the ignorant son. I was so ignorant of hardware development that I did not even know about the things I was ignorant of. So now I've scaled it back to where my ability and my ambition are in harmony.
<br />
<br />After I am done with this dev board (and my EEPROM programmer <img src="./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" />) I think I'll have enough experience to tackle an MMC1 board. Really all that it will be adding is some decoding logic and more complex firmware.

You could make a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diode_matrix" class="postlink">diode matrix</a> ROM, heheh. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />  That would be extreme for 256 bytes though.  AFAIK (with 5V stuff), 27C256 and 27C512 are the cheapest parallel memories around.
<br />
<br />Though if you use a parallel flashROM as the main memory, you can boot into it just fine.  It's not as fast to write as SRAM, it's cheap though.
<br />
<br />Sounds cool, it's always fun to see some new hardware working.  When I got RS232 working, first thing I did was draw up a cheesy-looking color ANSI menu screen (I even couldn't resist using the blinking color), for the NES to upload to the PC (in a terminal).  It looked like some kind of old BBS-looking thing came to life when hitting reset on the NES, hehe.  Too bad only I didn't get a screenshot then, because I switched to ASCII for hyperterminal compatibility (which I do have a shot of).

<br />
<br />There's some cheap used 2M (256KB) EEPROMs on ebay $2 each but you've gotta buy 10.  You might be able to find lower quantities if you search around more.  
<br />
<br />here's some 4M (512KB) I had a hard time finding: <a href="http://cgi.ebay.com/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&amp;item=310288839255&amp;ssPageName=STRK:MEWAX:IT" class="postlink">http://cgi.ebay.com/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&amp;item=310288839255&amp;ssPageName=STRK:MEWAX:IT</a>  back when I was looking into memory options for my project.  Ebay was the only place I could find the old big EEPROMs
<br />
<br />But You'll most likely need 12-14V to program and erase, which is a pain in the ass.  That's why I ditched the EEPROM and went SRAM that could be battery backed if needed.  
<br />
<br />Jameco was the only place I could easily find 512KB of DIP packaged SRAM not bad for only $6 each:  <a href="http://www.jameco.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/ProductDisplay?langId=-1&amp;productId=1927617&amp;catalogId=10001&amp;freeText=1927617&amp;app.products.maxperpage=15&amp;storeId=10001&amp;search_type=jamecoall&amp;ddkey=http:StoreCatalogDrillDownView" class="postlink">http://www.jameco.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/ProductDisplay?langId=-1&amp;productId=1927617&amp;catalogId=10001&amp;freeText=1927617&amp;app.products.maxperpage=15&amp;storeId=10001&amp;search_type=jamecoall&amp;ddkey=http:StoreCatalogDrillDownView</a>
<br />
<br />I couldn't find 256KB option with them but more is always better.  SRAM is also has the added bonus as doubling as CHR-RAM if desired.

<br />
<br />I don't really know what rule of thumbs there are for requiring high programming voltages or not, all the ones I found on ebay required it though.
<br />
<br />I just wanted to bring attention to it to be sure and check the data sheet because I almost made this mistake myself.

On the title screen it will be polling the MCU interface to see if there is data waiting, and if there is it will load the boot loader to RAM and execute.
<br />
<br />For the future MMC1 board I will use a 512 KB ROM and use the upper 256 KB as the boot ROM area. Yea, that's kinda a waste of space, but I'm trying to simplify the build process so others can do it easily.
<br />
<br />Thanks for the feedback folks!
<br />
<br />Also, I find Mouser has a great selection of through-hole ROMs. You've just got to be prepared to use 39 series parts.

<br />
<br />Is there a difference between NES and FC here?  My NROM boards are have the CHR A13 and /A13 wired up the opposite way...
<br />
<br />And it doesn't make sense to me with you schematic how PA13 goes to /CS on the ROM, because PA13 is active high right?!?
<br />
<br />I'm wondering if I've got it all wrong somehow...  If I did that might explain why I had the bug with the kazzo on the CHR /A13 signal.
<br />
<br />But now that I check my own FC carts I think you may just have an error.  Because pins 48 and 49 (/VRAM CS and PA13) are shorted together not 48 and 56 (/VRAM CS and /PA13)  like you've got there.

<br />CHR A13 should be the Chip Enable for the CHR-ROM because it is low while the PPU is accessing the pattern tables. FARID's schematic is correct in this regard. That's what I was talking about in the other post: CHR A13 is the Active-Low Chip Enable for the CHR-ROM.

<br />
<br />Sign "/" or "_" indicate active low. What does it mean? Does it mean it is always 0 or GND?! If so I think it should be easy to test with voltmeter, right?

According to <a href="http://wiki.nesdev.com/w/index.php/Cartridge_connector" class="postlink">the wiki page on cartridge board connectors</a> this is "The inverted form of CHR A13.", although it does not specify how it is generated.
<br />
<br />According to <a href="http://nesdev.com/Ntd_8bit.jpg" class="postlink">the FamiCom schematic</a> CHR /A13 is generated by connecting CHR A13 to the base of an NPN transistor.
<br />
<br />I'm a novice at all this digital logic stuff, but without a pull-up resistor I think the CHR /A13 line will float when CHR A13 is low.
