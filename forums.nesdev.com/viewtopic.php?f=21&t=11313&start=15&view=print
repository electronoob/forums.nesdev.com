Due to how YIQ/YUV works, choosing two colors from the same luminance row would yield tolerable results, but you have the problem of being unable to mix with gray, since the available grays are not the same luminance as the colors themselves, so desaturating a color would be harder.

It looks bluer that way, but also brighter than you'd expect from water.

Many other games did this also, e.g. Magician, James Bond Jr. and Jungle Book. Probably because its authors preferred the slightly darker palette.

This gives the screen a certain color tint depending on which bits are enabled. When the red tint bit is enabled, the Dendy incorrectly tints the screen green. This is the kind of problem tepples was referring to.<br /><br />When all 3 tint bits are enabled, all colors are darkened. However, it appears some clone systems darken the colors more strongly than the original NES. And the darkening amount may vary from system to system? See the references below.<br /><br />So it's not exactly the same as what tepples was referring to, but it's related: They're both caused by differences in the tint bits implemention between original and clone systems.<br /><br />References from thread <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/viewtopic.php?t=8899" class="postlink">Incorrect tint on Dendy</a>:<br /><ul><li>In the original post, <strong>Drag</strong> mentions Lion King uses the red tint bit, but in the Dendy Chronicles YouTube series, the host says Lion King has a green tint problem. Drag also says, &quot;Apparently, [...] the amount of tinting depends on the console; for some it's barely noticable, on others it's extremely obnoxious.&quot;<br /></li><li><strong>ccovell:</strong> &quot;Famiclone systems have long been known to have overly-strong colour emphasis behaviour compared to the regular NES/Fami PPU.  This means  games like Bubble Bobble (FDS), Felix the Cat, Magician, etc. are sometimes a bit unclear and harder to play on clones.&quot;<br /></li><li><strong>Shiru:</strong> &quot;Felix the Cat suffered a lot on the Famiclones indeed, the brightness was much lower than in other games.&quot;</li></ul>
