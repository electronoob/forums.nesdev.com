		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Is this the right board for iNES 2.0 submapper proposal discussion? If it isn't, please move this topic to a more suitable board.<br /><br />The consensus (?) proposal for submappers for iNES mappers 21/23/25 is as follows:<br /><br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">3210<br />||||<br />|+++- Which address line corresponds is wired to the A1 in the VRC4a<br />+---- 0: Use next lower address line for VRC4a A2; 1: use next higher line</div><br /><br />However, this encoding (specifically, the use of the high bit) is redundant with the existing mapper numbers. All games that have the two register-selecting address lines in natural order (i.e. the registers that set the low and high nybble of the same CHR bank are adjacent to each other) use mapper 21 or 23, and all games with the lines in reversed order use mapper 25. Since the mapper number consistently indicates what order the lines are in, there's no need to use a bit in the submapper field to specify it again.<br /><br />According to the wiki page for iNES 2.0 submappers, &quot;test ROMs&quot; are needed before a proposal can be accepted. How exactly are these test ROMs supposed to work? I can hack up a VRC2/VRC4 test program that'll test a cartridge (or an emulator implementation) and report which address bits are connected to which lines on the mapper (including multiple bits ORed together), whether 1-screen mirroring is supported (VRC2/VRC4 difference), and whether IRQs are supported (another VRC2/VRC4 difference) if that's what the community is looking for.<br /><br />As an aside, can someone explain exactly what this sentence (from the wiki VRC2 article) is supposed to mean?<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">A third variant (similar to VRC2a but with full-width CHR registers and PRG-RAM) is canonically emulated as using the VRC4, and it's assigned to mapper 25. </div><br /><br />Seriously, what the hell is it supposed to mean that a game is &quot;canonically emulated&quot; using a chip that's different from the one on the cartridge? This kind of nonsense makes me want to run screaming from the NESdev community.<br /><br />ETA: Also, the <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/viewtopic.php?f=3&amp;t=6584" class="postlink">fact that the ending in Ganbare Goemon Gaiden sets the CHR banks wrong on a real cartridge</a> should probably be referenced somewhere on the wiki so emulator developers don't chase spurious bugs.

I proposed this one instead, but nobody has commented:<br /><a href="https://wiki.nesdev.com/w/index.php/NES_2.0_submappers/Proposals#Alternative_Submapper_Assignment" class="postlink">https://wiki.nesdev.com/w/index.php/NES_2.0_submappers/Proposals#Alternative_Submapper_Assignment</a><br /><br />I do not like the mapping tepples proposed because it:<br /><ul><li> Allocates all 16 submappers for <em>no reason</em>. Each of these mappers <em>only has 2 address variations</em>.</li><li> Aside from the 2 current known variants, the rest of the submapper allocations are <em>meaningless</em> because they're already assigned to other mappers anyway.</li><li> Does not encode VRC2 vs VRC4.</li><li> If any <em>unknown</em> variants exist we've shot ourselves in the foot by using up all the allocations.</li><li> Etc.</li></ul><br />The only reason I didn't outright delete that proposal was that nobody else seemed to care, so there was no comment for consensus.<br /><br />My proposal instead was organized with only known variations:<br /><ul><li> 021: 1 VRC4a (A2, A1)</li><li> 021: 2 VRC4c (A7, A6)</li><li> 021: 3 unseen VRC2 (A2, A1)</li><li> 021: 4 unseen VRC2 (A7, A6)</li><li> 023: 1 VRC4f (A1, A0)</li><li> 023: 2 VRC4e (A3, A2)</li><li> 023: 3 VRC2b (A1, A0)</li><li> 023: 4 unseen VRC2 (A3, A2)</li><li> 025: 1 VRC4b (A0, A1)</li><li> 025: 2 VRC4d (A2, A3)</li><li> 025: 3 VRC2c (A0, A1)</li><li> 025: 4 unseen VRC2 (A2, A3)</li></ul><br />The ones marked &quot;unseen&quot; can be omitted, as there's no known cases. They're just to show there's actually a convenient symmetry to them (not necessary to preserve, IMO). The symmetry is:<br /><ul><li> 0. iNES 1 behavior (VRC4 + both addressings)</li><li> 1. Lower address VRC4</li><li> 2. Higher address VRC4</li><li> 3. Lower address VRC2</li><li> 4. Higher address VRC2</li></ul><br />If there's yet another variation that's not covered I think just add it to the end of the list.<br /><br />&quot;Canonically&quot; is a weird word to use but the meaning is that most emulators treat everything as VRC4.<br /><br /><br />I put the &quot;test ROM&quot; requirement in because the submappers page was full of half baked crap that was either untestable or otherwise unimplementable. A test ROM for this should:<br /><ul><li> Determine which of the 2 (or 6, or 16) address line mappings the cartridge it is using has. Since emulators generally support two addressings at once it should report <em>both</em> if true.</li><li> Determine whether VRC2 or VRC4 is present.</li><li> Optionally: test each of the VRC2/4 features to make sure they're emulated correctly.</li></ul><br />Once you've created the ROM, just make one copy for each submapper and change the header for each.<br /><br />Anyhow, that's it, basically. Once you have a test ROM it's very easy for someone to implement the submappers in an emualtor and test them. It becomes clear that you've implemented it correctly only with such a ROM. You can't just run, some VRC2 game and see if implementing the submapper makes a difference because there <em>isn't</em> one. It really does need its own test ROM.<br /><br />A VRC2/4 test ROM has been on my to do list for a long time, but given the lack of general interest in it, I've put it off. If you want to write one that's great.<br /><br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">tepples wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">&quot;run it past kevtris in #nesdev on EFnet and see what he calls plausible&quot; era.</div><br />kevtris never seemed to care if the VRC2/4 mappers got submappers. I don't think there's any known compatibility issues, this is an accuaracy issue only.

That's what submappers are for: to add refined disambiguation to mappers that were otherwise &quot;mostly fine&quot; combined into one iNES mapper before.<br /><br />This is also why I thought it was a terrible idea to pre-emptively allocate <em>all</em> 16 submappers-- there is potentially other stuff still in these categories, besides the 2 or 3 already known cases. It was allocating every single combination of addressings even though the underlying iNES mapper could only support <em>at most</em> four, and very much should not be trying to support more than the <em>two</em> they already have, which was too many to begin with (but we're stuck with).<br /><br />What I am opposed to is adding additional <em>incompatible addressings</em> to 21, 22, 23, 25, making them even more muddled than they already are. The iNES implementation of 21 is a &quot;two-in-one&quot;... don't modify the iNES mapper to make a &quot;four-in-one&quot;. If you find a new VRC2/4 addressing, create a new mapper: it doesn't fit into any existing ones.<br /><br />(Though, this is all moot until someone finds and adequately describes something new in this category anyway.)
