Even if you can't build it, you'd have much better luck with getting someone to do it if the parts were already supplied.  You will need a straight-through parallel cable (male to male, iirc), as you will cut it in half to make both cables.  You well need a little power connector to plug a AC adapter into (find a 5 volt AC adapter for some appliance you don't need and save the AC adapter and rip out the port of the appliance), or you can use a universal AC adapter, but use the 4.5 volt setting...usually works.<br /><br />Next, you will need the other ends of the cables.  I used an SNES AV plug, which is used in several Nintendo systems. However, you MUST make sure all 12 pins are in the connector.  Also, you must be able to open the connector to get at the solder points, unless you get lucky and all twelve wires are actually in the cable itself.  You will need to shave a bit off the connector's outside edge, but it works PERFECTLY, and is virtually the same size as the FDS's expansion port.  As for the other cable, I ripped the female AV socket out of a SNES.  I had to very carefully drill out a couple inside corners of the connector to get the FDS ram adapter plug to fit in, but this port is also perfect otherwise.<br /><br />If you have all this, then you are going to find it MUCH easier to get someone to help you.<br /><br />-Rob<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=200">rbudrick</a> — Mon Apr 21, 2008 10:48 am</p><hr />

I have a Famicom Disk System, but no disks.  I would like to use Brad Taylor's FDS Loader program, but it requires an simple interface.  Unfortunately, I do not have the wherewithal to make such an interface.  Would anyone be willing to do it for a reasonable fee?<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=58">Great Hierophant</a> — Sun Apr 13, 2008 8:46 am</p><hr />
