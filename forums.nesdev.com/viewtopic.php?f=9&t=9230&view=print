		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Hi, guys!<br />I recently placed a pre-order at dragonbox.de.  It's my 1st purchase through them so I'm very new to how things work there.  I was shocked to get an e-mail one day after pre-ordering stating that the item had shipped.  I was even more surprised to log in and see that it was shipped and then listed as delivered one hour later.  This confuses me because I live in the USA and it is shipping from Europe.<br />I've tried to contact their customer support folks for the past two days with no replies.<br />I was wondering, is this kind of hiccup normal, and if so, how has your luck been ordering flash carts from this retailer?<br />My thanks!

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Good hearing from you!  I did order the SD2SNES, actually.  Board only.  A friend of mine put together an awesome shell to go with it =)<br />When I ordered it, it was listed as a pre-order, but about a day later is was marked as shipped.<br />They sent me a message almost 2 weeks ago telling me it had shipped and that tracking info would be sent to me shortly.  It never came, and to confuse things more the item was quickly listed as 'delivered' right after being listed as 'shipped'.  I asked about this.  About a week later they did reply and said that 'delivered' meant delivered to a shipping place.  Weird terminology.  I asked again about the tracing info.  No reply.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I ordered a 'pre-order' sd2snes also, about a week ago. They replied in their email message that they are in high demand and they would be in stock in approximately 2-3 weeks. They also said I shouldn't worry because my board would go out the same day they arrived. I ordered on 8-18-2012. When did you order? I'd like to see how long it takes to actually get the board after they ship it. By the way, I live in the USA also, in Louisiana (New Orleans, were the hurricane is hitting us right now).
