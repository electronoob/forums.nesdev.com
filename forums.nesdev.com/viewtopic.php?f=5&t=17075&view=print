That makes for an interesting argument, but it's meaningless without a demonstration showing that it's actually possible. That got me wondering just how close I could make the SNES sound to a Genesis, and this is the result. Sonic 2 is one of my favorite games ever!</div><br />I read in the comments by the creator (&quot;Kulor Research Labs Inc.&quot;) that it was created entirely from sampled FM instruments from the game. How he recorded these though, is beyond me. Perhaps the most surprising thing to me though, is that he said it only took 22KB, because the instruments were very small. The sound quality could actually be heightened further by having some copies of instruments at different pitches, I imagine, but people already thought he just played the Genesis version. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_lol.gif" alt=":lol:" title="Laughing" />

Handcam plz, or Twin Galaxies might do to you what it did to Todd Rogers and Billy Mitchell. On the other hand, is a real-time speedrun that exploits an ACE vulnerability also a hack?

Unfortunately he didn't have enough time to but he did inspire me to do this:<br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDWbl3YKjj0">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDWbl3YKjj0</a><!-- m --><br /><br />It has Sega Megadrive/Genesis, Sega CD PCM, and a 32X song in there..as well as a couple custom songs.<br /><br />There's multiple ways you can record the FM instruments..from a multitrack that you create by recording one track at a time, etc. But the easiest method is usually taking a VGM file and inputting it into a tool like VGM2TFI. TFI's can then be imported into a Genesis tracker (like VGM Music Maker or Dephlemask) and then you can just sample the instruments one at a time.<br /><br />I employed both techniques.<br /><br />Anyway I didn't want to post a new thread about this when someone was talking about this already. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /> Hope you all enjoy. Here's the SPCs with sources if you want to listen:<br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://tssf.gamemusic.ca/Remakes/Best_of_Super_Sonic_SNES.zip">http://tssf.gamemusic.ca/Remakes/Best_o ... c_SNES.zip</a><!-- m -->

My method for my versions of the songs above we're loading the vgm files as raw files, resampling them without interpolation so they wouldn't sound muffled. I think they turned out well. But definitely are samples. Just really low quality samples

They're trying to dynamically change the square sample in instrument one so maybe the player isn't handling it properly.

No stable media player should ever do that, on any input, so I'm not blaming you for anything, but it's annoying and I can't figure out the cause.<br /><br />The problem tracks are 02, 03, 10, 29 and 44. Are you doing anything in particular in those five?

That being said, there is the final boss track that's part of your list that is dynamically changing sample 1 to different pulse widths. I wish I could be more help!
