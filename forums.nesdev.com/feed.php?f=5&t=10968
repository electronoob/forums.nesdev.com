Yeah, in the meantime, I had also read that those games aren't exact. The new one however is apparently an emulation, even having that 256th glitchy level.

None of the games on it are. I am not sure what hardware it is based on, but it has a TERRIBLE composite encoder and can only make 50% duty square waves. The games on here are mediocre re-writes. Dig-Dug does not play correctly at all and all semblance to the original is superficial. I have not verified proper ghost behavior in pac-man.<br /><br />The Jakks Pacific Ms. Pac-Man one, however, is extremely accurate, and seems to have custom hardware made for it with very well written ports. I say ports because a lot of the weird edge-case behaviors and bugs are present in the games. I notice this most with Mappy. There is one bug, by the way, where after opening a flashing door in Mappy one of the music channels cuts out (the second voice of the main melody) until the level ends.<br /><br />I found a pretty neato debug mode / sound test for the original Plug and Play Ms. Pac-Man unit by Jakks Pacific that showed me that it contained all the sounds to Pac-Man, even though the game was not on there! If I get my hands on one I'll try to document this.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=5314">mikejmoffitt</a> — Thu Feb 06, 2014 8:49 pm</p><hr />

<div class="quotetitle">Dwedit wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"><br />NES Pac-man is a really good port, other than the screen size, it gets the ghost behaviors right.<br /></div><br />Nope, it doesn't. Try it out: In the arcade version, there is a corner where you can move where the ghosts will never follow you. (At least for about 15 minutes.) Try this in the NES version and you're dead in less than 20 seconds.<br />Besides, the NES version doesn't have the exact same labyrinth layout. It comes closer than any other of the old conversions, so, yes, I would say that the NES version is the best port of all 8 bit consoles, but it isn't arcade perfect.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">lidnariq wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"><br />Why would I jest?

Arcade-perfection requires everything to be the same.<br />O.k., if the image is scaled down, that's something we have to swallow if the arcade version uses a vertical monitor. As long as it's only the output itself that's scaled. In memory, the graphics should of course be at full size.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">tepples wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"><br />Unless, of course, the sprite handling in the original source code is abstracted enough (movement vs. display) that the port team can <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93controller" class="postlink">swap views on top of an existing model</a>.

So, unless a conversion looks exactly like the arcade game, down to the pixel (again, except for conversions for modern consoles where the whole screen is clearly in memory and they output a scaled version of the whole image instead of manually resizing the labyrinth itself, as it's done in the NES version), I would declare it non-arcade-perfect.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=6156">DRW</a> — Mon Feb 03, 2014 3:09 pm</p><hr />
