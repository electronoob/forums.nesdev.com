		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Hey guys,
<br />
<br />I have a broken Nintendo DS Phat for sale: 
<br />* The Nintendo DS does not charge from the charging cable anymore due to being accidentally dropped. Everything else on the DS works fine. It plays games and the battery holds a charge.
<br />
<br />I am listing the Wii for $50 and the DS for $30 for anyone interested. They can be either sent into Nintendo for repairs and get a new warranty, or you can do the repairs yourself if you have the expertise. They are just sitting in my room collecting dust so I am trying to get rid of them. Consider this a cheap way to get a refurbished Wii or DS. I remember that Nintendo quoted me $90 to fix the Wii because it was out of warranty. I did not attempt to fix the dropped DS, but I think you can get a refurbished DS for under $90 with a broken DS.  PM me if you are interested. Thanks much.
<br />
<br />
<br />EDIT: The Wii was sold on August 7th, 2009. The DS is still for sale if anyone would like it.

<br />I might be interested in the Wii, I was actually gonna start a thread looking for a broken wii.
<br />Talk about co-incidence.
