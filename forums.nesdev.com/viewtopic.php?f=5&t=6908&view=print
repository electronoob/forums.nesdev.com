<br />Hehe, I did the same with my VSTi synthesizer. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /> I guess it's easier to find good MIDI renditions of Beatles songs than many others.

<br />So do I. Their songs aren't bad, but I'm not a big fan either. I guess that back in the 60's it was exceptional as there was a lower variety of styles of music available back then, and it's the first "young guys with long hair" band that was really successful. So yeah back in the 60s that was amazing, my parents were hardcore fans of them, but I'm not.

<br />
<br />Sure, they influenced a lot of other bands (for better and for worse), and some of their more experimental stuff was pretty good. But it's not like they invented music. Many of their early songs are really quite cheesy (e.g. "She loves you", "I want to hold your hand", "It won't be long").
<br />
<br />Lennon seemed like a pretty nice guy though. I'm not so sure about McCartney.

Combine that with a music teacher who taught them, and by taught them I mean made us listen to and learn facts about them, for half a school year and I can't really stand 'em.
<br />
<br />They were better in their later years, though. 
<br />
<br />Also, I think a lot of electronic bands have been more influential on popular music, such as kraftwerk.

<br />
<br />My mom actually had a short correspondence with Yoko Ono.  What's weird too is that I was born on Yoko's birthday, and my sister was born on John Lennon's birthday (Feb 18th and Oct 9th - not the same years, obviously).
<br />
<br />thefox: That sounds cool!  I really like the mix of pulse and FM-sounding instruments, that's something I'm hoping to achieve in my synth eventually.  Mine is much more primitive sounding at the moment, partly because it's made to be as CPU-efficient as possible, but more because I haven't put any work into the instruments yet..  But hey, I recorded a tune with it just for this thread:
