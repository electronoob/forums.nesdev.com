I don't know if the Neo Geo has DMA or not, nor if I know if you can write during active display, but now I realize that this could be a bottleneck to the system.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Note: I know jack squat about the NeoGeo (and there are multiple system types, some which have capabilities/hardware others might not).<br /><br />Skimming <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://wiki.neogeodev.org/">http://wiki.neogeodev.org/</a><!-- m --> turns up some interesting things:<br /><br />1. DMA is available but only on systems that have CD drives, I guess the LC8953 chip.  DMA cannot be done outside of VBlank, so anything timing-sensitive would need to be done entirely in software during HBlank.  No idea if you can write to VRAM when the GPU is actively drawing or not, but the system does appear to have a native interrupt timer that can fire at specific intervals allowing for precise scanline effects (not sure if mid-scanline or not), but has many caveats.<br />2. The native CPU (68000) can push, according to the DMA wiki page, around 2MBytes/second using repeated <tt style="margin-left: 2px; margin-right: 2px; padding:3px; background-color: #3355aa; color: white;">MOVE.L</tt> instructions (that's a 32-bit move).<br />3. How sprites work on this system is quite different from anything else I've worked on, but I'm not all that surprised since it's mainly arcade-quality stuff rather than (less expensive) consumer hardware (don't ask me about the NeoGeo AES).<br /><br />References for all of this:<br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://wiki.neogeodev.org/index.php?title=Software_rendering">https://wiki.neogeodev.org/index.php?ti ... _rendering</a><!-- m --><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://wiki.neogeodev.org/index.php?title=DMA">https://wiki.neogeodev.org/index.php?title=DMA</a><!-- m --><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://wiki.neogeodev.org/index.php?title=Sprites">https://wiki.neogeodev.org/index.php?title=Sprites</a><!-- m --><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://wiki.neogeodev.org/index.php?title=Sprite_graphics_format">https://wiki.neogeodev.org/index.php?ti ... ics_format</a><!-- m --><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://wiki.neogeodev.org/index.php?title=Scanline_effects">https://wiki.neogeodev.org/index.php?ti ... ne_effects</a><!-- m --><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://wiki.neogeodev.org/index.php?title=68k_interrupts">https://wiki.neogeodev.org/index.php?ti ... interrupts</a><!-- m --><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://wiki.neogeodev.org/index.php?title=Common_pitfalls">https://wiki.neogeodev.org/index.php?ti ... n_pitfalls</a><!-- m --><br /><br />And here's the memory-mapped register doc:<br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://wiki.neogeodev.org/index.php?title=Memory_mapped_registers">https://wiki.neogeodev.org/index.php?ti ... _registers</a><!-- m -->

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Fortunately, working with the AES and the MVS is the exact same deal. There is a minor difference in how sprite data is retrieved from the cartridge, mainly that a part that is usually on-board the MVS is expected to be in the AES for serialization of tiles (this also affects the tables for sprite shrinking). <br /><br />I don't think there's a lot available especially to facilitate sprite attribute updating itself, but the system has a very powerful mechanism for chaining sprites together, as well as auto-animating tiles. The arrangement of a sprite's tiles in VRAM are reminiscient of the Genesis / Mega Drive - the tiles progress in vertical stripes from top to bottom. Look at <a href="https://wiki.neogeodev.org/index.php?title=Sticky_bit" class="postlink">this article</a> on the &quot;Sticky bit&quot;.<br /><br />What I'd really love to see is something like the Mega Drive - oriented SGDK, but targeting the Neo-Geo. The attraction is the completeness of the toolchain and relative ease of setup.<br /><br />Koitsu, I thought the 68000's longword moves were performed as two 16-bit word moves with an auto-increment. Is there really a substantial speed difference?

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />As I understand it (I have looked at ARM7TDMI timing charts but not 68K), the savings come from the von Neumann architecture, which interleaves fetching of instructions and data. Move 32 bits in one instruction and you need not fetch another instruction to move the other 16 bits. Move 256 bits in one instruction (LDMIA/STMIA on ARM or MOVEM.L on 68K) and you save even more time.

All I did was read some documentation/web pages describing the <tt style="margin-left: 2px; margin-right: 2px; padding:3px; background-color: #3355aa; color: white;">move</tt> opcode: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://mrjester.hapisan.com/04_MC68/Sect01Part05/Index.html">http://mrjester.hapisan.com/04_MC68/Sec ... Index.html</a><!-- m --><br /><br />How I interpret the information shown there: <tt style="margin-left: 2px; margin-right: 2px; padding:3px; background-color: #3355aa; color: white;">.b</tt> uses bytes (8 bits), <tt style="margin-left: 2px; margin-right: 2px; padding:3px; background-color: #3355aa; color: white;">.w</tt> uses words (16 bits), and <tt style="margin-left: 2px; margin-right: 2px; padding:3px; background-color: #3355aa; color: white;">.l</tt> uses &quot;long word&quot; (32 bits).  How this is implemented internally (e.g. <tt style="margin-left: 2px; margin-right: 2px; padding:3px; background-color: #3355aa; color: white;">move.l</tt> might move two 16-bit words (high word, then low word)) is irrelevant to me because the end result would be the same (32 bits of data got moved).  Is that not correct?

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />From what I read in another document, the VRAM port can be written to every 12th cycle and is 16 bits wide.  12 just happens to also be the number of cycles it takes to move a word with the 68000, so there that means it can update 33kb per frame, but 5kb during vblank.

So, HBlank (mid-screen) sprite RAM writing is valid and possible.<br /><br />Many games, if you watch near the top of the screen, have a shearing effect on objects, meaning there wasn't enough time to update sprites in VBlank, and it's spilling into the screen.
