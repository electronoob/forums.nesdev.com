Except the part where invisible coin blocks that kill you are ever good.  They aren't.</div>I disagree, but, I guess much of it can be a matter of opinion.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">-ALL CAPS if you can help it.  Understandable though if you can't.</div>Yes, it depend on the font. But I don't think ALL CAPS is necessarily always bad.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">-Forced collection is far worse though.  I could never finish Yoshi's Island for example because my OCD made me <em>need</em> to collect all the crap in the level, but because I was being <em>forced</em> to collect it by negative reinforcement, aka a lesser score, it just pissed me off.</div>I don't understand you very well. If you can still complete the game without it, then why are you saying you <em>need</em> to collect it?<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">-I agree that unnecessary management is bad, but to expound: unnecessary mechanics.  Like, instead of just going down the stairs in Dragon Warrior, you have to select the STAIR command out of a list.  It's not even management at that point.  It's additional button presses and aggravation.</div>Especially if you can remap the buttons to make it work better anyways....<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">-I hope I'm not alone on <em>this</em> one.  When moving platforms change direction with no warning.  Let's say a platform is moving left to right and back again.  I think there should be a brief moment near the change in direction where the platform decelerates, stops, and then accelerates back up to speed, like the pendulums in CV3, instead of, um, all I can think of is one section in Adventures in the Magic Kingdom where jumping from moving platform to moving platform is made unnecessarily difficult by my inability to track their movement.</div>Actually I think is OK moving platforms change direction with no warning, but they should follow a pattern instead of just going at random.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">-And speaking of Mickey Mouse, how about stupid friendly AI?  Stop committing suicide, Minnie, and don't heal me when we have one heal left and my HP is full, generic, computer-controlled RPG ally!</div>I agree it is not so good; the player should be given an option to turn off the friendly AI entirely (whether you fix it or not, but the AI should be fixed if you can). However I think stupid opposing AI is a bit worse.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">-Alarms that never shut up like the low health warning in Metroid, or Navi.</div>Agreed; the player should be given an option to turn off those warnings.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">-Hand-holding.  I don't think anyone here is really into it though, so that's nice.  But to paraphrase that Sequilitis vid and then David Hellman who made Braid:  game mechanics should be given away cleverly as they're needed, not insultingly and before the player can have the joy of his/her own discovery.  Putting the gameplay instructions in the attract mode like Kirby did was an excellent alternative to in-game help boxes.</div>Or put the instructions in the <em>instruction book</em>!<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">-Cliched stories.  I don't wanna save another princess.  Maybe for a change I could <em>be</em> the princess.  Or maybe I go through the whole game to save the princess only to find out at the end that she's the Big Bad Boss...  Yeah, that's still cliche.</div>Yes, is good making up many different idea instead of always the same way; I too do try to make up the games with different kind of stories. (e.g. Instead of killing everyone you have to avoid it.) (e.g. Instead of collecting all of the money you have to leave it alone so that you can claim to be poor or whatever.) (e.g. You could have a second character starting at the end therefore you have to go forward and backward.) (e.g. The end is BIG_MONSTER but they are good, not bad, you shouldn't kill them please (it is MEDIUM_SIZE_MONSTER who is bad); this one is one of my game.)<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">-Making it hard for the returning player to know what he's been doing.  I always thought in RPGs, it would be nice if the record-keeping guy could bring you back up to speed after restoring your save.  Just maybe he doesn't float around your face screaming it at you the whole time you're playing.</div>Maybe it depends on the game and on many other things, whether it would be reasonable to make something like this; possibly it could be a menu which if it is selected, will tell you these things, if you request it, so that it doesn't annoy you otherwise.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">-Sexism.  Female characters don't always have to be sexual or helpless and male characters don't always have to be tough or heroic.</div>Agreed, but I think this is like the &quot;Cliched stories&quot; above, not really separate in my opinion.

Likewise for a pattern with a guideline shown on the background.<br /><br />I guess part of the problem with moving platforms that instantly change direction is inertia. NTSC NES games run at about 60 fps, and any platformer with an adult male hero shown as about 32px tall represents 1 m as 16px. So if a platform's velocity changes from +1 px/frame to -1 px/frame within the space of 1 frame, that's an instantaneous acceleration of 2 / 16 * 60 * 60 = 28.1 m/s^2 = 3 g.

Also, you would have to bend your knees first and push off, making for a really long lag between pushing the jump button and the character actually jumping. Getting fast response from the controls is really important in a game. I hate it when you can't control a character in mid air, also a physical impossibility (without wings etc).
