It wasn't that bad play wise, but the music was awful and I think the graphics were sub par too. Thank goodness they bounced back with Mega Man 3, and my personal favorite, 4, on the game boy.
<br />
<br />That's funny so few people seem to like the Norfair music on the original metroid. I like that track. I don't like it quite as much as the brinstar music or kraid's lair music, but it has this wonderful creepy otherworldly atmosphere to it.

<br />I haven't listened to those in any detail. Except maybe for Balloon Fight on the NES which I've played a lot in the past. And yes, it's one of those early NES games with its typical simple melodies and arrangements. Not exactly the prime of NES music.
<br />
<br />The entire Hello Kitty World soundtrack is awful though imo, so I just picked one track.

<br />
<br />Oscar (SNES) - Horror Set
<br />Packy and Marlon (SNES) - House 4 (from SNESMusic.org SPC set)
<br />Zenkoku Juudan Ultra Shinri Game - Info Screen (from SNESMusic.org SPC set)
<br />
<br />In Packy and Marlon's case, it's terrible sounding, not just with bad notation.
<br />
<br />All of these have SPC sets that can be downloaded at SNESMusic.org/
<br />
<br />Out of all of the above, Oscar is the only one missing a specific person, or people, to blame for making the music (I haven't heard the Amiga version's music). For Packy and Marlon, I blame John Bartelt. For Zenkoku Juudan Ultra Shinri Game, I blame Harumi Fujita.

<br />The tracks aren't bad, just mediocre but why the hell are the samples so damn loud/the other sound channels so quiet? Even a retard can better mix up sound channels.

<br />There might be some more I dislike but these take the cake.

Plus the main theme and ending are great songs.
<br />
<br />Not to mention that the composer is none other than Hip Tanaka, who also did the Metroid soundtrack among several others.

Several tracks in Streets of Rage 3 and Beyond Oasis sound like some kid randomly banging on a keyboard. Just try listening to "Early Beyond Oasis Tune" or "Bad Ending" from SoR3 for more than a minute or two. x_x

<br />SoR2's soundtrack was really good, so what the hell happened here?

<br />Apparently, Japan didn't even get the "original" Balloon Kid until it was released for GBC under "Balloon Fight GB".
<br />
<br />Theirs had a save function, too. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" alt=":(" title="Sad" />
<br />
<br />But yeah, all they had was that strange Z80 -&gt; 6502 machine-converter version for the nes. I wonder what that was all about. o_O
<br />
<br />As for bad vg musics, I want to say Kablooey for SNES, but at the same time, it kinda makes me chuckle a little bit. Who is this person who's so intent on me "getting ready" all throughout the main theme? gegegeget rrrready. Get rrrready. geget rrrrready. etc.
