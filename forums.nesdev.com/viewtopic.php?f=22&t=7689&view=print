		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I finally got around to finishing this game that I started a couple years back, I think it was. Details on how to play are in the game. I haven't talked to the website owner about soliciting for donations, so I'll just skip that part. In case there are folks that don't get to the credits at the end of the game, I would like to mention that the sound engine is DragNSF1. Thanks Drag : )

<br />Nah, the game is finished as is. I spent a lot of time with my testers trying to find a good balance to the levels. I think it was accomplished. Though it might seem hard at first, it's not all that bad really. Don't forget that you have a teleporter at your disposal! I couldn't beat it when I first started playing, but now I have some strategic spots where I lay the teleporter that really help a bunch : )

<br />It seems quite polished and it's also strangely addicting. Certainly one of the "easy to learn, difficult to master" type of games. Me likes :)

<br />In the third (or so) screen, one of the horizontal sparks is patrolling back and forth across a narrow gap. One of the objects I'm supposed to collect appeared in that gap, and it was impossible to collect it without taking a hit. Are cheap hits like this something that the player is supposed to expect and plan for?

<br />
<br />Yeah, that's about as cheap as it gets though. One level (2-4, I think) has a narrow opening in some "crossroads" that it can appear too. It's tough to get those ones without getting hit, but sometimes possible. But hey, no game is perfect!
