<br />
<br />Anyway, the game has a title now.  It is "Battle Kid:  Fortress of Peril".  It took a few days on another forum to finally settle on a title, but I'm glad that's decided.
<br />
<br />Other news, I've got around 425 or so rooms, 35 enemies, and 4 bosses in and will be working on more bosses soon.  Hoping to have 8 total bosses.
<br />
<br />I made a third video and talked about some things.  This video is a little old, but I figured I'd post it:
<br /><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJGEknTXZio" class="postlink">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJGEknTXZio</a>
<br />
<br />Other than that, things are progressing and I'm hoping to be done by summer.

<br />
<br />I like that you can re-use the same checkpoints. Will you be enforcing a life system with limited continues or anything like that?

<br />
<br />Hi, actually yes.  I was planning to have 4 difficulty settings:
<br />
<br />Normal:  Infinite continues and has a password feature
<br />Hard:  No passwords (true for the rest), 50 continues.  Obviously must be done in one sitting
<br />Very hard:  15 continues
<br />Unfair:  Death = back to the title screen.   <img src="./images/smilies/icon_cool.gif" alt="8)" title="Cool" />

<br />
<br />Thank you for including a password system where you just start from a certain location every time. It is SO annoying when there's a super long game, and you have a stupid game over and have to beat the whole thing over again. Infinite continues are wonderful (though in games with lives and continues, there should be extra punishment for losing all lives, even if you have infinite continues).
<br />
<br />Can't wait to see more!

<br />
<br />Or you could follow the example of the 2D Zelda games and Tetris Attack. Store the number of deaths (use 16 bits!), and report that number after each death ("Take 63") and at the end of the game. How much does a battery + SRAM + 4-input NAND decoder cost again?

<br />I kinda planned on passwords from the getgo, so I didn't really think about this.  There isn't a huge amount to save with passwords anyway.

<br />Passwords seem OK though.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />You can go high tech and get one of these newer NVRAMs that have a buit-in battery. Basically you get one of the NVRAMs designed for real-time clocks that also has ab built-in battery, they are cheap and have 64x4 (32 byte) which can be had for under $3. I see some 1Kx8 and larger parts, but I didn't see any that large with a built-in battery.
<br />
<br />Is it necessary to use 1980s NVRAM technology for a 1980s console, or can we adapt some modern that is 5V capable. because it's hardly worth the cost to put bidirectional line drivers on it if you want to save money by buying 3V parts.
<br />
<br />has anyone tried the Catalyst Semiconductors NV SRAMs? like CAT22C10L-20 (18DIP) . Intersil X20C04 series (28DIP) can be had pretty cheap too. Dallas DS12xx are common enough to find used, but those need batteries but can be really big (32Kx8).

<br />
<br />Now there's a pragmatic solution. You're no fun, I demand more $75 NES cart hardware.
<br />
<br />Please make the fonts on the password system big enough to take a picture with a cellphone camera. When I'm on PocketNES or FC Mobile I can never seem to get the River City Ransom passwords take to take a good picture. Megaman 2 passwords works fine though, as do playing it on a real TV set (smallest one is 32" at my place)

So basically, a free one for everyone and a cart version that has a bunch of extra stuff in it, sort of as a reward for people who purchased it. That's just my two cents, though, because if it is made cart-only, I will never end up playing this game which will bum me out.
