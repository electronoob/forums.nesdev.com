						<div class="postbody"><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">So that means that I could essentially write a 20-minute prog rock magnum opus for the 2A03 while adhering technically to the limitations of FamiTone2, GGSound, or whatever format the dev requires for his game and I'll have no problems?</div><br />What that means is that it's impossible to answer generally. If you really, really, really want a general metric, whatever song you want after exporting to whatever format should probably be less than 8KB. The problem with this answer is that it's not strictly impossible to have a larger song. And most devs will probably not want a single song to be that large, but I don't have a number in my head of where a better line is. It depends how much the developer values music. The Super Bat Puncher music is very large for just a few songs if I recall correctly.<br /><br />Note that this 8KB limitation I'm throwing out randomly only deals with a single song. All of the data for all of your songs could be like 256 KB, and that generally wouldn't be a problem for playback specifically, but it would be taking up a lot of space that the dev might want to use for other things.<br /><br />Which... is again why this sort of thing is impossible to answer generally.<br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">If the game is being created with the purpose of being played strictly on emulators, then that would mean I have free reign over the length and complexity</div><br />Okay, let me put it like this: You only get &quot;free reign&quot; through an emulator if you know how to program, because if nothing exists that gives you the space/features you need, you have to add it to the emulator yourself. Just like to get &quot;free reign&quot; on the hardware itself, you need to be able to design/build the PCB that will make it possible. As Tepples said, it's possible to get MP3 quality playback but at that level what's the point of going with NES? A lot feel the same about expansion audio. I don't think there's a commercial USA release that uses expansion audio. If there are, they don't make up more than 1% of the overall library. <br /><br />But the only universal truth is that it's up to the dev. If they both know how to and want to support whatever, you can do whatever. If they can't or don't want to, <em>you</em> can't. So you must ask the dev. Yes. Every time. Unless you are already capable or are willing to learn to build music engines/whatever yourself to help them.<br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"> I wonder if this additional hardware is easy/cheap to manufacture for homebrews?</div><br />The answer is no. And honestly, I'm not even sure it's well emulated yet. If you care about your stuff being played on real hardware, you should expect not to use any expansion sounds.<br /><br />Edit: Hmmm... infiniteneslives is at least working on some boards that supported expanded sound. So maybe you can get there at some point.<br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">I assume that's where the &quot;speed&quot; of FamiTone, GGSound, etc. comes into play, right? </div><br />It's impossible to answer generally. Certain effects (if they're supported), certain instruments might be CPU intensive. The speed of the song itself could matter too, but... impossible to answer generally.<br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">Is this not even possible (or realistic) on emulation-only homebrew dev?</div><br />If you only care about emulation, there's still another problem. As far as I know there doesn't really exist good freely available music engines for expansion sound. (Maybe the famitracker driver is one? But that's not particularly good for games.) I could be wrong on this point and there's something that's just as easy to use for them as Famitone2. But if there's not, what this means is that whoever you pair with has to build a thing just to support your music. And this also locks them into whatever mapper the expansion sound is paired with (which affects how programming will go for many things beyond the music.), unless they also want to build a custom thing that supports the music of the expansion sound and also other things they want.<br /><br />I'd say it's not realistic to expect it for homebrew, no. Maybe for those MMC5 conversion hacks, I don't know enough about them. <br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">I heard that NES data could be compressed from a Reddit post I made asking why there hasn't been a decent ROM hack of Metal Gear yet. There wasn't a lot of info spilt on NES compression, though.</div><br />There's really no such thing as NES specific compression. NES has a CPU like any other. It's limited by RAM and addressing space, but in theory it can do the same things as a modern computer could. Just very slowly. The issue with compression on NES that whatever you want to compress must be able to fit in RAM decompressed, and be able to be decompressed relatively quickly on the weak CPU.<br /><br />What the reddit post could mean is that Metal Gear uses a lot a custom compression formats that haven't been reverse engineered yet. <br /><br />Edit: But ROM hacking (outside of certain graphical things) isn't easy in general. You are editing code you did not write, with no documentation, after it has been assembled. The reason hacks are common for certain games is the hard work has already been done, usually due in part to extreme popularity. Super Mario Bros. has a full disassembly, which is like having documented source code. But... someone had to actually go and figure everything out for that to exist. Same for GUI level editors and things. That's the result of a person spending hours with debuggers trying to figure out what pieces of RAM represented. I would assume no one has done the hard work for Metal Gear yet. <br /><br />Just as a random aside DPCM is not too much fun to support. Even though, yes, Famitone2 does support it, the data for it has to be in a specific place in memory on NES which makes certain things hard depending on what hardware setup a given game uses. My choice to support it is actually causing a lot of problems in a mini project I'm working on.<br /><br />Say I gave you a famitone2 test package. You make your song, export it, double click a thing and you'll have a ROM that will play whatever music you gave (or give you errors if you didn't obey the limitations somehow). Is that interesting to you? This could at least give you an idea of how large certain songs would be in Famitone2.</div>

						<div class="postbody"><div class="quotetitle">tepples wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">On emulation-only homebrew dev, you can in theory just use MP3 music, which simulates an MP3 player being soldered to a Famicom PCB. Heck, on emulation-only homebrew dev, you can make games at PS2 or higher graphical complexity, as Java, C#, and asm.js programs are &quot;emulated&quot; in a way.</div>In my opinion, that is a bit silly. I can describe my own opinions about emulation-only homebrew dev, in order to contrast.<br /><br />One thing about making the .NES format is that you can then use it on many different emulators, including on different devices. Some might not support the mapper in use, although it may also be possible that future versions of that emulator will implement it. Most emulators do support expansion audio as far as I know.<br /><br />Even if you never intend the game to be use outside of emulator, it should still be design to work on real hardware too. There are advantages of such: working better on future emulators, and that in case someone does want to use it on a real hardware, they can do that too (although if you need to, you can use a complicated mapper, which would make it more difficult to use on a real hardware but still possible). I like to think of it as, the program is written for &quot;Famicom VM&quot;, and the different implementations of Famicom VM including software implementations (emulators) and hardware implementations (such as NES and Famicom hardware).<br /><br />While you can use MP3 music, I do not really suggest it (although there are some work-in-progress specification to allow formats such as Vorbis to be provided as a purely optional alternative to 2A03 music on emulators that can support them; a similar work-in-progress specification exists for graphics too)<br /><br />However, of course if you do not want to write your game for &quot;Famicom VM&quot;, you are not even required to do so, as tepples has mentioned. You can use Java or .NET or whatever if that is what you want your game to be, although then you are not writing a NES/Famicom game.</div>

There wasn't a lot of info spilt on NES compression, though.</div><br />It depends on what kind of compression. Some are better suited to the (relatively) small RAM of the NES than others. Methods that involve looking small things up in a static table to get big things, such as byte pair encoding or Huffman coding, work well on NES. So do run-length encoding (RLE), which assumes that the each byte is likely to be the same as the previous byte, and Markov RLE, which uses a table to predict the most common byte that follows each byte. I've used RLE and Markov RLE to compress graphical tile data and map data, and data formats built around Huffman coding or byte pair encoding work well for text. Still other forms of &quot;compression&quot; could be described as clever ways of structuring data to avoid <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fragmentation_%28computing%29#Internal_fragmentation" class="postlink">internal fragmentation</a>, such as a music engine whose sequence data combines 5-bit pitch and 3-bit duration of each note into a single byte.<br /><br />But one popular family of general-purpose compression methods, called LZ77, is based on references to previous decompressed data in a circular buffer. That's not so easy on NES, which has only 2048 bytes of RAM randomly accessible to the CPU unless extra RAM is on the cartridge. LZ77 is easier on the Master System, which has 8K of main RAM; the Game Boy, which also has 8K of main RAM as well as random access to video RAM while rendering is turned off; and on Genesis and Super NES, which have 64K or more of main RAM.</div><br />I feel really out-of-place here because I'm having trouble keeping up with this tech jargon. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_confused.gif" alt=":?" title="Confused" /></div>

						<div class="postbody">There's actually a Game Boy music editor called <a href="http://gbdev.gg8.se/forums/viewtopic.php?id=193" class="postlink">Bleep</a> that's laid out a bit like that. As a contrast to <a href="http://www.littlesounddj.com/lsd/" class="postlink">LSDJ,</a> I suppose.<br /><br />Edit2: I guess while I'm editing I should say that version of bleep is Game Boy, not color. <br /><br />To me the difference is mainly in the axis. One's vertical, one's horizontal. I think there are more problems than layout moving from a traditional musical background to chiptune. Like... you can't hit three notes at once for a chord on NES. Edit: At least not with the same instrument and without expansion sound.</div>

Basically, the answer seems to be &quot;You'll have to figure it out; here's some tools to help you figure it out.&quot;</div><br />So I offered in one of my posts a thing that lets you try out your music using Famitone2's player. Do you want that? I'm not saying figure it out, I'm saying it's on a game by game basis. The questions you're asking simply can't be answered generally. We can help you with Famitone2 specific questions. We can help with GGSound questions. We can't help you make music guaranteed to work for any given game, because that's impossible.<br /><br />So what is your goal? If you're looking to get your music in a game, you can simply post things you've made without expansion chips so people can decide if they like your sound. You may not get responses, but that's more that there simply aren't that many people doing this.<br /><br />If you do get a response, whoever wants your music will definitely help you out with what their game needs. It's just hard to help you with general questions, when it's going to vary based on the project that needs the music. It's not like a modern game where you can just send an mp3 over which will work in whatever project.</div>
