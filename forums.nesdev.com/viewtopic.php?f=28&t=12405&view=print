The rest of the eprom is empty, i.e. no padding/mirroring have been used, although I now have realised that I should have done so.<br /><br />Since I don't have any programmer or such, I wonder if there is any way of fixing my issue? I have read that the higher adress lines can be grounded, but I don fully understand that concept. Which of the pins should be grounded in my case?

IF A20 and A21 are not connected to the cart lines, then pulling those 2 lines to ground will hard-enable the first 8mbits.   But I have burned 8mbit games before on big roms and it wasn't a problem.  It depends on the game I think.  Super Bonk was this way -- even though Super Bonk is 1.5mbytes, I had to mirror it to get it to work.  What game are you trying to make?

But after it's mirrored up to a power of two, you can get away with tying unused high address lines to ground.

The first thing that comes to my mind is that the rom should always be mirrored until it fills out the whole eprom. Would that be a way to totally avoid the situation I am currently facing?
