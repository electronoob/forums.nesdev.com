<br />
<br />As I said, it's nothing fancy. The border at the top just needs to look steady and the new patterns be loaded as soon as possible. Now that I think of it, the fact that the one calibrated for Nintendulator looks correct on the NES doesn't mean it's a perfect match, as I can't know how much after the end of the visible scanline the bankswitch happened. Plus, running the other 2 tests on Nintendulator doesn't seem to match what I saw on the NES for them.
<br />
<br />I've changed the code a lot since those 3 builds, and I'm adding a sprite test as well. I'll show all 64 sprites (8 at a time) right below the border and see if any of them shows up with a blank pattern.

<br />
<br />Each of these ROMs is calibrated to show 16 bright scanlines and then 224 dark ones on each emulator.
<br />
<br />On a real NES, only "nintendulator.nes" has the 16 brighter scanlines complete. The other 2 ROMs have the last bright scanline flickering at some point and it turns dark before the right edge. The one calibrated for Nestopia was the worst one on the NES.
<br />
<br />So I guess your timing is better than Nestopia's, because you can see it's error, but you can't see FCEUXD's error.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />If anyone is still interested, I extended the test. I now put all 64 sprites at the transition between the border and the non-transparent area for better debugging.
<br />
<br />Truth is there are 2 operations that require good timing. I'm use 8x16 sprites in this game, and I'm using CHR bankswitching with transparent patterns to blank the top 16 scanlines, but I don't wanna waste a whole 8KB chunk of CHR (the mapper can only switch that), so I temporally set the sprite height to 8, so I can get away with only 4KB of transparent patterns.
<br />
<br />Anyway, the first important operation is switching the sprite height back to 16. The windows for that is pretty wide though (almost 50 CPU cycles), so there shouldn't be any problems.
<br />
<br />The second operation is switching the actual patterns in, and the window for that is pretty narrow. If it happens too soon, the last blank scanline is glitched. If it happens too late, sprite patterns on the first non-blank scanline will be wrong (either transparent or junk from the 4KB of CHR I decided not to waste). This shouldn't look so bad, players are used to little glitches in emulators and even on the real NES. Plus, sprites usually flicker anyway... I'll probably calibrate for the real console and hope for the best.
<br />
<br />So, with the new test it's easy to see when anything goes wrong. Each group of 8 sprites stays on the screen for a couple of seconds, enough to see if they are transparent (could be because they were evaluated with the wrong height, in which case only the first groups will show the problems, or because transparent patterns were fetched) or have the wrong patterns (colored bright green for easy recognition).
<br />
<br />But it's too late now and there are still a few things to do, but as soon as I can I'll post ROMs with this new test, calibrated for different emulators. I'll also calibrate it for a real NES. I'll hopefully post them tomorrow.

<br />
<br />It can look better on Nestopia. I can easily fix the transparent line of the first few sprite groups, but no matter what I do, wrong patterns will be fetched for the first 3 or 4 sprites rendered.

<br />Can't say for sure based on a single screenshot, since all sprites must be tested, and because of the sprite limit they are tested in 8 groups of 8. Your screenshot only shows the 6th group.
<br />
<br />It appears to be correct though. It is correct when the top section (light gray) and the bottom section (dark gray) are clearly defined (no flickering between them) and all sprites of all 8 groups of sprites (first four groups are colored black and last four are purple) "touch" the light gray section.
<br />
<br />Errors include a flickering scanline between the 2 sections, transparent or green sprite patterns on their first visible scanline (the one that touches the top section).
