NES 2.0 headers have the advantage that they make what you want exactly clear, rather than relying on heuristics.

I guess ReproPak supports it though, which is fine for development just not production.  <br /><br />edit 2: also looks like it is an MMC1 config which would require more than just some wired-up chips correct?  from my understanding MMC1 mapper chips are not something you can just buy in bulk...

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Whether you use SNROM for maximal emulator compatibility is almost entirely separate from the hardware you should use when you actually assemble the PCB.<br /><br />Use good abstraction principles so that you can assemble two versions of the same game, one using MMC1 and one using UNROM.<br /><br />Or, really, just use a NES 2.0 header specifying UNROM or NROM with PRG-RAM and CHR-RAM. Emulators ignorant of NES 2.0 will usually give that to you anyway.<br /><br />If you don't want the more sophisticated features, <em>don't worry about it yet</em>. It's always easy to spec up; it's much harder to spec down.<br /><br />I'll note that with Driar, the original was released as &quot;unknown MMC1&quot;, assumed to be SNROM. I looked more closely, converted it to SGROM, then converted it to UNROM, and after I was allowed access to the source code, converted it to NROM.

Many of those mappers/board conigs are now released.  I'm still working on some of those odd-ball ones like TQROM and such.  One other thing that could probably be added to the wizard is options for &gt;8KB of CHR-RAM.  32KB is basically free, and iNES 2.0 supports it as well.  I'd argue that finely bankswitchable CHR-RAM is the most powerful, versatile, and cheapest option if you're hoping to put your homebrew on hardware.  I initially named them &quot;hombrew TNROM&quot;, but something like &quot;super TNROM&quot; or &quot;super SNROM&quot; sounds a little better.  Perhaps a more technical/explicit name would be better though. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" />  Not much point for something like TQROM for a homebrew IMO.

I love playing the size-vs-speed game of balance in my head and I think I'm really good at it.<br /><br />But I'm not interested in playing with the hardware.  I want to make a game - a good one.  The RAM gives us options.  Better to be forced to optimize things to get costs down when the time comes than to force ourselves to develop something within a too-constricted space.  Code can be replaced.  Better to evolve from simple, stupid code because you narrowed down the scope to something that can be more efficient, than throw away something you spent days on because it was too limiting, creatively, or you decided to switch direction all together.  I want to get to the creative &quot;point B&quot; faster more  than I just want to diddle with the keyboard being clever - the RAM will help.

So, I find myself gravitating back to hardware with all of it's quirks and limitations.  I would point out the obvious in that<br />as we move forward to 'everything on one chip' I see this process fading away fast.  Once these chips are gone, they will be gone<br />forever.  I don't see a resurgence going back to this technology any time soon.
