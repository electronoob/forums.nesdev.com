		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Wait, what are you trying to patch? Because patching formats themselves are system-agonstic as a general rule.<br /><br />For the record, you could probably try to grab an assembler and then generate the patch file yourself (by manually entering the bytes used to make the file and then writing the code that has to be assembled). Not ideal, but it's doable at least (and you would only need an assembler and nothing else).

I used ca65 but the concept (<tt style="margin-left: 2px; margin-right: 2px; padding:3px; background-color: #3355aa; color: white;">.incbin</tt> calculating the number of bytes to the next patch point) probably ports to other assemblers.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />My process for patching an NES game with the cc65 toolset is something like this:<br /><br />1. Play the game in FCEUX making a code/data log.<br />2. Use the log to create a disassembly.<br />3. Create SEGMENTS in the disassembly around the region of code you want to patch (keeps the code following the patch from moving).<br />4. Write the patch.<br /><br />Example code: <a href="http://rainwarrior.ca/projects/nes/startropics_music_fix.zip" class="postlink">http://rainwarrior.ca/projects/nes/startropics_music_fix.zip</a>

I try to do as much annotation as I can just via the info file, so that I can always just re-disassemble when I find something new.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />PCEAS version 3.22 should handle NES stuffs - I think. I also had a build based on this for NESASM, but I don't think anyone was interested. It specifically dealt with this issue; including a binary file to assemble over, but also be able to have an opcode cross a bank boundary (the original would error out). For games that used 16k code banks and such.<br /><br /> You might want to try <a href="http://john.ccac.rwth-aachen.de:8000/as/" class="postlink">ASW (Macro Assembler)</a>. I used this for Sega Genesis in attempting to hack the arcade system-16a Shinobi game to run on the Genesis. I think it supports most 65x processors. Not sure about GBz80.

Y could mean a number less than 7 or 8,

Either way, I'll put it on the list of thing to update for the next release. I plan to update the macro system again (it has the best custom macro system of any 6502 macro assembler that I've used, but it still needs a few more things).
