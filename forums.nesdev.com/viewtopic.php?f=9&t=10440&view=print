		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I got a Top Loader in <em>really</em> bad shape about two years ago, with two NES-039 controllers. I love the way they feel, but they have these cables so stiff they feel like solid-core cat5. It's really dreadful trying to get it in a comfortable position. Is there anything I can do to make this cable a bit softer, short of swapping out the cable for one from a 'square' NES-004 controller?

If you're good with a soldering iron you could get a replacement cord and swap it out.  Dog-bone top loader controllers have  a special connector inside similar to SNES controllers.  Original rectangle NES controllers don't have that connector, that's why you'd have to use a soldering iron. The other option is just replace the controller with one that doesn't have such a weathered cord.  They weren't stiff like that originally.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />The NES and SNES controllers have some of the most flexible game controller cables I've ever used. I've cut them and tried to strip them in the past and they're awful for it, since the &quot;wire&quot; is a thin copper ribbon in a spiral shape (like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rna" class="postlink">RNA</a>) around some string-like fibers. I think this configuration makes the wires almost stretch-proof, since stretching just tightens the spiral and doesn't stress the copper at all, so it never breaks.

It's possible but tricky at best.  Any connection you make with them afterwards needs to have a good stress relief on it.  Because it's easy to break the fragile strands.  It's like coiled up tiny strands of aluminum foil, just slightly better since it's copper.

Typical stranded wire is durable even when striped of it's insulation.  Nintendo's design allows the cost to be reduced by using less copper, but still provide decent durability and flexibility when fully insulated.  NES cords also contain a cotton string inside to provide strength and resistance from being pulled on so all the stress isn't put on the wires.

Thus, it came to me, looking like this on the outside:<br /><img src="http://img542.imageshack.us/img542/8651/4r0j.jpg" alt="Image" /><br />But, when I opened it up...<br /><img src="http://imageshack.us/a/img442/4062/dsc01776e.jpg" alt="Image" /><br />So, my first thought was: &quot;Son of a bitch! Done in by Ebay again!&quot;<br />And the condition of the toploader and the high level of rust on the screws makes me think it was sitting in a junkyard or something. It came from florida, so it could just be sun, but the system obviously wasn't that yellow, but I don't think that it was retrobrighted.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">blargg wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">So far I've found no good close-ups of the special wire it uses, or discussion about it (good luck trying to find &quot;copper ribbon&quot; wire without getting ribbon cable, or &quot;copper strip&quot; without getting hits about stripping wire, ugh).

It worked (besides the reset button) until I started trying to fix it. If anyone knows what I might have done, feel free to offer suggestions.

Does anyone know a likely culprit?<br /><br /><br />... Wow, this is getting off-topic a bit now.
