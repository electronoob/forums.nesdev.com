Pin 4 on a 319x series IC in the NES Control Deck selects between "lock" behavior (in the Control Deck) and "key" behavior (in the Game Pak), and if it's cut, the behavior defaults to key. Because there is no lock in the circuit, there is no lock-<em>up</em>, as if the game were running on a top-loading NES. I know of only one NES game whose mapper requires a signal that the key chip has recognized a lock, and it was never sold at retail. (The Super NES, on the other hand, had two or three coprocessors in ordinary games late in the console's life that required a valid lock for initialization.)</div>
<br />
<br />thanks Tepples, cutting pin 4 did the trick. But I did something really wrong before that. By mistake I cut down pin 4 of U9-8909H(which is 74HC004AP)  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" alt=":(" title="Sad" /> 
<br />Despite U9 pin4 being cut, the game looks to be starting ok. What affect could this accident have on the working of this console?

<br />isn't that u8?
<br />
<br />i'm pretty sure pin 4 on u9 is the slave cic clock signal and you might want to repair that pin, IIRC the cic overheat if it's clocked to slow (or not clocked at all)

<br />
<br />I did not have a small wire cutter to cut the pin. So I instead used the tip of a tiny wine opener(spiral shape). It took out the pin4 of U9 out from the IC. So I fear there is any possibility of soldering it back.
<br />
<br />Anways, U9 chip(i.e. 74HC04) can be bought externally. Will it be ok to replace the chip with a new one.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Yes of course you can just replace the chip. BTW if the console works fine with that pin cut you'd not even need to do this - you'll have to see if there is a wire going somewhere from that pin. If there isn't the pin isn't even used at all so there is no point in replacing the chip.
<br />(I'm to lazy to open my NES and check what is this circuit used for).

<br />
<br />try to find a 74HCU04 if you can, 74HCU is more similar to 74LS in speed than to 74HC, you might be able to use an LS instead if you can't find a HCU.
<br />
<br />would also be possible to solder pin 12 on U10 (or pin 6 on the cic) to the pad for pin 4 on u10, both pins have the same signal and should be able to drive the clock pin for both CICs
<br />
<br />but before you do any of this you might want to check if the CIC in the cartridge gets overheated at all. the pins CIC pins aren't connected on famicom(cartridge)-&gt;nes(system) converters (and probably not on the top loaded NES units) so I might be wrong <img src="./images/smilies/icon_confused.gif" alt=":?" title="Confused" />
