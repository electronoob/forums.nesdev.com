SA-1 support, if it is ever implemented, would be better still, as it would add stuff like Mario RPG and Marvelous to the list of games not to worry about an SRAM battery on.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">Bregalad wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">Also Seiken Densestu 3 (which I'm playing these days) is 32 megabit loads in about 10 seconds, therefore I think Star Ocean should load in about 30 secs.</div>
<br />Well, I'm going on memory alone here (hence the "IIRC"). Pretty sure it was at least 40 seconds though.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />No one plays Doom on SNES. =) I agree that SA-1 support would be nice, but of the games that I know use SA-1 the ones I would care to play are Super Mario RPG, Kirby's Superstar, Kirby's Dreamland 3, and maybe Dragon Ball Z Hyper Dimension.
<br />
<br />When it comes to the games that SD2SNES supports or may support that haven't already been supported by every copier and flash cart ever, for me we are talking about something like 10 games. The two unobtainable ones being Star Fox 2 and Star Fox Super Weekend (well you could buy it but it's crazy). And even those could actually be obtained if you wanted if you threw an eprom in a cart.
<br />
<br />The MSU-1 is a neat feature but I haven't heard much about it being used yet. I thought the most obvious use would have been to add CD soundtracks to games. Particularly games like Castlevania Dracula X or others were great source material could be dropped in. Or people like those at OC Remix remix the entire soundtrack of a game and insert that. Only time will tell.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />For me, the support of those extra few games and the nigh-instant load time are enough of a plus to be worth the little extra. Especially given that, to obtain copies of the games that the other carts don't play, like the MMX games, you'd probably end up spending that much anyway.
<br />
<br />Really hoping SA-1 support is a possibility. As far as I know, Ikari hasn't taken a proper in depth look as to whether he thinks the cart is capable of supporting it yet. If he starts working on it and seems confident it'll happen, the cart will be an instant buy from me =)
<br />
<br />BUT, to stick to the topic, I've only ever ordered a USB adapter from retrousb, so I've fortunately had no reason to deal with the supposed shoddy customer service. Aside from frustratingly long wait times on replies though, seems like he's at least good to honour returns and help fix issues. Eventually.

<br />I have a feeling its the powerpak itself; the SNES powerpak I previously owned a few years ago worked flawlessly. 
<br />
<br />I tried the cf card that came with my NES powerpak, same result. (NES powerpak works great)  I have tried different romsets, from good to no-intro.
<br />I set DMA=0. I have tried the powerpak on both a US and JP snes/sfc. I'm not sure what else to do. I emailed retrousb but I fear it will be a long, long time before I hear back from them from what I've read here and elsewhere.

I should of known if something went wrong I would of been screwed.  A RL friend of mine sent something back to him a few years ago (I was riding with him when he stopped at the post office).  Delivery confirmation said he received the item back, but yet he claimed he never got it, and his excuse several times was "I will check with the post office and see what is going on".  Even after he had PROOF it was delivered.  The guy is a total jerk.

<br />IRC is still a very widely used method of communication. More reliable and far less bloated than most modern alternatives, imo.
<br />
<br />I don't see why you're attacking him, anyway. Yes, there's been some shoddy customer service and people are pissed off, rightly so, but he's given alternate methods of contact through which you are apparently more likely to get a faster response. I don't see why that's a bad thing?
