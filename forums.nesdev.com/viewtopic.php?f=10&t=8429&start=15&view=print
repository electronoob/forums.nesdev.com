<br />
<br />Yes, but compared to NTSC, it looks really good.
<br />
<br />SECAM should look even better than PAL as AFAIKM their color encoding scheme is even more sophisticated. A major drawback in SECAM is however that SECAM video cannot be easily edited because of it.
<br />
<br />Any good photos of NES/Famiclones connected to PAL TVs?

<br />For one thing, some PCs are connected to televisions. Wikipedia has an article about such <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_theater_PC" class="postlink">home theater PCs</a>. For another, the standard viewing distance for a desktop PC is defined as 28 inches (711 mm) according to the CSS specification, not 3.9 inches (100 mm) as you suggest. The difference between TV viewing distance and computer monitor viewing distance can be accounted for by running games at 2x in a window, not the full screen.

<br />Typical CRT 'dot step' for PC displays is .2 to .28 mm, for TVs it probably a bit larger.

<br />
<br />Heh, "standard viewing distance". Ok, 10 cm is too little, but 20-60 cm is common. And I don't think viewing Nestopia in a 2x window on my Windows 7 will capture the experience of playing a real console on TV, apart from the whole "bad fascimile of an NTSC image (forget about those regions that use the higher quality PAL)" on a non-CRT screen. And I like playing in fullscreen.
<br />
<br />Computer connected to TV is a good idea, however, inacessible to me in this moment.

<br />
<br />Probably because an official SECAM NES did not exist, so it probably had to be converted from PAL or NTSC inside the machine, correct me if I am wrong.
<br />
<br />Also, is this SECAM Famiclone you mention Dendy  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /> ?

So how can you achieve a <strong>truly</strong> TV-like image? NTSC on a PC LCD looks <strong>much</strong> worse than the real thing.<br /><br />EDIT - I tried it without the built in aspect correction. It suddenly looks much better. It was almost literally ripping the picture apart before, something that was definitely not a normal NES picture. Now, if the CRT was emulated as well and the scalines actually looked realistic it would be actually like it is on a real NES/Famiclone.</div>
<br />
<br />I have 2 reasons why that picture looks like **** compared to a real NTSC CRT.
<br />
<br />1) The artifact colors rotate/alternate from frame to frame causing your eye to cancel out the artifact colors.
<br />
<br />2) Most NTSC CRTs manufactured after 1990 use a comb filter the chroma signal vertically.

<br />
<br />Because the dot crawl and rainbowing artifacts flicker on an NTSC NES system, but remain static on a PAL NES.

<br />
<br />I have never seen a PAL NES before, but I'm curious to see how it looks like.  I see a lot of NTSC filters, but I can't seem to find the PAL version of them.  The PAL NES should be theoretically better than the NTSC Neo-Geo, since the color carrier is approximately 1.25x faster, but I can't say for sure, since I don't know how a PAL NES looks like.
