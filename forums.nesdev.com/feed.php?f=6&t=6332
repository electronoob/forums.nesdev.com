Also note that the drums don't cut at the same place in PAL and NTSC versions.<br /><br />I also wonder if there's a way to force drums into another music of Battletoads... it would be AWESOME.<br /><br />EDIT : One way to get the title screen music with drums all the time is to highack the music that is played when you beat a level...

Have you tried foo_gep's stereo effect? That separates the channels and adds adjustable echo, which sounds great with headphones (IMO). I'm not sure whether kode54 has allowed complete control of channel panning and echo, but the underlying NSF engine allows it.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=17">blargg</a> — Wed Apr 28, 2010 8:59 am</p><hr />

Hails!  Being a fan of NES music for decades, I was ecstatic when I first started messing around with NSF players to listen to my favorite tracks.  I was also amazed that these NSF players could separate the individual channels for panning and achieving a stereo sound effect.<br /><br />I got in the process of converting lots of NSFs to MP3 format to my music archive (6.5.0.Tunes) for better compatibility, but I kept the stereo effect in them because it made them sound fuller and cooler.<br /><br />Realizing that NES music was specifically made for mono, I was suprised to find a few games with songs that sound like they were created with stereo in mind.  Here's a few MP3s I made NES music that sounds great in stereo..<br /><br /><strong>Silver Surfer - <a href="http://playthenes.com/6.5.0.Tunes/mp3/Level_Theme_1.mp3" class="postlink">Level Theme 1</a></strong><br />From :57 to 1:21 is good stuff in stereo.<br /><br /><strong>Shadowgate - <a href="http://playthenes.com/6.5.0.Tunes/mp3/Subterranean_Caverns.mp3" class="postlink">Subterranean Caverns</a></strong><br />The squarewaves create an echoing effect.  Perfect for cavern music.<br /><br /><strong>Friday the 13th - <a href="http://playthenes.com/6.5.0.Tunes/mp3/Cabin_Fever.mp3" class="postlink">Cabin Theme</a></strong><br />Another off-timed echoing effect.  Nice gloomy sound.<br /><br /><strong>Ghosts 'N Goblins - <a href="http://playthenes.com/6.5.0.Tunes/mp3/Sanctum_II.mp3" class="postlink">Sanctum II</a></strong><br />This song plays during the second quest.  It's chimey.  Notes ring out nicely.<br /><br /><br />You can really hear the difference through headphones.  A lot of these songs seem to use the dueling squarewave method.  I would like to find some NES songs they maybe try something different (maybe a triangle+square combination).<br /><br />Know of any other NES musics that would be good to experiment with?<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=4352">Z.E.N</a> — Wed Apr 28, 2010 12:45 am</p><hr />
