			<a href="./download/file.php?id=927&amp;mode=view"><img src="./download/file.php?id=927&amp;t=1" alt="HudsonSuperMultitap2_PCB (photo by francois g).jpg" /></a><br />

		<br />
	</div><br />The above photos are showing the Hudson Super Multitap 2 (ie. the square &quot;Bomberman&quot; version).<br /><br />It is using only a single-channel switch and only a single chip (IC1: HuC6205B, which must some sort of programmable PAL, or a custom chip specifically for the multitap) (NB. Hudson was also using custom &quot;HuC&quot; chips in some 8bit game cartridges).<br />Interestingly this is different than the &quot;(in-)official&quot; schematic (as far as I know, Nintendo did release such a schematic, with 3 chips and a huge 4-channel switch in book2.pdf, ie. the second book that we won't talk about here). Anyways, it seems that this (in-)official circuit was only some sort of example/prototype, not being used in the actual retail versions (unless Hudson's older long/slim Super Multitaps were using it, or some of the other HORI/BPS or unlicensed ones did do so).<br /><br />If somebody could upload PCB pictures for other SNES Multitaps would be very interesting!<br /><br />Oh, if somebody wants to get rid of a <strong>Tribal Tap</strong> and would like to donate it for research: I'd really love to get one! It appears to be a non-functional fake 6-player adaptor that works only with max 5 players, which is so weird that I'd like to examine that PCB myself.

So now I'm trying to get yellow stains off my multitap.<br /><br />I'm usually pretty good at taking batteries out of things that don't get much use, I guess not on this occasion. Of course I was using cheap Panasonic Carbon Zinc batteries from the Dollar store too. Yellow rusty stains.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I have a TribalTap with the controller ports ripped off (bought it just for the ports, for other projects).  I currently don't have any funds to send it to you, but I can take PCB pics if I can find the thing again... I also have one of the ones Marvelus posted.  There are official schematics in the SNES Developer Docs on RHDN (I posted them <a href="http://forums.benheck.com/viewtopic.php?f=58&amp;t=50337" class="postlink">here</a> if you're interested), but they differ from the multitaps I've actually seen.  The HuC6205B is probably an ASIC that combines the multiplexer and buffers into a single package, though that seems like overkill considering the official version only took 3 off-the-shelf logic IC's, so why the heck they bothered to manufacture an ASIC is beyond me...

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Many thanks for the photos! Nice to see that it's using the HuC6205B chip, too.<br /><br />That HuC6205B chip is a bit more than three 74xxx chips in one package. The difference between the PCB and schematic is that the schematic used <strong>three 74xxx chips</strong> and a <strong>4-channel switch</strong>, the latter one might be quite expensive, might be quite huge, might need more force to get moved, and might be less reliable if some of the contacts get dirty. So it might be reasonable to use a PAL or even to manufacture a custom chip. And some manufacturers appear to do such things even without reason :-)<br /><br />Would be interesting to see how the other multitap manufacturers have solved that. The HuC6205B seems to be Hudson specific, so the other solutions should be a bit different.<br /><br />Tribal Tap PCB photos would be also very interesting! Judging from the text descriptions at <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.neviksti.com/wiki/TribalTap">http://www.neviksti.com/wiki/TribalTap</a><!-- m --> the schematic should look like this <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.neviksti.com/wiki/Talk:TribalTap#TribalTap6_Schematic">http://www.neviksti.com/wiki/Talk:Triba ... _Schematic</a><!-- m --> but I am not too sure if that's free of errors.

	</div><br />The OUT0 signal (IC.pin12) is actually shortcut (via the diagonal wire) with the Data signal from Player 6. That doesn't make sense (two outputs shortcut with each other, without connection to any input; unless I did misunderstood the &quot;TI PAL16L8&quot; datasheet, or unless the &quot;TI PAL16L8&quot; in the decapped chip was just a typo by the chip manufacturer). <br /><br />But then there are two optional diodes, and an optional circle symbol (whatever component <em>that</em> might refer to).<br /><br />The upper diode doesn't make sense to me, it goes to VCC, and should be thus always 'inactive' (unless OUT0 would exceed +5V which should be impossible, or unless it's meant to be a z-diode).<br /><br />The lower diode looks a bit more meaningful, this would allow to share Player 6 Data with the (unused) 2nd Data line from Player 2.<br /><br />Any ideas if and how that circuit could work?<br /><br />If it was really designed to be non-functional from scratch up... then maybe they've added the solder pads for optional components as some crazy legal backdoor... for saying something like: &quot;oh, sorry, we have forgotten to install the gamma diodes and the optocoupler tube on this PCB, that was no bad intention, and we can assure you that, normally, the circuit does work very well with all 6-player games!&quot; or maybe the components are relicts from unsuccessful attempts to make a working 6-player adapter.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Btw. one issue was that the chip cannot latch a &quot;state&quot; bit, and thus &quot;cannot work&quot;.<br />It would actually work without a state bit stored <em>inside</em> of the chip. Instead one could read N-times from the Player 3 input, until the joypad does either output a &quot;0&quot; or a &quot;1&quot; (whichever is desired), and then one could use that bit as &quot;state&quot; flag.<br /><br />The bit should remain unchanged when not sending further CLK pulses to joypad 3 (the PCB has a separate CLK line for port 3). And when using 6 player mode, it should be safe to assume that joypad 3 is connected, 13th-16th bit are typically &quot;0&quot; (joypad ID), and 17th bit and up are typically &quot;1&quot; (unused/padding).

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Those &quot;PAL diodes&quot; are located in the PAL console, as far as I understand they are just crippling the TTL outputs to become open-collector outputs (the purpose may have been to prevent grey imports, otherwise they are totally useless). In a <strong>controller</strong> would need <strong>pull-up resistors</strong> to workaround those diodes.<br />And in a multitap... one would need resistors at the SNES side... and if one should want to reproduce the crippling then one <em>could</em> add diodes to the controller sides, but that would be useless. And the TribalTap is having the diodes only near Player 6 connector, so, no, they don't appear to be PAL related.<br /><br />That circle symbol doesn't indicate any polarity (aside from being a bit miscentered). Without polarity, it doesn't look like a LED or electrolyt capacitor. In so far it does more look like a resistor, inductor, ceramic capacitor, motor, bulb, speaker, electromagnet, push button, wire/connector, or whatever weird polarity-free thing you can think of.<br />Might be impossible to figure out what the circle was intended for... unless somebody does own a Tribal Tap with those extra components installed (?)... or unless... the PCB doesn't have more circle symbols, or does it?<br />qwertymodo, any chance that you could desolder the capacitors (and LED) to see what symbols they have underneath?
