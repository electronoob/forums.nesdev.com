After that you go on to use examples like Ducktales and 1943.  For both of those games, you will definitely require rewiring, and you want to make sure you burn a game that uses their mappers to the board.<br /><br />I assume by "32K" you may mean any game that runs without a mapper, which would be considered NROM or Mapper 0 in the iNES format.  The most popular example there would be Super Mario Bros.  And for any of those games, I believe, there is no re-wiring required.  So for example you should be able to burn Dig Dug II's PRG data to a 32K chip, burn it's CHR data to an 8K chip, and then solder them on a board out of an SMB donor without any rewiring.  (Somebody please correct me if any of that's wrong.)<br /><br />If you would like more examples of games you could burn to a simple NROM donor, here's a search I did on Bootgod's database that shows all NROM games.  <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://bootgod.dyndns.org:7777/search.php?keywords=&amp;ines=0&amp;ines_op==%60@%60&amp;offset=0&amp;field=2&amp;order=asc">http://bootgod.dyndns.org:7777/search.p ... &amp;order=asc</a><!-- m --><br /><br />Also, before burning, you need to make sure you remove the iNES header from the ROM file, which is the first sixteen bytes.  Just open the ROM in a hex editor, delete the first sixteen bytes, and re-save it.  I think that should make it good to burn.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=4230">bigjt_2</a> — Wed Mar 21, 2012 8:36 pm</p><hr />

Hi Guys!<br /><br />Have been reading alot of 'project' topics and pics of carts that are finish and that rly gets me exited to start my own projects in the future!<br /><br />But before I can do that, I want to start small....<br /><br />I want to burn roms to EPROM's and place it on a PCB. To do that i would need:<br /><br /><br />Willem EPROM Programmer PCB50B OR PRG-055 True-USB PRO GQ-4X Willem Programmer Light Pack<br />(I prefer USB because windows 7 support and no old ports..)<br /><br />EPROM Eraser<br />15watt soldering Iron<br />45watt DE soldering iron<br /><br /><br />27c010 Eprom<br />32KB Games on: 27C256<br /><br /><br />Is this correct? I have some double carts that i can use as donor carts like: SMB 2, gauntlet II and excite bike) <br />I have some more, will list them later for comptabiliteit.<br /><br /><br />I want to start small, like open a cart, desolder the pins, get the EPROM out and put it back in. (I have no soldering experience, so i need some practise...)<br /><br />After I get the hang of it i will order a 27C256 EPROM and burn a 32K game on it.<br /><br />Is it correct that I need the same board as the 'original' game? And that if its just 32K I dont need to do any rewirering.<br /><br />Like:<br />1943                            128k PRG / 0k CHR       H       UNROM (2)<br /><br />If i have a donor cart like:<br /><br />Ducktales128k PRG / 0k CHRVUNROM (2)<br /><br />All i need to do is change the EPROM, right?<br /><br /><br />If this is correct this will be my start project, but I would like to know if the above is correct and the equipement is correct as well.<br /><br />Thank you!<br /><br />Greetings, Marcel<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=5235">Gigre</a> — Tue Mar 13, 2012 9:09 am</p><hr />
