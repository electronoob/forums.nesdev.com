<br />Except he doesn't make any good points.  He just takes stuff I say completely out of context, and applies his own twisted meaning to it.
<br />
<br />I don't care if he doesn't clutter up the forums.  He is just manipulating people to turn them against me.

<br />
<br />Oh really?  I just showed smwcentral my SNES homebrew game, and he banned me just because he hated me, not because I actually broke any of the forum rules?
<br />
<br />It's alright for him to constantly make personal attacks on me unprovoked, and I'm not allowed to even defend myself?
<br />
<br />Why?  Is it because he's the moderator at smwcentral, so he is allowed to troll whenever he likes and people will just think he is simply just "doing his duty."

<br />
<br />by sending a civil private message? You've posted a thread where you bluntly admit that you just want to turn people here against someone you don't like, but then you accuse that exact person of doing just that? If anything, pitiful displays of hypocrisy like this only validate the stuff I've sent in the PM you posted. Don't you realise this? You're doing a good enough job of turning people against yourself without me having to get involved, if Kasumi's reply was any indication. Do you have any self awareness at all dude? Why jeopardise your standing in one of the few homebrew related forums that *hasn't* ostracised you?

<br />Do you still have it in your sentbox? If so, and if you still want it public, could you PM it to me so that I can replace the extra-wide image in psyco's post that's not only difficult for people using smaller monitors (e.g. me) but completely inaccessible to people who use a screen reader (e.g. people who hook up wireless headphones and listen to forum posts)?

Didn't expect to wait this long to see it in action though =p<br /> <br />People don't disprespect/alienate/poke fun at you because you don't have a product to showcase, they disrespect/alienate/poke fun at you because of your behavioural issues. That's the same reason you've been getting banned constantly from all these forums. *That's* why you got banned and yeah, it was your own fault and has nothing to do with your ability as a programmer (hahaha what?). People who have meltdowns over the most ridiculous shit generally get banned from forums and you're no exception.<br /> <br />The above paragraph is just stating the obvious but you seem to have a lot of trouble with this concept. It's really concerning that literally years have passed and you're still angry about drama that I would've forgotten ages ago if you didn't keep bringing it up. I smell some deep seated mental issues that I really hope are being medicated.<br /> <br />I'm saying this for pretty much every forum you've been banned from or had drama with so far too, not just this one. The stuff in the OP (and elsewhere) is some of the most twisted logic I've ever seen and it's not the first time I read it either. The petty grudge over something real trivial that happened years ago is just the icing. If what you said were true, the other 1600 active users would be in a lot of trouble right now but somehow they aren't.<br /> <br />I'm closing this since on top of being in the wrong forum, there's nothing good that will come of this. If you'd like to kick and scream at me in PMs that's fine, but shitting up the forums with this sort of stuff will get you banned like it would for anyone else. </div>

<br />Not exactly the best fitting analogy, but close, and what instantly popped into my mind when I read your retort:
<br />
<br />First 30 seconds...  <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfl6Lu3xQW0">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfl6Lu3xQW0</a><!-- m -->
<br />
<br />
<br />Look, psycho teen, mounting a defence like "if you hadn't spilled my beer, this whole bar fight never would have happened" is weak.  You may not be in control of smkd's PM-writing ability, but you ARE in control of your reactions afterwards.  Make them calm and civil (or hell, even do the mature thing and have NO reaction) and you win respect.  Make them knee-jerk inflammatory and you're just digging your own hole.
<br />
<br />Nobody is going to side with you if you carry on like this.  Nobody has sympathy for drama queens.  Nobody is taking sides anyway.  We're just seeing a situation happen that we don't know or care how it started.  And your comportment after such flare-ups is what wins or loses respect from us, regardless of who started what.
<br />
<br />Yeah, so maybe <em>you're</em> right and smkd is <em>wrong</em>.  You win a blue ribbon!

<br />
<br />Go claim your prize for being correct and leave us alone.  Then, now, everyone's happy, right?

<br />
<br />No one forced you to post this thread. No one forced you to post any of the other threads you've made on this. That was your own conscious decision. Do you know what personal accountability is? The thing that gets me about this is that you've blamed others (not just me) in the past for drama that you instigated yourself and that was years ago. I've only remembered it after reading that quote...
<br />
<br />Also, if that PM is inflammatory, keeping in mind I made an effort to make all my criticism constructive, then what do you call this thread you posted? What do you call the other threads on nesdev where you went as far as to <em>create imaginary scenarios</em> to discredit people? You're not in a position to make these sorts of judgement calls.
<br />
<br />ccovell's right. No one else cares about this. That's why I sent a private message instead of cluttering up nesdev like you've done so here and elsewhere. The whole 'fishing for respect' thing while trying to discredit others is beyond pathetic, seriously. You've brought the drama into nesdev numerous times so that pretty much means you're also making this nesdev's problem, not just ours. Why do you think it's OK for this forum to be polluted with this sort of thing just so you can "win" at something so trivial?
<br />
<br />tepples, Kasumi and ccovell make a number of valid points here and the post you quoted from SMWC was also addressed in a few points in my PM if you read it. Please don't ignore them.
