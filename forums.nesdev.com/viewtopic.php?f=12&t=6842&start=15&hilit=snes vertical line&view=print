In order to provide more bits for color base, nametable entries would have had to either double in width, lose flipping, lose a tile number bit, lose priority per tile, or use a second packed table (like the NES does).<br /><br />NES nametable format: tttttttt / cc (for group of 4 tiles)<br />MD nametable format: pccvhttt tttttttt (sprites use same format)<br /><span class="posthilit">SNES</span> nametable format: vhpccctt tttttttt (sprites use one more p and one fewer t)<br /></div>
<br />
<br />I thought this initially two but you can easily get around this without adding more bits to the nametables or sprites. Simply have more Color RAM, and registers that control which palette various layers use. So for example you could have 2, 3, or 4 palette sets of 64 colors. You could choose for Scroll Layer A whether to use the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, or 4th set of 64 colors for rendering. Same with Scroll Layer B (or Window) and Sprites. This would easily have allowed developers alot more color. You probably could have even implemented a cheap way to increase the colors available to sprites, or just added more bits to them as apparently they did have room.
<br />
<br />I really think it's a shame Sega didn't see the need for more color to be available. Other than that the only thing I don't like about the MD is I think the sound hardware could have been better, or atleast I wish it was. But the #1 thing is colors available.

<br />I agree with the 64 colors thing being the #1 issue with the system.  Even in 1988 it seems really shitty when you see the PCE released a year prior with even more subpalettes than the <span class="posthilit">SNES</span>.  
<br />
<br />Games trying to force music that was not made with synths in mind onto the YM2612 comes second for me.  Whenever a game tries and fails to imitate a real instrument (guitar power chords come to mind) it sounds absolutely horrible.  Rock n Roll racing being an incredibly offensive example =p

<br />
<br />That's what really bothers me. The <span class="posthilit">SNES</span> came after, so you can't say Sega was stupid because <span class="posthilit">SNES</span> supports 256 colors. But you can say that the PCE Engine which I think has 512 colors in its sub-palettes was right in their face and they thought or didn't think about how 64 was not enough. That's why the Sega CD was a real drag to me, since the #1 upgrade that would have made it look much better would have been a VDP upgrade that results in more color. The 32X breaks the color barrier, but came too late, and broke the bank too. Plus I think that the 32X is all frame buffers and bitmaps and not your typical PPU or VDP setup with hardware sprites and background layers. I suppose just since it seems like such a minor change could have had a huge impact it's so bothersome. I can't imagine it would have cost anything significant to have add more palette RAM to give BG and Sprites seperate palettes. And I've always said even if it did add cost I think they should have cut out Master System components. Like the Master System only modes left in the VDP.

<br />They did, they removed 4 of the 5 modes supported by the Master System (which didn't matter since only one Master System game used one of those). The main reason why they didn't remove backwards compatibility is because the Master System was successful in Europe and they didn't want to lose the market share there.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />A major downfall for the <span class="posthilit">Snes</span> is it's sprite management.
<br />
<br />As I've already mentioned the <span class="posthilit">Snes</span> only having 4 sprite sizes, pick 2 at one time.  One hardware sprite on the Genesis might require several hardware sprites on the <span class="posthilit">Snes</span>.  This means that eventhough the <span class="posthilit">Snes</span> has 128 sprite entrees and the Genesis has 80, neither of the two has a clear advantage of having more onscreen objects.
<br />
<br />The way 16x16, 32x32 and 64x64 sprites are decoded is annoying.  On the Genesis a 16x16 sprite with a tile number of $00 would take up tiles {$00,$01,$02,$03} while on the <span class="posthilit">Snes</span> they take up tiles {$00,$01,$10,$11) requiring 2 dma loads instead of one.  This is a shame because 16x16 sprites are more useful in games than 8x8 sprites.
<br />
<br />Then there's the fact that the Genesis can use up to 2048 tiles as sprites just as long as you give enough room for backgrounds, while the <span class="posthilit">Snes</span> is limited to only 512 tiles at one time with 2 moveable banks.
<br />
<br />The way it is stored in oam is also pretty dumb, because on the Genesis you have 16 bit x and y coordinates, whereas on the <span class="posthilit">Snes</span> you have 8 bit coordinates.  Then how does the <span class="posthilit">Snes</span> scroll sprites off the side of the screen you ask?  After the main part of the oam there is an extra 32 bytes with the 9th x bit and the size bit for every sprite is stored in an interweved pattern.
<br />
<br />What the hell were these people thinking?

<br />
<br />I have heard both of these reasons before. While it may have cost something significant for 64 more colors and the logic to use different sets for BG and Sprites, I really think it would have been worth the cost. As far as Master System compatibility, perhaps they could have cut it from NTSC versions but retained it for PAL. And also I have always found backwards compatibility to be a luxury feature and not essential. Afterall, if you own SMS games (back when the Genesis launched) then you already own a SMS console. Would you really want to buy PowerBase converter just to play them on this new console? I think the money spent on Master System compatibility was money that could have been much better spent on improving the MD/Genesis hardware, which was the future and the whole point of the product's existence. Scrap SMS, add more colors, maybe more sophisticated sound, suddenly you may have a system that is a whole lot better.
