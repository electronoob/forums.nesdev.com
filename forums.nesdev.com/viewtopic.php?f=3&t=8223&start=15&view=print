		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I am just wondering whether in my emulator, can I use the same buffer for $2007 reads by the CPU and for VRAM reads triggered by the scanline rendering. 
<br />Knowing how PPU works either way would be helpful.
<br />Using the same buffer would make the emulator a bit shorter and less filled with special cases, so there is the motive. But I don't want to do it if it means making the emulator less accurate.
<br />Telling me what a game programmer should do or not do on the NES platform really does not help me in this question, though I appreciate the effort; it may be valid documentation for others. It's just not something that addresses my question.

<br />This will probably introduce more special cases, only allowing $2007 reads when rendering is off. I also believe the PPU has special shifters for VRAM reads triggered by scanline rendering. So I don't think emulating in the way you are talking about is accurate. The $2007 read buffer should only be accessed/modified by $2007 reads. The rest of the PPU hardware should be functionally unaware of that buffer, as it has it's own hardware set aside for rendering purposes.
<br />
<br />Otherwise, I could see all sorts of weird bugs occurring. If the PPU modified that buffer, and the program did some tricky reads via $2007 during rendering, for example.
<br />
<br />Also, I often find it very helpful to consider things from an NES programmer's perspective. Although I have never once in my life written any code to run on an NES.

<br />I have a PowerPak, but a PowerPak won't help me write ROMs that test power-up state. It would help someone write ROMs that test whether a frame's worth of rendering corrupts the $2007 readback buffer, which is all Bisqwit wants to know.
<br />
<br />The only programs I know of that purposely read from $2007 during rendering are the game Young Indy Chronicles and the demo Boing 2007. See <a href="http://nesdev.com/bbs/viewtopic.php?p=62769#62769" class="postlink">previous topic</a>.

I think by now if there were another use, a game would have made use of it, or it would have been discovered. There isn't enough mystery surrounding it to warrant a test ROM, as easy as it would be to make one.</div><br />My message probably was a bit unclear. I wasn't really talking about this case only, it just seems in general that surprisingly few emulator authors are willing to test stuff on the real hardware. There's so much hearsay and guessing on these types of threads, I wish more people would get down and dirty with the hardware to discover some new facts. Then again, I'm not so surprised that this is the case. Like you said, most emulator authors only care about running the games correctly.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">Otherwise, I could see all sorts of weird bugs occurring.

<br />Weird bugs are to be expected anyways if the program attempts to read $2007 during rendering.

<br />This is a good find as it validates the behavior of $2007 reads when $2000.2 == 0 (Young Indiana Jones Chronicles reads $2007 while $2000.2 == 1).  Thanks!
