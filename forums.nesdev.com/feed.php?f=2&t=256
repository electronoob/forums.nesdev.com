First of all, thanks for all the replies!<br /><br />&gt;It's not easy to get a re-compilable dissassembly, but some<br />&gt;dissassemblers by Hyde and Snowbrow manage to do it (with a little<br />&gt;user intervention, I think). <br /><br />Where can I find these? <br />I checked the main parodius nesdev site, but these couldn't be found.<br />Anyway, as it looks like now, my workplan is like this:<br /><br />1. Make the game work in cart mode using a nes-emulator, running using mapper 0. Make sure the zapper works correctly (if it isn't), and somehow set to freeplay, fixing the coin somehow. Maybe the coin insert can be mapped to a button, like select, as I don't think that button is needed in this version.<br /><br />2. Somehow put it on a famicom disc, fix the adresses for that and so on.<br /><br />So well, can anyone point me to a recommended dissassembler for this?<br /><br />Thanks!<br />/Rickard<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=113">Rickard_S</a> — Mon Mar 28, 2005 10:45 am</p><hr />

So, you want to modify the VS rom to run on a normal NES?<br />I think the VS mapper is 99, and I'm not familiar with it, or what is the closest mapper.<br /><br />I'm not sure how different a VS zapper is from a regular one.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=45">drk421</a> — Wed Mar 23, 2005 7:43 pm</p><hr />

Neat idea.  Have you checked the ROMs to make sure they add up to 32kB PRG + 8kB CHR?  I've never played VS Duckhunt, but I wouldn't be too surprised if it did some bankswitching.<br /><br />I don't have an FDS or any dev experience with it, so I can't help you much.  But I can tell you that FDS has a different memory map (because the BIOS), so you'll probably need to disassemble and reassemble the game's code to make it start at $6000 instead of $8000.  That could be tricky.  It's not easy to get a re-compilable dissassembly, but some dissassemblers by Hyde and Snowbrow manage to do it (with a little user intervention, I think).<br /><br />Once it runs, you might need to modify the palette.  That's real easy, I could help with that if/when you get to that point.<br /><br />I think it would probably be easier though to put it on a cart instead of disk.  If it doesn't bankswitch, it wouldn't even need any code modifications (except palette).<br /><br />VS System also has some dip switches, I don't know what the game will do if they're not present.  Probably nothing bad.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=10">Memblers</a> — Wed Mar 23, 2005 7:13 pm</p><hr />

I have for a long time thought about the possibility of playing the VS-version <br />of Duckhunt on a NES using a Zapper! Why, you ask?<br /><br />Because the VS-version had a third gaming-mode, where the dog chased the ducks <br />out of the bushes. But the real cool thing was that the annoying dog is shootable <br />too, and it is coming out with bandages and stuff if it is. =)<br /><br />As I just bought a famicom disc system(which will soon arrive), and have read <br />Brad Taylors excellent instructions on the possibility to transfer discgames <br />directly to the memoryadapter(or the disc drive to rewrite games), maybe my <br />little dream is possible too?<br /><br />In the early days in japan, I believe lots of cart-based games was converted <br />to disc system by pirates, so I don't believe it should be that hard. <br /><br />Concerning that the arcade version requires the coin to be inserted, I read in <br />another thread that the famicom player2-mic uses the same adress as the coinslot, <br />so I believe that shouldn't be a problem (or maybe it is possible to hack the <br />game to freeplay, somehow). The VS-games usually had different palettes, <br />often just totally switched around, as noticed when playing the converted <br />arcade-VS-roms in NES emulators. But in this game, that isn't the case, luckily =).<br /><br />I haven't missed a tool somewhere, that converts early mapper-less <br />games to famicom disc format, have I?<br /><br />Anyway, as the problem is that I don't possess any lowlevel hacking-knowledge <br />myself, and as there is quite a few people here that have knowledge in NEShardware<br />and such, maybe someone can help me out a tad in the constructing of a working disc-image.<br /><br />I have currently asked my little more lowlevel-knowledge brother to hack this <br />up as a birthdaypresent for me, as soon as I can provide all info I can get, <br />but I won't count on it, as he doesn't really have any NES-programming-experience.<br /><br />Anyway, I'm very happy and grateful for ANY help and expertise I can get in this <br />little project of mine.<br /><br />Thanks! =]<br />/Rickard<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=113">Rickard_S</a> — Wed Mar 23, 2005 1:00 pm</p><hr />
