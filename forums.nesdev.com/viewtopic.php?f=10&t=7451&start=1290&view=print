(Y / 16) * (2 * 16) + (X / 16)<br />;= ... ((Y / 16) * 16) * 2 + (X / 16)</div>  Is that correct?</div><br />Looks correct to me. Take care with that optimization you did though: you might look at (Y / 16) * 16 and feel tempted to skip all the shifting, but then you'll be keeping the lower 4 bits of Y, which will screw up the result when you add (X / 16) later. The correct way to optimize this formula is (Y AND $F0) * 2 + (X / 16). Multiplications and divisions are obviously done by shifting bits.<br /><br />Also, since you have only 2 screens worth of collision data, you should ignore the higher bits (you only need bits 0 through 8) of the X coordinate, otherwise you might end up with a pointer to a memory location past the area you have defined for collision data.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">unregistered wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">My collision data is kept in a 15 rows by 32 columns table in 0600-07DF.</div><br />If you add $600 to the result from the formula above, you'll end up with a 16-bit pointer you can use to read from this table. You could even skip adding (X / 16) to the pointer and put that into the Y registers instead. The complete code might look like this:<br /><br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">lda PixelY ;8-bit Y coordinate<br />and #$0f ;same as shifting right 4 times and then left 4 times<br />asl ;shift one more time to complete the multiplication by 32<br />sta Pointer+0 ;the low byte of the pointer is ready<br />lda #$06 ;prepare to add the high byte of the base address<br />adc #$00 ;add to the highest bit (carry) of PixelY * 32<br />sta Pointer+1 ;the high byte of the pointer is ready<br />lda PixelX+1 ;high byte of 16-bit X coordinate<br />lsr ;get the only bit we need from it<br />lda PixelX+0 ;low byte of the 16-bit X coordinate<br />ror ;put the high bit in<br />lsr ;shift 3 times to complete the division by 16<br />lsr<br />lsr<br />tay ;put the row offset in the index register<br />lda (Pointer), y ;get the collision data</div><br /><br />This is just one way to do it. Another approach would be to store the collision data a bit differently, as 2 16x15 blocks, instead of a single 32x15 one. That way you could use only the lower bytes of the coordinates to form an 8-bit index and check the 9th bit of the X coordinate to decide between reading from the first or the second collision table. The options are endless, so pick what works best for you. =)</div> Thank you * 1,000,000 tokumaru!!! <img src="./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /> Being able to see just how it should work meant volumes for me because... I have received help from other threads... I think that's where I got the function <tt style="margin-left: 2px; margin-right: 2px; padding:3px; background-color: #3355aa; color: white;">linear_position</tt> from... and I also had another function called <tt style="margin-left: 2px; margin-right: 2px; padding:3px; background-color: #3355aa; color: white;">use_colTables</tt> that I got from Kasumi... and somehow I mixed them both together so our girl would fall and reach the ground and stop!! <img src="./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" />  And then after fixing some things she began to fall through the ground... and I messed up and couldn't remember how the two functions worked together... until just a little while ago I read your code there and I went and changed <tt style="margin-left: 2px; margin-right: 2px; padding:3px; background-color: #3355aa; color: white;">use_colTables</tt> and <tt style="margin-left: 2px; margin-right: 2px; padding:3px; background-color: #3355aa; color: white;">linear_position16bit</tt> a little and IT WORKS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I'M SO HAPPY THANK YOU SO MUCH TOKUMARU!!  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" />  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /> It was so nice to finally get some code that encompassed the entire method for linear position!  WOOOOOHOOOOOO!! <img src="./images/smilies/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt=":mrgreen:" title="Mr. Green" /><br /><br />edit: <div class="quotetitle">tokumaru wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"><div class="quotetitle">tepples wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">This is what <em>Super Mario Bros.</em> does: a 32x13-metatile sliding window stored as two 16x13 halves.</div><br />This might be a good approach because it better matches the name table layout, in addition to the possibility of accessing any part of each table with an 8-bit index.</div>  this is part of my edit... wow, it would be fun to try this Mario's way (thank U tepples <img src="./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" />)... but it works so far with the 32x15 way that my code does... and I do think that it would be nice to access with an 8 bit index AND also  it would be easier to read the two 16x15 halves ( 16x15 instead of 16x13 because my game doesn't use a status bar unlike Mario who does) instead of the 32x15 thing that I have because the hex editor in FCEUX lists everything in 16 sections... the extra lines will be confusing... but I'm going to create a Monitor covering <s>that</s> <span style="color: #BF80FF">so</span> I'll be able to move <span style="color: #BF80FF">it</span> to see the different sections... that will be fun to make I think...  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br /><span style="color: #BF80FF">final edit.</span>

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />More importantly, you should think hard and decide whether you really need a division by 6. So far it seems you're programming a platform engine, and I can't really think of any reason to divide by 6 in such an engine. Why exactly do you need that division? The best thing to do would be to avoid divisions altogether.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Tokumaru makes a great point. This is low level optimization vs higher level optimization. Maybe think of a way to use divide by 8; come at it with a different approach. But for low level, I would look at factors in the original expression. As in, what's the range for the value that's divided by 6? Is it something between 0 and 31, or such? Is speed a concern (this is done more than once per frame)? Then use a small look-up table.<br /><br /><br />On a side note, there's:<br /> A/6 = A/2 - A/3. But it has a side effect of rounding up/down depending on if the results of the two operations before subtraction (if your division results in tourniqueting the decimal part). It's based on A/C - A/(C+1) = A/C*(C+1) = A/C^2+C.

I tend to have LUTs just for shift+Add or shift+OR for quick address translation for larger tables (it gets the upper address bits for larger tables). Don't forget split tables too (lsb/msb), for faster access. But yeah, a table could have multiple operations/calculations in them.

Debug &gt; Trace logger.<br /><br />This lets you dump a text file containing every instruction executed and the status of every register/flag at each step.<br /><br />2. Conditional breakpoints.<br /><br />This lets you set a breakpoint that also has a condition.<br />See: <a href="http://www.fceux.com/web/help/fceux.html?Debugger.html" class="postlink">FCEUX debugger guide</a><br /><br /><br />For example, if you know that if something is wrong if A is 5 at line $8075, then what you can do it start a trace log at a time before things go wrong, create an execuition breakpoint on 8075 with the condition A==#5, then run until the breakpoint is hit. Stop the trace at this point, and you will have a log of everything that happened up until that breakpoint. From here you can work backwards from the end of the file until you see exactly what caused the problem.</div><span style="color: #FF80FF"><span style="font-size: 200%; line-height: normal"><strong>Thank you * 100000000 rainwarrior!!</strong></span></span> <img src="./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" />  That FCEUX debugger guide page helped me to set an extremely helpful conditional breakpoint! Wooooooooohoooo!  <br /><br />Now I have a question for anyone... How do you accomplish Symbolic Debugging?  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_confused.gif" alt=":?" title="Confused" />  I read about that on the site that rainwarrior linked to... in the section under &quot;Symbolic Debugging&quot;.  In the debug menu I right click on an address and a menu pops up and then I type &quot;AddHealthpoints&quot; and all that happens is that all of the text in the debugger is highlighted.  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_eek.gif" alt=":shock:" title="Shocked" />  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_confused.gif" alt=":?" title="Confused" />   <img src="./images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" alt=":(" title="Sad" />   I just want the address I clicked on to show up as <tt style="margin-left: 2px; margin-right: 2px; padding:3px; background-color: #3355aa; color: white;">JSR AddHealthpoints</tt>... just like the paragraph says.  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_confused.gif" alt=":?" title="Confused" />  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />
