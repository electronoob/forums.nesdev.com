Well, being rather impulsive I've already reverted to windows XP. I don't have the patience required to get linux to, for example, play sound properly, or another example, use vsync in my favorite emulators =D.  What I'm realizing is, if you want linux to work as well as windows you have to make it a hobby. I already have a couple of time consuming hobbies, one of which has nothing to do with computers. So, I'm willing to pay Microsoft $$$ to give me an OS that just bloody works =)  Linux is getting startlingly close to an os that "just works" but it isn't *quite* there yet! (at least not for what I use it for---for people who just want to browse the internet and use facebook I'd say its there)<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3735">GradualGames</a> — Fri Apr 15, 2011 8:31 am</p><hr />

To reduce your chance to install a virus on windows XP, if you would set your main user as not an administrator, that would help in the end.<br /><br />I'm sure people would said "yeah but that wouldn't stop a malicious software to delete files that are not set with administrator rights thought", yes, but the same thing can be done on linux or any OS too.<br /><br />But anyway.  I don't want to say that windows XP is better, it's getting old after all. I just want to re-iterate that all OS have security issues to some degree and depending how you use it, it will make you life harder. So if, for example, use a not really patched XP box in administrator mode with no firewall and using IE6: you're looking for trouble. Same thing for linux in the same condition (it may take longer but it could happen).<br /><br />In the end, it's all in the way you use it. But I don't like OS "wars" anymore so use any OS you like.  I got some virus in the past too on MS OS and it's not because I got them myself, it just other people told me that their external drive "were safe" (...). In normal usage, very rarely.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3559">Banshaku</a> — Wed Apr 13, 2011 3:46 pm</p><hr />

<div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"><br />Which freeware antivirus do you recommend?<br /></div><br />On Windows XP I used a few different ones...<br />The one that I always liked the best, is Malware bytes. It might not be the right thing, because it's completly manual, but it helped me in quite a few cases of virus attacks.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"><br />Well personally I think that "windows vs linux" war is a bit stupid because it's possible and even quite simple to have both of them running on the same machine.<br /></div><br />Very true! I always did that and I never had problems with it. I just never used Windows ever again, unless I REALLy needed it ^^<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"><br />The only VERY important rule is that you need to always install windows first and linux last.<br /></div><br />Wouldn't call this a rule. As long as your Linux system is running properly and you know what you're doing, you can install Windows last. The trick includes hiding the Linux partitions and reserving free space for Windows.<br />Later you will have to manually edit your bootloader config(In most cases that would be GRUB) as well to actually be able to boot Windows.<br />It's tedious, but one thing I learned since I use Linux is, that nothing is impossible. There are just the easy ways and the harder ones.<br /><br />But I agree about the backup stuff ;3<br /><br /><br />About getting the sound right with emulators and/or FamiTracker in wine.<br />I had that problem and I tried many different things to get around it.<br />The closest thing to a solution was to use a low-latency patch on my kernel.<br />It works.<br />But that's it...<br />It doesn't sound nice and I still sometimes have some problems with sound that don't make sense to me...<br /><br />Abput Virtualbox for emulation:<br />I have actually never tried that, cause I'm usually to lazy to boot up a Virtual machine <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" /><br />Sounds possible to me, but I doubt that you'll have better results than with wine.<br /><br />Ubuntu was always my favourite choice. It is true though that it installs quite a bit of useless stuff and it is hard to get rid of it all, but still it is a nice system.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=4824">Grumskiz</a> — Wed Apr 13, 2011 2:45 pm</p><hr />
