		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I have a copy of The Immortal that was sold as-is/broken, but I thought it was curious enough to make a post about because I have never seen anything else like it.<br /><br />I demonstrate the issue with two different TVs with very different results in this video:<br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://youtu.be/3fhyX3HdVcg">https://youtu.be/3fhyX3HdVcg</a><!-- m --><br /><br />First, it's a TLROM board and I verified other TLROM games working on the same consoles. I verified that it was an NTSC ROM. It's been tested on multiple consoles:<br />unmodified front loader<br />unmodified top loader<br />frontloader with CIC disabled<br />frontloader with Blinking Light Win v2 installed and ~15 unused pins removed<br />whatever console the previous owner was using<br /><br />I've tested it with multiple CRTs and LCDs. I get a very different effect on LCDs (less stable image) but the image rolls on both.<br /><br />I've got a feeling that replacing the capacitor might fix this, but I'm still curious to know what could be causing it. I've read that a lot of MMC3 games use a scanline counter to have static HUD with a scrolling screen and I'd guess that miscounting could cause a rolling issue but I don't see a static HUD in this game.<br /><br />Ignore my brother talking about CGA graphic conversion. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" />

I'm reading it but right off the bat I have to wonder if that's really it:<br />It didn't work with at least four different CRTs with no image processor <br />and the same consoles/TVs worked great with Camerica games (Micro Machines, Quattro Sports, Game Genie, and one other Quattro game). This problem with The Immortal seems to affect all TVs and consoles.<br /><br />I'll try to test it with the oldest TV I can find or with my NES that only outputs B&amp;W to see what happens. Thanks!<br /><br />Also, I've googled plenty and couldn't find reports of this with this particular game. If that is the same issue then it's the first report I've come across despite searching. Thanks again!

GOUEYNKN (paused)<br /><br />Edit: sorry, these don't actually do what I thought. I'm realizing now that these were for removing the &quot;emphasis&quot; The Immortal uses to darken the screen further. They don't actually remove the $0D colour, I don't think.<br /><br />These might help, though. Perhaps the problem with the Immortal and not other games is that it additionally darkens it with the emphasis bits? These do disable that, I think.

Only issue is that the Game Genie only allows three at once, but I guess we can do without the title or pause screens. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" /><br /><br />Well, I guess there was one other little issue:<br />The codes labeled &quot;walking around&quot; and &quot;paused&quot; are reversed and the numbering is a little wonky...<br /><br />...but seriously: AWESOME! Thanks again. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /><br /><br />Edit: well, I did a bit of testing and these are the effects I've noticed so far:<br />1. GEOATSKV (pause; title w/out sprite; dialog)<br />2. GPVEASKN (sprite; encounter screen)<br />3. GPOEGSKN (battle)<br />4. GOUEYNKN (walking around)<br /><br />The &quot;w/out sprite&quot; thing is because the screen would scramble as soon as the wizard walked on the screen. If I enter the sprite code instead the screen will stabilize as soon as the wizard walks on screen. &quot;Encounter screen&quot; is just before the battle screen.
