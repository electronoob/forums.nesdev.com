Note that a &quot;add a pixel evern N frames&quot; is subpixel, it's just using a &quot;reciprocal&quot; approach for storing the fraction (1/n instead of n/(2^b)).</div><br />GalaxyNES does what I'd call faked subpixel accuracy (in a way that I think is silly, now. But I didn't know any better.) It allows speeds of less than 1 pixel per frame for every object, but the objects don't store subpixels at all. That said, it still does use a timer so it may fit into your description.<br /><br />The game has a timer that counts from 0-7. (Or 7 to 0. I forget and it doesn't really matter.)<br /><br />Objects have a speed byte. They move (speed/8) pixels every frame. In addition, they move a pixel every frame that the lowest three bits of the speed (-1) are greater than or equal to the timer. (if the lowest three bits are 0, it doesn't do this.)<br /><br />So for a speed of 1, the lowest three bits minus 1 is 0. So when the timer is 7-1, the object moves 1/8, so 0. When the timer is 0, it will move one pixel, because 1-1 &gt;= 0.<br /><br />So all objects with a speed of one will move one pixel on the same frame, regardless of when they started moving. Objects with a speed of 9 and 17 will move their &quot;extra pixel&quot; on the same frame every time. <br /><br />This method also results in uneven speeds. An object with a speed of 4 will move 1 pixel 4 frames in a row, then not move 4 frames in a row. You'd expect the object to move every other frame in this case.

Note that a &quot;add a pixel evern N frames&quot; is subpixel, it's just using a &quot;reciprocal&quot; approach for storing the fraction (1/n instead of n/(2^b)).</div><br />There's the method described in the above post, but swap the bit order (which will actually fix the uneven speed issue).<br /><br />Basically, let's suppose you store coordinates as 16-bit integer values, and you store speeds as 8.8 fixed comma values. Then you also have an 8-bit timer that's constantly counting up (this is global, would affect everything in the game).<br /><br />What you would do is to take the speed value as a 16-bit integer, then add the value of the timer - bit with the bits reversed (i.e. bit 0 becomes bit 7, bit 1 becomes bit 6, etc.). Then just take the higher byte and add it to the coordinates as a normal integer.<br /><br />As for reversing the bits order, well, I don't know much about the 6502, but the idea would be like this:<br /><ul><li>Set A to the value of the 8-bit timer</li><li>Set B to 0</li><li>Shift left A</li><li>Shift right B with carry</li><li>Shift left A</li><li>Shift right B with carry</li><li>Shift left A</li><li>Shift right B with carry</li><li>Etc.</li></ul>Every time you perform those two steps (the two shifts) you're moving a bit. You can try pushing in all bits, but most likely you'll be able to get away with less (e.g. 4 bits may be more than enough for your average platformer). Also you only need to do this once per frame - store the result from B in RAM then reuse it for the rest of the frame.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">psycopathicteen wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">I didn't know the 68k had a SWAP instruction.  Now all the fuss about 32-bit registers are starting to make more sense to me.</div><br />32-bit registers were the most useful in practice in most games is in having more room for calculations, especially anything that's bound to overflow with 16-bit. That makes programming <em>a lot</em> easier.<br /><br />EDIT: er, removed something huge because it went too off-topic. Will just PM him.
