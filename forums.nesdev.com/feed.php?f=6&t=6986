Yes, I believe so. The code would have to be cycle-timed whenever the triangle was running. Probably not an improvement over using $4011.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=17">blargg</a> — Sat Nov 06, 2010 11:49 am</p><hr />

I was trying to engineer it so that $00/$00 would never exist in the registers but it didn't seem to work. Possibly flawed logic and also not a great solution from a musical point of view since it's slightly detuning the period.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3896">neilbaldwin</a> — Thu Sep 30, 2010 1:18 am</p><hr />

It's impossible but I see two potential fixes :<br />- Write a dummy nonzero value to $400b (such as #$07), the real $400a value and the real $400b value<br />- Write in the order $400a, $400b when the period goes upward, and the order $400b, $400a when it goes downward. Sounds a bit more difficult to implement, as you'd have to compare new and old values or something in the like.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=38">Bregalad</a> — Wed Sep 29, 2010 1:56 pm</p><hr />

You mean why the waveform in your screenshot appears to jump back a few phase steps, rather than forward by a few as one would expect? No idea on that. Or perhaps why it occurs at different rates on different emulators? Granularity of them running their emulated APU, or possibly different initial timing or timing accuracy of the emulator in general. Occurrence would be a complex combination of things so that slight changes in accuracy would have a big effect on the pattern of occurrence (e.g. it's chaotic).<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=17">blargg</a> — Wed Sep 29, 2010 1:26 pm</p><hr />
