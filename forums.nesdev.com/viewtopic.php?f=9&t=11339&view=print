		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />As some of you may know, Noah's Ark (E) has corrupted graphics on PowerPak. I looked into it, and it turns out the game is attempting to write to CHR-ROM while rendering is enabled, and some of the writes somehow slip through to PowerPak's CHR-RAM. Note that the mappers <em>do</em> have a configuration flag to disallow writes to CHR-RAM if game uses CHR-ROM, and the corruption only occurs if writing while rendering is enabled.<br /><br />Any theories on what exactly is happening here? Any suggestions on how it could be fixed on the mapper side?<br /><br />CHR-RAM gets only /CS from the FPGA, /OE and /WE are hardwired to PPU /RD and /WR, as far as I know.<br /><br />Attached is the test ROM I used (green = no corruption, red = CHR corrupted).

But it's hard to guess up what the details are here, or what's the timing of /RD, /WR and /ALE in this case. If the timing of the signals was &quot;normal&quot;, you'd expect there to be no corruption, because CHR-ROM is never corrupted while writing to it without rendering enabled (yes, I've tested this).

A misbehaving mapper file would cause similar symptoms. Because of historical complexities related to certain mappers, files implementing a few specific mappers might be more likely to show implementation defects.<br /><br />On the PowerPak PCB, does PPU /WR go through the FPGA or directly to the CHR RAM?

Noah's Ark doesn't have CHR-RAM on the cart.  So, are you saying that on the Powerpak CHR-RAM is somehow being enabled, written to, and because there is no CHR-RAM section of memory it is actually writing over the CHR-ROM section of memory?

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I think so.<br /><br />PowerPak has CHR RAM. As I understand it, when playing a CHR ROM game, the FPGA will deselect the CHR RAM during writes to make it behave like CHR ROM. But if $2007 is written during rendering, the FPGA doesn't have time to do that before the next scheduled fetch. It's like the MMC3 write glitch, where graphics in Crystalis and M.C. Kids got corrupted when early versions of the MMC3 mapper would mirror $Exxx-$Fxxx writes (IRQ disable/enable) to $6xxx-$7xxx.<br /><br />Can the FPGA limit how long the RAM is selected during a single write, or perhaps detect a rendering fetch pattern (like MMC2, MMC4, and MMC5) and disallow writes? Otherwise it's back to Bible Adventures for most of us.

And then /RD comes in to overlap the /WR assertion. Normally ALE would be asserted, then deasserted, then only one of /RD or /WR should get asserted.<br /><br />NOTE: This is just one possible scenario, but shows that the behavior of $2007 writes while rendering can be quite funky.<br /><br />Based on this, I think I was able to fix the problem. My earlier logic (based on the assumption that PPU /RD and /WR are mutually exclusive) was:<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">ce &lt;= ppu_read or (ppu_write and chr_ram_enable)<br /></div><br />New logic:<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">ce &lt;= (ppu_read and not ppu_write) or (ppu_write and chr_ram_enable)<br /></div><br />This seems to have fixed all the games that I know of which had the problem.<br /><br />Here's how to reproduce the problem for each game:<br />- Perfect Fit (U) (CNROM): Select level 1, press B to start level, then select to exit the level, then go back to level<br />- Addams Family, The - Pugsley's Scavenger Hunt (U) (MMC1): Go to password screen, enter code, go back to title screen<br />- Krusty's Fun House (U) (MMC3): Simply run the game, the screen with text &quot;hiiiiii kids&quot; is corrupted.<br />- Noah's Ark (E) (MMC3): Go to first level, background is corrupted.<br />- Baseball Stars II (U) (MMC3): Press start, then A several times, eventually a corrupted screen will appear.<br />- Bigfoot (U) (MMC1): Title screen is corrupted<br /><br />I'll release a new version of PowerMappers at some point with the fix.
