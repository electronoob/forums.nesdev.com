		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Hi all,<br /><br />I understand that nametable changes may only occur within vblank / NMI, since that is when the PPU is free, and that there is not enough time to update the entire nametable during one vblank.<br /><br />What I've done in the past is disable rendering *and* NMI together, then start my updating within NMI immediately afterwards. This seemed to work OK for a simple game going from a splash screen to the game screen.<br /><br />For example: If nametable needs to change  I disable NMI and rendering (probably don't need to disable rendering since I'm already in NMI?), and I update the entire nametable immediately afterwards while still in the last NMI call, then I re-enable NMI and rendering at the end of the current NMI call. So in theory I'm assuming that even though it takes a while to update, no new NMI calls will be made during the process.<br /><br />Generally, if updating the entire nametable, what is the best practice around it and where should the updating code be?<br /><br />Thanks

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />In many cases I prefer to leave the NMI running even if rendering is off, not touching the PPU, but still playing music.<br /><br />You should only turn rendering on or off in your NMI handler during vblank, otherwise you will get a partially corrupt frame.<br /><br />Once rendering is off, you can do it anywhere, the timing doesn't matter*. It's probably a lot more convenient to do this in your &quot;main&quot; thread rather than trying to operate within your NMI (which should be more oriented toward partial vblank-sized updates). Also, like I mentioned above, if you have an NMI routine that lets you skip the PPU and just keep updating sound, you don't get those unpleasant music skips when you move from room to room.<br /><br />* Exception: writing palettes will cause colour to appear in the middle of the screen, even if rendering is off. Palettes should only be uploaded during vblank/NMI. Sprites also should only be uploaded during vblank, but for a different reason (the RAM &quot;decays&quot; over time and will corrupt if you don't OAM DMA immediately before the picture resumes).

The main thread can't do PPU stuff whenever it wants, so it has to signal the intent to do those things so the NMI can effectively do them when vblank hits. The main thread goes &quot;I want to turn rendering off&quot;, and waits for the NMI. When vblank hits, the NMI thread then obeys, and doesn't do any other PPU operations from that point on in order to not interfere with PPU operations that the main thread might be doing, such as updating an entire name table, but can keep doing other timely tasks without &quot;freezing&quot; the program.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I had assumed pubby's 0 to PPUMASK ($2001) was actually supposed to be PPUCTRL ($2000) to disable the NMI and make it safe to change the pointer. Though looking back, the safety is actually provided by waiting for vblank right before doing it. So pubby's given technique was already safe because that <em>jsr wait_for_nmi</em> means NMI won't fire on the next few (thousand) instructions.<br /><br />For tepples' generic &quot;change your NMI jump pointer whenever you like&quot; (do we really need this capability?) suggestion, I would probably have used these &quot;writes&quot; instead:<br />1. Disable NMI ($2000)<br />2-3. change pointer<br />4. Enable NMI ($2000)<br /><br />i.e. directly address the cause of the problem (NMI might happen while you're changing the pointer) instead of doing something <em>even more advanced</em> to transmute the problem into a skipped frame. (...and I think we've neglected to mention that tepples' method additionally requires relocating your NMI to RAM? That's another non-trivial advanced technique to learn about. I'm gonna assume that tepples chose the self modifying method to avoid <a href="https://wiki.nesdev.com/w/index.php?title=PPU_registers&amp;redirect=no#Bit_0_bus_conflict" class="postlink">another even more obscure and complicated issue</a>... but that's another unstated premise. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" />)<br /><br /><br /><em>But</em> now we've gotten to the point where we're talking about how to safely write self-modifying NMI handler code with someone who is asking for beginner advice, and I'm kinda thinking better advice would be: <em>don't do it this way right now</em>.<br /><br />Yes you <em>can</em> write an NMI that starts out with an indirection, but it's one method of a billion equally valid ones for controlling what your NMI does, and the fiddly details of it are a little bit complicated. I don't recommend it if you're at the stage where you're asking OP's question.<br /><br /><br />Here's another way that I think has less complicated ramifications:<br /><br />Just use a variable (here called <em>skip_ppu</em> to tell your NMI to stop messing with the PPU), set it to 1 whenever you need to do your nametable updates in the main thread, and back to 0 when you're ready for it to start doing its thing again:<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">nmi:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;pha ... etc.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;lda skip_ppu<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;bne skip<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;... ; PPU stuff<br />skip:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;... ; music<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;... pla etc.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;rti</div>

In the article koitsu shared I read about setting flags and acting upon them during the next NMI, which I can do but I'm just curious.</div><br />Yes, if you know your code is executing withing vblank, it is an OK time to turn on/off rendering without any visual problem. The exact mechanism of your &quot;Wait_vblank&quot; routine might be important. If it's waiting on your NMI routine to increment a counter, you might need to ensure that the NMI actually returns quickly enough to still be in vblank. (e.g. if your NMI routine also plays music, this may not be guaranteed.)<br /><br />...which is why my general recommendation was to do the turning off directly in the NMI handler. It's usually much easier to ensure that things happening in that routine occur within vblank than stuff in the main thread.<br /><br /><br />The basic concept I recommend is:<br /><br />Buffer everything you want to send to the PPU (the mask value to be written to $2001, the scroll position $2000/$2005/$2005, OAM to be uploaded by DMA, palettes, any nametable updates, etc.), and then when you're done buffering the next frame, you set a flag variable to tell the NMI it's ready and then enter a loop that waits for the NMI handler to use it.<br /><br />The NMI handler itself would check that flag at the beginning, and if it's not set, just do music. If it is set, it knows the main thread is waiting for it and should apply everything in the buffers, then unset that flag (letting the wait loop know it's finished).<br /><br /><br />(This is orthogonal with pubby's update method, the JMP indirection is just a way to have different modes of behaviour for the nmi handler, which you could do still within this buffering scheme.)
