I'm looking forward to the newest Nintendo console.  I think they've started to get the right idea with taking games to a whole different level of gameplay, instead of following all the other companies and taking the consoles to a whole different level of power.  Power is good, don't get me wrong, but if I'm not having fun, I'm not playing.  The controller might seem a bit weird when you first think of it, but I seriously don't see them releasing an entire console with a controller that doesn't work very well.  I was pretty skeptical of the DS when I first heard about it, but now it's one of the two consoles I play more than any other (NES being the other of course <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" /> ).<br /><br />Then again, this is coming from a person who enjoys using the U-Force.

I'm actually again all three consoles : XBOX 360, Revolusion and PS3. I think they're just trying to release the worst console ever made, and for now they all got the rights paths. Even the PS3 controller looks horrible, after the great PS1&amp;2 controller, they just didn't have to touch it. Or better yet, making buttons a bit curved like on the NES, directionnal arrows "fusionned together" like the NES, with the exact design of the PS1/2 controller would make the best controller ever made. They just not have to search that far.<br /><br />I got a new PC for not too expensive, and it runs all emulated games at full-speed and with decent graphics (turn on interpolation to get TV-like graphics).<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=38">Bregalad</a> — Wed Mar 29, 2006 12:44 pm</p><hr />

Nintendo Wavebird wireless sucks much less.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"><br />and the games that needs to be controlled not through buttons, but through movements will always do the wrong movements, etc...<br /></div><br />That's called gesture recognition. From the "weapon" position, as you call it, the thumb can reach the A button and the Control Pad (though not at the same time). The other hand can reach L1, L2, and an analog thumbstick.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"><br />Also, having to handle the controller vertically and having the B button on the back seems to suck to much.<br /></div><br />The B button is used like a shoulder button.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"><br />Also, the controller could serve as a NES controller through backward-compability (I'm not sure how this'll be done)<br /></div><br />Official NES games downloaded through Nintendo Virtual Console will use the lowercase buttons opposite the Control Pad. Super NES and N64 games will likely use the "shell" that the controller slips into.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"><br />,The main reason why I bought a PlayStation and PS2 insted of N64 nor Game Cube, is of course the fact that there is none Final Fantasy games nor Dragon Quest games for<br /></div><br />GameCube has <em>Final Fantasy: Crystal Chronicles</em>. It also has Game Boy Player, which allows playing <em>Sword of Mana</em> for Game Boy (called <em>Final Fantasy Adventure</em>) and any <em>Final Fantasy</em> or <em>Dragon {Quest|Warrior}</em> games for NES or Famicom that will run in PocketNES.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"><br />but also the fact that they went totally wrong on the controllers. The N64 controller is really odd<br /></div><br />At least the left/right position on the N64 controller doesn't feel odd to me when I use it on my PC through a USB adapter.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=9">tepples</a> — Wed Mar 29, 2006 11:41 am</p><hr />
