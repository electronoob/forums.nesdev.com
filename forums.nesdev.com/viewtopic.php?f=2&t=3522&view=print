Bob Rost hasn't made any, and I have zip programming experience, so I know absolutely nothing about what NBASIC (and 6502 assembly) does. &gt;.&gt; I've read the lecture PDFs on his site, and I've also looked at the NBASIC Reference Manual, and I even poured over the code in a few samples, but I still don't really have a clue what it all does. I need something that will describe — in depth — what each command does, how to use it, and a small example that uses it all.
<br />
<br />Can anyone find (or make) me something like that? &gt;.&gt;;

<br />It doesn't? o.O I didn't know… rats. ._.
<br />
<br />In that case, any tutorials on 6502 assembly? &gt;.&gt; Like 'NES 6502 ASM for Dummies' or something? XD

The first level is ok but then the second has missing tiles, and the 3rd there are no background tile at all. Definitely learn to do it in ASM. NES isn't fast enough for having the luxury of some kind of high level language anyway.

<br />Is this always the case? Apple II Plus had a CPU only 57% as fast as that of the NES. MECC's <em>The Oregon Trail</em> for Apple II Plus was written in BASIC with some assembly language support routines.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Oregon Trail also had little/no animation or AI... and pretty much entirely was "prompt user for information and draw a new screen to respond".  So it being compiled in BASIC doesn't seem too far out of left field.
<br />
<br />If you want to write a program that requires any sort of actual performance, however, then I'm sure you're stuck with direct 6502.
<br />
<br />
<br />Also:  I only glanced at NES 101 that was linked but happened to go to a page where he was like "this code doesn't work, anyone know why?".  And he also talked about mapper 2 but failed to mention bus conflicts (in fact he says "it doesn't matter where" you do your register writes).  Both I guess are relatively minor goofs but it got me thinking...
<br />
<br />Why does it seem like all the tutorials on nes deving are written by people who are still learning themselves?

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Sadly no one that is really familar and experienced with the NES writes any tutorials for noobs, that's why. The only people thinking about the noobs are the noobs. I've noticed alot of homebrew and such doesn't even work too. Makes it alot harder to learn. I've been poking around and using Nestopia and Nintendulator for testing. It's interesting too because a demo I wrote that simply scrolls the name tables endlessly works fine on both, but an older versionof FCEUltra flips out and then crashes. I hope there's more PowerPAKs available soon.

The remainder of it that requires strategy doesn't require very much, apparently.  I didn't find it that to get to Oregon as a farmer with all five party members alive, even though it took a little doing. ;-P
<br />
<br />And about 75% of you peeps would probably waste most of the time on the hunting mini-game anyways. :-P
