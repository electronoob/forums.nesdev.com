OK I understand, this would be a way to legally play (and solely backup) games. As I'm sure you know the same thing could be realized far simpler with a simple USB&lt;-&gt;edge interface such as teaguecl's with a portable library. I'm also anti-CRC but should you find a input-less way around it, the more power to you.<br /><br />I don't know about a programmer though, without a doubt the programmer would need user input due since the MCU cannot properly choose algorithms based on product ID alone. Doesn't that negate the purpose of the MSD interface? I definately wouldn't go for a programmer without instantaneous feedback and I'm not so sure I'd even take in a free non-universal programmer anymore. I think energy would be better spent developing a simple yet effective open source ~100-pin USB universal programmer and control software which utilizes high level scripts. <em>That</em> truely would be a milestone in the programmer world, it may be the end of device support overhead due to the open algorithms.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=20">kyuusaku</a> — Wed Dec 14, 2005 6:42 am</p><hr />

I agree with kyuusaku, what danimal is describing is just mapping a filesystem to a removable media (in this case a cartridge).  For purposes of playing a game back, this really isn't that great an idea.  It's no better than playing off a hard drive image, except that it's much slower.  In addition, the many variations of cart hardware make the FS implementation difficult - when you could just as easily have separate user space apps for each specific piece of hardware.  It's an interesting idea, but not worth the effort imo.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=29">teaguecl</a> — Tue Dec 13, 2005 11:51 pm</p><hr />

I'm a "little" lost, by copier do you mean simply a backup device (ie no playback)? It sounded like you wanted a backup only device where a MCU does all the work and presents the PC with files similarly to a digital camera, that is until you start talking about EEPROM... I don't see how EEPROM fits into any of this unless your concept intends to playback games. <br />Also could you clarify what you mean by this:<br />"Theoretically you could emulate the 72 pin connector this way and run the emulator strait off the rom and all the copy tools and features you want, easily."<br />That sounds to me like an entirely different project for playback.

I am developing a USB based cart dumper, I'm calling it CopyCart.  The schematic is done, I'm going to be ordering my first set of boards in the next week or so.  I have set it up to use the USB as an emulated UART, and defined a simple protocol to read/write from any address.  That way, all of the "mapping" smarts stay on the PC (equivalent of CopyNES's plugins).  The PC software is written in Python, which means even though I'm developing on Linux it should work just fine in Windows.  I'll post more info here when I get some web space set up.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=29">teaguecl</a> — Mon Dec 12, 2005 11:10 pm</p><hr />

The serial device would be used for direct single-byte reads and writes to the buses; the mass storage device would allow for speedy bulk reads of raw 512 byte segments of CHR (sectors 0 to 31) or PRG (sectors 32 to 127) data. Sure, you'd need specialized software to control this sort of mapper, but it should be reasonably portable across different operating systems that know how to speak USB.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=9">tepples</a> — Mon Dec 12, 2005 5:44 pm</p><hr />

In another topic it was mentioned that a USB based cart copier would be a good idea.  I agree with that Idea, especially since MB manufacturers are moving away from Parallel and Serial ports and some people report limited success with PCI based alternatives.<br /><br />I have done some googling and checking and here is what I found:<br /><br />First I looked at USB and found that the memory sticks all have a common driver called USB Mass Storage Device.  This is a standard driver specified by the USB standard documents.<br /><br />Second I thought, this is one step away from writing a cart too so I started looking for EEPROM Programmer based on a USB Mass storage device.  (I realize that because not all EEPROMs (and Mappers) are the same this may be a bit naieve).  This is the closest thing I have to the idea:  <a href="http://www.sslug.dk/~chlor/prom/" class="postlink">http://www.sslug.dk/~chlor/prom/</a>  .  To overcome the mapper problem and any exceptional situtations a CRC database could be in the device's Firmware.<br /><br />Third, since there is no USB Mass Storage Device based EEPROM Programmer, is there a USB-MSD development kit.  I did find a few but their descriptions are a bit beyond my current technical level.  I do intend to bridge this knowledge gap.<br /><br />Based on my current understanding is that the device should work this way:<br />A controller checks a connected cart's CRC, matchs it to the database then, creates a ramdrive of the ROM Data.  If writing wants to be done, hooks in the controller can be used to store it in the ram drive then copy to the EEPROM.<br /><br />Possible directory structure:<br />&lt;device&gt;/prg/&lt;1, 2, 3, ..., page numbers&gt;<br />&lt;device&gt;/chr/&lt;1, 2, 3, ..., page numbers&gt;<br />&lt;device&gt;/unif/image.unif (.nes and pasofami too)<br />&lt;device&gt;/info.txt (basic information file of the ROM ie CRC number, etc)<br />&lt;device&gt;/firmware/firmware.bin<br /><br />What do you guys think?<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=241">danimal</a> — Mon Dec 12, 2005 5:16 pm</p><hr />
