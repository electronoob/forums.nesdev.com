		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Regarding colors being off: welcome to the main reason why so many people hate NTSC. This is why NTSC TVs have a hue setting, which can change the colors completely. The saturation setting tends to be just as bad about this as well. For example, another color that tends to be dangerous is magenta, since it has a tendency to turn red.<br /><br />Trying to account for different TVs is futile, they're all just way too different (especially for NTSC).

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I actually really like the NES's palette because it's YIQ/YUV based. Trying to pick colors using raw RGB is harder because the luminance varies greatly depending on the hue, which is a problem if, for example, you're trying to make differently colored blocks all have the same relative lightness/brightness, especially if you're working with a very low resolution RGB, like RGB222.<br /><br />Also, on a CRT, SMB's sky color looks like an extremely vibrant blue, not like the washed-out purplish blue a lot of emulators seem to give it. I like using hue C for stylistic purposes, but I go with other shades of blue if it clashes too much with the rest of the objects in the scene.

This really seems to depend on which system one learned first, doesn't seem like any of them is particularly more intuitive in the long term (they still have their own advantages with other operations though, e.g. hue-based systems have it easy if you just want to change the hue, but simulating light addition/substraction is much easier with RGB, etc.).

But even though it's not that great of a palette, many of the problems I described plague a lot of palettes.<br /><br />...Except for Joel Yliluoma's <a href="http://bisqwit.iki.fi/utils/nespalette.php" class="postlink">NTSC palette generator</a>. That thing produces freakin' gorgeous palettes! The reds and yellows are really strong and the contrast is great. That mockup I made up there? I got the palette for it from Joel's generator with the saturation set to 2.0.
