<br />
<br />1 - If the cathode is on the HC161 side (on the mapper side) :
<br />
<br />The diode will prevent current to go from the mapper to the ROM.
<br />Here you are the trurth table for one single bit :
<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">A B&nbsp; OUT<br />0 0&nbsp; 0<br />0 1&nbsp; ###<br />1 0&nbsp; 1<br />1 1&nbsp; 1</div><br />Legend :<br />A = NES connector CHR-Ax from the PPU<br />B = Output of the HC161 mapper<br />OUT = Voltage that will be applied to the ROM pin CHR-Ax<br />0 = Logic 0 (0 to 0.8 V)<br />1 = Logic 1 (2.4 to 5 V)<br />### = Bus conflicts will appear. Avoid this state at all costs.<br /><br />2 - If the cathode is on the CHR-Ax side :<br /><br />The diode will prevent current to go from the CHR-Ax signal to the HC161 mapper.<br />Trurth table :<div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">A B&nbsp; OUT<br />0 0&nbsp; 0<br />0 1&nbsp; 1<br />1 0&nbsp; ###<br />1 1&nbsp; 1</div><br /><br />In other words, in the fist case, a '1' should always be written to the mapper, and the diode has no effect. If '0' is written, bus conflicts will alsmost certainly appear, unless only one pattern table is acedded or something.<br />In the second case, a '0' should always be written to the mapper, else bus conflicts will almost certainly appear. However, when zero logic is written, the mapper direcly controls the CHR adress lines, and the PPU has no effect. This allow for software pattern table swapping, and the PPU has no effect. This is interesting, however, I'm not sure of the accuracy of this since I've no board with slot for diodes. The only CNROM boad I have has it's mapper D4 and D5 tied to VCC and no slot for any diodes. I think it's a more recent board, because it's something like 'NES-CNROM-09' instead of 'NES-CNROM-256-01'.[/code]

<br />
<br />Most likely the reason that only FC carts used this mechanism was because in Japan around 1986 there was a primitive NROM/CNROM copying device; it consisted of a base unit which would simply copy the ROM from a source cart to an erasable (ultraviolet) EPROM cart. The rest of the world (even China) wasn't keen on NES piracy at the time.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Well from what I can get, all CNROM games using those diodes actually are NROM games on a CNROM board. (I mean they could run on NROM without that protection stuff, the '161 is used ONLY for protection and not for bankswitching).
<br />Now I really don't understand the effect of those diodes. To disable the CHR, the mapper would have to connect to CHR /OE on the CHROM, and it doesn't seem to do so. Also, since those games check one bank and make sure it doesn't work before selecting the bank wich is supposed to work, it sounds like the banking bits (D0-D1) are being used somewhere. But, if the CHRROM is always 8kb on those weird games, those latches are not used, and connects to nowhere.
<br />A system to disable the CHROM would basically have a gate from the latched mapper value and leave the chip of its tristate mode only if the values matches. But those diodes seems to rather fool the PPU when attempting to communicate with it's CHROM chip. I think those games relies on bus conflicts to work, tough I really make no sense of this without shematics.
<br />
<br />I think this method was so bad that Nintendo did give it up fastly, and developped the lockout chip for the NES instead. On a CNROM game one could just disolder the ROMs and dump them since they have standard pinout. With one of those tools that can grip ICs, it could be dumped without even being disoldered.

<br />
<br />As for reading the ROM directly, I actually have done this. I originally only bought Mighty Bomb Jack, when I saw those diodes on there, I suspected it had something to do with them. So I bought some more games that I thought would have different diode patterns according to that table, and they did. But I still was (am) unclear exactly what is going on. I desoldered the CHR ROM and first tried to read it as an 8K ROM (27C64) and got nothing but noise. Then I tried 16K, and the data showed up in the upper 8K. I also read it as a 32K to see if it would be in the uppermost 8K of that, but it wasn't, it was all noise except for the 2nd bank. What the hell does that mean? The pinout must not be standard? The ROMs (LH2367xx) are certainly 8K, so I do not understand why they would read like that.
<br />
<br />BTW, if you try to read these ROMs thru CopyNES, without setting the proper "key", you get odd results too. For instance with MBJ, if you dump it as a 32K ROM, you get the same results as above. banks 1,3,4 are typical open-bus reads, and the 2nd bank is the real data, interleaved with a bunch of shit. The noise it's mixed with will always be different too. I'm guessing there is a full-blown conflict going on, probably not too good for the cart :/

<br />Yeah, and where they lead if possible.
<br />
<br />Maybe Nintendo did just replace the upper adress lines by additionnal output enable pins, and that all must be set correctly to be enabled. Then, in function of how the internal logic mixes output enable to actually enable the output, a certain configuration should be set to have the ouptut enabled.
<br />Typically, on mighty bomb jack, A13 is instead OE and A14 is /OE. So if and only if A13 is high and A14 is low the output is enabled.
