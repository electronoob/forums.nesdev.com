		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />When I recently purchased my new Samsung 40" LCD FullHD TV I experienced a problem with my NES. The image is "bouncing" up and down, which looks like just a few pixels, all the time. I experience similar problems on my WII when running Virtual Console NES games. I've read something about that certain tv's can't handle such low resolution (240/256p?) and could cause wierd behaviour, which I suspect is the problem on my tv.
<br />So, how can I fix this? <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />
<br />Is there some external hardware that can be bought that increases the resolution somehow?
<br />
<br />I've also tried my old Famicom A/V with the same jumping result.

<br />
<br />In this case, it was a professional "scaler" with 240p to 540p upscaling, with only 4ms delay, and 540p turns off the scaler in my TV as it's a native scanrate, the Zapper worked.
<br />
<br />And yea, the one I borrowed costa  couple grand.

<br />Well it's not the signal.
<br />
<br />It's the image processing that TV's introduce.  My HDTV by itself, introduces a delay that is approximately 1-2 frames behind, this makes the zapper not function and miss a shot.
<br />
<br />The professional scaler I used however only introduces a 4ms delay, and works perfectly fine, as long as the scaler is set to a native mode of the HDTV.
<br />
<br />LCD's still failed the test, possibly from native latency.  Didn't test a plasma.

<br />it should, yes.  But I wouldn't trust an LCD.
<br />
<br />They don't make CRT HDTV's anymore, but if you can find one that has a mode that the scaler shuts off (usually 540p and 1080i), you might get away with it.
<br />
<br />I used the "Radiance" scaler, worth a lot of cash, and my friend wouldn't trust me alone with it..  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" />

The sensor bar has 2 IR LEDs and the Wiimote has an IR camera.  The LEDs appear as 2 bright dots, which it can use for horiz/vert/rotation processing.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">peppers wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">so if you have a tv with a 4ms responce time a zapper will work on its own?</div>
<br />The Zapper will only work on a CRT with the correct TV frequency.  It should not work on computer screens, LCDs, plasmas, or projectors.  You can adjust the Zapper circuit to work on different frequency CRT computer screens, but then the computer TV card may introduce too much of a delay.

<br />Hey, my photoshopping from my hoaxing days wasn't well executed.  It was caught after all.  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" />
<br />
<br />But anyway, if anyone can borrow the "Lumagen Radiance" scaler, try it on your HDTV with the zapper.
<br />
<br />540p is the same 60Hz as 240p, electrically, and as long as the TV doesn't try to process it, it should work, as in my case.  I used a Prima HT2778P...  (there's two versions of these..  mine doesn't use the red mouse cursor on the OSD)..

<br />Actually, the zapper just looks for a white square.  It either detects white, or not.  White = hit, not = miss.
<br />
<br />Sega however, I believed with the Enforcer, and the gun on the PlayStation that die hard uses, used the electron gun's beam as a guide.
<br />
<br />I know that the delay in an LCD though is far too much for the zapper to detect that white square.
<br />
<br />thing is, for my video, my HDTV is a CRT, running at I believe 59.9Hz (but could be 60Hz), and at 540p, it's no different than a regular TV running 240p.  No scaler or processing at all.  I just needed to use an external scaler that has a dedicated mode for 240p sources to upscale, with as little as a delay as possible.

<br />
<br />
<br />and also if the zapper just looks for white how dose it know what duck you shot when there is more than one on the screen?
