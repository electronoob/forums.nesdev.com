For example, I've looked at Patater's NESASM tutorials and am trying to wrap my head around the differences for CA65.  Currently I'm trying to break down what you are doing with setup of the PPU and loading of sprites/backgrounds.<br /><br />Can you shed some light on this in the form of either a more detailed explanation or links to further documentation ?

I think the only place it uses sprites at all is choosing the number of players.<br /><br />Which &quot;setup&quot; are you talking about? The init code? Name a comment or a .proc and I'll explain what's going on below it. Or do you want a line-by-line breakdown of all 560 lines of main.s, all 85 lines of pads.s, and all 69 lines of random.s? If part of the program is confusingly undercommented, let me know. I don't want too few comments, but I don't want too many either.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">Can you shed some light on this in the form of either a more detailed explanation or links to further documentation ?</div><br />Have you explored <a href="http://wiki.nesdev.com/" class="postlink">the wiki</a> yet?

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I think I've got enough understanding of nes development to do some damage now. =)  The one thing that I am still a bit fussy on is setting the colors of the sprites.  For example, if I have a tileset that has mario in the typical SMB colors, I load it up and draw mario's head and it's in the wrong color?  I know the palette plays a part, but I'm still fussy on how that all works together.  Once upon a time I think I had found a document explaining it in the documents on this site, but am not finding it now.

I just had FCEUX as my original emulator to &quot;Play&quot; games, and it happened to have some debugging tools.  I'm definitely going to check out the other tools that Nesicide has to offer.  I'm still new to all of this (but not assembly in general), so I'm evaluating everything trying to see what I feel most comfortable with.  So far I like Nesicide and think that the CA65 assembler has far more logical syntax than the NESASM line of assemblers.  I just have to work with it more and slow down and take the time to understand what is going on with each line.
