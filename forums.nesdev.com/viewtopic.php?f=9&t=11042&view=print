		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Hello all. So I'm planning on building myself a MMC5 cart and I'm having trouble finding out the best option as far as the eeprom I should get for it. The rewiring guide I found for the MMC5 boards was likely using a 27c040 or above cause it labeled pin 31 as A18. Whilst looking at some pinouts I discovered some of the smaller memory ones have this pin as PGM. <br /><br />What I'm wondering is this.... My rom will only have a 32k PRG and an 8K CHR. What is the smallest possible EEPROM I can use for the MMC5 Boards?. For reference I'm currently using the  NES-ELROM-01 from the Lazar Invasion carts. (I even populated the missing audio caps and resistors)<br /><br />I'm assuming a 32-pin EEPROM is required, and I'm also thinking that 27c040 will be my best option but I want to really make sure before I go forward. I also just want to minimise the amount of time I will have to copy my data using 'copy /b' to fill up the rom chip. <br /><br />Thanks in advance.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I'm confused cause I have a chip on it that says 27c040 on it, and it has a window to the wafer as well. The one you stated with the 'F' instead of 'C' does not have one. I'm guessing it's a flash chip instead of a UV erasable EEPROM. Plus, the pinout is different.<br /><br />EDIT: I see my mistake. I originally wrote &quot;EEPROM&quot;. I guess I just meant &quot;EPROM&quot;. Sorry for the confusion.  <br /><br />I have a UV eraser and a EPROM programmer. I don't even know if flash chips are supported on my particular programmer. <br /><br />I still would like to find out if there is any alternatives to the 27c040, cause it's rather large for my purposes.

You only have to connect the address lines that exist on the EPROM. If your EPROM doesn't have an A18, then you don't connect A18.<br /><br />However, you do need to connect all of the EPROM's address lines. If you're using a very large EPROM that has A24, you can't leave that pin unconnected - you must connect it to ground.<br /><br />Why do you want to use such a small EPROM? Wouldn't it be better to use the largest supported by the MMC5? (If extending your file to fill the whole chip is the only reason you want such a small EPROM, you are asking the wrong questions.)

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />EEPROMs are simpler to program than UVEPROMs. (They usually can be programmed with just one voltage, and it's often 5V, instead of UVEPROMs often taking both 12-15V and 5.5-6.5V). It seems likely that your programmer will support them, unless you picked up something free and ancient from before the time of EEPROMs.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I want to use a small eprom cause my PRG will only be 32K. and my CHR only 8k. I'm using a modified version of vegaplay. I'm unsure if I can even assemble a rom bigger then the default size. If there is a way I would love to hear how I can achieve this. It would give me more room for music.  And yes the copy /b process is a bit annoying but also smaller eproms are more readily available to me and cheaper. <br /><br />So If you are saying I can use something like a 27c256, how do I connect it up? just match the pins that are present and ignore any the chip doesn't provide? I'm going to be making a socketed cart, so I want to get the wiring right on the sockets for the chips I will ultimately be choosing to use.

(The MMC5 only &quot;wouldn't&quot; need initialization if you had only 8 KiB of PRG and 1 KiB of CHR, so ...) So you may as well use a larger ROM at that point and take advantage of it... unless the cost difference is really noticeable.<br /><br />What are you using to write the music in the first place?

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Well, once you have the MMC5 configured to 32k-at-a-time mode, you could just staple together a series of independent 32k programs into the same ROM. You'll need to include a little stub to take care of switching between them all, but that shouldn't be very difficult. (The stub would be something like <tt style="margin-left: 2px; margin-right: 2px; padding:3px; background-color: #3355aa; color: white;">STA $5117; JMP &#40;$FFFC&#41;</tt>, and it would need to be at the same address in each 32K bank)

The other just tells the NES CPU &quot;pretend you rebooted, but leave the PPU and mapper untouched&quot;.<br /><br />In practice, you'd also have to add an option in the menu to let the user switch between banks.

For example if you take a 27C040, you can connect A18 to GND and it will function exactly like a 27C020. You don't even have to replicate the data with copy /b, you can simply program the lower 256KB of the chip.<br /><br />So, if all you want is 32KB, you can connect A15, A16, A17 and A18 to GND. The only problem with this is that it becomes impossible to use the chips for more data if you decide to do so in the future, this wiring will permanently lock you to 32KB. If instead you connect all the address lines properly and use the copy /b trick, you can make use of the full capacity of the chip later on without hardware modifications.

Then, for using dip32's I'd just fill it up with redundant code.
