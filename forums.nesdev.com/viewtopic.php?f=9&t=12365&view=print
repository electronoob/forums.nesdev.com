		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Hello. My name is Kaneko and i am together with my wife running a webshop on Aliexpress. I just thought that you guys might be interested in our products since we are now selling them internationally. <br /><br />Basically what we have is everything from old hardware clones, to our own new product called the &quot;DIY-8-Bit&quot; which basically is a hardware famiclone that uses socketed chips for the CPU/PPU e.t.c which we have chosen the good old UMC Chipsets for. <br /><br />We also sell brand new AV-mod kits, which you can see in our shop. Very affordable and very easy to install. Minimal soldering required and perfect for DIY projects.<br /><br />We will be selling these boards for a rather low price, and since we are the only one to our knowledge of even having a product like this, we are proud to present it to you here at NesDev.com as we know that you are all into the hardware-stuff. <br /><br />Anyway, the link to our shop is following:<br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.aliexpress.com/store/138988">http://www.aliexpress.com/store/138988</a><!-- m --><br /><br />Note that CHINESE NEW YEAR is coming up which means that we have to halt the orders and we will not be able to accept new orders until the 26th February since the whole country is basically shutting down for the new years celebrations. Please understand that this is not our fault, but sorry for any inconvinience.<br /><br />Anyway. You are more than welcome here to ask questions about our products in this thread and i hope that is okay. I personally am a huge gamer and the reason i started to make these boards were because of personal use since i love retro gaming and the Famicom in particular.  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />
