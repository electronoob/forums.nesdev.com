There's only so much you can do here, though.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />In the Super NES, the DSP converts 4-bit samples to 16-bit using several layers of volume scaling and filtering and then mixes up to 8 of them. Because the hardware is fixed function, it can mix at consistently high quality at 32 kHz.<br /><br />In the Game Boy Advance, the hardware plays the pair of 8-bit streams it's given. Because the same CPU has to both run the game and mix the audio, games tend to cheap out on high-quality mixing in favor of good enough unfiltered fast mixing, and they often end up with 18 kHz.<br /><br />Do &quot;Gravis Ultrasound&quot; and &quot;Sound Blaster&quot; have any meaning to you? If so, I can explain using an analogy.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />In my opinion, a lot of games probably would have used higher-quality audio if GBA game storage had been bigger and cheaper back in the early 2000s. That is to say, it's not necessarily CPU-time constraints that are an issue, just available ROM space. I believe tepples pointed out some GBA games that stream music directly from ROM using DMA. I wouldn't be surprised if some of the GBA Video carts do that too. With DMA, you can more or less set-and-forget until you need to re-loop music or something else. I believe I did some rough calculations last year, and if you went with the default waitstates (set by the GBA BIOS), you could stream 1 channel of 32KHz audio with about ~20% CPU usage (I don't remember the exact amount, but it's in that range).<br /><br />But, like I said, storage space is a big issue going through this route. A minute of uncompressed audio at 32KHz takes up ~1.83MB if my math is correct. The GBA was designed to accept ROMs of up to 32MB, so going any higher requires specialized carts with ROM-banking abilities. I think only one commercial cartridge actually did that, Shrek 2 (the GBA Video, not the game). I think it's a 64MB cart that sends banking commands by writing to certain addresses (much like the MBCs on the DMG and GBC).<br /><br />So, in theory, you could make your own customized flashcart with banking commands to access any amount of storage you want. Think MSU-1, but on the GBA, and if can take that 20% hit in CPU-time (which is not bad, honestly), you could get some rather impressive audio squeezed onto the GBA. Some caveats would be if you want 2 channels of 32KHz audio, well, that's going to bite a lot out of the CPU. Ideally, 1 channel could be dedicated to BG music or whatever, and the second channel could do SFX whenever needed (at a lower quality possibly), or just ignore the 2nd DMA sound channel and use the GBA's PSG channels for &quot;8-bit&quot; SFX. You'd also be limited to mono audio with 1 DMA sound channel, but I'm not sure how much that's really a concern.
