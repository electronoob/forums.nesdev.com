		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Hello!<br />I'd like to announce a new NES homebrew project. It's a puzzle game called <em>Lucky Penguin</em>.<br /><br /><img src="http://i5.photobucket.com/albums/y191/macbee/PN01_zps3ikw7q0b.png" alt="Image" /><img src="http://i5.photobucket.com/albums/y191/macbee/PN04_zpsjddabbwm.png" alt="Image" /><br /><br />Lukasz Kur (from recent Oliver Twins NES releases) is the programmer and I'm doing the graphics.<br />My favorite thing about the visuals is that I'm using flickering on backgrounds (to create illusion of more shades/colors on screen). But you can turn off this effect in case you want a traditional NES look.<br /><br /><strong>Flicker ON vs. Flicker OFF:</strong><br /><img src="http://i5.photobucket.com/albums/y191/macbee/PN02_zpsrg3fkkyh.png" alt="Image" /><img src="http://i5.photobucket.com/albums/y191/macbee/PN03_zpso1jm8zsk.png" alt="Image" /><br /><br />I think that all graphics and sounds are already finished. But there's still things to be tested/adjusted related to programming. All screenshots are still WIP - but I think they're already very close to their final version. Feel free to ask any questions about this project. Hope you like it!

Every flicker demo I have tried on my different consoles and TVs has looked like total fail. At least you're offering the option to turn the effect off, so this may not be such a big deal.<br /><br />Another thing you should keep an eye out for is how close to the edges of the screen some of the text is... You have text way outside the safe area indicated by Nintendo back in the day, so you may want to rethink some screen layouts or at least make sure that any parts that may be cut won't interfere with the gameplay.<br /><br />Other than that, the game looks pretty good! I really like the overall aesthetics!

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Yeah, when it's a toggle option, i think anything goes - it's great for those who can display it.<br /><br />But generally, i think subtler switching is the key, e.g. one, two or a few colours in a selected area and circumstance, like some edges or highlights. Changing hue is easier on the eye than changing brightness. In the latter case, if you can provide a material reason for the varyingly visible flicker (striplight or candle light), it's better.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I need to take some time to try and see how many levels I can beat.<br />To those wondering about the flicker: on my CRT it looks really subtle. Doesn't bother me at all (NTSC). Especially with the technique used with similar colors blended (it isn't flickering red+green pixels for example). I think my tv is super sharp for NES standards, but of course it could be sharper with component cables. Maybe then the flicker would be slightly more noticeable. On a blurrier tv 99% of players wouldn't even know it is flickering (it's hard to notice on my TV if you're not looking for it).<br />Anyway, in the end, I'm all for using techniques such as these on complete new games for the NES. I think they did an amazing work! What great novelty games could be made if only people opened their minds <img src="./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" />

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Played through! I liked it. Very polished. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /> <br /><br />Here's some thoughts, if you're interested in opinions:<br /><br />Difficulty: I like that the difficulty shifts significantly with level style and music. This is the proper place to do so, IMO. <br /><br />Score: The bonus for getting two clovers within a second(?) is a good way to differentiate scores between playthroughs (besides the time bonus). I kind of feel that the time bonus is a bit overshadowed by the massive amount of points you get for clovers, maybe 500 (and 750 when getting one fast) would balance better against time? But if you're fine with the current balance, that's good too. <br /><br />Complexity: Will additional mechanics be introduced along the way? Depending on how many worlds the total game will be, new mechanics can help maintain interest, beside increasing challenge. <br /><br />Sound: It's hard to judge this without a regular tv to plug into, but the pulse (and maybe also noise) channels felt a bit loud? I often find it more relaxing to the ears tone them down a bit relative to the tri wave, which is often used for bass duties - bass frequencies take more energy/pressure to be percieved as 'loud' than hi-mid frequencies, and conversely, the ear is more sensitive to mid-high tones and sounds. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equal-loudness_contour" class="postlink">Wikipedia article</a> on the subject.<br /><br />Style: Everything looks adorable! The smooth animation of the character goes well in hand with the &quot;extra&quot; colours. <br /><br />One thing stood out as slightly less polished than the rest and just perhaps a little bit outside the stylistic direction: the red cross sprite used for showing that flicker is off.  Three things on top of my head you could do: a) A black, dark gray or dark blue/teal drop shadow could help a lot. b) and since you know the exact position of the sprite, you can also soften some jagged edges with another colour between the red and the main bg colour. c) To make it more consistent with the theme, you could swap red for pink (the one you use in the checkerboard) altogether. <br /><br />Semantics: More a question than an opinion. Is flicker the best word to describe to a non-technical gamer what the feature is?
