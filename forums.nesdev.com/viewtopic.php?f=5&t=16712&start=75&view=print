		<br />
	</div><br />So, how do you put a Famicom game on top?<br />This only works if you turn around the converter by 180 degrees because of the attachments on the side or if the Famicom game doesn't have a shell by itself, as in the image.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Most converters require the famicom front label to be facing down in the NES cartridge tray as you've mentioned.  To keep the famicom label up you need a converter which 'flips' all the connections like I did with my design.<br /><br />I didn't realize the tabs on the side of the gyromite connector would need sawed off as well as the famicom shell would prevent seating of the cart as you've also pointed out..<br /><br />I imagine people who use it have to hack those tabs off, but then consequently can't easily attach it to an original case that's sawed in half.  So they just use the bare adapter without case?  Or they take the famicom board out of the case which is rather difficult to do without breaking the case tabs..?

Which means you cannot put a Famicom cartridge on top, you have to remove it from its shelf and use the Famicom board directly.<br />An issue that could have easily been fixed had they removed the upper edges of the board.<br /><br />What were they thinking with this kind of design?

I think it's mainly the AV Famicom that has low volume, and since it were released after the majority of the expansion audio games was made, games where probably made with the older Famicoms in mind. If I understand it correctly the potentiometer is not for simulating different Famicom systems, but for simulating different audio expansion cartridges since they may differ, and since the mixing has to be done in the console instead of in the cartridge in the NES' case.<br /><br />Yeah the Everdrive is pretty much useless for anything that uses expansion audio. The games that are &quot;supported&quot; are effectively unplayable on the Everdrive unless you play without sound.

They're all mixing on their own terms, and you're not going to get a good balance from anything unless you can make it adjustable instead.
