Though some users consider it rude to silently edit a post, it is also rude to a post's author to put him or her down for having made errors that need to be corrected, and public indications that a post has been edited might be misinterpreted as a passive-aggressive way of doing that. It may also be rude to readers to disrupt the flow of reading a conversation with detailed &quot;commit logs&quot; on each post, especially if it is not the first in a topic. (This is why Stack Overflow encourages users to suggest edits to other users' questions and answers and puts each post's revision history on a separate page, though phpBB does not support either feature.)<br /><br />I edited <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/viewtopic.php?p=171579#p171579" class="postlink">this post</a> to add attribution for the image. Some operators of websites consider it rude to hotlink for a couple reasons. One is possibly outdated perceptions of the cost of long-haul Internet bandwidth, which may have dropped dramatically in the years since someone first started to operate his first site. Another is that authors of photos and illustrations feel they deserve credit for having created those copyrighted images, and the law agrees with them (as codified in attribution laws such as <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/1202" class="postlink">17 USC 1202</a>). A fair use defense requires having acted in good faith, and I feel attribution is one of the elements of establishing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clean_hands" class="postlink">clean hands</a>.<br /><br />So when a site operator reads server logs and finds people hotlinking too often, he will try one of three things. One is to add a rule to the web server's configuration to produce a <tt style="margin-left: 2px; margin-right: 2px; padding:3px; background-color: #3355aa; color: white;">403 Forbidden</tt> status when the value of the <tt style="margin-left: 2px; margin-right: 2px; padding:3px; background-color: #3355aa; color: white;">Referer</tt> header isn't an approved site. The other is to replace the image with disturbing pornography, as <a href="http://ascii.textfiles.com/archives/1011" class="postlink">textfiles did to a bunch of MySpace users</a> (<strong>NSFW:</strong> Goatse). And even if the image is on a site that explicitly tolerates hotlinking, such as Imgur, the author could do a third thing: sue for infringement. So I silently edited in an attribution to deter the website from taking measures against hotlinking because at least the site has a possibility of getting visits out of the deal.<br /><br />After the complaint, I edited calima's post again to provide a notice that I had edited the post. I've put up a poll about what to do in the future, especially until such time as phpBB supports revision history for each post.

It is acceptable to make an edit to someone's post to resolve a matter of policy, abuse, violation of rules, etc. It is not acceptable to correct something you think is a spelling or logical or other mistake. If you think it needs to be corrected, mention it to them, either in the thread, or in PM if you want. It is up to them to correct themselves. DO NOT PUT YOUR OWN WORDS IN THEIR MOUTH, EVEN IF YOU THINK IT'S WHAT THEY MEANT. If they don't want to change it, or are absent, <em>leave it</em>. Again, don't put your words in someone else's mouth.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">tepples wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">It may also be rude to readers to disrupt the flow of reading a conversation with detailed &quot;commit logs&quot; on each post.</div><br />If you have made <em>ANY</em> edit to a post not your own I think it is very rude <em>NOT</em> to leave a note explaining it. If you make a non-trivial edit to your own posts, you should still mark it so that people who have already read the thread aren't confused when they come back.<br /><br /><br />All of this is also part of the reason I find thread splits very offensive. While you don't seem to change people's words when you do it, you certainly change the context of them, which does alter their meaning as well.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />While I'm not a mod any longer (by choice/unrelated to this subject), I will give my two cents (esp. given my background):<br /><br />Editing a users' post, no matter how positive the intentions (and I think everyone here would universally agree that tepples, you're a great guy and always have positive intentions!) is considered inappropriate, or bare minimum considered &quot;bad form&quot;.  Most people I know of <strong>would NOT</strong> be participating on a forum where this happens, even if done in good faith.<br /><br />There is no way I'd consider editing actual words/sentences of someone though (this includes &quot;attribution for fair use&quot;) -- if I had issues with it, I'd send them a PM asking if they could edit it themselves.  I believe I edited users post at one point to fix a URL that was wrong (I think it was a sticky?  I forget), but even doing that made me feel awkward.<br /><br />A person's words (including mistakes, bad decisions, etc.) are his/hers alone.  Positive or inflammatory, accurate or inaccurate, references provided or lack thereof, they need to remain *their* (unedited) words.  Anything else starts to breed a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministries_of_Nineteen_Eighty-Four#Role_in_information" class="postlink">Ministry of Truth</a> scenario, and the direct effect of this is that the community will bail (or riot).  For the moderators, the repercussions (even if their intentions were 100% positive 100% of the time) weigh heavily on the psyche.<br /><br />This isn't about transparency either -- transparency isn't needed when by not editing posts the entire issue become moot.<br /><br />Also, consider volatile situations (there has been an example lately, re: people showing up to bother psychopathicteen), where in situations like that possibly the thread content could become reference material in legal matters.  If mods have edited things (for whatever reason), this becomes precarious at best (expect a subpoena, etc.).<br /><br />My point is that the ramifications of editing people's posts go a lot deeper than one initially might think.  I don't want to sit around pontificating them for days -- I'm a person with high enough stress levels as is! -- but sometimes even the most innocuous good faith efforts can have dire consequences unconsidered at the time.

While doing so, I noticed that the checkbox &quot;Lock post [Prevent editing]&quot; below the edit was <em>unchecked.</em> If all edits by a moderator blocked further edits by the author, then why would there be a checkbox to do so? I'm seriously not understanding the mechanism through which this behavior happens.<br /><br />Do I need to leave for a while?

Same with incorrect information, a reply with the corrected information is preferred, since that's just normal discussion.<br /><br />Finally, all moderator edits need to be disclosed in the edited post, because the edits are not the user's intent, but winds up attributed to them anyway, which is always a bad thing everywhere.<br /><br />Edit: &quot;Things that go out of control&quot; can apply to rampant offtopic discussion in a thread, but a split (or other action) isn't really necessary unless the OP requests it, or several posters agree on it. It's only &quot;off topic&quot; when everyone agrees that it adds nothing to the discussion. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" />

It's also acceptable to reply to that reply criticizing them for being a <em>pedantic ass</em>. (There are, in fact, polite/tactful ways to correct someone's spelling subtly, too.

The purpose of moderators is to have a human evaluate when something has gone too far.

If it has gone too far, I'd prefer a locked thread to a split, as a lock preserves meaning, but that's me.<br /><br />Again, perfectly acceptable to post a &quot;stay on topic&quot; reply too, long before we reach an &quot;extreme case&quot;.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">koitsu wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">Editing a users' post, no matter how positive the intentions (and I think everyone here would universally agree that tepples, you're a great guy and always have positive intentions!) is considered inappropriate, or bare minimum considered &quot;bad form&quot;.

(Even when I'm not the author I find them confusing, though, as a reader, as they inhibit my ability to remember the course of the conversation.)<br /><br />If you think they're warranted, I'll abide by them, but I'll probably never agree that a thread split is a good idea. It never fails to disorient me, and I've posted to the wrong thread on many occasions because of it.<br /><br />I've complained about specific splits in the past, but every time I've done so it's because I had just suffered some kind of confusion because of it.
