<br />I guess the same with MTE could be as well compressed than huffmann (but the decoding table would be larger) and is much, much easyer to use.
<br />The problem of your DOS program isn't the usage, it doesn't run at all (when I type huffpuff, the DOS command answer "Not executable programm" or something like that).
<br />I consuled another book about structures and there also was an example with names, etc...
<br />So a structure/union is a kind of buffer in the C language, but your assempler seems to do a mix between C and ASM and it's not easy to got it. If I'm unable to find a better doccumentation about it I may switch to another assemler for my project. (I tried it a lot, but a lot of stuff are frutrating for me).
<br />Also, annonymous macros doesn't work at all, and I've done them exactly as in the exmple (the like i=0 render an error)

<br />Strange. I just assembled both examples without problem. Are you using the latest version of the assembler (1.4.5)? Could you give the precise error message?
<br />
<br />Concerning the debugging-related problems of data/code relocation. If you give the --verbose option to the linker, it will print out the final physical address of each public symbol in your code, which should be of some help. But again, you can just use .EQU directives to map your RAM to avoid the automapping altogether.

<br />Well, I had never noticed before, but now that you said it... I just had to check! =)
<br />It really seems to behave like this... maybe he checks if the player is in the air based on the vertical velocity... wich will result in fake information at that exact point right beforte the player begins to descend.
<br />
<br />The 1st platformer I programmed had that same (d)effect. I guess you gotta have a flag to tell if the player is in the air or not... checking the velocity is just not an accurate way to do it...
<br />
<br />So, I guess that if you keep doing it at the right times you could go up to the ceiling, right? =)

<br />You probably already have to have one, scince your player most probably don't have that same animation frame in air than on the ground. So a such flag is needed when checking witch animation frame should be used to draw the player.
