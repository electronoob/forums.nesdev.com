Yep, looks like it's only Store and Read-Modify-Write instructions that don't take extra cycles when the page crosses after adding Y or X to an absolute or indirect address.<br /><br />I think the read instructions can get away with a dummy read on an uncorrected address, and replace it with a real read for when it needs to correct the page.  But the write instruction always has to wait, so it waits that extra cycle to make sure it has a corrected address.<br />I guess the read-modify-write instructions are just designed to always wait 1 cycle to correct the address after the dummy read.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=53">Dwedit</a> — Fri Aug 26, 2011 2:12 pm</p><hr />

I have been trying to figure out an implicit, reliable, and smart way to check for page crossing when executing certain addressing modes. I came up with the following for Indirect,Y..<br /><br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">if &#40;code != 0x91 &amp;&amp; &#40;code &amp; 0x1F&#41; == 0x11&#41; &#123;<br />    // Check for page boundary on Indirect,Y addressing mode<br />&#125;</div><br /><br />It's reliable, but explicit and could cause unnecessary slow-downs having to check each instruction that uses Indirect,Y (Albeit, not many do).<br /><br />I started researching this more, and came up with an assumption that I would like verified or proven wrong. My assumption based on research is that only instructions that read and ONLY read an effective address add cycles for page crossing. Read-modify-write instructions don't seem to check for page boundaries, and neither do instructions that only write to the effective address. For example:<br /><br />ADC<br />AND<br />CMP<br />EOR<br />LDA<br />LDX<br />LDY<br />ORA<br />SBC<br /><br />Those instructions never modify any data in RAM, they only modify internal registers. They also check page boundaries.. Is my assumption correct, or is there a better explanation?<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=4320">beannaich</a> — Fri Aug 26, 2011 11:19 am</p><hr />
