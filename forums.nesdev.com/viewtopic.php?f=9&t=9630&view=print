However, due to recent research, I learned it has the problem of reversed duty cycle so the music in the games doesn't sound 100% accurate. So, I obtained an NES board, took its CPU/PPU and put them in the famiclone (got the idea from here: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://133fsb.wordpress.com/2009/11/28/restoring-a-nice-famiclone-part-2/">http://133fsb.wordpress.com/2009/11/28/ ... ne-part-2/</a><!-- m -->). It was easy because the famiclone doesn't have its CPU/PPU soldered to the board, instead it uses some nice sockets for the chips. Here's a picture of the famiclone board (with its original chips):<br /><a href="http://gapf.ninth.su/family2.jpg" class="postlink"><img src="http://gapf.ninth.su/family2tn.jpg" alt="Image" /></a><br />Now the problem: the famiclone won't work with the NES chips. Doing some tests I noticed these combinations work/fail:<br /><br />original famiclone CPU + original famiclone PPU = it works<br />original famiclone CPU + NES PPU = it works<br />NES CPU + original famiclone PPU = it doesn't work<br />NES CPU + NES PPU = it doesn't work<br /><br />so this seems to mean the NES CPU is not working. When I say &quot;not working&quot;, it means that when turned on the famiclone will show a purple screen and nothing else. Resetting it has no effect at all, not even a blink on the screen.<br /><br />My questions are:<br />- Is there a way to test if the CPU is effectively dead, or if it's maybe some incompatibility with my famiclone? I have a voltmeter and know how to use it, but not much else (no oscilloscope for instance).<br />- If the CPU is dead: can somebody please sell me a working NES CPU? I will gladly pay for it. Please keep in mind that I'm in Latin America.<br /><br />Thanks!!

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Hi!<br /><br />You are right, rainwarrior. However, from what I have read, the old famiclones (this one is from the early 90's) are usually chip-by-chip copies of the original family computer (even the chips layout looks almost identical to the original family computer), so that (and the link I posted earlier) got me thinking into the possibility of using the NES CPU/PPU to power it. Also, the PPU seems to be compatible, so I guess there is a chance that the CPU is also compatible. That's why I need to know if the CPU I have is fine (which means my famiclone is not compatible with it) or is damaged (which tells me nothing about the famiclone compatibility).<br /><br />Thanks!

The reason I prefer destorying an NES board to fix the famiclone over having an original NES is actually four reasons: <br />1. The famiclone is what I grew up with, an NES means nothing to me (it doesn't have that sentimental value) even if the games look/are the same. <br />2. It's cheaper to find a broken NES board and get the chip than buying a complete NES (which I would have to buy in the US and import it, since Nintendo never sold NES in Latin America. The NES is a really rare thing where I live.) <br />3. The 60-pin connector in the famiclone seems more robust than the 72-pin ZIF from the NES, besides I have the converter to use NES games in the famiclone.<br />4. The famiclone can use the extra audio sound chips in the japanese games (Akumajou Densetsu for instance), whereas the NES doesn't unless you modify it (which requires skills a bit over me).<br /><br />The desoldering process wasn't done by me (as I've told, I don't have those skills). It was done by a &quot;professional&quot; who obviously is not as skilled as I thought.<br /><br />Therefore, that's why I'm looking for an original CPU for my famiclone <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />Thanks!

If this is something you want this badly your best bet is honestly to not avoid your most reasonable options because &quot;you lack skills&quot;.  If nothing else since you're ditching the whole mobo you could test your desoldering skills on other smaller chips.  Although that leaves fewer debug options/tools.<br /><br />One reason I'm saying you're unlikely to find someone here who has a CPU to sell is because most of us aren't interested in sacrificing an entire working NES for it's CPU alone.  Honestly I have one I could sell you if I really wanted to, but this isn't a worth 'use' for the one spare CPU/mobo I have unless you were offering an unreasonable amount.<br /><br />I'm not trying to be a jerk, just trying to motivate you to take on your project including acquiring any needed skills.  It's obvious your passionate about getting this thing to work, so it seems reasonable that you'd be willing to learn a simple task to accomplish your goal.

You won't damage the part if you don't do anything really dumb. <br /><br />I have a NES console that appears to have a dead CPU and a live PPU. If I have spare chips I'd consider trying to sort that out, but since you can't really just get loose CPUs and PPUs there just isn't anything that can be done. Shouldn't the US and Japan consoles have the same CPU and PPU chips? You could possible source a good CPU from a messed up Famicom maybe.
