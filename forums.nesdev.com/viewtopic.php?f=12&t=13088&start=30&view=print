The SNES has the the resistor from the reset line that comes out of PPU2 that holdes the CPU, RAM and sound module in reset disconnected (I think it is R72 or R74).  I can trigger off the sysck line and I think I can trigger off a data pattern but I will need to read my LA manual to figure out how to do it.  I will loose the CPURD and CPUWR signals by doing this though (trigger off SYSCK).  The LA is a HP 1661C if you are wondering.  I will try to convert the tif files to jpeg in the future.  Sorry about that. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" alt=":(" title="Sad" />  It also looks like the SNES is trying to enable the display but ends up turning it off as well as trying to initialize the sound module.

Don't feel bad about it.<br /><br />---<br /><br />Anyway, if I compare what the LA trace is doing to what the game &quot;ought&quot; to be doing (according to NO$SNS's debugger), I actually see some useful things:<br />At $00866D, SMAS has the following code:<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">sta $2181<br />sty $2183<br />lda #$8000<br />sta $4300<br />lda $02<br />sta $4302<br />ldy $04<br />sty $4304<br />lda $00<br />sta $4305<br />ldy #1<br />sty $420B<br /></div>In the debugger, when this routine is first called, the first five bytes of memory are $00 $04 $00 $FC $07—it should be trying to transfer $0400 bytes from address $07FC00, and instead it's getting open-bus values.<br /><br />Oh, right. You said you disabled the RAM. Well, it definitely shows that.

It's not 50/50 duty; slow cycles seem to have it high longer while CPURD is low longer. This confirms my suspicion about 3/5 ratios. There are also what appear to be a few very short pulses on SYSCK; what do those signify?<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">Poot36 wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">I will try to convert the tif files to jpeg in the future.</div><br />PNG would be far better.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Ok, I have converted the pictures to .png.  I have found out that triggering on SYSCK is a bad idea because you do end up loosing the CPURD, CPUWR, PARD, and PAWR lines and sometimes the LA will stop capturing if it does not see a clock for a predetermined time.  I have captured a trace by leaving the SNES running but just re-triggering the LA.  The RAM chip is still being reset, all I have done is prevented the PPU2 chip from holding it (and the CPU and Sound Module) in reset by disconnecting R74 in the schematic.  This is the /RESOUT1 line.  The CPU still pulls this reset line high.

Is there a off the shelf RAM chip that I could try replacing it with?

For all I know, SMAS could just start executing random crud if any peripheral isn't working.<br /><br />(e.g. There's the known bug in the revision 1 CPU's DMA controller (revision is indicated on top of the CPU package, 5A22-nn); if SMAS is writing specific wrong garbages to the DMA controller, because it expected valid values in RAM ... well, we don't actually know what that crash looks like, in an electrical sense.)<br /><br />Anyway, what's keeping you from making a test cart? Lack of PROMs? Lack of programmer? You're quite clearly already very good with a soldering iron...

It has two 720Kb floppy drives and has boot software from you will never believe this 2006 running on it!  It uses a serial port for communication and takes 5 minutes or so to start up off the floppy drive (old slow 10Mhz Motorola based processer I think).  I am still trying to find a cart to modify and I don't look forward to removing the existing rom chip without damaging it.  I think you are right that I am just making things more complicated then they need to be with a standard cart.  What cart should I be looking for to run the test programs that have been mentioned in previous posts?  I think it has to be a LoROM cart.

For reference, you can look at the pages on snescentral.com. <br /><br />Alternatively, if you have the ability to get a PCB made (such as a PCB mill), I have a very simple design that would accept a 128 to 512 KiB EEPROM like the SST39SF0x0 series. It's basically identical to the <a href="http://www.snescentral.com/pcbboards.php?chip=SHVC-1A0N-01" class="postlink">1A0N</a> and <a href="http://www.snescentral.com/pcbboards.php?chip=SHVC-1J0N-01" class="postlink">1JON</a> official PCBs.

A &quot;Jeopardy&quot; game cartridge I used for testing would actually load (briefly) on these consoles. Only for a few seconds, but the title screen would be visible.  No other cartridge I used would do this.  Not sure if this means anything. Just thought I would throw it out there.

I have attached a socket and have preformed the 2 pin swap but only connected the CS line due to my chip only having 2mb (256Kb) of space on it.  I have used the snesROMUtil to byte swap the .sfc file and programmed it to the chip however it is not working.  The flash chip is a AS29F2008-12 made by ASD and I can not find a datasheet for it and my programmer does not have it listed so I selected Winbond W29C020 in my programmer instead.  The cart is labled SHVC-1J1M-11 and has a MAD-1 chip on it.  Am I doing this wrong or do I need a 27c801 for this utility to work?  Is there a more compatible flash chip that I can select in my programmer?  The original ROM chip does have a small crack like blister showing on the package, is it possible that it damaged other chips on the board when it died?  Should I bypass the MAD-1 chip?

If you do do that, make sure you disable the RAM on the cart: the MAD-1 is basically a 74'139 (responsible for decoding RAM, or multiple ROMs) plus a battery backup protection circuit.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I think I figured out a few things.  First I meant OE not CS (was reading off the SNES schematic).  Second I think the &quot;J&quot; letter printed on the cart label means that it is a HiROM cart and all of the ROMs that I am using are LoROM.  Third the byte swap is so that I only have to change the positions of 2 pins of the EEPROM instead of 5 pins due to the nonstandard pin placement of the cart vs EEPROM.  After reading the extra note of the utility my roms are only 2mb so from what I gather I need to expand it to 8mb and then run it through the utility but could I then shrink it back to 2mb and have it still work is the big question?  Forth is there a way to convert the LoROM file to a HiROM one or will I have to modify the cart further?  Fifth I do have a working SNES and can confirm that the cart's CIC (lockout) chip is still functioning.  I have programed this chip before (but only as a 1mb chip by holding the last address line permanently low and selecting the W29C010 from the programers list) for a 486 motherboard and it worked but would sometimes give me errors I think due to the board been flaky or it somehow rewriteing the chip (it was designed for a UV EPROM).  I think the second problem is the root cause of this not working.  Oh well at least I am learning and no magic smoke has come out yet.

(i.e. ABCDEFGH becomes AABBCCDDEEFFGGHH).<br /><br /><br />It's probably easier if you find one of the various tiny SNES tests, like the pile of 32 KiB homebrew that have been made over the years... not that I can find an obvious listing of these.<br /><br />If nothing else, I took <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/viewtopic.php?p=151325#p151325" class="postlink">tepples's spadtest-0.01</a> and reassembled it to be eensy (just 8KiB). Duplicate it to fill your 'PROM.<br />The patch containing the source differences to make it 8KiB instead of 256KiB is included in the zip.
