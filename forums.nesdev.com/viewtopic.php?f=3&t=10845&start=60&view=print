The ROM code was hacked to prevent the world number from being initialized. Since this dump of the game does not initialize the world number, it is at the mercy of what that spot of memory is set to on power-up. Accurate emulators set RAM to 0xFF, which in equivalent to world 0, while inaccurate emulators (including RockNES) set RAM to 0x00, equivalent to world 1. (There are a few games that expect RAM to 0xFF at startup, or so I remember hearing, so an emulators really doesn't have much flexibility in this area.)&quot;<br /><br /><br />this was referenced here:  <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://forums.bannister.org/ubbthreads.php?ubb=showflat&amp;Number=22936">http://forums.bannister.org/ubbthreads. ... mber=22936</a><!-- m --><br /><br />So with that said, what games rely on 0XFF at startup? 0x00 is not accurate? 0xFF is? Whats the best way to handle this, have random numbers generate each time the emulated console is powered on?

If you want &quot;authentic&quot; hardware behaviour, yes probably some randomization is what you want, allowing users to hit power a billion times until a badly programmed game starts up in a state that works for them. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" /><br /><br />If you want <em>consistent</em> behaviour, either all 0s or all 1s is a good choice. You could even make it an option in the menu, if you like.<br /><br />I think most users were prefer consistent behaviour from an emulator, but I don't speak for everybody. I don't think I've seen an emulator that has the option for 0s or 1s, but it would be pretty useful for this kinda thing... (e.g. &quot;Want to play this Dendy pirate game that doesn't initialize RAM? Set it to 0.&quot;)<br /><br />Maybe I should think about adding such an option to FCEUX.

I have several friends who enjoy emulators that implement &quot;glitch tools&quot;, and one who streams his stuff on occasion (there are lots of people who like doing this though).  I think you might be surprised at the extent of which their tweaking goes; I believe they use either a) modified emulators that offer said features, or b) use tools that &quot;mangle&quot; ROM images in advance (obviously (b) is not applicable here).  Pre-initialising memory to random values (and even &quot;what type&quot; of randomness!) is certainly in that list.<br /><br />This is why I think, at least in the case of Nestopia, NstDatabase.xml would be suited for games which need &quot;different&quot; values set in RAM prior to running code out of the reset vector.  But as my comment in the pull request says: I simply don't know how to implement this in Nestopia given the complexity and &quot;mess&quot; of the code.

I wouldn't be surprised if there are other Dendy consoles which default to &quot;mostly $FF&quot;.  In other words: I don't see how the Dendy is any different than the NES/Famicom in this regard.

That type of behaviour has already proven itself useful in the SNES homebrew community with higan/bsnes, where on at least 1 occasion it helped a developer track down a bug in their code (it either worked right on a physical console but not in higan/bsnes, or vice-versa; the person's code didn't pre-initialise some variables or registers (I forget which)).  rainwarrior considering implementing this in FCEUX (as a toggleable runtime feature) I think is worthwhile.

(You can still press A+Start to start in 1-1).<br />The real game doesn't care about uninitialized memory, although it does check for values in RAM to see if it has already booted or not.
