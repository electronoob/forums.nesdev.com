If not, I can host them on mesen.ca, but it might be best if they were hosted somewhere on nesdev.com.  <br />Or actually, maybe adding them to a github repository would be best? (Like Nesicide did - that was a great way to get my hands on most of the tests originally)  This would need to be a repository that several NesDev people have access to, though.

It is intended for source code.  Yes, some things that involve binaries (ex. images, etc.) are permitted, but the GitHub folks get quite upset if you make repositories exclusively for binaries and nothing else.  (I know this first-hand from my previous job, where GitHub got quite pissed at us for sticking nothing but binaries up in a repository.  Admittedly it was a very large amount of data, but they were very clear in their complaint/message)<br /><br />The other downside to GitHub is that whoever owns the repo is ultimately responsible for maintenance of it all.  I'm stating the obvious, I know, but the point with the Wiki is that it's a collaborative tool -- someone else later on with an account could upload a new fix/binary/zip and change the links -- while unless you're giving all the nesdev people access to said GitHub repo, that kinda defeats the purpose.

GitHub does offer an easy way to download everything easily + view the source code online, while the Wiki keeps everything in 1 place.<br /><br />I'm fine either way, both solutions would work and have up &amp; down sides - just need to decide which we want.

If you made a thread about a test ROM you wrote, it's pretty good cause you get the documentation and discussion all in the same place. You can also update it if needed.<br /><br />I don't see why you'd want to put any of it on github. If you want to collaboratively work on something specific with people I could understand starting a test suite project there, but I don't see the point in using it to collect a mishmash of ROMs written by various unrelated people at unrelated times for various purposes. (Not to mention whether any of the original authors would object-- I certainly wouldn't like to see any of the test ROMs I've posted on this forum treated that way.)

The SNES mouse test linked on the current wiki page is a dead link, though, and I do not know of anywhere else to download it (I don't have it either), so the test has no download link.<br /><br />I also added links to the forum threads containing the tests when one exists (I am sure I missed a few/lot of them, though).<br /><br />If this looks fine to everyone, I'll replace the <a href="http://wiki.nesdev.com/w/index.php/Emulator_tests#Validation_ROMs" class="postlink">Emulator Tests - Validation ROMs</a> part of the wiki with this.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />@Sour -- Looks awesome!  Recommendations:<br /><br />1. Rename &quot;Forum&quot; column to &quot;References&quot; or &quot;Resources&quot; (your choice).  I'd also suggest changing the word &quot;link&quot; to something more description, e.g. &quot;nesdev forum&quot;; there will certainly be cases where people will want to put more than one Reference/Resource in that field.<br /><br />2. I wish the Author field had been placed before the description (e.g. Name, Author, Description, References).  Changing this is painful (a lot of editing) -- trust me, I know.  So you can dismiss this one given the amount of work you did, but I just happen to think Author should come after Name.<br /><br />3. Please use <tt style="margin-left: 2px; margin-right: 2px; padding:3px; background-color: #3355aa; color: white;">class=&quot;wikitable sortable&quot;</tt> so that the columns can be sorted individually.  Many people would want only the ROMs by blargg to be shown at the top, etc...
