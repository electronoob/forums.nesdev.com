<br />
<br />The lot is not all unique games and the condition cannot be guaranteed.  I would not pay that much for this.  The list is made in a way that it's very hard to visualize how many unique games are inside, like it it was made that way on purpose. Who needs to know that the game is in box X? .. A clean list of titles would have been better.

<br />(They had allot of duplicates) And a few NESs
<br />
<br />The reason they don't have them anymore isn't 'cause they sold them, their house burned down recently, which must suck because they put  well over 100,000 dollars into the house a few years back for remodeling.
<br />And of course it's where they lived(And they didn't have good insurance)

<br />Amen to that.
<br />
<br />I have been thinking about selling my IBM PCjr. It's just collecting dust. But it's still it's original color, Has a Hotshotjrii so it's 640k of ram rather then 128k, and the display has no burn in. Plus It still has the original infrared keyboard.
<br />
<br />I just don't use it and I wanna sell it to someone who does wanna use it.

<br />Because a lot of people have different definitions of "handling it". One might want to start a used movie/game store.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />It depends on the mean of handling it.  I don't really buy duplicates just for the fun of it and to reduce them from the one available on the market  like the post you mentioned if my memory is good. I read that thread long time ago so I hope I'm not mixing things up!   I just bought a few recently but on purpose: extra dev carts when the price was very, very low. Who would skip a 2$ FF3 or 1$ Madara, even with very dirty adaptor?
<br />
<br />The nes is maybe the only one that I bought more games than usual since it was the one I liked the most.  I should have never sold my US games, that would have save me time and money I guess <img src="./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" /> 
<br />
<br />Sometime I bought game that I would almost not play because the price was low (0.50$ or 1$) because I don't mind to do that for that platform. But now I try to stick to the one I liked, less junk for nothing.  Now my only problem is some games never came to japan (that's feel odd to say that since usually it was the opposite in the past!) even thought they were made here (Kick master, low g man etc).  I may buy them again if I can find them cheap. It's rare that I want to put a lot of money on a old game, unless I really want it but I hate that.  
<br />
<br />For example, I found some megadrive (genesis) games at 2$/3$. One of them was YuYu hakusho. I thought it was the RPG and was "well, I like the TV series so why not". When I arrived home, it was actually the fighting game which is worth a lot more than that.  That was a happy find. After playing the game... I would have never paid the price some store ask, never. Why pay 70$/100$... That's crazy.  The best thing to wait, you never know when you can find it cheaper.  And now that auction at 3000$.... That's utter craziness for the current state of the lot.  I'm a gamer and would never pay that much. Even if I was a collector, the state is not good enough to worth that price. Ebay is where people pay too much for things that worth nothing. That's why I never use it.

I had to pay a considerable amount of cash to get MMC5 games for example, but I wanted them badly. It's ridiculous how expensive you see bad NES games can sell, for example I can't see Zelda II under $50, altough the game is considered bad by most people (okay Zelda is a well known game, but I just saw a guy hoping to sell Steath ATF (which is a very common cart and a very bad game for $50).
<br />
<br />That's too bad I'd like to make myself a SKROM devcart and I don't know of any other SKROM game released in PAL territories, altough maybe I'll find it cheap one day.

That's a rip off.  When I was not in japan, I never paid that much for a game used, ever. The only time I may have paid close to that was because it was new in a shop, that's it.  I was lucky to find Mega man 6, Star tropic II and Castlevania 3 new.  In that case, it was worth it. Even gamepad, final fantasy... How many years ago, I don't remember. Maybe late 90, beginning of 2000.

<br />What is the particularity of SKROM?  I don't know about this board, hmmm.. Now I just checked the wiki.  Baseball star is skrom.  If you don't mind that the japanese one I can send you one. Like I said, baseball game are everywhere in japan and this one is worth nothing compare to the state.  I have seen I don't know how many time between 1$/ 0.50$.

For disk I agree it's better new because when you use a disc, even the most correctly, it still becomes dirty. And the trouble you can have to make NES games boot have hardly anything do with dirt, some games are hard to boot no matter how much I clean them.

<br />No real particulatiry, exept that you can also run all MMC1 games with CHR-ROM on it (unless they relies on stupid mirroring/open bus behavior), and I may create games using this mapper in the future. Altough there is really no emergency, it would be in several years at best anyways. I don't know how accurate MMC emulation is on the Power Pak.
