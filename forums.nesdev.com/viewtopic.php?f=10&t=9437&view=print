NESASM helps you a little bit with the iNES header (which you can build just as easily with a handful of .db statements in any other assembler), but that's it. And it has that stupid 8KB bank setup, which has nothing to do with the NES unless you're using certain mappers.<br /><br />My honest opinion is that CA65 is the most professional and capable 6502 assembler, but it's hard to setup if you don't have a lot of experience with assemblers and compilers. Personally, I don't have the patience to learn how to use it. ASM6 is great for beginners, because it can instantly make an .NES file out of an .ASM file directly without complications.<br /><br />NEASM is just as simple as ASM6 to use, but the main problem is that it uses non-standard syntax for some types of instructions (zero-page addressing, indirection, high/low byte selection...). In the past it also had some really annoying bugs, which resulted in lack of error reports and corrupt binaries (i.e. it would assemble bad code and wouldn't tell you that anything went wrong), which made it really hard for people to locate bugs in their code. I think those serious problems are solved now. Most NES programming tutorials use NESASM, and since it uses different syntax it's hard to get beginners to use anything else.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I love ca65. Yes, there's a little bit of overhead to learn that you don't with NESASM (e.g. putting together an iNES header, setting up a .cfg file) but the power you get in return is well worth it, in my opinion.<br /><br />Not to mention that it comes with cc65, which is actually a real pain to set up, but now that I have it going full speed, it's just fantastic to be able to write C code instead of only assembly. Shiru has written a nice guide to this, and in the near future I plan to release some example source, myself. (I wrote my Famicompo entry this year mostly in C, which saved me a ton of time. I can't release it until voting is over though.)

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I was just reading on Wikipedia about the 6502, and came across the screenshot of Terminator, where 6502 ASM code flashes across the Terminator's Vision.<br />It's a 1984 movie, and standard 6502 code looks exactly the same now as it did then, right down to the &gt; and &lt; operator to take the high and low byte of a 16-bit word.<br />But the code shown on the screen in Terminator wouldn't create identical output in NESASM as it would in any other assembler.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I don't like the NESASM way to use zero-page addressing, but at least it's optional. ASM6, AFAIK, always uses zero-page instructions when accessing memory at $0000-$00FF. This bothers me a bit when I'm coding Atari 2600 programs, which often need precisely timed code to render the screen. Without a way to force absolute addressing, I must either write instructions with .db statements or use a mirror of $0000-$00FF instead.
