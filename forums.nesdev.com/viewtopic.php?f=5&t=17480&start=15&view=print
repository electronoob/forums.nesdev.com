It's even more frustrating that youtuber John Riggs mirrored their marketing at the very start of his review: &quot;Is it just another homebrew, or is it worth the three years' wait to play this game?&quot;  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_cry.gif" alt=":cry:" title="Crying or Very sad" /> He then goes on to state he's a huge fan of homebrew, so i guess that evens it a little. But it is still a wierd opening line to me. <br /><br />edit: he mentions it is lincensed. i guess Syndey hunter is a license? But it kind of comes of as if this was a licensed SNES game?<br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjMJZbLpVcE">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjMJZbLpVcE</a><!-- m --><br /><br />Honestly, most of the games i think are worth playing today are precisely homebrews. Just because there's a D.I.Y spirit in a lot of it and that the quality range is very wide, naturally doesn't mean it's all crap. But i'm preaching to the choir here.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />For the purposes of this reply, define &quot;homebrew&quot; as hobbyist games for a platform as well as commercial games published after the conclusion of a platform's commercial era, and &quot;mainstream&quot; as commercial games published during its commercial era. So even if you follow Theodore Sturgeon's recommendation to judge based on the 90th percentile in quality, the 90th percentile of homebrew games is lower than the 90th percentile of mainstream games.

One is &quot;approved by the console maker&quot;, which covers (for example) everything in Apple App Store, PlayStation Store, Nintendo eShop, etc. The other is &quot;using a well-known product identity subject to exclusive rights&quot;. All four combinations are attested in the pre-1997 NES library:<br /><br /><ul><li><em>The Terminator</em> is licensed (by Nintendo) and licensed (by Hemdale, owner of copyright in the film <em>The Terminator</em>).</li><li><em>Journey to Silius</em> is licensed (by Nintendo) but not licensed (by Hemdale, who chose LJN instead, forcing Sunsoft to create an original product identity instead).</li><li><em>Road Runner</em> is unlicensed (by Nintendo) but licensed (by Warner Bros. Pictures, as it's an adaptation of Looney Tunes short films).</li><li><em>Bible Adventures</em> is unlicensed (by Nintendo) and unlicensed (<em>The Bible</em> is old enough that its copyright has expired, as has copyright in early modern English translations).</li></ul>

I.e if your game is good enough and quality, why isn't it being published by a publisher?  Homebrew is a tier below Indie games.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />So, (edit - insert: according to those who hold the view that indie isn’t real) a ”real” game needs to have the actual content creators being alienated from their work to some degree?  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=":wink:" title="Wink" />  And broad strokes decided by sales experts? That’s kind of contrary to the game landscape i grew up in as a kid, with sid meiers civilization, commander keen, and diablo. These were all largely successful pc games where the creative direction still resided within the content creating team. Or going further, some of my best game experiences where in the mac shareware scene, completely indie/no publisher.<br /><br />A lot of good music has been record label-less. Today, it’s even hard to find good music on the major outlets. It’s all made for one cardinal purpose. If something is good, it has become almost accidental.

Like, if a hack author of a very popular licensed game was angry that a repro maker was selling copies of his game. He would have, probably, no legal recourse for stopping that.<br /><br />Or, if it LESS bad to hack an unlicensed game that was an illegal clone of a real licensed game. Like, I can't think of an example. Never mind.

Sure!<br />But I think there's enough great homebrew games to simply disallow this kind of generalisation.<br />This case is even a lack of knowledge about homebrews or simply another case of ingratitude.
