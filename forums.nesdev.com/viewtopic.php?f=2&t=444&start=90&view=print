<br />At least one popular RLE compression format uses <em>signed</em> numbers: 0 through 127 for a string of 1 to 128 literal bytes, or -1 through -127 for a run of 2 through 128 copies of the following byte. This format, introduced by Apple Computer with the MacPaint file format, is called PackBits. I've written a PackBits compressor (in C) and a decompressor (in 6502 assembly language) as part of <a href="http://www.pineight.com/pc/#ted" class="postlink">Pin Eight NES Tools</a>.

Which means you'll need areas in RAM for other information (like current source and dest positions, remaining bytes to be decompressed, etc)
<br />
<br />But I'm kinda just blowing smoke at you.
<br />
<br />I'm kind of in agreement with blargg on this one.  It looks like you're trying to move too far too fast.  Before you start doing things like compression you should really get more familiar with the basics.

If what you mean by basics is Sprite moving, Sprite DMA, joypad handling, vblank, etc., I pretty much have that all down. I'm thinking loading a background is pretty basic. Maybe I'll just start making one screen backgrounds with NSA. It's just that it always screws up on emulators, and shows name table 1.5. But no one else seems to have this problem, so maybe it's just my code. Any one know a decent way to load a .nam file?

<br />
<br />Actually, "loading a .NAM file" <strong>does</strong> work just fine on most emulators, AS LONG AS you do the other necessary stuff (i.e. turn off rendering while writing, set the VRAM address to the correct value, reset the origin/scroll parameters when you're done, and re-enable rendering at the end).

<br />
<br />That could be why it looks like it scrolled (it didn't scroll, but rather started it's display at the wrong origin).  I used to see that all the time in my programs, but it was temporary (since NMI would fix it on the next frame).  Now I get around that by waiting for a vblank before enabling the screen.

Because I was putting together a quick demo, and I tried to take the high and low bytes of the adress that the 8th nam file was at, and it completely screwed up, and the name table was all messed up. But in my routine, I changed it from taking the high and low bytes of the 8th nam file, to taking the high and low bytes of the 7th nam file, and it worked just fine. If you switch the nam files around, it will always load the last one improperly. I'm thinking it has something to do with memory space. Any clue?

And my PRG banks are 16K, actually, now that I think about it, I don't know how I could be going over the limit. But just a rough idea, not really an educated guess, it may have something to do with memory mirroring like in RAM, but I have my nam files in PRG. I hope that's not a problem. Oh, and if I put my nam files right by the .org $8000 part, it says "Bank overflow! &lt;$1FFF!" And when I put them back on bottom, it doesn't say that. But, I don't have any segments where I org it at any different location, or change banks, so what's the deal? I don't get it.
