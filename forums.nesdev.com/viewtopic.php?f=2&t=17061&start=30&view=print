I think you're either going to need a quite long sinc FIR filter, a very high order IIR filter, or accepting some passband &amp; stop-band ripple. Even a 10th order discrete-time butterworth lowpass (-3dB at 4.2MHz) only gets down to -12dB at 4.5MHz. Sharper filters (chebyshev, elliptic) help a little, but there's going to be a lot of group delay during the transition band.

I don't think that's pertinent though, because it's too old.<br /><br />As for filters, most materials on that subject, on-line or in print, expect way too many things to be known by the reader, are gratuitously formalistic, at the same time offensively imprecise in terminology and prose, and generally are not suited for people who just want to skim trying to find what they need. Of course, I say that about pretty much any mathematical subject, so who am I to complain.

As such, it's inappropriate for analysis or filtering.<br /><br />It's implemented in terms of the Fourier transform, by taking the original input and duplicating it once to produce a symmetric input for analysis.

And even if there would be some reason for the short scanline: The <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://shmups.system11.org/viewtopic.php?f=6&amp;t=61285">https://shmups.system11.org/viewtopic.php?f=6&amp;t=61285</a><!-- m --> says that the short scanline is located right before the first visible scanline - which is really bad (to avoid jittering, it should be located after last visible line, so the TV has enough time could resync itself to hsync's).<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">psycopathicteen wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">If it was, they should've had a missing half cycle every frame instead, so that artifacts cancled out entirely.</div><br />No! That would highlight the artifacts (the artifacts would be always drawn at the same static locations in all frames, which would make the artifacts more visible). Probably Nintendo actually wanted to do right that - and (fortunately) considered it too difficult to implement &quot;half cycles&quot;.<br /><br />Here are some maths from everynes.htm on the color clock:<br /><br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">Clock Speeds<br />&nbsp; Type&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;NTSC&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;PAL&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Dendy<br />&nbsp; Master Clock (X1)&nbsp; 21.47727MHz&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 26.6017125MHz&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Like PAL<br />&nbsp; Color Clock&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 3.579545MHz=X1/6&nbsp; &nbsp;4.43361875MHz=X1/6&nbsp; Like PAL<br />&nbsp; Dot Clock&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 5.3693175MHz=X1/4&nbsp; 5.3203425MHz=X1/5&nbsp; &nbsp;Like PAL<br />&nbsp; CPU Clock&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 1.7897725MHz=X1/12 1.66260703MHz=X1/16 1.773448MHz=X1/15<br />&nbsp; Frame Rate&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;60.09914261Hz&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 50.00697891Hz&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Like PAL<br /><br />Modulator vs PPU Timings<br />&nbsp; Type&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;NTSC&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; PAL&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Dendy<br />&nbsp; Dots per Color Clk&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;1.5 (6/4)&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;1.2 (6/5)&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;1.2 (6/5)<br />&nbsp; Color Clks per Scanline&nbsp; &nbsp; 227.3333&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 284.1666<br />&nbsp; Color Clks per One Frame&nbsp; &nbsp;59561.33&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 88660.0<br />&nbsp; Color Clks per Other Frame 59560.66&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 88660.0<br />&nbsp; Color Clks per Two Frames&nbsp; 119122.0&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 177320.0</div><br />For PAL/NES they've successfully achieved perfect uglyness with exactly 88660.0 color clocks per frame.<br />For NTSC/NES it's 119122.0 color clocks per TWO frames, which appears better than PAL, without the shortscanline it would be 3x59561.33 = 178684.0 clocks per THREE frames, which might look even better (with slight flimmering, but nearly invisible artifacts, ie. picture quality about as good as on PSX consoles).<br /><br />As far as I know, one could disable the short scanline effect by disabling BG and OBJ (somewhere during vblank, and enable them when the first scanline gets drawn). I don't have a NTSC/NES console myself... but it might be interesting to patch some commercial/homebrew game to see if it looks better/worse with/without short scanlines (might be a bit difficult since NES doesn't have too much support for scanline IRQs, and stuff like Sprite0 Hit likewise won't work when having BG and OBJ disabled).
