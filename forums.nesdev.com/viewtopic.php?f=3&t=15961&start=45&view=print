PA10, PA11 are the inputs from the cartridge connector. $4101 D0 selects whether PA10 or PA11 is relayed to the JV001's CIRAM A10 output, effective once $8000-$FFFF is written to:<div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">28-pin&nbsp; 24-pin&nbsp; Function (normative)<br />------&nbsp; ------&nbsp; --------------------<br />24&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ?&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Input PA10&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <br />25&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ?&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Input PA11&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <br />26&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 22&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Output CIRAM A10<br />27&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ?&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;PPU R/W<br />28&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ?&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;GND<br /></div>We know from the Mapper 173 analysis that the 01-22000-400 IC also has a pin that is similarly affected by $4101 D0: Pin 22, so it is most likely the CIRAM A10 equivalent. The question then is which pins are the equivalent input PA10 and PA11 pins. Unfortunately, no known board actually uses that IC for mirroring control, so we cannot observe that directly. But:<ul><li>On the Mapper 173 board, Pin 22 is connected to CHR A14. To deterministically be a 0 or 1 depending on $4101 D0, the Input PA10 pin must be connected to Vcc, and the Input PA11 pin must be connected to GND (or vice-versa).</li><li>On the Mapper 036 board, Pin 22 is not connected to anything, but is reportedly always high but somewhat unstable depending on register values being written. This may be the result of a broken chip, as previously claimed, but I think it's the result of one of the two inputs being connected to Vcc, and the other floating but mostly picking up a high signal.</li></ul>On Mapper 173, GND is on Pins 8 and 19 and VCC is on Pins 5 and 7. On Mapper 036, VCC is also on Pins 5 and 7, GND is Pin 19, while Pin 8 is not connected. I would suspect then that Pin 7 is Input PA10 and Pin 8 is Input PA11. Which means that if both were connected to GND, then Pin 22 should deterministically go Low after all.<br /><br />After that, there are still three of the 24 pins with functions to distribute: Pins 4, 6 and 23. Of the JV001's functions, we still have PA13, CHR /OE, and PPU R/W. I'm not sure what the JV001 would need them for, but that's how they are connected on the Mapper 172 board.<br /><br />Please note that my designations of D0-D5 are from the chip's point of view. Because the Mapper 172 board connects the CPU bits in reverse order, D5 is D0, D4 is D1 and so on, and Mapper 036's CPU D4/D5 are the chip's D0/D1.

I suppose that the 74LS161 configuration is then used for prototypes and development, while the ASIC configuration for production. The 74LS161 configuration would then have its data bits indeed like Mapper 133, but at $8000-$FFFF instead of $4100.
