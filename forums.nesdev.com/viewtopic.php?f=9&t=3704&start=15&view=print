<br />
<br />And with my newer mainboard's LPT, it works half-assedly.  Usually dies halfway through any operation.

<br />A unidirectional signal booster, if such a thing exists, would instantly solve all problems.
<br />Anyone care to design one? it basically applies hysteresis to the voltages applied to the 'outgoing' signal from the computer to boost it to 5v.
<br />so:
<br />computer -&gt; 3.3v -&gt; booster -&gt; 5v -&gt; copynes
<br />copynes -&gt; 5v -&gt; booster (ignores this signal) -&gt; 5v -&gt; computer
<br />the ignoring signal part is especially important for the data pins, which can be inputs or outputs on either end.
<br />
<br />A CMOS 65C22 *might* have slightly better tolerance of low voltages than an NMOS one does, but is much harder to obtain.

<br />I used the Win32 client (Q's) and assigned parallel Port to LPT1 and Address to DC80(in client-&gt;options).  Worked like a charm.

However, the 8086 i used for the project had a fried LPT1 port with no LPT2 so my project tho the code was flawless and the robot i built was connected and constructed within specifications to the Fischer-Technique module, failed to operate. If i ever find my copy i made of that TSR again, i will gladly shared it with those that are interested. Wiring an LPT1 or LPT2 port incorrectly will likely fry the port from what I have read. You may already have a damaged port from past use or incompatible devices, especially for second hand hardware.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">Davr.org :: SNES :: joystick.txt wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">  The main problem with PC parallel ports is that they don't have +5V power<br />source on any of their pins. So, if you want a reliable source of power<br />for your pads, use either keyboard or joystick port, and make a pass-through<br />cable. You can also pull the power directly from the power supply (the red<br />wire is +5V).</div>
<br />
<br />oldskool parallel ports for rarer commodore/apple systems used either +5v or +5.5v supply i think on multiple pins 8 thru 11. however, i haven't been able to verify this difference via online document yet. so don't even attempt to draw power from those pins on such a system without verifying such info firsthand from a respectable and proven source of hardware documentation.
<br />
<br />my second paragraph in this reply, prolly isn't applicable to CopyNES. However, i decided to include it in my response anyhow.

<br />
<br />In most cases parallel ports don't have to output 5V in order to interface with "5V" devices since a logical high in TTL is 2-5V.

<br />
<br />I can see two options here:
<br />
<br /> - Use a 74lc244 to buffer the signals coming from the PC (3.3v will register a '1')
<br /> - Use funkier and newer logic level translation solutions. If you go this route you get bidirectional conversion without having to mess with a Direction pin. Check out maxim, texas instrument or analog devices site for this.
<br />
<br />edit: jargon, why must you always post bullshit?
