Another example of a popular computer without hardware sprites is the Amstrad CPC. A common solution used by games to implement free moving sprites was to use a low resolution screen mode with 16 colors, but instead of making use of all 16 colors they used 2 bits for the background and 2 for the sprites, so it was easy to manipulate them independently. The games looked pretty bad though (look at Ghouls 'n Ghosts, for example).<br /><br />But many other CPC games had sprites and scrolling without giving up on the number of colors, it was just harder to program, and involved a lot of bit masking.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=95">tokumaru</a> — Sat Nov 03, 2012 5:03 pm</p><hr />

Some of them were tile-based, i.e. had a text mode with font in RAM. Sprites in these cases were moving by characters. Those that weren't tile-based had non-linear layout anyway, often bitpacked. This makes primitive drawing not very effective.<br /><br />ZX Spectrum video memory layout is one bright example: the screen consist three parts 256x64 pixels that are placed in the memory one by another (2048 bytes/third, 6144 bytes screen without color); each third has 32 bytes of the top scanline of the top characters row, then 32 bytes of the top scanline of the second characters row, after all rows the second scanline goes etc. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=FdfJhTle8fg#t=24s" class="postlink">This</a> is how it looks if the video memory is filled byte by byte.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=4205">Shiru</a> — Sat Nov 03, 2012 11:06 am</p><hr />

They're bit mapped screen. It's just a huge buffer of X bytes, and then 1/2/4/8 bits make up one pixel across the whole screen. Want to move an object? You have to remove the object from the screen, replace the background, and then place the object at another place on the screen. Any more than a few objects and you'll be spanning stuff over multiple frames all the time.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=4311">3gengames</a> — Sat Nov 03, 2012 11:05 am</p><hr />

It's not clear from the blurb Tepples posted if this model PC allowed &quot;dirty writes&quot; to VRAM like the Commodore 64 did. On the C64 you could write to VRAM at any time, but doing so during the frame would produce snow on the display (or even incorrect tiles) because the CPU always won the bus conflict over the video unit. Meaning if the video generator was trying to figure out what color a pixel needed to be, but the CPU was accessing the VRAM bus at the same time, it'd see whatever was on the CPU data bus rather than what the ROM / RAM was trying to assert on the bus.<br /><br />This may be the &quot;Fast&quot; and &quot;Slow&quot; modes being referenced.<br /><br />Then again it does say something about disabling the display, which sounds more like forced blanking on the NES.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3706">qbradq</a> — Fri Nov 02, 2012 4:36 pm</p><hr />

This kind of rendering is not specific to Japanese PCs, it was commonly used in old adventure games because a full screen image could be stored in very little space. Just a few LINE and PAINT commands were enough to draw something meaningful. However, the drawing routines needed to manipulate the display pixel by pixel, something that's fairly slow in systems with tiled displays. First they have to calculate the position of the tile where the pixel is, then read the byte where the pixel is, modify it and write it back.<br /><br />Of course there are techniques to speed things up, but it will still seem slow in these old computers/consoles. Tepples mentioned <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nkGA1qDcL1k" class="postlink">Videomation</a> for the NES, but even <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BEFsbDGE-4E" class="postlink">Art Alive</a> on the Genesis/MD is pretty slow when drawing things pixel by pixel.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=95">tokumaru</a> — Fri Nov 02, 2012 3:15 pm</p><hr />

I just call it &quot;line drawing and flood fills&quot;.

I've been looking around for information on various Famicom games that were ported from earlier PC titles, specifically those made by Enix (Door Door, Portopia, etc.). Finding decent technical info (in English) on Japanese PCs is tough, but I have a question that likely applies to several Z80-based processors from that era.<br /><br />In <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qum6D8gSzWc" class="postlink">this YouTube clip</a> (skip to around 2:45) of Portopia on the NEC PC-6001/6601, graphics are drawn in a kind of 'vector-style' -- individual lines and shapes first, then color fills. It's remarkably slow compared to the NES. What is this rendering mode called? And what is the technical explanation for this technique? The <a href="http://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/PC-8800%E3%82%B7%E3%83%AA%E3%83%BC%E3%82%BA" class="postlink">Japanese wikipedia article</a> on the PC-8801 appears to have a paragraph explaining the slow drawing mode, but the English translation is too poor to figure out what's going on.<br /><br />Any info is appreciated.
