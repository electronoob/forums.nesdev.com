I downloaded FCEUX 2.2.0 and the current interim build 2.2.2-2963 this morning and the rom worked correctly on both but not FCEUX 2.2.1.  So it seems apparent it was a bug that was introduced in that emulator version and then fixed later on.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3601">jstout</a> — Sun Jun 30, 2013 11:23 am</p><hr />

I debugged some more and it appears that the IRQ fires too soon in FCEUX. By the time the your IRQ handler starts (i.e. the code at $C38C), FCEUX is around PPU cycle/pixel 306, while Nintendulator is around cycle 11 of the next scanline. Quite a big difference, enough to have your PPU writes that should take place during HBlank happening too soon.<br /><br />Since, according to the wiki, the correct behavior would be for the NMI to fire at cycle 324, FCEUX is obviously in a hurry. Nintendulator on the other hand, appears to be correct, considering that the IRQ can happen in the middle of an instruction (which has to finish before the IRQ can be serviced) and that the CPU needs some time (7 cycles?) to actually enter the IRQ routine, cycle 11 of the next scanline sounds about right (3 cycles of a possible unfinished instruction + 7 cycles to enter the IRQ handler = 10 CPU cycles = 30 PPU cycles; 324 + 30 = 354; since each scanline is 341 PPU cycles long, 354 - 341 = 13).<br /><br />So now that you know for sure that the problem is in FCEUX, you have to make a decision: will you try to fix the problem? If yes, I'd suggest you switch the sides of the sprite and background tiles, use the standard MMC3 configuration and adjust the timing of the PPu writes according to that configuration, to see if FCEUX agrees with the other emulators in that case.<br /><br />You can obviously chose to ignore the problem, because you know it's nothing wrong with your software.

I'd say that working in Nestopia, Nintendulator and real hardware but failing in FCEUX is better than any other permutation of those elements! =) I will have to see what's going on in FCEUX though... it's definitely possible to get a clean split on it, I've done it before.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=95">tokumaru</a> — Sat Jun 29, 2013 5:17 pm</p><hr />

Indeed this works in Nestopia and Nintendulator, which says that the timing is correct. If you add/remove NOPs can you make it look right in FCEUX? I wonder if the MMC3 IRQ timing isn't wrong in that emulator.<br /><br />Now you guys are making me doubt it ever worked in FCEUX!!! Seriously though, I remember it working there, but I think I used a sprite 0 hit to time the effect, not an IRQ. I could be wrong though.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=95">tokumaru</a> — Sat Jun 29, 2013 4:40 pm</p><hr />

When you are experimenting undocumented behavior, like manipulating registers at odd times, using open bus values, etc. then yes, what the hardware does should be the definitive answer (even though different revisions might behave differently). But when you're working with behavior that has been documented for years (loopy's skinny doc), and has been implemented in every NES emulator made in the past 10+ years, a failure on emulators could mean that something is wrong, even if it appears to work 100% on hardware.<br /><br />I wouldn't call that &quot;catering to emulator oddities&quot;, because these emulators were made to work with this kind of code. They were supposed to handle this correctly, and if they aren't, that might be a sign that your code isn't as safe as it could be. Just because you didn't see any errors during the 1 minute you tested your code on your own console, that doesn't mean that inside a game engine running for several hours on a console on the other side of the planet the same code wouldn't cause problems because it wasn't safe enough.<br /></div><br />None of this has any relevancy to <strong>this specific issue at hand</strong> -- he's using your code (now/at this point), which we know works on actual hardware (right?), yet doesn't work on one emulator.  Thus I do think it's safe to say in this case &quot;fuck FCEUX&quot;.  :-)  I bet it doesn't work on Nesticle either -- oh shit, what do we do!?

koitsu, I have to disagree with you. When you are experimenting undocumented behavior, like manipulating registers at odd times, using open bus values, etc. then yes, what the hardware does should be the definitive answer (even though different revisions might behave differently). But when you're working with behavior that has been documented for years (loopy's skinny doc), and has been implemented in every NES emulator made in the past 10+ years, a failure on emulators could mean that something is wrong, even if it appears to work 100% on hardware.<br /><br />I wouldn't call that &quot;catering to emulator oddities&quot;, because these emulators were made to work with this kind of code. They were supposed to handle this correctly, and if they aren't, that might be a sign that your code isn't as safe as it could be. Just because you didn't see any errors during the 1 minute you tested your code on your own console, that doesn't mean that inside a game engine running for several hours on a console on the other side of the planet the same code wouldn't cause problems because it wasn't safe enough.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=95">tokumaru</a> — Sat Jun 29, 2013 3:58 pm</p><hr />
