In the late game design phase and starting coding and asset creation (fonts, tiles, etc..)<br /><br />I'm wondering how people go about enticing an indie publisher to bite.  Does one make a flyer as if I was selling an Arcade game?  Hand over the game design document? Submit a small demo ROM?

Has a page up with terms and everything.  I'm actually more worried about impressing people like Super Fighter Team and Magical Game Factory blokes.  They seem a bit closer to traditional publishing outfits.  If anything from the homebrew scene can seem so <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />

They don't look anymore professional than any of the other hobbyists involved in this retro business. I know that many of these so called &quot;publishers&quot; don't even manufacture their own PCSs and cartridge cases, and still resort to recycling used carts... unlike Retrozone, who makes everything new.<br /><br />Anyway, why do you feel like you need to impress them? Good retro games aren't so easy to come by, so if your game is on par with their quality standards they'll publish it, otherwise they won't. There's not much you can do to &quot;impress&quot; them other than making a quality game. If the game isn't good, there's nothing else you can do to change their minds.

It's no surprise that NES game developers want to see their work available in actual carts, with nice labels and all. Making a few bucks in the process wouldn't hurt either.

At least half of all professional software projects fail, and for indie stuff it's even higher. I'm gonna presume that the time/cost to make the game is something you're writing off anyway because you're doing it on your own time because you love it, etc. Targeting the NES platform is not exactly the best business decision, though a very select few people seem to have made a decent living at it these days.<br /><br />For these reasons I'm going to say just finish the game first. If you don't have experience and/or finished games to show off, no publisher is going to care about your game that is currently just ideas and sketches. Once it's done, or at least finished enough to be fun and playable, it should be fairly easy to sell to somebody who is in a proper position to publish that kind of game.<br /><br />When you do sell it, negotiate a proper contract. <span style="text-decoration: underline">Hire a lawyer</span> to look over your contract.<br /><br />If you make a hit game, or you've been involved in successful game projects before, it'll be a lot easier to convince people to look at your work, but until you have that to show, honestly, I've met a thousand people with ideas and just-started game projects -- these things aren't worth anything unless they belong to somebody who has already proven their ability to finish something.<br /><br />Though, there's also kickstarter. The rules are different there. Regular people who aren't in the publishing business will vote with their hearts, so a good pitch from an unproven developer can get a good reaction there, sometimes. It's also very low risk. You might consider this route first. Also consider self publishing with this method; if you just want to build a small run of carts and get them into the world, this might be a good way to raise the modest funds you need to do so.

After awhile you know when something can be followed through and when to drop it.<br /><br />My goal is to make this game physically available to enthusiasts without cutting into rent or groceries.  Phat loot or finding an inroad to EA Games doesn't even begin to enter the picture.  I don't need to explain the buzz you get from completing a game you developed.  I can't explain the excitement of holding a copy of Battle Kid or Hangman SG.  These are all things we know and need to share.<br /><br />I guess the consensus so far ranges from a small information packet to a demo ROM.  Perhaps doing both would suffice. <br /><br />Thanks for the advice everyone.  Truly!

Seriously? It's freaking hangman, any programmer can code that in a day, I see absolutely no merit in having that in a cartridge.<br /><br />I don't want to be mean to anyone, I'm sure the programmers were proud of themselves, and if the thing did sell, that proves that there was a market for it, but IMO that's not the kind of game that deserves a cartridge release, and it saddens me to think that better commercial games might have been sacrificed (for boards and shells) in order for this to be produced.

I can't explain the excitement of holding a copy of Battle Kid or Hangman SG. These are all things we know and need to share.</div><br /><br />Right. This is doable. Personally, I've been making cartridges of my first NES project (with retrousb parts) and selling them at a price where I can make enough back on each cart to justify the labour involved. As Shiru was saying, you don't really need a publisher to accomplish this. It requires an initial investment of a few hundred dollars on tools and parts, but you can probably recover that on the sales of the first 30 carts or so. If you can get someone like retrousb to do the manufacturing/distribution work for you, they'll have lower overhead and can probably sell it for a lower price than you would doing it yourself.<br /><br />What I don't quite understand is what you're seeking a publisher for at this stage, though. If your game isn't ready to sell, and you're going to finish it on your own anyway, what do you want from a publisher? Anyone could give you a no-commitment standing offer to publish your game &quot;if it's good&quot;, but that would be no different than if you finished it anyway.<br /><br />I was part of a startup game studio for about two years, and we pitched game ideas to publishers constantly, but we were asking them to pay us to make a game for them. If you don't need that, what is the publisher for at this stage?
