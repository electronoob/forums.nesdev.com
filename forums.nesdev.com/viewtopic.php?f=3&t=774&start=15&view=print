<br />
<br />Thank you very much, hap, for telling me where I could download Fx3's palette.
<br />
<br />The best-looking palette that I have found so far is the default palette used in nnnesterJe023.
<br />
<br />I do indeed like Fx3's palette better than most palettes I've seen. But it still has what I would call definite problems.
<br />
<br />The opening ninja duel scene in "Ninja Gaiden (U) [!].nes" looks like it's occuring in the daytime with Fx3's NTSCPalette.pal . I don't have an actual NES with me, but I always thought that the scene was a night-time battle with a full moon in the sky--not a day-time battle with the sun in the sky. At least that's how I recall it as a kid. The nnnesterJe023 default palette makes it look like it's occuring at night like I recall it, and the colors still look very nice. Also, parts of the metel in the city background in the first level look too lavender with Fx3's NTSCPalette.pal, whereas it looks more suitably metel-like with the nnnesterJe023 palette (i.e., instead of lavender, it's a slight blue tint).
<br />
<br />I also like nnnesterJe023 default palette slightly better in "Super Mario Bros. (JU) (PRG0) [!].nes", although both of them look pretty good in this game. Mario's shirt contrasts better against the blue sky with the nnnesterJe023 default palette.
<br />
<br />I notice that the lighter shade of green is very bright with Fx3's NTSCPalette.pal . I think it comes off as a bit too garish in NES games. I think it also contributes to causing problems, such as with the ninja duel scene I spoke of above (although I believe a number of colors are too intense in that scene with Fx3's NTSCPalette.pal).
<br />
<br />I've compared a number of different default NES emulator palettes, including both the included palettes from Nestopia126bin, and from rocknesx20f and virtuanes092e, etc. I dislike both of Nestopia's palettes the most, although it is certainly a great emulator--good thing we can change pallets!
<br />
<br />Anyway, if others here would like to check out the default palette from nnnesterJe023 they can extract it from the program, available at the below URL. Go to Option &gt; Edit Palette and then simply do a SAVE on the included palette.

<br />
<br />Just so you know where my memories are coming from, I grew up in the U.S., so my recollections of the actual NES are from common U.S. NTSC TV sets. Not that I'm necessarily looking for crappy-TV fidelity, I'm mostly interested in a good-looking palette. But fidelity does become an issue for me if it makes a difference as to whether the opening ninja dual scene in Ninja Gaiden is occuring at night (like I always thought it was) or at day.
<br />
<br />And just so we're all on the same page here, my monitor is adjusted for a gamma correction of 2.2 at a temperature of 6500 K. The below two webpages are great resources for setting one's gamma.

<br />If we're not using some standard gamma when discussing palettes then we're not even discussing the same color variations.

<br />
<br />The NES palette issue is so complex. You have the NES video waveform itself, then the decoder in the TV, the picture tube's non-linear response, and the colors of the phosphors it uses. That gives variation in how a NES looks. Then on an emulator you have variation in which NES palette you use, any color correction done by the OS/video card, the video card's D/A curves, whatever the monitor's circuitry does to the signal, the picture tube's non-linear response, and the colors of its phosphors.
<br />
<br />In theory, for an emulator we can calibrate everything so that a given palette looks the same on everyone's computer, leaving the only remaining problem the choice of palette. But is this calibration a real possibility?

<br />But the nonlinear response and phosphor colors of a TV tube are similar to the nonlinear response and phosphor colors of a PC CRT monitor, right? Goal #1 for an NES palette generator is for large areas to look roughly the same when I alt-tab between my TV input card and an NES emulator.

<br />
<br />Taking the art we use on the console, and throwing it up on a PC tends to be more subdued, less saturated, and a little lighter at the normal video settings.
<br />
<br />On the consoles, the low end drops off quicker, and colors are generally a bit brighter and more saturated. The DAC's respond a bit differently as well.
<br />
<br />GC's tend to be a bit more colorful, whereas the ps2 seems to run it's white level really hot.
<br />
<br />I believe the issue is related to PC's generally being set up for a gamma of 1 (linear RGB), whereas the TV's have a slightly lower one.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />PCs are set up to approximate sRGB, which uses gamma=2.2. The higher black level of TV (7.5%) may be mimicking a higher gamma of 2.5. (I just checked in a graphing calculator program, and the curve for g=2.2 black=7.5% resembles that for g=2.5 black=0.) The Game Boy Advance also seems to have a ridiculously high black level (25%) that wasn't taken into account on launch titles.
