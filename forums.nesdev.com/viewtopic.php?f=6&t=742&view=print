		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />As I recall, there seems to be known revisions of the 2A03, the 2A03E, 2A03G and 2A03H.  The first was used in early Famicoms, the Nintendobox, Playchoice-10s.  The second is by far more common, seen in everything from R/F Famicoms to A/V Famicoms (like mine, manufactured after the N64's release.)  The third is very obscure and I have never seen one outside a NES top-loaderor Famicom AV, and even many of those use the more common revision G.  
<br />
<br />Brad Taylor's 2A03 Technical Reference says that the 2A03E does not support the noise channel's 93-bit short mode.  As far as we know no revision E chip was used in consumer based NES hardware, but what about Famicoms?  If a game uses this mode and is using a system with a 2A03E, he will hear the 15-bit long mode, which sounds different.  I would hope that not many games used the short mode, but someone else must say.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I should note that Brad Taylor's 2A03/2C02 "Technical Reference" documents are nothing more than compilations, containing numerous pieces of information that were never properly tested and some of which are outright <strong>false</strong>. The best example is his claim that the MMC3 watched for 42 toggles of PPU A13 (between 0000-1FFF and 2000-3FFF) to run its scanline counter, despite the fact that neither PPU A13 nor /A13 are even connected to the MMC3 - it actually uses PPU A12 (between 0000-0FFF/2000-2FFF and 1000-1FFF/3000-3FFF) with a simple filter to detect the transition between background and sprite tile rendering.
<br />
<br />The idea of earlier CPU+APU revisions lacking looped noise may turn out to be nothing more than a rumour, just as the idea that the Famicom lacked RAW PCM (which was clearly proved false, since many Famicom games use it).

<br />
<br />I know that the Famicombox uses it, as shown on Kevin Horton's site.  I have also seen it used in a Famicom Twin (which had to have been released no earlier than 1986), as shown at 
<br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://assembler.roarvgm.com/famicomtwin.html">http://assembler.roarvgm.com/famicomtwin.html</a><!-- m -->
<br />Finally, it is designated in Nintendo of America's Playchoice-10 schematic.  
<br />
<br />By far the G revision is most common, but some Top-Loaders and Famicom AVs (fortunately not mine) use revision H.  I am wary, why disturb a successful design?

<br />But it's the most accurate compilation that many of us in the community know of. I know of at least two of us here who would like to see somebody go through Brad Taylor's docs, find all the specific inaccuracies, explain <em>why</em> they're inaccurate, and post the explanations to the wiki.
<br />
<br />Or to put it another way:
<br />NESTECH 2 &gt; Marat's doc
<br />Brad Taylor's docs &gt; NESTECH
<br />What docs &gt; Brad Taylor's docs?
<br />
<br />This is post #6502; is this an omen?
