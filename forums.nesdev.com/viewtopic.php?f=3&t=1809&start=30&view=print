And yet, the emulators that do use databases are bsnes, Super Sleuth and Nestopia; written by me, Overload and Marty. The emulators that don't support databases are ZSNES, SNES9x and NESticle. You tell me what's wrong with that.</div></div>
<br />
<br />I just saw this now... must have missed it before.
<br />
<br />I really, really, REALLY hate being misquoted.  Especially in a way which makes me look like a total douche.
<br />
<br />If someone can point out where I said that using a database encourages adding game-specific hacks... I'd love to see that.  Because to the best of my knowledge I never did.
<br />
<br />What I SAID was that I don't see the difference between CRC checking for one thing or CRC checking for another.  You could say that I view using a CRC database in itself is a game-specific hack (since, when you think about it, each CRC entry is game specific...  and a "hack" would be subbing in-game operation with replacement information --- which such a database lookup does).
<br />
<br />
<br />If you want to put me on the record like "Disch feels CRC databases are a game specific hack" or something of that sort, go right ahead.  That's where I stand.
<br />
<br />Saying that I feel it encourages game specific hacks to correct emulation bugs is a total misquote  (and the fact that it's in quotes... yet it's something I never said... maybe they just took someone else's quote and put my name to it?).
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />Person A:  "Downloading commercial ROMs is piracy.  That's a crime."
<br />Person B:  "OMFG did you hear person A?  He things downloading ROMs leads to crimes like rape and murder!"
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />EDIT --
<br />
<br />Yeah I overreacted, so what, wanna fight about it?
<br />
<br />But seriously, I did kind of overdo it.  Was at work, blew it out of perportion.  I'm not really that upset.  It's all about the love and peace.

<br />
<br />Specifically the part where you "fail to see the distinction between..." and "they're all sloppy hacks". But my quote was more of what Nach and pagefault were saying on IRC. Sorry, after arguing with them about "what leads to hacks", seeing your comment got under my skin. It appeared to me you were saying the same thing they were. That using CRCs was akin to use game-specific hacks and/or encouraged using them. Which, so far, has not been the case for any NES or SNES emulator I'm aware of. In fact, it's been the very opposite. Whereas the emulators Nach and pagefault maintain <em>do</em> contain game-specific hacks. N64 and above, sure. Those use DBs for hack information. But that's not what system we're talking about here. Those systems could also just as easily use CRC detection internally to the emulator if they wanted. The fact they're using a DB makes no difference to their use of hacks.
<br />
<br />My apologies for misquoting you.
