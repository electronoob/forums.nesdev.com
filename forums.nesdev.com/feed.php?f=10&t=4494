I'd like to point out that once you understand how to get things to run on the NES, it's not really a case of it being hard. The difficult part is trying to learn how to code <em>well</em> for efficiency. This is something that I struggle with, but I feel like I get new revelations on how to do things with each new program I make. This is why I like to recommend to people that they should start small. In this way, they don't get in over their head, and at the same time get some satisfaction out of a finished product.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=174">Roth</a> — Fri Oct 24, 2008 7:56 pm</p><hr />

Actually, many people *don't* know the things you mentioned.  That's why they asked.<br /><br />In addition to reading through the technical docs on this site and the wiki, I'd recommend heading over to nintendoage.com, registering for the forums, and checking out the 'Nerdy Nights' tutorial in the 'Brewery' section of the forums.  It starts from the basics and gets you up to speed with CPU architecture, sprite and nametable basics, 6502 basics, etc.  It's gives you enough flavor to decide whether you'll want to continue or not.<br /><br />It seems most people sputter out after realizing how tough it is to program for the NES.

The reason I said:<br />[quote=Myselfironfist61"]I'd like it if you assume I do not know anything.[/quote]<br /><br />Is because all I know is cluttered within' my head. <br />Some examples for this case are that I know some things without  knowing the terms, or I know things but not completely. <br /><br />In a nutshell: I have decided to relearn everything.Hence I do not know the basics.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">SecretServiceDude wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"><br />Welcome,<br /><br /><br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">ironfist61 wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">I'd like it if you assume I do not know anything.<br /></div><br />Could you give us a sense of what you <em>do</em> know?
