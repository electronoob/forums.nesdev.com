Random comment in passing for @Espozo: if you're ever willing to try learning C, I'd be happy to buy you <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0393979504" class="postlink">C Programming: A Modern Approach, 2nd Edition</a> by K.N. King, which is worth every cent.  It's probably the best C book I've ever read; extremely good visual diagrams, layouts, clear explanations, and great real-world examples.  Having some assembly background (meaning conceptually) really helps when it comes to understanding C, especially pointers (the #1 thing people have trouble grasping -- but assembly programmers tend to say &quot;oh it's just indirect addressing, got it&quot; and that's the end of it), and some of the syntax (no argument, it get a little hairy at times).  Just let me know + get an Amazon wishlist + add it and it'll appear.<br /><br />And as for those PC prices: I'm the one laughing.  Those really aren't very expensive.  Shall I scan or photograph the sales receipt for my Apple IIGS, circa late 80s?  Or maybe point you to <a href="http://www.vintagecomputing.com/wp-content/images/retroscan/morrow_hd_large.jpg" class="postlink">something like this</a>?<br /><br />Know your roots.  And in knowing your roots, realise how ridiculously affordable computers/technology is today.  What you get now, for how much you pay now, is pocket change compared to then.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3">koitsu</a> — Wed Feb 25, 2015 11:17 pm</p><hr />

Well, dang... The GBA can run a seemingly perfect port of Doom 2, (censorship doesn't affect processor speed <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=":wink:" title="Wink" /> ) and it definitely doesn't have anything like 4 MB of ram. I guess the GBA's small resolution helps cuts back on CPU power. (Which I know isn't directly related to ram, but still.) Do you know what resolution Doom was running in in the video? I know the GBA technically has a 32 bit processor, but from what I've heard, it takes quite a performance hit when accessing rom when in 32 bit mode, (If I remember correctly) so it's better to just use Thumb which is 16 bit. Of course, CPU speed isn't everything as some processors are more efficient than others<span style="font-size: 4%; line-height: normal">I'm looking at you, Stef.</span><p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=6683">Espozo</a> — Wed Feb 25, 2015 9:47 pm</p><hr />
