If you need to do it, you <em>probably</em> know something about what you're doing. Writing an NMI is probably the trickiest task a novice NES programmer might have on their plate, I don't think general-purpose advice about the sprite rendering flag will really make it easier.<br /><br />An application to PAL seems even less relevant, given its vastly longer vblank period. Also, there's a caveat there that OAM DMA should be done last if rendering is going to be turned on late (since its data isn't stable much longer than a vblank). That's a bit of a silent killer, since nobody seems to emulate OAM decay.<br /><br />What did we determine about the PAL vblank and OAM before, I can't quite remember. Does it force an OAM refresh midway through its vblank? (Was there a conflict if you try to OAM DMA too late?) Does it require the sprite rendering flag to be set in $2001 by that point? There's some hariy details here.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=5165">rainwarrior</a> — Tue Mar 25, 2014 11:59 am</p><hr />

Sure, you can do this, but then the behavior of the PPU changes from what would normally be expected coming out of vblank. If I understand correctly, &quot;So as long as rendering is reenabled before x=304&quot; the PPU should behave the same as normal. And you need timed code, etc.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=4680">Movax12</a> — Tue Mar 25, 2014 10:18 am</p><hr />

It's good to have a clear explanation of this. Thanks tepples. Sorry for the misunderstanding in the other thread rainwarrior.<br /><br />The game I was working on does a lot of nametable writes for smooth animation of the blocks falling. It is an attempt to port Jack Attack for the C64. Right now it just displays and animates the levels (up and down to change level). Platform colors are not correct. <br /><br />It will delay adding more blocks from the top if the vram write time is reached, so I could benifit from more time, but I can ignore the issue without much consequence. (I can say that the animation looks a lot better than the C64 version.)<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=4680">Movax12</a> — Tue Mar 25, 2014 8:53 am</p><hr />

The rendering circuitry needs from x=321 to x=336 of this line to fetch the first two slivers of line 0 of the background, but it uses the bus the whole time if rendering is enabled. During the prerender scanline, if rendering is enabled, the PPU copies some bits from the scroll position (address <em>t</em> in Loopy's &quot;<a href="http://wiki.nesdev.com/w/index.php/The_skinny_on_NES_scrolling" class="postlink">The skinny on NES scrolling</a>&quot;) to the video memory address (address <em>v</em>) to set up scrolling:<br /><ul><li>At x=257 (right side of picture), it copies the horizontal bits (0-4 and 10).

The horizontal copy might be delayed by a scanline if rendering is disabled at x=257, causing wrong horizontal scrolling on the first scanline of the picture (which is well within NTSC's overscan). But it'll fix itself by the second scanline, and in any case, it overwhelmingly likely won't affect sprite 0 overlap detection.<br /><br />It takes 6 cycles to disable rendering (<tt style="margin-left: 2px; margin-right: 2px; padding:3px; background-color: #3355aa; color: white;">LDA #$00 STA $2001</tt> and 6 to reenable it (<tt style="margin-left: 2px; margin-right: 2px; padding:3px; background-color: #3355aa; color: white;">LDA #$1E STA $2001</tt>), yet it adds about 100 cycles (x=1 to x=300, 1 cycle per 3 dots) of usable video memory access time. I had to hack NES15, a game on the STREEMERZ multicart, to disable rendering while updating video memory because the multicart's NMI dispatch routine pushed updates just barely into the prerender line, causing visible artifacts on my NES.<br /><br />Anyone have a specific test ROM demonstrating when video memory becomes inaccessible?<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=9">tepples</a> — Tue Mar 25, 2014 6:35 am</p><hr />
