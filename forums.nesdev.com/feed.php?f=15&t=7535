Funny how most GB games I tried sound nice with BL synthesis regardless for audio channels <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" /> For my emu, definately gonna go with bandlimited. I just think it makes sense not to avoid it:<br /><br />Example: <br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://blargg.fileave.com/nes-emu/Zelda_OoA_clip.mp3">http://blargg.fileave.com/nes-emu/Zelda_OoA_clip.mp3</a><!-- m --><br /><br /><img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" /><br /><br />edit: Damn, Blargg's links are dead. Anyway, VBA now uses BL synthesis for GB/GBC and the GBA GB channels.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=4416">mudlord</a> — Thu Mar 03, 2011 7:51 am</p><hr />

When emulators weren't that accurate in the early GBA era, I submitted a bunch of test cases to the maintainer of VisualBoyAdvance, all of which I had tested on my GBA using an "MBV2" transfer cable. If only Game Boy flash cards were more widely available, then you could make a Game Boy demo that <em>needs</em> the bandlimited synthesis in order not to sound like crap.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=9">tepples</a> — Thu Mar 03, 2011 6:01 am</p><hr />

Using this to test my Windows 7 installation.<br /><br />While I am at it:<br />I wonder what the fuck is with the constant bans byuu and Fitzfuck make. Quite the duo they are. Especially when someone else (Themaister) does a better job at a emulator than the actual dev...ROFL. I do find that odd. On the other hand, mixing Snes9x and libsnes seems.....convoluted at best.<br /><br />I have some complaints with the waterpaint shader. Some edge detection (Sobel?) would be nice to be used, to bring out more of the colours. Also, a better range of colouring should be used instead of the current drab shading used. Using Cg however, is a superb choice, and I am working on supporting that in my GBX emulator, too. I noticed some people ported some of my shaders without my permission but thats okay, I guess its all payback for being a troll.<br /><br />Speaking of that, how do you define trollishness. I am dying to hear it. Does saying bsnes stink for not working right on a hex core = trolling. Maybe, because I found now with this new setup of a hex core and 8GB RAM, BSNES runs splendidly! I can now run the accuracy core fine! Oh what a difference a major hardware upgrade does to perceptions of software. <br /><br />Speaking of software I must digress. This most recent effort seems bleh. Bandlimited synthesis is *not* bloat, unlike what a certain person thinks and instead, chosen to implement all the GB channels in seperate files. But no matter, no matter, that can be fixed when Gb_Snd_Emu from blargg is used. Same goes for NES I think. Make it bandlimited, no need to use a crap hermite resampler. <br /><br />Speaking of resampling, I do find it perplexing that ratios must be used to specify the rate which audio syncs. I do think thats a bit heavy handed, but I do hope that this gets remedied, soon.<br /><br />Speaking of audio sync, I also find it funny that people say DirectSound is deprecated or its useless. Its only useless if people use it wrong.<br /><br />Speaking of funny, I really do enjoy all those articles. Especially "why accuracy matters". Wow, I never would have thought someone had the gall to tell others how to do thier jobs. On the other hand, it makes quite a compelling argument. Accuracy should be strived for, while knowledge that speed can be good too, for portable/embedded systems. Its most funny how some people see source as documentation. How is that possible? Take MAME for instance, with its obtuse code and all, HOW can it be considered documentation? You need to be Aaron to at least comprehend that mess. ZSNES however, is not documentation at all, so its messiness is justified. Same with Snes9x, loads others. The one thing I can say about bsnes is that its clean. Nice job there. Shame about the MSVC suppport (or lack thereof).<br /><br />Speaking of MSVC I do find it quite nice. Visual Assist X is a very nice addon to supplement the source lexers. It does a nice job of spellchecking, formatting, and notifying you to orgarnise your code better. It quite is swell.<br /><br />You know what else is swell? QuickNES. Blargg should be very proud.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=4416">mudlord</a> — Wed Mar 02, 2011 4:44 pm</p><hr />
