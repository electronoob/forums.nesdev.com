		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Teenage mutant ninja turtles fighter (TMNT 4 perhaps) has got a big sized fighter i.e. Hothead.If both the players select hothead then they will occupy a big sprite area on the screen which I feel shuold use more than 64 sprites. Any ideas how this can be achieved? possibly some type of interlacing done within the sprites??

<br />
<br />well...I did not think of 8x16 sprites. But yes,  they may do the trick!
<br />1)How do we tell NES what size of sprite we are using? In the sprite ram we have only 1 byte for the CHR tile index. 8x16 sprite means 2 8x8 tiles in the CHR rom?

<br />
<br />Atari 2600 had 2 sprites, and many games flickered the sprites to put more on screen.  But they had the advantage of older TVs having more phosphor persistance, where the pixel on the screen will continue to glow for a good while after it was drawn.

(It was easier to pull this off than it might sound to NES veterans; a write to one of the registers would halt the CPU until hblank as a side effect, and there wasn't any pesky fraction-of-a-cycle at the end of a line.) A <em>lot</em> of title screens were 3 pairs of replicated sprites. Video Chess used 2 pairs of replicated sprites to draw 4 chess pieces and then flickered them with odd lines of odd sprites and even lines of even sprites in one field and vice versa in the other. (Incidentally, development versions of Video Chess were larger than the 2600's standard 4 KiB ROM window and thus prompted the invention of mappers.)<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">and many games flickered the sprites to put more on screen.

<br />That and no 5-line delay for rewriting OAM, so the 8x1-pixel sprites could be multiplexed up and down as much as they wanted.
<br />
<br />But you're right that black-and-white TV phosphors would generally persist more than those of color TVs. In fact, red persisted so long, even in the Super NES era, that Nintendo made the Super Scope insensitive to red light, instead requiring games to have a slight cyan cast over the entire screen.

<br />
<br /> Which part is that? How would it look any worse on your TV? Or do you mean PAL 50hz flicker looks worse than NTSC 60hz flicker?
