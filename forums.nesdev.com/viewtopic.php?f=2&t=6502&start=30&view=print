The lack of disclosure of things like this up front from the get-go is unacceptable; transparency is good.  That said, having a list of games and demos which get impacted by this decision is good too, that way Tim can say &quot;this PPU feature isn't implemented, and to date that feature is only known to affect the following games/demos&quot;.  It's a win-win for everyone.

There's a feature of the PPU that the Nesdev Wiki calls The background palette hack. I decided not to implement it because it would take significant resources in the PLD. It didn't seem like a useful feature to me and I don't think a single game uses it.</div><br /><br />That sounds fair to me - does Micro Machines specifically utilize this technique of modifying the background color? I can try Micro Machines if I know what I'm looking for.<br /><br />EDIT: It seems I can not test Micro Machines as the Everdrive N8 I own will not run it.</div><br /><br /> There was a big rom hack that didn't work on this RGB thingy. It had to with the way RGB device wasn't handling the mirroring of.. I think it was palette ram? It was a mirror of something in the PPU address, that the hacker left in the upper bits of the address, because it saved a couple of bytes and cycles (and worked on the real hardware). I forget what the hack was (popular megaman one?).

Anyway, the problem was specifically PPU upper bits of the address to read/write, act as if they don't do anything (the upper 2 bits, maybe? Thus a mirroring effect, whatever you want to call it). But I think a newer revision of this RGBNES fixes that (ver 1.7 ???).
