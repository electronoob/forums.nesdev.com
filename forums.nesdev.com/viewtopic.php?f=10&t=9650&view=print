Just wanted to know what is the EASIEST, plain english, book to get started with programming NES games.<br />Thanks for your time and input.

Money, and 2. Time, as assembly at it's core isn't difficult. It's  honestly so easy, most problems are because of overcomplication.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />First things first: 6502 assembly is the least important thing you have know in order to make NES games. It's just a language, a way to communicate with the system, but knowing WHAT to communicate and HOW to communicate is much more important. Programming for the NES is like getting a job in another country: learning their language will certainly help, but it won't teach you a thing about the actual work you'll be doing.<br /><br />Anyway, assembly language is very specific, so you need a book that covers the actual CPU you'll be using, in this case the 6502, otherwise you'll just get confused. As always, I suggest you practice with the <a href="http://www.exifpro.com/utils.html" class="postlink">6502 simulator</a> to make sure you understand what each instruction does and to experiment with logic in general.<br /><br />While you study assembly, you should also study how NES games work. Use the debugging features in FCEUX to analyze how games function. Watch the pattern tables, the name tables, the sprites. Try to make some sense out of how the game is generating its visuals. Game logic is also very important. You have to learn how to do things like object AI, collision detection, physics, and so on, in order to be able to successfully simulate a world within your program.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />The book that helped me get my start in assembly language in general and give me a good background for learning 6502 was &quot;Assembly Language: Step by Step.&quot; There are so many similarities between how different processors work that I don't think it really matters which one you start with (this book covers x86). The thing that makes this book shine is how it is written and how carefully and slowly it teaches the reader. The following isn't really necessary, but because I'm such a big fan of the book and how good of a teacher the author Jeff Duntemann is, I made this video advocating the book, in person: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URku_BHIR9g" class="postlink">Assembly Language: Step by Step</a>. Could very well turn out that you don't need an introduction that is quite so friendly as this, but it sure helped me along. It might be there are others out there who would benefit from it as well. Note I made that video for Nintendoage originally, I address that site verbally in the video.
