<br />That's not so far from the stuff you see in the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/view_play_list?p=01596721403E0594&amp;search_query=Sonic+3+and+Knuckles+Glitches+and+Oversights" class="postlink">Sonic 3 and Knuckles Glitches and Oversights</a> series of videos.

<br />EDIT Hehehe look at my post count: 2600. I like the Atari 2600.

<br />Howver glitches are different from secrets - they aren't intentionnal from the programmers so aren't docuumented in magazines and such. People likely just discover them non-purposely.

Those are pretty hideous glitches. But I admit, it must be hard to guarantee glitch free game-play with two players and optimized code. The whole on-screen/off-screen dilemma is a huge problem in lots of games because they can't afford (or they didn't want to afford) the memory it takes to keep track of off screen data in real time. That is why I made certain to keep track of enemy activity for at least 1/2 screen off screen in each direction. They won't respawn once they've died, but if you haven't killed enemies and they go beyond half a screen off-screen, they will become deactivated and in order for them to become active again, you have to go back to their spawning point (or you have to be a screen and a half away from their spawning point, and then move towards it). This is not the perfect solution, but it's way less annoying than killing an enemy and having it walk right back on screen so you can kill it over and over and over and over.<br /><br />And also, no matter what happens, I made sure the player never goes beyond the edge of the screen. Instead when they try and go beyond the edge, they collide with it as if it were solid. Even though the player could move around for half a screen in each direction, it just makes things easier.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">Bregalad wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">This especially remind me a part in Super Castlevania IV where you have to jump 255 times to get a roast</div><br /><br />Wow, I thought it sounded ridiculous what I said about the platform thing. That's really bizarre... Is it sitting there but it's just too high to reach or something? Or does it appear after 255 jumps?<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">Bregalad wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">Howver glitches are different from secrets - they aren't intentionnal from the programmers so aren't docuumented in magazines and such.

<br />
<br />Well of course. Usually there's something obvious that indicates something is a secret though, like a sound effect or graphical effect that happens when you discover the secret. These are most likely glitches we're looking at. It would make sense that people accidentally discover these by doing random things and mashing buttons... That's what a lot of people seem to do!
<br />
<br />EDIT: Congrats on the 2600 posts tokumaru. I always look at my post count and think if there's something significant about the number <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />.

<br />Not intentional, but still documented: Minus world. Not intentional at first, but intentional later: All the glitches Nintendo managed to replicate in Super Mario All-Stars on purpose.
