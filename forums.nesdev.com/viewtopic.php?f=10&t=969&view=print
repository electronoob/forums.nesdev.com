		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Hello,
<br />
<br />Im VERY new to nes development.  I'm decently comfortable with getting 
<br />sprites on the screen and positioning them (haven't done any movement of 
<br />sprites yet).  I'd like to try my hand at backgrounds .... thats where I need 
<br />some guidance.  At this point I have my background images separate from
<br />my sprites (in two different chr files).  So I guess my starting question is if I 
<br />have .bank 2's .org at $0000 (for the sprites) then what would I need to do 
<br />to include the background as well?  Would it be a new bank at $1000? Plus
<br />I'm also assuming (which means I could be wrong) that I need to pass 1 to 
<br />bit 4 of $2000 (PPU Control Register 1) and 1 to bit 3 of $2001 (to show the
<br />background).  Any help is greatly appreciated.

<br />That's pretty much correct. However, you'll have to first clear $2001.3 and $2001.4 to "turn screen off", that means that you can freely write your NameTable data and AttributeTable data to $2006/7 needed to have any background on screen. Once you're done, turn the screen on by setting bits 3 and 4 of $2001. If you need any other $2006/7 update while the screen is on, you have to do it during the VBlank time, right after an NMI. I don't guess you should try that at first, tough.
<br />
<br />To include a second CHR file, just insert a second .incbin the second file after the first. I assume you're using NESASM, and I cannot say you that's bad due to the fact you're a newbie, but keep in mind that there are better assemblers out there.
<br />
<br />EDIT : Oh yeah, once you have finished to draw your background, you HAVE to set the scrolling registers to get proper image on screen. To do that, wait a frame with $2002.7 or do that in your NMI routine. You should write twice to $2005 to get proper scrolling. If you don't do that (or if you just do that at reset), your scrolling will get altered by $2006 writes.

<br />What I was messing with is a potential side scroller ... but was really just 
<br />trying to find my way to get a background just visible ... which brings me 
<br />to my next question...
<br />
<br />I've been doing something like this for my sprites....
<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent"><br />&nbsp;.bss <br /><br />IMG.Y = $700<br />IMG.T = $701<br />IMG.S = $702<br />IMG.X = $703<br />... later...<br />clear the memory for sprites..<br /><br />... later ...<br />&nbsp;lda #136<br />&nbsp;sta IMG.Y<br />&nbsp;sta IMG.x<br />&nbsp;lda #1<br />&nbsp;sta IMG.T<br />&nbsp;lda #0<br />&nbsp;sta IMG.S<br />... later &#40;again&#41; ...<br /><br />lda #7<br />sta $4014 ; DMA 100x 7<br /></div>
<br />
<br />Would I need to be doing my background tiles the same way? Is this even
<br />the right way to really be doing the sprites? I've seen somethings on 
<br />name tables ... I think I understand what they are. (tile index #s in a file)
<br />Just really not sure how to make them or use them.  I downloaded the 
<br />chr2nam program but couldn't get it to work with my chr.
<br />
<br />Also, is it better to use the sprite DMA or should I be using 2003/4?
<br />
<br />Thanks so much for your help thus far.

<br />Background displaying works totally different than sprites. You'll have to fit your tile data in name tables and color data in attributes tables. (for your first try just put some data in one single nametable with screen off, wait for VBlank or for an NMI, and turn the screen on then write twice zero to $2005, be sure to write to $2000 to setup the good on-screen nametable and do sprite DMA).

<br />
<br />That's the thing, nesasm's bank handling gets in the way as much as it helps, so other assemblers are easier to deal with, not harder.

<br />wow ... boy I really realize how much I still have to learn.... can you give me a little push on how to "fit your data in a name tables and color data into

<br />something into $2006 and then the actual data into $2007???? Or am I
<br />WAY off.  Thanks for the patience for a newbie.

<br />
<br />I cannot help you much with the nametable and attribute table format, there is a lot of docs covering that. However, place your adress into $2006 (for example if you want to write at $2100 in PPU RAM to acess the nametable, write  #$21, then #$00 to $2006), and then place a data or a string of data to $2007, the adress will automatically increment (be sure to keep $2000.4 clear, else it will increment by 32, usefull only to have column strings).

<br />
<br />lynxsolaris, if you are planning a side scroller, you'll definately be using this. I don't know if you got what Bregalad said, and before you get confused about the "auto increment" thing, I'd like to say a few things.
<br />
<br />As bregalad said, you are right, just write the address where you want to draw the tiles to $2006 and then write the tiles to $2007. The auto increment makes it possible to write long runs of data by setting the address just once, when you begin. And you can choose how much to increment after every write, 1 or 32 bytes.
<br />
<br />Increments of 1 are usefull when you draw from the left to the right, and increments of 32 are usefull when you draw from the top down. So, in a side scroller, you'll be using increments of 32, to constantly add new columns of graphics in the direction the player moves.
<br />
<br />Well, it may be too soon to be thinking about the actual game, but... Well, play a little with the background and soon you'll begin scrolling stuf. I'd recommend you not to mess with the attribute table until you master the name table, ok? Just wanted to give you something to think about, so you can have an idea of how things work.
<br />
<br />I had some trouble with the background at first because back when I programmed games for MS-DOS, I used to redraw the whole screen every frame. The NES is not fast enough for that, and you must draw only what's changed from one frame to the other.

<br />
<br />I definitely agree with you there.  Right now Im just trying to get a background to read from a 
<br />chr and display the different tiles.  I'd like to make a game some point but need to have a 
<br />better understanding of this beginning items first.
<br />
<br />
<br />Thanks to both you and Bregalad for all your help so far.  I started a new little test project
<br />Here is the code I have thus far.... 
<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent"><br />&nbsp;.inesprg 1<br />&nbsp;.ineschr 1<br />&nbsp;.inesmir 0<br />&nbsp;.inesmap 0<br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;.code<br />&nbsp;.org $8000<br /><br /><br />main:<br />&nbsp;lda #%00001000<br />&nbsp;sta $2000<br />&nbsp;lda #%00001000<br />&nbsp;sta $2001<br /><br />&nbsp;jsr wait_vblank<br />&nbsp;lda #$3F<br />&nbsp;sta $2006<br />&nbsp;lda #$00<br />&nbsp;sta $2006<br />&nbsp;ldx #$00<br /><br />&nbsp;lda #$0d<br />&nbsp;sta $2007<br />&nbsp;lda #$08<br />&nbsp;sta $2007<br />&nbsp;lda #$28<br />&nbsp;sta $2007<br />&nbsp;lda #$19<br />&nbsp;sta $2007<br /><br />&nbsp;lda #$20<br />&nbsp;sta $2006<br />&nbsp;lda #$00<br />&nbsp;sta $2006<br /><br />&nbsp;lda #$01<br />&nbsp;sta $2007<br />&nbsp;lda #$02<br />&nbsp;sta $2007<br />&nbsp;lda #$03<br />&nbsp;sta $2007<br />end:<br />&nbsp;jmp end<br /><br />wait_vblank:<br />&nbsp;bit $2002<br />&nbsp;bpl wait_vblank<br />&nbsp;rts<br /><br />nmi:<br />int:<br />&nbsp;rti<br /><br />&nbsp;.bank 1<br />&nbsp;.org $FFFA<br />&nbsp;.dw nmi,main,int<br /><br />&nbsp;.bank 2<br />&nbsp;.org $0000<br />&nbsp;.incbin &quot;test.chr&quot;<br /><br /></div>
<br />My writes to the color palette work fine ($3F00).  
<br />For some reason (and maybe this is what its suppose to do) it just displays the first tile tiled
<br />over and over again.  I thought if I wrote to $2006 (twice) with $2000 and wrote my tile 
<br />numbers to $2007 that it would show them?  I believe Im missing something here ....
<br />
<br />It does seem that if I just turn on the background bit (2001.3) that it automatically tiles the
<br />first tile across the screen....

<br />
<br />Yes. The values you write to $2005 are the top left coordinates of the "camera" over the nametable. If you're not scrolling, just write 0 to $2005 twice and you'll have a full and static view of the name table you selected by writing to $2000.
<br />
<br />Scrolling is just the effect produced by successive writes to $2005. If you write 0, 0, you'll see the nametable centered on the screen. Then, in the next frame you write 1, 0, wich means the camera moved a bit to the right. Then you write 2, 0, moving one more pixel to the right, and so on.
<br />
<br />So, if you want to have a static screen you still have to write to $2005 so that the PPU knows where exactly to place the nametable on the screen.

<br />I'm still doing something wrong (obviously) because I still have blocks 
<br />(the first block image in my chr file) that tiles the entire screen.  I'm 
<br />trying to get these blocks to do two or 3 rows near the bottom of the
<br />screen.  Any pointers?  Thanks!

<br />That's because most emulators initialize RAM to contain all zeros. Be careful, though - on the real hardware, RAM is initialized to mostly <strong>random</strong> values, so you need to initialize ALL memory you use - for the PPU, this means setting the VRAM address to $2000 and then writing $00/$FF 960 times to $2007 (followed by 64 bytes of $00) and making sure that tile 00/FF is "blank".
