Details a few posts down.</strong><br /><br />Hello All,<br /><br />I have a FF4J that I bought with the intent of using it to translate<br />it to english so I had a real FF4 cart with the english translation <br />on it. Turns out this pcb only has a dip 32 chip socket and I need<br />to find a 36 pin compatible alternative as the chips I'm using need<br />the A20 address line and there just isn't on on this board. FWIW I'm<br />using a 27c160 in 8bit mode with the address lines shifted. I've used<br />this method with other games and it worked perfect so I'm sticking<br />with it.<br /><br />I already tried tying A20 to edge connector pin 46 (CPU A21) but<br />no dice. If anyone knows the name of the PCB I'm after and or the<br />titles of the games I could use I'd be very greatful.<br /><br />Thanks In Adance!

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Funnily enough I have just done the same a few days ago, the only difference being that I used a 27c801 and a 27c4001.  The PCB that FFIV lives on uses a 74LS139 to do it's address decoding.  The 139 is wired in such a way that it uses A20 and A21 to map up to 3 8Mb ROMs and a SRAM.  When A20 and A21 are low the first rom is selected but when either one is high (not both) one of the other possible roms are selected.  On the 1A3B those two additional ROM selects are not connected.  In my repro all I had to to was connect the 27c4001 to pin 5 of the 139 to get it to work.<br /><br />In your case if you want to use the original pcb you could try a simple <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diode_logic#OR_logic_gate" class="postlink">diode OR gate</a> to tie pin 4 &amp; 5 of the 139 together to make the single select signal you need for your 27c160.  I don't know if it will work I can't see it hurting anything by trying if you have a couple of diodes and a resistor spare.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Why an OR gate? Maybe I'm just too tired but let me explain what I think I saw earlier.<br /><br />Inputs A and B are A19 and A20. So When A and B are both 0, ROM Socket gets /OE.<br /><br />When A=1 and B=1 then RAM Socket gets /OE.<br /><br />So the important thing is when A and B aren't both 1 (high) then we want to enable our one and only ROM. So with the AND truth table:<br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AND_gate">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AND_gate</a><!-- m --><br /><br />When either A or B is 0 then /OE to the ROM is Low. In other words If ROM 1 or ROM 2 is getting a low /OE signal to enable, your ROM enables. <br /><br />If you use an OR gate then when either A or B is high the result is high meaning that your ROM would never get a low /OE signal.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />The 139 in FFIV is wired to proved 3 8Mb ROM /CE lines and a /CE for the SRAM, however only the first ROM /CE (call this /CE0) is connected so when the code in the translation tried to access the upper 8Mb of it's ROM it gets a open bus instead.  /CE1 and /CE2 on the 139 are not connected but still function in relation to the address decoding so what we need to do is OR /CE0 and /CE1, connecting the result to the 27c160's /E pin.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I understand that, but I think you have your operation mixed up. 0 OR 0 = 0. 0 OR 1 = 1; 1 OR 0 = 1. 1 OR 1 = 1. So only when both /CE signals are low which will NEVER happen from the 139, will you get a low /CE signal to the ROM chip. So if you used an OR gate you'd actually never access rom.<br /><br />You want an AND gate. Because if CE0 = 0 or CE1 = 0, regardless of the other the AND operation will make the product of those 0. <br /><br />0 AND 0 = 0. 0 AND 1 = 0. 1 AND 0 = 0. 1 AND 1 = 1. That means that ROM will be enabled unless BOTH CE0 and CE1 are HIGH which means that neither CE0 or CE1 is selected because they are Active Low. I don't believe I've gotten that backwards, I think you did.
