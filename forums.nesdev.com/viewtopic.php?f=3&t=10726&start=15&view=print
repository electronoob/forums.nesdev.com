		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I've had experience on both ends. There were no test ROMs on the SNES, so I had to figure out the behaviors through my own hardware tests. Whereas pretty much 100% of my NES emulator is from the Wiki and an official opcode tester.<br /><br />What I've found was that I have a much deeper understanding of how the SNES works. My NES emulator is full of weird edge cases that I don't even remotely understand, but they're well known. Things like non-linear APU mixing. It's voodoo to me.<br /><br />The SNES work is more frustrating, but upon solving it, is much more enjoyable and rewarding.<br /><br />Overall, I like the idea of test ROMs, but I don't like the way they are used. Case in point: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://tasvideos.org/EmulatorResources/NESAccuracyTests.html">http://tasvideos.org/EmulatorResources/ ... Tests.html</a><!-- m --><br /><br />According to that chart, the emulator I spent one week developing ranks higher than FCEUX and VirtuaNES. I don't think anyone here believes that. If I were to use test ROMs, I'm sure I could push it up to the top-end as well.<br /><br />But, as important as test ROMs are, and I think we should all pass them wherever possible, people need to keep in mind that these test ROMs are usually extremely pedantic, often testing things that are virtually never used. And test ROMs are <em>far</em> from comprehensive. The games are the reason we are here, and it's that which should be the center of our focus.<br /><br />For instance, what good is an emulator that passes 100% of test ROMs, but doesn't support anything but NROM? Would you trade 3% on that accuracy scorecard for dozens of supported peripherals, FDS support, etc?<br /><br />Some sort of ranking system for the importance of passing each test ROM would probably go a long way.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Good point byuu.<br /><br />Of course, if I had real hardware to test I could just pop in a flash cart and find out myself without the need to come here for help. Remember, the thrill of the chase is what counts not the catch itself. The fun is in writing the emulator not having written an emulator. If it were too easy or too quick or without the occasional problem, then there would be no fun and we would just use other people's emulators.

Considering how much other kinds of help is involved into any software development anyway (experience of other people and their creations - compilers, text editors, etc), I don't think it is even worth of discussion. If you want to have extra fun catching bugs, just don't use test ROMs; if you want to get result a little bit sooner, use them and all other possible debug tools. Execution logs of another emulator is actually WAY more valuable for this purpose.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Correct. Test ROMs don't make bugs magically disappear, rather they point out where your code is going wrong and that is what I don't like.<br /><br />Of course having the ability to port a homebrew test ROMs to actual hardware negates everything and IMHO is the best option.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Actually, test ROMs don't really point at exact place of a problem. They give a direction for search, but they can't detect a wide range of potential problems, and can give false reports, either giving you a false direction, or false sense of correctness (report OK while emulation is in fact wrong). There were threads on this forum with such cases.

Not even exaggerating the decimal places.<br /><br />More likely you could deprioritize it because most emulation users tend to not speak Japanese (around one in sixty people in the world do, and emulation isn't quite as huge in Japan as it is elsewhere.)<br /><br />&gt; You're invited to do so on the wiki.<br /><br />Thanks, but I'm not really qualified. If you add a SNESdev Wiki, I could do so with any test ROMs produced for it.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />It is interesting the extreme spectrums that exist.<br /><br />The more you put into doing your own research and running your own tests, the more the emulator becomes an expression of something you've created, rather than copied.<br /><br />You start from the beginning, with a pure black box. At best, you can determine the CPU type and find an official programming guide for it. But you have to work out the memory mapping, every register, etc from scratch.<br /><br />Then you have increasingly thorough and useful documentation.<br /><br />Then you have a huge swath of test ROMs telling you what to fix and how to fix it.<br /><br />Then you have entire processor cores, where you just write the glue code to bind them all together (fairly common in the Genesis scene.)<br /><br />Then you basically have entire emulators as libraries, where you write a frontend for it.<br /><br />Each level probably thinks of themselves as &quot;emulator authors&quot;, and hell maybe they are, even the frontend people. But they're definitely distinct tiers. And depending on which tier you are on, you probably ask why the lower tiers even bother.<br /><br />It seems very much to mirror the progressions of programmers in general: the EE logic gate types/Verilog programmers -&gt; the assembly programmers -&gt; the C programmers -&gt; the C++ programmers -&gt; the Ruby/Python programmers.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I can't fathom a world in which a test rom would be considered cheating. *Everything* is a test rom, it's just a question of how tightly controlled the situations are. They're a way of determining, fairly directly, the answer to the question &quot;What did the Real Thing do in this particular case&quot;. It's the difference between theoretical physics and applied. One of those considers the problem, writes it down, thinks really hard, and writes down the answer. The other smashes some protons together to see what comes out.<br /><br />Both are needed, and both are valid approaches. Personally, as a developer, I much prefer debugging cases with clean, reproducible tests. They leave a lot more energy left afterwards to develop more cool stuff. It does feel awesome when you finally track down and squish some evil, obscure bug through Guru level thought experiments, elbow-deep postmortem examination, and a brutal bit of luck on timing a reset or whatnot, but the only thing one feels like doing afterwards is celebrating, and not looking at code for a while.<br /><br />As for the pile of test roms we have available, they are deceptive. My FPGA NES passed every sprite 0 test there was, cleared almost all of the timing and CPU tests (precise timing of the even/odd dropped dot still elude it), and all the APU tests. It still failed cart.nes and smb1 immediately. Things they didn't catch:<br /><br />Sprite evaluation continuing with rendering disabled, clobbering the OAM address<br />No sprites showing up at all after hitting 8 on a scanline<br />Backwards, page-crossing BCCs going forwards instead<br />Envelope loop flag being hooked up to the half frame pulse instead of the reg bit<br /><br />No testsuite is completely bugtight.<br /><br />re: byuu's last post<br /><br />Some application developers use frameworks, some write straight Win32 or Xlib code. Some use C++, some use C#. All are still application developers.

I see it as a matter of effort versus value. It's easy enough to use SMB as a test to get all those things working (and have fun watching the game go from garbage to working).
