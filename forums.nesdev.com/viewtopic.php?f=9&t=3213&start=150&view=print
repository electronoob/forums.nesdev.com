Won't be doing any auto matching of game to save because some people (aka me) have multiple saves for each rom.  Displaying the name of the game and save is on my list and is just a module update.  Remembering the info between resets might happen too, but that gets dangerous if the files have moved.
<br />
<br />If you want to go back to rom listing you just hit the reset button and start over  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />  
<br />
<br />It is assumed one top and one bottom rows are cut off, which is where the bits of old file names show up when scrolling.  Nothing important is in the border ~3 rows.
<br />
<br />I haven't worked out the warranty yet.  Obviously "will not break for a long time" but guaranteeing games will run bug free cannot be a part of it.  Also can't make any promises of upgrade or fix schedule.

<br />There are guidelines. For UI, you will want to use the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safe_area" class="postlink">title safe area</a>. The BBC recommends leaving 5 percent of the top and 5 percent of the bottom unoccupied by text. On the NTSC NES, 5 percent of the screen is 12 scanlines. So don't put anything important in the top two rows or the bottom two rows.

<br />This won't work on my TV.  The name of the first file on the screen will be almost completely invisible.  I'd suggest, if it's workable, to allow for 12-pixel margins at the top and bottom of the screen (this will allow for 27 entries to be visible at once).  This should be enough to allow the top row to be readable on any set (mine might cut off a scanline or two, but most of the text graphics will still be visible).
<br />
<br />In order to avoid glitches while scrolling, you will probably want to have the screen scroll a full tile at a time, rather than scrolling in smaller increments.  This way, you can erase the filename scrolling out of range during the saame V-Blank in which you draw the new file name, then have the scroll occur at the same time these updates are done.  If you prefer to keep the smoother scrolling shown in the demo, you'll need to do a split-screen effect in order to clip the BG display at the top and bottom, but that's probably more effort than it's worth (I'd rather keep the graphical glitches than to undergo that much effort to remove them, especially since they're confined to the edges where artifacting is common in commercial games).

<br />And that is the beauty of having the redundant /. directory displayed, that is the one that will be chopped  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />    Only place that wont happen is the root directory, so you can just copy the powerpak directory to the card first so it will be cut.
<br />
<br />
<br />Title safe area is good idea but it doesnt always work on crts (my tv cuts 1 row on top and <strong>3</strong> full rows on the bottom, and no its not the alignment or hold) and my lcd tv usually shows all the screen including stuff I want hidden.  Never seen a tv that cuts the sides, that would be much harder to deal with here...

<br />Touch√©.
<br />
<br />The NTSC resolution is wider than the NES's output, so I don't think you can expect overscan issues horizontally (except at the corners with a curved screen edge).  It's the vertical direction that's critical, and yes, CRTs do vary in terms of which lines get cut off, as well as how many (most cut around 16 lines, but there's no rule here).
<br />
<br />You know, in light of this discussion, I finally realize why my cable box has a "screen position" configuration which changes where on screen the menus and program guide are displayed (as if it mattered).

<br />
<br />One solution would be for the boot ROM to contain just enough code to read a ROM image off of a fixed location on the CF card.  The loaded ROM would contain the file browser, game ROM loader, game save loader, Game Genie code support, etc.
<br />
<br />That way it is extremely easy to upgrade the multi-game menu, as everything except for basic booting and FAT32, could be loaded from CF.  Basic booting and FAT32 most likely won't need to be changed, while people will definitely want to change and customize the multi-game menu.

<br />This is an excellent idea! Would it be possible to use some of the RAM in the cart to hold the code for all this stuff, loaded from the CF card? I really hope it is, 'cause I loved the idea! I just want to get the best out of the PowerPak, in spite of not having a CopyNES...

<br />Apparently I didnt explain the code modules very well.  The boot rom basically does just load up a 1KB module from the POWERPAK dir into internal NES ram.  The logo screen is one module, .nes display is another module, options screen is another, loading the game is a module, etc.  Modules could load more code from the card into the PowerPak wram or prgram.  Boot rom holds all the code for game genie decoding, file system processing, copying strings to the screen, etc but your module doesnt have to use those.  You could even replace the first intro screen with your own code and never use the boot rom again except for nmi (if you feel like writing your own fat handling).
<br />
<br />CopyNES should really never be needed, just if there is some major bug like card handling corrupts data.  No that should never happen because no fat table writing is ever done...  You should get a CopyNES anyways to use my other ram cart!

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Ahh, so that's what you were referring to when talking about modules.  Makes perfect sense now.  As long as the boot ROM always works to the point of the first module beginning execution, there's no way we'll ever have to worry about a boot ROM update, as it can be completely removed from the system (so to speak) afterwards if it ever comes to that.
<br />
<br />And no, I'm not going to ask for FAT12.

<br />You're in luck. In practice, FAT12 isn't used for volumes bigger than 16 MB. The smallest CF card you can buy nowadays is 256 MB.

<br />Original plan was to have sample mapper files (code module asm and xilinx ise files) so people could develop their own.  I wasn't expecting for people to want to change the game menus so I will have to figure out how to document that well.  Both are in the "later" time frame, definitely not when everything is first available next week.  Any part of the documentation pretty much has to show how the whole thing works, so there is no way to protect against someone copying parts or everything.  It can all be reverse engineered anyways but that would not be fun...
