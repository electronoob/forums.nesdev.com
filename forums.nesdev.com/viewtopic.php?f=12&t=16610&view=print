		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I've been looking at Game Boy stuff lately, and I noticed that most Super Game Boy-enhanced games send one or two standard sequences of DATA_SND command packets (the SGB command to transfer up to 11 bytes to an arbitrary SNES address) at startup when they detect they are running on a SGB. The payloads of these standard packets looked a lot like 65816 code to me, so <a href="https://tcrf.net/Notes:Super_Game_Boy#DATA_SND" class="postlink">I put them together and disassembled them</a>. Interesting.<br /><br />If anyone has reverse-engineered the SGB firmware sufficiently to tell what these apparent hotpatches are for, or is interested in doing so, I'd be interested in your findings. The first one appears to be sprite-related--$7EC000 is where the SGB has its shadow OAM. Maybe it's related to the SGB sprite functionality which was never used by any official game?

This game makes pretty nice use of the SGB sound functions: when run on a SGB, it uses the SNES hardware to play all its background music, and only uses the GB hardware to play sound effects.<br /><br />On a related note (SGB features that are rarely/never used) there's a blog that claims that <em>Mario's Picross</em> uses SNES sprites on its title screen, but it turns out it's actually just displaying a border that intrudes into the GB screen area.

Only SGBv2 and SGB2v1 do have it.<br /><br />I've found a few more games that contain the SOU_TRN patch/packets (but don't know if they are actually using the patch) (and there are probably many more games, I don't have a complete collection of all SGB titles).<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">Searching for: 0BADC202C909D01AA9018D<br />&nbsp; A Bug's Life (THQ 1998)<br />&nbsp; Animaniacs (Factor 5/Konami 1995)<br />&nbsp; Asteroids/Missile Command (1995)<br />&nbsp; Centipede (1995)<br />&nbsp; FIFA 98 (France 98) (THQ 1997)<br />&nbsp; Olympic Summer Games (Atlanta 96) (found patch twice in there, at two different rom offsets)<br />&nbsp; Small Soldiers (THQ 1998)</div><br />Searching was done using TextPad: Search --&gt; Find in Files --&gt; select Condition=Hex, File Type=Binary, specifiy a folder, and filename(s), eg. &quot;*.*&quot; or &quot;*.gmb *.sgb *.cgb&quot; etc. And, enter/paste the search expression, using old TextPad version from 1998, that's having some bugs/obstacles: Spaces between bytes aren't allowed (ie. 0BAD works, but 0B AD doesn't), and byte 00 is treated as EndOfLine (=ignoring all following bytes in the search expression, giving lots of false matches).<br /><br />Btw. another SGB mystery would be the SGB Commander controller. I suspect that it's sending some sort of button-combos for the special functions, and it might have a nonstandard controller ID when in SGB mode. But so far nobody seems to have exeamined if it's really having such special features &amp; how they work exactly.

I've tried to enter that button sequence a dozen of times some years ago, but never got it working.<br />Is it really possible to enter the sequence manually? Or, when saying &quot;has to be entered extremely fast&quot;, did you mean that one would have to enter it at 50Hz/60Hz joypad reading rate?<br /><br />And the SGB Commander joypad. I guess in &quot;SFC&quot; mode it's working just as normal, ie. the Y-button working as such. And in &quot;SGB&quot; mode it's issuing the above L,R,R,L,L,R sequence at that extremly fast rate when pressing Y-button?<br /><br />Would be cool if you could verify the controller ID, especially with the joypad switched to &quot;SGB&quot; mode.

Seeing the visible errors produced could help us understand the reasoning for the patches.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">there's a blog that claims that Mario's Picross uses SNES sprites on its title screen, but it turns out it's actually just displaying a border that intrudes into the GB screen area.</div><br /><br />... wow, and here I thought that was the only game to use that command. So does that mean the SNES sprite functionality went completely unused? That's a real shame.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">And the SGB Commander joypad. I guess in &quot;SFC&quot; mode it's working just as normal, ie. the Y-button working as such. And in &quot;SGB&quot; mode it's issuing the above L,R,R,L,L,R sequence at that extremly fast rate when pressing Y-button?</div><br /><br />The SGB Commander's special buttons basically send an extremely fast, super-human speed sequence of standard SNES controller button presses that trigger the functionality. You wouldn't be able to do it yourself by hand, as far as I recall. They seem to have been meant to sell an expensive (even to this day) additional controller.
