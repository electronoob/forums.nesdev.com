Play World 1 until you beat the first fortress, then move Mario on the World 1 map onto the spade icon and press A. Look at the huge honkin' mushroom, flower, and star &quot;sprites&quot;, except they're not really sprites but actually background elements.<br /><br />Have you played any of the later <em>Mega Man</em> games? Look at the huge minibosses and how they move around at a different rate from the ground. They're backgrounds too.<br /><br />Do you still not understand? If not, it may take me a while (possibly days with my other obligations) to produce an animation that shows dozens of frames of both the screen and the video memory in parallel.<br /><br />EDIT: Is this how smooth it must be?

Does this mean that you will have a much more limited choice of colors for the game blocks? My other concern is what will happen when game blocks get joined together. Won't there be problems with the attributes?

It means the area to the left and right side of the grid has to be a solid color. Do I need to make you a second animation showing what's going on in the video memory?<br /><br />@Drag<br />There are only three velocities: 2, 4, and 6. I'd like to see what situation you think would require three blocks to be drawn as sprites instead of as a background (static images OK; you don't have to animate it).

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Sorry for the late post, but I have a question.<br /><br />In Tepple's example, I can see what he's trying to do.  My question is, how will it be possible to have the white outline to be completely solid when the background scrolls?  In most situations, this would make the background scroll upwards as well, since you're just moving a 'slice' of the image.  How can you have a background scroll in the middle of something without the white moving around?  I'm assuming you're going to try to create &quot;embedded&quot; scrolling, which might have some artifacts that can be hidden with sprites.  About the best way I can describe it would be the segments where you're walking around in bushes in Ultima IV; the entire screen is blackened except for a small area, and that area has black squares potentially hiding the artifacting.  This is a contrast from SMB3's or Metal Gear's method of &quot;walking in the shadows&quot;, since those just have the character move in a fixed screen, while Ultima IV has the entire screen scroll.<br /><br />If my question doesn't make sense, it's because I don't know how to word it.

But then I acknowledge that Drag's counterexample makes this technique slightly less reliable.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Thanks for all the comments and suggestions! I've been recently very busy with work.<br /><br />I initially considered smoother animation (also with sprites), but when I got the first 32px animation version working (almost same as now), I really liked how fast the gameplay was compared to Cirulli's and Veewo's originals. The 32px move animations can take as low as 1-4 frames depending how far tiles move. This short animation delay really accelerates the game and makes overall playtime shorter.

I guess the options are[...]<br /></div>There's a goofy option to increase the total bandwidth: fully unrolled loops of PLA/STA $2007 with stack haxery and using zeropage LDA $80/STA $2007/LDA $81[...] to store the entire tilemap. Since you're not using sprites (right?), this gives you enough off-screen time to schedule 324 writes during vblank, and you &quot;only&quot; need 312 ((16+2)×16 (nametables) +(4+2)×4 (attribute tables)) to update the entire display every frame. Using both techniques to update the entirety in a single vblank will take 272 bytes of RAM from zero page and stack, 1592-1800 (depending on how much is store in the stack and how much is stored in zero page) bytes of ROM and will complete the entire set of writes in 2144 cycles (out of ≈2260).</div><br /><br />Interesting idea. Notice that the current code already has following trick to draw a single 128x8 tiles &quot;slice&quot; with only 4 reads:<br /><br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">; pseudo of 32x8 tile row write<br />LDA #&lt;ppu addr hi&gt;<br />STA $2006<br />LDA #&lt;ppu addr lo&gt;<br />STA $2006<br />.REPEAT 4<br />LDY tile_rows, X<br />INX<br />STY $2007<br />INY<br />STY $2007<br />INY<br />STY $2007<br />INY<br />STY $2007<br />.ENDREPEAT<br /></div><br /><br />This works because the tile graphics are pre-arranged. This means we'd only need 25% of RAM you calculated -- so we can even attempt to unroll everything into RAM! The above 128x8 slice code would become:<br /><br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">; 128x8 slice unrolled to RAM<br />LDA #&lt;ppu addr hi&gt; ; 2<br />STA $2006 ; 3<br />LDA #&lt;ppu addr lo&gt; ; 2<br />STA $2006 ; 3<br />.REPEAT 4<br />LDY #&lt;tile character table idx&gt; ; 2<br />STY $2007 ; 3<br />INY ; 1<br />STY $2007 ; 3<br />INY ; 1<br />STY $2007 ; 3<br />INY ; 1<br />STY $2007 ; 3<br />.ENDREPEAT<br />; total: 10+4*(2+4*3+3*1)=78 bytes<br /></div><br /><br />The unrolling would need 4*4*78=1248 bytes total which *might* work... Hmm, however, I think the 'PLA/STA $2007' idea is better since it'd only need 16*4=64 bytes of stack, and the code could be in ROM:<br /><br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">; 128x8 slice 'PLA/STA $2007' version<br />SET_PPU_ADDR &lt;row ppu addr&gt;<br />.REPEAT 4<br />PLA<br />TAY<br />STY $2007<br />INY<br />STY $2007<br />INY<br />STY $2007<br />INY<br />STY $2007<br />.ENDREPEAT<br /></div><br /><br />...I however have no plan to implement this -- conside this just an intellectual exercise <img src="./images/smilies/icon_cool.gif" alt="8-)" title="Cool" /><br /><br />EDIT: If you wish to try this, the code is in bitbucket...

I forgot to make one myself <img src="./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /><br /><br />There may be multiple good strategies in the game, but I use similar as Bregalad. I try position the biggest tile to any of the corners. Then I merge the tiles on either of its sides in ascending order, so as to create kind of &quot;merging pipeline&quot;. Worst case is when a new tile pops in the wrong place and I'm forced to move the tiles in an unwanted direction, breaking the &quot;pipeline&quot;. This however makes the puzzle aspect of the game to stand out, as the &quot;pipeline&quot; or tile positioning must be redone.<br /><br />Based on my observations after getting '1024' you really need good luck to win as a single tile can ruin the game. This is one of the reasons why I wanted to make the gameplay faster, as then you can retry (and lose <img src="./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" />) faster.<br /><br />Has anyone got '<strong>4096</strong>' yet? I was quite close once.<br /><br /><br /><strong>PS.</strong> Probability for &quot;4&quot; tile in the game is around 10% (as in the original by Cerulli). More precisely it's floor(255/10)/255 = <strong>9.8%</strong>.
