Id=2062731</a><!-- m --><br /><br />I've used a desoldering iron like that to remove through hole ICs and other components many times, it works great. It's actually really easy. The only thing, those older SNES boards (with the solder plugged vias - like NES boards) can be hard to desolder things from. The reason being is that if you take a look and compare one with a later cart you'll notice that the later cart has actual solder pads for the IC connections where as the older ones don't. They just have vias, so the leg of an IC is soldering all in the via, and not just on the pad, making it a harder to desolder. A lot of times with this  you wont be able to suck out all the solder the first time, in which case you have to resolder and try again. And the normal caveats apply with soldering. So yeah, practice desoldering the lockout chip from NES carts until you get it down so you don't ruin your EVO cart.<br /><br />You could also try a combination of the desoldering iron as well as a desolder braid (one that has flux in it will work a lot better). But you definitely didn't have to cut the board up to get that MAD-1 out. It would have taken longer to heat the desoldering iron up than it would have to actually remove it with one.

The overall pinout looks identical to MAD-1/MAD-R, but with two extra pins (pin 9 and 10) at the &quot;bottom&quot; side. That extra pins should be equivalent to the 74HCU04 inverter on other DSPn carts, ie. Pin9=OSC input, and Pin10=amplified/inverted /OSC output.<br /><br />Pin1=A22 and Pin18=A22 doesn't make sense. On PCB photo MAD2.Pin1 seems to go to U2.Pin31, ie. /CS for the second ROM. The MAD2.Pin18 connection isn't visible, but I would expect to connect to U1.Pin31, ie. /CS for first ROM.<br /><br />Pin7=?, seems to come from the battery (via the R1 resistor), so it could be called Vbat, or Vin or whatever you prefer.<br /><br />Pin11=SRAM /A13. Hmmmm, isn't that an 8Kbyte SRAM (with only 13 address lines, A0..A12)? If the chip is following the MAD-1/MAD-R pinouts, then MAD2.Pin11 should be /RESET, ie. cartridge slot Pin26. Can you check that?<br /><br />Pin12=Vcc is probaby the HiROM/LoROM mode select pin (at least it's so on MAD-1/MAD-R), so Pin12=Vcc would select HiROM mode, which looks right.<br /><br />Pin14,15,16=BA6,BA4,A14 (aka A22,A20,A14 in 24bit address bus notation) looks right, A22+A14 are common wiring for MAD with HiROM. And A20 does match for the ROM size (1Mbyte in U1, plus 512Kbyte in U2) of the Drift King 2 cart.<br /><br />Pin17=A19 (ROM U1 &amp; ROM U2), theoretically, MAD2.Pin17 should be A13 (SNES cart pin38). Of course that address line would also connect to the ROM chips, but I think it should be A13, not A19 (at least, mapping SRAM to address 6000h should require A13+A14 connected to the MAD2).<br /><br />Pin4=DSP1B  /D4. Huh, I can't imagine if/how/why the MAD2 could connect to the databus.<br />On MAD-1, Pin4 would be /CS (for single ROMs, ie. it would be left unused in carts with two ROMs).<br />On MAD-R, Pin4 would RESET output (=inverse of /RESET input), this would actually make sense here, since DSP1 requires RESET (active high), and DSP1B does probably require it the same way. If so, then MAD2.Pin4 should go to DSP1B.Pin16 (?)

Because of my lack of focus, I think must have looked at the 36 pin maskrom pinout once or twice instead of the 32 pin one while checking pin-out on Caitsith's website. That explain the mix-up with pin 1, 17 and 18. I was also not looking at the right pinout for the SRAM and was using the 256kbit ram pinout instead of the 6265 for some reason.
