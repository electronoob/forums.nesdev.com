		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Hey all, I've something that I think this community would be interested in seeing. Since I was a kid, I've loved craftwork. Making things out of wood, homemade christmas ornaments, that sort of thing. For about a year now, I've taken up a sort of unusual hobby. How could I combine my love of craftwork with my other favorite hobby - ratro gaming? The answer: fuse beads.
<br />
<br />Fuse beads, a simple craft meant for children to create simple shapes, is based on a grid format, just as pixels are in sprites. Doing some guesswork originally, then finally getting serious with actual spritesheets, I've since made many sprites.
<br />
<br />As most of you guys already know, I'm a huge Rockman fan, almost bordering an obsession. I'd like to show you guys what I've made! I literally have hundreds of beadsprites. I'm posting here on this board because these are all classic gaming related and probably gets more traffic.
<br />
<br />Unlike most spriters, I've gone to great lengths to make sure that my sprites adhere to the NES color pallet as closely as possible in general (meaning they are never miscolored) but I also adhere to their original full-color designs, and recolor the sprites to match what they would look in in artwork as opposed to the limited amount of colors the NES could produce for them. You'll see what I mean as I post my works.
<br />
<br />So anyway, without further ado, here's my sprite works! All items are for sale and I do offer  commission work for custom orders. I take pride in what I do, so any orders placed with be met with the highest standards complete with backing for extra strength. magnets are also optional to put these on any fridge. This isn't a sale thread though - just something to show off my hundred of works, a few a time not to overwhelm you though! 
<br />

<br />
<br />This is a series of various sprites. You've got a series of Tetris blocks, Bub from Bobble Bobble, Shantae from one of the GBC's best games of the same name, a custom made Zero Suit 8-bit Samus, Luigi, a ? Block and a Koopa troopa from SMB1, DigDug, The Wizard from my favorite childhood C64 game, and finally a bead sprite Famicom.
<br />
<br /><img src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5061/5694202933_3c42bbe7dc_z.jpg" alt="Image" />
<br />
<br />
<br />Various sprites. The bottom right sprite is suppose to be Super Joe in Megaman sprite style, but it actually ends up looking more like Tomonobu Itagaki. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_cool.gif" alt="8)" title="Cool" />
<br />
<br />
<br /><a href="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3468/3232724071_29bc3e7f06_b.jpg" class="postlink"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3468/3232724071_29bc3e7f06.jpg" alt="Image" /></a>
<br />
<br />Bosses from Megaman 1. From left to right and top to bottom: Dr. Light, Rush, Protoman, Megaman, Roll, Cutman, Gutsman, Iceman, Bombman, Fireman, Elecman. Oilman and Timeman are missing as I don't have any sprites for them. Can someone here help?
<br />
<br /><a href="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3483/3232724349_9b64371abf_b.jpg" class="postlink"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3483/3232724349_9b64371abf.jpg" alt="Image" /></a>
<br />
<br />Bosses from Megaman 2. From left to right and top to bottom: Metalman, Airman, Bubbleman, Quickman, Crashman, Flashman, Heatman, Woodman. Flashman, Crashman, and Bubbleman have been color enhanced beyond the capabilities of the NES color pallet. I based their proper colors on official character artwork. 
<br />
<br /><a href="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3476/3233574666_7a555c6204_b.jpg" class="postlink"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3476/3233574666_7a555c6204.jpg" alt="Image" /></a>
<br />
<br />Bosses from Megaman 3. From left to right and top to bottom: Needleman, Magnetman, Geminiman, Hardman, Topman, Snakeman, Sparkman, Shadowman. Snakeman has been color enhanced slightly by adding the red snake eyes he should have.
<br />
<br /><a href="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3301/3232724975_8a7805da02_b.jpg" class="postlink"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3301/3232724975_8a7805da02.jpg" alt="Image" /></a>
<br />
<br />Bosses from Megaman 4. From left to right and top to bottom: Brightman, Toadman, Drillman, Pharaohman, Ringman, Dustman, Diveman, Skullman.
<br />
<br /><a href="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3320/3232725427_0ed78d0ab1_b.jpg" class="postlink"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3320/3232725427_0ed78d0ab1.jpg" alt="Image" /></a>
<br />
<br />Bosses from Megaman 5. From left to right and top to bottom: Gravityman, Waveman, Stoneman, Gyroman, Starman, Chargeman, Napalmman, Crystalman.
<br />Note that all these sprites have all been color enhanced beyond the capabilities of the NES color pallet. I based their proper colors on official character artwork. 
<br />
<br /><a href="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3500/3233575924_b2b55b4ce3_b.jpg" class="postlink"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3500/3233575924_b2b55b4ce3.jpg" alt="Image" /></a>
<br />
<br />Bosses from Megaman 6. From left to right and top to bottom: Blizzardman, Centaurman, Flameman, Knightman, Plantman, Windman, Tomahawkman, Yamatoman. 
<br />Again, note that these sprites have all been color enhanced beyond the capabilities of the NES color pallet. I based their proper colors on official character artwork.

<br />
<br />Bosses from Megaman 7 FC. From left to right and top to bottom: Freezeman, Junkman, Burstman, Cloudman, Springman, Slashman, Shademan, Turboman. 
<br />Note that these sprites have all been color enhanced beyond the capabilities of the NES color pallet. I based their proper colors on third 16-bit sprites as well as official character artwork. 
<br />
<br /><a href="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3080/3233576572_93137e9284_b.jpg" class="postlink"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3080/3233576572_93137e9284.jpg" alt="Image" /></a>
<br />
<br />Bosses from Megaman 8 FC. From left to right and top to bottom: Tanguman, Astroman, Swordman, Clownman, Searchman, Frostman, Gernademan, Aquaman.
<br />Note that these sprites have all been color enhanced beyond the capabilities of the NES color pallet. I based their proper colors on official character artwork. 
<br />
<br /><a href="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3112/3232727045_05cc2cc9cb_b.jpg" class="postlink"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3112/3232727045_05cc2cc9cb.jpg" alt="Image" /></a>
<br />
<br />Bosses from Megaman 9. From left to right and top to bottom: Concreteman, Tornadoman, Splashwoman, Plugman, Jewelman, Magmaman, Hornetman, Galaxyman.
<br />Note that these sprites have all been color enhanced beyond the capabilities of the NES color pallet. I based their proper colors on official character artwork. 
<br />

<br />
<br />"<em>I'm too sexy for 16-bit!</em> I made this Splashwoman sprite  <em>before</em> Megaman 9 even came out! I just based it on screenshots!

<br />
<br />Sigma from Megaman Xtreme 1, color corrected to match his 16-bit sprite From MMX1.
<br />
<br /><img src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5310/5694202457_58c70f0c40_z.jpg" alt="Image" />
<br />
<br />More various sprites. This Link was actually from a stitch pattern for a pillow. Samus is from the Japanese FDS version of Metroid's save management system, Super Joe for Bionic Commando, and Sonic from Sonic the Hedgehog for the Gamegear. Sonic is too yellow for his own good, but it was done on a whim.  
<br />
<br /><img src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5142/5694775706_b02e55b8b0.jpg" alt="Image" />
<br />
<br />My first true 16-bit sprite, Terra Branford, the main character and heroine of the SNES classic, Final Fantasy VI. 
<br />
<br />A tribute to the awesome community devoted to the Famicom

<br />
<br />They're small, tubelike beeds that you stick on a sheet with little tips that hold them on there.
<br />If you want to stick them together permanently without using the sheet, you can take your iron and melt one side of the whole beed-picture so that the plastic that these beeds are made out of melts and sticks together.
<br />You can take it of the sheet the and do whatever with it...I have seen people who put them on their walls or even make Christmas decorations out of them.
<br />
<br />I should still have quite a few of these beeds back in Germany, but I haven't done anything with them in ages. Remaking sprites with them is an awesome idea!
<br />
<br />Edit:
<br />Gotta love MissingNo. :3

<br />
<br />Lastly, here's a set I'm sure you guys will love. Mario here is color enhanced, and the game cart is there for scale, though it looks like Bowser wants to burn it up! <img src="./images/smilies/icon_twisted.gif" alt=":twisted:" title="Twisted Evil" />

<br />
<br />I dunno how much you charge for these things, but I'd *love* a set of all of the characters from Wai Wai World / Konami World (#1, not #2).  As well as all the characters in Parodius.  :D

Prices start at just $5, but they vary depending on what you want, complexity, size, etc.
