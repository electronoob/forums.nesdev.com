		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Trying to get an idea on the question: which kind of a mapper is best for homebrew projects, when there are no special requirements on its features and it is only used to extend PRG and CHR?
<br />
<br />MMC1 seems to be popular choice, but it is slow, and complex - requires to salvage the chip from original games, or use a programmable logic chip. So it seems to have more drawbacks than benefits.
<br />
<br />UxROM, AxROM, BNROM all allow to extend PRG and use CHR RAM, which has its benefits - no need in complex hardware, only one ROM chip needs to be programmed. It limits CHR bankswitch freedom, though (not very important, I think), and I'm not really sure if replacing a ROM chip with a SRAM chip is more or less expensive.
<br />
<br />Not sure if there a discrete logic mapper that allows to bankswitch both PRG and CHR. It is possible to make a cheap mapper that does that, I think, but existing mappers are generally better because they are supported everywhere.
<br />
<br />Any thoughts?

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />MMC1 games are a few buck each for cart case+PCB+mapper, I'll just leave it there. It might be complex, but it's still cheap and easy to use.
<br />
<br />I myself love MMC3 despite never using it, it just has so much to mess with. I've used MMC1 in a project and it was easy to get going and nice, but I don't like it a ton as it's too simple. I do like being able to have 32KB RAM though donors. I love CHR-RAM on a mapper. If it existed, I'd probably experiment with a UNROM setup with a extra C*ROM touch of switchable CHR-ROM. That way it's cheap to make with logic chips and flexible for animations and such.
<br />
<br />So, my mappers of choice for games would probably go: MMC3,UNROM+32KB CHR-RAM, MMC1, UNROM, NROM. It all depends on the size of the project, the first named mappers being my preferred for big projects going to smaller games. For a spin off project that I'll only make one cart of, I'll go a nice MMC1+SRAM+CHR-RAM to keep it simple and expand it to my hearts desire.

<br />
<br />Advantages:
<br />- 32k pages means you have a lot of freedom laying out the data in each page.
<br />- CHR-RAM makes it easy to store a reasonably large amount of graphics (you can even try compression techniques).
<br />- CHR-RAM makes some amount of CHR animation possible (see: Battletoads).
<br />- CHR-RAM makes some very interesting rendering techniques possible (see: Solstice).
<br />- Very simple to build (just requires one 74161 IC).
<br />- Only need to flash one EPROM, since the other is SRAM.
<br />
<br />Disadvantages:
<br />- Not great for DPCM, since you have to duplicate it across all pages used.
<br />- Can't do large CHR swap animations.
<br />- Doesn't have horizontal or vertical mirroring (but you can switch to BNROM maybe).
<br />
<br />SRAM is only a little bit more expensive than an EPROM for CHR (less than $1.50/chip).

<br />Based on the difference between mapper 0 for NROM and mapper 0 for Family BASIC, it's two extra chips (74HC20 + 6264) and a bypass cap.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I really like the BxROM, for reasons very similar to the ones rainwarrior gave for liking AxROM. BxROM gives you more PRG space than any other discrete mapper, and is incredibly simple to make (requiring only a 74161, just like AxROM). The reason I prefer BxROM over AxROM is because I don't think that the few advantages of 1-screen mirroring are worth the 256KB of PRG you have to sacrifice for it (plus, 1-screen mirroring causes horizontal scrolling glitches).
<br />
<br />Swapping the whole 32KB makes it a bit harder to access data from different banks, but this is not such a big problem once you find the optimal ROM layout for your project.
<br />
<br />CHR-RAM is very versatile, even if you can't modify as many tiles per frame as instantaneous bankswitching of CHR-ROM allows. CHR-RAM makes a lot of sense for homebrews I think, since it can easily mimic the CHR-ROM of NROM, which every newbie is used to, but allows renovation and neat effects in case you want to give it a try.

<br />
<br />
<br />An MMC1 donor is cheaper, but you gotta deal with the karma police for destroying historical artifacts, and also you have to remove the existing chips which is a serious annoyance.
<br />
<br />A repropak/case/lockout, chips and stuff for AxROM will run you about ~$20 per cart (more or less depending on how much you are doing). ~$25 for MMC1 (if it ever comes back) plus probably another $1.50 for WRAM if needed.
<br />
<br />
<br />I'm not going to say I've never destroyed vintage hardware for my own purposes, but if I'm going to make 50 carts of something I will feel a lot easier about using new parts. I'm not going to complain about people who do it (they're your carts, wreck 'em if you want), but I'm saying personally I'd rather not.

<br />Cool. This is great for background animations such as coins spinning, water, and other things that make levels look "alive" (4 frames should be enough for most things). Or for holding more animation frames of the main character (all other tiles are repeated across the 4 banks).
