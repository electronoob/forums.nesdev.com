		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I was able to make my dev-cart (mentioned in a previous post).  The first thing I did was to try my test files.  
<br />
<br />This is what I see in any emulator:
<br /><img src="http://i389.photobucket.com/albums/oo335/banshaku/emu_shot.png" alt="Image" />
<br />
<br />This is the result on the real hadrware:
<br /><img src="http://i389.photobucket.com/albums/oo335/banshaku/on_hardware.jpg" alt="Image" />
<br />
<br />To make sure that my devcart (MMC3 CHR-RAM) is fine I tested the original game (FF3J) and another one that use VRAM (Megaman 6) and both works fine.
<br />
<br />I tried to wait more vblank thinking that could be the cause (the PPU could have not been ready before writing to the pattern table) but without success.
<br />
<br />My question is: what should I check next? What are the probable cause of graphic artifacts on the real hardware but not on emulators?
<br />
<br />As a side note, I saw the impact of the DMC on the joystick data without Blarg's fortified method: once in a while, the character was moving without any input.

<br />You should bankswitch correct bank of CHRRAM into the MMC3.

<br />
<br />So that is my guess too, that the CHR settings on the MMC3 were not initialized properly.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Oh...  I see. I was sure that the CHR-RAM was hardwired directly since 2 Pattern tables is 8k and so is CHR-RAM. It seems I guessed wrong. 
<br />
<br />I moved the test project to CHR-RAM and didn't touch the code for a few months, I didn't see this issue.  Emulators don't reproduce that unknown state for CHR-RAM so I never saw that behavior.  I remember having this issue with PRG-ROM inside the emulator thought.
<br />
<br />I will test it tonight. Thanks everyone.
<br />
<br />By the way, I'm not sure what kind of advantage you could have to switch banks in ram thought. Any commercial games use it for some specific effects?

I never understood why they did that -- as it just seems to encourage bad behavior for homebrewers/rom hackers.<br /><br />I defaulted to zeroing regs in my emu (which would have produced a glitch similar to what you posted) and ran into no problems with any commercial games I tried.

<br />
<br />Lagrange Point comes to mind.  I don't think it does any actual effects with it (like you, I fail to see the point), but I know it relies on that behavior.

<br />Yeah. But they became quite accurate recently so we tend to forget that fact <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />
<br />
<br />I modified the code and set on purpose all CHR-RAM banks to 0 and here's the result:
<br /><img src="http://i389.photobucket.com/albums/oo335/banshaku/all_chrbank_to_0_in_emu.jpg" alt="Image" />
<br />
<br />Quite familiar isn't it. Problem solved. Proper init of the CHR-RAM banks will solve my issue.
<br />
<br />Thanks guys!

<br />
<br />It seems to be that way.  Every time I started my famicom, I always had the same results.  I cannot confirm for PRG-ROM since the banks where set properly. But that could be tested someday. 
<br />
<br />If it's always the same, this should be implemented in the current emulators, making them more accurate.

<br />
<br />I guess what I'm getting at is they should make one up that's less friendly.

<br />
<br />Yes. At least I would have found my bug more easily if it was done that way.
<br />
<br />On another note, I tested on the real hardware and now it's working properly. Problem solved.  
<br />
<br />But we shouldn't take for granted that what I found about "all banks where zero" on hardware is the real behavior yet. Who knows, maybe on different revision of the MMC3 (A, B or C) it could react differently. Nobody seems to know the difference between them. That could be one of the small unnoticeable difference.
