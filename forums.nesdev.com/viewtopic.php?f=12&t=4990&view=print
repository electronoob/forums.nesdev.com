I would like to create a FFV translated reproduction cart but I honestly have no clue where to start. I've never had/used an eprom writer or anything like but If someone could help me out and help me figure out what is needed to create this game I would greatly appreciate it!
<br />
<br />-Thanks

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Yeh, that's one of the things I'm actually alright at. I've taken a class in eletronics but It didn't really cover anything that I'm reading about when it come to making nes/snes reproductions. If I did want to program the eprom myself where can I order them from? I was looking at the Star Ocean guide and I couldn't find a place online that sold 27C322 eproms. I don't know how much eprom burners go for, why type to buy or what the eproms would cost... Would it be better if I just had someone do it for me? 
<br />Who would be someone reliable that someone could suggest?
<br />
<br />-Thanks!

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Oh man, I just started this project. I bought 15 27c801's, 12 27c4001's, and 15 27c020's. The 020's are 256kb and for NES repros, and the 27c4001 ar 512kb and for both, and the 801s are a mb and for snes.
<br />
<br />I wasted 2 eproms by a bad burn, then put them in donor carts (scrapped them after i realized - not worth the 10 or so bucks combined donor cart and eprom to try and take an hour to desolder it again lol).
<br />
<br />Now my problem is that, I wired everything up (didn't scratch PCB, lifted the legs and re-wired), but both my Lufia english (on a copy of  SimEarth) and some other game, dragons lair (on a copy of david crane's amazing tennis) won't work at all. They match up according to sram/hirom/lorom/etc. but wont work on my snes. I tested the eproms by taking them 10 minutes after burning them, and then reading them with the programmer and playing them on an emulator again.. so that's not the problem.
<br />
<br />As the person above me said, soldering it seems to be a bitch.. but then again I am using wires from the inside of a phone cable.. lol. I'll head out to radio shack and buy some actual 18 gauge wire soon.
