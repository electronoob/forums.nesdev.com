<br />
<br />In a community that I am part of, there is a small competition going on recently, that you take a classic adventure game, make sprites and mock-up screens of it, as though the game is made by a different developer on another system. It is a coincidence that NESST was released at the same time and so I decided to give it a go.
<br />
<br />This is what I did:

<br />And, the ROM (with source):

<br />
<br />This is also my first "working" Famicom ROM.  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=":wink:" title="Wink" /> 
<br />(As I'm not really going to do any more work on it, I think this post does not belong to the Homebrew section or a thread of its own; I just cut in to say thanks.)

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Great tool Shiru.  I don't know if you are still taking feature requests, but here are some features I'd like:
<br />
<br />Pattern/CHR:
<br />
<br />-saving/loading of .CHR files of variable size &lt;4k.  I use CHR-RAM and I group my tiles/sprites into variable-sized chr blocks.  For example, a single enemy sprite with all animation frames would have its own .chr file.  I'd like to be able to drag a box around some tiles and save only those tiles to a .CHR file.  Likewise I'd like to be able to load these .CHR files.  For example if I have a .CHR file that holds 18 tiles, opening the file would load those 18 tiles into the editor starting from the currently selected tile in the tileset.
<br />
<br />-use CTRL+click to add individual tiles to the selection.  Shift-drag can only make a perfect rectangle selection.  I'd like to be able to add stray tiles to that selection (for saving).
<br />
<br />-a command to toggle the tiles to and from 8x16 sprite format.  TileMolester calls this "row-interleaved".  8x16 sprites are vertical, but they must be stored horizontally (top half $00, bottom half $01 for example).  It would be nice to be able to draw the sprites as they appear in-game (vertical), and then press a button to remap them to how the NES expects them to be stored:
<br />
<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">|----|----|<br />| A&nbsp; | B&nbsp; |<br />|----|----|<br />| C&nbsp; | D&nbsp; |<br />|----|----|<br /><br />becomes:<br /><br />|----|----|----|----|<br />| A&nbsp; | C&nbsp; | B&nbsp; | D&nbsp; |<br />|----|----|----|----|</div>
<br />
<br />-ability to edit more than one 8x8 tile at a time.  Maybe have the CHR editor be the size of the current rectangle selection?
<br />
<br />Palettes:
<br />
<br />-hovering over a palette will display help text at the bottom telling you which color is which.  Right now it is ambiguous which of the 4 colors in a palette are color 0, 1, 2 or 3.

<br />Other requested features are relatively minor, I'll add them a little later.

<br />Why don't you simply use YY-CHR? It can display tiles in several different layouts (including 8x16). As I understand it, this is still primarily a nametable editor, and feature creep is to be avoided.
<br />
<br />Btw, I would love to see a proper sprite/animation editor (a separate tool) if anybody is up to the task. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /> Something where you can load a CHR file, build animation frames out of the tiles and export to some (maybe customizable) format. It could also import and optimize (remove duplicate tiles etc) a image file (with all of the frames), generating the CHR data and sprite layout data.

<br />Output formats should be as customizable as possible. In the case of sprite definitions, there are a few things I consider important:
<br />
<br />1. the possibility to define an origin point for each frame, so that all coordinates are relative to that point;
<br />
<br />2. selection between grid-based or sprite-based frames. The second option is good for complex frames which are not perfect rectangles or make use of sprite layering;
<br />
<br />3. the option to select which fields are exported, and in which order. The selectable fields are things like: X and Y dimensions, X and Y offsets, tile index, attributes (palette, priority and flipping), number of sprites used, things like that.
<br />
<br />IMO, this is one of those things that are hard to make right, like level editors. Every programmer has their own way of working, and it's hard to make a tool that will fit all.

<br />
<br />-Have the nametable grid show attribute borders.   The grid is crowded already, but you could make just the corners of attribute blocks look a little different.  Or have a separate attribute grid that could be turned off and on like the other grids.  Today I was trying to find an optimal place to draw a text box to the screen and I had to strain my eyes a bit and touch the screen with my fingers to find a place where the corners of the textbox would line up right with the attributes.

<br />
<br />New features are most of suggested earlier plus few bugfixes. Some of these are:
<br />
<br />- V and Ctrl+V in the CHR editor were conflicting
<br />- Load CHRs of any size of multiple of 16 (below 4K, of course)
<br />- Palettes reorganized and has text hint for colors and entries
<br />- Separate grids for tiles, attributes, blocks
<br />- Forced extension for CHR save (previously it was possible to save something without extension)
<br />- RLE packer had a bug, last attribute byte was always lost
<br />- You can use Caps Lock to keep selection mode on
<br />- You can select random tiles in the tileset using Ctrl and left/right click
<br />- You can copy random selected tiles as sequence of tiles
<br />- You can save selected tiles into a file
<br />- If you trying to overwrite a CHR file, and it has different size, a warning shown
<br />- Interleaving/deinterleaving of CHR data (for 8x16 sprites)
<br />- Now you can see parts of neighborn tiles in the CHR editor and move to them by clicking on the edges (not as good as could be, but makes editing a bit easier)
