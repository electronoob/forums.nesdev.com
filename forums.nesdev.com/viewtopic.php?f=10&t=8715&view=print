		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Hi Guys!
<br />
<br />Have been reading alot of 'project' topics and pics of carts that are finish and that rly gets me exited to start my own projects in the future!
<br />
<br />But before I can do that, I want to start small....
<br />
<br />I want to burn roms to EPROM's and place it on a PCB. To do that i would need:
<br />
<br />
<br />Willem EPROM Programmer PCB50B OR PRG-055 True-USB PRO GQ-4X Willem Programmer Light Pack
<br />(I prefer USB because windows 7 support and no old ports..)
<br />
<br />EPROM Eraser
<br />15watt soldering Iron
<br />45watt DE soldering iron
<br />
<br />
<br />27c010 Eprom
<br />32KB Games on: 27C256
<br />
<br />
<br />Is this correct? I have some double carts that i can use as donor carts like: SMB 2, gauntlet II and excite bike) 
<br />I have some more, will list them later for comptabiliteit.
<br />
<br />
<br />I want to start small, like open a cart, desolder the pins, get the EPROM out and put it back in. (I have no soldering experience, so i need some practise...)
<br />
<br />After I get the hang of it i will order a 27C256 EPROM and burn a 32K game on it.
<br />
<br />Is it correct that I need the same board as the 'original' game? And that if its just 32K I dont need to do any rewirering.
<br />
<br />Like:
<br />1943                            128k PRG / 0k CHR       H       UNROM (2)
<br />
<br />If i have a donor cart like:
<br />
<br />Ducktales			128k PRG / 0k CHR	V	UNROM (2)
<br />
<br />All i need to do is change the EPROM, right?
<br />
<br />
<br />If this is correct this will be my start project, but I would like to know if the above is correct and the equipement is correct as well.
<br />
<br />Thank you!
<br />
<br />Greetings, Marcel

<br />
<br />Hey Marcel,
<br />
<br />I'm a little confused by the question "And that if its just 32K I dont need to do any rewirering."  After that you go on to use examples like Ducktales and 1943.  For both of those games, you will definitely require rewiring, and you want to make sure you burn a game that uses their mappers to the board.
<br />
<br />I assume by "32K" you may mean any game that runs without a mapper, which would be considered NROM or Mapper 0 in the iNES format.  The most popular example there would be Super Mario Bros.  And for any of those games, I believe, there is no re-wiring required.  So for example you should be able to burn Dig Dug II's PRG data to a 32K chip, burn it's CHR data to an 8K chip, and then solder them on a board out of an SMB donor without any rewiring.  (Somebody please correct me if any of that's wrong.)
<br />
<br />If you would like more examples of games you could burn to a simple NROM donor, here's a search I did on Bootgod's database that shows all NROM games.  <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://bootgod.dyndns.org:7777/search.php?keywords=&amp;ines=0&amp;ines_op==%60@%60&amp;offset=0&amp;field=2&amp;order=asc">http://bootgod.dyndns.org:7777/search.p ... &amp;order=asc</a><!-- m -->
<br />
<br />Also, before burning, you need to make sure you remove the iNES header from the ROM file, which is the first sixteen bytes.  Just open the ROM in a hex editor, delete the first sixteen bytes, and re-save it.  I think that should make it good to burn.
