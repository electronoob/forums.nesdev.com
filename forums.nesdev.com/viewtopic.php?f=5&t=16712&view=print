		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I've been using the official Nintendo Famicom-to-NES converter found in some of the old cartridges. But there's a tendency that it doesn't work. Even worse than regular cartridges.<br /><br />So, what is a good way to play Famicom cartridges on an NES?<br />Is there a converter that also takes into account the lockout chip? (Cheap converters on eBay don't do it, so you either have to disable your lockout chip or use a top loader NES.)<br /><br />Or is there a way to make that Nintendo converter more stable?

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I guess it has mostly to do with the fact that this is not a cartridge, but a simple connector, so the position in the slot is not as &quot;absolute&quot; as with a cartridge in a real shell. You have to wiggle it around a lot, put it back out and in again, try it again etc. Just like with real cartridges, only worse.<br /><br />It has nothing to do with dirt. The above part with the Famicom cartridge isn't the culprit anyway. And the below part that you put into the NES is totally clean.<br /><br />It's not based on any specific Famicom game where one would work better than the other. It's the lower part of the converter.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Allright, so what you essentially need to improve that method is a case that keeps the connection snug and exact. Getting a shell from INL or somewhere else and cutting it in half should at least provide stability in the nes-facing end. Maybe a strap for keeping the cart tight, too?<br /><br />If it were me, i'd dump the FC carts, put them on repro boards or a memory card loader cart, and let the originals collect dust on the shelf.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Possible the reason you have a harder time working is there are twice as many pins that need to be cleaned and making good contact when using pin adapters.  Statistically, it's twice as unlikely to have a good connection.  On top of that is the issue with front loaders and larger adapters/FCcarts that don't allow you to press down fully.<br /><br />I made a batch of 60 to 72pin converters that also properly route expansion audio to EXP6, and properly handle mirroring which are features typically lacking from other converters on the market.  I wanted to have them listed for sale by now, but have been a bit busy to make updates to the site.  Also have some details to work through in regards to a removal string/ribbon.  Anyway, if you're interested in trying an early version out I could give you a deal on one.

For larger famicom carts like MMC5/VRC7 you won't be able to press down.  If you remove the metal bar from your front loader the FC cart joint will permit some bending that may allow it to be pressed down fully.

I was disappointed how nearly every other adapter on the market doesn't properly handle mirroring, nor support expansion audio.  So supporting those features became my primary goal, the sawed off case is simply the only manufacturable solution available to me.  Investing thousands in a dedicated injection mold is cost prohibitive.  <br /><br />I do have a 3D printer, but it can't do much better than a sawed off case.  Although perhaps a 3d printed part would be good for closing off the open air end of the cart.  I'm working on acquiring a laser cutter, but I don't see much for additional options it would allow for this product.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">infiniteneslives wrote:<br />Also have some details to work through in regards to a removal string/ribbon.<br /><br />Will it work without a removal ribbon anyway?

Keep in mind the FC connector will be nice and tight at first, but how loose will it get over years of use..?  A string/ribbon is a small amount of insurance to pay for things not going as planned and then requiring one to have alien like fingers to remove the adapter, or disassemble their NES to get the adapter back out again.
