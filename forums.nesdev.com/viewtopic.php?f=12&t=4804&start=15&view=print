<br />I have to be honest here, I never actually tried to port a NES game to SNES, I just believe that this should at least execute the code correctly. I'd imagine that the biggest gripe would be adapting NES raster code to work correctly.
<br />A total rewrite of these using HDMA would probably be the way to go here. The SNES doesn't have hardware sprite/bg collision detection built-in, so you'd have a hard time directly porting that kind of code, anyway.
<br />
<br />For Sprite 0 hits, Disch gave me a little ASM example using IRQ in place of Sprite 0. It uses one RAM byte in $B8 (and include $B9 if 16 bit)
<br />
<br />In NMI:
<br />set $B8 to #$00, change Sprite 0 hit detection from STA $2002 to STA $B8 then make IRQ Init code, now redirect to the main NMI stuff with RTI at the end
<br />
<br />In IRQ: 
<br />set $B8 to #$40, then disable/acknowlage IRQ. RTI it

<br />Has anyone ported a NES game before? I would imagine it would be really difficult as you would have to re-write most of it
<br />
<br />I know someone ported Sonic 1 to the 32X, but thats a whole different concept.

Audio, Graphics, and Memory Mapping. Simple NES games that are NROM have been hacked by various groups to run on SNES without any access to source.

Even Chibi-Tech's song in the intro, which was even arranged for that intro, used the looped noise.  That's so blatantly wrong, heheh.<br /><br />I don't think it could ever sound right because of the samplerate and especially the SNES's sample format (loop alignment is comparable to making looped DPCM instruments on NES - not as bad though).  But it could at least sound similar, I'll keep that in mind if I ever end up working on it again.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">The real fun would come though, with any cycle-timed PPU tricks (I'd just forget about it).

<br />
<br />I think that would work too, the danger is that the SNES is 2X faster than the NES, so if those 224+ writes include much workload, then it'll be too late.  I can see $2006 writes being a problem, $2005 should be doable though.  HIRQ could go every scanline (or maybe 2) to change the indexing for the emulated PPU write buffer while it's being created.
