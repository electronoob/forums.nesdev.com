<br />I think the problem is that your posts are a bit hard to comprehend (possibly using online machine translation?) and people thought that you want to make a <em>physical</em> cart instead of a ROM <em>file</em> playable with a PC emulator (unless I also got it wrong).
<br />
<br />Physical Famicom/NES carts all have some hardware in them (the only difference is how complicated the hardware involved is, which depends on the mapper used), but if you only need a ROM file playable with an emulator you don't need to build the hardware as the emulators emulate the mappers in software.
<br />
<br />I think depending on the games, it may not be that hard to build a multicart ROM <em>file</em> (as people have already pointed you to some of the required resources), but still you need some basic knowledge on how stuff work.
<br />
<br />I cannot understand though, if you only want the games to be playable with emulators, why bother making a multicart ROM? Instead, just load whichever game you want to play from the emulators (of if you feel that the interface of an emulator is not good enough, just use a frontend GUI).
<br />
<br />P.S. Actually I couldn't see the image in the first post due to IMGSHACK's recent policy (images will only show up in external sites if either 1) the site is registered in their database or 2) the viewer has an IMGSHACK account) as I don't have an IMGSHACK account, so I'm just guessing what this is all about. Thus, I can be completely wrong...

<br />As was mentioned earlier, No-Carrier has a program available <a href="http://www.no-carrier.com/index.php?/9999-in-1/" class="postlink">here</a>.
<br />
<br />
<br />If you want to change the look of the menu, expand the number of games on the cart, or use non-NROM games, then I'm afraid you're going to have to learn a lot more about NES development before you attempt a project like this.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />ouso1999, in case you don't know, NES games larger than 40KB (32KB PRG + 8KB CHR) need special hardware on the cart. These are called "mappers", and there are lots of them. When pirates make multicarts they often take games that use the same mapper and glue them together using a "master mapper". When they want to join games that use different mappers, they hack the games so that they can work with a different mapper. This is possible only if the new mapper can do everything that the original one could, otherwise there is no way for a less capable mapper to replace a more capable one.
<br />
<br />Hacking games like this is no trivial task, and you will not be able to do it unless you have good knowledge of NES programming. There is no program that will easily allow you to do this with just a few clicks.
