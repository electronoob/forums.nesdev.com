So it probably is worth pointing out somewhere on the wiki that the vast majority of mappers with finer banks do support banking their 8KiB of CHR RAM. Currently, the only place we call that out is on the few boards that don't (mappers 153 and 157, afaik)<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3512">lidnariq</a> — Wed Apr 23, 2014 11:43 am</p><hr />

Well information have value based on how well it is written and what it was trying to explain. Depending on context, it may have not have much value. In my case, I was depending too much on emulators, which is a common beginner's mistake so the information may have value to beginners. Emulator do their best to make everything work but there is no perfect emulators since we don't know the inner of everything.<br /><br />So if people found value in it then it's ok. If not then oh well! Now what I would find some value is which tools would be usable on a mac but this is for a different thread (nintendulator doesn't work with one of the wine tool I found, cannot remap the keyboard and I don't know why.. I may restart to program someday with that computer I have access, if I find time). I cannot find the mac thread anymore, I think someone did once (Neilbaldwin?) but cannot find it anymore. FCEX fail on Mavericks (topic split?). I may code again soon, maybe not. just wishful thinking since my c# tools won't work on mac anyway.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3559">Banshaku</a> — Wed Apr 23, 2014 7:17 am</p><hr />

Most people who are not familiar with how the hardware works might not immediately understand how or why 8KB of memory banked to an 8KB addressing space would be chopped up and shuffled around. Before Banshaku confirmed this, I'm pretty sure I assumed that the 8KB of CHR-RAM in MMC3 boards were always mapped linearly, that the mapper-controlled CHR lines weren't even connected or something like that.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=95">tokumaru</a> — Tue Apr 22, 2014 6:25 pm</p><hr />

I have made the same mistake myself (~8 years ago), trying to put SMB1 on an MMC3 devcart. What's funny is that you'd expect it would be far easier for emulators to just initialize everything to zero, but they seem to go out of their way to initialize for compatibility with NROM, or whatever. Maybe some of it has something to do with iNES compatibility issues. One such issue that I can remember is that many emulators initialize MMC3 mirroring based on the flag from the iNES headers, because there are many mapper 206 ROMs out there that are marked as mapper 4. Mapper 206 is mostly compatible with MMC3, but doesn't have mirroring control (among other things).<br /><br />That's why I plan to add mapper state power-up randomization into NintendulatorDX at some point.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=80">thefox</a> — Tue Apr 22, 2014 9:13 am</p><hr />

I can't think of a good foolproof way to deal with AxROM-like situations: a game could plausibly want to do something different depending on what bank is swapped in when it reads the reset vector.

Interesting idea, but it has room for refinement.
