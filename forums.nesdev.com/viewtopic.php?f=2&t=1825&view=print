		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I was wondering, has anybody ever used this for any of their demos? Does anybody know how to use this? I couldn't even get this working with a family Basic ROM that I had. I've never really dealt with it, and I'm interested, because I'm working on a project that's like a NES PC (Personal Computer, not Program Counter.). It would have many different functions, but it would just be a cartridge, not like any new hardware. I've thought about calling it Nintendows, but I was wondering if there's anything with that name already. So yeah, does anyone know anything about this keyboard?

<br />
<br />I was thinking of having like MMC1, because you can use SRAM. But, I was thinking of like Memory Card type things, that would just be an SRAM chip that you could stick into a slot where the SRAM would usually be. I think this is possible. It's like the concept of floppy disks, except it's more like chips. It's just a battery packed SRAM chip, maybe in cool looking Memory card type looking case. Thanks for the link!
<br />
<br />EDIT:
<br />
<br />Okay, so I'm looking at this doc, and I'm just missing something here. 
<br />Like this:
<br />
<br />
<br />3.How to control the keyboard
<br />(1)Initialization
<br />the next read after initializing keyboard will be the first scan.
<br />$4016 &lt;- #$05
<br />
<br />(2) the 1st scan
<br />$4016 &lt;- #$04
<br />$4016 -&gt; D1a
<br />$4016 &lt;- #$06
<br />$4016 -&gt; D1b
<br />
<br />(3) 2nd - 10th scan
<br />same as (2)
<br />$4016 &lt;- #$04 at this point it will automatically moves on to the 
<br />next scan
<br />$4016 -&gt; D2a
<br />$4016 &lt;- #$06
<br />$4016 -&gt; D2b
<br />
<br />
<br />I have no idea what any of this means. Like, what the heck? I'm looking at everything in the doc, and looking at this, and saying, "What are they talking about?". I think I'm missing something here. Can somebody help me out?

<br />
<br />The keyboard is mostly like a normal controller, but with the following differences:
<br /><ul><li> When you write to $4016, you always have D2 set - if you leave it clear, you end up sending commands to the tape recorder instead.</li><li> You read 4 bits at a time out of $4017 D4-D1, rather than $4016/$4017 D0.</li><li> In between each read from $4017, you need to write again to $4016 and toggle D1 to advance it to the next set of keys.</li><li> You read $4017 a total of 20 times (with a $4016 write in between each one), rather than only 8.</li></ul>

<br />wasn't there some talk about creating a NES cartridge with CF-adapter for reading/writing here some month ago? can't find it thought as the search allways says that there where no finds regardless of what I search for  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_confused.gif" alt=":?" title="Confused" />
<br />
<br />edit:
<br />found it <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://nesdev.com/bbs/viewtopic.php?t=530&amp;start=0">http://nesdev.com/bbs/viewtopi ... 30&amp;start=0</a><!-- m -->

<br />not exactly the same.. as I was thinking of but it's something ^^

I was talking about NES level editors a while back, and I think tepples mentioned the idea of using the SNES mouse on the NES, and this would be great for Nintendows, because you could use the keyboard and mouse. Maybe if you could hook up the SNES mouse the the FC, or the keyboard to the US NES, you could use both.

<br />That'd be great, as a Family Basic Keyboard is hard to come by.  But there is a catch.  The Family Basic Keyboard had an audio port for a tap drive that could be used to save digital data via modulation.  Do any emulators even support this feature?  What games actually used it?

<br />
<br />I seem to recall that Excitebike uses it for its "custom track" stuff. The Family Basic cartridges almost definitely used it.
