<br />
<br />On nes theres no specific text "routines" or anything you'd have to draw your text as backround (you could do sprites but then you cant have more then 8 letters) and use the scroll register to scroll them. I suggest either just learning how to do a single sprite first or learn how to scroll the backround.

<br />Background tile data (text) is written to $2007, which auto-increments the address.  To draw it backwards (right to left), you will have to decrement the address manually, write that to $2006, for every byte you put out to $2007.

<br />Assuming PPU increment 1 is on. Also, if the buffer contains something like "dlrow ,olleH" you can draw it as is on the screen.

<br />So did old lattin letters, which were modified so that it is possible to write them with computers. Personally when I hand write I write letters mostly separed as if they were in a computer, but I know many people doesn't.

<br />
<br />Depending on how game engines does this it may be very easy or really hard to do.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />If this is a game where the text characters appear one by one per frame, use a PPU breakpoint.
<br />Games could do many things:
<br />* Build a write buffer, then replay it during Vblank.   If it's one of those game, then stick breakpoints inside the write buffer to see where the game writes there
<br />* Actually do text writes directly without building a buffer.
<br />
<br />Either way, you need to find out how it calculates the address of each character it adds, how it increments the vram address, how it resets the cursor to the left, and how it compares with the right to go to the next line.  Changes these things, and the text will go right to left.
<br />But expect a game to have lots of different text display routines, so you'll need to do this a bunch of times.
<br />
<br />Data breakpoints are your friend.  When you see the game read a character from the ROM, you can make the emulator stop there, then step through the code and see what it's doing.  I suggest you find some text in the ROM file, find out where the real NES address is, then put breakpoints for multiple characters.
