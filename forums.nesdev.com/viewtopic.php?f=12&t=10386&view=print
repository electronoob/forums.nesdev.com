		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />This probably doesn't help you specifically, since you already have a Willem, but I built an adapter to program Flash/E(E)PROMs using a Teensy++, which ends up being a lot cheaper than a Willem, a lot less hassle, and it's fully USB-powered and controlled, unlike most Willems (other than the GQ-3/4X models).  EEPROM programming is a simple enough process as to be trivial to implement in a microcontroller (assuming you don't require HV programming).  Mainly, you just need a ton of I/O pins for parallel ROMs.

What software do you use then when using your custom done teensy board?<br /><br />I just wasn't sure if this was something that someone had dealt with prior using the tsop to willem adapter.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />My adapter connects the Teensy++ directly to the ROM, so USB-&gt;Teensy-&gt; adapter-&gt;ROM.  Most of the software is implemented on the Teensy, and the PC side is just a serial terminal with the ability to transmit files (I use RealTerm). It wouldn't take much to write a better PC client, but I haven't bothered since RealTerm serves my purposes.<br /><br />Total cost is the cost of Teensy ($20) plus about $5 for the adapter, depending on the kind of socket you choose to use.<br /><br />I only mention it to say that a Willem/GQ-_X is more expensive and more trouble than necessary for someone just looking to burn a few ROM chips.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />IIRC, the BuyICNow boards for the AM29F032B chips pull /WE high through a pull-up resistor/solder jumper.  That would obviously be a problem...  I'm really not sure how the guy who made that adapter ever managed to get it working in the first place.<br /><br />As for my Teensy++ adapter, it's pretty simply a double-sided socket carrier that just connected the pins in such a way that it made the code nicer (connecting contiguous address/data pins to the same I/O port).  Bit-bang programming an EEPROM is pretty easy in code.  Honestly, the hardest part was creating a PC interface that was flexible and easy to use.  My code is still a bit rough, and there is more hard-coding than I'd like, but it works solidly.  <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/viewtopic.php?p=112150#p112150" class="postlink">Here it is</a> if you're interested.<br /><br />Honestly, once I get my PIC18F45K50 samples in, I could re-spin this design to bring the price of the entire project down to the ~$15 mark.  The Teensy++ just made for a convenient starting point.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I have one board left.  For those TSOP boards, it requires 1 jumper wire, because the /WE pin on the chip doesn't connect to any of the DIP pins.  In fact, that's probably the reason your GQ-4X isn't working.  Here is the relevant pad on the PCB, though honestly, I don't know where you'd want to connect it on the Willem.<br /><br /><img src="http://i44.tinypic.com/2z591jl.jpg" alt="Image" />

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I'm not following this thread, however I noticed the BuyICNow board up above me. I want to make public there is a board that they now have (IV), although they still call it III by accident. It has all the jumpers besides SJ1 permanently connected (no jumpers). I bought one myself and received it, works flawlessly. In my case, my SNES flasher flashes from within the SNES cart, so I made sure to take the last Mask ROM pin (2nd VCC), which is connected to /WE, and NOT connect it to the SNES cart (ie remove the pin and solder a wire to the top only) and made sure to connect it where you need /WE (I connected to /WR). <br /><br />For Info purpose the (III) board's connections (as pic'd in above post):<br />R1 ties /RESET High to VCC (never reset)<br />R2 ties the middle of SJ1 to GND,<br />SJ1 ties the Address lines A20, A21 together, along with R2 ties both these lines to GND. This is for using the large flash chip in a smaller capacity situation (perhaps for when substituting this adaptor for the 32-pin mask rom scheme, which has no A20,A21).<br />R3 Connects /WE to the last Mask ROM pin, (36) VCC.<br /><br />Buyicnow carries 2 substitutes, perfect replacements, for the AM29f032 chips. One is the ST M29F032D : <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.buyicnow.com/fincat.php?cat=1070">http://www.buyicnow.com/fincat.php?cat=1070</a><!-- m --><br />The other is the  Fujitsu 29F033C. I myself purchased the ST model and can say it works perfectly. I've flashed this a handful of ROMs already and am currently playing Dr. Super Mario World : House Calls hack on it (one of the few SMW hacks that works flawlessly on real hardware, out of the handfull I have tried. Chaos Complexx works too <img src="./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" />. Love it!!!
