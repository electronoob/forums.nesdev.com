I think a configuration manager would be kind of overkill for a project of this size. If any merging is needed, either let each developer merge before committing any changes, or let the lead developer handle it.<br /><br />And of course like blargg said, agree on a common toolset before getting started. For this kind of project which is relatively small and short-term with no maintenance required after the product is finished I don't know if a common code style is that important. What the developers would have to agree upon is a general design - like which memory areas should be used for what, what the code flow should look like and the principal functions needed.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=1181">mic_</a> — Thu Jun 05, 2008 12:37 am</p><hr />

A project like this might need someone who's job is specifically to snap all the code together. Coding styles don't really need to be the same, as long as they can all work together in the end. However, there needs to be a lot of communication between people so there aren't retarded bugs just because one coder doesn't know something another coder did.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=138">Celius</a> — Wed Jun 04, 2008 3:04 pm</p><hr />

When people are serious about working together on a project, they usually choose a common toolset and coding style for all members to use.

Yeah, that's another thing. We all code so differently, with different goals in mind. For example, some people make code that will be space-efficient, but have its limits. I'm the type of person who codes trying so hard not to have any limits on anything. I try to make everything as universal and open-ended as possible. However, I don't really have much to show off, because the only game I ever showed anyone was this piece of garbage simply called "The Game" which probably wouldn't even run on the NES because it's coded so sloppily. I believe on my site you can find it, the link's in my signature. But don't worry, my coding style has changed drastically since then.<br /><br />We also are all used to different assemblers. So a project where we are all working together would be a little complicated, as I understand lots of people around here use assembler-specific macros and stuff.<br /><br />EDIT: Are signatures not showing anymore? I can't see anyone's...

<div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"><br />Any more than anyone else who doesn't have a job is jealous of people who have a job?<br /></div><br />Yeah, but having a job is supposed to gives you a hard time everyday, and in the end you are paid for you bothering all the day with more or less annoying stuff. Of course not all jobs are that annoying, but overall if you could live with a job or without any job and without the financial and social consequences that this have, most people would chose to not have a job. Hower, if that would happen everybody would do nothing, and in the end everyone would die hungried as nobody would cultivate/sell food for everyone.<br /><br />What I mean is that you usually don't be paid to have fun (okay there is soccer players who are paid bilions to kick a ball). NES coding can be both fun and annoying at the same time, but overall it's a lot more fun than annoying, and there is probably more people that would like code a NES game than people that would buy it.<br /><br />Now back on the subject, you still didn't mention what skills you are exactly looking for. After you've done a whole load of routines it's not hard to copy/paste them and modify them to be used in a different game. However, probably for example tokumaru's routines and tepple's routines have few in common with mines, while not being better or worse, and megre them would be almost impossible due to the low-level nature of assembly language.<br /><br />Personally I have probably skills to code a game of decent simplicity, altrouht I haven't released any game yet so I'd feel bad showing off I'm able to code a game. But I have a complete game engine, which has it's limits, but is still complete. I have no skills if you need something like artificial intelligence or something like that.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=38">Bregalad</a> — Wed Jun 04, 2008 10:06 am</p><hr />

Your art is cool, but for an NES game design I wanted to advise you that game designs are a dime a dozen and it regularly happens that people come around looking for someone to make it work.  So you may have to show what's special about this one, to get the attention being sought.<br /><br />I can do programming, sound, hardware design and manufacturing, general advice.  But I'd have to know why to get interested and involved.  I don't think anyone here does it for the money.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=10">Memblers</a> — Tue Jun 03, 2008 10:07 pm</p><hr />

Oh don't worry I was saying that lighly, not "seriously". You don't have to take this all badly. It's just that when I said scrolling was an easy part of writing a game engine you replied you disagreed and that was complicated if you did it during gameplay, as I don't do it during gameplay. And now you said it was easy. I guess once you did it it's always easy, as Celius said.<br /><br />Anyway yeah we have to learn more from the author, as I still doubt he was that "serious".
