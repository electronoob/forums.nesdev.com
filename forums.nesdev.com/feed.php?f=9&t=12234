So, IIRC, the CopyNES lies and claims it's reading from $4800-$4FFF whenever it's actually reading from the BIOS... it should be possible to modify the 74'139 from the NES's mainboard and instead unmap the NES's internal 2k of RAM or the PPU instead...<br /><br />Normally, pin 15 on the mainboard's 74'139 (2/G) is always grounded, and the 2nd selector there produces /INTSEL <span style="font-size: 50%; line-height: normal">(which then chains into the 1st selector to produce /RAMSEL, /PPUSEL, and two unused signals) </span>and /ROMSEL ... if you instead replaced pin 15 with the 74'157's SEL input in kevtris's <a href="http://kevtris.org/Projects/copynes/images/CopyNES_Schem1.gif" class="postlink">schematic</a> ... shouldn't that work? I guess you might need to change the fixed address presented on the 74'157's Bx inputs too.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3512">lidnariq</a> — Mon Jan 12, 2015 1:35 am</p><hr />

If I understand this correctly... it sounds like the problem is just that the Everdrive N8 maps things into $4800-4FFFF, so there's a bus conflict when the CopyNES is trying to read its own BIOS during reset?<br /><br />If that's the case I guess there isn't really anything I can do about it.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=5165">rainwarrior</a> — Mon Jan 12, 2015 1:08 am</p><hr />

Not much fix for the unfortunately that I know of.  The N8 acts real flaky for me on the HDMI adapter too.  It especially hated overclocking and overclocking more than 2.2MHz causes it to crash so hard only a power cycle will fix it.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=230">kevtris</a> — Sat Jan 10, 2015 2:24 pm</p><hr />

I discovered very recently that the Everdrive N8 does not boot if you have a CopyNES installed. I didn't have much luck at Krikzz's forum; I get the impression that he doesn't have a CopyNES that he could test against, and isn't really interested in supporting this fairly rare device.<br /><br />I was wondering if anyone here has any insight as to why the N8 can't boot if there's a CopyNES in the mix. Specifically, I'm wondering if I could revise the CopyNES BIOS to avoid the problem (similar to how caitsith2 managed to mostly eliminate the <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/viewtopic.php?f=2&amp;t=11124" class="postlink">CopyNES RAM reset</a> problem with a <a href="https://code.google.com/p/usbcopynesblue/source/detail?spec=svn99&amp;r=98" class="postlink">BIOS revision</a>), or if the conflict is inherent and unavoidable. I'm just asking if anybody has any ideas about this already. If not, I'll eventually look into it myself and report back.<br /><br />I'd rather not have to choose between using my CopyNES or the Everdrive N8; that CPU is only going to slide in and out of a socket so many times before a pin breaks.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=5165">rainwarrior</a> — Sat Jan 10, 2015 1:58 pm</p><hr />
