I know it appears on PowerPak, but I'm not sure if that's correct.

The music's pretty nice too.<br /><br />I wonder what the best game LJN made is...

They have trade dollar values for every situation, such as two properties with third unowned, getting or giving a monopoly, etc.  They can also be exploited in a one-on-one game, sell all your properties to the AI so they have no money, then auction all property really cheap.<br /><br />Sculptured Software's music engine also ended up in Action 52.

Plus, if someone in the US wants to do further analysis of it, I can always mail 'em the cart for cheap.  :-)

It's acclaim's copy cat: <a href="http://bootgod.dyndns.org:7777/profile.php?id=2687" class="postlink">bootgod</a>...  <s>The Scandiavian version is accliam&#39;s copy cat, but the German</s> The PAL versions are TLROM original Nintendo mapper though.  Both of those pal versions are the same rom too (checksum) <br /><br />EDIT:  The way bootgod's flags flip around threw me for a loop when I was clicking. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" /><br /><br />The acclaim copy cat may very well have a slight difference in the scanline counter...<br /><br />My original mmc3 dev board does appear broken <img src="./images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" alt=":(" title="Sad" />...  I was going to test it out in the official mmc3 and see how it does.  I probed around looking for broke traces and couldn't find anything either.  I probably fried the thing.<br /><br />I did test it on my hardware implementation of the mmc3 and the words on the bottom of the title screen were jumpy similar to what it sounds like the everdrive is doing.  But even if the acclaim mmc3 doesn't do this I don't feel so bad, since it may be acclaim's variant that's behaving differently.  I might make another original mmc3 devcart though to see how the official mmc3 behaves.<br /><br />EDIT:  I do own WWF steel cage which is the same chip, but different board.  If there isn't any glitching with koitsu's cart I can break out my logic analyzer and/or oscope to try and see if I can measure any difference between the MC-ACC and MMC3's IRQ's.
