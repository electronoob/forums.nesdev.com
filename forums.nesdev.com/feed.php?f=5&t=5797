Heh, "accurate speed" is a very interesting term! But I guess you are right, the closer to 60 fps, the more accurate the speed is.<br /><br />When developing I try to get the I/O stuff out of the way first, and this is when emulator accuracy is most important. However, it has happened to me before that something that *shouldn't* be directly related to I/O broke some of the I/O logic. So I use Nintendulator and Nestopia during all my programming sessions, and every few days I test it on the PowerPak as well (even multiples times in a day if I'm doing something too hardcore that looks funky on emulators).<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=95">tokumaru</a> — Sun Dec 06, 2009 8:24 pm</p><hr />

When testing for defects in the parts of a program that do I/O (usually the video or sound code), I care about accuracy because my program is unknown.<br /><br />But once I know a program's I/O is solid, I start testing for game logic defects or balance. At that point, I start to care more about ways I can sacrifice accuracy in obscure cases to gain speed accuracy while retaining compatibility. When play-testing things on the city bus, I'll even turn on PocketNES's PPU hack and auto speed hack (e.g. BEQ skipping or BVC skipping) because it makes the speed more accurate.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=9">tepples</a> — Sun Dec 06, 2009 7:20 pm</p><hr />

Litmus tests are too arbitrary. As I've said, I don't think any (S)NES emulator is accurate. I don't think there's a concept of "accurate" as a boolean attribute. It's all relative. Emulator A can be more accurate than Emulator B, but that doesn't make either accurate or either inaccurate.<br /><br />And again, 98% of people don't care about accuracy at all. They care that it plays their favorite games, that it's easy to use, and perhaps most importantly, that it was the first tool they used.<br /><br />Example: I wrote xkas v06 as an SNES cross assembler, it was the first tool of its kind publicly distributed. But it was a terrible tool that I wrote in a single day, and it shows. I went back and spent two weeks writing xkas v12 -- it is better in every possible way, but everyone uses v06 instead. Because it was the first one out there.<br /><br />Another example is IPS vs UPS. IPS is a pathetically inferior format in every single possible way, but it's what caught on first. Not even any bias, IPS excels at <em>nothing</em>. Bigger patch sizes, limited to 16MB, can't unpatch, can't verify patches, can't detect copier headers, includes potentially copyrighted data directly, has three different post-spec extensions that are supported differently by each tool, and on and on. Yet everyone loves it.<br /><br />Nestopia got popular because NESticle may as well have been DOS only, was discontinued, and because it was much more accurate, really awesome in terms of features, and was at the right place at the right time; when people were looking to go from DOS to Windows for their emulator needs.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=375">byuu</a> — Sun Dec 06, 2009 5:49 pm</p><hr />

- Well, I'd like to setup a few things regarding the accuracy of a NES emulator, please, changes and suggestions are welcome.<br /><br />0. The emulator must emulate the CPU, even if the PPU displays nothing or a distorted image, meaning color attribute problems or even a wrong tile arrangement.<br /><br />1. The PPU output must be clean, using right attribute colors, palette and "decent" scrolling. The "decent" means proper emulation of sprite 0 hits, but not rastering effects/splits with IRQs.<br /><br />2. The APU unit must be emulated correctly, the proper I/O registers behavior. Sound output isn't required for this level.<br /><br />3. All the 3 units work OK and pass through a test suite (PPU, CPU and APU). The sound output is still optional, much like the PPU video output filtering.<br /><br />4a. PPU timing is accurate, meaning the VBlank, NMI and sprite 0 hit timings.<br />4b. APU timing is accurate, meaning the 4 or 5 steps + 4017h register.<br /><br />5. Mapper IRQs work with no major problems. Glitching is allowed if occurs in the NES hardware.<br /><br />- Well, as comparision, NESticle is at level 2. ^_^;;<br />- You can say that emulator X is inaccurate only if it's on level 0 or 1, but partially accurate from level 2. I'd say "accurate" at level 3, and "perfectly accurate" at level 4, since 5 looks "optional".<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=39">Zepper</a> — Sun Dec 06, 2009 3:36 pm</p><hr />

Bah, that was really poorly worded, sorry. I was trying to say that they're not appropriate for improving accuracy as a whole, as in for the entire scene and everyone else's emulators. Meaning you can implement them, but you haven't made something that's better than existing emulators.<br /><br />Of course if the test ROMs verified a behavior and you passed it, that would make your emulator more accurate. Assuming of course you didn't implement it wrong while still getting a pass result. That's one of the big limitations of test ROMs. The person making them understands the entire situation, but may not necessarily catch every "wrong" case. Thus, the person making the test ROM is more likely to pass it the correct way than anyone else.<br /><br />For instance, I may write a decimal-mode overflow flag test, but I can't really test all 4 billion combinations of 16-bit registers, so I test the corner cases. I spent weeks working on it so I know all about how decimal-mode and overflow works, but you're simply trying to get a pass or fail and trying random things until success. So you mess up 0+1 due to some subtle bug.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=375">byuu</a> — Sun Dec 06, 2009 6:18 am</p><hr />

On my testing branch, I was able to fix the glitch very quickly by changing what I assumed to be the problem. But of course, to commit that I wanted to verify on hardware. Sure enough, I was wrong. That wasn't what real hardware was doing. I had to try about 20 more things, ruling out every possibility, before I found out what was really wrong and got it fixed properly. It's very often the case that hardware is doing the last thing you'd expect. The most illogical one of all.<br /><br />For an analogy, say your emulator is a square and you want to fit it into a circle peg, only you can't see the circle at all without a dev-kit. You can chisel away and keep trying, but by the time it finally passes through, you won't have anything at all like a circle. You could just have a small square, for instance.<br /><br />You can't be certain that what you've done to pass a test or get a game working was the correct answer, and neither can anyone else looking at your work. Development of an emulator that doesn't target those hardware restrictions and limitations creates a tiny square that is much <em>more</em> forgiving than the real thing. You'll see this often in emulators: it's why homebrew fails while commercial software works so well. They're working from the top down rather than from the bottom up.<br /><br />Of course, not everyone has the ability to obtain a dev-kit and that shouldn't be held against you. I'd say at the very least, please aim to be as restrictive as possible. For instance, if you're not sure if you can write to a certain register at a certain time; don't allow it at all. It's better to find out you broke a game that relied on that behavior than for a homebrew dev to find out that your allowing it broke their code on the real system.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"><br />The UI is the least important thing though, IMO.<br /></div><br /><br />For a developer or program tester, this is absolutely true. But the average user will run screaming if they don't like your UI. There does actually seem to be a good subset of users who really love completely custom UIs for their uniqueness over their function. You can see that with Genecyst, ZSNES and RetroCopy for instance.<br /><br />It may not look pretty, but nothing beats platform integration for usability. Knowing that you can tab through controls, copy and paste text out of the debugger, that drag and drop works, that all the keyboard shortcuts follow the convention of your OS, that you can use the title bar to move and window borders to resize the window, etc. It's a much smaller learning curve.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"><br />If I would be harsh, I could say for example that all emulators are not accurate since they don't support the same behavior of real mappers when the game fail to initialize it properly.<br /></div><br /><br />I really don't think any emulator is even close to my ideal of accuracy, including my own. I was quite surprised to hear how black box the NES PPU still is, even though you guys have pixel-level renderers now.<br /><br />Initialization is the worst: often times it's random, but randomness is an emulator breaks testing, breaks movie playback, breaks netplay, etc etc.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=375">byuu</a> — Sat Dec 05, 2009 10:25 pm</p><hr />

You can use all kinds of hacks to pass all of blargg's tests, but that won't make an emulator any more accurate.

Nope, my emu has no hacks... but it's not SO terrible and they are present in a few other emulators.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"><br />Sure! The tests are useful, and if one can use them to find and correct bugs in their emulator, causing it to pass the tests without hacks, that's great!
