This might be zeroes, or it might be space characters ($20) in a game that uses ASCII for tiles $20-$3F, or it might be $24 in a game that uses the same character encoding as Donkey Kong, Super Mario Bros., and a lot of other early NES games.
<br />
<br />Initialized by the emulator? That depends on what make and model of RAM chip you're emulating. But make sure you write <em>something</em> there so that an NES game can't covertly read private data from other applications running on the same PC as the game.

<br />
<br />Usually people just zeroed out memory even though that is not accurate. I think FCEUX has a pattern of FFs and 00s. Other emulators initialize everything to like 55 or 53. As tepples said, the real hardware depending on the RAM chip.

<br />
<br />Metroid won't boot if CHR-RAM is initialized to certain values.  Don't know exactly what values trigger boot failure, but for a while, FCEUX wouldn't boot Metroid if you launched it from the command line.  FCEUX did not initlaize CHR-RAM at all, leaving it as whatever was in the PC's memory at the time.  After FCEUX started initializing CHR-RAM, Metroid worked again.

They would have to assume that RAM chips would have a specific power on state and that never could you reset the system with the wrong values in place. Really I just think it's bad code. Though that is a good point Gilbert, perhaps because it was a FDS game conversion maybe it assumes the FDS BIOS had run before it.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />No you don't understand. RAM is in an undetermined state on powerup or reset. You cannot assume RAM is all zeroes or all FF or any other pattern. You can check RAM to see if there is integrity markers for some sort of on Reset behavior. X-Men on Sega Genesis does this. But generally you should never use memory that has not been initialized. It could contain anything on power up/reset. Assuming a state is how you end up with software that only works on emulators that initialize this specific state. The same can be said of registers like PPU registers. Their state cannot be assumed on reset.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />It's very simple. On powerup RAM could contain any value at any location. In reality it depends on the chip. I believe they generally have a certain pattern to them. This will only be the case when you power on, not when you reset as RAM contents will contain whatever was there when you reset still.
<br />
<br />So to detect a "reset" you just need to reserve some RAM for a signature that you will set at some point in your program. The signature should be defined and not something that would possibly be the value on ram powerup. So you'd want to avoid 00 or FF, and probably F0 or 0F. The more bytes you use the more reliable it is, the easiest thing to do is just a 3 byte string. I mean you could just write the word CAT or DOG to ram and check for it on reset to detect a powerup versus just a reset. There is basically no chance ram will contain those values on powerup, only on reset after your program writes it.
<br />
<br />Bad programming is using variables/memory without knowing they have been initialized. This is true in all programming. Unless you have reason to believe the contents are initialized or have a reason to read them. There are reasons you might but when programming a game, you generally should be sure to initialize everything. It's just basic programming.
