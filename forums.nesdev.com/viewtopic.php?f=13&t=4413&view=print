<br />And I guess asking people to compute something like 23 + 17 and inputl the answer (but with randomly selected numbers) when registering should get most spammers away.
<br />I've also commonly seen strings of letters and numbers randomly arranged in an image created on the fly and the user has to decode them, something automated spammers can't do unless they have very complex AI in them. The server has to support this things I guess, but I know nothing about servers and all.

<br />NESdev already tries to do this, but the standard phpBB 2 CAPTCHA is <a href="http://caca.zoy.org/wiki/PWNtcha" class="postlink">weak</a>. There appears to be a <a href="http://recaptcha.net/plugins/phpbb/" class="postlink">reCAPTCHA mod for phpBB 2</a>, but you need FTP privileges (a step up from admin) to install it.

<br />The problem with CAPTCHAs is that the answer is sent along with the question. Maybe you could generate a code, and the user uses it to find the respective word in a table found somewhere else, and provide textual instructions on how to find that table. The moderator would then compare the code and the word to see if they match. Only a human could pass through that that, because a computer would not be able to follow written instructions of where to find the answer. I don't know if it would work, but is the best I can think of right now.

<br />Perhaps a field could be added to the registration page/profile that simply asks: "In 10 words or less, why are you joining this board? (REQUIRED)" OR perhaps just "Are you a spammer? Type YES or NO."
<br />
<br />Spambots obviously aren't equipped to handle unique fields like those, and you can visually weed out spam accounts based on their replies (or lack thereof). If a human should happen to ignore the warnings and big red (REQUIRED)s, well, maybe they shouldn't be posting here in the first place.
<br />
<br />If you don't have the privileges to do this, tepples, why not find the person who does and ask them nicely? No other phpBBs I frequent have spambot problems like this one because they've actually <em>done something about it at the code level.</em> You can't fix this problem by twiddling with the pre-installed features.
