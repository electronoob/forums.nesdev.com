These two programs come to mind, and both are downloadable.  It looks like neither can be downloaded from these links, but if it's not available elsewhere and it's allowed, I could upload them here.  tUME is already on the nesdev front page, but it's only a link to an dead site (I'm not sure why I didn't upload the file at the time).<br /><a href="http://games.greggman.com/game/tume___the_universal_map_editor/" class="postlink">tUME</a><br /><a href="http://www.neswarpzone.com/colordreamsshrine1/nindraw.html" class="postlink">NinDraw</a><br /><br />It's not software, but I have a hardware device made in 1992 by Parallax called TurboROM.  It's an EPROM emulator.  I doubt it was used professionally for NES programming, but it's about old enough to have been possible.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=10">Memblers</a> — Fri Mar 06, 2015 7:29 pm</p><hr />

There were lots of art packages available for computers in the 80s, a lot of them would do fine for sprite artwork.

Hi! I'm very new to NES and 6502 programming, and many of the tutorials I've read reference relatively modern tools like YY-CHR and ASM6. These tools are good, but I would like to know which assemblers and sprite editors, if any, were used to create real NES games like <em>Super Mario Bros.</em> and such in the 1980's. If they are available for download today, can you send me a link to download? Thanks in advance to anyone who replies.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=6919">nesnoob</a> — Fri Mar 06, 2015 5:06 pm</p><hr />
