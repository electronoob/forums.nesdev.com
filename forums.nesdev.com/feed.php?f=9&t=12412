I have an interesting update.  I was working with another defective AV Famicom.  While troubleshooting I suspected a bad CPU.  I decided to try a Nintendo CPU again. This time it worked!  I tried using both top loader and front loader NES CPU's.  Both worked.<br /><br />I cannot explain it, and now I wonder if whether my previous testing was flawed or perhaps there was something special about that first broken AV Famicom.  I unfortunately no longer have it in my possession, having since shipped it off to another user :-/<br /><br />So I suppose RP2A03 rev G and H are interchangeable after all.  I wish I had that original unit so I could run more tests.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=1729">vvv</a> — Wed Feb 25, 2015 12:24 am</p><hr />

For a specific example, I've heard that that H revision doesn't work with TKO Boxing on the Nintendo VS, but reportedly was fine with other games.  As to why, I have no idea.  The VS system AFAIK typically has a non-revision CPU. While I was hanging out in arcade forums, several people had reported it, so I don't think it was a coincidence.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=10">Memblers</a> — Tue Feb 24, 2015 6:22 pm</p><hr />

I've swapped around CPUs plenty of times, don't see why it wouldn't work.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=5671">ApolloBoy</a> — Mon Feb 23, 2015 11:28 am</p><hr />

I remember having read a few reports now and then of the 2A03H having weird compatibility issues, but I can't say we've ever seen anything particularly conclusive.<br /><br />And I have absolutely no idea how this sort of thing would arise.<br /><br />We do know we've also seen letterless, A, and C. Somewhere in the progression they switched from having an on-package oscillator (definitely in letterless) to instead having a TEST (definitely by G) pin.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3512">lidnariq</a> — Sun Feb 22, 2015 12:37 am</p><hr />

Is it possible to replace an AV Famicom RP2A03H CPU with an NTSC NES (front loader or top loader) RP2A03G CPU ?  I thought it would be possible since my understanding was that the &quot;H&quot; is just a newer revision.<br /><br />I searched the wiki and our forum and was unable to find an answer to my question.  The closest I could find was the topic:  <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/viewtopic.php?f=9&amp;t=5849&amp;hilit=rp2a03h" class="postlink">2A03 Revision H</a> and this document:  <a href="http://nesdev.com/2A03%20technical%20reference.txt" class="postlink">2A03 technical reference.txt</a><br />After some googling around I came across a few data points about some revisions.  Not sure if this is accurate or not.<br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"><br />The differences between RP2A03 reversions is well documented and known.<br />RP2A03G is the only cpu that came in NTSC front loaders<br /><br />Famicom has 4 revs, E - H.<br /><br />E - don't recall<br />F - missing looped noise playback mode<br />G - fixed long / short period noise select bit bug<br />H - dont recall<br /><br />All RP2A03 cpu will execute code the same<br /></div><br />Anyway, I had a defective AV Famicom CPU (garbled video), so I tried pulling a CPU from an NES top loader as a replacement, but it didn't exactly work.  I could hear audio, but would get no video output.   I thought perhaps they were incompatible, so I ordered a replacement  RP2A03H CPU, and got the AV Famicom back to working order.  For grins, I installed the RP2A03H into the top loader to see what would happen.  It worked just fine with full audio and video.   Does this seem odd to anyone? You can put a AV Famicom CPU into an NES, but not the other way around?<br /><br />As an aside - I have a bunch of extra RP2A03H CPU's if anyone is interested.  There was a minimum quantity order, so I had to buy a bunch of them.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=1729">vvv</a> — Sat Feb 21, 2015 11:51 pm</p><hr />
