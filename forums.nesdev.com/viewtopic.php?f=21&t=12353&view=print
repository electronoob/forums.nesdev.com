This is also why there isn't a background - I hadn't settled yet on how it should be done (in fact, if I can come up with a resonable way to get a background with parallax, I will take it). Later I got stuck with trying to keep the tile count low too, though, so I ran out of ideas &gt;.&lt; I'll see if later I can resume this with just the original challenge. I have some idea for a tree actually... (I think it's 5 tiles for the leaves and 2 for the trunk, but I need to try it to make sure)<br /><br />Also another idea was to change palettes on the fly as you move across the level, so you get to use more colors than usual in a single map. Just make sure only four palettes are visible simultaneously on screen =P<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">8bitMicroGuy wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">I have a request. Would you like to take it? <!-- l --><a class="postlink-local" href="http://forums.nesdev.com/viewtopic.php?f=21&amp;t=12497">viewtopic.php?f=21&amp;t=12497</a><!-- l --></div><br />Didn't check it yet, but here's a trick you may want to look for: a good way to get good sprites is to have two colors representing the same shade with different levels of lighting (e.g. red and dark red), and use the third color for another shade you may need (e.g. white). Yeah, I guess sprites may not look as colorful, but it will definitely look nicer than anything with outlines.<br /><br />With backgrounds you get more leeway since you actually have four colors instead of three (albeit one is shared among all palettes, and it also depends if sprites can go under the background).

This works better for backgrounds, since then you get another color you can combine with both hues.<br /><br />Blaster Master, for example, does this to draw the ground and the grass using only one palette. It doesn't look particularly amazing in crispy RGB pixels, but in NTSC it looks great! Little samson does something similar in some stages.<br /><br />The neutral color doesn't have to be gray, and you're not forbidden to combine the stronger colors, the heart of this trick is to be able to construct 2 different color ramps/gradients using a single palette, mixing and matching colors as necessary. Some dithering helps, but checkerboard patterns of 2 different colors does not create a 3rd color that's between the 2.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Other than Pocket Adventure Sonic (which I don't like even with the proper colors), it looks good! The grass looks particularly nice, but the ground suffered a bit from having its palette include a green that can be merged with the grass.<br /><br />Personally, since the dark brown and the dark green are somewhat similar, I'd try using the brown to finish the bottom of the grass pretending the color didn't change. It would maybe look strange if you looked directly at the transition, but the overall picture would look better because the ground would have more depth with an extra color for highlights. Since a much bigger area of the screen is covered by ground tiles than ground/grass transitions, the trade would probably be worth it. Several games have this kind of harsh color transitions and it really doesn't look that bad, specially after the video is NTSC'fied.
