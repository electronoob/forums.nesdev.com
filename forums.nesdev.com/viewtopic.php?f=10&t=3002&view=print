<br />First of all i would like to say hi to everyone here..im new here..my nick is mu, im a game programmer myself but i program for the pc..im doing an online rpg, never tried to program a console game so i have a few questions. if i make a typo then remember english is not my first language...
<br />
<br />ok here we go..
<br />
<br />
<br />1-Is there a COMPLETE homemade nes game out there?, i ask this because i see lots of ppl trying to program for the nes but i can't find one complete game..
<br />
<br />2-Is there another site with homemade nes games that i could download??
<br />
<br />3-How many people are interested in playing homemade nes games??, after the hard work how much exposure or recognition you get for this kind of project??
<br />
<br />4-I see that programming in ASM and the 6502 is harder than programming with a high level language, so how much time and effort people put into making a nes game?
<br />
<br />5-is it mainly a hobbyst thing? or a challenge??
<br />
<br />
<br />umm i have run out of questions for now, hopefully somebody can answer them.

<br />
<br /><div class="quotetitle">mu wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">3-How many people are interested in playing homemade nes games??, after the hard work how much exposure or recognition you get for this kind of project??<br /></div><br /><br />Lots of people.  People who want to play it on emulators, and people like collectors (or serious NES gamers, heheh) want it on carts.  If you finish a game I can help with building carts and publishing them.  I'm really pleased with the ones I've built so far (been a little while though, but I do have the supplies, ton of PCBs + memory chips..).<br /><br />My projects get more recognition than I'd have expected.  I've met some people in person even just recently and when I brought up some of the stuff I've worked on, they've actually heard of it before.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">4-I see that programming in ASM and the 6502 is harder than programming with a high level language, so how much time and effort people put into making a nes game?<br /></div>
<br />
<br />Personally, I find ASM easier than high-level languages.  Probably due to my experience.  High-level languages usually seem to have code libraries to help out with all kinds of stuff, you start from scratch with ASM.  But as I've written games and demos I've kept routines and built my own useful libraries that I always reuse.

It's really not too exciting at all. The B flat scale is the theme song. It's the first game I ever made, and I didn't know too much about coding, so it's almost excusable.
