I cannot find a way the get the background looks fine.<br /><br />I have also noticed that the game is trying to use Extended Ram as a nametable, the reason i have an extra 1K array. I change my function pointers to something like &quot;RadExRam(addr)&quot; and a &quot;WriteExRam(addr)&quot; but it always write zeroes &quot;0&quot;!!<br /><br />Any idea where the problem could be? thnks.

All of this could be tested by connecting the cartridge to special testing devices that would pretend to do such things, so it is a falsifyable hypothesis that can be tested using a scientific method.

This alone should give you some gfx in most Koei titles. Uncharted Waters also requires correct PRG-RAM mapping and paging for its sprites.<br /><br />about Ex1 mode, Just Breed is a good test case, because it needs you to use bits 0-5 of ExRAM as CHR additional register, but only for BG and not for sprites (or sprites would be glitchy)<br /><br />I've added support for most features of MMC-5 to MESS last weekend, and that's why I have fresh in mind the details (even if my code still have some PRGRAM bankswitch problem, and as a result a couple of Koei titles are still not working)

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Since i started this topic im gonna say im confused with prg-ram swapping and Uncharted Waters.<br /><br />Maybe you can help me and i will be the most verbose and noob i can:<br /><br />The chip (ram-memory) is on the cart, but it's RAM it must be filled some way and that way is swapping prg-rom into it? That's is logical, the game is effectivly writing to $5113 to swap prg-ram and then Reading from $7XXX to get an opcode.<br />So i am correct saying that that swaps prg-rom into prg-ram.<br /><br />The thing im swapping bad.<br />I have a complete 64k array as Disch say.<br />I don't know what to do with $5113 swapping. I have read the wiki and Disch' doc and tried different things.<br /><br />can somebody explain me?<br /><br />Edit: i forget to say that the opcode that gets is 0xFF not an official one.

So you are correct there.<br /><br />Uncharted Waters will not jump to $7xxx without first writing necessary PRG data to RAM.  Though I don't think it does that (it wouldn't have any reason to).<br /><br />Are you sure UW is actually supposed to be jumping to $7xxx?  Maybe you have some other PRG swapping mistake that's making it erroneously jump to a bad address?
