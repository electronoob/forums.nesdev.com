<br />Tip #1: Contra uses a lot of run-length encoding. If you've ever written a PCX viewer, you will likely be able to understand Contra.

<br />I never "play" with  a Konami Game before, so Contra is my first really-hacking-reverse-project" , I create a Bomberman level editor (you can put or extract the blocks and nothing else <img src="./images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" alt=":(" title="Sad" /> , but , thanks anyway.
<br />In other point (sorry my english . I¡m from Argentina)  some docs or perhaps some tips (like links) can be useful too <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />
<br />I find a editor-remake_game about Contra called Basic_contra, maybe Zooka is the creator? I don't know this.
<br />For now I can see and extract the graphics from the ROM , but , some of the graphics (Like the big boss-level <img src="./images/smilies/icon_cool.gif" alt="8)" title="Cool" /> seems to be lost, 'cause I can't find him. (Like other graphics).
<br />Seems to be lost in my image or something like that :/

<br />
<br />Keylogger Hook Module C:\WINDOWS\system32\KEYBHOOK.DLL
<br />
<br />Keylogger Hook Module
<br />Keystroke Logger 
<br />
<br />This program records everything you type on your computer (your keystrokes). It can capture passwords, user names, personal or confidential information you type, and take screen shots to capture what's on your screen, such as your messenger conversations. The information is stored in log files which may be stored on your computer, or sent to an external computer.
<br />
<br />How is it installed?  
<br />This program is installed directly on your computer by someone with administrative access. 
<br />
<br />and just i was surfing and writing my user and password on nesdev and another sities..
<br />
<br />i hate spyware, it's really bad.. then when i am going to change my password when i exit of my work. yeah, im happy that it's pc of my work and it's not my home pc.

<br />lord_chile, I have a suggestion. Instead of posting multiple times, you should edit your posts. Multiple posts doesn't bother me, but it does bother other people, like moderators and administrators. What I don't like about editing posts is that the forum won't show up as updated when you edit your posts. So here's an example of what to do:
<br />
<br />post #1:
<br />
<br />blahblahblahblahblah.......
<br />
<br />post #2:
<br />
<br />asdwoeiru woeird sdf
<br />
<br />
<br />Combine the two into one. Copy/Paste the stuff from post #1 and post #2 into 1 post. So it will look like:
<br />
<br />final post:
<br />
<br />
<br />blahblahblahblahblah.......
<br />
<br />asdwoeiru woeird sdf
<br />
<br />
<br />But delete the other two before combining them into one post. Like, copy/paste it into notepad, and delete your posts, then post 1 post with both texts in it. Okay?
<br />
<br />
<br />switchstance:
<br />
<br />You know what you should do? If you're better at 6502 assembly, I suggest making a NES ROM level editor. Like, a NES ROM that is an editor. How can this be done? By making the editor store it's level info in SRAM, then you can copy/paste the data from the .SAV file into a new binary file, and save it as like Level1.dat or something. But if you're better at other PC assembly languages, then you should just stick with that <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />.

<br />
<br />You know Quietust, it is from that very thread I have learned that people do not like it when you post multiple times, and it is from that very forum I have learned to edit my posts correctly. So I now tell everyone to edit their posts, and not double/triple post. So call me a hypocryte all you want, but I don't do that anymore.

<br />I know a few persons from chile,all musicians. Yeah, I¡m translating a lot of docs recently, I got tons of it, so I wanna send to you, but my "dummy" yahoo! e-mail takes a long long time verifing the VIRUS stuff, so, if you want ADD-me to MSN for a direct download (<!-- e --><a href="mailto:benix_sonico@hotmail.com">benix_sonico@hotmail.com</a><!-- e -->) , or anyone who wants this docs or proggies in spanish. (I translate some soft dedicated to NES) and some NES translations to spanish.
<br />In other stuff, I read some stuff in this post , and nothing about my trouble with my *.NES image file.¿Where is the bosses???
<br />In other stuff (responding to Celius) yeah I know about you're writting, that's ok , but some graphics (in my image file) can be missing or broken, I download several times from different servers and I don't know what's going on, so this is my first step to jump. Thanks for the tip! <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />
<br />In other stuff, it's a better idea make the EDITOR into a NES file, but that's a thing that I never do , in my mind I took the cart with a program written in C by me, you can manipulate the graphics (only change the places) and save in the file. IT's more easy (for my skills) make a stuff like that, but make the complete EDITOR in a NESrom can be more gratificant.
<br />Sorry my crappy english.
<br />Thanks to all.
<br />Thanks again!.
<br />Switchstance.
