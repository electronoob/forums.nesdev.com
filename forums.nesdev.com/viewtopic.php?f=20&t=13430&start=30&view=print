Retail discs are pressed from a master (they're not burned at all), and contain pits that deflect the laser away from the reading sensor. Recordable discs are in fact burned, and the burned spots become opaque and stop reflecting the laser, so these spots have the same effect as the pits in a pressed disc, as far as the reader is concerned. Rewritable media is more complex, it's made of a material that can change states multiple times.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">tokumaru wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">Is this mini DVD-R technology different than what the GameCube normally uses?</div><br />Physically, the difference is that GameCube discs are pressed, and DVD-R is burned. In addition to that, there appears to be differences in the protocol, according to the page tepples linked to. I do know that the protection can be circumvented though, because there are people running games off of mini DVD-Rs.

I've never quite understood as to how programs never catastrophically fail from reading off of something as seemingly unreliable as that. (Just one bit could mean either jumping back to the start of a loop or running off into nowhere...)<br /><br />Like you said though, the fact that if it's pressed or burned is irrelevant, so it all comes down to this protocol thing. If you bought new DVD to be burned, would the area for protocol be blank or would it already be filled out, because in that case, you're out of luck...

If some bytes are illegible, the drive's controller does various polynomial voodoo in a finite field to guess the missing bytes. The same principle is used in 2D barcodes such as QR codes.

I think later ones and all Wii consoles cannot do this via software anymore but there is a hardware (modchip) method of basically doing the same thing to enable reading standard DVDs. <br /><br />Prior to this the GameCube actually had an interesting piece of software using Phantasy Star Online and the Broadband Adapter that allowed you to stream ISO images over your network to your GameCube. The only problem is the transfer rate or the method of transferring data did not work well with audio and video streams in many games.

This was supplanted by a later release of Homebrew Channel, which incorporated the ability to do this (via the HW_AHBPROT flag) internally. Newer Wiis have drive firmware that will not read from any disc that is not an official Nintendo optical disc (GC or Wii) without a drivechip mod.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />For that matter, if you're using a modchip or Datel Media Launcher, there is no reason to use the GBP disc: GBI is better in pretty much every respect. Lower latency and native 240p support. All versions support using a GBA as a controller.<br /><br />There are three builds:<br /><br />ULL: Tries to very closely match the GBA refresh rate, and has essentially zero lag. Unfortunately many displays/upscalers either won't sync with this, or show monochrome, and occasional tearing will happen on all displays when the GBA and GC drift out of sync. But, 240p/480p output and no lag is reaaaally nice.<br /><br />LL: A bit less of a close match to the GBA native refresh rate. More compatible, and solves the tearing by adding a rolling framebuffer for 1-2 frames of lag. Still has 240p support (not sure about 480p).<br /><br />Regular: Standard refresh rates so works on any display, supports various types of scaling/borders/networking/colour adjustments/on-screen menu/etc. but has 2-3 frames of lag at 60Hz and 1.5-2 frames of lag at 120Hz (which requires HDMI mod, IIRC).<br /><br />Personally, my PVM works great with ULL, and my particular GBP/GC exhibit the tearing only relatively rarely and for a relatively short amount of time, making it a tolerable tradeoff for the reduced lag.<br /><br />EDIT: But yes, the GBP is generally cheaper to buy without the disc than with, since the disc is a lot more rare than the GBP. Since I planned to use GBI from the start, that didn't concern me, and I did burn a GBP disc anyhow for the heck of it.
