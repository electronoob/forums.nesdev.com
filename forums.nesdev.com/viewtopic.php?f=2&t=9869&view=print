		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I have some questions regarding the PCM when it deals with the MMC5.<br /><br />Ive been working on a major overhaul of The Legend of Zelda. I converted the rom from MMC1 to MMC5.<br /><br />Zelda uses $4010 &amp; $4011 for the PCM sfx located at $C000-$FFFF.<br /><br />The sfx are Link's flying sword, dungeon doors, boss sfx.<br /><br />Ive had to use the beginning of $C000, for alot of asm to take place within the hard wired bank. In doing this, Link's flying sword sfx has been overwritten, about 40% of it.<br /><br />I tried reading up on the PCM within the MMC5. Id like to know the following.<br /><br />1. Can I just use $5010-$5011 as the only way to play the PCM sfx?<br />2. It says MMC5's PCM read the raw data from $8000-$BFFF, so, does that mean it reads it within the same bank as the sound engine? Do I/can I, define any bank for where I want the PCM to be read from?<br />3. The original APU PCM pointers, that load where the specific sfx starts, and how far to read, are those included in MMC5, or do those original APU registers need to stay there?<br /><br />I appreciate any assistance. Ive never messed with the actual asm to a sound engine, ive rewritten music though.<br /><br />Thanks for reading. <br /><br />-infidelity

MMC5 PCM is not a DMC channel like the NES has, instead it outputs raw 8-bit samples that are written there.<br />In MMC5 read mode, any read from 8000-BFFF will change the sound wave, this includes CPU instruction fetches.  So executing code at 8000-BFFF will change the sound wave too.  The MMC5 won't automatically generate 8000-BFFF fetches at a regular interval, so it won't automatically play the sound for you.<br /><br />So you're best off finding a different place to store your code, or hacking the game to use a switchable bank at C000-FFFF so it can switch between multiple sets of samples.

Incidentally, the MMC3 works quite nicely for this (assuming you don't mind having $8000-$9FFF hardwired instead), and it's a lot easier to get an MMC3 to put in a physical cartridge (or find a donor cartridge) than an MMC5.

I tried doing bankswaps from within 04 to 30, but it never wirked, caused crasges, etc.<br /><br />I cant put the cide in exram, cause $5C00-$5FFF is being used specificly for Link's movements fir hookshot, pegasus shoed.<br /><br />And I cant swap my sram cause the game heavily uses sram to run the game, si when I try to swap out all the sram, it xrashes.<br /><br />So im screwed. I may just remove some of the pcm sfx that I can live without, and relocate Links flying sword pcm sfx to that area.

That said, if you look at the <a href="http://wiki.nesdev.com/w/index.php/MMC5#PRG_mode_.28.245100.29" class="postlink">wiki documentation on MMC5</a>, there is no fixed bank. You can duplicate the &quot;fixed&quot; bank (we'll call it &quot;primary&quot;) to another bank (which we can call &quot;secondary&quot;). In the &quot;secondary&quot; bank replace whatever data you can with your PCM data. Then you can swap between them seamlessly, loading up whichever bank has the data you need.

The MMC5 PCM channel doesn't actually do DPCM like the APU. Also, if you are doing PCM (and not DPCM) the APU is as pretty much equally capable of doing PCM as the MMC5 so it's not really worth using the MMC5's version. (It's not well supported in emulators anyway.)

I suppose that, together with IRQ, it might be used to play back samples at a higher sample rate if it is not doing anything else, but if it is longer than 256 then you will need the code to increment the 16-bit address. Or you might use hacks to make the CPU instructions to make music, or just use that feature only for the IRQ when reading zero from that area, which would even more hack.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />From what the patent describes, it was meant to be used along with an interrupt timer (probably external from the MMC5 itself) so your interrupt routine could be 4 cycles shorter (i.e. just read the value from RAM and skip the write to $5011), but said interrupt routine would also have to read $5010 to see if it had read the last byte (which makes it rather useless, since doing &quot;BIT $5010 ; BMI done&quot; takes just as long as &quot;STA $5011 ; BEQ done&quot; and also requires an additional &quot;CLI&quot; at the top of the IRQ routine to make it re-entrant, so overall it's <strong>slower</strong> than doing it manually).<br /><br />MMC5 PCM's &quot;read mode&quot; would really only be useful in a system that has proper support for DMA, and that system is <em>not</em> the NES.
