At least that's the theory.</div><br /><br />Well, I was told to power the PPU's haha.  It's okay, I still want to replace the encoder and we'll see if any changes occur, if not I'll continue trying to find a solution.  I really don't care much for this sfc which is why I don't mind tinkering with it.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />If PPU2 is the only one that outputs analog, Then it's really the only one that would benefit from a separate power supply.  I didn't realize PPU1 didn't have any involvement with the analog signal previously, but knowing that now, it'd be expected that only giving PPU1 a separate power supply didn't improve the picture.<br /><br />The issue is that if the power supply to an anolog circuit fluctuates, that will in turn cause the output to fluctuate.  This is giving you the <span class="posthilit">vertical</span> bar associated with same time DRAM refresh is drooping the supply.

There seems to be some sort of spike in frame 48.  Keep in mind im no expert and still learning the ways of using an oscilloscope.  Also I wanted to ask, is there a pin or voltage specifically for the DRAM?  I'd like to probe the dram at the same time of ppu2's vcc lines and see if there is any correspondence.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Pasky,<br /><br />this is a half-baked idea, but inspecting the PCB given the new cleaner schematics, I propose the following:<br /><br />1) What if the Vcc side (through 10K resistors) to Q3, Q5, and Q7 is being affected by the power droop during DRAM refresh? That because of the power droop it's an evenly darker area of the screen and it doesn't shift to a different color, because it's involving R, G, and B at the same time. What if we were to step away from PPU2 pin 5 for a second, and focus on this avenue?<br /><br />2) Seeing as how 5MOUT (PPU2 pin 27, thru R98, across C68) and 3.58M (PPU2 pin 3, across C69) are so, so close to PPU2 pin 5 and the first transistor of the RGB amplifiers (Q3, Q5, Q7), that these clock signals too are being capacitively coupled (by the close traces and geometry alone) into the Vcc supply of the R, G, and B amplifiers?<br /><br /><br />#1 would explain the wide dark bar, and #2 would explain the jailbars across the entire video frame?

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Most games should work without refresh (as long as they are constantly reading data from WRAM addresses with lower address bits ranging from 000h to 1FFh; which appears to 'refresh' the memory too, ie. particulary all games that are DMAing data from WRAM to OAM should be working perfect without refresh).<br />Knowing that, you could deactivate refreshing to see where the problem comes from:<br /><br />1) Lift WRAM.pin7 (REFRESH), and wire it to GND. The bars should disappear if they were caused by the WRAM chip.<br /><br />2) Lift CPU.pin40 (REFRESH). The bars should disappear if they were caused by the unshielded wire between CPU and WRAM.<br /><br />3) Lift CPU.pin49 (/DRAMMODE), and wire it to VCC. The bars should disappear if they were caused by the CPU's reset generator (or by the CPU's inactivity during refresh).<br /><br />If step 1 is fixing the problem then you won't need to go through the other steps (obviously), and then the solution might be to do something about WRAM supply... like lift all four VCC pins on the WRAM chip, short-cut them to each other, connect some small ceramic capacitors and some big electrolyt capacitors to them, and then insert a loop between WRAM.VCC and mainboard.VCC. I am not an expert on analog stuff, but I think a loop would be <em>the</em> solution for problems caused by inconsistent power consumption, isn't it?
