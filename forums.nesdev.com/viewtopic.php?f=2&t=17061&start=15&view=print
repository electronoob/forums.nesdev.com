For baseband composite signals, you can do everything at 1.5 Mhz according to SMPTE 170M (as I have done in my test pictures) as you stated, and everything should be fine.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Right, that was my point.<br /><br />My understanding was that there was a brief time in the dawn of NTSC where true separately bandlimited YIQ decoding was the only thing done, but it was one of the first things to be removed in the name of cost reduction. By the 1980s, my understanding is that more-or-less everyone had just switched to equal-bandwith YUV decoding instead.<br /><br />And that at no point had they done YUV or YIQ demodulation with only 600kHz for the entire chrominance signal altogether.<br /><br />Mind, if we can find a sufficiently old TV showing such abominable chrominance bandwidth, I will go find a hat to eat.

I don't know enough about the details of that process, otherwise I'd simulate it as well...

The 0.6 MHz limitation comes from limiting the signal at 4.2 MHz, or 3.6+0.6 MHz. Which is why I actually don't understand how a TV, even if it tried to, could get 1.5 MHz chroma bandwidth from an RF-modulated NES signal, because the upper sideband will be partially lost. Unless the NES' RF modulator does not actually limit the signal to 4.2 MHz, that is...<br /><br />Basically, I use a product detector for demodulation: multiply the composite signal with two carriers (inverted burst and inverted burst plus 90 degrees), gaussian filter the multiplied signal to the assumed chroma bandwidths, then subtract the filtered chroma signals from the composite signal to get luma. Working at four times subcarrier (14.32 MHz), I use a gaussian width of 4.78 for 1.5 MHz (14.32/4.75/2) and a width of 12 for 0.6 MHz (14.32/0.6/2). You tell me if that's wrong. For the overall bandwidth, I am filtering the recovered luma signal either not at all for unrestricted baseband, or with a gaussian width of 1.70 for 4.2 MHz (14.32/4.2/2). I should be doing this at the very beginning, since the 4.2 MHz cap is done by the RF modulator. But if I do that, I remove not only fine chroma detail, but a lot of chroma amplitude as well, so this may hint at an error in my method.

My normal Gaussian filter method won't work, because it's too gradual, taking almost all of the subcarrier with it, hence the desaturation. I would need basically a flat response from 0 to 4.2 MHz, then a narrow transition band from 4.2 to 4.5 MHz, with basically infinite attenuation at 4.5 MHz, all for a sampling frequency of 14.32 MHz.
