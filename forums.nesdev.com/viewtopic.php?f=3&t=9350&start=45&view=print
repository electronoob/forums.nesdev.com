PRG RAM size is stored in one place for late iNES and another for NES 2.0, in part because very few emulators ended up supporting late iNES's PRG RAM size field.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />The more I look at this, the more annoying the current state of things seems to be. When I look at kevtris' original submappers draft (<a href="http://blog.kevtris.org/blogfiles/nes/submappers.txt" class="postlink">submapper.txt</a>), it is very clear that the goal is disambiguating extant games that currently do CRC or other heuristic checks to select a mapper implementation. This is a usability improvement to the iNES mapper set, not an attempt to specify every hardware quirk that ever was.<br /><br />When I look at the wiki page (<a href="http://wiki.nesdev.com/w/index.php/NES_2.0_submappers" class="postlink">NES 2.0 submappers</a>) I see no goal or criteria as to how submappers are selected. Here's a short list of problems I can see at a glance, there's probably more:<br /><ul><li> MMC1 half of kevtris' suggestions were confusingly &quot;deprecated&quot; because someone thinks the size fields should be used to select the mapper instead. (Why the hell are we already &quot;deprecating&quot; things? This is a new spec!) I've said before that I don't think size fields are an appropriate place to select a mapper, because it muddies the specification significantly.</li><li> 002/003/007/UxROM/CNROM/AxROM proposes submappers for emulation of bus conflicts. Why? Does failing to emulate them cause a problem for <em>any</em> game?</li><li> MMC3 - confusingly different than kevtris' original set. What happened to &quot;hardware mirroring&quot; and is this necessary for any games? I actually thought that MMC6 was the &quot;poster child&quot; for why we needed submappers and I thought it was bizarre to find it not on here. (It was assigned to submapper 1 in kevtris' original doc, and Nestopia UE actually implemented this already.) Why did we throw away both of kevtris' suggestions before reassigning the slots to new ones?</li><li> MMC5 - what does &quot;wishlist&quot; mean? Does this have anything at all to do with compatibility with existing software?</li><li> VRC4 - why would we want to create submappers for board permutations that don't exist?</li><li> 34 - why did we discard the &quot;union bond&quot; mapper variation? Was it not used for anything?</li></ul><br />Kevtris' document seems quite practical to me, and straightforward to implement. The version on the Wiki is currently unusable, and not even close to compatible with Kevtris' list. How do we expect to create a standard like this?<br /><br />What I want to suggest again is that we treat this just like iNES mapper allocation. Find the problem case <em>first</em>, then create the submapper to resolve it. Don't create solutions to problems that don't exist. Submapper (and mapper) allocation must follow the needs of published software. This is not a wish-list. This is not a catalog of endless hardware variations. The wiki covers that kinda stuff in detail, and if anyone ever wants to make use of yet-unused board/mapper incompatibilities, <em>publish the software that needs it first</em>, then you can allocate the submapper.<br /><br />As for whether PRG-RAM or other fields should be used to select a mapper implementation, I vote against this, but if it really is consensus I would accept it. I think the more additional steps of logic one has to compute when selecting a mapper implementation, the more difficult and confusing the specification becomes. I think Kevtris may have had the same reasoning.<br /><br />(Similarly, I also think it's really dumb to call this &quot;NES 2.0&quot; instead of &quot;iNES 2&quot; but I'm not going to fight for a meaningless name change if this is really what we want to call this thing.)

The problem is that the wiki's &quot;standard&quot; is patently unusable, and conflicts with kevtris' other &quot;standard&quot;, and there's no consensus between emulators that have tried to adopt NES 2.0. Because of this I can't possibly hack Startropics and have that hack run in existing emulators.<br /><br />It's an arbitrary decision whether to use PRG-RAM size for disambiguation where possible, or whether to use submapper number, but you must realize that kevtris <em>already made this decision</em>, and changing it later and re-assigning those submappers works against the effort to establish a standard! Startropics was the poster child for why we needed NES 2.0 and it's been totally bunged up by this needless effort to avoid spending a submapper on it (??). I think it's an extremely bad idea to start putting special case logic in every time we could save a submapper allocation. The real world implementations of NES 2 mapper 1 and 4 are already in a bad way because of it.<br /><br />The submappers aren't scarce, and the problem cases are very small! Of all the problem cases there seem to be fewer problem games than there are submapper slots, and even if we ran out (which we won't) we could just create a new NES 2.0 mapper to hold extra sub-mappers (presumably with the same low-8 value as the original).<br /><br />Honestly I think we should scratch what's on the wiki, and start over from kevtris' document, adding only what is needed to solve existing problems that kevtris missed (or possibly correcting errors he made, if any).<br /><br />I've made a proposal on the wiki: <a href="http://wiki.nesdev.com/w/index.php/Talk:NES_2.0_submappers#Major_revision_proposal" class="postlink">http://wiki.nesdev.com/w/index.php/Talk:NES_2.0_submappers#Major_revision_proposal</a>

They were underdescribed (Mindseeker + mapper 80), overfine (VRC4?), apply to non-existant things (see next ¶), and their release coincided with a time when he was taking a break from the forum.<br /><br />The bonus fictitious mapper 78 variant? Doesn't exist. MMC3 TEROM/TFROM hardwired mirroring? Never used. The mapper 1 weirdness? His original draft was lousy with typoes. Mapper 32? Incomplete. The mapper 34 weirdness? On him.<br /><br />It was necessary to throw the whole thing out and start with just a list of where things were needed. It <strong>contains more mistakes than useful starting points</strong>.<br /><br />There are myriad documented games that rely on the presence/absence of bus conflicts on discrete logic mappers. You can search the wiki for them. <br /><br />So, let's talk specifically about StarTropics. <br />1- There is no definition of MMC6 that makes sense with a PRG-RAM quantity other than 1 KiB.<br />1b- There is no definition of SUROM vs SNROM that makes sense without the latter having 512 KiB PRG-ROM; there is no definition of SNROM, SOROM, and SXROM that makes sense without those three having 8, 16, and 32 KiB of PRG-RAM.<br />2- The decision was made to allocate a field to specify the amount of PRG-RAM AS WELL AS a generic submapper field<br />3- Why specify the same exact information twice in the header (&quot;This is StarTropics ... oh, and just in case you weren't paying attention, this is StarTropics&quot;)<br />3b- Why specify the same exact information twice in the header (&quot;This is Titanic 1912 ... oh, and just in case you weren't paying attention, this is Titanic 1912&quot;)<br />3c- I'd repeat myself for all the S?ROM games, but ugh.<br /><br /><br />Finally, despite your complaint: The reason the NES 2.0 submappers haven't been deployed is EXCLUSIVELY because there isn't a ROM set that uses them. That's it. Nothing less, nothing more.<br /><br />Anyway, Nintendulator already uses PRG RAM size to determine MMC1 behavior and the presence of RAM presence to handle Low G Man. And MESS implements everything as on the wiki ... except for MMC3, because I didn't decide on anything (other than that kevtris's recommendations were inadeuate) until after etabeta implemented things.

My opinion is that the implementation of a mapper should be selected exclusively by the mapper+submapper number, rather than adding a weirdo &quot;look elsewhere in the file&quot; rule wherever we could possibly save a submapper. It's a bad precedent that complicates the specification. I think it's more important to have a consistent use of fields in the specification than it is to eliminate every possible redundancy from them. I also think that making this arbitrary decision to change the method of mapper selection specifically breaks continuity with kevtris' earlier attempt to establish this specification, which I think is a bad thing. The spec can be functional either way, I suppose, but it was already started in the <em>other</em> way. We've also applied this change inconsistently (&quot;deprecation&quot; for mapper 1, complete reassignment for mapper 4), which makes it even worse.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">lidnariq wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">Finally, despite your complaint: The reason the NES 2.0 submappers haven't been deployed is EXCLUSIVELY because there isn't a ROM set that uses them.

The problem as I'm looking at it is that it's not practical for anyone looking at the wiki page to understand 1. <strong>what is this submapper for?</strong> and 2. <strong>do I want to implement it?</strong>. These are important questions for an implementer, and it's not reasonable to make someone read hundreds of forum posts and wiki pages to learn these things. I made a proposal on the wiki about <a href="http://wiki.nesdev.com/w/index.php/Talk:NES_2.0_submappers#Major_revision_proposal" class="postlink">how to allocate new submappers in the future</a>, but here are two immediate changes I would very strongly suggest:<br /><br />1. Move anything that is speculative (e.g. wishlist, incomplete draft, etc.) off the article. The article should be <strong>a list of things that can be implemented now</strong>, not a nebulous warning of the future.<br />2. For every submapper, <strong>list the games that require it</strong>. This answers both questions I posed above.<br /><br />If we did this, a new user (like me) looking at the article would be able to understand exactly why each submapper exists, what games to look at to test and understand the problem, and can evaluate whether it's even important for them to support those particular games. It would solve the chain of authority problem we're having by making the rationale for the submappers completely opaque.<br /><br />The <a href="http://wiki.nesdev.com/w/index.php/Talk:NES_2.0_submappers#Major_revision_proposal" class="postlink">proposal for how to add new submappers</a> was basically to maintain this standard of disclosure going forward, and to establish a process for evaluating it and maintaining continuity.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Analogy first: if I have a database table with configuration records, I'd much rather looking up a single record by primary key then by matching all the properties. PK is guaranteed unique, combination of field values are not necessarily so.<br /><br />for iNES 1.0 roms, mapper is determined by major mapper # and deriving the particular variant by properties of the game. the is accepted as necessary but terrible right? The whole point of submappers for 2.0 was to avoid that business. Why ignore that in favor of a more complex method? If a major mapper # isn't sufficient to determine configuration, I'd rather have an explicit value telling me what it should be rather than trying to scope it out from one or more other properties. <br /><br />And secondly, if there are some cases where we deem submapper necessary, the submapper should be the go-to for all cases where the major mapper isn't enough. Consistency is important. Submappers can define every variation ram+other properties that could ever be needed. Is the reverse guaranteed? I think you'd have a hard time proving that true. <br /><br />Really if we settle on submappers as the authority, ram units will likely be redundant in many cases. I'm ok with that- it's easy enough to disregard in case a submapper is given. There may still be cases where it's useful, e.g. no submapper specified but the rom expects some amount of ram. <br /><br />So in summary: explicitness and consistency are priority, and flexibility should also be maintained.

The implementer can choose how to handle this, it's not important for us to specify what happens in response to every possible header, only what happens in response to well-formed headers.<br /><br />My primary objection to the change is that I think the mapper functions like what registers do should always be specified in the same place. My secondary objection is that it contradicted the precedent kevtris' original implementation set.<br /><br />I presumed the PRG-RAM size field is to differentiate mappers that have the same register set but different PRG-RAM sizes, just like there are plenty of mappers with the same or compatible registers sets but different PRG-ROM sizes (e.g. MMC3 with no PRG-RAM vs MMC with PRG-RAM). That's what its purpose looks like to me, at first glance, but you are asking for it to also be part of the selection of register function (as well as other size fields).<br /><br />What I actually propose is that we should have <em>both</em> in the spec. Put a submapper for each of the MMC1 size variants, and for MMC6, and advise that both should be specified together. An implementer can choose to override the submapper choice with size fields if they choose, or vice versa. The redundancy supports both approaches if the headers are well formed, and honestly I would not expect malformed headers to be a problem anyway (we actually have a central hub to disseminate information here, it's not like the iNES 1 days anymore).

At one point during the creation of a new mapper for the Action 53 project, <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/viewtopic.php?f=9&amp;t=9406" class="postlink">I was at that point</a>: &quot;I have a game in progress. Here are screenshots of the game running on an existing mapper with reduced features, as well as a spec and test ROM for a new mapper or submapper. Implementing the new mapper would allow all features to be implemented.&quot; Should someone in this situation obtain a compiler, learn C, and modify an existing emulator?

Moved any implementation that is unimplementable or speculative to a <a href="http://wiki.nesdev.com/w/index.php/NES_2.0_submappers/Proposals" class="postlink">proposal page</a>. This included stuff that was &quot;wishlist&quot;, merely trying to open discussion, or otherwise didn't have any submapper assignments or<br /><br />2. Added game examples for everything that I could find information on so far.<br /><br />3. Attempted to format everything in a consistent way.<br /><br />I believe these changes have made no actual change to the specification as-is, I'm merely trying to reorganize the information. Tepples did change the MMC3 assignment, which was a response to my request, but otherwise everything is the same. My intent is that the wiki page should always be <em>ready for implementation</em> and that proposals and future changes should be done elsewhere.
