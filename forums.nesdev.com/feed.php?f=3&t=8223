The $2007 read buffer should only be accessed/modified by $2007 reads. The rest of the PPU hardware should be functionally unaware of that buffer, as it has it's own hardware set aside for rendering purposes.<br /><br />Otherwise, I could see all sorts of weird bugs occurring. If the PPU modified that buffer, and the program did some tricky reads via $2007 during rendering, for example.<br /><br />Also, I often find it very helpful to consider things from an NES programmer's perspective.

I am just wondering whether in my emulator, can I use the same buffer for $2007 reads by the CPU and for VRAM reads triggered by the scanline rendering. <br />Knowing how PPU works either way would be helpful.<br />Using the same buffer would make the emulator a bit shorter and less filled with special cases, so there is the motive. But I don't want to do it if it means making the emulator less accurate.<br />Telling me what a game programmer should do or not do on the NES platform really does not help me in this question, though I appreciate the effort; it may be valid documentation for others. It's just not something that addresses my question.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=5043">Bisqwit</a> — Fri Oct 21, 2011 4:24 pm</p><hr />

It's useless to rely on that read regardless of whether the PPU initializes the buffer to a known state or not, because that value is irrelevant to your program. Say it returns a garbage value after reset, it should be obvious that you can't rely on a random (or pseudo-random) value for anything other than a seed for a RNG (typically). Say it's initialized to 00h, what good does that do you? Either way, the $2007 read buffer is just that, a buffer for PPU $2007. It's only use is to interact with PPU memory, and it's not directly modifiable.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=4320">beannaich</a> — Fri Oct 21, 2011 2:04 pm</p><hr />

It's internal to the PPU, and the PPU only seems to use it to buffer reads to external memory.
