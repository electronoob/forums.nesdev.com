And the third revision is on the way.  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt=":roll:" title="Rolling Eyes" /> 
<br />There are some pics <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/sd2snes" class="postlink">here.</a>
<br />
<br />Currently there's only Map 0x20, 0x21, and 0x25 support with near-time SRAM save.
<br />
<br />I think the next step will be DSP-1 emulation.
<br />
<br />There's a 200kgate Spartan 3 on the board which can be replaced by its pin compatible 400kgate variant, which should definitely be sufficient for chip emulation in case the former is not enough.

<br />nice.  Bonus points for the SD card interface.  How long does it take games to load? Say, what is the figure on a 32mbit ROM?
<br />
<br />Looks to be a very capable cart, I'm wondering how much that SRAM is costing though =(
<br />
<br />The fat FPGA is a huge plus, I'm guessing that's your main draw.  Playing starfox on the real deal with a flash cart would be wicked.

ATM the AVR uses its SPI to load a block from the card, then uses the same SPI to push it to SRAM via the FPGA. With the data flowing directly to the FPGA I have direct SRAM access (no shared SPI) and could achieve higher SPI clocks (currently 6.144MHz).<br />EDIT: to clarify, this is possible with a software update as the FPGA is already connected to the SPI bus.<br /><br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">Looks to be a very capable cart, I'm wondering how much that SRAM is costing though =(<br /></div><br /><a href="http://search.digikey.com/scripts/DkSearch/dksus.dll?Detail&amp;name=428-1860-ND" class="postlink">Quite a lot. :/</a><br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">The fat FPGA is a huge plus, I'm guessing that's your main draw.

But by using some sort of memory that doesn't require you to refresh it like SRAM or PSRAM all you have to worry about then is a BIOS, Source for loading data and Memory Mapping functions for your device. So atleast you'd have one less thing to worry about.

<br />SRAM cost is clearly going to be killer (hope you got a decent quantity discount) but surely it would make stuff like SFX/SA-1 high speed ROM / RAM access easier to implement.  I think I read in the docs that SA-1 runs at 10mhz when it has ROM or RAM to itself.

<br />
<br />Frankly I did not pay too much attention to cost. I don't have the guts nor time for commercial distribution anyway; being in Germany only makes it harder, with a f*ckton of regulations to meet. I do intend to release the source and gerber files at some point. (GNU GPL or similar)
<br />
<br />Actually I need more than 7.2MHz of random access throughput. SuperFX and SA1 (among others) have separate buses for ROM and RAM which can be accessed simultaneously. e.g. while the SuperFX has the RAM for itself, the SNES can still access the ROM freely.
<br />
<br />My board has only one memory bus so I need at least three time slices per "master clock" (roughly: AVR, SNES, GSU). With the FPGA maxed out at ~100MHz and an estimated 11 clocks per SDRAM access using autorefresh and autoprecharge, it would be a bit of a stretch. EDIT: This may be inaccurate, I haven't looked into the various SDRAM datasheets for quite some time now.
<br />
<br />How many clock cycles does the SA-1 need for memory access? "The Documentation" does give some numbers for the SuperFX but not for the SA-1...
<br />
<br />However, I'm considering it maybe for next year. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" /> I like the idea as SDRAM is dirt cheap and having a single 64M or 128M chip instead of four 16M chips would save a lot of space. I'm kind of an FPGA noob so I need some time to make myself comfortable.
<br />
<br />EDIT: I was a bit off, loading a 32Mbit ROM currently takes about 21 seconds.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />The SuperFX is actually the simpler chip. It has a switch to toggle access between the S-CPU and GSU accessing ROM or RAM. The SuperFX2 side can access the ROM/RAM at 5 clocks per fetch, or 21.47MB/s / 5. But it also caches instruction reads in a 256-byte window, and can fetch from it at the full 21.47MB/s. If you aren't concerned with high accuracy, games should still work okay if you omit the instruction cache, they'll just run a little slow and music will end too quickly in some games.
<br />
<br />The SA-1 is the real bastard. It can access ROM, I-RAM and the I/O registers at the full 10.74MB/s. It can access BW-RAM at 5.37MB/s. But both the S-CPU and SA-1 share the memory at the same time. There is a bus contention chip inside the SA-1 that detects this, and it will stall out the SA-1 until the S-CPU is done accessing it, as it obviously can't delay the S-CPU's request.
<br />
<br />It's not the two chips accessing the same address at the same time that is a problem, but both accessing the same chip at the same time that will make SA-1 reads take longer.
<br />
<br />So to get both of these right with only one SRAM chip, you'll need some crazy fast SRAM and some logic to determine which emulated memory chip each device is accessing at which time.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Thank you for the details, byuu.
<br />So let me think.. my FPGA logic is currently running @86.02MHz, using 6 clocks for one SRAM access cycle, resulting in roughly 70ns per cycle or 14.336 Mwords/s. (Data width is 16bit on the SRAM side, which might be beneficial.) My SRAM is 55ns so there should be some headroom.
<br />
<br />With FastROM, cycle length appears to be ~280ns, meaning I can do four 16-bit transfers "at 14.336MHz" each, with the first one being the S-CPU access to meet the required 120ns with some margin.
<br />
<br />The documentation states that with the SA-1, the S-CPU must run at 2.68MHz, so I have ~372 ns between two S-CPU accesses which is enough to serve the S-CPU and run four more SA-1 cycles at full speed. Pausing the "virtual" SA-1 when a new S-CPU cycle is detected should not be too hard.
<br />Having only one bus, I would also have to stall the SA-1 when they are not trying to access the same regions, where the original SA-1 would allow true parallel access (e.g. S-CPU -&gt; BWRAM, SA-1 -&gt; ROM). Resulting in only 7.16MB/s in this case. Damn! Does this happen a lot?
<br />
<br />I-RAM (2kBytes iirc?) and registers (and the SFX's cache) will be implemented inside the FPGA as block RAM or maybe even distributed RAM.
<br />
<br />But first things first, which will be an emulated DSP-1 in some sort of soft core. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />

<br />
<br />that's a shame, I'd definitely be one of the guys willing to fork out for something as cool as this.  I say that as a gamer/homebrewer though.
<br />
<br />You said you want to release the source files at some point, and though I had to google what a gerber file is, it looks like I'd be able to produce a cart for my own use with these files.  I wouldn't mind having one or two of these for personal use, what type of money would I be looking to spend to make it actually happen if you have any ideas? Where would I have to order from and what potential difficulties would I run into? Just curious, it'd be great to have something like this for myself even if you won't be handling the production yourself.
