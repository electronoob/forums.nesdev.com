<br />
<br />I recall that I've read in some old computer mags that devs of ports of arcade hits to home computers often had nothing but the access to the arcade unit to work with, and sometimes it was just video recording of the gameplay. No source code, design docs, etc. Sometimes video recording was used to get the original graphics as base to draw on.

<br />
<br />What port was this? On PS1 and Sega Saturn they did not scale the graphics or anything like that. But on SNES and Genesis the graphics were not the same as the arcade due to the 256x224 resolution which was not only used because SNES was limited to it (Genesis could do 320 width) but also because it takes less cartridge memory to store the "scaled down" graphics. I think it's wrong to assume they ran it through a program and scaled the graphics down. They just took the source art and redid it for the 256x224 screen space of the 16bit consoles. And it turned out very well. Also PC-Engine/Turbografx uses the same graphics, the same resolution, even though the console could actually run in the native Arcade resolution or atleast one more similar to the 32bit console ports. But it didn't as the larger graphics would again require much more memory to store.

<br />They might've used a scaled down version as a reference when redrawing the background and characters.
