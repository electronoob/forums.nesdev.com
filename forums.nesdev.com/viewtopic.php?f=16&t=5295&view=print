<br />I want your comment on the new layout since I changed the way things are organized a little bit.  I hope to change the content more once I can figure out a proper layout to make it more user friendly.
<br />
<br />Now I'm exhausted after moving the section around so I will go sleep. zzz...

<br />- if a specific scanline is mentioned, is that with vblank thought of as before or after the visible frame?
<br />
<br />something else: would it be worthwhile to reformat some of the text files on the nesdev main page into the wiki? Not necessarily things like marat's doc, but Brad Taylor's CPU/PPU documents. The cpu page currently (or at least the last time I looked) just had a link to an opcode matrix and a pinout. To make a long story short (too late?), moving some of the longer plain text stuff to a web format (wiki) would be better especially so one doesn't need to find the right encoding or font to see charts and stuff.

As long as it's nesdev related, I don't see any issue. Any information is good information, if people don't agree they will update it or comment about it. We just have to make sure that the new content is organized when possible.  If is a code sample, it should be in the getting started section (which I need to start building an example of the structure inside).  <br /><br />The next step is to improve the current content. That will take more time but I will try.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">Hangin10 wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">There should be some standards so that information can be easily understood. </div><br /><br />I totally agree. This is one point to make the wiki more user friendly and not just for the "ones that already know". <br /><br />So what we have to do is to define the assumption for the user. For example, in the main page we could say that the content refer to NTSC machine unless otherwise noted. All assumption should be documented.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">Hangin10 wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">something else: would it be worthwhile to reformat some of the text files on the nesdev main page into the wiki?</div><br /><br />Yes, I was thinking about that already.  I hate the fact that I cannot search when many of the content is in outside links.  What doesn't exit in the wiki that has value and , the most important point, is still accurate (since many docs are maybe not) must be inserted in the wiki.  Then, a link to the original content could be inserted at the end of the page to say that is refer to this doc. If it just a snippet like a diagram for a chip, it may not be required.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">Hangin10 wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">To make a long story short (too late?), moving some of the longer plain text stuff to a web format (wiki) would be better especially so one doesn't need to find the right encoding or font to see charts and stuff.</div><br /><br />I didn't think about the encoding, that's a valid point.

<br />
<br />I see your point but not everyone know.  Some people come to nes dev and doesn't have that background. By clarifying the assumption at the beginning, which is only a few line of text or a specific section that can explain all assumption if there is too many or explained at page directly, you already make the learning curve less steep and make it more user friendly.  It the kind of small details that your user will always appreciate.

<br />
<br />So the wiki transfer is done. Only thing left is a logo. From the current structure I started, people can start giving their opinion about what they like (or don't) about it.
<br />
<br />I did one small "doh" when I was tired yesterday. For some reason, I removed the category for a few articles (mailly mappers) because I didn't like the fact that mappers and board were mixed together (they're not the same thing).  But now I realize that if I end up from a search engine on a specific mapper page, I don't know how to go back to the main category. I will try to find a way to fix that. Either the word mapper will be highlighted and you can go back to the mapper page or adding some category for specific group only.  But not all page were organized that way so actually I found one issue that affect many pages (i.e. how to go back to the main topic, if any).
<br />
<br />But still, those are minor details and can be corrected soon. 
<br />
<br />Welcome to the new home of the nesdev wiki.  If you have any issue with the wiki, there are 3 admins: Tepples, Memblers and me. This way, if for some reason something goes wrong with it and I'm not available, other admin can proceed forward.

<br />
<br />Now here something new that I wanted for a long time: a <strong>local html copy</strong> of the site is available <a href="http://wiki.nesdev.com/wikiDump/NESdevWiki_20090613.7z" class="postlink">here</a>.  For now, this is an experimental dump since the extension doesn't work 100%.. I had to fix the layout by end but it seems to work.  Some people may be annoyed that I compressed it in 7z but if I did with zip file.. Instead of 200k it was 1 meg!.. 
<br />
<br />Page without links will be missing since you don't have access to the specials pages. Once we put all the article together, we could do a dump once in a while, unless nobody is interested but I would be surprised.
<br />
<br />If everyone could test the local copy and found what is wrong, tell me what they like or not, I would really appreciate it.

<br />I actually do most NES programming when I have free time at work, which is a place where I am not connected to the internet.  So an offline version of the wiki is actually pretty sweet for me personally.  I've been carrying around a lot of printouts stapled together, which makes my backpack heavier than it needs to be.

<br />
<br />hmm, that reminds me...
<br />Has anyone ever had the idea of creating a "quick reference card" for the NES (like there is for unix commands, apache and a lot more stuff, even GB programming) that fits on a single (or just a few) sheets of paper? Always liked them. They make nice posters, too. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />More on-topic:
<br />Maybe it would be helpful to have a database of commercial and homebrew nes games in the wiki? E.g. each entry could have:
<br /><ul>- general information on the right side like company, release date, - mapper used, prg and chr size and possibly more<br />- info for emulator developers: emulator requirements, things to pay attention to<br />- put a link to the corresponding entry at <a href="http://datacrystal.org" class="postlink">http://datacrystal.org</a> somewhere for ram/rom locations and a list of hacks</ul>
<br />Likely not enough points to warrant an article for each game, but maybe a single page for difficult-to-emulate games?
<br />I just like having easily accessible in-depth info about games around. From a nesdev point of view that doesn't seem to make much sense, though, except for emulator developers.
<br />
<br />Well, it's just an idea.

Maybe the not organized one yet will just be set temporary in the getting started section until they can be put at the right place.<br /><br />The idea of a local version came to me because of 2 factors. Recently, the wiki was down randomly so it was annoying to not have access to the content when you really wanted it. That fix the first issue. The second one is I remember Tepples saying that he was programming while commuting (i.e. no internet access) so in that case, a local version is quite useful.<br /><br />With a local version, "printer friendly" sections are less useful but we can still make them for people that prefer paper.  Before you get rid of your paper version, make sure that all the content you need is there. <br /><br />Now we need to go through the content of nesdev files and add everything that is missing and is useful.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">miau wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">hmm, that reminds me...<br />Has anyone ever had the idea of creating a "quick reference card" for the NES (like there is for unix commands, apache and a lot more stuff, even GB programming) that fits on a single (or just a few) sheets of paper?

<br />
<br />I consider emu authors also nesdev developers since they contribute  emulators that will help for making new software so they should not be excluded. 
<br />
<br />Any information about software made is ok too.  It's not like we have any space restriction or something <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /> The only problem is always "who" will fill that information.  Nothing was going forward about the wiki (i.e. the waiting game) so I took the time and moved everything.  Now I need people to contribute if we want the idea to fly. It should not be a one man army thing.
<br />
<br />Regarding a list of commercial games with their specification, yes this is an idea because I wanted to find some details about X game and the bootgod database was down (now it just went back up).  I would be useful a simple list of game N uses mapper X, board type X, has Y ammount of rom etc, anything that can be useful. We could always get the list from the bootgod db then format it for the wiki. At the least it would be useful when the bootgod db is down.
