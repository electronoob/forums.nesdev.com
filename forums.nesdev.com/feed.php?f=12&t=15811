No needs to be impressive technically,if you look at overdrive 1, there is nothing impressive on the effects side, it is composed at 90% of hardware effects(intelligently used), but was very well paced, with very good transitions and a non less good music,you add some solid artworks, and all the ingredients are here to make a good demo and this is why it was so popular IMO .<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=6952">TOUKO</a> — Mon May 15, 2017 1:11 am</p><hr />

More cliché SNES hardware effects? <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_lol.gif" alt=":lol:" title="Laughing" /> Windowing is pretty cool if, again, it isn't entirely obvious.

The windowing could still be better though, as it's apparent that the window borders are being figured out computationally in some way instead of being entirely pre-made.<br /><br />Like Mode 7 though, I think it can be used in more creative ways. I wonder if you could use the two windows to save CPU time for rendering untextured polygons, where the two largest are window layers. You still have to find the edges though, and depending on if you're drawing from back to front or front to back, it could be a real pain in the ass.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=6683">Espozo</a> — Sun May 14, 2017 11:58 pm</p><hr />

Mode 7 is most often used as a rotoscaler but it's actually working off a generic transformation matrix. I'd say one of the less used effects is the ability to vertically shear images at the pixel level. The effect could possibly be combined with horizontal interrupts for more complex visuals but the timing on it might be tricky.<br /><br />Edit: By horizontal interrupts I meant mid-scanline interrupts, but perhaps something could be created using both?<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=7494">HihiDanni</a> — Sun May 14, 2017 2:29 pm</p><hr />

That's exactly what I was thinking. I'm sure you can use Mode7 really creatively if you're good and able to think out of the box. Something unique would be an effect that didn't actually LOOK like Mode7, since we're all used to the &quot;standard Mode7 look&quot; from all the games that used it, but I'm sure it can be utilized for much more unique ideas.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=7819">Sumez</a> — Sun May 14, 2017 2:09 pm</p><hr />

For example, you could make a 4bpp raycaster with sprites with Mode 7 for a textured floor and ceiling.

Demos are a bit of a strange thing, cause in order to appreciate them you need to actually know what's going on - but at the same time you also need to be able to entertain the audience who knows nothing about the hardware. I remember the winners of demoscene compos often being plain cutscenes with catchy music or funny animations rather than the ones that pushed the technical boundary of the system.<br />In the case of the SNES, Oerg866 has a good point that trying to figure out how to code stuff that could easily be done with Mode7 would be pretty superficial for a tech demo. Platform elitism is one of the dumbest things ever that gets only more dumb when people drag it up on the subject of 90s consoles in 2017. I would love to see what you can actually do with a SNES demo, as I think you could really have some impressive things that no other pre-3D console could pull off if you start getting really creative about it, just like the MegaDrive is doing its own thing.<br />I think the whole elitism thing on the demoscene extends to more than just platform elitism though, as there's always been this sense of friendly rivalry between groups. But like any other kind of friendly rivalry, things can get heated and some people will come across as aggressive.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=7819">Sumez</a> — Sun May 14, 2017 10:36 am</p><hr />

I would probably be the Awkward Outsider though as I'm not from a PAL region (though I am interested in the possibilities afforded by the additional DMA headroom provided by the 50hz format). Even if I don't work on a demo though, I still want to work on software for the SNES. The PPU has some interesting bells and whistles. I can render VSTs from Renoise and import them straight to the SNES as game audio. That's really cool! The CPU is weird but I find it a fun challenge to work with (it also helps that despite any awkwardness, I can still do 16-bit arithmetic which really does wonders). I also hope that maybe I can help other people realize the joy of developing for this weird machine.

NTSC was even widely used in Brazil in rental VHS tapes (maybe as a crude form of copy protection, since most VCRs couldn't record NTSC? I don't know...).</div>There are PAL-M C64s, they are called &quot;Drean&quot; which was the name of the Argentinean company that made and sold them. This gives the follow sets <div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">Machine         Clocks/Lines<br />PAL-I/G/B       63/312<br />NTSC R56A       64/262<br />NTSC R8         65/262<br />Drean           65/312</div><div class="quotetitle">tokumaru wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"><br /><div class="quotetitle">tepples wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">I read Oziphantom's comment as implying that the scene would think a Commodore 64 modded to output PAL60 or PAL-M is &quot;not real&quot;.<br /></div><br />Oh, I see... Well, I guess it's OK to include features in an emulator replicating mods that can be done on hardware, but developers targeting these special &quot;modes&quot; should know that their audience will be severely cut down due to the fact that most people can't or won't mod their hardware.</div>The point of making a 60hz PAL but with 63 clocks rather than 65 clocks was &quot;not real&quot; - and it would be to make the emulator experience better as if you view something that scrolls at 50hz on a 60hz machine it is going to be jerky. Adding Drean support helps this but doesn't help the vast library of existing games.</div><br /><br />Okay I've done some more research into this, there is no free lunch. PAL-60 is a lie. <br />Basically there is the 6526 PAL-N and the 6527 PAL-M but<br />PAL-N is 65/312 at 50hz so it still gives you 50fps<br />PAL-M is 65/262 at 60hz so it still gives you 60fps.<br />Now the PAL-M has the same number of clocks per frame as normal NTSC, so while it has the PAL colour encoding, it can't match a PAL machine, it is still lacking 2626 clocks. Its just a slightly better NTSC. <br />PAL-N while being the fastest machine, in that it will give you an extra 624 clocks per frame, not to be sniffed at, but it is still 50fps so you will still get the jerk on PC monitors.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=8250">Oziphantom</a> — Mon Apr 24, 2017 10:09 pm</p><hr />

I understand the impulsive reaction to try and recreate the exact same effects, to prove that &quot;the SNES can do it too&quot;, but ultimately, being creative and thinking of new ways to combine the things the SNES does best might give more interesting results, and will probably be less frustrating than trying to figure out how each effect was implemented.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=95">tokumaru</a> — Sun Apr 23, 2017 10:10 am</p><hr />
