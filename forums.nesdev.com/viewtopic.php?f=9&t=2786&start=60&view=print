<br />If you make your audio hardware output a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delta-sigma_modulation" class="postlink">delta-sigma modulated</a> signal on one pin, then you do have both. The DAC for ΔΣ is just an inverter (to remove noise) and a low-pass filter (to turn it into analog).

The filter will add serious slew rate, and break all the nice sounding of square wave. Maybe not, but I'm afraid it will. And most custom sound mapper uses very-low-slew-rate waveforms (at least MMC5 and VRC6, the most popular extra sound chips arround).
<br />
<br />Also I have no idea how complicated it is to split from standard digital sound (created inside a FPGA or so), to SDPCM sound (on a single pin).
<br />
<br />Oh, and in case M2 would be too slow there is always the CIC 4MHz clock... however it won't work on top-loaders, and any chances of getting it working on a famicom are gone.

This way people can develop their own mappers and upload them as simply as the ROM data. </div><br /><br />Good idea, but I would definitely pay more for the more expensive chip that emulates all.  I wouldn't even think twice about it.  Plus, the average joe user non-technophile would dig it more two.  Best bet?  Offer both.  Those with the cash can pay it.<br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"><br />I wouldn't touch FDS at all on this project if I were you. Even if you rewrote the BIOS, some FDS games perform disk I/O directly, so those games will still not work. Further, the user will need to be able to switch sides/disks during play, which would most likely require either a button on the cartridge or something plugged into the expansion port.</div>
<br />
<br />I think it would be acceptable to just make that an entirely different cart.  You would have to emulate the FDS the same way FDSLoadr does, only without a real RAM adapter on the NES side.  As for disk switching, you could make a physical switch if you felt you really had to emulate it (eject, flip), rather than use hot keys.  No one wants to get up and hit a switch, but back in my day we had to get up and flip disks around by ourselves uphill both ways in the snow, and we liked it!  Also, why rewrite the bios completely, when one could load the FDS Bios on there themselves?  I would imagine that could take a lot of work out of it.  Another option for hot keys would be to bring up a menu ala  Game Action Replay that displays the selectable disk sides and maybe some other info about the image.   Such a menu might be useful to show info on any game, really.
<br />
<br />But anyway, in FDSLoadr, You send a game to the RAM Adapter, and when you want to switch disk sides, you press 2 on the keyboard for side B (or 3 for side C or 4 for side D, etc)  and then space to send the side to the RAM adapter.
<br />
<br />But like I said, a seperate cart for FDS might be better, but just throwing some ideas out there.  I'd love to have a replacement for FDSLaodr, since it only works in true DOS, and it is somewhat limited.  USB would be nice too.

<br />The first order approximation involves eight flip-flops and one 8-bit adder. Each cycle, add the linear PCM value created by the sound emulation circuit to the internal register. If there is a carry out, produce a 1 on the output; otherwise, produce a zero. Commercial implementations use noise shaping to move more of the noise into frequencies above 20 kHz.

As long as only 2 MMC5 channels are emulated, that means 5-bit adder and only 5 flip-flops. Sounds easy.<br />Since M2 oscillates at 1.5 or 1.7k, this will make plenty of pulses even for a 20kHz square wave (approximately 40 pulses per high or low state).<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">Slew rate will show up as a loss of high frequencies, similar to overload in DPCM, but CD players manage to pull it off as long as slew-related phenomena are kept above 20 kHz. </div>
<br />Yeah, after all even if there is some low-gabrage oscillation above 20kHz nobody will hear it exept cats and dogs (without counting that there is probably other filters from the NES output to the TV), so I think it's okay.
<br />This could be improved by increasing the filter's order, however I don't know if this is needed or not. I guess some test should be done on this before any implementation in hardware is done.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />As for flipping FDS disk sides, a button may not be enough unless a menu pops up.  Without a menu, a three bit switch could emulate up to 8 disk sides.  Iirc, the largest FDS game was 4 disks, but I could be wrong.  I'm sure there were 2 disk games and possibly 3. A 4 bit switch could leave open possibilities for experimental FDS dev work.
