The efficiency comes from:<br /><br />1. Careful composition with redundancy/repetition.<br />2. Exporting the data into an efficient form.<br />3. Diagnostic information about the export to inspect the size of data.<br />4. Lightweight driver implementing only the features you need.<br /><br />The NSF files produced by Famitracker are not the most efficient. It's feature-packed music driver is about 5k of NES code, for example, but there is nothing stopping you from writing an alternative driver, and an alternative export. Shiru did it with Famitone. I did it with my own project. The efficiency of the data depends on your custom export, it can be written to recognize and diagnose other kinds of redundancy. For example, you could write an exporter that automatically recognizes arpeggio patterns instead of building instruments for each. You could make a custom percussion instrument that interrupts triangle briefly while playing noise, so that in the output data it's only 1 &quot;note&quot; for each drum hit, even though in the Famitracker data it would be 2 notes across 2 channels. Etc.<br /><br />Famitracker gives you nearly complete control of all aspects of the NES APU, and immediate feedback with it. It's really not lacking at all as a way to produce efficient, game-shippable NES music.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=5165">rainwarrior</a> — Sun Sep 14, 2014 8:28 am</p><hr />

I'll compose the song in something else (to hear what it sounds like while I work on it), and then I'll manually implement the song in raw hex (but I cheat and use assembler labels/pointers too, taking advantage of the fact that the hex data gets assembled along with the rest of the project's code), and from there I'll tweak the engine-specific stuff like envelopes/waveforms/instruments/drum macros/etc.<br /><br />I dunno about the claim that the music from 25 years ago is substantially better than homebrew stuff today.

Yup, great series (and has English subtitles in case anyone reading these posts is wondering/dreading).<br /><br />I'd strongly urge <strong>anyone</strong> doing NES audio (including emulation), or any kind of NES development in general actually, to watch this series.  The commercial games that were made often involved <strong>manual effort</strong> -- few tools, often just entering raw hex data -- compared to the stuff that floats around the 'net today.  (Rephrased: we have better tools now than they did 25 years ago, yet the games made 25 years ago on a whole were still substantially better... ;-) )<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3">koitsu</a> — Sat Sep 13, 2014 9:58 am</p><hr />
