		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Simple question and almost sure about the answer but I just want to confirm it.
<br />
<br />TLROM board can support up to 512K of prg-rom, which I read from the wiki. If the original game contains a 28 pins 128k and you swap it for a 512k one with the right wiring, I guess it would work.  Is my assumption correct?
<br />
<br />The reason I asked this question is because in a previous thread, people where talking about NROM-128/256 and it got me worry that my future donor cart would not support what I want to do with it.
<br />
<br />I guess this thread will only have one answer and it will be over. Thanks for the information and sorry for asking such a simple question. I just want to remove doubts in my mind.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Although some T*ROM boards use 28-pin ROMs, they still have he extra 4 holes to support 32-pin ROMs.
<br />
<br />In the boards I tested, the 4 extra holes were correctly wired to support 32-pin chips, but I seem to remember someone saying that there were boards where this wasn't the case. I've never seen one of these though.
<br />
<br />So the answer to your question is: T*ROM boards were probably designed to support both 28-pin and 32-pin ROMs without modifications, meaning you could turn them into dev carts without worrying, but since once someone said that there were different boards, you'd better check how the 4 extra holes are connected in yours using a multimeter or some other tool that checks connections. I'd say you have a 99% chance of the board being prepared for the larger chips, but you can never be too careful.

<br />
<br />At first I was worried when I saw the image of the board I want to use on the bootgod database (<a href="http://bootgod.dyndns.org:7777/profile.php?id=2236" class="postlink">here</a>) since the last pins (from the front of the board) seems to all be connected to the same place. But after searching more, 256k game had the same board so it should not be an issue. It just seems that TLROM JP board and US board are a little bit different in design.

<br />
<br />Assuming that the CHIP is a standard nintendo one (and I don't see why it wouldn't be, even though the cart is japanese), you just have to worry about the holes I circled in red.
<br />
<br />We can clearly see that the bottom ones are VCC, because they are connected to the hole at their left, so these are correct. The top 2 should be connected to A18 and A17 on the MMC3. Check the the pinout of the MMC3 <a href="http://www.tripoint.org/kevtris/mappers/mmc3/index.html" class="postlink">here</a> so that you know which pins are those on the MMC3.
<br />
<br />There is some confusion regarding A17 and A18 of the MMC3 because the <a href="http://nesdev.com/rom.txt" class="postlink">document at the NESDEV page</a> seems to have them mixed up. I'm almost certain that this document is wrong, while the one at Kevin horton's page (linked above) is correct.

<br />
<br />I did open some carts (3 of them) but the one I did all got broken pins or bevel. Since they are dev carts I don't mind much but unless I can figure out how to open them without breaking the pins, I will not be able to provide anything to bootgod database.  
<br />
<br />Today I found Super Chinese world 3 in the junk bin, which is not in the db too. I may have a few that I could provide someday if I can find the trick.  The one with the security bits won't be an issue once I find the right bit or fix my custom screw driver (which doesn't work yet).  
<br />
<br />Anybody has a trick to open them without breaking the case?  Maybe I should start a thread about this since it may not get much attention in this one.
<br />
<br />Edit:
<br />
<br />Once I find a way to open them I will be more than happy to provide the images to the DB. I know there is one that you want to see and I will do my best once I receive the part or fix my screwdriver. If I could I would open it right away but I want to make sure to not break the case since I'm still a collector at heart.

<br />
<br />I tested it tonight with my board and Kevin's page indeed contains the right information.  Thanks Tokumaru! Does the wiki has the same issue as the document on nesdev?  If not, maybe it's time to take that document down and correct it?
<br />
<br />And Bregalad was right too. Good to know about the MMC3 as not issue for 512k. Thanks Bregalad!

<br />
<br />Here's one of my guess.  I saw that many manufacturers write their names on the chips so it could mean Technos Japan chip? hmmm... The game is US Championship volleyball so it could be possible.
<br />
<br />Edit:
<br />
<br />Maybe Technos Japan Corporation would make more sense.
