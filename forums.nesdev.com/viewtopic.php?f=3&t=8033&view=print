There was one instruction (STA 0x91) where I was adding the Y register value only to the low byte (bLow + Y) instead of adding Y to the adjusted value ( ( bLow + bHigh &lt;&lt; 8 ) + Y).  Whoops!!  That problem has been haunting me for months and months.  Thanks to those who provided input!  I can now play SMB!!
<br />
<br />-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<br />
<br />I have had the issue shown in this video for quite some time:
<br />
<br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pgJXhy81Nb4">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pgJXhy81Nb4</a><!-- m -->
<br />
<br />Several people have commented that I have a problem in my CPU code, so I was wondering if someone wouldn't mind looking over it to see if there were any obvious issues.  It's not perfect and some of the comments in it are old, but I am able to pass all the nestest, nestress and the 'official_only.nes' CPU tests.  It's still a work in progress.
<br />
<br />The screen to the right in the video is the four name tables.
<br />
<br />I'm a hobbyist programmer, so go easy on me.  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=":wink:" title="Wink" />
<br />
<br />Here is the CPU.cpp source file: 
<br />(link removed)
<br />
<br />Thanks!

<br />Just register content tracing should be good enough (PC, A, X, Y, S, Flags).  But if you're a fan of using diff software (like WinMerge), you'd need to make your trace match the format of another emulator's trace (or use a bunch of regular expressions to reformat the other emulator's trace).

<br />
<br />I actually already have some logging in my emu that outputs to a file.  I just removed it (along with some other code) from the .cpp file I linked so others didn't have to sift through the non-cpu code.
<br />
<br /><em><strong>Is there a particular emulator that outputs a nice log to a file?</strong></em>
<br />
<br />My emu currently logs like this:
<br />
<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">C5F5&nbsp; A2&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;A:00&nbsp; &nbsp;X:00&nbsp; &nbsp;Y:00&nbsp; &nbsp;P:24&nbsp; &nbsp;SP:FD</div>
<br />
<br />But it's very easy to add/change/remove to make a diff easier.  I usually just use Notepad++ with the Compare plugin.
<br />
<br />Thanks

<br />So some regular expressions, or a simple program could convert the logs to make them look the same.
<br />IRQ/NMI timing might make logs look slightly different.
<br />
<br />Also, it helps to turn on NTFS compression for the directory you save logs to, since logs quickly grow to 150+MB in size.

<br />That or use zlib to compress logs in .gz format, which will work even on file systems other than NTFS. If you have PNG screenshot support, you're already linking in zlib anyway.

<br />
<br />I tried these as I mentioned and maybe some other one-off tests:
<br />
<br />"nestest, nestress and the 'official_only.nes'"  &lt;- They all pass
<br />
<br />There are quite a few games that work fine and others that don't.  But many of the others seems like minor timing issues.  And none of the weirdness is that bad.

<br />Why is there data at address $07DC?  I was under the impression that when I read a rom, that the PRG contents are written to 0x8000-0xFFFF and the CHR contents are written into 0x0000-0x1FFF of VRAM (this is oversimplified, I know).  Aside from that, I thought there was no data that was placed into memory.  The readout from the CPU RAM of FCEUX has (0x00 0x00 0x00 0x00 0xFF 0xFF 0xFF 0xFF) repeating from address 0x0000-0x1FFF.

<br />
<br />I expect that, but there is nowhere before that point that the program has changed the data at that address.  What I pasted is the entire contents of the program up until that point (with the exception of waiting for VBlank).

<br />I took a break from logs to look at the RAM dumps from when the level starts.  It is obvious looking at the dumps that the objects (blocks, pipes, etc.) are being written to a different place in RAM.  They are off by 0x100.
<br />
<br /><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-MQi5r6opQXY/TkCzp96J2rI/AAAAAAAAAjQ/bFlyPSWOsRs/s640/dumps.jpg" alt="Image" />
<br />
<br />The items in the blue squares are the bricks and question blocks at the beginning of the level.  In both cases, I dumped the memory right after starting the game without moving.
<br />
<br />Now I just need to figure out why they are off?!
