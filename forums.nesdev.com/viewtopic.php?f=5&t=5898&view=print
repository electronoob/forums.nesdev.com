		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I don't usually discuss anime/manga much, but if I want to talk about a specific series I go to places that are specific to that series, I don't go to a generic place where all series are welcome, so I can't recommend anything.
<br />
<br />About drawing, I learned mostly from copying at first, and once I had done enough copying I had learned the basic "rules" and was able to come up with my own stuff. I guess you should pay attention to the different styles and try to replicate some of them, but in the end you shouldn't rely on memory or formulas to draw, or your drawings will be very repetitive. Hopefully you will learn how to draw instead of memorizing how things should be drawn.
<br />
<br />I started 15 years ago though (I did draw before that, but that was when I switched to manga style), so it's not a very quick thing to learn, specially if you aren't used to drawing at all.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />You shouldn't learn to draw in a manga style. You should just learn to draw, realistically and when you're good enough, you'll be able to draw in most styles and be more versatile than if you start with a manga style which has improper proportions and will put you in habits that will be hard to break. 
<br />
<br /><!-- w --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.conceptart.org">www.conceptart.org</a><!-- w --> is a great forum. Starting a sketchbook there or posting a specific work you're having trouble with in the critique section will get you sound advice.
<br />
<br />They don't specialize in manga, but they can certainly help you become a better artist, and that style will come naturally.
<br />
<br />Also, there's this guy's series of videos: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BsQ1WVyPHvU">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BsQ1WVyPHvU</a><!-- m -->
<br />
<br />He focuses heavily on the basics to see the flat paper as a 3D landscape and gives you good exercises to do to get better no matter what artistic path you take.
<br />
<br />Unless you already can draw well, and are asking about tutorials for making serial art (comics/actual manga/storyboards/things like that) that flow well. In which case <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Making-Comics-Storytelling-Secrets-Graphic/dp/0060780940" class="postlink">this is a great book.</a>
<br />
<br />As for places to discuss manga and anime, I don't have any idea either.

<br />
<br />If you're trying to find recommendations for good series then I can come up with a few (though only for anime). My choices might be a bit outdated since I haven't watched any anime in a long time, but they are all good series if you haven't seen/read them:
<br />
<br /><strong>Death Note</strong> (drama/thriller)
<br /><strong>Gantz</strong> (sci-fi/action/thriller)
<br /><strong>Code Geass</strong> (sci-fi/action/comedy)
<br /><strong>Shura no Toki</strong> (periodical action/comedy)
<br /><strong>Tohai Densetsu Akagi</strong> (thriller/gambling)
<br /><strong>Cowboy Bebop</strong> (sci-fi/action/comedy)
<br /><strong>Haibane Renmei</strong> (drama/comedy)
<br /><strong>Keroro Gunso</strong> (sci-fi/comedy)
<br /><strong>Great Teacher Onizuka</strong> (comedy)
<br /><strong>City Hunter</strong> (action/comedy)
