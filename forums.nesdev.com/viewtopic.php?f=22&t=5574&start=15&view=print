<br />
<br />I'm sure you will. You already have a lot of code that can be re-used in your next game (game ai, animation of sprite etc). Once you get in your engine a way to scroll you're map, you're ready to go. And it's has nothing to do with MMC3: my demo in it's current state would run without a mapper at all if I wanted to.  You can always ask me question if there is something that you want to know on how I did it.  
<br />
<br />Now the scroll is working fine because the actor movement is 1 pixel per frame. Once I add 1.25 at the velocity... I guess I will have to fix a lot of limit bugs..
<br />
<br />@everyone:
<br />
<br />By the way, is there any other homebrew that actually scroll like what I'm trying to do for my MM9 proof of concept except for sack of floor wich is in nbasic? I want to check how they do it for velocity.  For now I have a blank and can't remember one homebrew with source.

<br />
<br />You know, despite that Sivak has already made one, I'm working on a game that doesn't scroll like his.  It's not due to difficulties in writing tiles in real time, it's because the game I am trying to emulate doesn't scroll either. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />  It's all a matter of style.

I use the same parameters as MM2 since they said many time that the game was based on this one.  Here's the <a href="http://www14.ocn.ne.jp/~banshaku/misc/MM9Project_2010-01-17.zip" class="postlink">2010-01-17 build</a>.
<br />
<br />@UncleSporky:
<br />The scrolling speed should now be up to par with MM9 or close.  Does it still feel like a slow start or it seems better? The count of frame before starting (feet move forward before running) was not adjusted, just the velocity.
<br />
<br />Regarding collision detection, I just added a quick hack before posting the file to block left and right a little bit. There is one bug were you can jump on top of something and MM will stay in the jump animation and I will fix it later.  My main goal was to fix the scrolling so it could accept more than 1 pixel per frame. It was hell and took a lot of re-factoring but now it seems to work.  It has more the MM feel and speed compared to before. It works on my famicom too.

<br />No, it still feels slow and weird to me.  For comparison, load up Megaman 6 and tap forward rapidly.  You'll see his leg bend first, but you'll also be able to inch forward.  In your engine all this accomplishes is wiggling his leg.

<br />Primarily it just takes a few frames too long for him to actually begin moving.

<br />
<br />Depending on which version of MM you play the delay before moving is different. MM6 does react a lot faster when you tap rapidly, I remember that.  I need to re-test MM9 to see how close is it to MM6.  If I remember well, you could tap very little and only the leg was moving, which I reproduced. If you did press a little bit longer, it started to move without walking but yes, it does feel "sticky" in a way.  Changing the delay is only one constant so I will try to reduce it and see how it goes.

<br />If you are actually treating it as a "delay", that might be the problem. I just checked all MM games, and in the first 2 he doesn't always move on quick button taps, but from 3 onwards he always does.
<br />
<br />No matter the game though, there is no delay in the programmatic sense of the word, it just happens that a fractional displacement is applied every time. So, in MM 1 and 2, even though he doesn't always move on quick taps, eventually he'll move a pixel if you tap the button enough times for the fractions to add up to a whole pixel.
<br />
<br />In your demo, we can tap forever and he'll never move, he'll just twitch the leg and remain on the same spot. So I suggest you should add another byte to the coordinates in order to handle the fractional parts, if you aren't already doing so.
<br />
<br />Other than that, things have improved a lot. Collision detection is much better and it's got a much better MM feel now. You just have to fix these walking issues.
