		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Regarding the mapper:  The main reason was indeed for the physical carts.  My last game, Mystic Pillars, used UNROM with 64kb of PRG ROM and that made for a cart that wasn't much more expensive than NROM.
<br />
<br />If I could use a more advanced mapper like MMC3, I would like to as the bank switched CHR seems very handy as does all the PRG capacity, but the only downside is that MMC3 would be expensive and I don't think people would want to shell out $50.  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />
<br />
<br />UOROM will get the job done.  The compression routines I recently implemented are coming in handy.

<br />This may be a little off-topic, but:
<br />I think the main advantage of CHR-RAM is you can change it at runtime, for example if you want random or custom generated tiles.
<br />CHR-ROM can't do this of course, but, its advantage is that you can have more than 1 bank (don't know up to how many) and switch between them so you can get more than 512 tiles.
<br />Also, with CHR-ROM you don't waste PRG-ROM or RAM, for storing tiles previous to loading them on VRAM.
<br />Hope this helps.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I've got some more things to consider on the CHR-ROM vs. CHR-RAM debate:
<br />
<br />If you use CHR-RAM you can also compress your tiles so that you can fit more data into less ROM. I think there was a thread here somewhere about a program for CHR-RAM compression that compressed graphics data down to around 70% of the original file size.  So a 256k UOROM, using that program, could store more data using the same size graphics file as an MMC1 with 128k PRG-ROM and 128k CHR-ROM.
<br />And it's more flexible, as games with CHR-ROM bankswitching are restricted to certain-sized chunks of data called banks (from as small as 1k on the MMC5 to the full 8k used with CNROM). CHR-RAM allows one to change not just each tile, but even the individual bits that make up each tile.
<br />
<br />The benefits of CHR-ROM are that it's usually easier to use and faster to change out what tiles the PPU can access. To switch out CHR-ROM banks all you have to do is change some bits in the mapper. Changing the data in CHR-RAM, however, requires lots of time and also a routine to load the data in to the RAM. The speed also allows one to do certain effects that would be impossible with CHR-RAM, like using a raster interrupt to change which tiles are displayed on a certain part of the screen (for instance having different background tiles for the score area and the game play area). The bus between the 2A03 and the CHR-ROM is far too slow to update that much data in between scanlines.
<br />
<br />Oh and the amount of banks a certain cart with CHR-ROM has is the total ROM size divided by the bank size. Go look up different mappers in the Wiki for more information.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />UNROM really is a nice mapper, only problem I've ran into with it is the limited number of DPCM samples.  Garage Cart #2 is turning out to be quite a unique hack because of this (but so was the first one).
<br />
<br />I've always been a big fan of CHR-RAM.  GC#1 for example was 64kB.  One game on there (Solar Wars) was originally a 64kB game. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /> A little known fact also is that GC#1s menu uses bankswitched CHR-RAM (rather pointlessly though). 
<br />
<br />Another advantage of CHR-RAM is that it means there's half as many chips to program.  It can go straight from tube or reel to the board. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />
<br />
<br />It can be banked just as easily as CHR-ROM, and as I mentioned on the hardware forum, just like 8kB ROMs - you can't buy 8kB RAMs anymore either.  Though I actually have a nice reel of 8kB SMT RAMs, it's only because I'm a bargain hunter and get lucky sometimes. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" />

<br />
<br />Only problem is that original NES era mappers that supported bankswitched RAM are rare. The only one I can think of is CPROM and that board was limited to 32k PRG-ROM, which isn't that much if you want to take full advantage of the extra RAM. So this means that you pretty much have to make your own mapper if you want bankswitched CHR-RAM support, and the new mapper will probably need a new iNES mapper number to be emulated (though this would be a benefit for someone who wants to sell real carts without being pirated). It does make programming harder if you can't use an emulator to test your code.
<br />
<br />You know what, I am going to make a thread in the Newbie Help Center about the pros and cons of banked CHR-ROM, normal CHR-RAM, and banked CHR-RAM.

<br />
<br />Dwedit: If you mean CHR, some (most or all?) MMC3 boards don't have the CHR write pin, you should be able to tell by looking at the bottom of the cart.  Seeing all the pins there would be a good sign.

<br />
<br />I don't really condone large CHR RAM outside of copiers though, it just seems like a huge waste of potential putting them in a fixed game cart, that's the whole point of ROMs! No matter what tricks people gain from CHR RAM, they could all be implemented with enough CHR ROM/a talented enough mapper. I think the only time where RAM is a real necessity is when you want to reprogram it for another game <img src="./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" /> So by all means make an awesome bankswitched CHR RAM game for PowerPaks, but please don't put non-reusable RAM in real carts when it really isn't needed. 
<br />
<br />Maybe this will put my point in perspective: a 6264 can be used for the CHR of a UNROM game or it can be used for the well over 100 FDS games, and millions of more possible CHR sets homebrew considered. Be efficient--save a RAM from a monotonous fixed existence.

<br />Unless you're letting the player edit tiles. Think of Mario Paint's stamp editor, or possibly a shooter maker. Or a game where the player can choose a style of hair and clothes, and you don't want to waste the 8 sprites per scanline on overlapping them as separate graphics. I'm preparing a wiki article about CHR ROM-exclusive effects.

I just think there's a certain threshold where it becomes justified to use RAM; where exactly that is, I don't know, but I think everyone would agree the best use of RAM is when it can be reused between games or is absolutely necessary, or both. My opinion would be completely different if CHR-RAM was internal to the system like most other consoles, it's the hardware waste that irks me.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />It was pretty necessary for my Glider game (advertising!  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" /> )  All of the cabinet/shelf/table/etc objects can be any size and placed anywhere.  All other vent/books/obstacle objects are fixed size but still placed anywhere.  They are too big to be sprites, but aligning them to 8x8 borders wouldnt work either.  I was already making my own board to be CopyNES flashable, so adding 32KB of CHR RAM switched in 8KB banks was easy.  Name tables are just filled sequentially and timed loops handle the bank switch.  I wrote picture copying, rectangle filling, line drawing code that would write to the correct tile/bank.
<br />
<br />The board could be used for anything else that needs both big PRG and banked CHR RAM.
<br />
<br />One side effect of my solution was the whole screen has to be 4 colors, because objects in the bg will overlap the 16x16 borders.  Stupid attribute table!   This isn't such a problem because the original Glider game is b/w so grayscale works.

<br />Yes, the MMC5 has features that came close to this, and altough it only supports CHR-ROM it have features that can get rid of most usual drawbacks of CHR-ROM.
<br />It would be possible to create a mapper that would feed the PPU with customized tiles as it fetches pattern/name tables, the MMC5 doesn't do exactly that, but comes pretty damn close, changing almost all adress lines of the CHR-ROM as the PPU does that.
<br />
<br />If you have a mapper that would allow up to 2^128 bits of CHRROM, then you can do every possible combination possible. Come on it's only twice the number of rice you have to put on the last panel of a checkerboard (if you start at 1 and double the amount on each panel).
