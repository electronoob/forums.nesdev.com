		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />This is pretty much the only technical forum I frequent, so I figure I'll ask here.<br /><br />I'm looking for a piece of sync software that might do some or most of the following (in order of importance).<br />1. Sync automatically. I open a file, make a change and save. Open it on the other computer and the change is there without me having to click a &quot;re-sync&quot; button or anything.<br />2. Preserve date created, and date modified. This seems to be a tall order, since even copying files directly to/from a removable drive seems to destroy dates created.<br />3. Be relatively easy to add new folders to sync. Allow me to sync folders of an unlimited size.<br />4. It should be easy to set up in the first place, but I'm definitely not adverse to a super complicated but one time setup.<br />5. Free software is cool, but not free is good too if it does everything else.<br /><br />For those familiar, I'm looking for something like <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/" class="postlink">Dropbox</a> except that I would like dates created preserved, and I do not care about &quot;the cloud&quot; benefit and the space limitations that come with it. Ideally it would work through just the home network. I ask here because there are over 9,000 sync programs. I'm hoping that someone here already happens to use one that does these things that they are happy with, otherwise I guess I really will just have to try them all.<br /><br />Edit: I guess I should mention both computers are Windows, and I don't care about cross platform compatibility at all.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />So you want something like rsync that works on a Windows LAN and preserves the mtime (last modification date) and birthtime (creation date) of each file.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">Kasumi wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">Allow me to sync folders of an unlimited size.</div><br />To make this work, you would need to run this software on a server with unlimited storage space. And if a share can be accessed through the Internet (which you say you don't really need), both the server and each client would need unlimited data transfer to and from the Internet. With even wired home ISPs instituting monthly caps, the latter is becoming harder and harder to get.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">Ideally it would work through just the home network.</div><br />How would each computer find the other computers with syncable folders, especially as these computers' IP addresses change? Or does your &quot;super complicated but one time setup&quot; include installing DHCP reservations through the router appliance's administration interface?

I will obviously be limited by the harddrive space of the computers involved.<br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">How would each computer find the other computers with syncable folders, especially as these computers' IP addresses change? </div><br />The hope is that the software will figure that out, as dropbox does, or software like <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=35460" class="postlink">Mouse without borders</a> does. <br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">Or does your &quot;super complicated but one time setup&quot; include installing DHCP reservations through the router appliance's administration interface?</div><br />It probably doesn't include that, because I am rather clueless about networking things in general. If my lack of knowledge in that area is keeping me from doing this, I'm certainly open to learning.
