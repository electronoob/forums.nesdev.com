While creating a .nsf of "Yuushi no Monshou", I was wondering:<br /><br />When several memory areas are set to the same bank, should a write to one of them affect the others as well? For example, if both 6xxx and 7xxx are set to bank 0, will a write to 6001 also change the value of 7001? VirtuaNES and FCE Ultra seem to think "no", whereas NotsoFatso and Nintendulator seem to think "yes".<br /><br />I would prefer the "no" behavior, because it allows for some space-saving tricks for games that have their music code scattered in small bits throughout the whole 6000-DFFF address space. Also, a real FDS doesn't have "banks", it just loads data from a disk, so I imagine a write to 5FFx to simulate a read from the "virtual disk", as opposed to a real bank switch that sort of moves the "window" into a larger memory space, as is the case with ROM-based games.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=133">NewRisingSun</a> — Mon Jan 16, 2006 10:17 am</p><hr />
