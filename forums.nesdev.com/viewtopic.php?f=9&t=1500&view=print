		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I followed the directions for TKROM &gt; TNROM conversion, and I used an early run Mario 2 cart. The game runs, but the graphics are heavily scrambled. Even weirder, the game has to be reset before it works at all- I get a completely blank screen otherwise. I cut the necessary traces as per the instructions, and I verified that the traces were cut using a multimeter. I've also checked my wiring twice.
<br />
<br />    Any clue as to what's going wrong here?

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I've made a number of devcarts including TLROM, TKROM and TSROM. I have found that most MMC3 games will work on any MMC3 cart except that games with RAM need the TKROM board and those with CHR-RAM need TGROM. Whenver I had trouble I checked the connection of each pin of the EPROM to wherever it was supposed to connect to on the edge connector or MMC3 chip. Try using a light touch on the multimeter leads as sometimes the solder doesn't wet the EPROM socket pin and you get an intermittent connection. This can cause some odd behaviour such as pressure on a solder joint making the connection momentarily.  Also make sure the various leads of the EPROM such as PRG are connected to Vcc or ground as the data sheet suggests. You may try a different dump too as I have found many ROM's which work on emulators but not on the NES perhaps because of op-codes which are invalid.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />If you put FF3 on a TSROM based cart, you added the battery youreslef, right ? Be sure you didn't do anything wrong there. If you didn't had battery, the game will perfectly runs, but when you shut the power off, all saves will be lost. I doubt you could beat the game without turning the power off once (you will still be able to save, in case of if you get game over).
<br />
<br />If the graphics are wrong, you probably did something wrong with CHRRAM. I think you had to glue a pad, and that should be hard to get good contact without short-circuit other pads. You may also did some stupid error on wiring the chip, like cutting the track one pin early or late, leaving it floating or place a wire one pin early or late, causing signal conflicts.

<br />you need ONLY modifi CHROM to VRAM. And Connect BATTERY to WRAM.

<br />It seems the chr /RD and /A13 are flipped around. Which one is correct? Also where would you go abouts getting the propper vram chip? From other NES carts, or is there a specific part number you can buy?

I think I messed up something important when I was cutting the traces, so I'm just going to toss the board I have and wait an eternity to find another TSROM-01 version of Mario 2. (Were there ANY other games that used this early version of the board?) Next time I try this, it'll be done entirely through lifted pins because I hate having to cut traces.
<br />
<br />     At least I didn't actually kill a copy of Mario 2 for this, as I moved the mask ROMs over to a TSROM-04 board salvaged from Home Alone.
