You could do something awful with timed code to display only the top 4 scanlines of each nametable row and reduce that to 3² + 10² + 10, but that's <em>definitely</em> extra bonus showing-off effort.

IMO, the 8x8 tiles are very small and would leave too much negative space on the playing field.

For the demo, I plan on doing nothing. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" alt=":(" title="Sad" /><br /><br />I've got a friend who's pretty good with Famitracker, and he made <a href="https://dl.dropbox.com/u/6447287/picross.nsf" class="postlink">this .nsf</a> for me after playing an earlier demo. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /> Hopefully the final version will have this and other tracks.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I just tried the demo, it looks nice! Congrats.<br /><br />I was annoyed by the level select cursor too, nice to know this is fixed.<br /><br />And I was troubled by puzzles 5 and 7 having multiple solutions too, and also some in random mode, which is even more of a problem, since you have a probability of loosing a life point. And I guess puzzles with multiple solution can be really annoying with bigger grids, even in normal mode.<br /><br />I know the DS Picross game has a puzzle editor that can check if a puzzle has a unique solution or not, so you might want to look into that.<br /><br />Anyway the random mode is a very nice idea, it's really fun, beating records makes you make mistakes, nice!<br /><br />I guess the only thing I would add is a way to enter a name or initials at some point to claim bragging rights for records.
