<br />You must have the extremely rare version of the cart with the word "caution" underlined on the back.  Only SEVEN are known to exist in the wild!  Here's some advice:  hold on to it, get it appraised, and don't sell it until you can get AT LEAST 5000 thousand.  AT LEAST.  Don't walk out on a lime on this one!

It was done with a "perfect run" password from the "Metroid Password Generator": Start in Tourian, all items collected and even Mother Brain defeated (yes, it's possible to choose that in the Password Generator, so you can just pass and don't have to fight her), but the clock still at 0 seconds when starting to play. (So, it's a password that you could never get during normal gameplay.) And then go straight through Tourian and don't lose any unnecessary time. And bam: Nude Samus. Probably a little gag by the programmers since they knew that no-one would ever find it out. Well, they didn't think of emulators.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">blargg wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">A mod should change the original message to read that he found secret worlds in Metroid (the ones that have been known about for ages), along with screenshots showing these "new" discoveries.</div><br />I never claimed to have found a new world. Except of course, if with "new world" you refer to Samus' vajayjay.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">tepples wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">At least JohnJohn's nudity fixation has become NES-related this time.

<br />What good reason do you want? I went through the game (well, the last level) and got this ending. Since I've never heard of that ending, I posted it here.
<br />
<br />P.S.: Did you note that, although the game was made in the 80s where women were rather bushy, they already foresaw today's trend of women shaving "down there". I mean, the foundation of the Galactic Federation takes place in 2000 and "Metroid" takes place in 20X5. So, if 20X5 is 2005 or 2015 or if this trend doesn't change in the next decades, they did a really good job with their prediction.
