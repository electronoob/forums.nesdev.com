Because the NES inserts an<br />extra pixel every other frame, this forces the burst to have 1 of 2 different<br />phasings.&nbsp; This is clearly seen on the scope.<br /><br />As for the actual rendered video, there are only 8 different voltage levels.<br />The two grey sets, 00h and 0dh, conveniently output 4 of each voltage level. <br />This made testing rather simple.&nbsp; First, I output colours 00h, 10h, 20h, <br />and 30h, and then colours 0dh, 1dh, 2dh, and 3dh.&nbsp; The voltage levels of both <br />were measured.<br /><br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Approximate relative amplitudes, somewhat.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />The video output itself is somewhat interesting; The two voltages each<br />colour luminance value oscillates between are the same as the static<br />greys, as discussed above.&nbsp; For example, colour 15h is oscillating<br />between colour 1dh and 10h at a 3.579MHz rate.&nbsp; The phase of this <br />relative to the phase of the colourburst determines the colour seen.<br /><br />Interestingly, the saturation varies among the luminance values- the middle <br />two luma values &#40;1 and 2&#41; have the same saturation, but 0 and 3 are <br />&quot;squashed&quot;.&nbsp; Luminance 0 actually dips below the black level a tad, and <br />this is the cause of the issues if you use colour 0dh.&nbsp; This &quot;blacker than <br />black&quot; really isn't THAT far below the black level, and it really is a long <br />ways from synch.&nbsp; So, on most TVs, this shouldn't be too much of an issue <br />if you use colour 0dh for your black.<br /><br />Luminance 2 and 3 both have the same upper voltage, which explains why<br />colours 20h and 30h give the same colour; bright white.&nbsp; Incidentally, this<br />is the brightest colour the NES can produce, yielding the highest voltage.<br /><br /><br />Now for the data.&nbsp; All voltage levels are indicated two ways:&nbsp; absolute <br />and relative.&nbsp; The absolute voltage is just that- the voltage above <br />ground.&nbsp; The relative voltage is based off of the synch level.&nbsp; No part <br />of the waveform has a voltage lower than synch.&nbsp; Refer to the above two<br />diagrams for the points measured.<br /><br /><br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; |&nbsp; &nbsp; Normal&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;|&nbsp; &nbsp;Emphasis&nbsp; &nbsp;

&nbsp; ----+-------+-------+-------+-------+<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; * these two are the same voltage level<br /><br /><br />For the &quot;emphasis&quot; values, I turned all 3 emphasis bits on at once and then<br />recorded the requisite voltages.&nbsp; As was noted elsewhere, the emphasis bits<br />really are attenuation bits.&nbsp; Turning 1 or more bits on always results in a<br />REDUCTION of output level, either modulated with the colour carrier&#40;s&#41;, or<br />in the case of all bits on at once, a static value.&nbsp; As one would guess,<br />the emphasis values do not affect colour burst, synch, or black level.&nbsp; <br /><br />In all cases, the ratio of normal to emphasis is from 1.33 to 1.35, most of<br />the error probably being in measurement.&nbsp; So, flipping it around and making<br />it a percentage, turning on all of the bits will reduce the brightness by<br />74% to 75%.<br /><br /></div>

<br />What voltages were produced by colors xE/xF? Just the black level? If so, that would also agree with previous information, both voltage-wise and the fact that those colors aren't changed by emphasis - subtracting black level from each voltage and dividing by the maximum range (between $30 and black level), these voltages seem to match what's in the "NTSC Video" article over on the wiki.
<br />
<br />All in all, nice to have confirmation and clarification of the previous information gathered.

<br />
<br />Yeah, sorry I forgot to put that in.  Colours 0eh and 0fh produce the black level only.  No more, no less.  Both appear to behave identically (which is to be expected).
<br />
<br />I too was surprised that the emphasis stuff produced a straight 75% attenuation, almost exactly.  It could be that they run the voltage from the divider string(s) through another divider that chops off 25% when the transistor is turned on.  Regardless of how they do it internally, we now have 100% confirmation of what happens externally.

<br />It's what you'd expect if you used a reference point that was offset from zero. It's really nice to have the video levels scoped properly! I bet it didn't take that long to do with real tools either.
<br />
<br />How much is the signal changed from the PPU output pin to the RCA connector?

<br />
<br />It's two, two, two replies in one!
<br />
<br />As for the voltage level being high, yeah it's pretty darn high.  But this is OK, since this is directly on the emitter follower of the PPU.  This is going to be the cleanest place to monitor it, before it's passed through the modulator to the RF and video output jacks.  I was going to scope the video out jack with a 75 ohm load on it to see exactly what we're getting in terms of absolute amplitude.
<br />
<br />And yah, using a good scope made it pretty simple along with the test ROM.  Is there anything else anyone wants me to check on the video waveform while I have it set up?  I planned on getting some detailed timing analysis of it so that's already slated to occur.    But as for the video waveform itself, I think this might be all we need.

<br />
<br />Some other things to test:
<br />* As you mentioned, see how the signal is affected if you measure it on the RCA output <strong>with</strong> a 75 ohm load.
<br />* Verify the number of "pixels" in each portion of a scanline's signal:
<br />25 sync, 4 black, 15 colorburst, 5 black, 1 pulse, 15 left border (background color), 256 active, 11 right border (background color), 9 black
<br />* Verify that the phases of the individual emphasis channel waveforms ($2001 bit 7: same as color $x8, bit 6: color $x4, bit 5: color $xC
<br />* Verify that the color burst has the same phase as color $x8
<br />* When I was looking at the signal a while back, I noticed that just before the first pixel there as an extra pixel based I think on the background color. I think it might not have been the background color, just some modification of it.
<br />* Perhaps look at the waveform during blanking?

<br />
<br />Kevtris mentioned that on IRC, as well as the interesting fact that it was affected by color emphasis. Evidently, it's using color 00 for those 1 or 2 pixels.

<br />I measured the voltage coming out of my NES' video jack with a 75 ohm load resistor.  It measures 981mv peak to peak (synch to white).  That's pretty damn close to a perfect video level.
<br />
<br />The waveform is around 62mv above ground (synch tip).
