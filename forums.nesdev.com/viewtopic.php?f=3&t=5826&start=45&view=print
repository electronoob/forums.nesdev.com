<br />I looked at the html documentation of bass and it seems compatible except it does not use the bank system of WLA.
<br />Adapting to bass is possible it should be like replacing BANK directives or even create BANK macros. And rewrite two or three things. I hope it's standard 65816 instruction names and operands.
<br />
<br />What are the improvements in comparison to WLA?
<br />With WLA I must very often specify rep sep for 16/8 bit instructions. And it is not clear to me how we can specify that a chunk of code is 16 or 8 bit without using a rep/sep. I had many bugs because I expected 16bit instructions and got 8.

<br />P0P is no longer in the scene since around 1998, so he does not care about it...
<br />
<br />It is ROM only, but it still can be disassembled a bit to extract the main emulator parts...
<br />
<br />I belive Banks are simply like this in BASS for example:
<br />
<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">org $818000<br />db &quot;Code and Data Here&quot;<br /></div><br /><br />instead of WLA's extra functions:<br /><br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">;Is this right?<br />.BANK 1 SLOT 0<br />.org $8000<br />.db &quot;Code and Data Here&quot;<br /></div>
<br />
<br />BTW Overload actually had not created a NES emulator for SNES, But he created Super Sleuth... I think after the PM he said something about ''I still continue to work on this project, Byuu made a Misinterpretation''.

<br />
<br />It is also possible to run the Arkanoid version on  the nes and the snes and see what is different.
<br />But assembler without comments is awfull, especially the loops. I am interested in the interrupt vectors and they should be easy to read.
<br />
<br />I wait for other comments on this and if it is positive I will change the assembler to bass and release what I have on sourceforge.

<br />I haven't traced into Puzznic myself, but I seem to remember that one being opcode $89 when <a href="http://tasvideos.org/forum/viewtopic.php?p=306520#306520" class="postlink">they talked about it on tasvideos</a>. On the 65816, that has become BIT #$ii, which is very much like a 2-byte NOP except it modifies the N, V, and Z flags. So unless it does the 2-byte right before a branch, it should still work.

<br />Assemblers such as x816 (yes that's the name) have a pseudo-op called ".DETECT ON" which will automatically adjust the size of the assembled results based on current SEP/REP bits.  Per x816's documentation:
<br />
<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">.DETECT<br />Toggle bitlength detection. &#40;default is off&#41;<br />X816 is capable of automatically detecting the changes in<br />bitlengths.&nbsp; When enabled any use of forced bitlength<br />extensions or used of the REP/SEP instructions will change<br />the bit lengths for the accumulator and indexes within<br />the assembler.<br />Examples:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;.detect&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;; report detect on or off<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;.detect on&nbsp; ; enable autodetection<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;.detect off ; disable autodetection<br /></div>
<br />You can also use .MEM and .INDEX to force the size if you want, but .DETECT tends to do the Right Thing(tm).  Remember: it's an assembler, not an emulator, so it only traces SEP/REP sizing linearly.
<br />
<br />I've used x816 for quite some time to write both 65816 and 6502 (NES) code.  Since it's a 65816 assembler, when writing 6502 code I just have to remember (mentally) which opcodes aren't valid on the 6502.  One which often snags me is INC (implied), which was introduced on the 65c02.
<br />
<br />Anyway, maybe x816 can help make your life easier.  Of course, source for x816 isn't available, it's DOS-only (not even Win32), and Normal Yen (author) has been long gone from the "scene".  Version 1.12f is the latest.

<br />
<br />If a rom uses undocumented opcodes, it will trigger an error message. I do not think that many programs will use undocumented instructions. I think programs are much cleaner on Nintendo hardware than on C64.
<br />In SMB we have a branch on weird code but it is unused.

<br />
<br />I guess not...
<br />
<br />I will leave the user on thier own for mapper options then.
<br />
<br />To Byuu: Maybe I can ask if you can make banks possible via XML (the SNES 20-in-1 pirate is one, info availible @ d4s's site).
