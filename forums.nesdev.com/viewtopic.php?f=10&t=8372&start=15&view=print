<br />
<br />Yes, but when the character set, level data, etc needs to be larger than your RAM, then you're screwed - stopping to load isn't always an option.  So I still believe it's true, there are things you can do with a large ROM that are just not possible with smaller RAM.  For one example, I remember reading about a port of Mortal Kombat for Sega CD includes gameplay-ruining pauses so it can load data off the CD.  I just looked up info on it and apparently that was a problem on the Playstation and other versions also, whenever Shang Tsung morphed into other characters or even for some moves.  Yet the SNES port handles it all just fine, because the cart included enough memory.  So yeah, I'd say the SNES can sometimes have more memory than Playstation.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />The Down+B morphs of Sheik and Pokemon Trainer in Super Smash Bros. Brawl and opponent spawning during event matches take so long for the same reason. With more than two players, the action can't pause, so they load a character's textures and sound bank in the background. They could have gone with lower detail models and fit it all into the Wii's memory (64 MB RAM, 24 MB VRAM), as they did for the N64 version of Smash Bros. (16 MB ROM, 4 MB RAM), but players demanded more detail.
<br />
<br />A lot of Super NES games freeze while loading sound. Compare the level transitions between Super NES and Genesis in multiplatform titles like Zoop or Pinocchio. Trying to work around this by streaming stuff to the SPC all the time results in gameplay slowdowns, as seen in The Lord of the Rings.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Memory is also the reason why in the PCE Arcade Card CD version of World Heroes II, DIO cannot transform to every arbitrary character. If data are to be loaded from the CD during a match the result would be horrible. Not only that there'll be a (long) pause, the BGM will also be cut due to it being CD audio and drives bitd simply cannot play CD audio and access data from the disc at the same time (with rare exceptions such as the obsolete CD-Gs).
<br />
<br />Even the Neo Geo CD couldn't get away from this fate. Later AES/MVS games are so large that the RAM in the CD unit isn't enough to hold the stuff for a single level. A number of newer games have animations cut, such as the Metal Slug games (I think the PlayStation versions have annoying in-level loadings instead) and in the case of Art of Fighting 3, instead of sacrificing the animation frames, they shrunk all the sprites in the game.
<br />
<br />For cart games, I also remember the Mega Drive version of Strider Hiryu has some small pauses in-between levels. I think the game is possibly loading more level data to RAM and/or uploading more graphics data to VRAM (the PCE Arcade Card CD version isn't half as good in this case either).

<br />Then why didn't the games that streamed music from the CD use XA or other ADPCM audio, which could be ring-buffered? The Mega Man games for PS1 use this, as do Super Puzzle Fighter II Turbo and every PS1 version of DDR since 3rd Mix. Did the hardware not support ADPCM? Or were gamers of the time that insistent on playing the soundtrack in an ordinary CD player?

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Simple. As the 1st console in the world equipped with a CD-ROM XA simply wasn't available, also while it did have an ADPCM channel it's just a single mono channel and normally not meant to reproduce audio in high enough sample rate used for streamed music. Furthermore, the channel was already used in voices and data seeks on the 1X drive probably won't work well for "real-time streaming" events. Remember, the PCE was a console released in the late late 80's.
<br />
<br />Even for the PS1, a number of games (especially arcade conversions of fighting games) had animation cut to ensure smooth gameplay.
