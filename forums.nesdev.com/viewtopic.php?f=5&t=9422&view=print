You can build your portfolio from projects that you're released under free licenses or for free, and can get hired. Actually, you don't need to have any portfolio to get hired for first time, and you can build your portfolio that way, without any personal projects in it. It is very probably that you'll never be able to become a licensed console developer on your own, as a sole developer - so you have either to create a company/studio that develops software for modern platforms, and do a lot of prior non-console work, or get hired by such company.

Having a personal portfolio to show when you apply for jobs is going to help. But to your point, it is possible to get hired without any sort of credentials.

You can do it in a company, and in this case you don't need to be an indy developer in general, i.e. not the one who works on all aspects of a game all alone. Companies hire people with narrow specialization, to do things they saying the way they saying in the time they saying. So if your dream is to make your own 'proper', 'full size' game for a modern game console, you will have to get through years of boring, tedious work just to get chance to get a chance of it.

So what's the tactful way to express to the general public that there exists a nearly completed game of a smaller scope than a disc game that the general public cannot play because established publishers have failed to give information useful for improvement of the product in their rejection letters?<br /><br />EDIT: The most tactful way I can think of would be to put a trailer for the Windows PC based playable prototype on YouTube with &quot;we are seeking a publisher&quot; where the release date would be.

Are there well-accepted dos and don'ts for portfolios of candidates applying to video game companies, and if so, what are they? Is being a fan of first-person shooter and real-time strategy games, which as I understand it are the genres traditionally associated with PCs, necessary if one wants to become a professional developer even in some other genre?

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Well, the single most important thing you should do if you want to get hired is every day apply for several jobs you want, and repeat until you succeed (it may take several months).<br /><br />Tepples, in my opinion what you've already got on your website is a great portfolio if you want to be a game programmer. If you want to continue to create more and better game projects on your own, that's great, but I think you've already got more than enough to be interesting to a game company. If you started applying around I think you'd start getting called back for interviews fairly regularly.<br /><br />I got my first job (i.e. junior game programmer) after five months of applying everywhere I could think of. I had <a href="http://rainwarrior.ca/dragon/index.html" class="postlink">far less</a> to show at the time, but I had some solid computer graphics knowledge, and I could handle an interview well enough.<br /><br />Skilled programmers are actually pretty hard for any given company to find, especially one with skills relevant to any given specialty (e.g. games). Your existing work already demonstrates your competency at programming. What you'll have to demonstrate in an interview is that you're someone they can work together with. That's about it, I think.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />What rainwarrior and shiru said.<br /><br />You can of course apply to become an official developer for one of the major consoles (to be allowed to buy an SDK etc), and look for publishers that would be willing to publish your work. But unless you've got a few published titles under your belt already they'll most likely turn you down. To build that kind of experience your best bet would probably be to seek employment at a game development studio that works with one or more of the major consoles.<br /><br />If you want to develop your own game concepts you could put forward some of your ideas while working at a studio, which may or may not be successful depending on the size of the company, management attitudes, what types of games the company usually makes, etc. Or you could work for a few years at a studio to build experience, and then look into the possibility of starting your own company with some other people from the industry. Or you could take the route of self-publishing games (as download-only releases) for an open platform, like PC, iPhone or Android (ok iPhone isn't really an open platform, but anyone can create and release their own applications as long as the app isn't malicious/offensive/...).

Back when I was looking for a job I used to ask the companies if they'd pay for my travel expenses for those interviews that were in a different city (I did this when they got back to me to schedule the interview, not in my initial application). Only one company objected to this, and they changed their mind when I said I wouldn't go if I had to pay for the trip myself.<br />Perhaps they can hold a telephone interview with you if they're really far away, and fly you in for an additional interview if they still feel you're a good candidate.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">How does a platformer work on iOS or on an Android device that isn't an Xperia Play?

If you're going to develop a game for a touchscreen device, then maybe a platformer that requires spot-on control accuracy isn't the best idea.

Didn't stop minecraft multiplayer from becoming popular though.<br /><br />edit: and I think he was saying that whilst pc and phones are probably your best target platform, you're simply not gonna be able to make certain types of games. This is just a restriction due to the target platform.<br /><br />Don't ever expect to be able to make the games you really want to make, there's always gonna be compromises based on money and other such things.

And for some reason, people wonder why there's no innovation in video games.<br /><br />To reiterate one question that I asked above but which appears not to have been answered directly: Would a video of a playable prototype of a game in a not exactly PC- or phone-friendly genre ending with &quot;We are seeking a publisher&quot; be considered tactful or tactless?
