		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Hello,<br /><br />I was wondering... How did great composers like Koji Kondo and Jun Ishikawa composed the tracks for the old games??? Did they have trackers??? Did they have MIDI-converting programs??? But each sound engine was on it's own mood!!! Maybe these sound composers had to transcript their scores to raw sound engine data, obligating them having programming knowledge??<br /><br />The same for graphics... How did they do???

Maybe I will post some ideas, if someone like it. I don't know if people nowadays would use it, hence the low-priority attribute. I think the syntax of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_Macro_Language#Modern_MML_2" class="postlink">Modern MML</a> is good, only needs some fastful-to-write constructs, and additional features maybe related to sampling.<br /><br />What do you think???

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />People like to use MML because it is a well established standart, in use for like 30 years, and there are many compilers around. I don't think a new music language will get a real use, because there aren't too many MML users around these days.<br /><br />Speaking of making graphics on paper sheets, I did that too, in mid 90s. It is kind of fun, just not very productive.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I did that when I was just started to learn programming and game development, it was around 1994. I used ZX Spectrum, and as I didn't have any graphics software, I created graphics on paper sheets.<br /><br />As I know, in pro development paper sheets were used till ~1985 for production graphics, and later they were mostly used for things like planning screen layouts and locations.
