<br />Unlike the NES, the web browser is an evolving platform. Browser-specific APIs like this are often testbeds for APIs that will be put in the next version of HTML. So if your emulator supports both the Firefox and Chrome APIs, you're covered if either one gets accepted into the next version of HTML. So to continue the NES analogy, it's like making a game for a specific mapper.

<br />I'm not sure if I got the sarcasm/irony of your post, but I'm not using IE6, nor is Chrome open source as far as I know. On the other hand, Chrome is run by a company even more powerful than Microsoft. If you are against ultra-large-companies-sitting-on-their-monopoly you'd avoid Chrome even more then IE.
<br />
<br />Not that I am opposed against chrome, I haven't ever tried it. I was just not sure what you were talking about.

<br />Woah, totally awesome, can't wait for this update! <img src="./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /> Also, I think the MMC3 mapper code or CPU code will need fixing. VNES was never to emulate Crystalis correctly. I don't know if you've fixed/upgraded the CPU at all, but something is off there in it's inner workings.

<br />Woah, seems like you're on it. I think it was just nametables and IRQ being off. But I haven't played it all the way through on vNES, but it's probably fine.
