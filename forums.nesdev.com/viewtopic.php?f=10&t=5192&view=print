		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Okay, so I'm working on my platformer and I'm now needing to program physics. By that, I mean mainly gravity and jumping.
<br />
<br />To be honest, I don't know <em>that</em> much about physics. I mean, I can understand the obvious stuff, but when it comes to all of the formulas I'm not so certain. I'm just wondering what kind of information I'd need in order to program the pull of gravity or what kind of math needs to be done. What do some commercial games do in terms of gravity/jumping? I understand I'd need to incorporate velocity in somehow, but I'm not quite sure how. To be honest I'm not exactly sure in terms of physics what velocity specifically refers to! <img src="./images/smilies/icon_redface.gif" alt=":oops:" title="Embarassed" /> And I'm trying to stay away from LUTs as much as possible, as I feel math is always the best and most reliable way to do things. So does anyone have any suggestions? Any help is appreciated. Thanks in advance!

To simulate gravity you need to increase the (vertical) velocity by a constant amount each frame, and incrase the Y position by the vertical velocity amount each frame (this is mathematical integration). It's really easy to do and you don't need any lockup table, just a few additions. You'd want to work with signed numbers, though.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />The way I usually handle physics ends up working like <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4rENgv3Tps" class="postlink">this</a>. This is the demo (more of a proof of concept really, as it's very incomplete) of my graduation project for college. If you like how the physics feel, here is a bit of how it works:
<br />
<br />The object's velocity is added to the object's coordinates every frame. There is one velocity for X and another for Y. If left is pressed, a negative constant value is added to VelocityX. If right is pressed, a positive constant value is added to VelocityX. There should be maximum and minimum values for the velocity, so you should make sure it stays in that range, or the character will accelerate forever.
<br />
<br />If both directions are pressed, you should cancel them out or something (this is something we discussed before, so do whatever works best for you, at the physics level or at the controller-reading level). If no direction is pressed, you have to slow the object down (reducing the velocity by a constant value) in the opposite direction in which it's moving, paying attention to not let the velocity change signs (if it goes beyond 0 in either direction, set it to 0).
<br />
<br />Vertical velocity is usually modified by gravity, which is a constant positive value (of course you could make it variable and negate it on certain game events for a fancy ceiling walking feature, like seen in some games). It is also modified when jumping, as it's set to a negative value, which will keep the object moving up for a while until gravity pulls it back down.
<br />
<br />I check for collisions after movement in each direction, and correct the object's position if the movement got it inside a wall, floor or ceiling. It works in the following order: update the X coordinate, check for horizontal collisions, update the Y coordinate, check for vertical collisions. Sometimes collisions affect the state of the object. You may for example want to clear the velocity when it hits something.
<br />
<br />Now there are slopes. They make everything more complex, and there are a lot of things to decide before implementing them. some games will let the character stand on a slope, some won't, for example. Anyway, I just started to implement slopes to this game, and I do not remember if my method worked or not, but I added the concept of floor resistance, a property that each block had. It could be positive or negative, depending on the direction of the slope, or 0, if the block wasn't a slope. I guess I just added that resistance to the object's velocity, so that it would make it easier or harder to go down or up a slope. I believe I also allowed the velocity to go beyond 0 if the objects was on a slope, so it wasn't possible to stand still over them.
<br />
<br />Well, this is all I can think for now. I'm looking at the source code of the game and the physics related code isn't so big, so if you are interested in seeing it (it's in ActionScript, but should be pretty easy to understand even if you are not familiar with the language) I may post whatever is relevant here.

<br />It's <strong>look up</strong>, Bregalad. I'm sure you don't want to see his game locking up because he used a lockup table! =)
<br />
<br />Anyway, you are right. I was just reviewing my sources and all the physics are handled by a very small portion of code. And it's also true that you can do it all with additions/subtractions, I don't think I have used a single multiplication or division for the physics in that demo.

<br />While first programming a platforming game, this page helped me with jumping physics:
<br />
<br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://tasvideos.org/RockmanData.html">http://tasvideos.org/RockmanData.html</a><!-- m -->
<br />
<br />Basically, upon jumping, the vertical speed is set to something, and every frame, it goes down by some amount.
<br />
<br />Before reading that, I was trying to implement jumping with crazy things like sine waves and stuff <img src="./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":-P" title="Razz" />

<br />The first 16 bytes are subtracted from the sprite's Y coord (to make the character "fall up"). The next 16 are added back into the Y coord to make him come back down.
<br />
<br />This gives me a few benefits,

<br />1.) Takes math off the CPU.

<br />3.) Much easier to go back and make quick changes. I found at one point i wanted to increase the jump height by 40%. Took me 30 seconds to make the change.

A few tests should be enough to get the exact values, but I bet you'd have to test forever to make a good 32-byte table. And you are also stuck to that same height, and can't use different impulses for variable-height jumps, unless you have a bunch of tables. And the logic itself is not hard at all.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">3.) Much easier to go back and make quick changes.

If by any chance you decide that the animation needs more than 32 frames you even have to change the size of the table, and thus the code that reads it.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">4.)

But still, even if you can quickly pick the highest point of the jump, finding decent values for all the other elements of the table might take a while.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">I guess the downside is that it's not as realistic</div>
<br />It can look pretty realistic, as long as you pick (or calculate) the values for the table. For me, the downside is how difficult it can be to make the right table, and the how hardcoded the whole thing is, meaning you can't have tons of different jumps in the game (for different characters, or depending on how long the jump button is pressed).
<br />
<br />Plus, you can't make a table for gravity because you can fall from all sorts of heights, and since falling is half of the jumping sequence, why not make the first half dynamic as well? I just feel that real time calculations result in a much better experience, and is actually not harder to implement than tables.
<br />
<br />EDIT: Heh, I was a bit late, tepples answered first. But I see that him and I agree in many points.

<br />
<br />At the end of the lookup table, you hit terminal velocity and stop accelerating. In reality with 16 values in the LUT, i'm not sure you have enough screen to really fall that far. I'd have to do the calculations. I know in my game you can't fall far enough to max it out.
<br />
<br />Again, my game doesn't have moving platforms either (it's not a platformer), but if i were to implement it i would probably cheat. I would set the character's sprite high enough to clear the moving platform, then complete the jump as usual. The acceleration wouldn't be affected by the platform's movement.
<br />
<br />For different characters jumping, it's simple. Before i jump, i set a flag telling the jump routine which lookup table to use.
<br />
<br />Lookup tables aren't the best solution for many situations, but it fits my game perfectly. I'm not sure i'd go that route with a platformer, i guess it would depend on how i setup the physics. In my game, there are so few instances where the player would want to jump, it's not worth writing a better physics routine.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Hey, thanks for the replies guys.
<br />
<br />I didn't think a linear increase of velocity would suffice for gravity, but it actually works quite nicely. I was thinking at first of multiplying velocity by like 1.1 or something every frame, but just adding around 24/256 to the velocity every frame gives me more freedom and takes less CPU time.
<br />
<br />So I've taken some advice from what I've read and there each object will be "displaced" based on it's velocity. Of course, velocity is signed and has more precision than just integer values (for example, velocity can be 1.235 instead of just 1 or 2). So if an object has no velocity, it won't move. If it has velocity, it does move. Simple as that.
<br />
<br />So tell me if this sounds adequate, I'm pretty sure this will work out nicely. When an object is airborne (not in water or anything), 24/256 will be added to the velocity every frame. When the jump button is pressed (only if the player is on solid ground or has permission to jump) the velocity will be set to -3 or something like that. Then gravity will take its toll and add 24/256 to that every frame, thus meaning the player is being moved vertically at a decreasing rate. Then eventually that value will cross 0, and the player will come back down.
<br />
<br />Then I don't want the player to not have control on how high they jump, so I think I can do the following to implement some control on how high they jump:
<br />
<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">If Player.Jumping = True Then<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;If Player.VelocityY &lt; 0 Then<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;If Controller.JumpButton = NotPressed Then<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Player.VelocityY = 0<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Player.Jumping = False<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;End If<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;End If<br />End If<br /></div>
<br />
<br />Basically if the player is jumping, still moving up, and the jump button is released, the velocity will be set to 0, and the rest of the code will be told that the player is not jumping as they are now just falling. Does that sound good enough?
<br />
<br />Oh, and tokumaru, I do my collision detection the same way you were talking about. Because an object might move in two directions at once, you can never be sure in which direction there was a collision, because you only know that a point "exists" inside of a tile; you don't know that it moved in horizontally or vertically.

So I guess that a better alternative would be to allow the player to keep increasing (or decreasing, since negative values move objects up) the velocity some frames after the jump started if the button remains pressed. that way, a quick tap will result in the just basic boost being applied, but holding the button longer will prevent gravity from working so soon, causing the character to go higher.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">Oh, and tokumaru, I do my collision detection the same way you were talking about.

<br />Yeah, but even this way is just a crude approximation, as the correct thing would be to actually trace a line between the 2 points and check the position after every pixel moved. Look at the following:

<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;/<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;P<br /><br />------+<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; |<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; |</div><br />Say that "P" is the player, falling diagonally as indicated by the slash. Depending on which direction you move it and check for collisions first (X or Y), it may or may not land on that ledge.<br /><br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;P<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;|<br />------+&nbsp; |<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; |&nbsp; *<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; |</div><br />If you move it vertically first, it'll end where the "*" is, and when you move it horizontally it'll hit the wall.<br /><br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">&nbsp; &nbsp; *----P<br /><br />------+<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; |<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; |</div>
<br />But if you move it horizontally first, the player will be positioned over the floor, and when it's moved vertically it will land on the floor. Which one is the correct behavior? I'll only know if you trace a straight line, which would be too slow to do on the NES.
<br />
<br />Anyway, we have to pick one to do first (I think I handle X first) and hope it will all turn out OK. I believe most games work like this and nobody complains, so it's probably OK.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Yeah, I'm still experimenting with different values. It's important to find the right one because a jump mechanic is REALLY important to be dead on in a platformer.
<br />
<br /><div class="quotetitle">tokumaru wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"><div class="quotetitle">Celius wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">Basically if the player is jumping, still moving up, and the jump button is released, the velocity will be set to 0, and the rest of the code will be told that the player is not jumping as they are now just falling. Does that sound good enough?</div><br /><br />Hum... that is not how jump control usually works. The height is usually defined by how long you keep the button pressed at the start of the jump. So I guess that a better alternative would be to allow the player to keep increasing (or decreasing, since negative values move objects up) the velocity some frames after the jump started if the button remains pressed. that way, a quick tap will result in the just basic boost being applied, but holding the button longer will prevent gravity from working so soon, causing the character to go higher.</div>
<br />
<br />Sorry, I kind of meant what you said. My jump mechanic allows the player to go higher the longer the jump button is held from the start of the jump. I meant that while the player is jumping (moving up), if the jump button goes <em>from</em> a held state <em>to</em> a released state, then the velocity will be set to 0 so that the player immediately starts falling (gravity will add to the velocity every frame, so if you set it to 0, the player will stop moving up, and gravity will start taking its toll).
<br />
<br />And about the collision stuff; I never thought about that kind of case! I think it's probably better to do X first, like you said, otherwise the player will get pissed from not making a jump and colliding horizontally with the edge or something like that. Though it's really not a big deal. And besides, the player probably won't be able to understand how the mechanics work just by looking at the game, as they can't see the player move horizontally, then vertically (unless the game is programmed REALLY bad), so they most likely won't complain about that.
<br />
<br />This kind of thing actually is really more important in sprite-on-sprite collision. What you were talking about with checking each pixel on the line of movement would have to be done too in order to actually know that two objects collide. Say two 4x4 pixel spheres are moving at each other 8 pixels per frame. They have the same Y coords, and are moving at each other horizontally. So one on the right is moving left, and the one on the left is moving right. At one point, Sphere 1's X coordinate is 140, and Sphere 2's X coordinate is 146. Their bounding boxes do not overlap. But then, Sphere 2 moves 8 pixels left, and Sphere 1 moves 8 pixels right, so now Sphere1.X = 148, and Sphere2.X = 138. They clearly would have collided, but if you check for bounding box overlap, the two objects would read to not have collided. They instead passed through each other!
<br />
<br />I still have to find a good way to prevent this. For now I don't have to worry about it so much, as I don't have things moving very fast, and things aren't really smaller in width or height than their speed per frame. Plus I might have a 2x2 pixel bullet going pretty fast, but a 16x32 pixel object checks for collision against it, so the two objects won't pass through each other. Have you found a solution to this sort of problem? Or is it like the corner issue with sprite on BG?

<br />For collisions I guess I just avoid making collision boxes too small. If they are never smaller than the maximum displacement for objects, you're not likely to miss a hit unless both objects are moving at the maximum speed, but how often does that happen? I think that even if your bullets are very small, their collision boxes should be slightly larger than the sprite itself.

Why would you be decreasing the velocity? Perhaps I'm executing the idea of velocity differently, or I'm just not seeing something. But I do agree that I should probably not immediately let the character drop, but let the character stay in air for a little while. Basically here's what happens. Every frame, this happens:<br /><br />Player.YCoord = Player.YCoord + Player.VelocityY<br /><br />And also every frame, gravity does this:<br /><br />#DEFINE Gravity 0.14<br /><br />Player.VelocityY = Player.VelocityY + Gravity<br /><br />That happens every single frame. It's okay to do this even when standing on the ground, because when any of the player's bounding box borders collide with a solid tile, the velocity for the corresponding axis is set to 0. So if the top or bottom border of the player's bounding box collides with a solid tile, Player.VelocityY is set to equal 0. If the left or right border collides with something solid, Player.VelocityX is set to equal 0. So if the player is just standing still on a solid tile, the gravity routine will just add .14 (or something similar) to the Y Velocity, that will get added to the Y coordinate, and the player will be pulled down into the solid tile the player is standing on, which then they will get pushed out of and the Velocity Y will be set again to 0. Well, that whole bit is rather unimportant, I guess.<br /><br />However, when the player jumps, assuming the player is allowed to jump, here's what I do:<br /><br />Player.VelocityY = -2.5<br /><br />I initialize the VelocityY with a value of -2.5, and the gravity adds .14 to that value every frame. Since VelocityY gets added to PlayerY every frame, that means -2.5 gets added one frame, -2.36 gets added the next, -2.22 the next, -2.08, etc. So the velocity is constantly increasing from gravity's pull, which means it's decreasing the Y coordinate by less and less each frame, thus slowing to the peak of the jump. However, if the player lets go of the jump button, I'll just zero out Player.VelocityY to make the player start falling again (though like I said, I'm reconsidering now that you mention it). And actually, the player does remain suspended in the air for a little while even as is, as it takes a moment for the gravity to accelerate. I didn't really notice anything too bad with this mechanic, but it could be improved if I didn't make the player immediately start falling. I could instead of making the value 0 when the button is released just make it something like -.7 so that there's still a little more rising time after the button is released.<br /><br />Sorry if this isn't making any sense, or if I just explained the obvious, or if the above is just a bunch of crap text for any reason at all =).<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">tokumaru wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">But you are right, it's not such a big deal.

<br />
<br />I guess there does come a point where it's just not going to be good/accurate enough, and you have to give in and say "well then that's too damn bad". And it's not a big deal. the most annoying thing about old school games definitely isn't bad collision detection (that's more of an early PS1 3D problem). Nothing gets on my nerves more than enemies CONSTANTLY respawning (It makes me want to kill someone when some dumbass enemy keeps walking on screen even though I've killed it 1000 times =).)
<br />
<br />And I suppose it goes the same way for sprite-on-sprite. Just hope for the best, like you said. But it's important to still recognize these problems/glitches, as one day you could realize that they are the reason your program isn't working the way you expected.
