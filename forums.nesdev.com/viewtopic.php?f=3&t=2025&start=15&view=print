Are those games even compatible with older emulators, or do their ROM files contain duplicated data to fill the necessary 16KB?
<br />
<br />I think board names stored in text format are useless, especialy when we have only 8 bytes left to implement new stuff. Codes would be just fine.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I've to mostly agree with Dish.
<br />Also, there is a infinite number of boards, and noone can come with a complete finished, official list. I think text boards name in the header isn't a good idea. It it would to be, only the second letter would care anyway. The first letter just is an alternate way to tell the mapper number, the second letter will tell the variant of board of that mapper and all this is just followed by "ROM" on normal cards, and "EPROM" on prototypes allowing the layout for standarded pinout EPROMs. So only the second letter would really have meaningfull information, but as long as PRG/CHR size is already mentionned and SRAM size have to be mentionned, the battery bit is also here to know if the RAM is backed up or not. Definitely, there is nothing we have to do with board names in the file.
<br />Merge SRAM file and ROM file is a bad idea overall. You cannot copy/paste your SAV files to keep an infinite amount of game saves, wich isn't cool. Also, you cannot submit SAV files without submitting the whole ROM, and this kills any backward compability.
<br />I think the second mapper nybble that tells only the high 8-bits of the mapper number still have another free nyble in the same byte. Something like this would be welcome in this byte :
<br />bit 0-1 -&gt; SRAM Size : 0-&gt; NO SRAM; 1-&gt; 8kByte 2-&gt; 2x8kByte, 3-&gt; 32kByte
<br />bit 2 -&gt; iNES version number : 0-&gt; old iNES; 1-new iNES (notice : If old iNES, I think 8kb SRAM has to be assumed even if not specified)
<br />bit 3 -&gt; Someone else's parameter would come here
<br />bit 4-5 -&gt; High 8 bits of mapper number
<br />
<br />EDIT :
<br />Again, I'm against ANY image in the ROM, that's stupid. Buy the game or search the net if you want any.
<br />Game Name is already specified in the file name of the ROM. I'd just go with the country and revision, that would fit one more bye I think.

<br />Certainly a valid opinion, but why not give the option?  If the header is flexible enough, it shouldn't matter whether the image is there or not (nor require space if it isn't), but for those who want it (or any other info), the option is there.

<br />What are you trying to do here people? Saving images along with the game? This is just crazy if you ask me. The goal of an emulator is to accurately execute a program, as the real platform would. Anything more than that is beside the point. I see no need to boost the size of ROM files way up just so you can see the box cover everytime you play the thing.
<br />
<br />NES games are often so small that their size is comparable to that of JPEG images. If having the cover of a game means doubling the download size, no thanks. And it's not like you need that kind of stuff all the time. If you like pictures, build you own collection aside from the ROM collection.
<br />
<br />Anything that is not pertinent to the execution of the program should not be contained in the ROM file (the PROGRAM!).
<br />
<br />The goal here is to keep old games alive, and not to pirate them to the smaller possible detail.
<br />
<br />Anyway, that is only my opinion. It's not like I'm the owner of all truth.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Well, maybe to put this in perspective, I'm thinking about my DVD collection.  All of my DVDs are in a box in the basement.  The content, along with cover art, actor info, studio info, etc. is saved on a computer and played from there (think of each DVD directory as a rom file).  My DVD player (i.e., emulator) reads all of the DVD info and I can view cover art, sort by release date, director, etc.  I own the DVD (not pirated), but I still appreciate having all of the details easily accessible.
<br />
<br />Now, this could all be stored in a separate database, but why not keep it with the game itself in a single file?  Seems less complicated.
<br />
<br />With the ubiquity of broadband and giant hard drives, additional file size should not be an issue.  Although, again, if the header is flexible enough, feel free to strip out anything you don't want without worry.

<br />the checksum is kinda pointless i think.  i would use it to verify a rom but use a known checksum that wasnt in the file.
<br />
<br />seems like this thread is going to be long....  perhaps we should figure our options.
<br />
<br />first figure out if we want to fix ines, fix unif, or come up with a new format.
<br />
<br />i vote to come up with a new format.
<br />[edit] new format similiar to unif or fix unif
<br />
<br />also, after this is decided, perhaps start the discussion of a standard save state?  my emulator is not done and doenst have any save state yet (nothing worth saving anyway).  has anyone tried the format proposed suggested awhile ago?  the save state format might need a new thread!

<br />
<br />I know that they can still be hacked! But it just makes it more difficult.
<br />
<br />However, despite your anti-new file format views, you have made some excellent points. I am very interested in having a bit/byte that selects 50hz/60hz or maybe a region code.
<br />
<br />As for having the SRAM in the ROM. I stand by it. If you want to copy it out, then just use a hex editor. As for "your favourite (old) emulator not being compatible", tough! Why are you using such an old emulator? Use one of the new ones that becomes compatible, or download the source and modify it.
<br />
<br />Here is a thought for the info byte;
<br />
<br />1. Horizontal/Vertical Mirroring
<br />2. SRAM
<br />3. Trainer (WTF is a trainer anyway???)
<br />4. 4 Screen VRAM
<br />5. 1 Screen Mirroring
<br />6. 50hz/60hz Select
