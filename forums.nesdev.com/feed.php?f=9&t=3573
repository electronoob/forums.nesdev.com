This may be considered threat hijacking, but I think it's along the same lines, so please excuse me.<br /><br />So I was thinking about making a nrom multicart by having a switch on each oe. I was going to have 3 or 4 games on it. <br /><br />I've made a SNES reproduction using these instructions and it works great:<br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.romlab.prv.pl/">http://www.romlab.prv.pl/</a><!-- m --><br /><br />That just switches the oe on the eproms, so I thought I would just do that for the multicart.  I had planned to use original roms, but I then realized that PRG roms don't seem to have oe.<br /><br />From what Kevtris says, I'll also have to have a switch on the PRG a14 and ce and the CHR side oe and ce.  Am I missing something or is this correct? What's the a14 switch for?<br /><br />I think from what was said here, the oe only switch would only work because eproms are different than roms?<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=231">sevast</a> — Thu Sep 20, 2007 5:26 pm</p><hr />

BTW, Atari is NOT known for being overly complicated-  their hardware is as bare bones as they could get away with.  If you're thinking about those "useless" caps on the joystick inputs that Heckendorn says are not needed... well, try saying that to the FCC.<br /><br />They serve two purposes:  1)  they remove interference radiated by the joystick cables (since they basically are antennas due to the long length of wire).   and 2) they add some protection to the inputs so that static electricity won't blow out the port chip if you plug/unplug controllers.  <br /><br /><br />And no, the method I explained in detail IS the simplest way to achieve the desired goal.  You have to switch  5 signals per cart:<br /><br />A14, /CE, and IRQ for the CPU....  and CIRAM A10 and /RD for the CHR.<br /><br />The reason is you want the carts to see addresses 0000-3FFF when they are supposed to be "off", and IRQs have to be multiplexed 'cause they are outputs and are not open collector or anything.<br /><br />On the CHR side, pulling /RD high will totally disable everything on the CHR side, and CIRAM A10 is needed for mirroring feedback.  <br /><br />This IS THE SIMPLEST WAY to do it.<br /><br />If you wish to use more than 5 or so carts, you MUST BUFFER THE SIGNALS to preserve their integrity if you want it to work at all.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"><br />By the time he mentioned that the chips were CMOS I had already started the project and had not mentioned the forums since then - When I DID check the forums halfway though the day, I learned this - talked it over with my partner and looked somethings up, and agreed that on top of a few other problems we had not figured out yet, it was entirely possible that the carts could draw power even though the ground and acc were not hooked up.<br /></div><br /><br />You need to stop listening to your friend that doesn't seem to know a whole lot about electronics.

Also if you are serious about electronics, it's a good idea to collect discarded equipment.  Answering machines, 386 computers, etc. so you can pull (free) parts.

Huh.  Well, i'm afraid i don't really have any pictures, because we only got so far.<br /><br />Until today, I didn't know about the CMOS situation, and after talking it over with Mike (who knows a fair deal more about electrnoics than I) we decided that model wouldent work out, and even if the cmos didn't draw current, feeding signal and current to inactive boards would be a dumb idea anyway.  <br />Not wanting the day to be a waste, we spent some time going over other ideas that WOULD work, and the only one we could think of was my horrible original idea - a switch that switched every wire from one cartridge to another - or a switch that re-directed 72 wires!<br />That's a terrible idea, and it's far more complicated then I reall felt like doing - Also, it would cost more than I can afford, and I can't afford much.<br />We talked over what I COULD afford and we looked at what I had.<br />We had the connectors, now cut off and ready to be doubled up on catridges, still attached to ribbon cable.<br />Maybe, JUST MAYBE if we had a connector for ribbon cabels, and we set it up right, we could "switch" cartridges by switching which ribbon cabel went where with IDE connectors. It wasen't a great idea - but the parts store was just down the street and double male connectors are only a dollar - so we went and picked up two.<br /><br />We wound up with this:<br /><img src="http://img.waffleimages.com/ea2234fe6da415e57b65c040c699d9dbd8f69694/Picture%20160.jpg" alt="Image" /><br /><br />That's a Universal ribbon cabel with a modified 5.25 connector.  We figured we would use two 5.25 for the main board in place of the standard 72 pin - connect the ribbons to another set of ribbons going to another set of 5.25s on the cart.  Not the greatest idea, but I was out of money and we just wanted to see SOMETHING for our work, and if a makeshift cardridge slot extender that could be switched with ANOTHER of the same was all we could manage that day, then that was it.<br /><br />We tried it, and we got a white blinking screen.  To test it, I put the standard 72 back on, and got the same result.  In fact I coudlent get any cart to work at all in the systems sandard set up.<br /><br />"I thought you said your NES worked?" I asked him<br />"Oh, that one is still in Daivs.   I thought the connector was just a little dusty."<br />Great. Wrong nes.<br /><br />So I flipped it over and disabeled the 10Nes, perked up the bottom row of the pins on the 72 - and now it works better than mine.<br /><br />By this time it was 930, and we were done for the day.<br /><br />So long story short, information I found out today pretty much spelled doom for the project, but we tried anyway.  I built some interesting parts, but we failed to determine if they would do the job due to other complications.  We DID use a voltemeter to proove that they could move current fine, but no practical test was successfuly performed.  <br />In the end, I re-learned some electronic prinicpals i'd long since forgotten, and I built some connectors that I can still use for SD card projects, and a NES on a chip portable project I might do in the near future. If I have some time during the week, I might test out the terrible connector switch thing we built today on my NES, but my hopes are pretty dim for it.  Still, I had fun.<br /><br /><br />Oh! In return for fixing his NES and entertaining him all day, mike gave me his old NES Advantage Joystick that he's not using anymore! THis thing is great, I used to have one when I was a little kid, but it felt too bug for me to use! It took up my whole LAP! Now it's just about the right size, and it feels great! <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">p2 wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"><br />]... you wanted to save a few bucks and were too much in a hurry.<br /></div><br />Just to clear something up here - It's not that I want to "save a few bucks," it's that I only HAVE a few bucks.  I work part-time at a local comic shop. I make about 200-250 a month, and most of it goes to Gas and school.  If I COULD spend more on projects I really would, trust me - but as is, I have to entertain myself with what I have - and it entertains me to see how much I can do with very little.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">p2 wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"><br />don't know what the fuck you're doing and have the impression that you can totally ignore important aspects of electronics without too much problems.<br /></div>  Please don't uneccissarily curse. It's annoying and it makes you sound like an asshole.<br />Also, ignorance of electronics is far different than ignoring the principals of it.  I've admitted pretty freely here that I am pretty amature, and I enjoy learning though trial and error.  <br />In the future, if you want to help, please explain things or point those who need help in the right direction. It would also be nice if you did in a polite manner, rather than acted annoyed that others know less than you and are excited about learning more.  Perhaps you weren't acting this way, but it's how your writing came accross, at least.  <br />I had fun doing this, even though I fell quite short of my origional goal. Please dont ruin that fun, it was the process I enjoyed, and I accepted at the start that failure is part of that process.  <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />....<br /><br />Thanks to everybody that helped, i'm going to peek around and see what other projects there are, and see what else is in my range.  If nothing else (aside from parts and experience) this project got me to disable my first 10nes, which showed GREAT results.  I'm going to look through the documentaiton and see what I think i'm capable of now, and do reading for what I think I might be capable of in the future.<br /><br />Also, double thanks to Atari, for being polite, helpful, and encouraging.  You're alright in my book.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3397">seaniccus</a> — Sat Sep 15, 2007 11:27 pm</p><hr />

I would recommend building some simple circuits involving PRG/CHR ROMs (like a basic EPROM cart), and get the feel for how things work first.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=45">drk421</a> — Sat Sep 15, 2007 7:59 pm</p><hr />

I would also like to point out that, based on my experience, doing things the good way on the first try is better than making several non-working revisions just because you wanted to save a few bucks and were too much in a hurry.<br /><br />You'll actually end up spending more if you don't know what the fuck you're doing and have the impression that you can totally ignore important aspects of electronics without too much problems.<br /><br />In short: leave the hackendorns and join those who aren't totally clueless, because you won't go far without doing some wikipedia reading.<br /><br />Note that I'm merely just trying to help by pointing out the blatant reality.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=1645">p2</a> — Sat Sep 15, 2007 3:49 pm</p><hr />

The chips, when unpowered, are gonna load the bus down and probably corrupt the data on it.<br /><br />This is also why long floppy cables don't work very well.  The high frequency and long lines = capacitive coupling (and to a lesser extent inductance) which makes the signals look more like a sawblade than a squarewave.   As a result, shit don't work right, or it will be flaky, if it does anything.<br /><br />So as we keep saying:<br /><br />a) bigger power supply<br />b) buffer groups of carts individually<br />c) don't use more than a few inches of ribbon cable<br />d) do not switch power/ground on the carts<br />e) DO switch A14, /CE, IRQ on the CPU side and A13/CIRAM A10/RD on the CHR side<br />f) DO get proper connectors<br />g) read up about how logic circuits work<br /><br />failure to do these things will result in it not working (or if it does work by chance, it will be flaky and unreliable)<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=230">kevtris</a> — Sat Sep 15, 2007 3:12 pm</p><hr />
