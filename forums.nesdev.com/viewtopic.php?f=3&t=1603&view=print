		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />i just want to know if there are better methods to implement ddraw interface to the emu. I have a secondary buffer on on board graphics card mem (of course). i mean having it in PC memory is a pain in the performance.
<br />Im using 32 bit per pixel and i have a func like : DDPutPixel(DWORD x, DWORD y, DWORD Color)
<br />
<br />What im currently doing is:
<br />
<br />1- Lock the surface
<br />3 - I put the pixels while NES is rendering pixels (sl 0 - 239)
<br />4 - Then i unlock and blt the surface to the primary -&gt; go back to 1
<br />
<br />One thing to mention is that as screen witdh in NES is 256 this "DDPutPixel()" makes a:
<br />
<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">DDPutPixel&#40;DWORD x, DOWRD y, DWORD Color&#41;<br />&#123;<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;*&#40;&#40;LPDWORD&#41;lpSurfacePtr + &#40;Y &lt;&lt; 8&#41; + X&#41; = Color;<br /><br />&#125;<br /></div>
<br />
<br />In other words: &lt;&lt; 8 to avoid multiplication. That's the only thing i can optimize  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" alt=":(" title="Sad" /> .
<br />
<br />Anyone having a ddraw implementation different from that?

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />This response isn't specific to emulation, since I haven't written an emulator.  Anyway.. A putpixel routine is a nice thing to have if you're learning graphics programming and you want to play around with it.. but it's basically never efficient in practice.  When you've got to redraw the whole surface using elements as small as pixels, it's generally better to begin at a known location (usually the beginning -- 0) and step forward as you write through the whole surface.  You're going to write every pixel anyway.  View the surface as a 1-dimensional memory buffer, and write numbers into the current location as you step to get the colors you want.  When it gets to the end of the row, the next address begins on the next row.. so the vertical step occurs naturally.  Sometimes this can even allow you to gain extra efficiency by writing more than one pixel in a single write.  So.. Do it this way, and you don't need to keep recalculating your position from x and y.
<br />
<br />Sometimes your position is implicit in the way you write the routine.. or sometimes you have a variable for the pointer to the current memory address.. or sometimes it's a combination of each.  Whatever you do, avoid unnecessary calculations.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Your code is flawed in that you assume the pitch of the surface to be even with the width -- which is often not the case.
<br />
<br />For plotting individual pixels like that, multiplication is UNAVOIDABLE.  However individual pixels plotting (and thus, multiplication) can be avoided.  Note to plot a pixel, the correct way to do it is:
<br />
<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">void* out = &#40;&#40;BYTE*&#41;surface_pointer&#41; + &#40;Y * surface_pitch&#41; + &#40;X * bytes_per_pixel&#41;;<br /><br />*&#40;&#40;DWORD*&#41;out&#41; = pixel;&nbsp; // assuming 32-bit<br /></div><br /><br />Note that the surface width is used <em>nowhere</em> in the calculations.  You MUST use the pitch to determine where each scanline starts.  There's no way around it.  Failure to do so will cause terrible effects for many people -- if it's working now, it's just a coincidence.<br /><br /><br />Anyway -- for something like an NES emulator where the entire surface can be written to in "like-a-book" type fashion -- you don't need this kind of pixel plotting, you can just adjust the surface pointer as you render pixels (as augnober suggested in his post):<br /><br />vars to keep:<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">BYTE* video_out;&nbsp; &nbsp;// output pointer<br />int&nbsp; vid_pitch_add;&nbsp; // number of bytes of padding between end of one scanline and start of the next<br /></div><br /><br />When frame starts (assumes you will always render 256 pixels for every scanline):<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">video_out = ddraw_surface_pointer;<br />vid_pitch_add = surface_pitch - &#40;256 * bytes_per_pixel&#41;;<br /></div><br /><br />When you render a pixel (assuming 32-bit):<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">*&#40;&#40;DWORD*&#41;video_out&#41; = pixel;<br />video_out += 4;&nbsp; // move pointer to point to next pixel<br /></div><br /><br />At the end of a scanline:<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">video_out += vid_pitch_add;&nbsp; // skip over padding to start of next scanline<br /></div>

Check out how I do it in my emulator (look at the DrawFrame function): <a href="http://nemulator.com/websvn/filedetails.php?repname=nemulator&amp;path=%2Fnemulator%2FGraphics.cpp&amp;rev=0&amp;sc=0" class="postlink">http://nemulator.com/websvn/filedetails.php?repname=nemulator&amp;path=%2Fnemulator%2FGraphics.cpp&amp;rev=0&amp;sc=0</a>
<br />
<br />Basically, the PPU writes palette values into a 256x240 buffer.  When it's time to draw, I iterate over the buffer and surface pointer writing the correct color values to the surface.  When I reach the end of the line, I increment the surface pointer to adjust for pitch.
<br />
<br />edit: I wasn't accounting for surface pitch and modified the code.  Thanks, Disch, for the pitch explaination.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Yeah you have the same problem.  You're just assuming that scanlines are tightly packed within the surface -- which often times they're not (Though I guess it can be relatively common with surfaces that are a power-of-2 width -- either way that behavior should definately not be relied on).
<br />
<br /><a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/archive/default.asp?url=/archive/en-us/dnardirdraw/html/msdn_directd5.asp" class="postlink">Check this page</a> -- this was the best link I could find on MSDN since DDraw isn't really supported any more.  about 80% down the page there's a brief section titled "Width vs. pitch" which gives the general idea.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Cool -- thanks for the link... that picture is worth a thousand words.  I did modify the code to account for this (I think it works, but pitch is always 0 for me, so I can't really test it).  I haven't looked at this code in a long time and it's kind of a mess.  Needs to account for different bit depths, etc.
<br />
<br />Anyway, I've been running Linux on my PC for a few months now and miss playing Mega Man <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />  I started porting nemulator a couple of days ago and am using SDL, so I guess I'll be addressing these issues soon.

The reason is because most video cards use the pitch to round textures (surfaces) up to powers of two, and 256 just happens to be 2^8. It's just a minor video card alignment optimization. Still, you should account for it anyway because it's good practice, and you just never know these days. 224 multiplications a second are the least of your problems in emulating an NES, anyway.

DirectDraw blitting code immediately below the NES palette lookup. That must make porting (even to a different Windows graphics API ala D3D/OGL) a real PITA :/<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">(I think it works, but pitch is always 0 for me, so I can't really test it)</div>
<br />
<br />Allocate a DDraw surface of 305x305 instead. It should still work if you did things right (and you properly set your source rect when blitting the surface to the backbuffer / screen).

<br />User configurability I guess is one reason -- although the main reason is because some graphics filters take an input format of a certain type.  2xSai or something I think only takes 16-bit  and Hq2x only takes 32-bit input -- or something like that... I might have them backwards.
<br />
<br />Plus I just like to avoid making my code having to assume that I'm always running under a certain bit depth.

Why does this matter? You <em>halve</em> the video data being transferred from the system RAM to the video card. Huge speedup, even with something as intensive as my emulator. That speedup would be even more significant for NES emulators.
<br />
<br />As far as (pitch - screen_width), if you're always using 16-bit pixels, just right shift that value by one when you first retrieve it, then you can add that halved value to your word pointer.
<br />
<br />Anyway, yeah. If you support 16 and 32bpp depths, no reason to remove the code that's there. Carry on ;)

<br />[1] A Famicom or NES generates a composite signal. A Famicom Titler generates an S-video signal, encoding the sum and difference of each pixel's high and low levels on separate wire pairs. Only a PlayChoice or Vs. system generates an RGB signal similar to that generated by the vast majority of PC based NES emulators.
