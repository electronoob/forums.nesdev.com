<br />
<br />I had the same idea at one point.  It seems possible to extract the netlist from the photo's, and create a model of the hardware using SPICE.  Then, we could have a dynamic model to play with to help with the reverse engineering, as opposed to just the pictures.
<br />I came to the conclusion that while feasible, it's a lot of work.  I would consider it as a last resort, but I don't see it as impossible.
<br />
<br />BTW, thanks a million Nevitski, your effort is much appreciated.

<br /><em>Reminder, there are three layers here: (top to bottom) metal, poly-silicon, bulk/silicon surface (you can sometimes make out the edges of the different doping regions).</em>
<br />
<br />If you just overlooked it, that's fine, but if you are referring to something else and I'm misunderstanding, just let me know and I'll try to answer the question.
<br />
<br />
<br />As for "complete specification" of the circuit ... nope, these pictures will not allow you to know all of that.  Even though there are only three layers, the upper ones cover too much to completely see the lower ones.  In particular, it is amazing that any of the diffusion layer can be seen.
<br />
<br />What <em>can</em> these pictures be used for?
<br />- You can see the organization of the memory (I still can't tell how many bits are in one instruction, can someone tell?).
<br />- You can see how the address lines connect.
<br />- You may be able to identify other components and how they connect / interact (to help determine the CPU core).
<br />- An industrious individual may even be able to identify how the opcodes are "grouped" (ie usually all move commands have a vary similar opcode ... you could think of it as a couple bits are the "command" and other bits are the "arguements").
<br />- Hopefully someone can figure out how the ROM bits are ordered before we try to read them out.
<br />
<br />If you guys really want, I can try to remove <em>just</em> the upper oxide and metal interconnect layer, to get pictures of the middle layer.  Then you probably could trace the entire circuit.  I'm not confident I can remove the layers like that though.
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />As far as ASIC goes, I don't expect much to be custom besides the location and handling of the power and I/O pins.  It would be wasteful of resources for them to try to create their own CPU core.

<br />Where did you read this?  I would like to check up on it if you have a lead.
<br />
<br />
<br />Also, as usual, it is always worth it to pursue this from the human angle.  Check out this article:

<br />Ed Logg: <em>I walked into the lab and they were reverse engineering the chip, and I asked what they were doing and they said "Don't ask". (laughs) So I know the company was doing it, and <span style="text-decoration: underline">I knew the people involved doing it.</span></em>
<br />
<br />It is a starting lead.  All we need is for them to tell us what CPU core they used (I think this is a reasonable/possible question to get an answer to).  Anyone willing to follow the trail?

<br />Neviksti, if you are reasonably sure there's a good chance you can get to the other layer, I say go for it.  It would probably be pretty useful.
<br />
<br />Did anyone stitch these scans together?
<br />
<br />Would it be easier to get the other side if you got another chip and went in through the bottom instead?  Just a shot in the dark here since I've never pulled a chip like this apart before.

However, due to the time required, I probably won't do that unless there's a specific thing I'm looking for... specific connection question I am trying to answer that can't be seen in the current pics.)<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">rbudrick wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">Would it be easier to get the other side if you got another chip and went in through the bottom instead?

<br />It isn't feasible to come in from the back side of the chip.
<br />Of the three layers, the top and bottom are easy to get at.  The top for obvious reasons, and the bottom because it is just the silicon surface ... so I can etch everything above it away with HF and/or Nitric acid, without any worry of hurting the bottom layer.  It is the middle layers that are difficult to get at (I "kind of" did it successfully once for a chip that had a security / copper mesh layer on top, but it wasn't all that great.).
<br />
<br />---------------------
<br />
<br />To get more focussed:
<br />
<br />We need to start with reasonable/simple questions first.  Such as: 
<br />
<br />1] How much SRAM is there? How is it organized (4-bit? 8-bit?)
<br />
<br />2] How much ROM is there?  How is it organized (8-bit? something else?)
<br />
<br />3] Do the ROM / SRAM share a common data bus and address bus?
<br />
<br />These are feasible questions.
<br />Since we already know the manufacturer, this greatly narrows our search.
<br />
<br />I'm not all that confident in my answers to some of these questions, and so would really like confirmation.
<br />
<br />
<br />If you're not sure where to start, first read up on what an FET is - as all CMOS circuitry is built up from these transistors.  Important to note is what this would look like in the picture:  
<br />- the top layer (the metal) is used to relay signals around the chip
<br />- the middle layer (the polysilicon) is used as the gate signals for FET's (note: one long line of polysilicon can be controlling many transistors) or just to move signals under the metal layer (kind of like a two layer circuit board)
<br />- the bottom layer (the diffusion layer / bulk silicon surface) can't be seen much in the pictures, and doesn't usually matter for these level of questions (but without this, you need to guess where the transistors are from the other layers).
<br />
<br />Then search Google for something like:
<br />CMOS NAND ROM NOR 
<br />Several guides/lectures from classes teaching IC layout should show up.  They give examples of what a "bit" of ROM or SRAM may look like, and how it is organized into bytes, and entire memories on the chips.
<br />
<br />
<br />Here are some nice actual pictures of some circuits:
<br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.usenix.org/events/smartcard99/full_papers/kommerling/kommerling_html/index.html">http://www.usenix.org/events/smartcard9 ... index.html</a><!-- m -->
<br />This should help you understand better the role of the different layers ... once you understand that AND gate, everything should start to click.
<br />
<br />
<br />  
<br />
<br />And finally, a more difficult question if someone wishes to tackle it:
<br />
<br />4] What is the order of the ROM layout (which addresses correspond to which bytes/bits?)
<br />
<br />----------------
<br />
<br />So let us start with these straight forward questions.  Once we're confindent with these, then we can guide the next steps.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Alright! I was hoping there was someone that I could discuss this with.  
<br />
<br />Unfortunately, we don't appear to agree on how the circuit is laid out. 
<br />Hopefully we can figure this all out.
<br />
<br />Let's start with the SRAM as that is probably the most important.
<br />
<br />I agree with you that there are 7 control lines. (5 entering from the top, and 2 from the top left)
<br />
<br />Control lines:
<br />5 on top
<br />... all appear to be address lines due to how they are used in the circuitry
<br />
<br />2 on left
<br />- top control line
<br />... by elimination, this is probably the /WR line
<br />... "comes from?" logic above power strip above SRAM and ROM
<br />... additional connections = SRAM, one cell in logic between ROM and SRAM
<br />
<br />- bottom control line
<br />... is the SRAM enable line
<br />..."comes from?" top-right transistor of logic between ROM and SRAM
<br />... additional connections = SRAM, two other cells in logic between ROM and SRAM
<br />... left most line running along edge of SRAM
<br />... also is the poly silicon gate line running along right most power line
<br />
<br />===========
<br />
<br />I see four word lines running down the array, so it is 4 bits across.  I also see three address lines (expanded to include their complements, so 6 address lines) running down the left side of the array acting as a "1 of 8" collumn select.  Since there are 32 collumns total, that means this divides down to 4bit input/output (which also makes sense since there are 4 repeated "units" from top to bottom in the array). So I still believe this is a x4bit SRAM.  (128 bits total -&gt; 32 nibble SRAM)
<br />
<br />Yes there are 2 lines coming/going on the left side of each of the 4 repeated "units" in the SRAM.  But I believe one of these is input and one is output (look how they are connected in the circuitry).  Which matches the x4bit assessment from above as well.
<br />
<br />
<br />Hopefully we can settle on whether this is an 8bit or 4bit device.  If anyone else has observations to add, please do so.  With enough eyes, hopefully we can be very confident of our final determination.

<br />
<br />
<br />Anyway, if the Tengen chip is Motorola and 4bit ... I don't know how to continue, as I can't find any 4bit motorola CPU cores.
<br />
<br />Although, this was found awhile back:
<br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://nesdev.com/bbs/viewtopic.php?t=1219&amp;postdays=0&amp;postorder=asc&amp;start=45">http://nesdev.com/bbs/viewtopi ... c&amp;start=45</a><!-- m -->
<br />... but it uses 8 bit opcodes.
<br />
<br />
<br />I agree the ROM appears to have 12bit words.  But I don't fully understand the ROM circuitry.  
<br />
<br />It appears to be NOR rom with 1 enable line and 8 address lines going in, and 12 bits coming out.  But when you look closely at the circuit, it looks like the collumn select is "1 of 32" and the row select is "1 of 16" (but only 3 real address lines go into the row select!?).  Even stranger, look at the 6 horizontal lines above the ROM array.  It looks like 5 are supposed to be used for row select, but 2 aren't connected to any input line, and are just grounded.  And regardless, there isn't enough circuitry or row lines to support a "1 of 32" row select.  So what in the world are those 2 "empty" lines up there?
<br />
<br />So what is the size of the row select?  
<br />.. I'm definitely confused here.
<br />
<br />If it wasn't for that, I'd say there are 16x32=512 words (of 12 bits)
<br />
<br />
<br />Anyway, it currently appears we are looking for a 4bit device with 12bit opcodes.  Any ideas?
