<br />
<br />Well then either their coord placement is wrong (very likely)... or the Sprram Address is messed somehow (write $00 to $2003 before DMAing!)
<br />
<br />In the case of the former... which is almost certainly the problem... double-check to make sure you really ARE moving all your sprites properly... because you obviously aren't if they're being placed at 0,0 when that's not what you wanted.

This zero-filled memory generally includes a copy of OAM, which most programs seem to stick at CPU$0200-$02FF. But in 8x16 pixel sprite mode, values of $00 $00 $00 $00 mean "draw a sprite whose upper left corner is at pixel coordinates (0, 1) using tile data at PPU$0000-$001F, not flipped, in front of the background, with colors located at PPU$3F11-$3F13". Use a value between $EF and $FF when clearing out the sprite page, and the PPU will interpret the unused memory as "draw a sprite below the bottom of the screen", hiding the garbage.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I personally like have a routine that I call at the end of the sprite-drawing part of my frame, that will clear all unused sprites.
<br />During the writing part I always have my X indexes where in OAM I'm writing to. You can do it with Y, or store it in a variable, the method itself is irrelevant.
<br />Then, when it's time to write something to $200,X or $200,Y (or anithing else than $200, again, the exact values are irrelevant) check for a variable called SprReady or something, if isn't zero, then don't write anything to SPR RAM (if will be clear anyway cause of VBlank, see below). Once you wrote a single sprite, check for your X or Y or whatever index register to overlaps from $fc to $00 ($fc will be the last sprite possible). If you use another value than $4 to add for sprite cycling, that doesn't change anything scince you sart at zero (see <a href="http://nesdev.com/bbs/viewtopic.php?t=469&amp;sid=61b95cabd1e61841994eedd268078fa1" class="postlink">http://nesdev.com/bbs/viewtopic.php?t=469&amp;sid=61b95cabd1e61841994eedd268078fa1</a> for more details).
<br />Then, if all 64 sprites are being already mazed, set the SpriteReady variable, so you will never override sprite 0 for hit detection (if you don't have any hit detection, the fact to overlapp from possible 64 sprites won't affect the game, but it is still better to do that).
<br />Then, once all your software sprites are mazed into hardware sprites, call the "ClearRemainingSprites" routine, that will check for the SpriteReady variable, and return immediately if set (all sprites were mazed). Else, take the index variable that was indexing the OAM buffer at $200,X, and clear all remaining adresses with the value $f0 until the whole OAM is full. Then, set the SpriteReady variable.
<br />At VBlank, do sprite DMA only if SpriteReady variable is set, and clear it. So it will be clear anyway once out of VBlank. Now, the whole loop has been presented, and that should setup all your sprites corecly. Did you get it ?

My game works very fine and properly on Nintendulator(the best and most accurate emulator ever!), and it doesn't work to well on FCEUXD Ultra, or JNES, or (like anyone cared ever in their whole life)NESticle. In FCE UXD ultra, it loads the sprites improperly, and the left key function doesn't work. In JNES/NESticle, it just shows a black screen. Do you think it will work on real hardware if it works on Nintendulator? Do you think the code is fine if it works on Nintendulator, regardless of how it works on other emus?

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I think it's a bad idea to write code which requires any more of the hardware than necessary. If you can change your code slightly and have it work on all emulators, why not? Maybe one could argue that leaving it as-is encourages emulator authors to improve their emulators; if so, I can provide you with simple code that you can insert that will probably prevent your game from running on all emulators, but not on a real NES.

Okay, I'm making a short program that will simulate the FFVII menu, and I load the portraits as 6 8x16 sprites. There's a glitch with FCEUXD, and I think NEStopia, that makes the first portrait load only 3 or 4 of the 6 sprites. But most emus like virtuanes, nintendulator, nnnesterj, they work fine on. Do you think it's reliable code for the real NES? Because I WILL be putting this demo on the NES if it ends up working in the end.

I mean unless you're doing very precise timing tricks or relying on weird PPU operations there's no reason why something as simple as displaying sprites to the screen wouldn't work in every emulator around.
<br />
<br />Unless you <strong>know</strong> that the problem is with the emulator... then assume the problem is in your game and try to fix it.  Fortunately, FCEUXD is one of the emus which is having a problem... so you can use its debugger to track down the problem.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I 100% agree with Dish. I think that you should track your problem because displaing sprites is something simple, that even Nesticle should emulate right.
<br />- Did you make sure to do sprite DMA during VBlank ?
<br />- Do you make sure to write the good value to $4014, and not increment it, ror it or whatever (I think that you're doing nothing of theese, but that would sure cause many problems)
<br />- Do you do sprite DMA only once in a VBlank ?
<br />- Are you incrementing your sprite index by 4 every sprite, or do you have some kind of sprite cycling incorporated ? If so, did you make sure it works proprely ?
<br />- Is there more than 8 sprites on a single scanline ? Because you can have some emus allowing show more than 8 sprites per scanline, so that would work, and not work with others
<br />- Do you setup palettes proprely during VBlank or during a routine that turns the screen off via $2001 ?
<br />- Do you make sure to not read $2000, $2001, $2003, $2005, $2006 or whatever ? (write-only registers)
<br />- If you use a MMC1, did you make sure to reset the latches (writing $80 to any of the registers) at reset, at least once (this can be done easily by incrementing any value above $80 in PRGROM, so it will write back with bit 7 set), and then write to all registers 5 times bit per bit (and not 4 times because you don't use all bits or something) ?
<br />
<br />Well, it's kind of questions to ask when such problems happens. Usually, when my programm doesn't work with an emulator, even Nesticle, I always try to know why. Because it doesn't setup scroll corectly, because it doesn't emulate the mapper you use proprely, etc....

I realized that I enabled the NMI routine (which does my sprite loading) way too soon. I enabled it on reset, and that was a bad idea. Now I enabled it after writes to variables in sprite dma. It still doesn't work in FCEUXD ultra, but i'll look at the debugger thing.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Effectively, NMI should be off at reset and turned on at least after the 2 waited frames. If you do like I said, and if you clear the RAM at reset, your flag SpriteDMAReady should be clear, so no sprite DMA should happen until something is in set. Also, it would be a good idea to keep the NMI and the sprite bit in $2001 (I don't remember if it's bit 3 or bit 4) off until the whole thing is loaded proprely.
