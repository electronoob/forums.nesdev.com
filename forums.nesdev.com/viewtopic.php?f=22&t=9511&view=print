Then you can do like Super Mario Galaxy does with some of its sound effects: change the notes to fit the current chord. Or you can do like Lumines and Meteos: delay certain sound effects until the next eighth note so that they sound like part of the music.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">ccovell wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">In CaDa, you have to reverse your polarity in order to pick up the right charged balls, and your polarity affects which springboxes, etc, you can use.</div><br />So like Ikaruga if it were a platformer instead of a bullet hell shooter.<br /><br />Why do I mention other games that use similar elements? One advantage of being aware of these other games is that if you can show that these elements are tropes, rather than something distinctive to one game, you're less likely to get sued for copying too much.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Yes, but unfortunely, one guy chenged his mind about permission to use his music in the game(2 files, actualy). He gave me no excuse why.<br />I have already found another one. However, he send me a extra, third, music file and said that if I find it interesting, then I can use it in the game.<br />The thing is...I really like it! So I decided to delay release of the game(which was already too late) and add extra world with extra music.<br />I need to...&quot;make&quot; some space by opimizing the code, and optimizing data. I love this stuff.<br />So, if anywaone's still interested...I guess the new release date is somewhere near christmas.<br /><br />Sorry about all this, but it really is not my fault <img src="./images/smilies/icon_neutral.gif" alt=":|" title="Neutral" /><br />I really belived that Inversion can get released at 06.12.
