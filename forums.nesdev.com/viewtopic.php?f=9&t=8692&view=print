		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I recently won my fleabay auction for an arkanoid w/ controller, and was excited to try my new vaus out on my powerpak. No dice. Paddle works with original cart,  nothing w/ powerpak. Paddle test rom shows erratic function, but on port 1. Running current powerpak mappers from retrousb and loopy mappers on top of that. Am I missing something?  Hoping to get this resolved before my parts come in to make my own paddle. Thanks

<br />
<br />Or else perhaps you're using a JP ROM with a US Vaus?  I dunno if the Vaus controller is accessed differently on the NES or Famicom or not.

So now I need to make an adapter to go from my expansion port to a nes controller. Best info I collude find is that the fami controller port is essentially the same as the nes expansion port.   Guess I could find a us arkanoid rom,  but then ark ii is fami only so...

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Semi final report on my findings. US arkanoid rom works fine on powerpak with either real vaus, or homemade one w/adc4028. The rest of the roms I tested (arkanoid Japan?  ArkanoidII, chase hq). work on powerpak, but you must replicate the famicom x-tra controller port through the nes expansion port (thanks to xious, rahga.com gamemasterquilpue and others for their research and Internet postings).  Using that port replication,  original fami vaus works.  Mapping wires from the fami vaus to the Nes vaus,    Nes  and homemade vaus work, but must be adjusted to reach full left. 
<br />
<br />Couple notes:  I added an adjustment pot to the homemade vaus shcemqtic as found on the Internet.  Original puts out 00-FF.
<br />
<br />The fami vaus has no adjustment pot.  There are also a couple resistor changes, notably in the button circuit.   If one wanted to buy one and use it on a nes in port 2 by changing the cord,  they would at least need to add an adjustment pot and possibly a resistor.  There would be room on the board. Placement of the pot could be the same as on the nes model,  and the added resistor can be simply soldered on the back of the board. 
<br />
<br />If you own a Vaus and want to disassemble,  just pull the black knob off. It is simply pressed on. The rest is self explanatory.

These numbers come from the paddle test rom. I would imagine that all of this could have been done also through software mods,  but I'm not all that familiar.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Hi, guys. I'm a little late, but I have made that homebrew Arkanoid controller and was in touch with Gamemasterquilpue for some time. Nice guy, by the way! He explained me that both Arkanoid US and Arkanoid JP uses different ports to access data:
<br />
<br />US:
<br />Player 2 D3 - trigger/start
<br />Player 2 D4 - move
<br />
<br />JP:
<br />Player 1 D1 (present on the famicom exp port) - trigger/start 
<br />Player 2 D1 (present on the famicom exp port) - move 
<br />
<br />I was having a hard time trying to figure out why my design wasn't working... sorry if this is redundant/obvious information.

<br />Thanks for your time and explanation!
<br />
<br />I googled, but was having trouble figuring out how to search it. I've found some links teaching how to limit the range of a pot, but english is not my natural language. If I understood it correctly, you put a resistor in series with the main pot to avoid the resistance value to reach zero (limiting the left vaus direction) and you put a secondary pot to avoid main pot to reach the maximum value FF (right vaus direction). Is it right?
<br />
<br />I thought you had put the trimpot in series with the ground line in the main pot. And what's this "paddle test rom"? 
<br />
<br />It would be great to have your schematics, if you have the time and desire to do it. But if you could put just the trimpot and resistor values it will helps a lot too.
