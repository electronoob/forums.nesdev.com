		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I've decided to put the header at the start of the file after all. I think that using "NES" as an identifier is the best solution. Including data like ROM name and information like cover art and such is <em>such</em> a waste of time. I am not trying to implement a ROM database here, just a header.
<br />
<br />As for the SRAM being in the ROM? Well, IMO the ROMs should be a digital copy of the cartridge itself, and having the SRAM inside of the file is a good idea. Someone said that people running ROMs off of CDs couldn't save their SRAM data. Well, you still couldn't save your SRAM data anyway, even if it wasn't in the file. It would have to be directed to the hard drive which would defeat the whole point of having the ROM on a CD.
<br />
<br />So something like;
<br />
<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">4E 45 53 02 01 00 01 00<br />|&nbsp; |&nbsp; |&nbsp; |&nbsp; |&nbsp; |&nbsp; |&nbsp; |<br />|&nbsp; |&nbsp; |&nbsp; |&nbsp; |&nbsp; |&nbsp; |&nbsp; +- &#40;to make it 8 bytes so debuggers look ok&#41;<br />|&nbsp; |&nbsp; |&nbsp; |&nbsp; |&nbsp; |&nbsp; +- Mirroring etc.<br />|&nbsp; |&nbsp; |&nbsp; |&nbsp; |&nbsp; +- Mapper/Board<br />|&nbsp; |&nbsp; |&nbsp; | +- CHR Banks<br />|&nbsp; |&nbsp; | +- PRG Banks<br />|&nbsp; |&nbsp; +- S<br />|&nbsp; +- E<br />+- N</div>
<br />
<br />What more could we possibly want?
<br />
<br />BTW What's the biggest ROM possible? Is it 512k PRG and 512k CHR and 1024k of each?

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Now, several points have to be made up :
<br />- UNIF is totally useless and nobody will ever use it aside of a few people that seems very involved to it, but this remain very few people
<br />- iNES is incomplete and should be updated to have less problem with the support of some technically complex ROMs that causes problems with the current format
<br />- iNES is a standard format and cannot be altered like that
<br />- Most emulators support only iNES and more accurate emus now use crazy checksum techniques to bypass techincal problems by the few ROMs that causes problems with the current format.
<br />- iNES have still several reserved bytes for the purpose of any uploads
<br />
<br />What should be done in my opinion :
<br />
<br />- Create a programm that have a large programm in and that can easily convert all old iNES ROMs to new iNES format without killing them, and have an easy to use interface (just like Nestopia's internal database)
<br />
<br />- Create a system that can detect old and new iNES ROM format
<br />
<br />- Create a system to definitely detect region and video standard
<br />
<br />- Create a system to found out SRAM sizes.
<br />
<br />- Don't alter the current stucture of an iNES ROM; aka it stills remain 16 byte header, PRG data and CHR Data. Battery-backed data is in a sparate 8kb .sav file, that all emulators can read
<br />
<br />- Implement the new format in emulators and force the user to convert its roms using either a link to the programm in point 1, or have a built-in converter inside the emulator.

<br />I was thinking that at first also.  But then I started to think about those who are making new mappers (ie Quietust, and maybe Brian Provincio?).  If people make new mappers that will work on the NES, there'll be need for more room to identify in the header of the file system.  I'm not sure if there'll be alot of new mappers made, but it's better safe than sorry.

<br />
<br />Creating a new, ideal format sounds just great, but it's just too difficult to do by now. It has been tried before, and always failed.
<br />
<br />Updating iNES sounds much more feasible, and could possibly solve all compatibility issues. It's not like we'd be forcing anyone to update their ROM files, but if they want to get those weird games to work, they may have to update the headers and grab newer emulators.
<br />
<br />Come on, guys, a revolution is not the way to go. There is no way everyone would agree on something new, and even if they did, implementing it (having everything comply to the new format) would be a bitch. Just improve iNES already, and people who are not concerned about this will not even notice something changed.

<br />
<br />Well, if they are going to update it then they should be prepared to convert it.
<br />
<br />Let's say that iNES has been around for 10 years. Whatever we introduce now, could last from now to eternity, so it is <em>never</em> too late. Staying compatbile with the iNES format is something I don't think is possible. The first six bytes are ok, but then you have this higher nibble lower nibble rubbish followed by eight bytes or so of total and utter crap, namely someones name which would confuse an emulator if we implemented the unused bytes but bad ROMs still had bad headers. What's wrong with my previous post which has a diagram of the new format. Not only is it very similar to iNES, it is also very easy to implement into ROMs. You don't need a convert utility, only a HEX editor, and you can do the whole thing by hand.
