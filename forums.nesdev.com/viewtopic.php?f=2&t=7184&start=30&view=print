		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />How would you go about constructing this master mapper? I thought of using a register to control the higher addresses and enabling/disabling chips. You'd write to this register by writing to $8000-$FFFF, but one of the MMC3 lines used to control WRAM (not used in any Mega Man game) would instead allow or disallow these writes. An address that doesn't interfere with the MMC3 much would have to be used for these writes, such as $A000 (if the menu is in the first name table, the mirroring can be changed at will).
<br />
<br />What I'm not sure is how to boot to the menu. The register of the master mapper has to somehow be configured to map the menu in on power up. There's still one WRAM control bit free, so it might be possible to use its power up state to force the register to the value that selects the menu banks (for simplicity, this value could be all 1s or all 0s).
<br />
<br />Sounds to me like the master mapper can be built with 2 or 3 chips (the register and some AND/OR gates).
<br />
<br />EDIT: Mapping the register to $6000-$7FFF is a very good idea! But still, how are you going to boot to the menu?

<br />Google power-on reset, and make sure the menu's bank number gets loaded.
<br />
<br />I think we can do this with a 74HC161, a couple quad NANDs (74HC00), and some sort of POR circuit to generate a pulse on the 161's CLEAR input. I'd recommend against the sort of POR in the NES-EVENT board, which depends on a signal not present in toploaders.

<br />Couldn't you avoid (at least some of) the NANDs by using a register with more bits than the 74HC161? For example, instead of using one bit to select between CHR-ROM or CHR-RAM you could could use 2 bits and control each chip directly. You'd just have to be careful to not enable both chips at the same time, something the menu would obviously never do.
<br />
<br />I read a little about the POR circuit, but since I don't know much about this stuff I'm still wondering if it wouldn't be easier to use an output pin of the MMC3 with a known power up state (like the WRAM control bits) and AND/OR that with the outputs of the bank selection register to force all bits to 0 or 1. If the WRAM bits can really be used that way, you'd just switch them to the opposite value right before jumping to the address pointed by the reset vector of the game.
<br />
<br />EDIT: You only have to force the PRG bits to a known state, the menu itself could do the CHR configuration. Does anyone know if the power up state of the WRAM control lines of the MMC3 is consistent? If it is, this mapper can probably be made with only 2 chips (8-bit register + AND/OR), although you'd have to use two PRG-ROM chips, because only the larger games will use A18 from the MMC3.

<br />OK, but I don't think that matters, the WRAM lines can still be used to force the menu bank if their power up state is consistent. Once the game boots to the correct bank, no matter if mapper writes are enabled or not, you can copy the bankswitching code to RAM and jump to it. Then you can enable/disble WRAM at will (because RAM is always mapped, so it doesn't matter what happens to the ROM area) in order to stop forcing the menu bank, and finally properly select the boot bank and jump back to it.
<br />
<br />EDIT: I'm just trying to propose the simplest solution possible, but if you guys, who know much more about hardware than I do, say that what I'm suggesting is not possible, I'll believe you. I would just like to know why, of course.

Now if you could make this a reality and provide an IPS or some sort of loader to put this all together like Mottzilla did with his 11 in 1. Then the less educated like myself could enjoy such a thing.

<br />IMO, the software is the easiest part... Hacking MM1 and MM2 should be fairly easy, the hardware part is the tough one!

Would you or rather could you, use the 74161 to control the power supply to each chip? Or would you use another signal? Just curious what your idea is for that.

But yeah, my idea was to use the 74161 (or something with more bits if 4 aren't enough) to enable and disable the various chips, as well as controlling the higher address lines to select the different games. I believe that the games can be ordered in a way that minimizes the number of control lines needed.
