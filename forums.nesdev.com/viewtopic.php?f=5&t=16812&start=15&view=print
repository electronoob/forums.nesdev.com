Shipping unfinished products has become a very deliberate marketing strategy in recent years.</div><br />Yes, some are released like that, because they can be. The vast majority of users will download and install patches. Nobody sets out with this as a target goal*; a game that's unfinished at launch is <em>terrible</em> marketing. That's not a marketing strategy, that's a coping strategy. It's a desperate attempt to get enough momentum to continue working on the game.<br /><br />That's beside the point I'm making though. My point is that <em>most</em> switch/PS4 games are &quot;complete&quot; and playable 100% offline, and they really do QA for this. If you want to play your PS4 offline, you can actually DO it; the majority of games are fine on disc.<br /><br />There <em>are</em> games that suck at release and later get a little better, but if you're comparing against the average NES game... they just suck at release <em>and forever</em> instead.<br /><br />Already there's more than twice as many games out for PS4 than the NES had in its entire lifetime. There's more visible coverage of games than ever, and there's just more games overall, so it's easy to point to examples where a game did a bad thing. The equivalent of &quot;unfinished at release&quot; is just either cancelled, or released as a terrible game anyway in the NES era.<br /><br />The nice thing about all this extra visible coverage is at least you have a much better chance to spot the duds before you buy them.<br /><br /><br />* Well, there's early access but that's a bit of a different situation, and not applicable to major consoles.

Did you find yourself wanting to make it go offline and online again frequently? (I never wanted to force it offline, but I did wish it was easier to switch the WiFi connection because I sometimes took it to a friend's house.)<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">Rahsennor wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">I will not be buying a Switch.</div><br />I wouldn't get a Switch either.<br /><br />In my view the Wii U had about 10 worthy games, and then between Wii emulation and Virtual Console (eventually) there was a bunch decent backlog stuff on it, if you hadn't played it before.<br /><br />The Switch, with no backward compatibility and no VC... not really expecting enough to appear there unless it lasts many years, unlike the Wii U.

If you already bought a Wii U (or possibly even if you haven't), don't get a Switch. The <s>worst</s> &quot;best&quot; game on the Switch, Breath of the Wild, is on the Wii U. The performance is worse, but the performance on the Switch version is bad anyway (especially for the Xbox 360 visuals). I personally don't like any Mario Kart game other than Super Mario Kart, but there's no reason to get Mario Kart 8 Deluxe 8 Deluxe if you already have Mario Kart 8 (unless you were <em>that</em> distraught about having no Battle Mode). I'll be damned if ARMS keeps you entertained for more than 30 minutes. Nobody gives a shit about Pokken, but it's also on the Wii U anyway. While Mario Kart 8 Deluxe is Mario Kart 8 with slight improvements (except removing firehopping, because people who lacked enough skill to do it kept whining to Nintendo), Splatoon 2 is an inferior version of Splatoon 1, even before all of Splatoon 1's updates (the contents of which should have been there on Splatoon 2's release). I don't know about Super Mario Odyssey; it's supposed to be very good, but so was Breath of the Wild. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_neutral.gif" alt=":|" title="Neutral" />

I think you might have a little too much faith in the integrity of triple A video game marketing. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />EDIT: Don't know why I specifically mentioned triple-A. This happens anywhere someone's trying to make money off video games. I can tell you with 100% certainty that companies deliberately cut down severely on the QA process knowing that they can always fix issues that might exist when the game goes gold later - some times still before the actual release through a day one patch.

Linux for instance insists on upgrading constantly, even debian stable distribution which is supposed to be stable has upgrades every week or so you should install. Why ?<br /><br />Thanks to the internet, we can constantly download patches that fix vulnerabilities. But the internet is the reason those vulnerabilities exists in the 1st place. Thus if a machine can live without being connected, it's best to leave it unconnected, a lot of vulnerability problems would be gone, even if this means a couple of &quot;features&quot; taken off the product.<br /><br />In the end, the Internet is just like computer themselves were before being connected : They spend 80% of the time to solve problems caused by themselves, and only 20% of the time solving problems already existing before, but in a much more efficient way.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />At least 3DS allows you to choose when to install updates (the actual downloading of system updates may happen automatically though) for the system or for games and games can normally be played without being updated, also updates tend to be quite small. The exception are games and apps that requires internet to work and such, including the eShop app and the UFO catcher game. I guess online mode in games also requires latest updates.<br /><br />But Wii U seems to install updates automatically and PS3 seems to download tons of stuff every single time you start something. I wonder how the Switch works.

(...and patches normally install in the background when you're not using the thing rather than right before you play the game. You only get interrupted for a first-time play, and only if you don't choose to skip it.)<br /><br />On both of these fronts it's a vast improvment over the last generation.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I really wish I could share rainwarrior's enthusiasm. The PS4 definitely works better than PS3, but Sony's patching system is still incredibly dumb. You pretty much need to re-download every single asset of a game to patch some minor changes in the code. Back in the previous generation, PS3 updates of several gigs would be a few megabytes in their X360 counterparts. Now that PS4 is my &quot;system of choice&quot; for this generation, it actually makes me miss the previous one.
