<br />DSP-1 supposedly works, but neither I nor any of the other testers have been able to get any games using other chips (SuperFX, Cx4 etc) to work so far. This may be solved with software updates in the future though - keep in mind that this is a very new product (it's not even on sale yet).
<br />You need to keep in mind that a physical cart with the same chip is required. There's a connector on the back of the Myth where you plug in the extra cart.

<br />Unless CompactFlash dies. SmartMedia, for instance, has already been replaced with xD-Picture cards, and those in turn got replaced with SD cards.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />The issue with their Flash Carts is that it's not like just any GBA cart with a FlashROM will work. Only their own work as I've heard. And they do not sell them as cheaply as the ones you linked to recently. And ofcourse should they get sued out of existence or something you'd have to hope for someone else to make cart clones. 
<br />
<br />But, atleast the Sega Genesis/Megadrive supports their "Neo2-SD" cartridge, which is a GBA cartridge with SD card slot. I would imagine the SNES cartridge will support this eventually.
<br />
<br />I highly doubt that the Neo SNES cartridge supports anything that existing Copiers and the PowerPAK don't. Adding SuperFX, SA-1, and probably the others chips as well would probably not be something they would do. But you can't take points away from them since nobody supports those. There was some post though showing Super Mario RPG, as if to suggest SA-1 was supported. If it is that would be a nice plus.
<br />
<br />Anyway I agree with the opinion that the more Flash carts available the better.

<br />I know I'm getting out-topic, but it never worked for me. It justs erase my save and run the previously loaded programm in the GBA cart. It's probably because my GBA flash cart isn't the same brand as my DS flash cart <img src="./images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" alt=":(" title="Sad" />

To use Neoflash products in the future will probably require resorting to some form of virtualization.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">I highly doubt that the Neo SNES cartridge supports anything that existing Copiers and the PowerPAK don't.</div>
<br />The idea is to have a game cart of the same type plugged in to the back of the Myth. Reports so far say that DSP-1 games are working (with some exceptions, like Pilotwings). I'm not sure if that solution is possible for something like the SA-1, but we'll have to wait and see what happens when Neoflash updates their programmer software and/or FPGA core (the cart has a connector hidden inside the shell for upgrading the core AFAIK).
<br />
<br />I agree that the more of these carts we've got the better. I have both a PowerPak and a Myth and I like both of them.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I wouldn't much care what it looks like if it supported Super FX &amp; SA-1. The problem is Super FX and SA-1 with people suggesting plugging in a cartridge is that just won't work. The cartridge edge doesn't give all the SFX or SA-1 signals. Those are just the outputs to the system. The Super FX has direct ROM access. Infact as I recall the Super FX, is actually what feeds the ROM to the system as inside the SuperFX is management hardware to allow Super FX and the Host SNES CPU to both access the same ROM. 
<br />
<br />But reguardless of those details, the only way for them to support Super FX or SA-1 would be if they can put it on the FPGA that's supposed to be on there. I rather doubt that will happen. I also think that if something like that were to happen that Super FX seems more likely than SA-1. But we'll see what happens.

Time will tell.  I was skeptical about many of the advertised features for the Myth MD that weren't there at launch but they all eventually came true in the end.
<br />
<br />The SMRPG picture is called SFC_myth_action_replay.jpg.  It shows 99/20? What does that mean? Is that proof of a cheat? I would assume 20/20 would the normal max but I'm not familiar with the game.
