The picture you posted is not follow these limitations.</div><br />Yes, that's true. However, the first sprite of the picture he posted CAN follow limitations. He just have to use layers, like you said.<br />True, it will decrease number of colors for other objects, BUT megaman have 6 colors(3 for body and 3 for face), so if you plan it carefully, you can have 4 colors for hero. Especially, if you plan to have a common enemy with legs color or shirt's.

As I put in the topic post I said that this might be a game, and the character here gets turned into a machine. Those are wires and metal.<br /><br />But Im going to try and make it so it fits.

I think that the only way you'll be able to make convincing machine parts is by overlaying new sprites containing such parts, and use more conventional metal colors for them, like gray and cyan, otherwise people will hardly be able to tell what they are.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />What's confusing? I'll try to explain a bit better:<br /><br />Draw the top of the character using one palette (black, dark red, skin). Since this palette is a red-ish gradient, it can easily be reused for other objects. Draw the bottom of the character using a second palette (black, dark cyan, light cyan), so his pants are dark cyan. Now, using this same palette, draw the metal pieces that will &quot;roboticize&quot; the character (half a face, and arm, whatever), and place these parts on top of the regular sprite. By keeping things separated like that, you'll even be able to roboticize/deroboticize the character during the game without having to redraw all animation frames, you just overlay the metal sprites on top of the regular sprite.

I left some dots in first part of sprite so you can have additional, red color in your metal part. BUT you will not be able to roboticize/deroboticize your character anymore.<br />By the way: The height of body parts are not dividable by 8. (upper is 19 and lower is 17.)This will result in throwing extra sprites to complete whole hero, unfortunately.
