I currently have no devcart for MMC3 (mapper 4), and for PAL there is more time in VBLank. In fact PAL VBlank is 105/32 (~3.28) times greater than NTSC VBlank (in CPU cycles), which is very significant).<br />However, the PAL frame is 15/16 shorter (in CPU cycles) than the NTSC frame.<br />Under most case, if you design your VBlank code so that it works on NTSC, it will work on PAL too. For raster effects, if you do calculation between each raster updates (which is a complex thing to do, but I've done it a couple of times like on my mode7 demo), you'll have to manage them so that they work on PAL first, and they can be portede to NTSC by adding a very small delay each scanline.<br /><br />If your code does work on Nintendulator and Nestopia it's almost certain it will work the same way on real hardware and if it's not it is certainly for a very stupid fixable detail.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=38">Bregalad</a> — Thu Sep 11, 2008 2:06 am</p><hr />

Still no luck here downloading, but my ISP tends to be troublesome.<br /><br />I managed to get my example up and running solid on all 3 emulators topbar + 4 way scroll + crystalis irq split using mmc3 irq.   Basically I needed to only use the NMI handler to update the frame counter variable, and not have my game loop in the NMI.  I've only been programming NES for one week, so I'm pretty happy with my progress so far.<br /><br /><br />Still though, thanks for posting the example Bregalad, I'll check it out once I can access your site.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3653">CrashTest</a> — Sat Sep 06, 2008 12:43 pm</p><hr />

Bregalad site was working fine during lunch time. I was able to download his sample and it was working fine.  I can't wait to get a glimpse at the code. <br /><br />This is the kind of thing beginners are looking for: in your face concept explained by a code sample.  We should have more of these for common programming algorithm on the wiki, that would be great.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3559">Banshaku</a> — Sat Sep 06, 2008 7:07 am</p><hr />

<div class="quotetitle">Bregalad wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"><br />What you have to understand is that the NES architecture is very different from C64's.<br /><br /><br />Finally, if your programm works on FCEU but not on NEStopia, chances that it doesn't work at all on the real NES are high (FCEU is innacurate, but Nestopia is very accurate). The problem is probably how you set up your IRQ (do you do it between MMC3's counter limitations, discussed very recently on this forum ?) or how you write to the scroll registers.<br /></div><br /><br />Yeah thats a good synopsis of C64 vs NES, my big reason for going with the NES was actually the ROM page swapping, and the the fact that turinign on multi-color tiles on the C64 gives you half res unless one uses some crazy tricks.  That and there just something I like about the 4 color tiles and the way they look NTSC.<br /><br />On Nestopia, one thing that got me at first was I needed to write $40 to $4017 to disable the frame irqs.  <br /><br />About the MMC counter limitations.  I'm going to have to look into that a bit more.  Bottom status bar I can get working Nestopia, but the top one still evades me.   With enough time I think I can get it workign on all 3.<br /><br />Another weird thing, mid-frame palette changes work on jnes for me but not reliably on FCEUX.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3653">CrashTest</a> — Thu Sep 04, 2008 10:16 pm</p><hr />

I'm sure you can turn off the display for one scanline just to update coordinate of a few sprites, and it will work fine.  You'll just get a spriteless scanline below where you turned the screen back on.<br />But you need to turn the display off because the PPU is always accessing the sprite memory.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=53">Dwedit</a> — Thu Sep 04, 2008 12:50 pm</p><hr />

<div class="quotetitle">Disch wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"><br />I wasn't aware of any bugs/quirks with updating with $2004.<br /></div><br />I'm pretty sure someone mentioned a few reasons not to use those registers besides time... Sorry if I can't remember who, or what the reasons were...<br /><br />I just have this voice in the back of my head that says "someone at NESDEV said that $2003/$2004 are evil, use the DMA instead". I hear a bunch of similar voices because of things I read here, and I just can't remember the reasoning behind all of them.<br /><br />Sorry if I'm wrong. Just test the thing on a real NES and stick to what works.<br /><br />P.S.: I don't actually hear voices (O_o), that's just a figure of speech.<br /><br />EDIT: Maybe it was <a href="http://nesdev.com/bbs/viewtopic.php?p=658#658" class="postlink">this post by tepples</a>? I'm too lazy to keep searching, but maybe it had to do with OAM being DRAM and all.<br /><br />EDIT 2: There is also <a href="http://nesdev.com/bbs/viewtopic.php?p=11925#11925" class="postlink">this comment by Memblers</a>, about demos that don't work (although the demos might not have worked for other reasons?). Anyway, I didn't know much back then, so these recommendations might have been enough for me to avoid those registers.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=95">tokumaru</a> — Thu Sep 04, 2008 5:59 am</p><hr />
