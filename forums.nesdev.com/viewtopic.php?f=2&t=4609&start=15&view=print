So if this is correct (don't remember exactly how the swapping mechanism works), a CDL file still does not contain any information about a byte's origin, right? Say if according to a CDL file the byte at 0x8000 has been marked as code, how do you know which of the ROM's page it corresponds to (eventually the rom banks may have been switched/swapped, right?)?
<br />Thanks for clarifying.

<br />I am a bit unlucky with the current mapping of both data and disassembly. Because for now, each byte of a PRG bank is being mapped to the address taken from the CDL file. So in the end this might lead to conflicts, say if several bytes (from different banks) are being mapped to the same addresses. Any ideas/suggestions?

<br />
<br />I.e. say if both the byte at offset 0 of PRG bank 0 and PRG bank 1 are being mapped to 0x8000 at some point in time (due to a bank swap), the CDL file will save that information on the one hand, on the other hand it's missing any time stamp information. This is why I think you can't really improve a disassembly with the aid of a CDL file.

<br />Yeah I guess you're right. We need some kind of extended CDL for that... for each (4K or 8K) PRG bank it should have info about what addresses the bank has been mapped at.
<br />
<br />I will look into adding "extended CDL" generation to Nintendulator later.
<br />
<br />EDIT: Did you actually find some games that map the same banks to different addresses at some point in time?

<br />
<br />I've just been testing my code on an MMC1 mapper game: Metroid.
<br />As soon as you leave the game-intro and start playing the game, a bank switch seems to occur - I've monitored a change of the bank's memory content at 0x8000. The result is a CDL file which contains information of at least two different bytes / file offsets that are being mapped to 0x8000+.
<br />Later, when (sequentially) parsing the CDL file using an external CDL-processor, you are not able to tell which byte to map to 0x8000+ but can only wrongly assume that it is the last occurence recorded in a CDL file.

<br />Yes, that's the way I understood it. What I am still trying to do is to rebuild the address space layout from a CDL file.

<br />It's inevitable that several bytes will be mapped to 8000+, that's what bankswitching does. You need to figure out a way to have the same address for multiple PRG locations in IDA... I remember hearing/trying it should be possible (tinker with the segments or something?).
