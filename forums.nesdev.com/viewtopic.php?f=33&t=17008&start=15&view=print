Any time you need to jump into a portal, success is based on position, not timing. There are a few instances when you can place blocks while falling, but all can also be handled by placing blocks before, IIRC.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Momentum carries through the teleporter, so position jumping from should be the only determining factor, although I admit that we don't communicate that clearly in the game.<br /><br />I'm just not sure if it's better to forcibly teach the portal leap earlier in a simple puzzle (allowing the player to solve the later puzzle more easily) or keep it relatively unrevealed , to increase the sense of success once it's figured out later (although there is a high likelihood players discover it on their own in the first stage with a portal due to the player's starting position).<br /><br />After some early feedback, I was previously in the former camp and was planning to alter stage layout to achieve it, but a recent <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd2fWW2gWOA&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=1h8m40s" class="postlink">video longplay</a> showed someone someone figuring it out, and I now think it's worth keeping in as is, as the feeling of accomplishment shown definitely wouldn't have been as strong if he'd done so in a simpler, more obvious puzzle earlier.

My Polish reading is quite weak TBH, but it's rare to see a NES game with Polish language, so I'm taking this opportunity to practice <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />One thing I did find annoying so far: On one of the levels I accidentally hit the door when I was intending to still grab the carrot. It would be nice if the door only activated on a certain keypress to avoid accidental loss of carrots.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Thanks, Bananmos. <br /><br />Since judging seems to be over (or nearly at least), we posted an updated version. Ultimately, we decided on only minor updates (better transitions between player states mostly, as well as removing the bug causing the occasional black screen crash). We discussed it but opted against altering input or adding the ability to re-enter stages, justifying the latter by the game's relatively short length and the desire to keep passwords simple (and the former by wanting to focus on our next project). If the Action 53 carts allow saving of progress, I think that'd be the ideal time to add the ability to go back and get carrots.<br /><br />Download link in OP is updated (full revision list in download), but you can download below too:<br /><div style="text-align:center"><a href="http://files.mteegfx.com/gruniozerca2.zip" class="postlink"><img src="http://files.mteegfx.com/grCartSprNorm.gif" alt="Image" /><br />Download</a></div>

My only &quot;complaint&quot; is that I found myself accidentally placing blocks when I meant to cancel. This would've been a major annoyance if there were a lives system, but it was only a minor annoyance the way it is. Well done!

I can enter pwd, though…<br />[*]but now I'm on levl 9 with 0 carrots? that sucks.<br />[/li]<br />(~5 more freezes omitted)<br /><br />The combination of freezes (observed: on death, on restart, on level entry: so, probably level entry/load code) and passwords not saving carrots, and also the doors taking you out instantly but trying to redo with password removing your carrot progress, were both quite unhappy experiences. It then froze again at level 5 once I'd learned how to get all carrots (having gotten bad ending in process), so I had to restart again…which was just the frustration cherry on top.<br /><br />There were also a few times the music got bugged when going to the map screen.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I'm really sorry for the frustrations, but thank you for bearing through them to play the game through to the end.<br /><br />The crashes (add occasional BGM errors you noticed) were being caused at BGM changes (and unfortunately didn't show up during the last couple of weeks of testing, so it was a disappointment when reports of them starting showing up after) <br /><br />However, we've so far managed to get them worked out in the latest version, so if anyone notices any errors in Rev.1, we would appreciate a head's up so we can look into it again.<br /><br />Also, considering they're the top complaint, we'll reconsider doing something about tracking carrot progression and minimizing consequences for exiting without a carrot.

The change of state being unidirectional per-switch seems adequate for preventing retriggers, and this would make the required jump-pulls of switches much easier.<br /><br />edit: I forgot to mention that many of the unrevised-version crashes did not recover on Reset, but remained frozen. So…yeah.<br /><br />(ed2: short reset; long reset still got back to PowerPak menu)<br /><br />ed3: the little gif of the Game Pak going into/out of the sleeve/box is adorable.<br /><br />p.s. the manual has a typo(both languages): &quot;PowerPack&quot; should be <a href="http://www.retrousb.com/product_info.php?products_id=34" class="postlink">PowerPak</a>.
