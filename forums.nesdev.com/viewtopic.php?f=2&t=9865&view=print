This actually gives me an opportunity to force myself to learn/deal with ca65 (might as well use the same assembler as the disassembler for the stuff I'm working on, since ca65 has some stuff in it I need which asm6 lacks).<br /><br />I guess I'd best go read that ca65 tutorial-esque thing on the nesdev wiki.<br /><br />Edit: Or not, doesn't really go over the details I need.  I think there's a forum post here somewhere I need to dig up...<br /><br />Edit #2: This is what I was looking for, mostly: <!-- l --><a class="postlink-local" href="http://forums.nesdev.com/viewtopic.php?f=2&amp;t=9192">viewtopic.php?f=2&amp;t=9192</a><!-- l -->

It supports headered FDS, IPS and O65 files, though, and knows how to handle them, and will properly treat the symbols in the object files to provide a symbolic disassembly where applicable. It does not support ca65's object files. ld65 can be configured to produce o65 files, but unfortunately they appear to be stripped of fixups / relocations, which would provide the symbol information.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Thanks for that, Bisqwit.<br /><br />Your assembler looks like something I'd actually prefer to use, but of course do all of my work on Windows (XP) systems, so I'd need native Win32 binaries.  Sure, my FreeBSD box (as a server) sits next to me, but I've never particularly liked relying on two separate tools for two different OSes when most of the debugging is to be done on one (Windows).<br /><br />The feature in ca65 that I needed to rely on was the option called <a href="http://www.cc65.org/doc/ca65-11.html#ss11.12" class="postlink">.charmap</a>.  minus/Norman Yen's old 65xxx assembler called x816 had this too, via the <tt style="margin-left: 2px; margin-right: 2px; padding:3px; background-color: #3355aa; color: white;">.asctable</tt> directive (not to be confused with the <tt style="margin-left: 2px; margin-right: 2px; padding:3px; background-color: #3355aa; color: white;">.table</tt> directive).  I've attached a copy of the x816 documentation (just an ASCII text file, despite named with the .doc extension) in case you wanted to know what those directives did.<br /><br />What you have there (the clever-disasm bit) is sort of what I had originally intended TRaCER to be back in the day.  *claps happily*  How... clever.  :-)  But that leads me to ask: what generated that .map file?<br /><br />Edit: by the way, I was able to get my stuff up and working (assembling/linking and generating a working image) after reviewing rainwarrior's <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/viewtopic.php?p=97710#p97710" class="postlink">MOON8 example</a>.  I'm still rolling my eyes over the fact that ld65's layout/config file only allows hash (<tt style="margin-left: 2px; margin-right: 2px; padding:3px; background-color: #3355aa; color: white;">#</tt>) as a comment delimiter; sure, semi-colons in the source, but hashes in the config.  Three cheers for consistency.

I did, in iterative steps over successive runs of the disassembler with the previous configuration file, beginning with an empty one. The disassembler can simulate the CPU (at approximate level) and track mapper access (mappers 0, 2, 3 and 24) to some extent, and it begins the disassembly from the reset, NMI and IRQ vectors. As I gain understanding on what the code does, I add more labels to the configuration file. Some labels are added for corrective purposes, because especially in the first steps, before all jump tables are discovered, a lot of code may be mis-identified as data, and rarely the other way round. The disassembler automatically discovers some pointer tables (both jump and data pointers), through simulating the CPU and tracking how those memory regions are used, but not all. At later steps, the corrective labels can be removed.<br /><br />Also, here are Win32 binaries of the programs, current development version snapshot: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://bisqwit.iki.fi/src/arch/nescom-1.1.6-dev-win32.zip">http://bisqwit.iki.fi/src/arch/nescom-1 ... -win32.zip</a><!-- m -->
