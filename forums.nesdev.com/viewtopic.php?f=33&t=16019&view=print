If we really need a start date, I would use Feb 1st, the day after the previous compo ends.  In reality, IDK why we need to give an explicit start date though.  We really don't techincally have one in the sense that you can't start working towards your entry until a specific date.

I mean, I understand (but don't necessarily agree with) avoiding nudity and sex, but such a rating doesn't even allow blood! More often than not, games are about fighting enemies, so guns and violence are frequently present, and being able to represent those elements exclusively in cartoony ways is extremely limiting IMO.<br /><br />We're all adults here, so it seems silly to me to restrict the creativity of the contestants because of the relatively small number of kids that'll be playing these games. Maybe we should rate the games individually, and possibly isolate or even hide games with &quot;questionable&quot; content, and have the parents monitor their children to make sure they aren't being exposed to content they consider inappropriate, instead of blindly giving them a stack of cartridges and walking away. It's not fair that the whole thing has to be watered down because of parents who don't want to actively monitor what their kids are doing.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I'm just trying to come up with clear guidance beyond &quot;any parent is comfortable with&quot; which is widely open to interpretation, many parents may not even permit video games.<br /><br />Considering the graphical limitations of the system accurately depicting gore without coming off as cartoonish is a challenge IMO.  We have never had a submission with blood before, so I have a hard time seeing the limitation.  That said, personally I don't have an issue with 'mortal kombat' blood in general.  <br /><br />It may be best to simply state the goal of E10+, and recommend entrants ask for input on specific content that pushes that limit.<br /><br />I've brought this up in the past, but perhaps making it this more clear in the rules/guidance would help.  The censoring is not on the compo entry alone, maybe it shouldn't be in the official rules at all.  Put whatever you'd like into the game, express yourself however you choose.  Explicit content does not disqualify one from earning any placement in the compo.  But if your entry might have a hard time earning votes from your peers if it's excessively offensive.  The censoring is only subject to content seeking approval for publishing on the annual cartridge.  If there are enough people that want to create explicit entries and make a separate dedicated release any member of the community is welcome to head up that effort.  I may even be willing to publish it myself if there is enough content/interest.  If someone disagrees with me so strongly that they'd like to take over responsibility to publish the cartridges I'd happily hand over the reigns if the community supports it.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Trying to iron out a few question marks i have. If i would team up with more than one competing entrant (doing graphics, sound, and probably have shared design responsibility), how does that work? I take it it's the entries that compete, but we have rules for multiple entries from the same person. Or entrant. The one submitting might be what counts? <br /><br />The cash prize for teams has been made clear. I interpret it as &quot;submitter wins representing the team, any splitting can be dealt with between team members and should be split&quot;. How about cart prizes? A large team winning could be cumbersome economically if every team member gets one (production, shipping...) or is that a small matter  - or maybe there's only one cart? If so, wouldn't it be better if the team got a &quot;voucher&quot; representing the cost of making a cart, and be able to split it as a discount for for getting a cart each. Probably not the best way to express it as a rule... just seeking clarity on team rules.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />The rule as it stands is that all prizes (including the one cart) are split amongst team members.<br /><br />I realize this might be lame for a team working on an entry.  I've proposed in the <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/viewtopic.php?f=22&amp;t=14015#p196999" class="postlink">finances thread</a>, to allow contributors to purchase regular edition copies at cost.  After all, it's not our goal to turn a profit on the contributors themselves.<br /><br />However considering the state of our funds, there's room to be more generous with rewards to entries with team members.  Coming up with a fair way to reward teams vs solo entrants is a challenge, to which I would like to see what others propose.  <br /><br />If we want to reward a team with multiple cartridges per member, at a minimum I think the contributors all need to be listed with their areas of contribution in the submission blurb.  Additionally perhaps we should put a cap of ~3 copies..?<br /><br />An idea in between those two proposals would be to allow the contributors in a team to purchase a limited edition cart at cost.  If the entry places high enough for cash prizes, the cash reward would cover at least 1+ copies.  Hard to be much more fair that that I suppose..

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />User case scenario:<br />A Collaborant is involved in two entries with different entrants, to an extent that satisfies the rules. They happen to score, say, 4th and 5th place. <br /><br />Both entries have separate entrants, so as per the rules, both entries win a cash prize. (Besides, having a common collaborant shouldn't disable participation on equal terms for the entrants). How is the cash prize divided, then? What is fair?<br /><br />I think my suggestion would be:<br />Since the collaborant scored (via proxy of the submitter) both 4th and 5th place, the highest scoring place is 4. The collaborant gets to split that prize with the submitter of that entry, but not the one scoring 5th. In effect:<br />Submitter, game A, 4th place: 32$ (half)<br />Collaborant, game A &amp; B, 4th place: 32$ (half)<br />Submitter, game B, 5th place: 32$ (full)<br /><br />Thus, a submitter can't score more prizes than anyone else, but be rewarded for the highest ranking submission s/he contributed significantly to. Same as anyone else. <br /><br />Is this reasonable? Are there any holes?

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />My reasoning is that it fixes something i percieve as a loophole where the status of a contributor can give you a better chance at scoring a cash prize than one having the status of a submitter (most often if not historically always the coder or main coder). What's your thoughts on that? Also, the absense of rules on team wins requires actively making deals (which may amount to nothing), repeatedly. A collective agreement is energy and time saving, perhaps a bit more secure, thus encouraging team efforts.<br /><br />Hm, but perhaps the rules shouldn't explicitly specify how hypothetical prizes are split between team members, though, since contributions can vary, and/or if you think that is discouraging teaming up.
