		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I had a headcrash some time again and therefore had to rewrite most of my games' code. I want to make my score-counter to be made of background-tiles again and again I get a messed up screen.
<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">;load the titlescreen background<br />;turn screen on<br />;wait for start-key to be pressed<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;lda #0<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;sta $2001<br />;load in-game-background<br />;until here everything works, screen is still turned off<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;lda #$20<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;sta $2006<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;lda #$6B<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;sta $2006<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;lda #$2C<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;sta $2007<br />;turn screen on again<br /><br /></div>
<br />These lines should show a char somewhere on the upper part on the screen, just for testing. But it somehow changes the scrolling values or does nothing, depending on the values I write to $2006.
<br />I read through some technical documentation and my older posts on the nesdev boards and could not find anything wrong with the code. As said, the screen is turned off while writing to it and the loops for loading the title/game backgrounds work.

Doing your dual writes to $2006 will change the scroll position of the screen.  If you want to move the screen back so that there's no scrolling, you'll need to reset the low 2 bits of $2000, write $00 to $2005 twice, and turn the screen back on -- all before the end of VBlank.
<br />
<br />Alternatively, you can write to $00 to $2006 twice before the end of VBLank to clear the scroll.

<br />Disch: Why is $2006 the same address used for scrolling? Wasn't that only $2005 and $2006/$2007 were only used for writing/reading tiles to the background?

<br />
<br />Writes to $2000 and $2005 only go to the VRAM address latch (which only gets copied onto the 'actual' VRAM address at specific points while rendering), while $2006 writes update the latch <strong>and</strong> the actual VRAM address (on the 2nd $2006 write, the latch is copied into the actual address register).
<br />
<br />While you cannot use $2000/$2005 to set the VRAM I/O address (for $2007 reads and writes), you certainly can use $2006 to set the scrolling parameters - this is actually the <em>only</em> way to update vertical scrolling mid-frame, though its precision is limited (without special tricks, you cannot do smooth vertical scrolling more than halfway through a tile).

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />The internal address used by the PPU to fetch tiles during rendering is the same address that is controlled by $2006 for PPU I/O.  Messing with $2006 during rendering will show you this, as that will distort your screen by abruptly changing the scroll position.
<br />
<br />You can check loopy's scrolling doc on nesdev for details on how $2005 and $2006 affect the PPU address.
<br />
<br />Or if you don't want to bother with all that, just know that messing with $2006  will destroy any scrolling values you previously wrote to $2005 (only the fine horizontal scroll will remain in tact).  So in your game, every frame you must reset your scrolling position by writing to $2000/2005 AFTER you do all your drawing with $2006/2007.
