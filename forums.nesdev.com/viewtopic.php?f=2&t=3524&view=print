<br />
<br />I've already done quite the search through Google and 6502.org and while there is plenty of theory and floating-point C code to be found, there are very few usable code examples for an 8-bit 6502.

<br />Help!?

<br />
<br />Your best bet is to do a search for Commodore 64 programs that do this. Virtually everything that could be done with a 6502 processor was done on a C64 at some time or another by someone. The June 1988 issue of COMPUTE!'s Gazette had a type-in program called "Eight Thousand Dragons," which did Mandelbrot graphics. Sadly, source code was not included.
<br />
<br />The Sep. 1985 issue of COMPUTE! Magazine has an article on "Apple Fractals," which would have been done on a 6502-based system. Again, there probably isn't source code, though the article may contain some useful information.

After a bit of thinking and coding, I made up a nice working Mandelbrot generator in 6502 ASM.  But sorry NES fans, my program is for the 7.16 Mhz PC-Engine, because the NES' CPU just isn't fast enough to render some nice fractals without my falling asleep...  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":-)" title="Smile" />
<br />
<br />I'll update this post when I've finished up the PCE program, since somebody might be interested.

<br />
<br />Yes, read the readme; it admits that the Mandelbrot is flipped horizontally just to make the inside iterations as simple and speedy as possible.
<br />
<br />I was thinking about putting in Julias, but I never found an easy-to-understand explanation anywhere that said just HOW rendering a Julia set is different from a Mandelbrot set.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />The Mandelbrot and Julia sets use the same formula, but they use C differently.
<br />
<br />The Mandelbrot set use the current complex number (where the pixel coordinates are) for the value of C on every iteration, thus it changes on every pixel.
<br />
<br />Julia sets use one fixed complex number for the value of C on every iteration, thus it remains fixed.  The fixed complex number is supposed to be assigned before rendering the Julia set.
<br />
<br />Since Julia sets use a fixed point and the Mandelbrot set uses every point, it can be said that the Mandelbrot set is an index to every possible Julia set.  I will even go so far as to say the Mandelbrot set *is* every Julia set mashed up together in one fractal universe.

<br />You'd be correct. The Mandelbrot set was invented as a way to test conjectures about the set of Julia sets. Wikipedia <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandelbrot_set#Formal_definition" class="postlink">states</a> that "it is the subset of the complex plane consisting of those parameters c for which the Julia set of fc is connected."
