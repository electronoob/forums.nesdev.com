In both case the CHR banks were wrong since I didn't set them. <br /><br />In the emulator, the code ran fine, banks properly selected for both PRG/CHR without any init code.  <br /><br />All the code is located in the last bank at E000 so it should at worked in both case since E000 is fixed to the last bank.<br /><br />Interesting behavior but I don't know how much value it add. It only does that when you don't set anything on the MMC3. Once set, everything is fine.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3559">Banshaku</a> — Mon Jun 08, 2009 9:14 am</p><hr />

Sorry for the double post.<br /><br />Here's my finding.  After testing a MMC3A game and it didn't work, I knew something was wrong. First, my devcart had an intermittent short causing some program not to work. After fixing this, things started to work normally.<br /><br />Results:<br /><br />- MMC3B games can works on MMC3A<br /><br />MMC3A<br />- If you forget to init the mapper,  the program won't run<br />- If you don't set the CHR bank, the last bank seems to be the one loaded<br /><br />MMC3B<br />- If you forget to init the mapper, the program still run<br />- For CHR banks with CHR-RAM, bank 0 was loaded<br /><br />This is the only differences I found so far. It seems to be mostly related to the init process. They may have changed it a little bit to help debugging when you did something wrong in the init phase (just guessing thought).<br /><br />One thing I saw in both case is if you forget to init the sprites, you will get some garbage on the screen.  Seems to react the same in both case.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3559">Banshaku</a> — Mon Jun 08, 2009 7:34 am</p><hr />

I was going to test some nes game that never came out in Japan that I had in the past.  The first one I tested was Contra Force, MMC3B.  Gray screen, doesn't run. Took the PRG chip and put it into my MMC3B CHR-RAM and the game booted well.  So that game is not a case of PRG/CHR in sync.  Then I tested back original PRG (wizardry) with the contra CHR and the PRG was booting.<br /><br />Then I tested River city ramson/shadow gate (MMC3A) but only PRG rom and it failed.  I should try to test it back in sync.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">Bregalad wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"><br />Interesting, maybe you could mention the game that didn't boot so emulator authors could see if it does a particular security check or if it relies on a special MMC3 revision and post it on the wiki.<br /></div><br /><br />Before asking any emu author, I should make more test to make sure there is no issue with my current dev cart. There is still a possibility that I made a mistake while making it.  Once I can at the least make an MMC3A game run then we can try to figure out the difference.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3559">Banshaku</a> — Sun Jun 07, 2009 7:14 pm</p><hr />

Interesting, maybe you could mention the game that didn't boot so emulator authors could see if it does a particular security check or if it relies on a special MMC3 revision and post it on the wiki.<br /><br />Also it really doesn't matter if you used ROM data from an american or japanese game. Both are NTSC, and there should be no way for the programm to tell if it runs on a NTSC Famicom or NTSC NES (or if there is a way it should be something absolutely insane about the controllers and no commercial games did that).<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=38">Bregalad</a> — Sun Jun 07, 2009 2:11 pm</p><hr />

Do anybody knows if there is a specific init sequence that you have to do for the MMC3A? <br /><br />I made a dev cart that uses an MMC3A, CHR-ROM/WRAM.  The original game works fine.  I always test a different game to make sure the board is fine. When I did, I only saw a gray screen. When I putted back a copy of the original PRG-ROM only for testing if the game at least boot, no problem, it does (of course with the garbled CHR-ROM from the previous game).<br /><br />What I'm concerned now is that I may need some specific init code to make it work properly with my own code. I didn't have time to test my own code but I will try to test it tomorrow. <br /><br />When I tested my MMC3B with CHR-RAM/WRAM, there was no issue with other games or my own code.  I even tested another MMC3A game but still a gray screen.<br /><br />Any information about the MMC3A will be appreciated.  If I find anything myself, I will update this thread.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3559">Banshaku</a> — Sun Jun 07, 2009 9:39 am</p><hr />
