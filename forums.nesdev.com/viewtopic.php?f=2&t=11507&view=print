		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I've read so often that the one level in the NES port of &quot;Donkey Kong&quot; had to be cut due to cartridge space limitations. But isn't that total nonsense?<br />When I have a look at the ROM, it's the typical 24 KB of all those initial games. &quot;Nuts &amp; Milk&quot; has the same size and it contains 50 levels. &quot;Donkey Kong Jr.&quot; itself has all four levels and it was released simultaneously with &quot;Donkey Kong&quot;. So, what's the deal with that statement? Can it really be true that they didn't fit this fourth level onto the cartridge?

At face value, it seems completely reasonable to me that it was cut for space, though development time would be just as good a reason. If you want to argue that there is space for it in 16k, either you should detail the empty space you found in the ROM, or put your money where your mouth is and hack it in yourself, otherwise you don't have a very good argument.

Each game stores levels using different formats and compression schemes, so you can't directly compare the number of levels in different games like this. You also have to account for the other kinds of data present in both games in order to know how much space is left for level maps. What if the music data in DK is much larger than in Nuts &amp; Milk?<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">It wouldn't be the first time that developers talk shit about their games</div><br />Even if they were saying the truth and there was no space left for more levels, that doesn't mean that they used all the ROM space efficiently. Maybe they could have compressed some other data or even the levels themselves better and fit the extra level, but admitting that wouldn't be good for their image.

The real question is how long would it take to do so, and is that reasonable/feasible?<br /><br /><s>Even compression has no theoretical size limit, if the unpacking time you&#39;re allowed is unbounded.</s> <em>edit: sorry, this is incorrect, I meant something else, corrected below.</em><br /><br />So, I mean, there's valid argument to say it was &quot;possible&quot; to do the pie factory in 16k, but that's a purely academic point. Could you do it in a week? A month? A year? What timeline would make it acceptable? If you want to make an argument that they did a bad job, you have to show us that they were wasteful or negligent somehow.

There is a very real limit of how much something can be compressed losslessly. But that's really not the issue here. Things like this are almost always a matter of how much time the developer wants to invest in the project. &quot;Out of space&quot; may very well have been the immediate obstacle, but the ultimate issue is how much time can be spent overcoming obstacles before you miss deadlines, hurt other projects, or reach diminishing returns.

The crabs and flies are the most obvious case of this, as their lower bodies are one tile wide while their upper half is two.  It seems like Nintendo was so terrified of the scanline limit, they had to make each 'half' of the sprite flicker every other frame!<br /><br />Also, one thing worth noting is that Nintendo was rather impressed with the Colecovision, as Coleco representatives were sent to Japan to show Nintendo this hardware.  The Famicom's attached controllers and controller bays is directly lifted from it.  The Colecovision's defining game was their port of Donkey Kong, which omitted one level (the pie factory).  The NES version also omitted the same level.  Perhaps Nintendo made their port based on Coleco's interpretation?  There's also the whole issue with Nintendo getting in trouble with Ikegami Tsushinki (the contracted programmers who made DK and Nintendo's other arcade games), so maybe Nintendo wasn't allowed to use that version as a reference after reverse engineering it into DK Jr.  Long story short, Nintendo paid Ikegami to develop this game, but didn't they own the code to do as they please.  This wouldn't be the last time that Nintendo tried cheating companies out of giving them royalties.

In a marketing point of view that's just so terrible. They should rather have made a 5th level or something.<br /><br />However, it turned out the console was soon getting really great games if you were to wait a couple of years <img src="./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" />

The graphics were still slightly inferior (but pretty close), but maybe by this time they started to think arcade games were a bit too short for the home console.
