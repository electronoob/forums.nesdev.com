I've used Doxygen for professional work. I think it works okay. Also, you can make one line Doxygen comments if you want, and it's generally just one extra character to identify the comment as documentation, so I don't think the complaint about verbosity is valid.<br /><br />In addition to the documentation attached to discrete elements of code, it's important to make high level overviews as well, but because it isn't as convenient as inline notation, this part often gets overlooked. Automated documentation system generally do have ways to include stuff like this with the generated HTML, though. It's also important that the documentation system have ways to decorate related classes/terms with a hyperlink.<br /><br />The other side of it is that programmers who dislike writing documentation (which I think is at least half of programmers) who are told to document everything will do a crummy job of it regardless of the tools available. Sometimes a bunch of badly written Doxygen comments are worse than no comments at all, since they're just adding noise and filler that takes away from the useful documentation in the system.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=5165">rainwarrior</a> — Tue Aug 27, 2013 8:11 am</p><hr />

I use C# and I love the code documentation. Very handy with intellisense. Compilation of the program even produces an XML file that can be distributed alongside an EXE or DLL for intellisense support. I've tried using doxygen to produce HTML documentation for C#. It really wasn't too painful.<br /><br />Typically, I'll only add code documentation for something that's not completely obvious by looking at function/parameter names and types. If I write code that I'm expecting to share, I'll go much heavier on the code documentation.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=4871">snarfblam</a> — Tue Aug 27, 2013 6:23 am</p><hr />

I myself don't use those &quot;extra gibberish things around [my] comments&quot;. Writing a proper document with everything by sections usually work better. However, in Haskell uses a similar thing but Haskell does use sections and extra text, the syntax for the description isn't as long as these, and it does automatically create a documentation HTML with cross-references of all the types and everything used; the type of each thing is automatically documented and you can optionally add a description and/or sections too. However, in the (old) version I used, the documentation comments have to be a statement by themself in order to work, so you need a semicolon afterward (and in a single-line comment, you cannot put them on the same line as the comment, so you have to put them on the next line). I don't know if this problem has been corrected yet.<br /><br />There is also WEB, which does a different kind of code documentation. In a WEB program, basically it is a document which contains pieces of Pascal code (an extended variant of Pascal, with features such as macros, octal and hexadecimal literals, and pool strings), which can also contain references to other pieces of codes, and the compiler puts them all together in the right order and generates an index and so on. TeX is written in WEB, and TeX is also used to print out TeX the program itself, in a book which I have. However, it is meant for whole programs rather than program libraries, and seems to be very good for writing a paper about the algorithms used, would be one use of it.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=4734">zzo38</a> — Mon Aug 26, 2013 8:16 pm</p><hr />

I think what they did for C# was good, because they integrated it into the IDE.  You get documentation when you mouse over a function name, and you get documentation as you type in parameters to a function.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=53">Dwedit</a> — Mon Aug 26, 2013 11:46 am</p><hr />

I wanted to try some of these tools but last time I checked I couldn't find something that would &quot;just work&quot;... they always required a certain amount of setting up I wasn't in the mood for. I don't expect them to work very well though.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">Bregalad wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"><br />A part of it was 25+ times the same thing copied and pasted over and over with only a very minor change.<br /></div><br />Every once in a while I come across something like this. Lots of people prefer to do this rather than making a smaller, configurable routine. Recently I implemented in about 80 lines of JavaScript some functionality that was originally coded in 1000+ lines. I guess it could be that the people who code like this simply don't know how to do it any other way, instead of just being lazy.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=95">tokumaru</a> — Mon Aug 26, 2013 11:28 am</p><hr />

Did you guys know about those tools which can analyse code automatically or semi-automatically and generate a HTML file which doccuments it ?<br /><br />Well I have to do something like that at work, but to be honest...<br />I don't like it.<br /><br />My reasons are the following :<br /><br />1) It doesn't document the code at all, but just gives an overview of functions' name and variables names, etc...<br />While it's true an overview is nice to have, you can use CTRL+F for very similar resules, and this is not needed if the names were picked in an appropriate way<br /><br />2) You have to add extra gibberish things around your comments. This actually makes the comments in some way less readable.<br /><br />Something like :<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">   /****f* /main/wathever<br />    * NAME<br />    *   wathever<br />    * DESCRIPTION<br />    *   This function does XXXX<br />    * SOURCE<br />    */<br /></div><br /><br />is more weighty and less readable than<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">/* This function does XXX */<br /></div><br /><br />I lack a 3) argument, but anyways, I think this tool was made by bad coders (tm) who were not able to self document their code, and claim they work very professionally.<br /><br />I'd like to hear you guy's opinion. At first it sounds like a good idea, but overall I've mixed feeling about it...<br /><br />PS : I had to touch up some existing source code from some other company (I'm not too sure where it's from) and it's definitely the worst program I've ever seen. A part of it was 25+ times the same thing copied and pasted over and over with only a very minor change.<br />(and it had nothing to do with assembly unrolled for speed, before anyone would mention this)<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=38">Bregalad</a> — Mon Aug 26, 2013 8:47 am</p><hr />
