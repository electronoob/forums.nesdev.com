I wonder if anyone will give coding new script a try. Personally, I will be limited by what's already available as I lack the knowledge to do such thing but it will be interesting to see what people with skill will come up with. Too bad there's no way of just using the already made copynes mapper support file though!</div>
<br />
<br />I was able to make the USB work fairly well because the majority of the socket is designed to hang off the side of the board.  So it wasn't that big of a deal in the end.
<br />
<br />For the scripts like I've posted here I have already written NROM dumping and Flashing scripts.  They aren't too bad.  But I was wondering where we should keep scripts that we've written so we can share them with others?  Let me know and I can post up the ones I've done so far.  I can do up some sort of txt for the command arguments I've got a grasp of so far also.  There is documentation out there like I said but it's all in Japanese for the most part.
<br />
<br />I've got some pictures for you guys.  To give you an idea what it'll look like.  I'll send paypal bills now, once I find out who wants a 60pin connector in the kit as well.  Like I've said before I haven't tested them, but expect them to work.  And they are an extra $4.
<br />
<br />Final costs:
<br />unassembled NES kit: $42 (still has pads for FC connector if you wanted to add later.
<br />Addition of FC connector $46
<br />Assembly: $10
<br />
<br />There wasn't much interest in fitting in those radioshack boxes but it should still fit.  The final board is 2x4.1" There would be a little bit if cutting to do internally to make it fit but there are always other enclosures if you really wanted one.  Nothing really says you need one aside from setting it on top of a coin or something conductive.

<br />
<br />I would be willing to do more runs of them.  I figured after these get out to a couple people it will spark more interest.  It all really depends on what people ask for.  I'll need minimum 3 people interested before I make another run though, so if anyone else is interested just let me know.
<br />
<br />Update:  The boards and parts are all ordered to be here late next week.  So kits should be able to get out on the 20th-22nd

<br />
<br />Still waiting on the boards that are supposed to show up late this week.  I'll post up when they do and fully test the 60 pin connectors.
<br />
<br />@OldNESJunkie:  I'm still waiting on you email and payment.  I can't promise how long I'll keep it around waiting on you.  I've got money invested with your kit, so if someone else offers to buy it I'll be quick to take them up if I still don't have your email address.  Don't use the email button because it provides an email for you that's invalid.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Well I've got some disappointing news.  Apparently there are some new features with design spark PCB layout tool I used that the board manufacture's computers don't recognize and the boards are missing the top layer of copper.  
<br />
<br />But good news is it wasn't my fault so he had me resubmit the board with a modification to the gerbers.  So it looks as though we're set back two weeks.  Sorry guys, not much I can do.
<br />
<br />On a side note if there happens to be a couple people interested in a board or kit in the future let me know.  If I've got three people interested like @Tormenter  I may order 3 more boards with this run.  I'm guessing not, but figured I would check.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />So the board files have been sent off again with the fix.  I went ahead and made a few minor changes mostly to the silkscreen adding some labeling and stuff.  I did make a few clearance changes and added some board mounting holes.  So while the set back of two weeks was a downer, the constellation was I had a chance to get the board in my hands and place all the components.  By doing such I of course had several ideas what would be nice to add, and you all will get it in the final product.
<br />
<br />And I have been able to get in contact with everyone that's signed up for the kit now.  And they are scheduled to show up here Sept 3rd.  So I should be able to ship everything Monday the 5th.
<br />
<br />Here's some pictures from playing around with the layout.  BTW the deep purple board color seems coincidentally fitting for the nesdev color scheme <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />

<br />こんにちわ。kazzo を設計した naruko です。時々覗いていましたが、写真を見てうれしかったです。
<br />
<br />一つお願いがあります。revision を 3.0 にしていますが、私が1年前に採番しています。作り直すことがあれば、 1.1 以降を使ってください。最初の数字はいままで公表していませんが、利用した MCU で決めています。
<br />1.x Atmega16 or Atmega164P (40pin)
<br />2.x Atmega168 or Atmega168P (28 pin)
<br />3.x Atmega8U2 or Atmega16U2 (AVR USB 32pin)
<br />
<br />8U2 を利用した reivision 3.0 は作りかけたまま、開発の資料や時間が整わず私の部屋で眠っています。

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />What would be cool would be to add support for sega genesis and snes, at a later point in the future of course. Then it would be a kick ass alternative to the retrode. Correct me if I'm wrong but dumping support for snes (with exception of special chip like sa-1, sdd-1, cx4 and the like) or genesis cart wouldn't be too complicated for a device like the Kazzo. I mean, the hard part is already done for dumping nes cart and I'm sure people will start sharing custom dumping script for unsupported mapper once it get shipped out so new console support could be something cool to hope for in the future imo.
