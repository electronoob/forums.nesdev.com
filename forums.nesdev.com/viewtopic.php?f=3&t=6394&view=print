		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Hello everybody. I need help with NES sound cause i dont really get it. basically what i understand is that you can enable certain channels and you can set a timer which counts down and plays a sound until the timer is zero. It takes ((data + 1) &lt;&lt; 1) CPU cycles for the timer to run out where data = value in the timer. What i have implemented is changing the reg values and getting all the data each frame.  I dont know what the next step is.
<br />
<br />Some things in specific that i dont understand are the divider period and clock. If there is already one timer for the wavelength, then why is there another timer.  One more thing is how to calculate the frequency.
<br />
<br />Also, how would you put that frequency into openal because i cant figure out how to put in raw data.
<br />
<br />Could anyone help please?
<br />Thanks in advance

Once you have that, generate one with a half-period specified in 1/1789773ths of a second. Once you have that, implement a basic NES APU that supports one square wave with frequency only, nothing else (that is, you only look at writes to $4002 and the low three bits of $4003). Once that plays the first channel of songs at the right pitch, you can start adding more stuff.

<br />
<br />I never really thought of learning how to actually play a square wave, but i cant find out how to in openal because all of the examples(actually only one) deal with sine waves and even when i change the frequency of the wave, it stays the same.
<br />
<br />If anyone could post some code or try to explain to me how to create a square wave in openal or even Core Audio for mac i would really appreciate it.
<br />
<br />Thanks

Sounds like you might lack an introduction to sampled sound, by you questions.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />PCM works by having "samples".  Each "sample" represents the output level at a given time.  As time moves forward, the output level changes.  These changes form the sound wave, which produces an audible sound.
<br />
<br />Imagine a grid.  On the X axis is time, and the on the Y axis is the output level.  Each sample would be 1 point/dot on the grid.  You "connect the dots" to form the sound wave.
<br />
<br />The "height" of the wave is the volume.  Taller waves are louder.
<br />
<br />The "width" of the wave is the tone.  Wider waves are lower in pitch.
<br />
<br />Audio has a "samplerate".  Normally this is something like 44100 Hz, which means 44100 samples represents 1 second worth of audio.
<br />
<br />In order to playback audio, you need to generate these "samples" and feed them to the audio driver (in your case, OpenAL).
<br />
<br />A simple square wave would just alternate between an output level of 0 and an output level of X (the higher X is, the louder the sound).
<br />
<br />For example, say you output the following:
<br />
<br />0 0 0 0 8 8 8 8 0 0 0 0 8 8 8 8 ...
<br />
<br />That would be a square wave.  4 samples of '0' and 4 samples of '8', then you just repeat that pattern.
<br />
<br />If you change it from 4 samples and 4 samples to 5 samples and 5 samples:
<br />
<br />0 0 0 0 0 8 8 8 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 8 ...
<br />
<br />Then you just made the tone a little lower.
<br />
<br />
<br />That should be enough to get you started into tinkering around.  If you have questions feel free to ask.

<br />Notice how it smoothly goes from -64 to 64 and slowly turns around without abrupt transitions between the numbers.
<br />
<br />A tone has a "period", or number of samples until it repeats. For example, the sine wave shown above has a period of 32, so its frequency is 1/32 of the sample frequency that you provided to OpenAL when you told it to play sound.
<br />

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Let's say your sample rate is 44100Hz.
<br />You want a square wave at middle C.
<br />
<br />The A above middle C is 440Hz.
<br />Frequency of a note formula:
<br />F = F0*2^((1/12)*(n-n0))
<br />where n0 is the reference note (the A above middle c), and f0 is the frequency of that note (440Hz).
<br />The middle C below the A is 9 half-steps behind it.
<br />
<br />So frequency of middle C is 261.625 Hz
<br />
<br />Your sample rate is 44100Hz.  You want the square wave to go up and down at the correct rate.
<br />
<br />Do the unit conversion... 44100 samples/sec, and 261.625 cycles/sec.  Want to get samples/cycle.
<br />
<br />That's 44100 (samp/sec) / (261.625 (cyc/sec)) = 168.561... samples per cycle.
<br />
<br />A square wave at 50% duty cycle has half of the samples up, and half down.
<br />
<br />So that's 84.28 samples up, and 84.28 samples down for each full period of the square wave.
<br />So if you want a one-second square wave at 44100Hz sampling rate, you fill 44100 samples of that.
<br />
<br />Of course, you have fractional pieces of the wave remaining.  If you just round to the nearest integer, you get a horrible sound.  Normally you do linear interpolation to get a value between up and down for those places.

Once you have that, get that integrated into your emulator where it's running graphics and generating this test square wave seamlessly, but not yet controlled by the NES. THEN you can start having it respond to $40xx writes.
