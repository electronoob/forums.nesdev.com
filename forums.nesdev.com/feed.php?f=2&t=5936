About color $0d, I tried the "8 sprites per line" demo on my PowerPak, and my TV was always "resetting" the image. (I could try to film that with my cellphone if someone request it - but I doubt the result would be high quality  <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=":wink:" title="Wink" /> )<br />Guess what ? It uses color $0d for the BG. So I can confirm this color should be avoided. $xD should be avoided as well, because they will become $0d as your palette fades out.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"><br />The stuff with being able to darken the colors was new to me. But it's not done very often in games, is it?<br /></div><br />Some games (Just Breed, Felix the Cat) always darken all 3 colors, Final Fantasy 1 &amp; 2 darken random colors when you enter in battle (which looks quite good IMO), and of course Noas Ark does it for the water. I don't remember any other games using that - they are especially usefull in combination with the grayscale bit because normal color don't beed much.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"><br />I don't care too much about palettes nowadays, because even if each individual color is 100% correct, each color behaves differently depending on the surrounding colors, and even on the scrolling. The only way to faithfully predict what a real NES would show is using blargg's NTSC filter. And even then I end up changing a couple of colors in my programs after seeing the results on my console and TV.<br /></div><br />This is true. You should also understand that different human eyes sees colors slightly differently, and that a colors can appear different to the brain depending on the colors arround it.<br />For example, light yellow will look light yellow if surrounded by white, but will look white if surrounded by black - there is a million of other examples.<br /><br />Tokumaru is right about scrolling to affect colors. This can be seen in a few places - if one pixel in the background is significantly different than the ones surrounding it it will seem to flicker as it scroll, because of the color filter on the TV screen (can be seen on the eyes on the statues at the begining of Castelvania) - maybe this is a PAL only trick or somehting specific to my TV tough.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=38">Bregalad</a> — Mon Jan 18, 2010 3:05 am</p><hr />
