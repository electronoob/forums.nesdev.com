However it has worked before on some games.<br /><br />It does not run any game now since it says the SDRAM error.<br /><br />Thanks for any help.

Are you good with a soldering iron? It might be a bad solder joint on one of the legs of the SDRAM chip. I can't tell you exactly where it is because I have never really looked at the SNES Powerpak motherboard..I own a Super Everdrive ($84 shipped without DSP Chip, but DSP can be preinstalled for I believe $15 extra). I'm sure you could pinpoint the SDRAM chip though, through some Googling, and common sense. <strong>BUT</strong> only do this after trying to implement your warranty, <span style="text-decoration: underline">OR</span> if you are good with a soldering iron and don't want to bother with contacting, shipping, and waiting. I've heard others say they waited for weeks before their PowerPak was shipped back to them. I'll tell you one thing, the SD2SNES will be available in about two weeks for about 2-3 days, so if you have $190 get one, but if that sounds ridiculous to you, retrogate.com also has the Super Everdrive for the price I posted above. If it's out of stock don't worry more are going to be made and Igor (the creator) is just waiting on more parts to be delivered. Google 'Super Everdrive vs. SNES PowerPak' if you want to see the differences, which are few, but there are mainly two, ease of saving a game and compatibility with the Star Ocean Hack ROM. <br /><br />Why is it that I hear nothing but bad things about the SNES PowerPak and bunnyboy's customer service being sub-standard?

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Just remember that people who don't have any problems don't usually post saying how they aren't having problems and everything works fine. I bought my SNES PowerPAK quite some time ago, and never had any problems with it other than a bad CF card. I'm not sure if quality control has decreased since then or what exactly. However the Super EverDrive and SD2SNES are both solid carts. The Super EverDrive is probably the cheapest and best general flash cart available. The SD2SNES is pretty cool too but quite expensive. you do get the benefit of slightly increased compatibility due to support for various chips like DSP, Cx4, and in the future maybe Super FX, SDD-1, and who knows maybe SA-1.
