<br />I dont think thats neccesairy as thats the more "newb" friendly catagory...but obviously you cant copy someone elses entire program.

<br />
<br />A multi-game thing seems fine.  Lots of games do something similar as part of normal gameplay, so it's just a matter of making it selectable if you want.
<br />
<br />Maybe you'd be allowed to submit both games separately if you wanted, I don't see why not.  Just say you can't win multiple prizes, seems fair.

<br />
<br />The only thing keeping DNSF2 from a proper release is the lack of a good documentation, and a lack of extensive testing on my part. I was kinda hoping to use this compo as my testing bed, but if anyone *really* needs it, I can provide an alpha copy of it. Just be ready for a bunch of potential bugs. :S

<br />
<br />There is a Nerdy Nights Sound tutorial on Nintendoage, but not in only 1 part.  There is definitely too much to squeeze into one article.

<br />
<br />Is it fair to participate to the contest with my big project that I started in march 2005 ?? It doesn't sound fair to me - but the contest might be the only way to make me feel forced to work on it seriously in my free time and eventually finish it. Other people here also have some half-finished projects so I'm probably not the only one asking myself this.
<br />
<br />I could also re-use the game engine and rewrite a completely different game, but in 5 monts it sound just impossible for me alone. Even in a group or if I want to do just one level for a "demonstation" of the game engine, it would be really tight.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />It's fair, I think it's better that this leans towards being an 'NES production competition' rather than a 'coding competition'.
<br />
<br />And just because the code is old, it's not like it got better with time, heheh.  But anyone hopefully would become a better programmer over time, with any platform/language (for low-level stuff, at least).  So it'd be like penalizing someone for being more experienced (not to mention that you can already use other people's code, music drivers, compression, etc.).
<br />
<br />A more strict kind of coding compo would be fun too, sometime.  If it's like the minigame compo, where the size is 1024, 2048 bytes or similar, then there really is no room to use anything but the most precise and concise code imaginable.
