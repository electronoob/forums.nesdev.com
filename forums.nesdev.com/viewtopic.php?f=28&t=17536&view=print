Just Google for a 128K sram sop 32, just make sure you get a 5V part.  They can still be had relatively cheap and you'd be using a brand new part rather than risk destroy a old one while removing it from the donor.  I know that it's double what's needed, but the YI board has the solder pads to support it once you scrape the mask away.  You'd have to do this for a 64K donor sram anyway.  Personally I would use a Stunt Race cart, correct RAM already installed and the only difference between SFX1 (GSU1) and SFX2 is 16MBit of rom address space.

It's tied to the sram vcc IIRC..... oddly enough, I think what would be A16 does get pinned.  I've wondered if that would work after all (I don't think so) but maybe worth a try.

I think cutting trace  and jumping with the 105 pin of the GSU 2 will work. but I have not done the test yet because the pins of the GSU are very small, I'm afraid that much work will not solve at all. Anyone here already tested SRAM upgrade on a YI cart?
