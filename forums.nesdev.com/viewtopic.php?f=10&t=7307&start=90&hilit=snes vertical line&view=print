The best way to do that on the NES would be to use mask sprites... sprites with the same shape as the wall, with higher priority (lower OAM index) than the character sprites and with the "behind background" bit set. <br /><br />When your character sprites and the mask sprites overlap, the PPU will first check which sprite has higher priority, and since the mask sprites appear first in the OAM they will win. Then, the PPU will try to draw the mask, but since it's configured to be behind the background, the background is displayed instead. <br /><br />The only problem with this technique is that the sprite count raises quite quickly. You obviously wouldn't keep the masks in place at all times, only when necessary, but even then the limit of 8 sprites is reached fairly easily, so there will be some flickering.</div>
<br />I understand. That method wouldn't require having more tiles either, since the top of the top of the character and the bottom of the wall would already be present. But can't colors only be distributed per 16x16 blocks? That'd mean either the character or the wall would have to change its palette to the other's, which would look bad. I wouldn't mind the sprites per <span class="posthilit">line</span> limit so much, since one can tell fceux to ignore that anyways. What's the limit on sprites per screen though?

If the wall tiles themselves can't be used as a mask (it will happen depending on your use of color 0), you will need extra graphics.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">But can't colors only be distributed per 16x16 blocks? That'd mean either the character or the wall would have to change its palette to the other's, which would look bad.</div><br />This is irrelevant. The background will be drawn as normal. The player will use its normal palette(s) also, and it doesn't matter what palette is used for the mask, as it will be hidden behind the background and will not be visible at all.<br /><br />Maybe you didn't understand how this works exactly, so I'll try to explain a little better. Here's the background and sprite in place:<br /><br /><img src="http://img97.imageshack.us/img97/9463/mask01.png" alt="Image" /><br /><br />The player is in front of the background, which you don't want. The easiest solution, if that grass is drawn exclusively with color 0, is to set the "behind the background" bit of the character's sprites, so he'll show up in front of the grass but behind the wall. That's hardly the case though, because grass often isn't flat, and has pixels of other colors on it. Also, you might want to apply the effect in some other areas where the floor is not green at all. The solution that works for all of these cases, is a mask:<br /><br /><img src="http://img585.imageshack.us/img585/2102/mask02.png" alt="Image" /><br /><br />The black sprite is a mask (I only used black for the example, the actual color doesn't matter, it will not be seen), with the exact shape of the wall (this is important!). It is successfully hiding the character, because it has higher priority, so it's drawn on top. The only thing left to do is set the "behind" bit of the mask's sprites, which will cause the PPU to bring the background pixels to the front, achieving the desired result:<br /><br /><img src="http://img228.imageshack.us/img228/2773/mask03.png" alt="Image" /><br /><br />I hope you can see that there's no issue with palettes whatsoever. The only thing that makes this technique complex is that you will probably need some logic to detect when the player is "touching" the wall in order to put the mask(s) in place only when necessary, to minimize sprite use.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">I wouldn't mind the sprites per <span class="posthilit">line</span> limit so much, since one can tell fceux to ignore that anyways.</div><br />But then you are not making NES programs anymore, but FCEUX programs, don't you agree?

<br />64 sprites per screen, because that's how many entries fit in OAM. You can have more if you interrupt rendering mid-frame for 5 scanlines or so to perform more sprite DMAs. Few games ever did that, because unless you have a reason to split your screen (like, there are 2 gameplay windows) you wouldn't want blank scanlines in the middle of the screen.

<br />Another question:
<br />1) DW3 and DW4 had a day/night cycle, and the people available to talk/interact with, and sometimes even the town itself, changed according to the time. How is this done? I assume every time one enters a time, the time is checked, and then the appropriate people (and there sprites) are added? But what about the town itself? Must a whole different map be stored in rom?

<br />You should check the time every frame, to decide whether it's time to change to day or night. Usually, modifying just the palette is enough to switch between day and night, but if you really need more extensive changes, nothing prevents you from changing the pattern tables or even the map.

Each frame, the game moves the game pieces only if the game is not paused. It isn't necessarily related to anything in the hardware. SEI and CLI are used to change the CPU's interrupt priority level (CLI: IRQ and NMI; SEI: NMI only). This sort of interrupt is more connected with mappers.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">How does BRK fit into this?</div>
<br />BRK always performs a syscall to the IRQ vector, regardless of the CPU's interrupt priority level.

<br />RTS on an empty stack pulls 16 bits of undefined data from the stack pointer (which again wraps around), adds one, and jumps there. I guess they didn't have enough transistors back in the late 1970s when the 6502 was designed to raise an interrupt on an attempt to wrap the stack.
