Last time I tried it, it was workable for messaging, but I frequently missed messages or edited my old ones without meaning to etc. It was doable, but it was a bit of a struggle. I didn't try connecting to servers or anything like that because I'm not enough of a gamer to really make good use of that, but messaging wasn't impossible. I'd be willing to try again, I just have to recover my tag lol. Who knows, maybe things are different; I haven't touched it for about a year.<br /><br />In any case, I do have some ideas for Famitracker we could discuss which are implemented in open MPT, and perhaps you have ideas too. I look forward to it!<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=4066">raygrote</a> — Wed Apr 25, 2018 1:27 pm</p><hr />

I think they behave like FamiTracker, which has separate &quot;on&quot; and &quot;off&quot; codes for each effect in contrast to the major module formats.<br /><br />Is the Discord chat application or Discordapp.com website accessible to you? If so, you and I could go on the FamiTracker users' Discord server to request functionality in FamiTracker to improve its UI accessibility.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=9">tepples</a> — Wed Apr 25, 2018 9:42 am</p><hr />

Oh okay, that makes sense now. I wasn't quite sure how that worked, I thought you put the effect codes before or after the notes you wanted the effect to start on or something. But they're treated like patterns/envelopes. Interesting. I can see how that would be useful. Is there a limit on how many of those you can have in your MML? To my understanding in trackers you just put effects down on the rows that need them, they're not really envelopes in that sense.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=4066">raygrote</a> — Wed Apr 25, 2018 7:15 am</p><hr />

I edited the thread, so hopefully that'll suffice.<br />Here's my MML. It's nothing but a test just to make sure stuff works.

So no extended .xm format stuff from open mpt, such as 16 bit samples or bidi loops or the like? I'm not complaining, just trying to figure out what I can do as a total newbie.<br />And last, are there any example mml files I could mess with to get a feel for how things are set up? Doesn't sound like this tool is well-known or used much, but I was hoping there was at least one existing thing written for it :)<br /><br />Thanks.</div>I think public will be better than private messages, so that anyone who reads it can benefit, rather than only you and me.<br /><br />Here is the current version: <a href="http://zzo38computer.org/prog/amigamml.zip" class="postlink">http://zzo38computer.org/prog/amigamml.zip</a> It is recommended to use this current version instead of the old one. However, you must compile it yourself (whether you are on Windows or Linux). The program is public domain and you are free to modify it, suggest improvements, etc.<br /><br />That thing about &quot;amigasam&quot; is only true for .MOD output (and amigasam is now deprecated); if using .XM, then you can use any .XI files. There is a included program &quot;xisynth&quot; for synthesizing them, although you can also download .XI files from other sources or export them using FastTracker or OpenMPT.<br /><br />About having 20 channels, that is correct.<br /><br />(It is also possible there are some errors in the documentation; if so, you can mention them and I will fix them. It is also possible there are bugs in the program itself; if so, mention those too.)<br /><br />(Note: There used to be a Redmine server for AmigaMML, although it is no longer available; that is beyond my control though, since I did not use my own server for that.

Doing a quick perusal of the readme, I understand a fair bit of it so that's encouraging.  though I am a bit confused by some parts. Here are a few questions. Maybe it's better to talk about it on private message? Up to you.<br /><br />First, I'll probably do more .xm writing than .mod because the former has more options. It looks like if I do this I'll have 20 channels (A-T). Is this correct?<br />Second, if I am using samples, must I use compatible .mod instruments exported from amigasam? So no extended .xm format stuff from open mpt, such as 16 bit samples or bidi loops or the like? I'm not complaining, just trying to figure out what I can do as a total newbie.<br />And last, are there any example mml files I could mess with to get a feel for how things are set up? Doesn't sound like this tool is well-known or used much, but I was hoping there was at least one existing thing written for it <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />Thanks.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=4066">raygrote</a> — Fri Apr 20, 2018 6:32 am</p><hr />

I have used ppMCK, and I wrote AmigaMML (so if you have questions about it, you can ask me).<br /><br />One other MML compiler I have heard of is SakuraMML, which outputs MIDI. However, it is in Japanese (and I am not very good at Japanese).<br /><br />There is also CsoundMML, which produces a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Csound" class="postlink">Csound</a> numeric score.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=4734">zzo38</a> — Thu Apr 19, 2018 8:29 pm</p><hr />

Hey everyone,<br />I'm a bit of a chip music junky and I like collecting various software for old sound chips. I prefer MML (music macro language) for composing chip music. For those who don't know, MML is basically a system of notating music in a text file and then running that text file through a compiler to make the appropriate music file.<br /><br />I've taken interest in AmigaMML as of late, having heard of it on this site. I'll probably be posting about that most on this thread, but I also encourage discussion of other tools for MML enthusiasts!<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=4066">raygrote</a> — Wed Apr 18, 2018 1:36 pm</p><hr />
