<br />I just assembled my assembler program(wrriten for nesasm) using asm6 and the list of errors really scared me.  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_eek.gif" alt=":shock:" title="Shocked" />

It's just as simple to use, but doesn't have the same stupid errors and limitations. There are more "professional" assemblers out there, but those are the kind that require several configurations (like setting SEGMENTS and LINKING stuff, I could never understand how that works) before you can make them output anything you can run, so I use ASM6 for all my 6502 needs. <br /><br />If you decide to convert your NESASM sources to ASM6, the first thing you'll notice is that there is no <strong>.bank</strong> directive, so you'll have to use <strong>.org</strong> (and <strong>.base</strong>, if you're using bankswitching) instead to control how PRG and CHR are organized. I have posted <a href="http://nesdev.com/bbs/viewtopic.php?t=6160" class="postlink">ASM6 templates</a> for 3 common mappers, by looking at them you can have an idea of how programs can be organized.</div>
<br />
<br />
<br />I have already copied the templates and I am going to use the NROM one now.  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /> 
<br />I think changing source from nesasm to asm6 will take considerable time as my program has grown bigger in the last month or so. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" alt=":(" title="Sad" />

<br />I do believe you, but those things are too overwhelming for newbies. They're overwhelming for me too, and I'm an experienced coder. In my case I guess I just don't want to spend time with trial and error because I don't have any motivation to, since the assembler I use does everything I have ever needed so far.

<br />Then perhaps we need to make a bunch of link script/makefile templates like devkitPro did for libgba and libnds projects.

<br />
<br />For big projects, I see (personally) a lot of potential in ca65. For small quick test, I would like to see what asm6 can do someday.  But some big projects were made in nesasm so in the end, it doesn't means much <img src="./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" />  All lies in the end of the programmer that is ready to invest time in the tool he's using.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Yeah, the assembler you pick is kinda like the mapper you pick: its quality doesn't dictate the quality of the software. Some people can do a lot with very little and others can't do shit no matter how much they have.
<br />
<br />The truth is that in the end a game is just a sequence of bytes. The tools used to generate that sequence of bytes will vary from people to people, each one will use whatever they are more comfortable with. There is really no limit to what each assembler can do, it's the person making the game that has limitations. I for example can't seem to figure out how to configure the professional assemblers, much like I'm not able to make a game using an hex editor, but maybe some prodigy kid out there can make a game by just typing raw opcodes...
