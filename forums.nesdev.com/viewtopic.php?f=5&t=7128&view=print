		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />NeoGeo seemed very successful in arcades, it was pretty much everywhere.  I guess someone would <em>really</em> have to like the games to buy it, instead of paying just 25 cents to play it.  Back in the day, I had only ever seen the console version once, at a local game rental / used sales place (where they had it sitting out and playable).
<br />
<br />Seems silly that the "Phantom" console is on there, it never even existed, and was just a normal (but probably locked-down) PC apparently.  Not sure how it can be a failed console, if it didn't really have a chance to be DOA.
<br />
<br />Atari 7800 wasn't on the list, but if not a failure, it didn't seem to reach it's potential (it had horrible sound anyways, though the TIA sound I thought was just fine with the 2600).

<br />
<br />...What, no room for the Taiwanese Super A'Can on that list?  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=":wink:" title="Wink" />   It did have comparably good specs for a 2D console.  Makes me wonder what would have happened if Funtech had made it easier to program, and licensed the thing for international release...   <img src="./images/smilies/icon_confused.gif" alt=":?" title="Confused" />

<br />But yeah, I've seen Saturns and Dreamcasts alot. I don't think they fared as well as Nintendo's consoles (obviously) but I wouldn't say they failed either, but wouldn't say they were that great. That reminds me....I need to play my 3DO. I just got to find the cords since I got the console for free. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" />

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Article fail. Neo Geo, 3DO and Dreamcast weren't failures. 
<br />
<br />I don't know how the Neo Geo could be considered a failure after dominating a niche for ~14 years and being hugely profitable for arcade operators all over the world.
<br />
<br />OK 3DO was pretty close to a failure from the pretty underwhelming games, looking back, but it still had a pretty large library of games which were somewhat relevant at the time. People did buy it and it did get exposure for about a year.
<br />
<br />Dreamcast's life was cut short.. everyone knows that, but in its 3 years it still sold more than a number of lesser consoles put together and has at least as many critically acclaimed titles as Gamecube. It was also more successful than the Saturn and the PC-Engine line as a whole and in Japan PCE was more successful than the Mega Drive <img src="./images/smilies/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt=":roll:" title="Rolling Eyes" />
<br />
<br />The author is forgetting Lynx, Jaguar, CD32, 32X &amp; Game.com.

Nor were consoles never released in the United States such as CD32 (because of a software patent on XOR software-sprite drawing, according to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amiga_CD32" class="postlink">the Wikipedia article</a>).
<br />
<br />But to me, article fail because it is presented so linearly. Unlike multi-page articles on Tom's Hardware Guide, there is no table of contents, only navigation to the previous and next page. See <a href="http://tech.slashdot.org/story/10/10/16/1956204/Why-the-Web-Mustnt-Become-the-New-TV?from=rss" class="postlink">previous Slashdot story about this effect</a>.
