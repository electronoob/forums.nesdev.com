<br />Which is also why you don't see a lot of hardware echo on older consumer-priced audio chips.

Most games (at least all GOOD games) has been first devlopped in Japan for the japanese console, and then may have been ported to the outside of jap. But, yeah, go with $4011 since you don't want people to modify their console. (btw Nintendo are bastards to not have let the audio in in the NES; why wouldn't just they keep the famicom as-is ?)<br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">You'll need more than that, since you also need to multiply the 8-bit sample by your volume before adding.

If this sounds wrong, then the DSP shucks. One could manually control the volume and make it louder if only a few channels are used, but normally this wouldn't cause too much problems if the DSP engine is a good one.<br />About the channel volume mixing, I'm unsure that the whole thing should be divided by the number of channels. Normally, the sound should be reducted by 3db for each channel, as my understanding. This may allow saturation on output, but normally the samples aren't all phased together, and not the whole amplitude is used, so I think it is doable to have a mixed that divide each channel by less than the number of channel, without too much problems.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">On Squeedo I keep my samples in RAM, but that's mostly because they're small and I do some dynamic effects on them, like reshaping the pulse-width.

<br />Altrough I don't note any echo/reverb in any commercial GBA game.

<br />
<br />Yeah, it's just great. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />  I played Chrono Trigger, but never noticed that.  There's just so many possibilities with it.  Can morph a waveform between square and triangle, do weird custom waveforms with changing timbre, or just anything.  And with it being a 256-byte waveform, the changes could be done subtly too.  Konami did some cool effects in the Solid Snake soundtrack for MSX2 with their wavetable chip.  I don't know why it hasn't been done on Gameboy, maybe the channel has to stop playing to change the waveform or some other timing issue?  I don't know if that's the case, but that would be a little problem.
<br />
<br />I have some cute ideas for a random sample generator too.  Next idea I wanted to implement would be something like the NES's looped noise, but you can set the loop length and the random seed.  That would be a lot of fun for some crazy distorted noise instruments.  Very little input from the NES needed, but fully reproducable.

<br />Cool ! I like randomish sounds too. Chrono Trigger has up to 4 different white noise samples, but using different ADPCM/BRR tricks to get 4 different random sequences and lenghts. It has caused and still causes many problems for emualtors issues, because the exact way the SPC decode noisy samples has been unknown for years, but now I think Anti-Resonnance had found the final algorithm that sound like the real console. The last version of SNES9x still make the SFX in Chrono Trigger sound wrong.
<br />
<br />BTW : I was wrong to say no GBA game has digital echo, Golden Sun seems to have it, but only with relativly short echo times (small delay buffer), so there is no cavernous-sounding music like there could have been. Also, I suspect Golden Sun uses pulse width effects in several music and to produce the noise when someone speaks.

<br />No, I mean Golden Sun sounds to have an actual echo programm that is noticeable on drums (unless drums samples already have pre-reverb done to them before mixing). It also fakes echo by using a second delayed channel in several tunes, but it doesn't sound like actual echo, just a bit fun, but I wasn't talking about that.

<br />You'd be surprised at how many music samples in GBA games have precomputed reverb on them. Open <em>WarioWare</em> or <em>Puyo Pop</em> in a hex editor and see what I mean.

<br />This is probably why Golden Sun drums sounds as they do, so not too bad. However, this doesn't allow a game to have the same drum sound more reverberant in a cave than for example in a simple grassfield.
<br />
<br />EDIT : I was able to load gba ROMs in GoldWave, and you get a bunch of inaudible data, and also all audio samples ! And this seems to work on most games ! Thanks for this trick !
<br />Effectivly the pre-reverberated samples on the games you mentionned is noticeable. I haven't check Golden Sun yet (I have no image on my PC, only the real card for not). I'm gonna check it later.
<br />
<br />EDIT2 : The samples in Golden Sun doesn't look to be pre-reverbed. My conclusion are that the game include a programm to do some short echo in the game.
