<br />But there is a problem : it seems games show up randomly! I feel that it is because of voltage which becomes unstable by pushing reset button. How can I fix it?
<br />
<br />Can someone analyze this circuit a little more? I want to know how exactly it works. I want to know especially about the function of Diode, Capacitor, and M2 signal. I can analyze 74xx161 function to some extent but I would appreciate if anyone can clarify it too :

<br />Wow...
<br />
<br />Much respect man. Much respect.
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />Anyway, isn't your diode backwards in that schematic?
<br />
<br />There was a post on these boards about multicarts used on the Atari that used the reset button as the counter clock, but I can't for the life of me find it. If we could I know there is an NES mapper that works the same way. We could look up the PCB on Bootgod's database and have a look-see.

The only restriction is, all the games inside the cartridge must have the same mappers, that's all. It is possible to make a 16 in 1 (with 161 TTL and 27C080) cartridge, even theoretically it is possible to build a 64 in 1 (? maybe with some other kinds of TTL which have more output lines).<br /><br />My problem is still stands :<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">games show up randomly!

<br />
<br />Also, if you used an 8-bit binary counter you could make a 256-in-1 multicart, but I'd hate to be a fan of game 256 <img src="./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" />
<br />
<br />Unfortunately I can't see that image right now. I'll have to look again later. But the way I was thinking the diode is preventing any positive current from reaching the clock pin on the '161. Does pressing the reset button change the selected game it the order you expect?
<br />
<br />As for the rest of it, your parallel input pins have been left floating. Perhaps that's why you are getting a random start state? Try to tie pins 3 through 6 to ground and see if that fixes your issue. I'm no expert, but I've always been told to not rely on floating inputs to pull high.

<br />Regarding the function table of 161, count mode is activated when the MR, CEP, CET, PE are high and Clock goes from low to high, but as you can see for D or P inputs the required voltage is X which means don't care, now the question is what does it mean really?!

<br />I searched BootGod's NesCartDB for commercial games with mapper 0, one result per game for all regions: Results 1 through 25 of 118. There are 208 other games with 256 Kbit or smaller PRG, many of which can probably be hacked down to one CHR bank with only minor graphic reductions (such as the version of Tetяis that's labeled "TETRIS 2" on pirate multis, and the eight mapper 185 games).
<br />
<br />But I agree that if there are more than 8 games, a menu is definitely warranted. Changing channels with reset is like looking for something on TV with just the channel down button: OK for the farmer five but impractical for cable.

Would beat the hell out of leavimg your eprom in the sun:D Also, I always wondered if building a UV LED arrays would work for erasing eprom... I have a load of UV LED at home but was always too lazy to wire them up and try since I was able to get a uv eraser for almost nothing.

<br />By the way, I was wondering what software you were using to design pcb. Also, are you etching them at home? Because if you do I was curious how you manage to etch double-sided board without running into too much lining issue.

<br />I am using a method called Print-Iron :
<br />
<br /><a href="http://www.riccibitti.com/pcb/pcb.htm" class="postlink">How to make PCBs at home</a>
<br />
<br />For making a double sided PCB :
<br />Cut the board at the size of front layout picture
<br />Iron the front layout
<br />Wait until the board become cool
<br />Place the bottom layout on the board and adjust it by using the edges marks (dots and connectors)
<br />Iron the bottom layout
<br />Use FeCl3 for erasing the unnecessary Cu (copper) from the PCB

<br />
<br />I recommend design spark, it free and has nice tutorial to get you going.  What do you mean by lining issue?  Do you mean lining up the two sides?
<br />
<br />From what I've seen the best way to do double sided boards is tape you print outs together on the one side.  You can hold the paper up to the light to make sure you've got them lined up properly.  Then sandwich your board between the two and start ironing.

<br />I wanted to try to learn Proteus as it sound like it's becoming quite a popular design software these days but thought it was kinda too powerful for my need. Would you agree to share the library for the famicom connector Farid?
