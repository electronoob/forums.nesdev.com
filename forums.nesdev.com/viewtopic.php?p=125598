						<div class="postbody">Hello folks. Welcome to the thread. First, a brief introduction. I go by Danin, even though my real name is Skylar. Call me whichever. I'm also very verbose. I bought one of the wonderful InfiniteNesLives flashcarts (the SNES version) and a Kazzo programmer, but the software left me feeling a little uncomfortable. I got ahold of INL, and he graciously agreed to provide me with what was required to write a new host app for it. We're taking the typical two-headed approach here. For the most part, INL does the firmware, I do the host app.<br /><br />I started from the ground up, and I've been banging on it with bits and bytes to see just how much I can stuff into one app. As of right now, it ONLY supports SNES ROMs and the SNES flashcart. If you somehow manage to figure out a way to throw an NES rom at it and make it talk to the NES flashcart, it won't work and I'll be fairly impressed.<br /><br />I am not a professional dev. This is my first program in ages. There will be bugs. I've provided what I consider to be extensive log messages that should help me troubleshoot issues, if they're encountered, and that brings us to...<br /><br />GROUND RULE NUMBER ONE: If you have an issue with a ROM, make sure it's a good ROM, THEN make sure you can repeat the issue with another ROM of similar type/size. For example, if your 2mbit ROM won't work, try Super Mario World. If you haven't done sufficient testing, I'm going to tell you to go do sufficient testing.<br /><br />Now, on to the good part.<br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #00FF80">(HOST APP DOWNLOADS ARE BELOW THE FEATURE LIST.)<br />(USAGE IS BELOW THE DOWNLOAD LIST.)<br />(FIRMWARE REWRITE DOWNLOAD IS AT THE END OF THE SECOND POST.)<br />(IMPORTANT NOTES ARE IN RED.)</span></strong><br /><br /><br />Feature list (Expect this to be incomplete and changed frequently, I have a bad memory):<br /><br />- I'm a Windows-only dev. I have two extremely old (pre-Intel) Mac systems. If you want me to work on a MacOSX compatible version, I'll need two things; Time to confirm that I can do it, and (only after I find out I can do it) for you and your Mac friends to form a fund to buy me a screen for a Macbook I'm currently in posession of.<br /><br /><br />- Presently, <span style="color: #FF0000"><strong>ONLY SNES LoROM support is thoroughly tested.</strong></span> HiROM support is in place, but untested on 4MByte and 8MByte carts. Once I get the NES carts, I'll implement the relevant functionality.<br /><br /><br />- Supports loading *.zip, *.sfc, *.smc, *.bin, *.rom as default filetypes for ROMs. Also, *.* filter is selectable.<br />  -- When loading a *.zip file, only the first detected ROM in the stream will be loaded, the rest ignored. (Proper Zip file selector coming soon.)<br />  -- It will automatically attempt to determine the ROM's size and select it (or the next largest size) in the Data Type dropdown.<br />  -- ROMs will Auto-Pad (if necessary for Mirroring) and Auto-Mirror is selectable. (Release 8) If the ROM doesn't fill the selected size, it will simply begin to upload, then abort when the buffer is empty. If the ROM's data size doesn't match an upload page size (which usually indicates an invalid ROM, either through applying a patch incorrectly or simply an improper dump) it will pad-fill the buffer to the page size automatically, and report a warning.<br />  -- (02-22-14, Release 8) Internal buffer handling guarantees loaded ROM will always remain in original state - separate data buffers are held for each state of ROM handling. Support to intentionally revert to any given status and/or repeat processing steps will be added soon.<br /><br /><br />- Supports loading and applying *.ips patches. Patches are applied IN-MEMORY ONLY, so you don't have to worry about corrupting your ROMs if something goes wrong. IPS format support includes both standard and RLE patches. Once a patch is applied, there is presently NO way to revert it except to re-load the base ROM file. (Structure for reverting is in place, but not enabled yet, I'll fix that as soon as I do further case testing.) Also, only *.ips files can be loaded for patches. I don't support *.bps or the rest yet - if someone can provide me with file format documentation for patches, I'll implement anything you suggest. I had to learn all of this from scratch, I'm not afraid of another function. (02-22-14) This operation is now threaded, to avoid UI stall and lag during the process.<br />  -- If you load a *.zip (as a ROM) it'll also check if there are any *.ips patches alongside it. It will prompt if it should load EACH PATCH found, in order.<br />  --- The IPS-in-Zip dialog will present each detected patch with its filename and Yes/No/Cancel. If Yes is selected, it will load the patch and stop prompting. If No is selected, it will find the next patch and prompt for it, if it exists. If Cancel is selected, it will not load the patch and will abort further searching for *.ips files within that Zip. I did it this way so you could, for example, store Super Mario World and all of your favorite level hacks in the *.zip file, and only load the one you want. Convenience.<br />  -- After loading a patch, the &quot;Patch Requires Header&quot; box will be in 'indeterminate' state - it looks like a little square. If left as such, the application will ATTEMPT to determine if the patch is expecting a 512-byte &quot;dumper&quot; header or not. To do this, it simply patches the ROM as headerless, then checks if the SNES data header has been corrupted. If the SNES data header has been corrupted, it will then patch the ROM as &quot;dumper&quot;-headered by creating a zero-filled 512-byte header. It will then check if the SNES data header is valid once more. If neither is valid, it will alert the user IN THE DATA LOG. If your patch is small enough, there's a good chance it won't corrupt the ROM in either setting, meaning the host app won't know, will guess, might not work when tested, and you'll have to figure it out manually. If you want to check first, load the ROM, patch it, and test it with an emulator.<br />  -- If you know the patch requires a header, tick the box. If you know the patch requires NO header, untick the box. It is a proper three-state checkbox, so you can switch between ticked/unticked/indeterminate.<br /> -- (02-22-14, Release 8) Patch is always applied to Original or Headerless ROM state, depending on which ROM is loaded and wether the patch requires a &quot;dumper&quot; header or not.<br /><br /><br />- Saving of the loaded buffer. Right now, the only use here is saving a ROM without its &quot;dumper&quot; header, saving a ROM with an added fake - all zeroes - &quot;dumper&quot; header (might add proper &quot;dumper&quot; header support later, but I don't see why so it's low-priority) or saving a patched ROM either with or without said &quot;dumper&quot; header, to test with an emulator. Future implementation will support saving of ROMs dumped from the Kazzo with the same options.  (02-22-14, Release 8) This function's code and internal logic has been drastically improved.<br /><br /><br />- Auto-erase functionality. This basically means it will erase the cart before writing - if you KNOW the cart is blank, this should be disabled to reduce premature flash chip wear - though I suppose if it's already blank, erasing a flash chip shouldn't hurt it any, in theory. Actual blank checking will be implimented later (read: when Firmware supports it) of course. (02-22-14, Release 8) This operation is now threaded, to avoid UI stall and lag during the process. UI performance and update fluidity has been <em>substantially</em> improved here. Also, core logic and code patterns have been simplified and made more consistent.<br />  -- In order for Auto-erase or manual erase to function, user MUST select the size of the flash cart using the Cart Size dropdown.<br />  -- When performing an erase, there will be a max timeout of 120 seconds. If this is ever inadequate, it can be easily changed, but in my experience an actual erase on a 12MByte board will take <em>less than half</em> of this time. The host app will watch for the Kazzo to report idle, once the erase operation is complete, and skip the rest of the timeout. The max timeout is only here to self-abort in case something has gone wrong.<br />  -- When using the STOCK firmware for the Kazzo, the Auto-Erase will presently be DISABLED, because with stock firmware the wait period (due to the not-implemented 'BUSY' reply) would be skipped and cause errors. Please upgrade to the provided firmware for proper operation; it is (should be?) FULLY backward compatible with the original Inl-Prog v1.1 beta software. The firmware is in the aptly-named &quot;Firmware&quot; directory, and can be uploaded by running the 'update.bat' file. (I made a few tiny patches to the firmware to accomplish this. I'm not the firmware guy. Regardless, I'm confident it didn't interfere with backward-compatibility with the original host app.)<br /><br /><br />- SNES data header format loading. It will indicate wether the ROM is HiROM or LoROM, ROM size, RAM size, expansion chips used, and CRC32/MD5/SHA-1/SHA-256 checksums. Far more information is loaded and processed, but not used or reported. <strong>Present implimentation will try to figure out if your ROM will work on the cart. It relies on the SNES header (not the 512-byte &quot;dumper&quot; header) to tell it truthfully wether it uses expansion chips and whatnot. Trust it, but bug me if it's wrong.</strong> Some ROMs (AKA properly de-interleaved Star Ocean) report above typical accepted size for LoROM -AND- the presence of an expansion chip that's not really used anymore, but will still work.<br /><br /><br />- Test mode. This will perform all operations and processing EXCEPT actual USB transfers. The device itself will still need to be present for most operations, but it will not write to/erase/read from the Kazzo. It can be a quick way to reproduce non-Kazzo-related errors during the erase/write process. If it succeeds in Test but fails in normal mode, it's not (very likely) a problem with my app....I hope, hah.<br /><br /><br />- &quot;Find Kazzo&quot; button. This button forces the code to re-check the USB connection and enumeration for the Kazzo, in case (shouldn't happen) it's plugged in, has drivers, but won't work. If the host can't find the Kazzo but your drivers are present and known working, the Reset button on the Kazzo will likely solve the problem in these instances - after resetting, click Find Kazzo again. It also checks the state of the Kazzo and returns its Status code and Firmware version. Currently, code (49) is &quot;OK/IDLE&quot; due to a typo in the firmware, and desired backward-compatibility means I'm not changing it. Upon hearing the firmware version, the host app will enable/disable features that require different firmware revisions. (These only include auto-erase (Core v1+) and 8MByte+ writes (Core v2+) at the moment.)<br /><br /><br />- Extensive data logging window, with a right-click Copy to Clipboard function for pasting log data in error/bug reports. Also has a Clear function. If you have a HUGE log, clear it and reproduce your bug before copying/uploading it. A 1000 line limit is in place. If you experience slowdowns due to the size of that log, please alert me, since 1000 is pretty excessive. It also has icons to flag important lines, pay the most attention to those lines. (02-22-14, Release 8) This operation is now threaded, to avoid UI stall and lag during the process. As a result, all operations tend to run more smoothly. As a side-effect of the unqueued asynchronous operation here, in Test mode, the ordering of log entries is likely to be invalid. <strong>Some lines will be out of order, some will be overwritten by previous lines. Fixing this is low-priority, as it would decrease responsiveness in all states.</strong><br /><br /><br /><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">- Firmware version detection. If Kazzo's firmware is out of date, a message will be shown in the log file indicating this. Up-to-date firmware should be packaged with the host application. The firmware is in the aptly-named &quot;Firmware&quot; directory, and can be uploaded by running the 'update.bat' file. Stock firmware will report version 0, 0, 0, and return -1 to the version checker, presently only disabling Auto-Erase. This 'Release' firmware will report version 1, 1, 1. These numbers correspond to Core, SNES, NES and change based upon featuresets supported by the firmware. The app will disable functions required by newer firmware than you've got, and re-enable them when you update.</span></strong><br /><br /><br />- Internal patcher. AKA support for &quot;Protection&quot; removal. Right now, I SHOULD have ALL games' &quot;Cart Copier&quot; tests supported, and theoretically also Region patches. These protections were put in place to block cart dumpers and flash carts. On my system the patcher takes an additional ~2sec on a 4MByte Rom.  Presently I've got patches in place for every game released <em>that I know of</em>, please try to prove me wrong! These patches are applied in-memory immediately before writing to the flashcart, and are pattern-based. SINCE they're pattern-based, there is one thing to note. There's a tiny chance it could interfere with some ROMs, but I find this incredibly unlikely.  If you find out that I'm wrong, tell me and I'll figure out a way to fix it or add a one-off exception at worst.  (02-22-14, Release 8) This function's internal logic has been drastically improved.<br /> -- (02-22-14, Release 8) When enabled, internal protection patcher will be applied to Original, Header-Strip, or Patched buffer (depending on which is most recent/still valid) before writing to Kazzo. To enable or disable this function, click the named checkbox.<br /><br /><br />- Auto-Mirroring (Added for Release 6)  This enables making exact duplicates of ROMs on the cart in areas that the SNES expects them. As far as I know (please tell me if I'm wrong) when it comes to LoROM games, only FastROM+LoROM games require mirroring. Auto-Mirroring will create on-flash clones of your ROM until either cart size or 8MByte is reached. This is unlikely to make hiROM work, but fixes some LoROM games, IE R-Type 3. (02-22-14, Release 8) Internal logic and sequencing for padding and mirroring has been substantially improved.<br />  -- To enable it, simply check the button. Mirroring presently takes place on the host app, in memory only, and only immediately prior to the write operation, so patches and fixes will be properly mirrored. As always, your original ROM on your computer is unmodified.<br />  -- Auto-mirror will first pad the ROM image to the length reported in the SNES Header within the ROM. This is so ROMs that are undersized won't mirror at stupid places and cause crashes and so forth.<br /><br /><br />- Rom Data window (02-22-14, Release 8) Major rewrite to this and its internal structure. Now has one tab for each buffer state that's loaded, to allow viewing of data for each stage, for example, to find out what went wrong IF something went wrong. This goes hand-in-hand with the new internal Rom Manager class and its improved structuring. Support will soon be added here to allow switching of active buffer, reversion, data unloading, etc.<br /><br /><br />- <strong><span style="color: #FF0000">HOTKEYS</span></strong>. Keyboard users rejoice - all controls have been enabled with hotkeys. The underlined letter, as it has been since the dawn of Windows, is your hotkey for whichever control. Also, the following;<br /> <s>-- Ctrl-1: Toggle Auto Pick Size</s> (02-22-14, Release 8) This function is now automatic, and not able to be disabled as it serves a core purpose. Auto-detected values cannot be overridden, but logic is in place to determine the correct values.<br /> <s>-- Ctrl-2: Toggle Auto Strip Header</s> (02-22-14, Release 8) This function is now automatic, and not able to be disabled as it serves a core purpose. Uploading of non-stripped ROMs will cause invalid operation in 100% of cases, so you can not turn this off.<br /><strong> -- Ctrl-2: Toggle Auto-Fix Protection mode<br /> -- Ctrl-3: Toggle Auto Mirroring<br /> -- Ctrl-4: Toggle Auto Erase<br /> -- Ctrl-O: Open file dialog<br /> -- Ctrl-P: Enable Patcher and prompt for patchfile OR Disable Patcher<br /> -- Ctrl-W: Write ROM to Kazzo (02-22-14, Release 8)<br /> -- Ctrl-C: Select Cart Size dropdwn (03-01-14, Release 9.5)<br /> -- Ctrl-D: Select Data Type dropdown (03-01-14, Release 9.5)<br /> -- Ctrl-E: Erase Kazzo cart (02-22-14, Release 8)<br /> -- Ctrl-S: Save Kazzo buffer (02-22-14, Release 8)<br /> -- Ctrl-Shift-T: Toggle Test mode<br /> -- Ctrl-Shift-P: Popout 'internal' patcher menu (also accessible with right-click on Enable Patcher box)<br /> -- Ctrl-Shift-K: Popout extended Kazzo menu (also accessible with right-click on Find Kazzo button, only has Test mode options FOR NOW)<br /> -- Escape: Prompt to abort current action when applicable</strong><br /><br /><br />My current priorities are to expand usability of the flash carts. To do this, I need to focus on two things. <br /><br /><br />First, I need to improve mirroring. Obviously once firmware-side mirroring is implemented, it will be recommended that you upgrade to that firmware, but until then host-side will have to do, despite it being much slower. HiROM will also use 'mirroring' in a somewhat dynamic context, allowing HiROM games to work properly.<br /><br /><br /><strong>I'll provide a second post here with known issues with games or the app.</strong> Most likely, valid bug reports with the app will be resolved within one day, and as such that list should be very short. I work quickly, and I don't do VaporWare, so if you have an issue, expect it to be fixed. Right now my access to INL's hardware is limited but expanding soon, so if it's a board-specific problem rather than app-specific, I'll soon be able to tweak and tune.<br /><br /><br />With that all said, on to the good part. Here are the releases!<br /><br /><s>https://www.dropbox.com/s/ov2box0rwe8ncae/Release-02-15-14_4.zip</s> (02-15-14)<br /><br /><s>https://www.dropbox.com/s/tpqn9crv2qz68e5/Release-02-15-14_5.zip</s> (02-15-14)<br /> - Fixed 4mb Cart not enabling Auto-Erase, bug report credit to INL<br /><br /><s>https://www.dropbox.com/s/w7s5dfabxheg1pc/Release_6.zip</s> (02-16-14)<br /> - Added basic mirroring<br /> - Disabled writes above 8MByte w/ warning (Library value casting is limiting this. INL is working on firmware-side fix, I'm contemplating reverting the core USB library to an older version as a temporary workaround.)<br /> - Moved Test Mode to right-click context menu on 'Find Kazzo' button, added titlebar indication of test mode<br /><br /><s>https://www.dropbox.com/s/lxbvhxwh6vqrz4v/Release_7.zip</s> (02-17-14)<br /> - Improved mirroring some<br /> - Added hotkeys (See above)<br /> - DRASTICALLY improved patcher to be more dynamic, support multi-possibility-per-pattern searching, and wildcards (not that you'll see most of that, but I'm happy with it) which means to the end user; Relatively quick patch engine that removes ALL SRAM-based protections on all games that I know of. Untested with all games (HiROM limitations of course) so please let me know if you KNOW a game isn't working due to protection like this. Don't worry, Region protection patches are coming soon.<br /> - Streamlined code slightly, might be faster but not by much.<br /> - Attempted to revert to legacy libUsbDotNet library to fix 8MByte issue; failed. Wasted time, wasted time....<br /> - Did not update help text, tooltips, etc. (It's near 1am, I still have to shower and eat. I'm done for the day but wanted to get this out there because I know at least one person is trying to play games that are protected and has to use an external tool.)<br /><br /><s>https://www.dropbox.com/s/jgtezsi414m1ty9/Release_8.zip</s>  (02-22-14)<br /> - Complete rewrite of Rom data handling, Kazzo communications handling, Patch Engine system, Header management, and Status checking systems.<br /> - Creation of static Rom Manager class internally, containing references for Kazzo, Rom Data/Header, Patch Engine, etc., as well as infrastructure for cross-class communication, facilitating more efficient memory management and easier coding.<br /> - Separated Rom buffers into multiple static modules. This guarantees against corruption when re-applying patches.<br /> - Nearly-complete rewrite of Kazzo, Patch Engine, Rom data/header loading systems for increased speed and efficiency.<br /> - Threading on core elements of Patcher and Kazzo. Fixes very poor UI performance during long operations.<br /> - Complete rewrite of Event subsystem, increasing efficiency and execution speed of Status and Progress updates substantially.<br /> - Refactor of Log Window systems, increasing efficiency and execution speed, reducing impact of logging during execution.<br /> - BUG: During Test mode, users with fast(?) computers will notice log entries written in incorrect order. Low-priority: Fixing this will cause slowdowns of most operations.<br /> - Beginnings of structure rewrite for dual-mode (SNES/NES) support.<br /> - This build represents a major rewrite and improved functionality across the board. It also represents the last major change I can work on (that I know of) until I receive the NES hardware, or HiROM/mapping support is implemented in the firmware. If I get bored, I'll start moving towards native UI dependency-free cross-platform support.<br /><br /><s>https://www.dropbox.com/s/xzwq4pl4d81jld8/Release_9.zip</s> (02-24-14)<br /> - <strong><em><span style="text-decoration: underline"><span style="color: #FF8000">THIS UPDATE CONTAINS A NEW FIRMWARE IMAGE, REQUIRED TO ACCESS NEW FEATURES. USERS MUST UPDATE.</span></span></em></strong> Good news is, still no loss of backward-compatibility.<br /> - Small, but good update. I tried my hand at modding the firmware again (because I was bored, sorry if this steps on your toes INL!) and modified the SNES write section to support 512-byte pages, thus halving the page count and fixing the 8MByte write issue. Host app now supports writes up to 16MByte...and since such a thing doesn't exist, we're good.<br /> - A few minor bugfixes with errors not releasing button locks.<br /> - Fixed divide by zero on erase/write error.<br /><br /><s>https://www.dropbox.com/s/hakputbzcb4tb5u/Release_9.5.zip</s> (03-01-14)<br /> - Squashed a few stupid bugs that I had missed. (Seriously, how did I miss that?) Threading some of that stuff wasn't tested in all cases, and I had to do dumb things when passing parameters so it broke a few things. Fixed that now.<br /> - Added hotkeys for Cart Size and Data Type. You can now operate the software (almost?) fully from the keyboard.<br /> - <span style="color: #FF0000"><strong>IMPORTANT: Selecting different tabs on the Rom Data view now ACTIVATES that ROM. This means Save buffer and Write operations will now EXCLUSIVELY use the tab you have selected.</strong></span> Don't know why you'd need to do that? Don't do that. If you know better, pick an appropriate tab.<br /> - Added ETA and Pages Per Second calculation to write operations, and timers on Erase and Write. One user reported issues with a possibly maybe damaged flash cart, and knowing the erase duration would likely make the trouble easier to diagnose. (Pages Per Second is just for your own amusement. ETA is calculated independantly. ETA also uses progressively-adaptive weighted smoothing.)<br /> - Why not Release 10? I want to implement two big features with Release 10. One is a surprise, the other is obvious. This is a tiny bugfix and tweak of existing functions, so I didn't feel like wasting my &quot;Big Number 10&quot; on that.<br /><br /><br /><s>https://www.dropbox.com/s/purkciqw2xx8abk/Release_10.zip</s> (03-03-14)<br /> - <span style="color: #FF0000">HiROM SUPPORT! This is UNTESTED on carts other than 12MByte! It should work. If it doesn't, let me know what broke. AKA, what your cart size is, what your Rom size is, etc. If you don't provide this information in a HiROM bug report, I will ignore you.</span> Presently HiROM is using an inefficient/slow method. We need better firmware support to make this work. Until then, this is what we get. I'm working on it, but felt it important to release it now. Normally I don't release things that aren't tested in at least most cases, but I don't have the 4MByte or 8MByte carts, and I'm not sure when they're coming. You are guinea pigs for this one. I'll try not to do it again.<br /> - Added SNES Region protection patches.<br /> - Bugfix in Patch Engine auto-header-detect.<br /> - Speed improvements in Patch Engine.<br /> - Windows 7 Taskbar now reports progress!<br /> - A bunch of other stuff, mostly behind-the-scenes.<br /> - I WANTED to get Read support going before I released this, but I figured HiROM was too important to delay.<br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/10kq4g6t4zcqyen/Release_11.zip">https://www.dropbox.com/s/10kq4g6t4zcqy ... ase_11.zip</a><!-- m --> (03-11-14)<br /> - <strong><em><span style="text-decoration: underline"><span style="color: #FF8000">THIS UPDATE CONTAINS A NEW FIRMWARE IMAGE, REQUIRED TO ACCESS NEW FEATURES. USERS MUST UPDATE.</span></span></em></strong> Good news is, there should still be no loss of backward-compatibility. As always, let me know if I'm wrong!<br /> - <strong>Mapped Write support.</strong> This should increase write speeds decently for Mirrored and HiROM games that are smaller than your cart size, and even more for users of large carts for HiROM and Mirrored LoROM. Should not have any effect on linear-write (AKA LoROM non-mirrored) ROMs. This one took a while to perfect, but totally worth it! (REQUIRES FIRMWARE UPDATE!)<br /> - Ability to switch write modes. Right-click Write button immediately before writing and select your preferred method. Old write is known as &quot;Linear&quot; and new write is &quot;Mapped&quot;.<br /> - Star Ocean <em>deinterleaved</em> ROM should write properly, did not have opportunity to test yet.<br /> - <strong>10-15% write speed increase in firmware.</strong> (REQUIRES FIRMWARE UPDATE!)<br />   - (AVRs suck at dividing! Coders should AVOID IT! Use Multiply-by-Reciprocal or Right-Shift if possible.)<br /> - SRAM Read support exists, but is unproven, unreliable, and cannot be tested for accuracy yet; as such, it is present but 'hidden' (barely) and you SHOULD NOT RELY ON IT. Full SRAM management is coming soon. (REQUIRES FIRMWARE UPDATE!)<br /> - Hot-plugging support. If you pull the plug on the Kazzo, the app now notices. Same goes for inserting the Kazzo. Limited testing shows that the app will not crash if this is done while writing, but it's still a stupid thing to try, so don't. (However, if you DO, let me know if it crashes and how.)<br /> - Fixed patches applied to The Best Protected SNES Game of All Time(tm) for its third-layer protection.<br /> - Fixed a stupid crash in the Patcher and a few other inconsistent function scenarios.<br /> - Misc. bug fixes, etc.<br /> - Finally, my favorite new feature; <span style="color: #00FF80">Cart Size AUTO-DETECT!</span> (REQUIRES FIRMWARE UPDATE!)<br />   - This has been tested only on recent 4MByte and 12MByte boards, but I think it should work on all boards. If this does not work (should automatically select an appropriate Cart Size in the dropdown when you start the app, connect the Kazzo, or load a ROM) please let me know! I'll ask you for more details in a follow-up PM, and we'll make this work for everyone.<br /> - Firmware is provided, as always, in the Firmware directory.<br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/vtb6tgenwxeqgr9/Release_11.5.zip">https://www.dropbox.com/s/vtb6tgenwxeqg ... e_11.5.zip</a><!-- m --> (03-29-14)<br /> - <span style="color: #40FF80">Temporary release</span><br /> - Re-enabled all test menus. Right-click Find Kazzo to use them. HiROM reading is known to not work in some cases.<br /> - Minor tweaks and bugfixes<br /> - Started work on XML-based matching for Patch Engine, very incomplete. Ignore the new .xml file that's created.<br /> - Unfinished release. I've been working on firmware recently, and have made some rather major improvements along those lines, but it's not ready for public release yet.<br /> - <span style="color: #40FF80">Includes signed Windows drivers.</span> I haven't tested these on other systems, it could be that they need to be signed per-computer but I'm pretty sure they'll work for everyone. Worked perfectly first time on my Win8 machine without any messing about. There's no real reason to use these over the ones you may already have, unless you're having issues.<br /><br /><br /><span style="color: #FF0000">I suppose I should add a note that this uses .Net 4.5 Framework</span> and is targeted at x86 CPUs. It's developed and tested on x64 too, so don't worry about that. If you get a crash on launch, install .Net 4.5 to fix it. I don't care if it's already installed, that's the fix. (At least, it has been every single time it's happened so far.)<br /><br /><br />QUICK USAGE: In most cases, usage is as follows:<br />0) <span style="color: #00FF80">Prep</span> your Kazzo. AKA, make sure the cart is in right. This is deceptive - in the Kazzo, the chips should face the USB cable. In the SNES, they should face AWAY from the front.<br />0a) The cart socket is not perfect. If you get errors with erase/write/etc make sure it's properly centered. I like to use the middle of the cart as a reference - if the socket's pins line up with the cart's pads in the middle, you should be fine.<br />1) <span style="color: #00FF80">Load</span> the ROM you wish to write.<br />1a) Optionally, you can turn on Auto-Mirroring, turn off Auto-Fix Protection, enable/use the Patcher, or disable Auto-Erase.<br />1B) Optionally, you can control which Rom buffer is used by selecting it from the tabs on the right. Only loaded/valid buffers will write successfully, of course. You can use this to reverse and override the Header Strip, Patching, Mirroring, or Re-Addressing functions.<br />2) Select your <span style="color: #00FF80">Cart Size</span> from the drop-down. <span style="color: #00FF80">No longer required on Release 11 with updated firmware!</span><br />3) <span style="color: #FF0000"><strong><em><span style="text-decoration: underline">VERIFY</span></em></strong> THAT THE ROM DATA IS LISTED, AND NOT 'INVALID'.</span> Seriously, it's there for a reason.<br />3a) <span style="color: #FF0000">If you change tabs on the ROM Buffers window, make sure you select the one you want to write.</span> If you don't know, select either Original, HeaderStrip, or Re-Addressed - whichever is valid. If you don't change it, it'll be unless there's something wrong. Trust me.<br />5) Click <span style="color: #00FF80">Write</span>.<br />6) <span style="color: #00FF80">Wait</span>. Grab a snack. Whatever you want to do, man. There's an ETA during Write, so you know how elaborate your snack should be. ;)<br />7) Pop it in and <span style="color: #00FF80">Play</span>.<br /><br /><br /><br /><strong><em><span style="text-decoration: underline">PLEASE SEE THE KNOWN ISSUES AND SPECIAL-CASE NOTES IN THE SECOND POST BELOW.</span></em></strong><br /><br /> <br />I'll move hosting off of Dropbox if I get reports of it having issues. I know they have a limit on how much can be transferred, but the app is TINY so it should be good.<br /><br /><br /><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">If you have a problem with the app, its usage, a suggestion, or a question, either post it here or PM me. I don't bite, and I'm more than happy to help with issues, so long as you communicate adequately and help me help you.</span></strong> If I have an important conversation through PM, I'll add it to this thread to make sure everyone benefits equally.<br /><br /><br />Also, please be prepared for updates to come fast for the first short while here. I'll keep it down to important updates for large issues or large features only, but I'm working very quickly at present.</div>

						<div class="postbody">Okay, now...<br /><br /><strong><em><span style="text-decoration: underline">KNOWN ISSUES</span></em></strong><br />- Multi-monitor issues with showing off-screen/too large (INL)<br />  -- Low-ish priority. Complain if this is of high merit to you, I'll bump it up the list.<br /><br /> - Test Mode only: Log Window entries may be in an incorrect order and/or have incorrect icons. (Me)<br />  -- This is due to the unqueued/asynchronous manner in which events are now fired.<br />  -- LOW-priority: Fixing this would slow down all operations, and only causes bad behavior in VERY rapid-update situations, such as Test-Write, where an error is fatal and ordering is of little to no help.<br /><br /><strong><em><span style="text-decoration: underline">SPECIAL CASE ROMS</span></em></strong><br />(Obviously not guaranteed to be complete.)<br /><br />ANY ROM that shows Invalid on the ROM Buffers window<br /> - These ROMs are BAD. I don't care if they happen to work if you treat them just right, they're marked as invalid for a reason. Even a broken clock is right twice a day, as they say. I won't even try to support ROMs that are Invalid. It's not worth my time - find a good Rom. If you can't find one, ask me.<br /><br />R-Type III: The Third Lightning, Castlevania: Dracula X (Mostly FastROM/LoROM games)<br /> - Must use auto-mirroring.<br /><br />Star Ocean<br /> - The S-DD1 removal version is playable, HOWEVER, the most common version of this Rom is INTERLEAVED. I'm working on writing a routine to deinterleave it, but I can't find exact documentation on what in the world was done to interleave the thing. If you know (NO, I'm NOT looking for the patch. The patch is stupid big, and I can write a function to deinterleave it within a few dozen BYTES, rather than include a multi-MByte patch) how to deinterleave it, tell me and I'll implement it.<br /> - Find the deinterleave patch yourself or just find the deinterleaved Rom. It's floating around.<br /><br />Tales of Phantasia<br /> - The Pre-Patched (English translation) of this Rom that's provided by most download locations is INVALID. It's 6MByte (6,291,968 bytes) and typically named 'Tales of Phantasia (ENG) # SNES.smc' - DO NOT USE IT. It won't work - it'll actually cause a crash, because the program can't read its header and tries to pad/mirror/HiROM-map it anyways. There are (as of Release 10) warnings in place. Don't ignore them. Seriously.<br /> - Instead, find the Japanese Rom, find the English patch, and use IT instead. The app even has a convenient patcher built in. How handy is that?<br /><br /><br /><br /><span style="color: #40FF80"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">-= FIRMWARE REWRITE =-</span></strong></span><br /><span style="color: #FF0040"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">NOTE: All credit for hardware goes to INL.

I'm not that tacky.<br />Current progress:<br /> - SNES support is complete to reflect current state of modded INL-Kazzo firmware. It's approximately twice as fast, though. I'm getting 62 pages per second on average in test cases, whereas I got an average of 34 pages per second on the INL-Kazzo mod, and less on original.<br /> - NES support is completely NONFUNCTIONAL.

No damage will occur, but it just won't work in certain situations. Maybe all of them except the few test cases I ran. I apologize for the issues, this was built and released with insufficient testing due to some issues that have prevented me from working much (if at all) on it, but I didn't want to just disappear. Development on this firmware (and the host app) have been paused for a while, until I manage to dig myself out of this hole. I will return.</div>

I feel that when highly-beta software is open-sourced, it's not &quot;others will help&quot; but more &quot;others will fork it and do their own thing&quot;. Especially when it comes to other operating systems - they can't &quot;help me&quot; because I can't touch it. They'd have to make their own version that works on their operating system, and tell me what they changed - which might break the operating system it was designed for - and I'd have no way to test if my changes broke other operating systems again.<br /><br />It WILL be open-source - you have my guarantee on that - but not until it's in a stable, sensible state. Also, I WILL work on porting it to OSX/Linux, once I have a suitable base setup going.</div>

It makes it dead simple to compare forks and branches.</div><br /><br />I am very much using the items you mentioned, so it should be that easy. It may even &quot;just work&quot; on non-Windows environments depending on the status of their Mono and Windows.Forms implementation. libUsbDotNet has a separate section of its library for Mono versus Windows so it may not be quite click-and-go.<br /><br />However, I still cannot implement even minor changes for an OS I don't have available to test with, and my previous reasons for not open-sourcing at this juncture stand. Github and Bitbucket are useless for one-person collaboration. (I say one-person collaboration because while I'm working hand-in-hand with INL, he has expressed no interest in directly coding on the host app, and prefers to stick to firmware - I am certainly not trying to slight him, or undervalue his end of it. Without his efforts, there is very little more I can do on my end, and without his help up to here, this project never would have gotten started.)<br /><br />I appreciate your input, but the project WILL NOT be open-sourced at this point in its development. I greatly value open source, and cross-platform equally so - that's why I chose the language I did, and kept the same library for the communication core. Those of you not on Windows will not be forgotten or ignored, but I'm uninterested in discussing it further at this point.<br /><br />I had considered delaying release until a time that I was prepared to address concerns like this, but I felt there was greater value in refining it further, and allowing those who could use it access just that much sooner. For now, I rather want to focus on improving and expanding it. Let's move on from cross-platform and open-source - for now. It won't be long before I'm ready to address this topic.</div>

Regardless, I want to focus on other things right now.

Earthbound/Mother 2 will be a mother-fornicator to get working because it also periodically checks whether the copier detection has been patched out.</div><br />Since this is my first actual comment that relates to something I haven't expressed a direct desire not to discuss, I'm going to give it some special attention.<br /><br />The hardware doesn't support automatic limitation to below a certain amount right now, nor RAM-mirroring. I hear INL's new carts will support it better, but as of right now that leaves the previous-gen users out unless they want to solder a row of DIP switches to the top of the cart. I'm working on software-patching these issues, in the mean time.<br /><br />For example, both SMAS and SMAS+SMW write to memory that should be mirrored and reads back a different mirror, locking you out if it's not the same value AKA has too much memory. I fix that by patching the read and compare opcodes to access the same address. So far as I can see, that address is not used for gameplay, so it doesn't matter which address you pick. For what it's worth, each of them has this check in two pairs near eachother 1+&lt;the number of games&gt; times, and all instances in both games can be caught by the same pattern. If someone expresses interest, I can disclose this information.<br /><br />DKC2 copies a string to a location in memory if it detects too much RAM or some such other issue, I fix that by copying the &quot;everything is okay&quot; type string over the &quot;i am a hacked copy&quot; type string, so it can't tell. <br /><br />As for Earthbound, my intention is to patch out the protection, then see what they're expecting for a checksum, see how they calculate it, and where they store the expected checksum, and patch that as well. It's not difficult, I just need to get around to it. My SNES disassembly skills are poor, but I doubt I'll hear anyone suggesting I don't bother with it at all.<br /><br />I'm sure there are other games out there that do these sorts of things, so if anyone knows exactly how they work - as in, &quot;look for a write to memory address X followed by a read at memory address Y and a jump statement to Q&quot; - please let me know, and I'll patch that too.</div>

This one represents a HUGE overhaul in code, adding Threading, asynchronous events, the beginnings of NES support (mostly internal/structural right now) and a huge quantity of minor updates, changes, and patches to streamline and simplify code. No known regressions, just that log window updates will be out-of-order during high-speed Test operations (IE; Test-Write) and as such, I don't care enough to fix it right now, especially since it would slow down all operations just a fraction.<br /><br />(02-24-14, Release 9)  And another update.

I hope you can fix it :D</div><br /><br />Adorable. Well, if you can post the .xml and .txt files someplace for me that might help. I haven't had any issues on my test machines, but there's no way for me to cover <em>every</em> test case reliably - that's why it's a Beta. I apologize for the issues, but I'll get right on a fix if you can provide me with that info. More info would be nice as well - what OS you're on, wether it's 32- or 64-bit, processor info, etc.. Get me that info and I'll do my best to have a fix released tonight.</div>
