I like that you are aiming to take a unique conceptual approach to the genre. I worry though, that in the choice of the battle sequence, you may have put concept ahead of gameplay in a manner that would detract from the enjoyment of the game as a whole. I would suggest, at least trying, to consider the battle sequence from an opposite perspective. Start with the idea in your head of an existing RPG battle system that you enjoy, then think of ways to make it more fun. Then, after you've come up with a fun gameplay concept, consider how to adapt it to your story concept. That's the approach I would be likely to take.

The tattooing aspect of this game appeals to me, not because I'm particularly interested in tattoos but because I'm interested in games that are unique and stretch what's expected in a game.

That would be a lot less likely to push me away as a gamer.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I like the concept. Actually a while ago I spent some time thinking about what it would be like to have a tattoo artist game for Wii U or DS where you could use the stylus to draw on the screen.<br /><br />As far as gameplay goes, I don't really like the look of the tattoo drawing stuff in that video, but I didn't presume it was much more than temporary. There are lots of ways you could make playing a tattoo interesting.<br /><br />One idea might be to have the path of the needle automated, and the player needs to press buttons and directions at well timed positions along the path. Maybe like guitaroo man where you have to follow a direction and press buttons in time with the music. Just thinking that having the player bound to the path of the tattoo might bypass the (intractable?) problem of following curved lines with a dpad.

I really need to post a test ROM.<br /><br />edit : typo
