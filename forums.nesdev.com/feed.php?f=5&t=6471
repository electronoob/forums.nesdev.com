I agree, it's a great game. I have played it for 3-4 hours and I must say the difficulty is very well balanced. The graphics, level design and story/character design are great. Music could be better IMO, but it's still very good.<br /><br />90% of messages on this thread are about cutscenes, maybe time to split? I would rather hear suggestions of good indie games. <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=80">thefox</a> — Sun Jun 06, 2010 1:34 pm</p><hr />

Well, well just wanted to point something :<br />I don't know how many of you know about the GBA Mega Man Battle Network series, it's basically RPG Mega Man games. There is 6 of them, and it's pretty obvious the game engine has been completely revised between 3 and 4 (I'm talking about overworld game engine, not battles which are similar in all 6 games). This makes 1-3 use game engine A, and 4-6 uses game engine B.<br /><br />1-3 have skippable cut-scenes, and 4-6 have non-skippable cut-scenes.<br />Because the story of the games is kind of significant, you'd want to watch the scene at least once. However, like in the NES Mega Man games, the bosses needs quite some strategy to be beaten and it's very unlikely you'll success on your first try. This is why it's really annoying to have non-skippable cutscenes in 4-6 : You're forced to watch the scenes before the boss again and again.<br /><br />HOWEVER, I found myself skipping important scenes in MMBN1-3 by pressing a button by accident, which to be honest just as annoying. I'm not saying cut-scenes should be unskippable, but they shouldn't be too easily skippable. The best is : Player press "start", then the game go to a screen where it brings a menu like "skip - resmue - rewind". That way everyone is happy. Rare are games who actually does this tough, Final Fantasy 12 is one of them, but the story line of this game is in my opinion pure crap (very unlike all it's predecessor) so well... at least you can skip the crap.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"><br />I will say, however, that everyone I know IRL cares very little for in game cutscenes and just want to play the game. I think only the hardcore gamer nerds (no offense) really care, and these days that makes up a rather small percentage of all gamers.<br /></div><br />You aren't the great majority of gamers, nor am I or anyone else here. If you include all granddads who play Wii sport, Nintendogs and all this crap in the majority of gamers, then you're probably right. However, I wouldn't consider them gamers.<br />You'd be surprised that many casual gamers actually play RPGs almost only for their story and the easier the game is, the better for them. I have my sis in mind here (okay she's not the majority of gamers either), and to be honnest I don't quite understand what is the point of playing if you don't care about the gameplay.<br /><br />However, it's not because most of you play NES games all day, and that NES games never have any cutscenes (exept Ninja Gaiden) that cutscenes are bad. They aren't necessary for a good game (we all know SMB, etc...), but honnestly a good story and good/fun scenes really makes a game very supperior to the average (see the FF series).<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=38">Bregalad</a> — Sun Jun 06, 2010 12:02 pm</p><hr />

I'm not trying to advocate that no scenes should be skippable, I'm against the idea that developers need to then go a step further and make sure the player doesn't miss anything despite his conscious decision to miss something.<br /><br />I mean, that's what I said from the beginning:<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"><br />Cutscenes should be skippable but that doesn't mean they need to also be irrelevant to playing the game itself.<br /></div><br /><br />I thought that's what the argument was about.

For what it's worth, I'm in agreement with Disch here.  Making cutscenes or drama-scenes (think Ninja Gaiden) skippable is more or less a requirement.  If the player/user wants to skip said scenes, they'll press a button/whatever.  If they don't, that's their choice too.  If the scene in question is actually a training sequence and they skip it, so what -- it's their own fault/demise.<br /><br />The modus operandi for not permitting cutscene skipping seems to be either paranoia or vengeance; I can't tell which.<br /><br />Do you know how many NES and SNES games I've played where I've skipped tutorials, cut-scenes, etc. simply to get back to the gameplay -- instead referring to the user manual for details?  Many.  :-)<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3">koitsu</a> — Sun Jun 06, 2010 8:50 am</p><hr />

Just wanna state that I'm all the way with Disch on this one.<br /><br />You know, even when cutscenes are DA SHIT, perfect in every possible way, I will still most likely only want to watch them the first couple of times I play through the game. They should always be skippable.<br /><br />I also believe that games should be self-contained products. I shouldn't need a manual or any info besides what's on the cartridge/CD/other media in order to play it... You see, these things may get lost with time, pausing the game to look stuff up somewhere else is not convenient at all, and so on. I would most likely get frustrated with a game like that and move on without thinking twice.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=95">tokumaru</a> — Sun Jun 06, 2010 8:15 am</p><hr />

The Galaxy games give you a quick flyby of the level as you first enter it, showing you the layout and potentially the location of hidden items.

They've got signs and NPCs everywhere explaining things you need to do; it doesn't make them a bad designer if I find this immersion-breaking.

I love the gameplay in Cave Story.  It's tons of fun.<br /><br />The problem with it is that the cutscenes are not skippable.  I've seen them all several times.  I can't play the game anymore because I find it tiresome to repeatedly tap the action button and wait for those scenes to end.  It's a <em>serious</em> replay killer, and a <em>serious</em> flaw in the game.<br /><br />There is absolutely no reason those cutscenes shouldn't have been skippable.  It was a terrible design decision to make them nonskippable.<br /><br />Same is true of every game.  That was my original claim, and my original point.  I stand by that.<br /><br />If you like the cutscenes, watch them.  If you don't, it costs <em>absolutly nothing</em> to let the player skip them.  So let them skip them if they choose.  If it means more people will enjoy the game, it's a good thing.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"><br />No game developer attempts to make a game that absolutely everyone will enjoy<br /></div><br /><br />Of course.  I said as much in an earlier post.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"><br />Konami makes long, drawn out, highly complicated cutscenes in Metal Gear because they know their target audience wants that.<br /></div><br /><br />And they'd be wrong if they didn't make their cut scenes skippable.<br /><br />All the people that like Metal Gear would still like it.  But those people that find cutscenes boring would also like it more.  Everyone wins when they're skippable.  There's no reason not to put it in every game.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=33">Disch</a> — Sat Jun 05, 2010 8:13 pm</p><hr />

Poor is a relative term.<br /><br />I have the same lack of remorse for players who don't read the manual and get upset when they don't know how to jump, or who skip the "boring tutorial" and get upset when they don't know how to equip an item...or those who don't watch a scene that gives them vital information.<br /><br />In short, the player has responsibility to absorb the information I give him if he wants to enjoy my game.  I'm not a bad designer if he refuses my help.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"><br />Watching cutscenes is not fun for a lot of people.  Especially if they've already played through the game a few times.<br /></div><br /><br />And watching scenes is the primary reason some people play video games.  Everyone has their own tastes, and it's up to the consumer to buy games that match theirs.<br /><br />If you only like football games you shouldn't buy an RPG.  If you don't like twitch games with precise movement you shouldn't buy a shooter.  And if you don't like watching cutscenes then you shouldn't buy a cinematic, story-heavy game.<br /><br />No game developer attempts to make a game that absolutely everyone will enjoy, because the game often ends up a mess that nobody likes, mediocre in all aspects.  A good developer knows their specific target audience and makes a game tailored to them.  Nippon Ichi doesn't try to put twitch platforming in their strategy RPGs because they know their target audience doesn't want that.  Konami makes long, drawn out, highly complicated cutscenes in Metal Gear because they know their target audience wants that.  Either way, it's primarily your own fault for not researching the type of game if you buy it and end up not liking it.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"><br />So yeah.  If your game is no fun, then you're right.  They should be playing a different game.  And they probably will.<br /></div><br />"No fun" being a relative term, I would hope so!  I don't want someone writing me a nasty letter saying "yo dawg I just wanted to play some Madden but your RPG doesn't have any playbooks and I can't tackle, therefore your game sucks."<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"><br />If the cutscene is 2 seconds and says "do this" that's one thing.<br /><br />If the cutscene is 5 minutes of crap you don't care about with 2 seconds of important info buried in the middle of it, that sucks.<br /></div><br />Hey, relative again.  Don't play the games if you think they suck, meanwhile the throng of players who do care to watch the scenes and learn secrets from them will be over here enjoying it.<br /><br />It's the same complaint from the people who don't talk to every NPC in an RPG and get lost - they think they should be able to complete the game without talking to anyone.  This is the wrong genre for that person.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"><br />If the player asks "what am I supposed to be doing in this game now?" and the game says "tough shit, you should've watched that 5 minute cutscene at the start of the level", then that's a crappy game.<br /></div><br />Again: nope.<br /><br />You used the example of restaurants.  Here's another way to put what you're saying to me:<br /><br />If the customer asks "can I buy prime rib here?" and the restaurant says "tough shit, this is a Taco Bell," then that's a crappy restaurant.<br /><br />What I'm saying is the customer needs to pay more attention at what's being offered when they first pull into the drive through.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3438">UncleSporky</a> — Sat Jun 05, 2010 7:48 pm</p><hr />

Perhaps you can have your 2 minute cutscene, but break it up into three parts: the first minute and a half (FFing allowed), the 10 seconds that are important (no FFing unless this specific cutscene has been shown since power-on), and then the 20 second transition into gameplay (FFing allowed).<br /></div><br /><br />I guess that would be an improvement, but it seems like roundabout way to make a poor design more tolerable.<br /><br />It's better if you just don't bury useful information inside something people are going to skip.<br /><br />How often is this even the case, anyway?  The only game I can remember that had important info in a cutscene was the "look at my ass" scene in Metal Gear Solid, and even that wasn't very important because you're likely to figure it out when you got spotted and the guard ran away laughing instead of shooting at you.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"><br />I take it you're not a fan of fast food with its self-service soda fountain.<br /></div><br /><br />You get what you pay for.

RTFM if you don't understand the core game mechanics.<br /><br />A clever game designer will put a "how to play" or "tutorial" option on the main menu to explain the rules of the game if they aren't immediately clear... rather than automatically show a cutscene the user is likely to skip.<br /><br />They can choose to see the tutorial or choose not to.  But they'll know it's there, and if they can't figure out the game mechanics on their own, they'll give it a look.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=33">Disch</a> — Sat Jun 05, 2010 6:09 pm</p><hr />

In this game, most presses of the A button will result in damage to the player; get damaged three times in one round and your game is over. You have to find pieces that are eligible for clearing, or make them so by dragging and dropping them into place, before you line up on top of a piece and press A. But only the opening cutscene (which is skippable if it has been played at least once on that cartridge and replayable from the main menu) explains this.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=9">tepples</a> — Sat Jun 05, 2010 3:58 pm</p><hr />
