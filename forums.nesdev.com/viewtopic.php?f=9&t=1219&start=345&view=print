If the algorithm is indeed the same, however, I can reverse-engineer the keys if I am given a log of the communications between the lock and key (as I have for the regional CICs).  Has anyone ever logged the SNES CIC's communication?

<br />The only solution, in this case, would be to restart everything again, but with NES (or SNES) CIC (as they share the same hardware, but not the same data).
<br />And, what makes it harder, is that tengen chip was reversed quickly after a "debug mode" was found, and not using microscope pictures.
<br />Am I right so far?

I think someone was going to make ROM dumps for the international CIC variants - has that ever happened?  If such dumps exist, I wouldn't mind doing some comparisons against the 3193 dump, which would help figure out the bit organization.
<br />
<br />Even then, it would by no means be an easy task to figure out the instruction set, as we have no info on the real CIC's technical capabilities.  Knowing the algorithm definitely helps, though, and it wouldn't surprise me at all if it can eventually be accomplished.

<br />1. the clock divider is by 4 right? 4mhz/4 so 1mhz?
<br />    and what speed is the input/output data?
<br />
<br />2. i see seeds for 3195, 3196 and 3197 what about 3193 3198?
<br />    and the "X" can that nibble be anything? is it a mistake in 10NES?
<br />
<br />3. does anyone have a copy of the real CIC binary?
<br />    i wouldn't mind seeing it <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />

<br />1. The Tengen chip executes 1 instruction every 4 clock cycles, so yes, the instruction execution speed is 1 MHz.  It is assumed that the original CIC also works this way, but I don't know if it was ever verified.
<br />
<br />As for the I/O, that is controlled by the code.  The Tengen ROM was translated to C, so you can check out how it works (including timing) here:
<br />
<br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://thefox.aspekt.fi/Tengen.c">http://thefox.aspekt.fi/Tengen.c</a><!-- m -->
<br />
<br />2. The 3193's seed (if I'm reading the Tengen code right - I don't have it in my notes) is as follows:
<br />
<br />LOCK: 3952F20F9109997
<br />KEY: x952129F910DF97
<br />
<br />The "x" can be any 4-bit value.  At the start of execution, the chip inside the NES randomly picks a value and sends it to the chip inside the cartridge.  Note that you need to do some math on the transmitted value in order to determine what to use for "x" (see the Tengen source linked above).
<br />
<br />The 3198 has not been reverse-engineered.  That chip only appears in the Famicombox, and it appears to operate differently from the CIC's used in the NES.
<br />
<br />3. The ROM data, as it appears under a microscope, can be seen here:
<br />
<br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.nesmuseum.com/10nes/nescicrom.txt">http://www.nesmuseum.com/10nes/nescicrom.txt</a><!-- m -->
<br />
<br />The bits are interleaved, but we don't know how they are arranged.

<br />if the SNES and NES use the same chip with a different code the bits should be in the same order
<br />think I'll look into the NES CIC some more Tengen said they had there chip working before they even had the copyright documents <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />
<br />so i wonder if they found out the order of the bits or some how cracked the I/O
<br />I'm thinking they most likely found out the order....

The PPU also returned a specific value in the unused bits of $2002, which games would check in order to verify they were working on the right hardware.  Also, I think some games switched around the controller configurations as well, which would've caused confusion if the wrong game was played on the wrong system.  I'm not an arcade expert, though, so I may not remember very accurately.
