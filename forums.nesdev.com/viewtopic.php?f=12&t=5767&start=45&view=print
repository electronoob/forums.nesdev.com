<br />
<br />haha I'd put artefacted anime videos way above any youtube poop =).  I think DKC series used the 16 palettes and 4bpp tiles to get its very colourful overworld images drawn, it looked pretty decent.  If there was any pressure to cut down on ROM size it'd be alot more appealing.
<br />
<br />I have a video ROM <a href="http://smkdan.eludevisibility.org/vid7.7z" class="postlink">here</a> but it has some issues:
<br />-I still haven't made the audio code less shit, although there's no pressure in terms of frame time
<br />-no compression, I just wanted to get something working before involving all of that.  It won't be hard to add it into the current source.
<br />-it uses the frames from the mov, not the divx you just posted there.  You want the video to have the entire intro from the divx, with the JP audio delayed until it syncs with the JP vid? I mean, should there be silence for the first few moments?
<br />
<br />Matthew if you don't want me putting these on your server just say so, I don't mind uploading big videos even with the horrors of *Australian Internet* but I don't know about you.
<br />
<br />7zip 'ultra' compression got the video down to 43MB, I wonder how the S-DD1 will measure up to that.

<br />
<br />Given the way compression works, I'm sure the SFC file will be smaller, but once compressed with 7-zip, that file will likely be even bigger. S-DD1 is nowhere near as good as 7-zip, even though it's optimized for tiledata. Once it's applied, 7-zip won't be able to find patterns anymore.
<br />
<br />I still think it's worth using. Smaller ROMs load in emulators faster, and it looks more impressive from a technical standpoint. Either way though, it looks like we have plenty of space left.

<br />
<br /> You can also interlace (not to be confused with an interlaced TV output) the tilemap with HDMA to break the 15 colors per tile limit. This'll add a little overhead for uploading more palette associations for multiple tilemaps, but the trade off is worth it. You can do palette association for 8x4, or 8x2 , etc pseudo tiles. 4bit tiles are half the bandwidth for transferring to vram, half the storage space too in rom too. 
<br />
<br /> Side note: I couldn't get that last rom to work in bsnes <img src="./images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" alt=":(" title="Sad" /> Shows about second or so of video, then shows junk onscreen.

I made it drop frames to fit the 30hz-&gt;20hz conversion (in my batch converter not the SNES code) but it is just as fluid as the mov.  It stutters in media players too, there's no smoothness, take any section with scrolling and its so apparent.  Then I see the low quality youtube one posted earlier and it's so smooth.  The part where they scroll through all those characters stutters pretty badly in every movie file I've seen except the youtube, but ofcourse the youtube one has extremely shit quality at the same time.  What a tease haha.

<br />Any suggestions on what to do?  Time with the screen disabled is limited though, thanks to having to double buffer a pair of 38KB frames with less than 64KB of VRAM.  If missed something just say so, was late when I actually made the thing work.  There's plenty of nothing happening during the active display time, the audio code runs, the pointer setup code runs, then it does nothing for quite a while.

<br />Does anyone know where to get a higher quality version of this video?

<br />
<br />If you already have 32KHz stereo output, not sure. Maybe push for 30fps? :P
<br />Bandwidth calculations tell me it's not possible though. Plus our sources for this particular video are too low framerate. It'd be a waste.
<br />
<br />You may want to show off the power better by picking a video you like that we have in actual high quality, 60fps action. It would also be fun to utilize all 256MB, which would mean using a really long video and sending Matthew several thank you cards in the mail in advance :)

<br />
<br />You can see that that opening sequence was made by a professional animation studio, probably at 24 fps because that's what anime usually is. Then the software company just chopped it down to 15 fps without much care, this is why it looks choppy.
<br />
<br />This is usually true for any Saturn/PSX game that has <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Df2aiNeFU84" class="postlink">anime sequences at 15 fps</a>.

<br />This appears to have gone through a video filter to make it smoother (a filter that VirtualDub has), but it looks a bit overdone. If it's applied not so heavily on the video above it might make it a bit better.
<br />
<br />EDIT: I just checked the high quality video again and it's actually 30 fps, but it doesn't look very smooth because it was poorly converted from 24 fps. This means that every 5th frame is the video is a duplicate of the 4th, and this kills all the smoothness. If someone is able (I failed very hard at getting VirtualDub to open the mp4 file) to get rid of the repeated frames they'd probably get a very smooth 24 fps video, which could be properly converted back to 30 fps.

<br />
<br />edit: for the time being, I am using the DivX video.  It definitely has alot less artefacts than the mov one and is a bit smoother.  I had to use dithering in irfan view because otherwise the color banding was absolutely fucking killer, although I think it looks prettier than the 64MB one I uploaded.
<br />
<br />I only recently modified andreas compressor to work when my batch converter invokes it.  I'll feed it compressed streams whenever it crosses a 1MB bank boundary, since you said S-DD1 can read properly between 64KB boundaries right? Even 1MB boundaries? After crossing a 1MB bank of data, it'll reconfigure $4806 and $4807, setup another DMA source address, then keep doing fixed address reads from said address.  Should be just fine if my knowledge of the chip is in check.  Will probably get a start tomorrow.
<br />
<br />edit2: I should've posted the divx example ROM.  Out of sync audio and unecessary bits at the start, but you can atleast watch for the quality, let me know what you think.  There are glitches on the sides of the borders with very bright colors in view but that's just because I wrote the wrong value to $2131 and I don't feel like uploading another 80MB ROM just for that =)

<br />
<br />Wow, major major improvement to quality indeed. Really the only place I even notice an issue is that left-to-right panning scene. I'm honestly very happy with the file as-is. And in fact, I almost don't mind keeping that short Game Arts intro, it's kind of funny and makes it look like the actual Saturn game :D
<br />
<br />I'd say if its no trouble to just pad empty audio onto the start of the PCM stream, or just mirror the video's audio source. Whatever's best.
<br />
<br />This is just gorgeous, it really shows off that the SNES really can be a first-class citizen even in terms of full motion video and near-CD-quality audio. Its biggest caveat was the extremely expensive (at the time) ROM data.
<br />
<br />Thanks to this example ROM, perhaps we can encourage one of the flash cart makers to support such a mapper; or at least get some demo coders to create enhancements like this for existing games.

<br />
<br />It can definitely cross 64KB boundaries. To be sure, I modified the emulator to log transfers. If the real game does it, you can be confident that you can too. And it does:
<br />
<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">printf&#40;&quot;* S-DD1: %.6x : %.4x &#91;%u&#93;\n&quot;, addr, buffer.size, &#40;addr &amp; 0xff0000&#41; != &#40;&#40;addr + buffer.size&#41; &amp; 0xff0000&#41;&#41;;<br />sdd1emu.decompress&#40;addr, buffer.size, buffer.data&#41;;</div><br /><br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">* S-DD1: ffd0ab : 0824 &#91;0&#93;<br />* S-DD1: fed27f : 1800 &#91;0&#93;<br />* S-DD1: de84ac : 0300 &#91;0&#93;<br />* S-DD1: de9af5 : 0380 &#91;0&#93;<br />* S-DD1: d4f159 : 8000 &#91;1&#93;<br />* S-DD1: daf458 : 1c00 &#91;1&#93;<br />* S-DD1: dbe8ed : 0800 &#91;0&#93;<br />* S-DD1: dce0e8 : 1080 &#91;0&#93;<br />* S-DD1: ddc615 : 04e0 &#91;0&#93;</div>
<br />
<br />Just from the start, it crosses a 64KB boundary fairly quickly.
<br />
<br />The only reason it wouldn't be able to cross a 1MB ROM boundary is if the chip internally uses a 20-bit address register. That would be rather stupid.
<br />
<br />I can't 100% verify it since the two S-DD1 games out there don't actually transfer across a 1MB boundary. Given that you have to change banks anyway, you may as well play it safe and assume the chip can only transfer within the current 1MB mapped block.
<br />
<br />You probably already have code to detect bank crossing that splits the DMA into two partial transfers, so it shouldn't require any changes unless you're mapping 4MB at a time and streaming to the end. In that case, modify it to only use MMC3:$f00000-$ffffff and we'll be certain the hardware was capable of that.
<br />
<br />Now unfortunately, I <em>strongly</em> doubt the real S-DD1 and SPC7110 were capable of accessing more than 6/8MB for the S-DD1 and 1MB+4MB for the SPC7110. Doing so would've required more address bus pins, which would be a pointless expense just to tie them all to ground.
<br />
<br />I don't think it violates the spirit of the chips though to simply extend their addressable range. This is very different from making up an MMC + PCM streaming device from scratch.

<br />
<br /> I'm not sure I follow you. A single 8x8 4bit tiles takes 32bytes. A single tilemap entry takes 2 bytes. If he uses 4 tilemaps for an 8x2 pseudo tile, that an extra 6bytes on top of the normal 8x8 and tilemap, per 8x8 area. 38bytes per 8x8 &lt; 64bytes of 8x8 8bit tile. And if I'm not mistaken, he's already updating the 256 color palette of 8bit tile mode on every frame (unless he's using direct 332 RGB mode). Wouldn't be updating 8 subpalettes be even smaller than updating an 8bit palette? (not that it's a large amount to begin with in comparison with all the tiles being updated).
