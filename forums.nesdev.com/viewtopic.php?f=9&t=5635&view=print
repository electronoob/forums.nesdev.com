<br />NES, Mega Drive, Super NES, and the vast majority of PlayStation and Nintendo 64 games use a 240p variant of NTSC or a 288p variant of PAL. These look fine on CRT SDTVs, but HDTVs with more complicated upscalers designed only for 480i might choke. Because no spec adopted by a national TV regulator describes the progressive variants of SDTV, no TV is <em>required</em> to implement them. The upscaler engineers probably assume that only a statistically insignificant fraction of HDTV buyers held on to their pre-Dreamcast consoles.
<br />
<br />If the picture is bouncing by half a scanline, up and down at 30 Hz, that's normal on some upscalers. But if the picture is bouncing by more than that, you'll need to use an external upscaler. I have a Philips DVD recorder whose upscaler turns the NES's 240p video into 480i NTSC and 720p HDMI signals that does this for me.

<br />
<br />Actually I believe it relies on the horizontal refresh rate of the TV.  I'm pretty sure you have to manually poll the zapper on every hit-able scanline as it's being drawn.  It's actually quite precise on a single frame, vertically.  The boxes are for determining horizontal position.  I'm no CRT expert, but I've played around with the zapper before.

<br />
<br />Dunno about what chips it uses, but it is a 46" Vizio.  Would Sony matter?  I heard rumors Sony actually makes the Vizio brand, but I have no clue.  It doesn't fail on plasmas.Every thousandth time or so I test it it will give an image, but it wouldn't refresh past the first frame (title screen) and sometimes if it did even a little bit, you could see ghosting of sprites behind the background...kind of like those images in scary movies of something trying to push through a wall that's really made of latex.
