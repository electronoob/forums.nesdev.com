Hello,<br /><br />After many hours spended with reading various websites about creating ROMs for the NES, I decided I wanted to try it myself. I am VERY new to Assembler, I do have a background of creating applications in Visual Basic, C#, Pascal and C (and a few others), though.<br /><br />There are still many things that I don't understand of assembler (I seem to not understand the Carrier bit fully for example, I had some troubles with adding and subtracting values) and I think the code of my first project contain some emberassing parts. Still I finished it today and I hope I'll keep on learning (and gaining more experience and confidence in what I'm doing) from this point.<br /><br />As this is my very first Assembler and NES application, I decided to keep it VERY simple. So it's not a game. It's a little bit like a oversized "Hello world" program <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" /> . It features only static screens, no scrolling, it mainly only uses 4 colors (I wonder why <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /> ). It's a "Number Guess" program, I've written in various languages over the years. I didn't come up with the cards with the numbers myself by the way, but unfortunately I do not know who did.<br /><br />Still I had a lot of fun (and sometimes a bit of frustration...) writing this and will definitely try to come up with new ROMs in the future.<br /><br />I'll have to thank the people who are on NesDev for sharing their experience and knowledge on the forums, as this was an absolute great source for information. Also I have to thank everybody who contributed material to the main NesDev-site.<br /><br />Some last comments:<br />- I've used a crappy Visual Basic application to create the nametable files. That's why they are all 2 bytes too big.<br /><br />- I've tested it in three emulators. It seemed to work fine on Nintendulator and FCE Ultra. It did not work at all in LoopyNES though <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" alt=":(" title="Sad" /><br /><br />- English is not my native language <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />Comments, suggestions, tips would be VERY appriciated as I'd really like to learn from my errors.<br /><br />Thanks for reading!<br /><br />Best regards,<br />Vincent<p>Statistics: Posted by Guest — Mon Aug 22, 2005 1:18 pm</p><hr />
