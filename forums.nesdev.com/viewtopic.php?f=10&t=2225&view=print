		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />So I downloaded CA65, read through the documentation to get an idea of how it's used, and it sounds great. Then I went to the NES101 document and immediatley came across a whole bunch of commands that don't exist in CA65.  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_mad.gif" alt=":x" title="Mad" /> Should I just forget the tutorial and try to write a simple program on my own? Because I'm definitely planning on sticking with CA65 and it seems like following a tutorial written specifically for a different assembler ("P65" in this case) is kind of pointless. (It would be better if the tutorial explained what the commands did so you could find the corresponding command in whatever assembler you were using without having to look at the documentation and "translate" everything. Yes, I'm lazy. Plus it's not condusive to actual understanding.)
<br />
<br />Is NES101 the only reliable tutorial out there?

I'd say, for your purposes, just use P65 for the NES 101 tutorial so you can get a good feel for how the NES works, then choose whatever assembler you want to use for your own projects.

I did alot with that, but the main thing I didn't like was my sprite tiles were being eaten into by the assembler.  But I did get a feel for how to do some things for the NES.  I had a fellow Nes Devver help me setup CA65 for NES development (which I think was kind of a pain), and have been going from there.
<br />
<br />My point is pretty much what Quietust said.  Use P65 to go with the NES101 tut, then if you want to change assemblers after getting an understanding of what is going on, do so.

<br />
<br />It's not super hard, just different from usual assemblers since there is a linking stage after assembly (using LD65).
<br />
<br />In the assembly source, instead of using .ORG you use things like .segment "CODE", .segment "DATA", .segment "VECTORS", and whatever other segments you create and name.  The size and location of those are defined by your linker config.
<br />
<br />I've got an example linker config you can use here to start with (nes.cfg):
<br /><a href="http://www.parodius.com/~memblers/nes/" class="postlink">http://www.parodius.com/~memblers/nes/</a>
<br />And n.bat there shows the commands used to assemble it.  But in that example I link several different objects (.o files) together.
<br />
<br />See the docs for CA65 and LD65 for further info:
<br /><a href="http://www.cc65.org/doc/" class="postlink">http://www.cc65.org/doc/</a>

<br />Is that all there is to using LD65? It seems pretty simple. After running it you would end up with a valid .nes file?

<br />
<br />The way my linker setup works, you'll end up with just a PRG ROM, no header or CHR-ROM.  Which is appropriate for running on an NES (and I prefer to use CHR-RAM).
<br />
<br />For emulator use, I have a seperate header file that I just copy onto the ROM after assembly (it's the HEADER file (which seems to not be in that folder online there), and you see it being copied on in n.bat).  You could add an iNES header segment to the linker config though.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Thanks again memblers. I just want to make sure I understand what the batch file does:
<br />
<br />Run CA65 on the components
<br />Run LD65 on all the CA65 output files to output the file "lib", which would be playabe on the NES (along with a map file rom.map)
<br />Combine header and lib into the file "lib.nes" which is playable in an emulator
<br />
<br />Is that right? Is "header" just the iNes header after being run through ca65 by itself? Could you make a rom in a format other than iNes just by changing to a different header file?
<br />
<br />Why are the components of the program separate object files? Is that to make it quicker to use the same ones in different programs, or to make it easier to see where the mistakes are if there are any? Would using .include when you run ca65 in the first place sort of do the same thing?
<br />
<br />Also I'm not that familiar with batch files - is the line \nes\fce\fceu lib.nes a continuation of the "COPY" command line before it and mean copy the file as lib.nes to the folder nes\fce\fceu? And the REM lines would copy to other folders if you removed the REMs?
<br />
<br />(Sorry, I just want to make sure I fully understand everything as I go along so I don't get confused later. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_redface.gif" alt=":oops:" title="Embarassed" />)

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I made the header by editing it in an emulator (Nintendulator and NESticle both come to mind as emus with header editors) and cutting it off in a hex editor.  You could add any kind of header or other data (like CHR-ROM or other pre-assembled PRG banks) the same way.
<br />
<br />I'm not sure why I did it as seperate object files there, normally I just .include a source file in the main one.  Not sure if I had any advantage by doing it that way.
<br />
<br />The \nes\fce\fceu lib.nes line is a seperate command, it runs the emulator and loads the ROM from the current directory.  And yeah, the REM lines are just lines that are commented out.

For such formats, you'll want to assemble separate PRG and CHR files and then run them through the format's builder.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">Why are the components of the program separate object files?

The GNU tool called <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/make/" class="postlink">Make</a> automates this, and there are a whole bunch of frontends for making "makefiles", or scripts for Make.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">Would using .include when you run ca65 in the first place sort of do the same thing?</div>
<br />Using .include to bring in code or data tables makes compilation take longer and runs the risk of bringing in a piece of code twice.

<br />With iNES format or NES 2.0 format, you can write the header into a segment of the assembly language program. But with other formats, you won't be as lucky.
