I haven't had any problems with MMC3 games once I started using this combination, but a few games (i.e. Kirby's Adventure) required me to up the rom size using the d21 notation. (i.e. d21 would double the prog rom dumping size, but dump the &quot;default&quot; size for the chr rom).

I guess the problem is I am trying to script the whole process of dumping NES ROMs since I have over a 100 games to try to dump. I was opening them in an emulator to see if the ROM is good but now I can compare the crc32 to that database. <br /><br />I switched to the command line script in the &quot;062_GUI&quot; version and used the mmc3.ag script like you suggested and got a good dump of TMNT2 however TMNT3 is still giving me some trouble even with the mmc3_v2.ad script. I'll have to see if I can give it a good cleaning or if the cartridge even works anymore on a NES

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />So I've succeeded in dumping every game I own save two: Twinbee and Faxanadu.<br /><br />For Twinbee, I already have a way forward as suggested on the previous page. I will be trying that tomorrow.  I did have problems with Kid Icarus, but that worked fine after I opened up the cartridge shell and gave it a better cleaning. <br /><br />However, Faxanadu seems to thwart me at every turn. I opened it up, and the contacts look VERY clean. Attempting to clean them more doesn't even pick up anything on the Q-tip. However, the game keeps dumping with a different CRC every time, which makes me believe it's still not making proper contact. Potentially the contacts are just worn-down and aren't as thick as they should be? Any suggestions for improving the situation long enough to get a good dump?

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Is it sensing CHR-RAM with faxanandu?  If the cart is very heavily worn to the point where the PCB has narrowed lengthwise significantly it's conceivable that pushing the circuit board to the far right (side of the USB connector) would provide better success.  I've never seen one worn that heavily though.  Really your most likely issue is dirty/poor connection.  Does the game play well in your NES?

I'm not really sure what happened here, except perhaps I didn't end up switching banks, so the tool thought I just had the same thing repeated over and over.<br /><br />I'll give it another go tomorrow. Of course, even when it dumps, I need to find a tool to convert it to UNIF format, or cook something up in Python.

This should work, but for some reason (bug in the software/firmware?) it doesn't.  There are several oddities like this that prevent things from working as you'd think they should.  Could there be other things like that causing issues?  Who knows... That's where I got the motivation to drop development on kazzo-anago/unagi scripts and just create my own firmware/software from the ground up.

Ground can't get much bigger as the entire board has poured ground plane on both sides.<br /><br />    <div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">A 100 nF bypass cap for each +5V pin on each IC.</div>I've always used 1nF which is what I understood as the standard.  The kazzo only has one, I don't see much point in giving the flipflops their own.  Maybe that's not the rule, but I all three chips are in close proximity to the caps and I've yet to see an issue.  My INL-ROM v2 boards do have a cap per chip for most configs, although the CIC and CHR are close enough I have them share.  Depending on the config, there are other places caps are shared.  For those spots, if caps weren't shared I'd litterally end up with two caps sitting right next to eachother in which case it wouldn't be a gain anyways.<br /><br />    <div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">A 10 µF cap close to where power enters the board.</div> It can't get much closer to the entrance on the kazzo.  INL-ROM boards have it on the left and similar location as the original boards.  Moving it closer to the bottom would also move it away from the regulator.  v2 boards it's really only an inch away.  Although if you're talking about that kazzo board I made years ago, I'd agree with you.<br /><br />    <div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">Less spaghetti routing, more thought into how to &quot;bus things real nice and neat&quot;. </div>Why?  That would be a deal breaker for many things I make as I see it.  And I fail to see the benefit.  The kazzo is 'bussed' to some degree where the routing was easy.  Bussing on INL-ROM boards would mean more expensive boards, and less mapper/board options for a given board.  Looking at original NES boards it's hard for me to consider them 'bussed' nice and neat.  Either way I still don't see the benefit or gain in reliability.  Although now I look at your link and you're linking to my original kazzo which I made 3 years ago now.  I thought you were talking about my current boards.  The current version isn't auto-routed like that one was, to some degree it's more 'bussed' and is nice and neat as I see it.  IMO the auto routing is more messy unpreferred.  That board was the first and last PCB I ever auto-routed aside from a prototype one off.  Perhaps the comments about noise cap were in reference to those old boards as well.  Not sure why I didn't put them on that one...  It'd be easy to add one to the original since it was through hole.  It's on the current version.  <br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">Just a bit of constructive criticism to help with the next HW revision before the INL-ROM v2 comes out.</div>I've started shipping them in place of v1 boards with flash upgrades for people interested in them.<br /><br />Realizing that the comments might have been all about that initial kazzo board I made which was my first PCB ever, I agree with all points actually.  Aside from the fact that image was pre-ground pouring. The discussion of my other boards made me think the comments were directed to all my boards.<br /><br />Here's a trace shot of my 'final' version with the SNES connector and everything handrouted and such.<br /><img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/18341918/kazzo_INLretro_pgmr.jpg" alt="Image" />

But I guess that when they're real thin, they start picking up noise, and there's resistance to getting the power out of the 22 uF. That's what the 100 nF next to each Vcc pin is for.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">I don't see much point in giving the flipflops their own.</div><br />Yeah, you can probably get away with sharing a cap among simple chips that are close together. At least Nintendo appears to have done so on cart boards. I plan to ask about 1 nF vs. 100 nF bypass caps.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">Although if you're talking about that kazzo board I made years ago, I'd agree with you.</div><br />And now I realize you've improved this in newer revisions.
