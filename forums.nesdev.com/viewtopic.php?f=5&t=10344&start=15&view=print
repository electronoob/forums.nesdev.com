Introducing &gt;= ~3 PPU ticks of delay before the IRQ fires fixes it. I've implemented (what I think is) the correct polling points for interrupts, so it shouldn't be that (though it's possible that I've messed up somewhere of course).

You could check if you get the same thing to see if you're displaying enough of the screen I guess. On other screens you get an even bigger gray flashing thing on the right.<br /><br />In my emu, on Everdrive, and on infiniteneslives' MMC3 implementation you get jumpiness and (I'm guessing, since that's what I get) some minor flashing on the right, which would make sense with what's going on. So either those three are broken (not sure what's going on with PowerPak - it's weird) or there's something different about Acclaim's MMC3 chip. The IRQ firing slightly later would make sense, since that seems to fix it.<br /><br />Anyone with an Acclaim MMC3 chip (<!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://bootgod.dyndns.org:7777/search.php?unif=ACCLAIM-MC-ACC">http://bootgod.dyndns.org:7777/search.p ... AIM-MC-ACC</a><!-- m -->) willing to do some measurements? Mickey's Safari in Letterland is another game with the same chip that has jumpiness (in Nestopia and my emu - and hopefully not on the real thing).

What mapper set is being used on your Powerpak (stock ones from Bunnyboy vs. loopy's) matters here, I'm fairly certain, so we should disclose what we're using exactly.<br /><br />I appreciate what you uploaded -- that really helps me to know what to look for.  Nope, wasn't seeing anything like that.  That almost looks like the gobbledegook seen in The Guardian Legend (where the screen splits), which I think is related to sprite #0 (going off memory here, could be wrong).<br /><br />Also, just for shits and giggles, I <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tosb2JtPv0M" class="postlink">uploaded the full video to Youtube</a>.  It's about 7:40 long, since I adjust the CRT and show all of what I'm doing.  Parts that you'll be interested in (shots relevant to what you uploaded) are at 1:05, 2:05, and 5:50.  The rest is more or less just me futzing around.  Again sorry for the video quality, <a href="http://www.dpreview.com/reviews/canonsd850is" class="postlink">my camera</a> is just a simple point-and-shoot.<br /><br />I'll bust out the PowerPak and report back.  I'll try to figure out what exact mapper set (zip, etc.) I'm using as well (certain it's loopy's, just not sure what &quot;revision&quot; (if there is one)).

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Here's my follow-up:<br /><br />I do see issues when running this game under a PowerPak.<br /><br />I tested 3 mapper sets, each with 5 Crash Dummies ROMs, so a total of 15 tests.  All 3 mapper sets had the same issue with the same ROMs, so effectively there's no functional difference between the mapper sets WRT this game.  The mapper sets I tested:<br /><br />- POWERPAK134105.zip -- &quot;Base/stock&quot; RetroUSB PowerPak set, v1.34<br />- powerpak_loopy.zip -- circa 2010 sometime -- definitely differs from the below<br />- powerpak_loopy.zip -- 2011-11-17 (according to loopy's site), i.e. the most recent set as of this writing<br /><br />And the ROMs w/ their results:<br /><br />- Incredible Crash Dummies, The (U) [!p].nes -- issue described below<br />- Incredible Crash Dummies, The (U) [b1].nes -- issue described below<br />- Incredible Crash Dummies, The (U) [b2].nes -- issue described below<br />- Incredible Crash Dummies, The (U) [b3].nes -- issue described below + bad graphics/audio<br />- Incredible Crash Dummies, The (U) [o1].nes -- issue described below<br /><br />Note that none of the ROMs have (!) in their name, which according to the GoodNES docs indicates a ROM that is absolutely correct/confirmed not to have any dumping-related errors.<br /><br />Now, the issue I see is this:<br /><br />- Screens with a text scroller have a 1-pixel-height line of gobbledegook that flashes right above the scrolling text.  Width of the line is about 2/3rds of the screen<br />- Screens with &quot;static text&quot; (text beneath an image), including those which also have the text scroller, will have the entire block of static text &quot;jostle&quot; or &quot;jiggle&quot;.  The text appears to shift upwards 1 horizontal row<br />- Gobbledegook above scroller and jiggling text happens &quot;most&quot; of the time, but not always -- sometimes after a &quot;full screen transition&quot; it won't happen.  It isn't specific to any particular screen, it really is like it's random<br />- Still graphics at the top of the screen (the dummies, logo, etc.) do not ever jostle or have issues<br />- I do not see a &quot;blotch&quot; on the centre-right of the screen, or anywhere else<br /><br />Two videos I made in the process showing the behaviour -- again, sorry for the quality, not much I can do about it given the wonderful design of my camera...<br /><br />- <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lL-e_HP7qTc">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lL-e_HP7qTc</a><!-- m --><br />- <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eyi-lQP1vRM">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eyi-lQP1vRM</a><!-- m --><br /><br />Too bad I don't own a capture card.<br /><br />My gut feeling is that the game is either doing mid-screen PPU writes and either taking too long at some points, or (more likely) botching the address that the internal part of the PPU needs to have to &quot;properly&quot; (i.e. no glitching) resume where it was drawing.  I think the &quot;blotch&quot; you're seeing is probably the same thing.<br /><br />Dwedit's explanation seems most likely, but it could also be something like what I said.  Mid-screen PPU updates are always tricky.  What I can't explain (because I'm not an EE guy or fully understand the hardware) is why this would happen only on a PowerPak.<br /><br />And I can't dump the mask ROMs because my programmer/dumper is from the late 90s thus parallel-based.  *grumbles* :P

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Thanks for those videos. Shows it clearly enough. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />The glitching on PowerPak is just what I get in my emulator. Might be a generic MMC3 timing issue, but the only games that act up so far are Crash Dummies and that Mickey game, which both use use the Acclaim chip (granted, I haven't tried out hundreds of different MMC3 games yet). The glitch is timing-dependent, and caused by the game disabling/enabling rendering right around dot 256 on certain scanlines, where the vertical nametable position is bumped if rendering is enabled. If rendering is disabled too late or enabled too early, you get an extra vertical bump, which causes the graphics below that point to move up one scanline and messes up the top line of the text (since it no longer appears where the game thinks it will).<br /><br />Re. River City Ransom, I think the composite PPU draws thin borders around the picture. Those would be the &quot;left border&quot; and &quot;right border&quot; in <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://wiki.nesdev.com/w/index.php/NTSC_video">http://wiki.nesdev.com/w/index.php/NTSC_video</a><!-- m -->.<br /><br />So either something is different about the Acclaim MMC3, or the timing is just so tight that lots of different things get it wrong. I have implemented what I think are the proper IRQ polling points in my emulator (which fixed shaking in Magician), though bugs are possible of course.<br /><br />In Mickey's Safari in Letterland the status bar only shakes while the screen moves vertically. Where it &quot;settles&quot; seems to depend on the current vertical scroll as well (same thing in Nestopia).<br /><br />&quot;Du kan dricka&quot; means &quot;you can drink&quot; in Swedish btw, just in case you weren't aware of that. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" />
