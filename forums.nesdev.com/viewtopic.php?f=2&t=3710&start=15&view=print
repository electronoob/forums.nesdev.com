		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Well, I guess we'll have to wait and see about your boss. I'm so mad about my game engine, I've scrapped it about 3 times before, due to bad programming. But I'm just about done with the scrolling engine, and everything is going SOOOO well. Before I wasn't really calculating anything as much as I was doing guess and check. But now, everything is done with math in my game, and I feel so good about it. But yeah, I'm not even close to the game part of it, I'll have to do music after I finish the scrolling engine, which should be today, hopefully.
<br />
<br />I'm making a game that's pretty much exactly like Castlevania SOTN, and I'm really wondering if I should make the main character out of more than one pallete. I'm thinking no, because he has yellowish hair, and he's wearing all black, pretty much. This would be really hard anyways, because you have to have all other enemies different with the aid of only two palletes. I suppose that's only for the enemies who are on screen. Once they're off screen, you can update the pallete. The enemies would have to be at the very least 256 pixels away from each other. Also, in a side scroller, I only have 64 sprites to work with, I can't just waste a ton of them on the main character...
