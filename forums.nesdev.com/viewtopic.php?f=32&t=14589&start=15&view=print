I never read anybody complain that Link has pink hair in a Link to the Past or that the sprite is drawn in SD style instead of being tall and stylized. He also looks 5 years old ingame.</div><br />The pink hair is indeed a strange issue. And a total exception, by the way. This was never done again with any &quot;Zelda&quot; game, as far as I remember.<br /><br />Also, I'm not talking about the graphics style. I'm talking about actual properties of the character.<br /><br />Yes, I'm aware that artwork and sprite style often clashes. Like with &quot;Layla&quot;:<br /><div class="attachtitle">Attachment:</div><div class="attachcontent">
			<img src="./download/file.php?id=6386" alt="Layla.png" /><br />
			<span class="gensmall">Layla.png [ 117.42 KiB | Viewed 3065 times ]</span>
		

		<br />
	</div><br /><br />But the difference is: You still see that this is Layla. She has the bangs, the leotard and her backpack.<br /><br />Same with Link: He might be drawn in a cuter style than in the artworks, but you still see that it's Link.<br /><br />&quot;Pokémon&quot; does the same, showing Ash/Red in his original artwork first and transforming him into the small sprite. But the basic properties are still there.<br /><br />Your character on the other hand could just as well be a completely different person:<br />The clothes don't match. They don't even come close.<br />The sprite has no feminine proportions, despite the fact that you went out of your way to design the artwork as fanservice.<br /><br />There's just a total disharmony between artwork and sprite. That sprite, that's not the sexy witch from the artwork. That's a possible companion of Little Nemo.<br /><br />Please understand that I'm not saying that the sprite is bad in itself. If this was supposed to be Lala's little sister, I wouldn't have said anything.<br />I'm just saying that it doesn't live up to what the artwork implies.<br /><br />Simple character design is not really an excuse. You know what game also has simple character design? &quot;Donkey Kong&quot;. And yet, if you have a look at the original artworks and then at the sprites, you have no problems accepting that the Pauline sprite is actually a legitimate representation of her drawing.<br /><br />So, this is not about different graphics styles or about different levels of detail. This is about the game showing a blue robot with an arm cannon while the artwork shows some guy in a yellow-blue suit with a gun in his hand. Only that in your case it's the other way around (i.e. the artwork is better than the sprite) and your yellow-blue suit is a baby's romper suit.<br /><br />In the end, it's your decision after all, though. I just wanted to voice my concerns.

This type of stuff is the norm, if you haven't noticed. I'm willing to bet your <em>pet peeve</em> is in the vast minority. Style/substance.. it's all subjective. I see no problem with it. Fits the era of the console. Moving on..<br /><br /> I was going to ask for the source, but then I saw that you guys are the original crew who did the game (I was thinking of a port to another system).

He has a problem that I <em>state</em> my opinion.<br /><br />The following is not a problem for me:<br />Person 1: &quot;I think that A is true because of B.&quot;<br />Person 2: &quot;That's stupid. A is clearly false because of C.&quot;<br />Person 1: &quot;C is nonsense. Have you ever considered D?&quot;<br />Person 2: &quot;Sure, but D is disproven by E.&quot;<br /><br />That's all good and well. Both sides embrace the discussion.<br /><br />It only becomes a problem when one of these persons says:<br />&quot;Dammit, stop it already. This topic is a nitpicky issue anyway.&quot;<br /><br />Somebody can argue with me all day, I have no problem with that. People can disagree with me and state their opinion as much as they want. It only becomes a problem when they complain about the act of discussion itself.<br /><br />There's a difference between &quot;I think you're wrong and here is why&quot; and &quot;I think you're wrong and you should stop stating your opinion since this discussion gets on my nerves.&quot;<br /><br />The first of these two is what you described: Someone disagrees and so he feels the urge to tell me.<br /><br />The second thing is what I desribed: After my initial post, I don't write anything unless someone reponds to it. As long as someone responds to it, I will answer if I feel like it.<br />If he doesn't just have a problem with my opinion, but with the very fact of me writing an answer at all, then he needs to stop discussing.<br /><br />People need to decide:<br />Do they want to argue with me (i.e. do they have a problem with my opinion)? Then they should accept that I argue back.<br />Or don't they want this argument to go on (i.e. do they have a problem with the very concept of a discussion)? Then maybe they shouldn't argue themselves.<br /><br />You cannot post an argument and then demand that the discussion is stopped and that your argument is the last word.<br /><br />You see the difference?

Here's a distinction I'd like to make:<br /><br />If I you were to suggest something about a game, and instead of engaging you in an argument about whether that suggestion is true or not, I said instead:<br /><br />&quot;<strong>You're making suggestions rudely, and it's making this conversation unpleasant.</strong>&quot;<br /><br />Such a statement is still relevant to the thread and discussion, even though it's not the argument <em>you</em> wanted to have. Maybe the conversation isn't about who had the last word, but whether those involved are enjoying it or getting anything useful out of it? In this view, saying &quot;I'll shut up if you will&quot; is probably not an appropriate response.
