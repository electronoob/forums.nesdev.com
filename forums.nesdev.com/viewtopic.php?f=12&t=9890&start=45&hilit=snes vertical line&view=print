		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Interesting. I should mention that while it's not in the picture I do have a few sizable caps on the 5V <span class="posthilit">line</span>. Furthermore, the apple charger I used provides 5W, rather than the USB standard of 2.5W (500mA @ 5V), which should make a huge difference for high-draw carts. I don't own an everdrive, just several expansion-IC carts like Starfox, Gokujo Parodius, etc. to test with. I would check / take more pictures for you but I just sold that <span class="posthilit">SNES</span> for an unfair amount and no longer have it. <br /><br />I'm not sure why it helped the bars on mine but not yours, that is weird. On my stock SFC I noticed on a particular grey screen that there are VERY VERY faint 8px bars similar to the original Famicom, and then checked on every other <span class="posthilit">SNES</span> / SFC I could get my hands on, and sure enough they are very faintly there. Check the dark grey screen often seen in Kirby Bowl / Kirby's Dream Course to see what I mean.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">marvelus10 wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">I wonder if this will also fix the slight blurriness of the RGB on the older models (non 1chip)?</div><br /><br />I am replacing the encoder on mine with a CXA2075; I will let you know how that goes.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />The Samsung charger for my Galaxy Note 2 puts out 2A and that still gave a ton of noise with the Super Everdrive. I'm not certain it has anything to do with power draw of the cart, as everything looked great running off of a laptop USB port. I used a similar method to you of just hooking up a snipped USB cable to the charger and running that to the 7805 I and O lines, so I could just unplug from the charger and try it in a bunch of different USB options.<br /><br />It might just come down to the quality of the charger output. After the Kindle charger really let me down (it was my first choice since I never used it) I took a good look at <a href="http://www.righto.com/2012/10/a-dozen-usb-chargers-in-lab-apple-is.html" class="postlink">this page comparing USB chargers with a scope</a> and just decided to bite the bullet and pick up an Apple charger (the Sony one was also good but not mine).

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Thanks for the link to that charger comparison; that's very valuable information. I know I'll be getting rid of some of my cheaper chargers! It's too bad a wall wart with a linear regulator isn't compared. I trust wall warts far more than switching supplies, because there's little to go wrong and their failure modes are generally not equipment-destroying. I wouldn't trust a dinky switching supply for well-regulated power, since lots of them feed a switching regulator inside the device (e.g. most cable modems and routers I've had).

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I added the disc capacitor and I can still see a bit of a bar. Not sure if there's really improvement or not without being able to do a side by side comparison tough. Maybe a bit but it did not really remove it. As far as I'm concerned, I do not think I'll mess around testing more anything else anymore. The issue is less annoying to me than going back and forth soldering stuff to the motherboard and then going to my TV to test.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />They might do that. In the Game Doctor SF3 copier someone noticed that the floppy drive was not getting enough power which was causing read errors and other reliability issues. They fixed this by installing a second regulator that powered just the floppy drive. But you'll need to be sure your external power brick provides enough amperage. That may be a bit tricky for the <span class="posthilit">SNES</span> which has a unique power plug so most power bricks tend to be rated just 850ma. But I suppose you could change the power jack on your <span class="posthilit">SNES</span> console. <br /><br />I wonder if giving DRAM it's very own power regulator would help. But then again, I've never seen this issue.

If it's too high, it increases resistance, and if too low, decreases resistance. So if you had a second regulator that was keeping the voltage higher than the first liked, the first would basically be stepping aside while the second kept it higher and did all the work.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">If you could somehow separate the system into two separate rails that were coupled together you could run two powersupplies.

But I think we've found that it's not that the <span class="posthilit">SNES</span> is drawing too much current, it's that the rails aren't low enough resistance, and there is inadequate decoupling capacitance near the DRAM and PPUs.<br /><br />I like the separate regulator for the DRAM idea in terms of getting it off the PPU's rail, but then if one of the regulators fails or comes disconnected, you have the system partially powered, with some chips sending signals to powered off ones.
