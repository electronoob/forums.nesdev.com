<br />
<br />About the PIC mapper, the NES can just write data to it (at $5x00-$5xFF), the command (what to do with the data) depends on the register location.  Simple enough. 
<br />
<br />When the PIC wants to write to the NES, I've come up with an IRQ-based protocol where the NES will get interrupted and read twice from the PIC (once for data, again for 'command').  I'll have it all documented, and of course there will be routines that can do all this in the BIOS.  The IRQ vector will probably point somewhere in RAM, for the best speed/flexibility (especially needed when using the sound synth, high IRQ overhead would be a problem there).
<br />
<br />What you'll be able to do with the PIC, if desired, is write your own routines for each register (other than the default ones that do the basic controll stuff needed by the BIOS).
<br />
<br />I'll try to supply some code templates and examples for the PIC program.  I might supply full code or a listing of the NES BIOS also.

<br />
<br />Testing the 2nd revision PCB has taken longer than expected, due to a combination of manufacturing issues and a possible design flaw regarding the address-latch enable timing.  The thing seems to work though, with some effort.  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" />
<br />But there probably will be, unfortunately, yet another board revision needed.
<br />
<br />The first version of the board works well, but it costs more to make.  If there could be enough interest, I'm feeling inclined to do a small run for developers to use while further development continues.  Then I would offer a trade-up for the next version once it could become available.
<br />
<br />The software differences are only in the PIC (and simple, only a few I/O pins swapped).  But with it being a smaller board run (maybe 25), and using more expensive parts on top of that, the price would be near the upper end of the price range I mentioned before ($100).

<br />Seems to be ok.
<br />
<br />I'm going to be releasing an NES multicart to raise funds for building these Squeedo carts.  It has Munchie Attack, Hot Seat Harry, and Solar Wars.  It's sold out before I've even built the things.  I want to make more game carts sometime later, so if I do that I can pay someone royalties if they want their game to be on a cart.  There's no concrete plans beyond the first multicart in the series for now though.

<br />With all of that ROM space on the PIC, are you storing the firmware in the pic or in a separate ROM?

<br />
<br />The PIC side of the firmware is in it's internal flash, starting at the lowest code addresses, since that suits it best.  PICs architecture doesn't allow running code directly from RAM or external memory.  But it can reprogram itself, and all that.
<br />
<br />The NES side of the firmware still has to use the last 64kB sector in the main flash memory.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />OK, time for another update about what's going on.
<br />
<br />The PIC dev hardware I ended up needing to program the new chips is taking quite a while to get here.  On the slow boat from Thailand I guess, heh.  As soon as it gets here and I evaluate the new chip, I'll be proceeding to order whichever type works best.  It's an agonizing wait, heheh.  Looks like the 18f452 recently became a 'mature product' too, perfect timing.
<br />
<br />Thanks to Jagasian's suggestion, I ordered some samples of FRAM chips by Ramtron (and they were kindly supplied).  I figured I try them out as a non-volatile replacement for the WRAM on Squeedo, and they work.  So if there's some interest in developing with these, let me know.
<br />
<br />From a software POV it's no replacement for NV-SRAM though, since all their 5V ones have limited durability.  As it puts it in the datasheet, each column (of 4 consecutive bytes) can be accessed 30 times per second for 10 years in the 32kB version (~$11) or 3000 times per second for 10 years in the 8kB version (~$6).  Optimizing the memory usage somehow could make it last longer though.
<br />
<br />Saving to the main flash memory is always an option on Squeedo of course.  But automatic saving of individual bytes is kinda nice too, so I thought I'd put that out there as an option.  Might be good for some applications.

If Ramtron made unlimited durability 5v FRAM, could you replace the flash RAM with it?  How much would that increase costs?  Unlimited durability FRAM instead of flash would be ideal for homebrewers that like to do frequent tests of code changes.  Has Ramtron made any statements about their 5v line and possibly extending it with unlimited durability FRAMs?
<br />
<br />Speaking of "mature", the Altera Cyclone EP1C3T100C8 is only $10 per chip.  Put that in the Squeedo along with that new PIC, and you could have a cart that has better support for popular NES mappers, as well as a midi-cart, and a Color Dreams "SuperCartridge".  Basically a little something for everybody.  Casual gamers would buy for the common mapper support, audio-philes would buy for the midi support, and homebrewers would buy for the SuperCartridge features (the highend PIC).  But that would require allot of work, so maybe do something like that for Squeedo II?

Judging purely from the costs of the FRAMs that are available, I'm guessing a large 512kB one would be really expensive.  Like well over $100, heh.  So I'm guessing they won't be made that large until they can do it cheaply enough, which probably also means no 5V since I'm guessing there's not as much of a market for them compared to lower voltages.<br /><br />And yeah, reading the chip does wear it down.  It'd be awesome if they could make some unlimited durability 5V ones (and hopefully not much more expensive, heh).<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">But that would require allot of work, so maybe do something like that for Squeedo II?</div>

<br />Yeah, actually I obtained an Altera JTAG cable but sadly I don't have anything to hook it up to yet, heh.  I really do want to try a project with some programmable logic sometime, for sure.  I've got a few crazy ideas.  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" />
<br />
<br />I also thought about maybe trying out a SD card interface for Squeedo (using the expansion port).  Maybe not immediately, but I think it's possible hardware-wise if it was desirable enough.

<br />
<br />I had to stuggle with some dumb bugs in the communications code, but that mostly works now.  I'm running it at 115.2kbaud.
<br />
<br />I took the Squeedo prototype permanantly off life-support (not using the EPROM emulator anymore, basically).  And it's functioning really well.  I implemented NSF flashing today, it already works fine with any non-bankswitched NSFs.  Downloading a 24kB NSF takes around 6 seconds.
<br />
<br />Next step is to do program loading properly.  Once I no longer have to swap the chip out to reprogram the main BIOS code, I think it'll be safe to say it's basic functionality is complete.

<br />
<br />Here's the cart running in a (partially disassembled) toploader.  The pic came out really dark though, and is now pretty screwed up from me brightening it.
<br /><img src="http://mywebpages.comcast.net/memblers/squeedo/pics/running-toodark.jpg" alt="Image" />
<br />The LED is a big orange one.  I'll likely be using a smaller crystal than the one on that cart (doesn't fit in a case too well).
<br />
<br />Here's how it looks on the PC side right now, while selecting bank 2 and uploading/playing the Metal Gear NSF (no NSF info display yet though, it'll be easy enough to add).
<br /><img src="http://mywebpages.comcast.net/memblers/squeedo/pics/terminal.jpg" alt="Image" />
<br />
<br />NES display (just a partial mirror of what's on the terminal for now)

<br />
<br />The goal also is to be able to load an NES program just by running a command on PC and cycling the NES's power.  That should make development pretty easy.
<br />
<br />It'll autodetect the file you give it from several formats:
<br />NSF
<br />iNES
<br />raw program (first 2 bytes are the load address), can load to RAM also.
<br />squeedo format (TBD, but will contain extra stuff like the program title and PIC code/data)
<br />
<br />Here's an up-close view of the rev2 PCBs with yellow soldermask, only being used for <a href="http://www.wayfar.net/" class="postlink">http://www.wayfar.net/</a>'s Midines 1.1 for now.
<br /><a href="http://mywebpages.comcast.net/memblers/squeedo/pics/yellow.jpg" class="postlink">http://mywebpages.comcast.net/memblers/squeedo/pics/yellow.jpg</a>
<br />
<br />Not sure when I'll start selling it, but it'll be as soon as I'm satisfied with the stability of the loading code.  Not long now.
