For me, im still trying to work on my Megaman 3 rom hack. I do not have a title for it still yet. I started this project in August 2005.  I didn't really get started "for reals" until sometime in mid 2006 when one day i asked on the acmlm board forums if someone would of been able to help draw a graphic of Rush for my title screen, and then eventually that person has sticked around with me ever since luckily. And that's when i decided to restart my game all over from the beginning. <br /><br />Now i wanna make the best known megaman rom hack of all time, surpassing the most popular ones ever like rockman exile, and exhaust. <br />I would get smarter and smarter very quickly at learning 6502 ASM, and over these years, i can now do almost anything i want only if i "feel like it".<br /><br />I have a very good reputation with the japanese 2ch community on the rockman/megaman dicussion 2ch boards. They know about me and my game, since i've talked there alot. And i have even talked with a few other japanese megaman rom hackers in the past.<br /><br />I dont think my game is that well known really too much yet. I keep saying to myself that i seriously need to start my own project thread on acmlm, romhacking.net, or rockmanPM forums ...but i just still keep putting it off cause i dont feel ready yet. <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" alt=":(" title="Sad" /><br /><br />But the biggest problem is that im horribly slow. i've been literally doing everything almost alone by myself. The only partner i have is that 1 guy i mentioned above, who helps with graphics and sprite design. As of today of over 3 years work on my game, i only have 1 single level done officially. <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" alt=":(" title="Sad" /><br /><br />I am afraid im seriously never going to ever finish this<br />but it is my life goal until i die.<br /> ...i want to somehow someday in the future finish my game, and i hope it'll pay off, and be just as recognizeable (or more) than the the most well know of all time ever such as Dhark Daiz's Mario Adventure, that zelda parallel worlds, tweaker's Sonic Megamix, etc etc.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3920">kuja killer</a> — Mon Aug 17, 2009 8:46 am</p><hr />

So I was tinkering a bit with my new platform game today. And I realized I left myself what seemed like a fairly broken game to fix. It was giving me invalid opcodes, and the sprites weren't displaying correctly. Luckily I remembered that I was just testing what would happen if I made a screen's RLE tile go past the end of the screen. (Which would overwrite needed parts of my RAM with as many garbage bytes as the RLE tile ran over the screen size) After commenting out .db $80 (purposely put there so I would know when I ran into such a case) the game ran fine, and without it being there, the game just ignores RLE tiles that go too far, anyway. The game was pretty much fine, I just left a small debug test in there. Scared the pants off me.<br /><br />Edit: No... wait. My sprites still aren't displaying correctly. They have transparent horizontal lines across then on certain scanlines. Something's wrong with my NMI logic, I think.<br /><br />Edit2: It looks like it's because I disable and enable rendering at stupid times. Hmm...<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3504">Kasumi</a> — Fri Jul 17, 2009 1:55 pm</p><hr />

Let me see if I understood it well.  So basically, you never change the mirroring and just start to write where the black bar is with new data and after that your start "cursor" location offset must now be changed to the new resulting black bar. The more you go a direction, the more it's affected. That's why you must keep a reference.<br /><br />I'm still early in the development of my learning project so I can change what I did anytime but right now I'm working in PPU increment 32 since it really, really make things easier for decoding for a side scroller.  If the offset of the starting data change, that would make the metatile buffer writing a little bit more complicated.  The idea is interesting thought. <br /><br />What I had in mind (and I don't know if this is correct but the mega man series "seems" to do that) is to change the mirroring when I need to scroll up or down.  This way you won't have any artifact in the over scan area. But because of the black bar... I cannot do that (I think).<br /><br />I must meditate on the subject. I like the idea but that seems to make things more wicked for the buffer writing. But since the game doesn't scroll much up or down... Maybe it's not so bad. hmmm...<br /><br />edit:<br /><br />@_mic:  Completely forgot to say some comment regarding your project, how rude of me!
