<br />it's not compatibly with everything, it has at least problem with loading one game (don't remember which one though)... looks like the transfere speed is a bit slow too :/

<br />
<br />I want one as well but needing a GBA cart to use it is ridiculous(that and I don't really trust NeoFlash). They mustn't have sold very many of their newer GBA carts and instead of binning them they are trying to make a quick buck. Hopefully one day bunnyboy makes a PowerPak for the 64.

<br />
<br />Didn't read your post correctly, sorry. I wouldn't bug him about it, the NES and SNES PowerPaks seem to drain alot of his money so he might be a bit wary about a 64 one.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />My biggest complaint about Neoflash is that they announce all kinds of projects that then end up as vaporware (where's their NES cart for example?).
<br />
<br />I'll have to disagree with the people who say that Neoflash make poor products that should be avoided, though. I own the MD Myth cart and the Power PC-E flash cart, and they both work great. And on the software side you get a lot of free support, since they open-source a lot of the software and other people step up and add new features (just look at the MD Myth, and the same thing is now happening with the N64 cart).
<br />
<br />And the price isn't really that high compared to other backup devices for the N64 (if you can find one). Personally I doubt I'll buy one since there are very few N64 games that I consider worth playing, so the only reason for me to buy one would be to run my own code on the N64 and I don't really have any projects that I'd like to do on the N64 right now.
<br />
<br />I do hope that they continue to create backup devices for more consoles, though. It's a real niche market, and they're one of the few to do this on a relatively large scale.

<br />GBA is the only common consumer form factor for NOR memory. Everything else (CF, SD, Memory Stick) is a <a href="http://pineight.com/ds/block/" class="postlink">block device</a> using <a href="http://wiki.pocketheaven.com/NAND_and_NOR" class="postlink">NAND memory</a> and would require megabytes of PSRAM to buffer the data, just like in the SNES PowerPak. I wonder how much hacking it would take to use the cheaper $20 "EZFlash 3-in-1" GBA cart instead of NeoFlash's overpriced GBA cart.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />there would b less point in using the 3 in 1 since you would have to use its flash and that's almost the same as the cart it comes with. It has RAM for fast loading of GBA games from a NDS flashcart so it may be ok for development if it could be used in a way that would allow it to always be connected to a computer
<br />
<br />Hacking it to use one of the other reasonably priced RAM adapter carts rather than the way overpriced NEO2 would be what I would want so I could use a memory card.
<br />
<br />As for the quality of NEO flashes products yes some of them are ok but there is a hell of a lot of crap in the mix too.

<br />Sort of like this project. <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://64dev.retroactive.be/forum/viewtopic.php?t=52">http://64dev.retroactive.be/forum/viewtopic.php?t=52</a><!-- m -->

<br />I really hope someone brings a product like that to market as it really makes alot more sense and the method works so well with the Nintendo DS.
