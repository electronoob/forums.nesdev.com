[Just maybe, if this thread fails to collect all the required infos.] But back on topic.<br /><br />I would like to understand how a ram-cart or rather the CopyNES itself works. I can understand why to bow certain pins on eproms, or how some mappers work. And I did some basic demos. But I can not put all that together myself, so I could create a dev-cart and a plugin for a given cart.   <img src="./images/smilies/icon_confused.gif" alt=":?" title="Confused" /> <br /><br />I dont want to buy a powerpak - I want to understand how it actually works.  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_redface.gif" alt=":oops:" title="Embarassed" /> <br /><br />Someone on here, that can explain the mystery of writing dev-carts with the copyNES?<br /><br />Thanks in advance,<br />ninn

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Replacing the ROMs with SRAM that is appropriate is the first step. The next depends on the mapper being used. I think generally mappers like MMC3 will be disabling PRGROM when you attempt to write to the ROM area as it expects you are writing registers. I'm not sure what you'd have to do to overcome that. <br /><br />Maybe you could modify the cartridge so you could map any part of SRAM into the PRG-RAM area of the cartridge. Didn't the PowerPAK Lite support MMC1? So that sort of issue was tackled somewhere, though it isn't an original ASIC so perhaps the CPLD code was modified for it.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />The basic problem is differentiating writes to the mapper(banswitching) and writes to the PRG-ROM(for programming). when you're writing to SRAM's externally through the cart connector.<br /><br />From what I understand the powerpak lite and copyNES uses the EXP0 signal as a 'mapper disable' signal.  So if you want to write to the PRG-ROM you'd disable the mapper first, so it doesn't swap banks on you as you're programming the cart.<br /><br />Not sure if that's the 'mystery' you're referring to, but that's the main issue that needs to be resolved to program a cart externally.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I have been thinking in this for a long time.<br /><br />In order to interface with the computer, I have been thinking in using either a UART I removed from an old 8086 motherboard, or bit-banging through the controller ports. Bit-banging is something I wouldn't like to use, as I use several NES and famiclones with varying grades of accuracy.<br /><br />The bootloader would be either stored on a cartridge or inside the NES along with the UART, so I could use it to dump cartridges.<br /><br />Personally, the way to go is having a ROM with a bootloader (and maybe a supervisor) and an UART at $4028 (unused, so it does not conflict with exotic mappers like the CopyNES sometimes does) inside the console with an independent RAM cart.
