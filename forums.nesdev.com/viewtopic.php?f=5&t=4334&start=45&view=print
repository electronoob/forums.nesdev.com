<br />If you don't have a status bar, that should be enough for a game. Some systems have only 192 scanlines, after using some for a status bar only about 160 are left for the game, and many games like that exist.
<br />
<br />Anyway, I wasn't talking about a game, just a dynamic demo, where the frames wouldn't need to be pre-stored in the ROM. Although I think Another World uses the polygon engine through the whole game, and it worked out pretty well.
<br />
<br />I understand why it wouldn't work in your case... The CPU is already pretty busy as it is, if it had to process game logic as well, it'd run at 1 FPS, like you said.

My guess is he isn't, because his goal for this engine is not to make one of those "super cool mega demos", he's actually trying to be original and make movies of things that actually resemble things you'd find in a real (or fantasy) world, like the entities in an actual a game.<br /><br />When you start talking like that it just seems you are showing off, trying to make us see the cool stuff you have made.

Several, actually. But it is theoretically possible to do real 3D rendering with my engine, though it'd be terribly slow and the complex checks would take way too long. It'd run at like a frame a second, probably XD.<br /><br />Also, the display area is 160 scanlines large. There are 40 on top and bottom that aren't visible. This isn't a very good looking display area for a game. It would be a headache to play, probably. It's fine for movies, since it makes it more cinematic like widescreen.</div>
<br />
<br />originally 3dfloor8 only ran at one frame a second, and it looked great due to the blitting effect i used in order to span between frames. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />

<br />Although the QBasic scene was quite active (I followed it pretty closely from 1996 to about 2001), i don't think it was the "major" one. I don't know if emulation killed it, but I certainly left QB for the NES.
