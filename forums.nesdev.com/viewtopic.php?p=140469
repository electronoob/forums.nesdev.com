						<div class="postbody">I don't know about the rest of you, but I love hearing &quot;childhood stories&quot; involving video games.  I guess if you picked up &quot;classic gaming&quot; as an adult then that would apply too, but since I'm a nostalgic and was born in 1977, I tend to focus on things from ~1984-1994 the most (but for others the time frame may vary).  So I thought I'd share one to start the thread off + give people an idea of what I mean.  Because &quot;I went to a video arcade when I was 7 and it was totally awesome.  The end!&quot; doesn't count.  ;-)  They can be as short or long as you want.  Bonus points to those who have actual pictures from the era (of themselves or general areas/whatever).<br /><br /><blockquote style="margin-left: 1%; padding-left: 1%; border-left: 3px solid #555577;">
I was in junior high at the time, I think age 13, so it would have been 1990.  I was completely enthralled by the NES &#40;ex. I did <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/xkr4cpo333g5roj/howard_phillips_paper_1990.png?dl=0" class="postlink">a short report on Howard Phillips</a>&#41;, and by that point had been exposed to the Famicom as well &#40;through Chinese and Japanese friends I had in grade school&#41;.  I can&#39;t remember a single day going by where I couldn&#39;t wait for school to end and the school bus to get me home, just so I could rush down our gravel road to my home and play whatever game I&#39;d been thinking about all day.  The NES was an integral part of my life.<br /><br />Brief data point: the junior high I went to had a very strange programme which lasted only 2 years: once a week, for 45 minutes, students who had basically never seen or rarely interacted with other students were put into a room together and &quot;forced&quot; to interact.  It must have taken the school some effort to take every student&#39;s schedule, analyse all the data, and figure out who had never &#40;or least&#41; interacted with who.  And as anyone could have told you, the students who knew one another split up into little &quot;cliques&quot; &#40;3-4 people&#41;, and grudgingly accepted whoever they didn&#39;t know.<br /><br />Only one of my friends &#40;American&#41; was in that &quot;class&quot; with me.  But he was friends with two other students &#40;one Taiwanese, one Chinese&#41;, also with us.  We all clicked, especially when it came to talking about video games.  The two Asians were shocked that I knew of the Famicom.  Eventually we all hung out &#40;for the next 5-6 years nonetheless!&#41;, but I was quickly introduced to two Famicom games that still to this day remain my top favourites: Wai Wai World and Getsufuu Maden.<br /><br />Anyway, one day the class teacher informed us that she wanted all the &quot;groups&quot; to do a &quot;presentation project&quot; of some sort and only had a week to do it.  My American friend came up with the idea of bringing the Famicom to school just so we could play it during that period.  But a conundrum: schools then didn&#39;t have televisions in classrooms &#40;there were a couple, but strictly for-teachers-only&#41;.  But little did they know...<br /><br />About 6 months prior, I had spent nearly 3 months off and on cutting and hauling wood for my mum&#39;s co-worker.  I was to get US$75 for my labour &#40;I was getting ripped off -- this woman had an INSANE amount of wood she wanted chopped and hauled across her property, and I was a very thin/lightweight kid&#41;.  I did about half the work, eventually rescinding on my obligation because it was ridiculously exhausting.  But on the last day I saw a box on a shelf in her woodshed -- a box depicting <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=bentley+television+black+and+white&amp;safe=off" class="postlink">a portable 5&quot; B&amp;W Bentley television</a>.  The possibilities here were endless: I used to go camping, on road trips, gold panning, etc. with my step-dad -- but I also didn&#39;t have a TV of my own... I could play my NES in my bedroom!  I asked if I could see it and sure enough it had RF screw terminals on it.  I had to have it.  Of course it had no AC adapter &#40;and used a proprietary AC adapter connector so you couldn&#39;t buy a generic one&#41;, but it did work with nine &#40;9&#41; D batteries &#40;Americans will realise just how ridiculous that is, and was even for the time...&#41;<br /><br />But I was rejected -- I hadn&#39;t completed the job I promised, plus the TV cost her about $150.  After a lot of begging, offering her $50 that I&#39;d saved up for getting a better NES &#40;one with R.O.B., etc.&#41;, plus some pressure from my mum, she grudgingly agreed that she&#39;d give me the TV for the labour I did + the $50 I had.  I went home ecstatic, but then devastated that we didn&#39;t have any D-size batteries, but thankfully my grandmother did.<br /><br />I informed my comrades that I had a portable TV &#40;my American friend was like &quot;WHAT? When did you plan on telling me this?!&quot;&#41; and the plan was set in motion.  Our Taiwanese friend would bring his Famicom and I&#39;d bring the TV a week from now.  But unlike a Famicom, the TV couldn&#39;t fit into a backpack.  But I had a small duffel bag which barely worked &#40;and I do mean barely: the zipper wouldn&#39;t close all the way.  To keep it closed, I had to wrap some twine around the thing&#41;.  Oh, and it wouldn&#39;t fit in my locker, so I had to carry it around to all my classes &#40;in addition to my books&#41;, so I had to take great care to keep kids from accidentally kicking the bag with their feet.<br /><br />Finally lunch ended, the silly class started, with our &quot;presentation&quot; going last -- but we didn&#39;t really care.  Within seconds of the class starting, we had the thing hooked up.  I forgot to bring a screwdriver, so the Chinese kid used some tightly-folded paper to get the terminals on as best as possible, then used scotch tape to hold them in place.<br /><br />We didn&#39;t pay any attention to any of the other presentations -- because the instant we had that thing hooked up, the entire room lit up.  Every single kid came over and wanted to see what in hell we were doing, and were blown out of the water &#40;most had never seen a Famicom&#41;.  The reactions were all over, and everyone wanted to play.  The teacher, of course, was livid: VIDEO GAMES? IN SCHOOL? AND HOW DID YOU GET A TV IN HERE?!?!?!  But once she realised that literally every single student in that room wanted to watch this little small 5&quot; black-and-white TV playing &quot;Nintendo games they&#39;d never seen before&quot;, she gave up.  I expected to get reprimanded or suspended or something, but nothing.<br /><br />When I finished junior high, during the last day at school, that teacher came up to me and told me that what we did that day, &quot;bringing those video games in&quot;, was something that she would remember the rest of her life.  I think she said something like &quot;I didn&#39;t agree with it then and I don&#39;t agree with it now, but there was something ingenious and clever about what all of you did, making all of that happen.  I won&#39;t forget that.&quot;

						<div class="postbody">I'll write a story some other time (It's about 12:30 here in Texas) but you're story kind of reminds me of when I brought my SNES into my Spanish class last year when it was the day before spring break. A bit of a random thought, but nearly <em>everyone</em> I know accidentally calls the SNES the N64. (It's still not as bad as the &quot;Nintendo NES&quot;. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" /> ) I brought one of my favorite SNES games. (R-Type 3) I know this sounds evil, but I thought it would be humorous to see how bad they were. It took them so long to understand that the floating orange thing was not an enemy that when they got here, they thought they were at &quot;The Boss&quot;. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_lol.gif" alt=":lol:" title="Laughing" /><br /><br /><div class="attachtitle">Attachment:</div><div class="attachcontent">

						<div class="postbody">Cool stories.  I'll share a couple of short ones.<br /><br />I remember the first NES game I picked out, at Target.  At the time I only had Duck Hunt, Gyromite, and Ikari Warriors, that were given to me for xmas.  We weren't there to buy a game, but I saw Castlevania and decided that I really wanted it.  I guess I had no real concept of money, I was begging my dad for it and I remember he insisted that we don't have the money, we can't afford it.  My response to all that nonsense was &quot;just write a check!&quot;, which got some laughs.  I didn't go home with it that day, but he did buy it for me not long after.  Turned out to be a good choice, though I never beat the reaper until many, many years later. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />One day my dad came home from work with a couple of large cardboard boxes (refrigerator boxes or something) for me to have fun with.  So naturally, what I did was put them in the middle of the yard, used a wheelbarrow to transport our old small TV and my NES into the boxes, ran an extension cord to it, grabbed one of those adjustable folding lawn chairs, climbed into it, pulled the boxes together so I was closed inside, and sat in there most of the day playing Zelda 2 until the heat became unbearable (it was a hot summer day).<br /><br />I have a photo somewhere, I've been meaning to scan it but have yet to (I'm not sure where it even is, now), of xmas when I was maybe 5 (so maybe 1986 or so), with me sitting there playing Cosmic Avenger on my brand new Colecovision, on that same little TV from the previous story.  IIRC, sitting nearby in the picture was the Spiderman Parker Bros. game for Atari, and a Masters of the Universe action figure.</div>

						<div class="postbody">Let me see. I'll start with the one I tell everyone. I've been playing games before I could properly walk and talk. My folks are the very reason I got into gaming; our first system was the NES. I spent hours playing it, not as much as Duplo Blocks or TMNT action figures, but the NES become a staple of my entertainment. I was only a couple of years old, so I wasn't very good at a number of games. I soon found out that watching others play was as enjoyable as playing myself. I recall being very aware of which games or parts of games were too difficult for me, and for these I liked to watch other people play.<br /><br />One of those games was the Legend of Zelda. I distinctly remember the first time I played it alone; I suffered a terrible series of deaths from Oktoroks and Zoras. Still, over the years, I watched my mom play most of the game. She must played up until the last dungeon, from what I understand. At any rate, this one game in particular was slowly being engraved into my memory. Nearly a decade later, I had no specific memory of any one gameplay session (I mean, I played a lot of games myself, you can't expect a kid to remember everything) but little did I know my mom had basically etched a strategy guide into my brain.<br /><br />Around the time Wind Waker came out, I suddenly got the urge to play more Zelda games. There was a storm one night, lightning, thunder, and rain. It was the perfect atmosphere to dig up the NES (which we hadn't touched in like the 6 years since we moved). I went down stairs and approached the big chest we had next to the TV. It was filled with all of our board games: Candyland, Chutes and Ladders, Hungry Hungry Hippos (okay, not exactly a board game...) and the like. We used to house all of our video games (i.e. Genesis and PS1 stuff), so I figured the NES was down there at the bottom somewhere too. I had seen it there before, hadn't I? So I'm all hyped up, opening up the chest, pretending I'm like Link looking for new treasure... and I got nothing. No NES (still haven't seen it since really), and no trace of that telltale golden cartridge. It was a dark night.<br /><br />Still, I wasn't deterred. I had a Gameboy Player, and the GBA NES Classic version of LoZ had just come out. &quot;Close enough,&quot; I figured, so I went to Toys R' Us the next weekend and bought it. I popped it in under the faithful Gamecube, and I was instantly transported back to the past. I started playing, determined to actually beat the game, to succeed where mom left off, and finally defeat Ganon, save the Princess, and all of that fun stuff. The first few bits were familiar enough to anyone. You grab the old man's sword because it's dangerous to go alone, kill a few monsters for rupees, then head to the first dungeon.<br /><br />But here's where things got really weird for me. Every dungeon I went to, I already subconsciously knew what to do. I wouldn't explicitly remember what I was supposed to do, I'd just end up doing something that seemed totally random to me, but turned out to be the right thing to do. I would ask myself &quot;Hey, wtf am I doing? Why'd I bomb that wall?&quot; only to see the results moments later. In reality, it's just a simple case of forgetting stuff about a game, but to me at the time, it was surreal; I never remembered everything at once, only in a sort of &quot;real-time&quot; flashback sort of mode. What's was even stranger was that some of the later dungeons I swore my mom never made it to; she even told me as much. But still, I kept finding stuff like it was second nature. The only part I really had trouble with was finding the final dungeon's location; I'm pretty sure that portion of the game is the only part I never saw anyone play.<br /><br />Still, I was amazed that what I saw when I was around 4-6 stuck with me for all of those years. Even with the &quot;help&quot; I had, I still found the game fulfilling, like I was finally completing a circle in my life, or some zen like that <img src="./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" /></div>

						<div class="postbody">I recall when my brother and me asked &quot;Santa&quot; for &quot;The Legend of Zelda&quot; (NES) for christmas and we were so excited about it. We knew where our parents hid the presents for christmas and we were thinking about how we could figure out if Zelda was in one of the packages (they were all wrapped). And I got this idea, the Zelda-box had a hole in it! And of course, I secretly searched through the presents for a suitable wrapped gift and see if I could locate the hole with my fingers.<br />And yes, finally I located the Zelda-present. <br />Our parents never caught us. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />Another story, we got &quot;Mario Bros.&quot; for christmas (still my favourite game), it must have been 1987/88 or so. I remember me and my brother played it alot. The highest level we got to was 68. It's insane how I remember that. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /> Anyway, a few months back I brought my NES + Mario Bros to my parents house, I expected my brother to be there aswell, he didn't knew I brought this stuff. So I finally got there and showed it to him and of course we played it once again together (it was probably 30 years ago since we played it together the last time)! We never made it to level 68. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br />Two weeks later, he purchased himself a NES once again. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />Here are two photos from the 80's:<br />Some of the games we got.<br /><img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/2590713/NES/boxes.jpg" alt="Image" /><br /><br />Me in the late 80's with some games. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/2590713/NES/boxes2.jpg" alt="Image" /></div>

						<div class="postbody">I have tons of stories so let me see if I can't think of any off the top of my head. <br /><br />I remember when I was in 3rd and 4th grade going to school in the early to mid 90's. I had my own room with a color tv and an SNES with a library of around 15 games. My friends Nate and Chris also lived very close to me on my street. Chris also had an SNES and Nate had a Sega Genesis. <br /><br />We would all hang out and do stuff together like roller blade, play basket ball and of course play video games. I remember seeing Zelda a link to the past for the very first time at Chris's house. It wasn't his game, but actually his uncles game. I remember just watching some of the game play and apparently his uncle had already beaten the game as he was at the pyramid where you fight Gannon. I also remember seeing all of those items on the menu when you press start, it was mesmerizing! The first thoughts that came to my mine about Zelda 3 for the SNES were &quot;this must be a big boys game&quot; as if it were for older players since his uncle was playing it. I soon told my parents about Zelda and I eventually got a copy and its still one of my favorite games of all time. <br /><br />I guess now is a good time to plug something. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />So many years later I came across Zelda Parallel Worlds and was very inspired to create my own Zelda hack. Parallel Worlds actually introduced me to romhacking. This led me to contact Gamemakr24 who has been working on his own Zelda 3 hack for years. <br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.questforcalatia.net/Zelda3C/diary.html">http://www.questforcalatia.net/Zelda3C/diary.html</a><!-- m --><br /><br />And just to let you guys know, I've been designing and making things for this Zelda 3 hack Quest for Calatia for around 6 years. But progress on Gamemakers side is slow due to his real life.<br /><br />Now back to the story <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />When I was young it just seemed as if everything in the world were different. I remember when Nate and his sister would come over to my house to play some SNES games. We would play Mario Paint a lot and we would make sex jokes with the sounds in the music composer editor were if you pick the sun face thing and put it down as a low note you hear &quot;uhh hun&quot; like as if people were having sex! lol<br /><br />Nate and his sister would always have to be home by a certain time and I remember telling them that my clock was fast just so we could have extra time together playing games even though my clock wasn't fast at all. lol<br /><br />Since Nate and I together had the Sega Genesis and SNES we seriously had the best of both worlds. In fact there times when I would even go over to his house when he was gone when my family would go out for the night and I would rent a Genesis game and have the whole system to myself. <br /><br />Some of the greatest moments in my life were seriously sitting on a wooden bench next to my friend Nate playing Sonic 2 on his Genesis in his garage room. I would always be Tails and he would be Sonic and I would get killed and lost and left behind, but the experience was so cool that I didn't even care that I was Tails. <br /><br />Nate's parents were strict Christians and wouldn't let him do things that other regular parents would. Like he couldn't even say the word &quot;hell&quot;. Nate couldn't listen to music that was curse words in them and so he always had a bunch of Christian rock music around. I don't know why, but one day I actually brought a VHS tape with Beavis and Butthead recorded on it we played it in the living room and his parents HATED it, but Nate loved it!<br /><br />We would then secretly rent the Beavis and Butthead games and play them. There was this one day when I brought over the Genesis version on Beavis and Butthead which I had rented and we were trying to find a way to play it without his parents knowing. So we first tried to play it with the volume really low, but it wasn't any fun, but then we remembered...... the Sega Genesis headphone jack!!!<br /><br />So we played Beavis and Butthead at his house even when his parents were right in the next room over and it was a thrilling experience because we played in at the edge of our toes because we always had to be on guard to quickly turn off the game if either one of his parents should come into the room.  <br /><br />When I think of more stories I will post them. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /></div>

						<div class="postbody">I remember back in 5th grade when I proudly supported the N64 as one of the best consoles ever when I got into a small argument with and I still know his name today, Dennis. <br /><br />Dennis said that the graphics on the N-64 made everything look like a polygon and that the PlayStation had way better graphics. Its true that some PlayStation games had CGI cut scenes which looked fantastic, but usually those weren't part of the actual gameplay. And since both PS1 and N64 both used polygons to render characters and such I never saw the whole point of his argument. <br /><br />I distinctively remember this because I was in shock that someone actually had the guts to say that PS1 was better than N64 in terms of graphics because at the time I certainly believed that the N64 was far superior than the PS1. <br /><br /><br />I also remember when I first saw the PlayStation 1 in a Toys R Us store and saw the fighting game Tekken for the first time. I was totally blown away by the CGI movie scenes, but for some reason never felt compelled to actually want one as a kid. <br /><br />I guess my thinking at the time was... I'm a kid so I don't have a lot of money and I already have an SNES and since there wasn't any particular game that I was interested in playing I just never got a PS1 until many years later. <br /><br />What's really funny is when I told my friend about the PlayStation 1 that I saw at the store. I told him that I saw a very cool new video game system and that it was called the PlayStation. His reaction to the name of the console is mind blowing when I think of it as of today. My friend literally said &quot;PlayStation? That sounds like a little kids toy hahaha&quot;.<br /><br />So yeah, there you have it, my friend and I were in the 3rd or 4th grade and he seriously made fun of the PlayStation name and thought that the name of it sounded like a babies toy. Looking at this in retrospective is just hilarious! <br /><br />Who would have known that PlayStation would have been such a HUGE thing that is one of the big players in the console market today? We were just in 4th grade and it was just brand new, we didn't know how big it was going to be. <br /><br />But just the thought of a little kid actually making fun of the name PlayStation is ironic, because at face value without ever seeing the console or anything it might as well be some little kids toy, but almost nobody regards it as a little kids toy today. <br /><br />I'm guessing my friend thought PlayStation meant something like this:<br /><br /><img src="http://i48.photobucket.com/albums/f246/finaltheorygames/Educational-Toys-Super-Maze_zps5m3g7ozf.jpg" alt="Image" /><br /><br />Does anyone actually remember what these were called? The balls on the wire rigs? I swear that the big ones which were more like a table were called Playstations. Because it was like a station where you played at, like at a doctors office.<br /><br /><br />For me the only thing that mattered was Super Mario 64. Even though PlayStation looked cool I was just blown away by the N64. I used to get my mom to drop me off at my local blockbuster for hours just to I would play the N64 on display. I remember that every second that I held that controller in my hand and zoomed around the camera and jumped and controlled Mario was just the coolest thing I had ever experienced in my life. <br /><br />I actually remember renting an N64 before I got one, yes renting, remember when Blockbuster used to rent consoles? LOL. And on Christmas day that year I finally got one and it was the GREATEST thing ever in my life! EVER!!!<br /><br />Ironically when the GameCube came out I played Super Mario Sunshine, but just didn't have that same experience that I once had with Super Mario 64 when it was brand new. So because I wasn't blow away with the Gamecube I never got one. <br /><br />I honestly still don't know exactly why I felt the way I did when I played the Gamecube. Was I not as interested because I was getting a little older and &quot;grew&quot; out of video games? Was it because the leap from the SNES to N64 was so dramatic where as the leap from the N64 to the Gamecube wasn't so much? I still don't know and I still don't own a Gamecube to this day either.</div>

I know I'm a bit bias, but I mean, come one. I've seen people who say that the PS1's blocky textures look better than the N64's smooth, but blurry, textures. It's been said that the N64 has some sort of &quot;microcode&quot; or something that kind of controls how the system functions and apparently, the one that Nintendo supplied was terrible. Eventually, companies started making their own and that's how you have games like Conker's Bad Fur Day, which in my opinion, looks better than anything the PlayStation ever outputted, including the Crash Bandicoot games. Another great looking game that comes to mind is the Indiana Jones and the Infernal Machine. Rare and Factor 5 were really good at making good looking N64 games. Oh, and another good looking N64 game is Hydro Thunder. The models for the boats look amazing for an N64 game.</div>

						<div class="postbody">I remember getting very far in Banjo-Kazooie. I believe I was at the first witch battle basically at the end, but haven't won that battle yet. So one day I turned on my N-64 and for some reason didn't turn on my tv. I thought &quot;im so good at this game and know it so well that I could probably navigate my way all the way to the witch battle without even seeing any video and basically doing it blindly. <br /><br />So I imagined walking through the castle and the rooms and doors and such and when I felt that I had finally gotten to my destination I turned on the tv to see how close I was. <br /><br />When I finally turned on the tv I was shocked. I never even made it past the select screen and your not going to believe this, but I had actually DELETED my save file while I thought I was playing the game!!!<br /><br />I couldn't believe it when it happened. All my work and progress... all gone. I've never done anything like that sense.</div>

						<div class="postbody">I remember playing the N64 for the first time and thinking how wonderful it looked (I had a PS1). I had borrowed it from my brother, along with Zelda and Mario 64. It didn't take long to realized that games really lacked in textures, while PS1 games consistently made advancements in textures for games. Going back to a N64 after a while, and the difference was jarring. It was like someone smeared vaseline over the TV screen (composite). It was weird to see Nintendo, once this incredible juggernaut, get demoted to one of those loyalist-by-name only systems. I mean, the game library was pathetic in comparison to the PS1. I was an adult by then, but I only knew of one friend who actually owned the thing. He would consistently try to convince all how superior it was hardware wise; as if that made the difference. We got to play all these wonderful PS1 games, and he got to play... well, N64 games. And being an adult, a lot of us had PC gaming rigs as well (LAN parties were awesome). I kinda felt bad for big N, in a way, and was excited about the Gamecube. At least it was a much better run of games than the N64, and the vaseline effect was gone.</div>

						<div class="postbody">The &quot;Vaseline&quot; effect you're seeing comes from two . One is the N64's 4K texture limit. The other is  the N64 RDP's use of bilinear texture filtering instead of nearest-neighbor resampling. In similar situations, the PS1 would have gone all blocky. I wonder whether preferring the aliased look of PS1 textures is related to preferring the aliased look of bilevel rendering of TrueType fonts or preferring the aliased audio resampling in GBA games over the Gaussian filtering in Super NES games.</div>
