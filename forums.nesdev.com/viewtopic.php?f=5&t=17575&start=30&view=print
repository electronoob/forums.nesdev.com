		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />When Sega was asked a related question (whether they would sign off on Pier Solar as an official release IIRC), they said that Genesis is so old they don't do that anymore. However Sega isn't Nintendo, they're a lot more friendly towards fan projects.<br /><br />@rainwarrior<br />Have you considered porting Lizard to 3ds? Even if it's a sunset platform, I read that it's now easy to get things to its store, and it'd be an easy platform to port to.

I wrote this message very fast after a company party so the alcohol could be to blame <img src="./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" /> <br /><br />What I had more in mind was about the recent take down of the screenshot because of possible infringement. Since they have a contact form for legal questions, asking if the usage of that picture to explain how it works was an infringement or not could have been a possibility. I would not expect not much of an answer but it cost nothing to ask.

Is it considered fair use to use this depiction on a wiki site such as this?&quot;<br />To make a bit more watertight, maybe even post a generalized article stub on nes scrolling to wikipedia, attach the gif there, and then post the link in your question?

In the case of the Super Mario bros animation it was still a grey area but this one is very clear that we shouldn't reproduce content of such document.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Hello, everybody. Long time no see. I'm sorry for just dropping in randomly like this, but I really have a lot to say about this.<br /><br />You see, in the past before the computers, there have always been parodies about songs and books and novels and other things way before copyright existed and nobody had a problem with that. It's so natural to go and remix other people's work in order to enjoy them. I mean, it happens with jokes and puns all the time! There's no copyright on jokes or on linguistics. So why should there be copyright for the things that are our jokes and puns today? Such as video games, movies, comic books, memes, etc.. Yes, it is true that these things need protection from blatant piracy, but this huge concern about piracy is an attack on PRIVACY and creativity! Just imagine how awesome it would be if fan works were legalized. Every company would have to have a section for fan stuff. And imagine what if fans can share their works together like how Minecraft mods are shared.<br /><br />Unfortunately, such thing doesn't exist. There's also such a problem with game consoles even though all the NES hardware that we use isn't under copyright or patent protection because it has no copyrightable code and no nonexpired patent for the hardware design. This is why we always have this shadow hanging over us. We're doing what we love. We've always wanted to make our games for our loved consoles from childhood. But we simply cannot do it.<br /><br />So I have an idea. How about we all make OUR OWN console? Our own market and our own thing. Look at Gamebuino and MAKERbuino! Look at Pokitto! Gamebuino META! They're making their own games, educating young on how to build their own consoles and games, and they all share their work together and build amazing things! So what if we could make our own thing? Now, our market would be very small if we were just targetting a small group of people who are creative. Finding other creative people who like fandom stuff and derivative work stuff and general modification and editing of things is really hard. So what if we simply made our own console and our own development kit and licensed it all under the MIT License so that people can make whatever they want while also making such awesome games that we can sell to children who will make fan works of our works when they grow into teens. If we start our own fandom with this, we will be victorious! No more copyright, no more EULA, no more strings attached, no more legal nonsense!<br /><br />What do you say?
