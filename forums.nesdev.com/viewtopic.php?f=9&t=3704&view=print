<br />
<br />I have no more PCBs, so no more kits either.  The lack of usable parallel ports is a real drag, too.  coupled with the lack of windows based software from me didn't help either.  Q's program worked in windows, but he kinda quit the skene(tm) so apparently no more updates on that front either.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I believe it has to do with timing and voltage logic levels. Some systems 'underdrive' the parallel port pins, resulting in an inability for the copynes to read the command data sent, and causing it to get stuck in a state where its waiting for acknowledgement. I think.
<br />A hysteresis circuit placed on all the directional wires, and a dual-direction hysteresis circuit (tricky to make) placed on the bidirectional data lines, would fix the problem.
<br />It could be built into a parallel dongle fairly easily.

<br />I bought one from CompUSA that contained a "MOSCHIP" controller, and it didn't work. Not surprising, since it wouldn't even show (let alone allow me to change) the port's address or IRQ or anything. "Full function parallel port" my @ss. I'm guessing most PCI add-in cards are designed only to work with modern printers, ZIP drives, and the like.
