It's just not resulted in a lot of MSU1 titles. Being available in more than bsnes+sd2snes will certainly help.<br /><br />&gt; All sd2snes cartridges has msu1 support.

So all changes on the sd2snes now will be in firmware only.<br /><br />I don't know about the third-party making them, but ikari's official boards don't ship with firmware, so it'll be a familiar experience to upgrade firmware for everyone, at least.

I mix the non-inverted SNES and MSU1 audio. So if SNES is inverted, sd2snes should thusly invert before mixing samples, I guess.<br /><br />But yeah, I'd strongly recommend someone else verify this first. sd2snes may already be producing the same audio as higan.<br /><br />&gt; Any chance to see an updated Super Mario Odyssee version with .pcm files?<br /><br />Very unlikely. It was a demo of an upcoming game and died out three years ago. Likely to join Chrono Trigger FMV intro as permanently stuck on a dead interim format.<br /><br />&gt; I haven't seen it yet, but somebody mentioned an MSU1 intro for &quot;Der Langrisser&quot;, and maybe there are further MSU1 games/demos/tests...<br /><br />I never released the Der Langrisser MSU1 patch. Would have been too much work to finish (pulling in audio tracks from many different sources. Easy to hack games to use CD-audio, harder to replace all the tracks with better PCM versions.) Don't even have it anymore.<br /><br />Not really anything else out there that's been released, unfortunately. Some Youtube videos of a Zelda 3 CD-audio hack, and someone playing FMVs on their sd2snes, but I don't know where to download those from.<br /><br />&gt; At the moment I am considering to support both .pcm and .wav for backwards compatibility. The .wav format isn't exactly easy to deal with though (chunks, sample rates, pcm/adpcm/etc, 8bit/16bit, mono/stereo, and some left/right sample interleaving variants).<br /><br />I'd rather you didn't, but I can't stop you. The only game with WAV tracks is Super Mario Odyssey, which is an unfinished, single-level demo. If you support WAV, there's a chance someone else will release in WAV format in the future, which will break compatibility with both higan and sd2snes.<br /><br />And like you said, the format is a pain in the ass, and a nightmare for interoperability between implementations.<br /><br />&gt; Or are there already some .pcm files around that would conflict with those rules?<br /><br />There are not. All of those rules are good.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Thanks for the Odyssee and Akira links! Good news is that they are both using .pcm files (not .wav files).<br /><br />The Akira trailer has much better picture quality than Road Blasters. But the Akira audio is very troubling:<br />First of, it doesn't initialize the MSU volume register, so audio is totally inaudible (assuming that MSU should set volume=00h on reset) (it works when tweaking the emu to use volume=FFh).<br />And second, it does contain a fully fledged cart header which is clearly identifying it as a ROM for german speaking region (=50Hz PAL region), but that is causing the audio and movie to be running completely offsync. Selecting 60Hz NTSC in emu config is fixing that problem.<br />Confusingly, the Akira/sd2snes youtube video isn't having those issues. It was probably recorded on a NTSC console (fixing the sync issue). But I don't understand why it doesn't have the volume=00h issue. I thought that the current theory was that MSU1 (and sd2snes) is setting volume=00h upon /reset...?<br />Do you know if the youtube video and download link are both containing the same ROM-image version? And if the youtube video was taken with some newer/older sd2snes firmware version? Maybe some firmwares did initialize the volume differently than others?
