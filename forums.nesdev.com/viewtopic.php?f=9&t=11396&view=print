		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Would it be safe to remove the 7805 IC (because it can only safely regulate power with at least 7 volts) and power my NES directly with an old IBM power supply that outputs 5 volts at 14 amps? I know that the 7805 brings it down to 5VDC and I am pretty sure a PC PSU is well regulated.<br /><br />If you need to know why I want to do this, it is because I have a problem with my everdrive N8, and I want to check if the FPGA on it is simply not receiving enough power. I don't have any wallwarts that provide a decent number of amps to test this theory.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />So what's the rating of your usual power supply?  I always use a 600mA rated one, and have never had a problem.<br /><br />Other than the previously posted warnings, to be safe I'd run it through a fast blow fuse (maybe 1.5A or 2A?).  Not strictly needed, but at 14A I'm thinking a fault would blow the traces right off the board.<br /><br />From what I understand, ATX also supplies standby power at 5V.  So you'd have to use one of the pins on the connector with a switch (or just short it) and also draw some minimum amount of current, but the standby current will always be there.  I don't know what the threshold is, but if the NES was near it, I'd guess that could be bad.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Suspend doesn't draw power from the front +12V and +5V lines, only from +5VSB. Otherwise they couldn't achieve the very low standby power consumption necessary for Energy Star approval when on standby.<br /><br />(Power supplies have a specific amount of power at which they operate at maximum efficiency, and anything above or below that is less efficient. A 400W supply that's providing 2W could well consume 10W or more.)

If that isn't enough then I bet something else is the problem. <br /><br />I use as 3rd party AC adapter that outputs 9VAC at 1.3amps and use the PowerPAK with no problems. I don't have an EverDrive though. I would think it couldn't use that much more power but maybe it does.
