Yeah I can confirm Celius' system is very clever and flexible. You'd want to use white and skin color for the last palette too, because those 2 colors are neeeded. Replacing the gray with orange in the first palette is good as well, depending on what you want to do. The advantage of coming with a constant palette set is that it saves you headaches, and simplify things a lot. Even very advanced games with good graphics like Battletoads &amp; Double Dragon does this.<br /><br />For my system tough I have 3 constant and 1 variable palettes (like the original Battletoads). This has the advantage of allowing more flexibility in enemies' palette swap by using the variable palette.<br /><br />PS : As for dithering, you shold be carefull only to dither colors that are already close enough. If you dither light red and skin color, it will work out to give you some blond. If you dither somehting like skin color and black, it will actually look like a chessboard and won't give you the "dark brown" that averaging both colors would. Even with NTSC filter it looks like a chessboard with diagonl lines going in. The color just won't blend.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=38">Bregalad</a> — Sat Dec 19, 2009 3:41 am</p><hr />

Perhaps you should try something similar to what I've done. I've come up with a system that allows me to make enemies/objects that are a lot of different colors. Take a look at my palettes (the character palette is not included):<br /><br />Note: brightness is indicated by a number 0-3, 0 being darkest, and 3 being the lightest.<br /><br />Palette 1:<br />Color 1 - Black<br />Color 2 - Red 1<br />Color 3 - Grey 2<br /><br />Palette 2:<br />Color 1 - Black<br />Color 2 - Green 1<br />Color 3 - Yellow 2<br /><br />Palette 3:<br />Color 1 - Black<br />Color 2 - Purple 1<br />Color 3 - Blue 2<br /><br />Notice how in the last two palettes, I pair Green with Yellow. If I want to make a yellow enemy, I can make it mostly yellow with green and black shadows. If I want to make a green enemy, I can make it mostly green with black shadows and yellow highlights. Since these two colors can almost be seen as part of the same color scale, they work well together in the same palette, but they're different enough so you can make distinctly green or yellow sprites. The same goes for purple and blue. They are different and similar simultaneously.<br /><br />The first palette is a little different though. With this, I can make grey-scale objects and red objects. Red objects will have grey highlights and black shadows while grey objects will have red and black shadows. It's a little weird for the second one, but it's not that weird. Anyways, the point is I actually have a lot of flexibility with these palettes. If you have a system like this, you could do a little bit of layering with one of these palettes and the character palette, but not be making sacrifices since you're re-using the palettes that you're layering on top of the character's graphics.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=138">Celius</a> — Sat Dec 19, 2009 12:39 am</p><hr />

Well, basically there is 3 ways to draw sprites :<br />- One layer, one palette, limited to 3 colors (usually black + 2 colors). Example : Mario in SMB1 and SMB3, Link, Simon Belmont, FF1 fighter, All sprites of Dragon Warrior games, etc...<br />- One layer, two (or more palettes. Different areas of the sprite uses different palettes. Limited to 5 colors (more precisely 1 + 2n, where n is the amount of paletes) (transparent and black border is shared). Examples : Player 1 in contra, Billy &amp; most enemies in Double Dragon, Black Mage &amp; Thief of FF1, etc...<br />- Two layers, two (or more) palettes. The same area is covered by overlay sprites. (Pratically) not limited in colors, but the 8-sprites per line limitation is the real limit. Example : Mega Man, Rash&amp;Zitz (Battletoads), playable characters in Just Breed, etc...<br /><br />Note : When it comes to designing a character with red trousers and blond hair, I used to use red to represent the blond hair in my game projec,. Dragon Skill, when I figured at a later time that dithering a light red with skin color looked pretty close to blond, which I eventually adopted. I longly hesitated to overlay blond sprite too, but I'd better avoid the flickering this would cause as much as possible.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=38">Bregalad</a> — Fri Dec 18, 2009 2:08 pm</p><hr />

I'd draw that sprite with using two palettes: one with black, white and the skin color and the other with black, red and yellow.

The most common example is Mega Man. Notice how his sprite uses black, blue and cyan for the most part, but his face is skin colored. They do this by placing an extra skin colored sprite with the shape of his face on top of everything (you don't even have to worry about sprite priorities if the shape of the "top" sprite is cut out on the "bottom" sprite).<br /><br />The disadvantage is that the NES has a very low limit of sprites per scanline (only 8), so unless you plan this very well stacking sprites can be a big waste of them that will result in a lot of flickering during the game.<br /><br />I do this for Sonic in the game I'm making, because he definitely needs more than 3 colors to be accurately represented. One "layer" has two blues and white, and the other has reds/skin tones. I try not to use more than 4 sprites in a scanline for Sonic, so that other objects have a fair chance to be displayed. Sometimes I have only 3 in a given scanline, for some of his animation frames I need 5 occasionally, but I always try to keep the count as low as possible when designing the sprites.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=95">tokumaru</a> — Fri Dec 18, 2009 10:03 am</p><hr />
