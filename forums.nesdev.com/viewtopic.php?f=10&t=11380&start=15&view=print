Thanks, Jimmy Dean!</tt> ...but these aren't text articles -- they're essentially technical reference materials.<br /><br />And yeah I know -- it makes the markup significantly more ugly/more annoying to look at/edit, especially if it's data that's imported from a text file or something (I used to have to do this at my old job -- main source was just an ASCII file people edited, so every time someone changed something there, I had to go and manually fix all the words that should have <tt style="margin-left: 2px; margin-right: 2px; padding:3px; background-color: #3355aa; color: white;">[[</tt> and <tt style="margin-left: 2px; margin-right: 2px; padding:3px; background-color: #3355aa; color: white;">]]</tt> around them.

I think I fixed that in the past. &quot;F&quot; means Fixed.

Most of the other mappers provide an easily-summarised set of functionality.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">I'm happy either way?

I didn't realise there was so much variance between board types.  Good lord!  I'm thinking a good starting point would be to migrate the data <a href="http://wiki.nesdev.com/w/index.php/Comparison_of_Nintendo_mappers" class="postlink">from here</a> into <a href="http://wiki.nesdev.com/w/index.php/List_of_mappers" class="postlink">this page</a> (which isn't your responsibility lidnariq :-) ), but then somehow work <a href="http://wiki.nesdev.com/w/index.php/User:Lidnariq/MMC3_Variants" class="postlink">this data</a> into that same page, although that's a tremendous project.  It might be easiest to just take the data from your MMC3 Variants page and put it into separate section(s).<br /><br />P.S. -- I have no idea what &quot;outer banks&quot; refers to in the &quot;Mappers with outer banks&quot; section.  Maybe a little preface/explanation in a paragraph above the table would suffice.  (I took a look at mapper 14 and I guess it's like a &quot;dual-mode mapper&quot; where in one mode it acts like a particular existing mapper, while in another mode it acts like something completely different.  Weird...)

It is just another form of CHR bank switching, except it affects $2000-$2fff instead of the more normal $0000-$1fff zone. It is not more complicated than TLSROM boards for instance.
