		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I was curious about the how far along the development of MMC5 with new flash carts and boards. To my knowledge, none of the existing devices available are able to replicate the MMC5 yet. I have a translation in progress of a 1MB PRG-ROM, 512kb CHR-ROM MMC5 game and to my knowledge it's not playable on hardware with existing hardware/devices. Using an existing board as a donor does not appear it would work, and I am perfectly content with that. <br /><br />So I was just wondering if MMC5 support was coming soon or not.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Between the part where the PowerPak and Everdrive N8 only have 512KiB for PRG-ROM emulation, and the part where the MMC5 is a sufficiently complex beast that I strongly suspect that it can't fit in its entirety into INL's dual-XC9572L boards. If you know what subset of the MMC5 the game uses ... well, INL already answered. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br />That said, it looks to me like the InviteNES might have 2MiB for both PRG and CHR? (<a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/viewtopic.php?f=9&amp;t=8781" class="postlink">their announcement to this forum</a>, see the two ICs labelled &quot;R1LV1616RSA&quot;) I don't know if they've changed that; it's an obvious place to cut costs.

As far as I know all of these worked.<br /><br />Just Breed doesn't use much scanline counting effects, but CV3 does, and it works fine as well.<br /><br />I think the only thing that may have gone unimplemented without breaking games is vertical split-screen scroll. Only Uchuu Keibitai SDF uses this. One would have to check how well it work on the power pak.

From what I can see, it has good graphics (probably uses ExGraphics), but all you need for that is a good artist.

I don't know much other than it has a complex scripting system which makes translation easy in a way, that the cartridge was 8 mbits, and that the graphics and animations are really kickass.

Because SRAM bankswitching is, as far as I know, the only thing Koei games uses and that Just Breed doesn't.<br />I might be wrong - this is pure speculation, but that'd make sense.

(It also uses the keyboard, but that isn't a part of the mapper.)
