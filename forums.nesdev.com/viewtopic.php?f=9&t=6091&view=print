		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Hey all, I'm fairly new around here so first off I'd like to thank this community for its wealth of knowledge in all things NES dev. I have three 'toaster' NES systems and one does not work, so I would like to do the infamous DVD player mod. I have a small Coby DVD player that's PCBs and drive can fit inside the NES control deck quite easily. Of course every mod will be different because every DVD player is different, but I have a few general questions I'm hoping that someone who has maybe made an NES dvd player themselves can help with. 
<br />
<br />
<br />1. If possible, I would like to keep the NES Power/Reset button assembly intact and provide both power and dvd tray eject. I know the NES power button is a latching push button and the Reset button is a common momentary push button. On most DVD players the power button is a momentary push button, but I'm not sure about mine. Is there a way to tell if my Coby DVD player's power button is a latch button? If it isn't, I will need to know if there is a way to modify the NES power button from a latching button to a momentary push button. 
<br />
<br />
<br />2. What should I use/what is the best way to keep components in place, espically the drive? The only thing I can think of is hot glue and I'd need quite a bit to do all this.  
<br />
<br />3. I would like to hide the IF remote sensor in one of the pins of controller port 2 Is there enough space to do that? and will the remote be able to receive the signal well enough though such a small hole? 
<br />
<br />4. I would like to be able to use controller port 1 to accept an actual NES controller and interact with the DVD player as well. I realize this means removing the 4021 and since I want more than four inputs, the cord as well. Does anyone have advice for this aspect? 
<br />
<br />5. Any other advice? Thanks!

<br />
<br />1- almost all modern consumer electronics use "soft on" with momentary buttons to power up. however, the test is: is the button in a different position after you press it once? If not, it's momentary.
<br />
<br />2- It is possible to modify most plunger toggle buttons to behave like momentaries. In the case of the NES (looking at mine) it should involve removing the little copper tongue and wire underneath it so that the two buttons look the same on top.

<br />
<br />And to KIS you could just take an extra reset switch and change out the plastic face button with the one from the power button. Save messing around with the guts of the switch.

<br />
<br />Desoldering two switches and swapping them is pretty simple,but looking more closely at the power button, removing the toggle-ness is really 10 seconds with a pair of needle-nose pliers. 
<br />
<br />1- remove the button face
<br />2- grab the copper retaining clip, pull it forward parallel towards where the button face was
<br />3- grab the little wire inside, pull it up and out
<br />4- replace the button face.

<br />
<br />The specific model is Coby DVD288 1080p Upconversion DVD Player With HDMI. 
<br />
<br />Here's some information about the power button that might prove useful: 
<br />
<br />Unlike the NES power button, the Coby's power button doesn't seem to have two rest states. In other words, when the NES is on, the power button is clicked inward and is clearly different from the Reset button. On the Coby, the power button returns to the same location when its on as when its off. 
<br />
<br />The Coby has two sets of power LEDs to indicate if the system is on or not. When the system is on, the LEDs turn blue, but when they are off the LEDs remain red, unless the DVD player is unplugged of course. 
<br />
<br />Based on the lack of two different phsyical states, am I correct in assuming that the Coby uses a typical momentary push button and not the latch style button that the NES uses?

<br />
<br />To heck with the PCB traces, just run some krynar from the contacts to the DVD pcb. It is pretty simple.

Any wire should work for the power source given that the player probably uses a somewhat small AC adapter. Kynar is just a nice type of wire to have when working with modchi...patchwork. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">SatoshiMatrix wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">...Contact Cement do the trick?</div>
<br />If it's non-conductive, yes. I'd personally recommend super glues with long cure times, like Elmer's Ultimate, Duco Cement, or Liquid Nails. Use pens/pencils as spacers and glop the glue in the corners. Theese types of glue are good here since the cure time prevents any major damage from cyanocrylate...the stuff that makes krazy glue work well.
<br />
<br />You may also try <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vulcanization#Vulcanization_of_silicones" class="postlink">RTV silicone</a>, but I myself have had mixed results.
