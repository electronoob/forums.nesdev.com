<br />
<br />Heck, none support processor sound too AFAIK. All that's emulated is the APU. Hence no SPC rips of games that require the main CPU unit - Lost Vikings, FEDA, Furai no Shiren, a few more.

<br />Either that or everything is taken care of in the SNES CPU and then it just streams the sound over to the spc-700?
<br />
<br />edit:
<br />or maybe the SGB takes care of the sound and pass it on to the spc-700 through the cpu?

<br />
<br />Today, when I tried to add the track number into the playlist in the gbs, it played way too fast, and it lead me to discover a very beginner error I made... I set the timer interrupt speed wrong (exactly copying the byte from the debugger without masking out the bits that are unused. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" />), which actually made the entire gbs play at the wrong speed, so to compensate, I played around with the reload counter until the speed sounded right... yeah. So to fix this gbs, I masked out the unused bits in the control register, and set the reload value to what gets set in the game. For some reason, DK will change the reload value when it plays the credits song to make it play slower, and with the borked control byte I had, it made it play much too fast, so I think that's why I left it out of the gbs in the first place. Sorry about that.
<br />
<br />You can get the updated gbs at my site. Sorry if I neglected to tackle this issue sooner. :S

<br />Gaussian interpolation, not cubic interpolation.

<br />I agree, since that makes a lot of sense.
<br />
<br />The SGB does send commands to the SPC700, but only for real SNES-generated sound (not for the main Game Boy sound).
