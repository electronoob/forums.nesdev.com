<br />
<br />But there's one reason for doing this: After that, I will (or might, if I have the time) to try to make a hardware NES project using ''Quazar SID interface'', ''HardSID'' or something like that. It is to benefit making and listening music and/or port games to C64 and back.
<br />
<br />What do you think, Should I do this addition to the family of extra famicom sound? Vote Here

This creates unique distortion effects that can't quite seem to be matched digitally.  That's part of what makes the SID so pleasing on original hardware.

<br />
<br />Actually, That is not really true, I can buy the required HardSID components and hack/rewire the NES (or a ***SMB1 Cartridge) to use it for extended sound. Just needs *two audio plugs/red jacks. **One of which go from extended audio to the HardSID, then another jack to the TV
<br />
<br />Notes to Self:
<br />
<br />***  = Adding the Great Giana Sisters music to SMB1 will be possible as there is a SID disassembler at the goattracker homepage (Goattracker is a good SID tracker!) 
<br />
<br />**  = 1 jack if mono, 2 red jacks if stereo. Recommended amount is 2
<br />
<br />*   = 2 jacks if mono, 4 red jacks if stereo. Recommended amount is 4
<br />
<br />EDIT: Typo fixed

<br />My point is that as C64 computers get "used up" for their SID chips, this will become more and more expensive. Or when did they restart production on SID chips?

<br />
<br />Appearently, Wikipedia says HardSID and/or some (but not all) similar SID-related (non-C64) hardware used a replica or a reforge (as in NES-on-a-Chip style, but is not a on-a-Chip at all, just simply remade), That may or may not be true. It can be the truth though,

<br />
<br />Also, even if it lacks filters and have less duty cycles available and less bits for frequency controls, the NES sound chip has one more channel and more flexible volume control. So the gain for doing this is so-so.

I guess the GT dissasembler would help with this? If I could run progs from Goattracker on NES, that would be cool, but midiBox sid already can do this.
<br />
<br />There are alot of good SID hardware applications out there (midiBox for instance) already. So I don't know how useful an NesSID application would be to musicians. 
<br />
<br />Also, a SID-like substitute, if real chips do get hard to find:

<br />
<br />The procedure doesn't render the C64 unworkable. It is nested in a socket, on the motherboard. You can always put in another SID.

So there would be no need for emulation.  But you don't necessarily need a 6502 to interface with the SID.  What does need to be considered is that the SID was only designed to operate at 1MHz.  Any faster and you'll fry the chip.  At least as far as real, physical SID chips are concerned.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">tepples wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">I was just worried that accuracy of the reproduction chips might have fallen to NOAC levels.</div>
<br />Yeah, they can't quite reproduce the filters of the original 6581.  The later revision SIDs are another story, but they're quite honestly inferior.  They wouldn't really add anything to the NES's sound capabilities that hasn't already been done on the VRC6 or Namcot 106, for example.  If there's going to be a clone that replaces the SID, it's going to have to be able to replace the original analog filters and distortion.  Just my thoughts.

<br />
<br />Because of that. I will not bother with the upcoming project and to not do it at all, I am letting Memblers do the Squeedo project instead. As It sounds more possible to program and as he said, sounds similar to a SID. and does not require the extra crap to make the mess that I would have made.

<br />BTW: The project was not a joke, just was in concept stages until it was abandoned by me,
