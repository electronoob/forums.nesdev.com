<br />Man, you're really not helping with your not-so-subtle jabs. Tepples is trying to get everyone involved in this, so at least he is trying to make a step forward here. I mean, nesdev hasn't been a huge place that always bans people. It just seems that recently there is more of a flux of people that are... hmmm... time wasters? I'm not sure, but I don't think Memblers did a whole lot of banning when he wasn't so busy, either, did he?
<br />
<br />If we're gonna do a thing like "quote and say strike," I highly recommend this is done via PM, and not in the threads. That would only lead to more flaming and ignorance that doesn't need to be on here.
<br />
<br />Basically, if Tepples would like to take measures via PMs from people about different topics/posts before initiating a ban on someone, then I see nothing wrong with this. Roll with it and see what happens, what's it going to hurt?
<br />
<br />EDIT: haha Tepples beat me to the PM idea : P

<br />Links are bad only when, well, they link to bad stuff. "Bad stuff" would be pirated software (including ROMs), porn, viruses, ads that are not relevant, and crap like that.
<br />
<br />The rule you quoted was meant to keep spam bots away, because they often only register to promote something. Disallowing linking for guests and users with few posts would cause the bots to fail promoting whatever they are trying to.
<br />
<br />Every legitimate user can post links, if the linked content is relevant to the other users of the board.

<br />I have a horrible time trying to discern if you're either sarcastic, serious, or a combination of both.  :-)  I chuckled regardless.
<br />
<br />No, our only presence is in the United States -- I don't have any plans on relocating to another country nor placing servers in non-US countries -- so you're free to link/discuss/put up whatever you'd like.

<br />Thanks. I can't give away too many details just yet. In the past, I've announced several projects too early; all ended up abandoned before becoming playable.
