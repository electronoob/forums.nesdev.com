Make sure pin 1 of that oscillator isn't an enable input or anything.  if it's NC I suggest connecting it to VCC because it's a positive output enable on a lot of models, but check the data sheets to be sure.

I'll make the minor change of hooking it up to VCC, though the datasheet says it doesn't <em>really</em> need it because of an internal pullup. I made a major change to the design to remap the YMZ to $4400 and $4401 at the request of nitro2k01. A0 is now actually A0, and the 138's been wired from A10 to A15 so I hope that's right. I also made the minor addition of two spots to wire up some pots for bias/gain control, again at the request of nitro2k01. If everything's all clear, I'll order all the parts and boards when I'm next free. <br /><img src="https://my.mixtape.moe/ibwvyh.png" alt="Image" /><br />EDIT: And I just realized I connected Y0 to /CS instead of Y1. I keep forgetting the first pin is VCC and not an output pin.

But if you're not using schematic capture to wire everything up first, I strongly recommend doing that on future projects. It'll help prevent silly mistakes.

But if you put the registers at $4400-$47FF, that'll overlap with the MBC register at $4000-$5FFF...</div><br />That is intentional. The point is to <strong>avoid</strong> for example $6000-$7FFF which may have different functionality on different flashcarts precisely because it's mostly unused otherwise. $4000-$4FFF on the other hand has a behavior that's both predictable between various cart hardware and mostly non-destructive. Yes, the SRAM bank register will be changed by writing to $4400, but this can easily be restored by writing the desired bank value to $4000 which will also not affect the sound chip.
