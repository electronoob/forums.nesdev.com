It's for the slightly advanced user though, as figuring out how to create instruments can be tricky. Also you should know how to "track" (the process of creating tracked module files like S3M, IT, XM, etc)
<br />
<br />EDIT: Hmm Well it seems I figured out how to make a multiple NSF with all the S3M's into one big NSF.. think I should do one last release? <img src="./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" /> heh

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Okay, just tried this pack. Most of the songs are more or less correct, with issues mostly involving volume/enveloping of notes
<br />
<br />But of the ones I've scrutinized particularly is wily stage 2, which has some relatively major issues:
<br />(when i say patterns i'm talking about the source s3m in the zip file)
<br />for patterns 0 thru 8 and 17 thru 22, channel 1 should be using sample 01 not 02 (12.5% duty cycle, not 25%)
<br />for patterns 23 thry 25, channel 2 should be using 12.5% duty cycle BUT the notes currently in channels 1 and 2 are at least partly wrong. I'm not well versed in music theory but I believe there's supposed to be a harmonic relationship between those two channels different from the one thats there now. Also the volume of channel 2 is too high for that section.
<br />
<br />There may also be some missing 12.5% issues on patterns 9 thru 16 as well but I can't clearly hear it in the source/original video.
<br />
<br />I'm using the video at <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DH0lpUNWGEY&amp;fmt=18">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DH0lpUNWGEY&amp;fmt=18</a><!-- m --> as a 'source'.
<br />Note that its possible capcom or someone else screwed up the duty cycle on the OST cd. I personally do not trust the ost cd due to added postprocessing such as echo and reverb on some songs.
<br />
<br />The most authentic source would be for someone to disassemble the actual tracker/player used on the wii/xbox/ps3 to play the music direct from data files. 
<br />OR much easier: someone could just hack the wii/etc version to only play one channel of each song at once by hacking the code from the sound engine which tells the music engine when to mask one channel when a sound effect happens. Then record each of the 4 channels separately at high quality, and figure out the exact parameters and stuff from the recording. (I know capcom/ict when to a lot of trouble to implement that masking feature, so its only fitting we abuse the hell out of it in a way it wasn't meant to be used) Someone really needs to do that.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Actually that's what happened, the duty cycle in the game is different than the one in the soundtrack.. that's why the latest NSF file actually has "two" versions of that song. As for the wrong notes, I dunno.. I listened to it very carefully, especially at 1/4th speed, 1/2th speed, and even sometimes at 2x speed just to make sure I had some of the tom slides starting/ending at the right frequency.
<br />
<br />As for the actual volume, you can't really judge with the MP3's or the YouTube video because the dynamic range in Capcom's sound system compared to the dynamic range of the NES is so different. (and I'm not just talking about the fact that it's got 16 volume instances, I mean actual dynamic range) ...The NES has barely any dynamic range where Capcom's system .. well let's face it, it sounds fantastic compared to Capcoms. Plus, I'm also only Human..it's sad to think, yes, I know. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" />
<br />
<br />Yeah I just checked the notes. They're all right. I think it's because of the 12.5% duty being used instead of the 25% duty which changes the harmonic relationship between the notes.
<br />
<br />Check wilystg2_st.s3m to see if there's much difference.. I'm assuming you're looking at the latest S3Ms? <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://tssf.gamemusic.ca/Remakes/GIBStuff/tssf_mm9_nsfs.zip">http://tssf.gamemusic.ca/Remakes/GIBStu ... 9_nsfs.zip</a><!-- m --> &lt;- this is the latest one (I've updated the archive a few times, the latest one doesn't have the NSF/NSFE directories since I've since compiled multi-nsfs)
<br />
<br />Thanks for your analysis!

<br />Latest nsf version it sounds fine.
<br />
<br />Other minor quips: the original and ost has a less severe volume envelope on the super-short notes on the boss battle theme (and in a few other places I can't think of atm), but it may be impossible to replicate that on the nes. as you said.
<br />
<br />Btw if there's one song you should redo as mml in famitracker, it should be that completely insane 'maze of death' one, just to prove that it can be done in MML.

I refuse to believe Maze of Death though wasn't at least designed in a sequencer before re-written in MML though. The song is way too complex to be completely written in only MML, and ...yeah. I just refuse to believe it's possible for someone to do that song in pure scripting language without working from a reference. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" />
<br />
<br />Thanks for your comments, it's nice to see someone actually going to great lengths to analyze it.

<br />
<br />That's what I meant - to redo the songs as mml in famitracker. ^_^
<br />
<br />EDIT: My my... that file <a href="http://tssf.gamemusic.ca/temp/test.nsf" class="postlink">test.nsf</a> is the Rush Jet theme. It's <strong>thousand</strong> times better and flawless, unlike the version in the nsf package.

<br />Thanks for this release.  I will be studying the instruments since I always want to know how to make the same sound as well known songs.

<br />
<br />If someone can make a music system that can create music for existing megaman games and swap out the music for custom music, then I may consider remaking actual MM9 songs with macro instrumentation..but at the moment, the S3M's are the best way to hear them.
<br />
<br />It'd be nice if those guys who are doing the NES version of Rockman 8 would use my S3M files for a Rockman 9 PC remake, too. Probably won't happen, though. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />
