I doubt it's a region lock for several reasons, my guess is that Tepples is right, or at least on the right track.  All 3 controllers work fine on an NTSC console. it's only the PAL console that has issues with out-of-region controllers (at least USA controller/PAL console, I've never tried JPN controller/PAL console).<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=5348">qwertymodo</a> — Thu Jan 08, 2015 4:50 pm</p><hr />

They're priced that way because that's what people are willing to pay.  I know, it sounds crazy, but step back and think about it.  Pick any kind of &quot;niche&quot; thing and you'll find it overpriced on eBay.  I'm not even sure how many examples I want to list here, but based on experience those include Famicom games, Famicom Disk System games, Famicom systems, arcade PCBs, SNES AC adapters (original Nintendo branded, not replicas or third-party), blah blah blah.<br /><br />Equally as bad, right now SNES/SFC stuff is a current hipster trend in the US, which means the price of everything related shoots up simply because eBay sellers know people will pay.  The economics really is that simple.  There's a lot of insight given to this model/methodology by Pat the NES Punk, and covered in a lot of his Youtube videos, where he also disclosed that the eBay &quot;pricing model&quot; has for some time affected flea market prices as well, where people will put out console stuff at a flea market with no price tags on it and when you ask how much it is, use their mobile phones to look up the current general price of it on eBay and then quote you that (or sometimes higher).<br /><br />There is more than a cosmetic difference though: the X and Y buttons on the US SNES controller are concave, while on the SFC they're convex.  (Trust me -- I have both types sitting here next to me).  I don't know about the PAL SNES controllers.<br /><br />If your only interest is the cosmetics, then here are your options:<br /><br />a) Buy a SFC controller and then purchase a controller extension cable (they're still made an inexpensive).  You shouldn't have length/transmission/signalling issues because the extension cables are actually intended for use with SNES controllers, which already have fairly long cables; the SFC controller cables are shorter, as you know.<br /><br />Alternately, if you have a SNES controller already, just swap out the controller cables.  They're actually &quot;socketed&quot;, or more specifically they have little connectors on them, so you can exchange the longer SNES one with the SFC one without having to do any kind of cable modification.<br /><br />b) Assuming you're willing to bend on the SNES logo colour, then buy some SFC controllers and use the buttons in a SNES (US) control pad.  The controllers all have standard Philips screws and the buttons can be swapped out between the two types.<br /><br />c) Again assuming you're willing to bend on the logo colour, have a plastics shop make you replacement buttons of the exact size and colour you want (you'll probably need a Pantone colour chart/swatch).  It's best if you give them originals to clone (i.e. give them buttons to an SFC controller).<br /><br />d) Shell out the cash for a PAL SNES controller.<br /><br />Honestly (a) is the easiest and most economical (assuming what you said about cost was true), considering (b) and likely (c) would require you to have an SFC controller already.  The Super Famicom controller pair I purchased off eBay wasn't $5: it was around $40 including shipping.<br /><br />Me?  I spend more time looking at the TV/monitor of the game I'm playing than I do the colours of the pads and buttons.  :-)  The concave vs. convex feel to the buttons, though, does matter more than you think (esp. when you're used to one or the other).<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3">koitsu</a> — Wed Jan 07, 2015 3:55 pm</p><hr />

Is there any real reason why PAL Controllers are so impossible to find for sale, and when they are, they're like $40-50?  On any given day, I can find 20 pages of US controllers for $10-15ish in good condition on Ebay, same with the SFC version, but only like 1 or 2 listings for PAL ones (and yes, I'm searching worldwide).  Is there maybe a better place to find them?  Of the 3 designs (JPN/USA/PAL), the PAL version is my favorite, as it has the multi-colored buttons like the SFC, but it has the 6-foot cable and says Super Nintendo instead of Super Famicom.  Also, the Super Nintendo logo is dark and bold instead of the light and faded color on the USA version.  But yeah, I'm not paying $50 + shipping for a controller.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=5348">qwertymodo</a> — Tue Jan 06, 2015 2:35 pm</p><hr />
