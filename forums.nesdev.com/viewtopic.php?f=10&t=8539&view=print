		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I have managed to make a background for my pong with the nerdy method.It looks great on screen but the code is a hudge mess.
<br />
<br />So i was interrested in making it cleaner in my code .
<br />Looked around on the forum and read topics like the background saga,understanding backgrounds etc.
<br />
<br />I experimented with it and some things i like and some things i don't.
<br />
<br />For ugrading my background i went with this :
<br />
<br />-addr lo+high (variables)
<br />-changing background 1,2,3,4 into the loop code.
<br />
<br />-in other exsamples i also see .pal a incbin for the pallete but im not really bothered by that code so i want to leave it in.
<br />
<br />-the attribute doesnt bother me also.
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />So in short.
<br />
<br />1.i got rid of loading the background 4 times But i have to set LDX # and LDY # i have to look this up for getting a complete background.
<br />
<br />2.How does the .map file work? I gues this is where the huge .db code is stored but how do you set this and wich program do you use?
<br />
<br />3.Google or searcing BACKGROUND on the forum gives 1000+ results so if somebody knows good sites/links for detailed reads and information i would be very interrested.
<br />
<br />4.Im jumping way ahead here but im curious what is the turning point for incbin? With a short game with titlescreen/credits/rules/game over and playing im guesing you would program with a couple of incbin screens,but how do many screens get stored not incbin i gues?

<br />.incbin(for NESASM at least) means "include binary file".Binary file can be anything-Music, DPCM samples, Graphics, Name Tables, metatiles data, even code!(though it's not practical, I guess) How many screens fits into incbin? You mean binary file? Binary file can be as big as you want.(but please remember that NES can only "see" 32kb)

I've included a compressor and NES decompressor for the PackBits RLE format with both my old Allegro-based nametable editor (which Denine mentioned) and the newer Python-based one that's bundled with <a href="http://pineight.com/croom/" class="postlink">Concentration Room</a> and <a href="http://pineight.com/nes/#thwaite" class="postlink">Thwaite</a>.

<br />
<br />I thought this would be easy like draw it in YY or p8nes and push MS DOS BATCHFILE and it would create a .map or other file that i could use as a incbin.
<br />
<br />ok 1 .I found NAME i put it in a map with alleg42.dll and im LOST i looked in neswiki but this section is empty..so how do i use this what should i put in my map etc.
