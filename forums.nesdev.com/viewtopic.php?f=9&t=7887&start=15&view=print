<br />
<br />No, that will not work.  If you lined up the middle perfectly, meaning pin 18, then 11 away from it in either direction you will have a shift of 11 * 0.04 = 0.44mm.  That is a total shift from pin 7 to 29 of 0.88, which is too much.   Remember, the error is in the same direction on both sides.  Ben Heck got around this by splitting the connector in half, thereby sending half the error to the left and half to the right, which does work.  That is also the way your picture above is drawn (error to left of arrows accumulating to left, error on the right accumulating to the right).

So you're unable to slid the cart fully to the left and create the scenario seen in the picture you show.<br /><br />To prove it to myself I place a board with all 72 contacts removed from the case in my connector.  Then I tested for continuity and shorting between pins on both sides and the center while the board was slid from side to side.  By testing in this manner I can rule out the argument that my cart isn't using all the pins.  Now I didn't test every single pin in every single position because that I'd still be testing.  But I did test the extremes that have the best chance of causing issues.  If I didn't already have everything assembled I would be willing to do more tests to further prove things if someone desired.  If I buy more connectors in the future I will most likely do such just to prove even more so for myself.<br /><br />The only real way I see problems arising is if certain carts have different lengths of the board edge.  If the board was small enough you may be able short pins together or lose contact.  One could go through and measure various carts with a caliper if they were that concerned.<br /><br />As an aside I'm not necessarily trying to prove you "wrong" I agree there is potential for issues with these connectors.  And if you don't want to use them I'm not going to lose any sleep.  It's not like I'm trying to sell them to anyone.  After buying them I everyone informed me they wouldn't work and gave evidence on paper that they wouldn't.  At the time I regretted buying them and expected to return them.   But with some simple testing with the actual hardware I couldn't find any actual problems.  Personally I'm thrilled with them and very thankful that I actually tested things out and found a solution for at least myself, if no one wants to agree with my results that's fine.  They can continue to search for a solution.</div>
<br />Only having 0.19" (0.48mm) of play is good.  The "sweet spot" where the contention is in the middle of the board is 4 pins wide, or 4 * 2.5mm = 10mm.  So you have a 10mm range in which the contention is occurring on the unused expansion pins, so it shouldn't be too hard to place the cart in this range - and it sounds like mechanically your connector prevents it from going outside this range.  That's good news.
<br />You still seem to be claiming that your connector doesn't have any contentions.  That I do not believe, the math proves it to be impossible, regardless of what your multimeter says <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />.  I certainly trust the math more than your experimentation.  I don't say this to be rude, it's just that math doesn't lie and therefore I cannot trust your experiment.
<br />However, I readily admit that it is possible that my math is flawed.  My diagram shows two pcb edges, it does NOT show the connector itself.  The metal on the connector is probably a little narrower than the trace on the PCB, which might impact the calculation.  Of course the pitch cannot be different, so contention is still unavoidable - but it might not be exactly every 22 pins.  It is also possible that the space between the traces on the pcb edge are not exactly 0.882mm as I have on my diagram.  Again, this could throw off the "22 pin" number - but ultimately does not avoid the problem.
<br />Having admitted the math could be  flawed, I invite someone to show where it is wrong!  You're counter argument is "the connector works", which even if it is true - does not shine any light onto how that could be possible.
<br />I'm glad that your adapter is working for you, it's not my intention to argue about it.  I'm simply trying to get at the truth and to document the reason behind the limitations of using the 2.54mm adapters.
<br />I have an order to place at digikey soon anyway, maybe I'll throw one of these in so I can verify myself.  Or I could dig out the one I bought 8 years ago from digikey, maybe it shrank a bit while resting in the closet <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />

He also posted a picture of an NES clone with a cart in it, and the connector pitch clearly didn't match the cart.  For all we know, every NES clone could be using the wrong pitch and that's why the PowerPak doesn't work (maybe it also doesn't work on a 60-pin clone with an adapter, I don't know).  Not having an NES clone, or NES-to-FC adapter, I can only speculate.
<br />
<br />I'm making an NES cartridge that does use the expansion pins, and I will be a little peeved if that stops it from working in clone systems.  It's hard to believe, seems like there must be some kind of consequence.  Maybe I can make the pin thinner or in a different position or something, would be kind of a lame solution though.
<br />
<br />And this is how stuff gets discovered, by people not knowing that something is supposed to be impossible. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" />

I'm really not sure where all your numbers are coming from.  Those 1.651 and 1.618mm measurements correspond to nothing physical with NES carts or these connectors.  I measure cart contacts as around 1.9mm wide, it's not the easiest thing to measure but I'm not off by .4mm, also my pins on the connector are 1.37mm wide not your 1.618mm<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">teaguecl wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">However, I readily admit that it is possible that my math is flawed.

<br />
<br />You're right about this...
<br />
<br />Your picture with pins 1 perfectly aligned and pins 36 and 35 halfway overlapping is PHYSICALLY impossible with this connector and standard NES carts.  With only 0.019" (0.48mm) of free play means that the cart can only fall .24mm off center.  
<br />
<br />
<br />You're drawing shows the cart having 2.88mm of free play 
<br />72*(2.54-2.50mm)
<br />You're allowing the cart to fall 1.44mm off center which is a "mathematical" error of 500%
<br />
<br />You can draw everything much math as you want but really the measurement comes so close that you can't say without  doubt what will happen.  Mainly because having the slack, trace, or pin widths off by a 0.01mm makes or breaks the final answer.  Especially since the pins have some curvature to them so they aren't making physical contact on their extreme edges.
<br />
<br />Now I will point out some assumptions that I have made that may cause issues.
<br />
<br />*Width off cart traces and connector pin width.  If these were to be different for things like the powerpak, unofficial carts, or other female connectors you may very well have issues.
<br />
<br />*Cart wear.  I did some more testing with other carts.  Turns out I was actually able to ground out PRG A11 with one of my carts.  It's a heavily worn SMB3.  It took me awhile to realize why that cart had issues the others didn't.  The reason was because of wear.  The cart actually had enough wear to slide far enough to cause that issue.  But I placed the board inside the case and inserted it like it normall would be into the NES.  The only way I was able to get the pins to short was prying (and holding) it over with a screw driver.  The lessened clearance caused by using the case forced the cart back over when I released my screw driver.  I had to be actively applying the force to cause problems.
<br />
<br />I could see if a cart were in REALLY bad shape you could have more issues.
<br />
<br />* proper alignment on the NES motherboard.  Like I've stated before there is more slack with this connection and it's easier to cause problems.  With my homemade 72 pin connector properly aligned during install has no issues.
<br />
<br />In conclusion, I agree these connectors aren't perfect.  However in my opinion they're a pretty damn good solution considering what other options are out there.  Especially when doing a project like a cart dumper or programmer when you'd rather not sacrifice a toploader to get a easy to manage female cart connector.  Ben Heck's solution is even better if you're concerned, and you can't argue, Ben's a genius.

<br />
<br />While I frown on the idea of using a 2.54mm pitch connector to interface with an NES cartridge,  it is most likely working because the contact fingers on the connector are quite a bit smaller footprint than the edge connector pins on the cartridges.  The error accumulates, but the footprint on the fingers is small enough that it still works.
<br />
<br />I still think it'll be fiddly and non-optimal, but it will *probably* work.  Most of the time.   This is why I personally don't like the idea of using the 2.54mm pitch connectors.  It will indeed work but there will be cases where it most likely is not going to work.  This could be bad news on a cartridge dumper that has a new mapper you're trying to reverse engineer.  Is it the cart?  The mapper? The connector?

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I hate to bring up this thread again - let me start by saying I don't mean for the tone to be negative.<br />I was thinking about doing a project this weekend, so I dug up my old connector from Digikey and double checked it.  It in fact does not work.<br />Below is a photo of a ruler, a Super Mario board, and two 2.54mm pitch connectors.  The black one is removed from a 60 pin famicom adapter I purchased, the blue one is from Digikey (specifically it is a Sullins EZC36DRXH).<br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/477050/IMG_2774.JPG">https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/477050/IMG_2774.JPG</a><!-- m --><br /><br />I took my old drawing from earlier in this thread, and updated it with the exact dimensions of all three of these parts - and they do not line up.  So I placed the board partially into the Sullins connector and took this photo:<br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/477050/nes_edge.jpg">https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/477050/nes_edge.jpg</a><!-- m --><br /><br />You can clearly see that pin 1 is dangerously close to touching pin 2.  I checked with a multimeter, and it is not.  If you follow left to right, you can see the error accumulating - but all pins look pretty safe, until around pin 30.  By pin 32 it's pretty clear that there are overlaps.  I checked with a multimeter, and to no surprise pins 32, 33, 34, 35, 36 are all shorted together (and correspondingly 37-41 are also shorted).  There is absolutely no way for this connector to work.  So I was right <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />However, as KH points out - it is possible for a connector of the wrong pitch to work.  In order for this to happen, it would need narrower pins (and therefore wider gaps) than the Sullins EZC36DRXH that I have.  It is completely believable that the connectors infiniteneslives purchased are exactly that, and are functional.  Digikey actually sells several different 2.54mm, 72 pin edge connectors.  So while I was right, I was also wrong - and a little bit of a jerk while I was at it.<br /><br />IL, is there any chance you can provide the exact model of the part you have?  The link you posted earlier in this thread has gone stale.

Going for two years strong now in my NES, and dozens of kazzo's across the globe.  My NES has taken quite a bit of abuse over the past two years.  It's probably mated well over 1000 times, including most (ALL?) pirate, unlicensed, and homebrew carts.  I'd never go back to my original/official NES ZIF connector especially when most the cart I plug in don't have a case to hold them down.  I just plug a bare PCB in and play, nothing but love.

But they can probably be found individually for $5, $7 or something.  What's cool too is that they had all 7 wires included (at least the ones I'd gotten).<br /><br />As for the DB-15, I don't have a legit Famicom to try it with, but if it's anything like the Atari DB9's, it's not as easy as one would hope.  Basically, the standard DB9/DB15 female connecters that I know of are made with a flange that would prevent it from being plugged in fully.  It needs to go in far enough for the pins to connect.  If you've tried one, I'd like to know what part it is, if it's any different from the usual ones.  Maybe the best lead I found was Tototek selling Neo-Geo controller extension cables (DB15), but they were a discontinued item by the time I found it.

Chances are that if a cartridge is being reverse-engineered, like an interesting pirate, it probably came in the 60-pin form anyway.

An adapter can be used if it is necessary to use 72-pins cartridges but I intended to make some using 60-pins.
