<br />Whoa, that game looks so much like Street Fighter II! If they can get away with it, I sure can make a game starring "Phonic the Porcupine".

I'd have to look at the specific patents Nintendo has for the latter. <br /><br />I also disagree strongly with GNU's assertion that they have no common factors and should be treated as fully separate entities. To say they have nothing in common is wrong. By analogy, the term property shouldn't exist. The parcel of rights bestowed for ownership of land, ownership of a corporation and ownership of a painting are completely different as well, but all are considered property.<br /><br />Even their history of it is inaccurate. Yes, IP laws in their earliest form were brought for to protect the best interest of the public, not the IP holder. This was because it was presumed that prior to the laws, that creators had a natural right of ownership. These restriction are analogous to many physical property rights such as the restrictions created by heritage building laws, or right of first refusal on sales.<br /><br />As for theft versus infringement, you're right. I choose a loaded term which is not accurate in this situation and I apologize.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">unless the game is fully homebrew.

<br />While not all clones infringe, in this case they took the name, the game design and the level design from the original Game &amp; Watch. The Capcom v. Data East case specifically differentiates between cloned elements which are not protected by copyright, and those which are. This would likely have elements that would be deemed protected by copyright, and thus would be infringing.

<br />Taking the name? Nintendo might have a case. But what about the level design?

The requirements to be deemed new are inadequate, and the definition of derivative has become too broad.<br /><br />That's not even attempting to address the fact that I like some derivative works, such as Mario Adventure, which could never be legal.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">Taking the name?

<br />
<br />The level design by itself would not be viewed as infringement, but it would be considered when determining whether or not the NES game should be considered a derivative work with regards to copyright.
