I know it is the Super Famicom's illegitimate child (it even inherited the controller) and the story about the Nintendo PlayStation prototype that was found and repaired.<br />The biggest reason I've always seen the 32-/64-bit era as a &quot;modern&quot; era in my mind is probably because it's the era when 3D games became standard, that's a huge change in most genres of games that has changed little since. The next biggest reason is that the 32-/64-bit era was designed to use high level programming languages while the 16-bit era was still mostly into assembly.
