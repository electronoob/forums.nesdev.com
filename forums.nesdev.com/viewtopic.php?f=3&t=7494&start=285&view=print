<br />
<br />How does differentiating a game folder from a regular folder bloat the idea? Double clicking a folder in a load window typically assumes navigation. With an extension, it can know you mean to run it without having to do something less efficient like interpret its contents.
<br />
<br />Similar logic for archives. How would an emulator know it's meant to be handled differently? How would a user know the difference if the filename was identical to a compressed iNES file? In fact, any game file not using an extension prefix is what prevents emulators from being able to filter out non-game zip files from the load directory.

<br />
<br />that's what rom manager are for, imho. so that you store gamefile in the way you want and you don't store e.g. a Megadrive game or other zipfile inside your NES folder.
<br />
<br />
<br />anyway, if other devs find your approach useful, I'm fully supportive!

<br />
<br />To an extent, I agree. People need to sort their own shit in folders so that the burden isn't on the emulator to filter for you. But let's say you created a multi-patch container to go with multi-rom container. Can't have identical filenames in the same folder.

<br />Unless you're storing, say, all versions of Klax together.
<br />
<br />Another case: I don't have an "NES folder" on one of my machines. I have /home/pino/develop, which currently contains SDL projects and NES projects but could expand to Genesis projects and Android projects. Even for someone who plays only licensed NES games, where in the file system would this NES folder be located so that the emulator can find it?

<br />
<br />most emulators let you choose a path to roms, don't them?
