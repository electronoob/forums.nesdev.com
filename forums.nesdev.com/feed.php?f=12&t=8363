If you put headphones in its really bothersome but it is barely noticeable while playing. I love the cartridge lock idea, it works very well. I am enjoying the system, but it seems to electrically shock me while it is plugged into the tv, every time I touch the device. It's enough to almost hurt. anyone else have that problem?<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=5141">mgalekgolo</a> — Fri Dec 30, 2011 6:35 pm</p><hr />

I've got this same issue with my FC mobile II.  I didn't think much of it when I noticed the problem.  But now that I think about it...   The issue is most likely that the portable is operating at a lower voltage around 3.5 or so for me and prob you too.  So when the batteries run low you actually get too low for the battery back circuitry to work properly on the WRAM (in my case not sure the term for SNES)<br /><br />So when that happens the SRAM will end up operating during game play off the cart's battery and not the console/portable.  This would cause huge issues and due to the in line resistor on the batteries supply it probably switches power supply back and forth a lot.  I would imagine this type of action would wreak havoc on the save data.  So this could explain why all the issues with battery back saves on any portable really operating at a lowered voltage.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=4832">infiniteneslives</a> — Tue Dec 06, 2011 11:58 pm</p><hr />

Do you have a link to the NintendoAge thread?<br /><br />Super Mario RPG works on my Supaboy, but I after a few playing a few times, my saves ended up getting erased.  Now, my cart has its original batteries in it, so it might just be dead batteries and not the Supaboy that erased the games.  Is it even possible for the system to erase save games?<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=94">Jagasian</a> — Tue Dec 06, 2011 11:42 pm</p><hr />

It seems so far the only chip giving any problems with a guy on NA is SA-1, and the Capcom X2 custom chip for polygon rendering works and so does SFX1/2 so it seems like the CPU is pretty good, just gotta see if it really has problems with SA-1 or if it's a problem with his cart, which he says is also shaky in a system.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=4311">3gengames</a> — Sat Dec 03, 2011 7:43 pm</p><hr />

&gt; The X position in OPHCT ($213C) can be 0 to 339. Do games correctly handle the case of wrapping from 339 on one line to 0 on the next?<br /><br />Probably depends on the game. You can always increase your latency a few extra cycles so the X-pos is the same, and Y-pos is real Y-pos+latency.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=375">byuu</a> — Sat Dec 03, 2011 2:34 pm</p><hr />

I have a clone (an old one) and I haven't noticed anything out of place in any games I'm familiar with. Since my clone's ASIC are packaged the same as Nintendo's I tend to believe they are functional replicas, not the result of reverse engineering. I also believe the poor accuracy for NES clones is probably the result of noisy/contaminated processing leading to a few bad transistors or something. There are analog changes from process to process so things like DAC may be affected, but I believe digital areas carry over well. Perhaps due to the SNES' (static?) CMOS nature it's "more digital" than the dynamic NES logic and was cloned what seems to be very successfully. I'm not going to argue for clone build or design quality though, just the ASIC.<br /><br />Probably the only reason SA-1 games take issue with SNES clones is that clones typically lack CIC.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=20">kyuusaku</a> — Thu Dec 01, 2011 9:24 pm</p><hr />
