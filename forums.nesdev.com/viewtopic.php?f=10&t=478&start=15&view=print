<br />This also helps emulator authors avoid the extra work of getting their emulators correct. :)

<br />
<br />P - processor status register?
<br />
<br />IRQ - when BRK instruction encountered or sound routine generates one?
<br />
<br />SLnum - Scan Line... why doesn't my NMI routine start at 240 instead of 241?
<br />And what's the deal with scan line -1?
<br />
<br />CPUTicks: Okay, I get the second number, that's the actual CPU cycles (how do you get 1/3 or 2/3 of a CPU tick?). What's the first one (other than 3 times the second one)? How do these work? Is there a document I should be reading?
<br />
<br />CPU &amp; PPU Pages.... Huh?
<br />
<br />Is there like a manual for Nintendulator that I missed?
<br />
<br />Thanks for all the help!

	<tr>
		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />P: Processor Status Register, the official name of the Flags register. The flags themselves are shown immediately below.
<br />
<br />IRQ: Currently active interrupt sources. Up to 4 can be shown, "DMC" (DPCM sample finished), "FRM" (APU frame IRQ), "EXT" (external, from the mapper), and "DBG" (triggered by the 'IRQ' button in the debugger, though with the current logic it will never actually be displayed in the debugger).
<br />
<br />SLnum: The current scanline number. Scanline -1 is the 'dummy' scanline during which the background render pipeline is primed. Visible scanlines range from 0 to 239. The reason your NMI routine starts at scanline 241 instead of 240 is because that is how a real NES PPU actually works.
<br />
<br />CPUTicks: The first number indicates the PPU's state within the current scanline - values 0-255 correspond to the rendered pixels, and 256-340 correspond to HBLANK.
<br />
<br />CPU Pages: 16 numbers to indicate what is currently mapped at each 4KB memory range. ??? means unknown data (possibly empty), ### means PRG ROM, and A## means PRG RAM.
<br />
<br />PPU Pages: 12 numbers to indicate what is mapped at each 1KB memory range, including the nametable region. ??? means unknown data (possibly empty), ### means CHR ROM, A## means CHR RAM, and N## means nametable RAM.
<br />
<br />
<br />In general, if you don't understand what something means, it's not useful to you.

<br />
<br />It is due to a combination of things: the LCD and the dynamic CPU frequency scaling.  I have played many games under both Windows and Linux that get screwed up if you have CPU frequency scaling enabled.  It is used for saving battery life, by changing your CPU speed depending on the system load and the amount of battery available.  It totally screws up the timing in some games, causing them to think that your computer is slower than it really is... as most likely the game checks for timing details when the CPU is throttled down and then when the CPU is sped up again, the game runs too fast.
<br />
<br />Disabling CPU frequency scaling fixes the problem.  Just remember to enable it when you are not playing games, as it is a good thing and it is really the game's fault for not working correctly.  Off the top of my head, the games that have problems with it are: Deus Ex (under Windows and emulation on Linux) and More Quakeworld (under Windows and Linux).
<br />
<br />The LCD screen is also a big problem.  In my opinion, when it comes to gaming, a high-quality CRT is still king.  However, the other technologies are gaining and the CRT is basically at its peak of what it can do.

<br />
<br />The source of the problem is most likely the RDTSC (Read Time Stamp Counter) instruction which is the cpu's own high resolution timer. It's accurate as hell but will, as mentioned, wreck havoc on programs relying on its frequency being constant.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />QPC should be fairly safe to use. The hardware counter it uses may be different across systems but the most common seems to be the PMT (3.57 MHz) or the PIT (1.19 MHz). Altough unlikely these days, it may also use the RDTSC in which case one should do a re-check with QPF once in a while to make sure the frequency is up to date.
<br />
<br />As for myself, I use the QPC (unless vsync=ON and NES frame rate=monitor refresh rate) but enable the option to use the less accurate timeGetTime() which may be more reliable once it has been set up to use the highest resolution possible with timeBeginPeriod() / timeEndPeriod().
