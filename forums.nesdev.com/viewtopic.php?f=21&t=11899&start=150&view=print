I'll take those suggestions into consideration. I don't really want to go too crazy with sprites in the background, as the towns are to have wandering NPCs, as in Zelda II.

These were started on the side, just to amuse myself while working on the code for the 1st game. Both of these future games will use mappers, and (possibly) CHR ram.<br /><br />The dungeon walls in the 3rd game mock-up are *very* unfinished. They were intended as a throwback to the original game, with more of a Zelda 3 style of depth. I messed up my measurements for the bricks, at some point, so they don't line up quite right.

I just removed the blue, and transitioned using a &quot;weighted&quot; gradient. (bands of colour, of varying thickness to give an effect of depth.) I'll add the water shine back later.<br /><br />Also, I decided the full-black title background was boring, so I threw a background onto it, and changed up the text palette.<br /><br /><img src="http://i.imgur.com/nqlpPhR.png" alt="Image" /><br />EDIT: Oops!

My fault, for posting at 3am, heh.<br /><br />On my initial read-up on 6502, I found examples, stating that sprite-objects were annoying to keep track of, once you started scrolling the screen. So I wrote a re-alignment code in a language I'm more familiar with, to get a better idea of what to do, so sprites don't jitter/collide with blocks incorrectly when the player is moving the screen. I've seen that effect in a number of games. So avoiding it, is ideal. (That platformer will have left/right horizontal scrolling.)

I freed up enough space to:<br />1. Add 4 8x8 sprites to the player, to show her carrying a shield, when she has one.<br />2. Added two tiles for the top of a cave entrance, to make it less blocky looking.<br />3. Added a 16x16 tile for &quot;shutter blocks&quot;, that slide into the floor, when you clear a room.<br />4. Generally re-organized the SH*T out of the CHR. Haha.<br /><br />So... collision storage? How do other people do it? I have my own technique, which I will show here, and it works quite nicely in my engine, so far.<br /><br />I calculate my sprites from-center, in order to make the code easier to read, and as a nice bonus, in 6502 ASM, this manages to save a fair-sized bit of space, at least, in larger games it would!<br /><br /><img src="http://i.imgur.com/Y7Qf0rB.png" alt="Image" /><br /><br />The sprite offset data listed below, is compiled from the *two!* collision bytes that are listed below the sprite area boxes at the top. Can you see how the data is shifted? ;D<br /><br />The data is calculated, and stored into RAM, on loading a new screen, so it's actually pretty fast!<br /><br />I *would* have charted my metasprite/tile format as well, but I have not slept in close to a week, due to spring break, and loud children. Ugh. (Both formats are practically identical, sitting comfortably at 5 bytes/per)
