<br />Then perhaps the wiki should be developed in parallel with an emulator, such that the emulator implements exactly what is described by the wiki. This is the approach that I'm taking with <a href="http://www.pineight.com/lj/" class="postlink">LOCKJAW</a>: to implement everything exactly as <a href="http://www.tetrisconcept.com/tetriswiki/Main_Page" class="postlink">Tetriswiki</a> describes it.

<br />
<br />This is something I've wanted to fix for a long time.. I've been thinking of setting up a little snesdev site for collecting all information and hopefully also the people intressted in developing for it.. only reason I havn't is that it takes time to set it up and write the code for the site.
<br />
<br />edit: removed some text that didn't really have anything with this to do.

<br />Indeed - it's fairly simple to install, and it's the very same code that runs the NESdev wiki.
<br />Hell, it's the very same code that runs Wikipedia.

<br />just have to run over to my work first.. had some important meeting.
<br />anyway.. as this is the first PUBLIC wiki I've installed, it would be good with some tips on how to config it to reduce the risk of spam.
<br />
<br />edit:
<br />Ok. it's up and running.. but I'm thinking of holding of the unveiling for a week until I get my next payment  so I can move my webspace over to a php5 enabled server - the one I'm hosted on now is php4 and they told me they could move me to a php5 server for ~20$ - so I can use the latest mediawiki so I can install some anti-spam extensions. sorry for the delay.

If one of the pickiest among you would please buy, or borrow, one and report back, the rest of us would be appreciative, because until someone does just that this discussion is largely moot. Chip and process analysis tells us absolutely nothing until a human ear steps in and has the final say.

<br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">Which Super NES games are the pickiest about SPC/DSP behavior?</div>
<br />Games where sound effects samples are hard to emulate proprely (SFX samples rely on clamping sample decoder in noise):
<br />- Chrono Trigger
<br />- Final Fantasy IV
<br />- Final Fantasy V
<br />- Final Fantasy VI
<br />- Romancing Saga
<br />- Romancing Saga II
<br />- Romancing Saga III
<br />- Live A Live
<br />- Secret of Mana
<br />- Seiken Densetsu III
<br />- Rudra no Hihou
<br />- Bahamut Lagoon
<br />- Megaman VII
<br />- Megaman X
<br />- Megaman X2
<br />- Megaman X3
<br />- Breath of Fire
<br />- Castlevania : Dracula X
<br />- Zelda III - A link to the past
<br />- ... most probably a ton of others ...
<br />
<br />Games where music samles are hard to emulate proprely (samples can be emulated as noise while they aren't supposed to be) :
<br />- Dragon Quest III (pizz strings)
<br />- Dragon Quest VI (pizz strings, identical to above)
<br />- Tactics Ogre (brass instruments)
<br />- ... most probably several others ...

BRR encoding is completely worked out, as is the drum issue in plok which I believe is masked by the interpolation handler's "saturation" during one particular stage. You really need to ask Fatlxception, or at least look at his openspc code.
