<br />I was wondering, wouldnt be single screen problem?
<br />Im doing the following:
<br />
<br />- when the games want to change the name table (0 or 1) i change my 4 pointers to point to the name talbe it wants (i have 0x400 * 4 external memory to handle name wich has nt data, and the appropiate functions and pointers to handle this memory area). I mean:
<br />
<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">lpNT&#91;0&#93; = g_NTMEM + NT * 0x400;<br />lpNT&#91;1&#93; = g_NTMEM + NT * 0x400;<br />lpNT&#91;2&#93; = g_NTMEM + NT * 0x400;<br />lpNT&#91;3&#93; = g_NTMEM + NT * 0x400;<br /></div>
<br />
<br />Where NT is what battletaods chooses via a write to 0x8000+ bit D4.
<br />
<br />is that correct? if not can somebody explain me how real single screen works, cos what i understand by "all four cuadrants points to the same name table" is that what i wrote.
<br />
<br />Thanks in advance.

<br />
<br />Correlation is not the same as causation - there are plenty of Mapper 7 games which do not use insane timing. The <em>actual</em> reason behind the timing insanity is that the game was written by Rare/Coin-It.

YES, my emulator has a similar problem - the game works, but it hangs "randomly" on Impact Crater stage *due to* sprite #0 (infinity loop).
<br />
<br />Secondly, it might be a CPU bug. Don't trust NEStress.

<br />Scince Rare is basically a british software company, the game was originally written for the PAL format, so it's why it uploads to much tiles during VBLank, that is MUCH longer under a PAL screen, right ?
<br />The PAL version of Battletoads probably doesn't use any tricky timings scince the VBlank is long enough to upload all the large array of graphics the game needs each frame, then the PPU can be constantly turned on, unlike the NTSC version.
<br />Maybe if would be easier to first get the PAL version to work ?
<br />
<br />About single screen miroring, I'm pretty much confused myself. Does that mirroring apply only while reading data, or for both read and write to the name table ? If it's both, then the nametable used for all 4 screens is determined by the single mirroring bit regardless of if the game write or reads it. In that case, it would probably change several times in a single VBlank while uploading status bar's tiles and playfield tiles.
<br />Else, that would mean that write to PPU $2000-$23fff will write to nametable 1, and write to PPU $2400-$27fff will write to nametable 2. Then, when the screen is rendered, only the name table 1 or 2 is used in function of the 1-screen mirroring bit. That would make programmer's live easier, but it would need extra logic on the cartridge.
<br />I don't know wich one of those is correct for a mapper 7 game. And what about a MMC1 game in single screen mode ?

<br />
<br />So a game will need to flip between nametables by changing the mirroring mode when writing tiles to $2007.. unless it only needs to write to one nametable.
<br />
<br />Or as Bregalad put it... one screen mirroring applies to both reading/writing.

<br />what is wrong with nestress.  i cant get that to work yet but was going to use it.  i can get some demos to display ok, but alot of games just show a grey screen,  few black...

You should pay attention about a complex image - if the PPU scroll registers are reset in a wrong time, sprite #0 will fail out (no background pattern at that time).

<br />
<br />That's what we call a "hack".  In that you're doing something else wrong to cancel out the thing that's wrong... rather than fixing what is initially wrong.  ;P
<br />
<br />Er... so yeah...  there ARE 20 scanlines of VBlank.  This isn't the way to fix your problem... and will potentially break other games besides Battletoads.

Making your emulator custom for certain games is what very old (and therefore crappy emulators used to do). Never introduce hacks for games, if it doesn't work then go back and find out why, as this is considered good programming practice.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />WedNESday, I imagine your enthusiasm for supporting the hardware exactly might wane when you find out all the intricate details. I've been testing the PPU's VBL flag recently and it's quite intricate (yes, the simple behavior of being set and cleared automatically).
<br />
<br />I don't think there's anything wrong with an emulator running a limited set of games, <em>as long</em> as it's not being claimed to be a full NES emulator or that it emulates those games correctly. Some reasons for writing an emulator have little to do with general accuracy. There's an odd elitism I've seen here recently regarding the "correct" way to experiment with NES emulation. Obviously there is only one correct NES emulator (one that performs exactly as the hardware does), but that's not the only possible goal. This elitist attitude takes the fun out of writing an emulator and discussing it here.
