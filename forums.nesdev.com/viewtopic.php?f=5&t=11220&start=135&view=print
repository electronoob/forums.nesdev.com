		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I've got my local print shop working on proofs for the box and labels.  Should have those to share next week, then we'll hit the presses.  Should only take a week to get those printed off.<br /><br /><strong>FINAL ROM</strong> <br />Aside from the printed materials I've got a slew of carts assembled just waiting on the final rom programming and stickers to be applied.  I haven't tested RC3 for myself yet, but RC2 worked just fine on final hardware.  Think we'll be good to call the rom final by next Friday (3/6/2015)?  If so, then I can start flashing carts next weekend.  Should have printed materials complete shortly afterwards too.<br /><br /><strong>RELEASE DATE</strong><br /> If that all goes as planned I think we can set the release date tentative as March 24th.  I'm actually quitting my day job March 13th, and then I'll be hitting the road early April.  So setting the release date of that week will be best from my end that way I can get the initial wave of carts out the door before I move.<br /><br /><strong>BOX PRINT QTY</strong> <br />So due to timing of the printed materials and another release I'm working on, we can actually get a pretty decent deal and aren't as subject to the higher pricing of lower qty's on boxes.  We can effectively get them at the 500qty price point of $1.70ea.  Basically qty doesn't matter much as we won't get high enough for the next break at 1k.  Any votes on what quantity of boxes we should invest in?  Last time around we sold 150 loose carts without much trouble over the course of ~7 months.  CIB purchases typically make up the majority of sales especially in the beginning.  I'm thinking 200 boxes should cover us long term.  It's possible we'll run out later in life, but that should last us long enough.  I suppose if we run out of boxes doing a reprint the following year assuming we kept printing boxes for new volumes in the future.  If no one weighs in on the box qty I'll go with 200.<br /><br /><strong>PURCHASE PRICE LOOSE CART</strong> <br />In the past we did $40 for loose cart and made ~$25ea.  This year I'd like to include a dust sleeve and potentially a single page B&amp;W manual.  Prices of everthing have moved around a little as suppliers for everything isn't the same.  But even with the addition of dust sleeve and manual I should be able to keep profit close to the $25ea with the $40 buying price.  Do we have any desire to change that price point?  Personally I think it's reasonable as-is, but that's for the community to decide.  Keep in mind the prize clear carts for compo entrants will be free to them, compared to vol. 1 where they saved $5 off purchase.  <br /><br /><strong>ADDED COST OF CIB OPTION</strong> <br />Aside from our cost of $1.70 of the box, there are a couple other minor costs including styrofoam, and added time/packaging.  Basically CIB's will cost us ~$2.  What would we like to charge for the added CIB option?  I'd recommend somewhere between $6-10.  My gut says $8, if we're keeping the Loose cart at $40.  If we opt to drop the Loose cart price to $35ish, then maybe +$10 for the box would make sense..?  <br /><br /><strong>VOLUME 1</strong>  <br />Based on conclusion by crickets after my <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/viewtopic.php?f=22&amp;t=9393&amp;start=180#p137814" class="postlink">inquiry post</a> it doesn't sound like we're of the mind to kick off a long term release of vol1 alongside vol2.  Just want to mention/confirm that we have no such desires as a community.  I do have a couple dozen labels left over from vol1, but I guess those aren't of much use as Streemerz prob wouldn't be included.  On top of that we'd have to act quick to make a non-Streemerz vol1 rom and label, so doesn't sound like vol1 long term release is in the cards for a number of reasons..<br /><br /><strong>MONEY....$</strong> <br />I've got our <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/viewtopic.php?f=22&amp;t=9393&amp;start=180#p137814" class="postlink">$2629.97 balance</a> sitting in a specific <a href="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/18341918/nesdev/27feb15_nesdev_savings.jpg" class="postlink">nesdev savings acct</a> with my bank.  We're going to spend somewhere around $600 of that on printed materials, leaving us with close to $2k.  I don't really plan on charging for the build of all the carts in one large sum, I'll just bill for carts as they sell as it's simpler to keep track of, and don't have much question about recovering my investments.  So that money is available for whatever we'd like to do with it.  I assume we'll have a future compo with prizes and such, but we'll earn quite a bit with vol2 sales also.  Somewhere around $30/copy * 200ish copies = $6k, plus $2k we have now.  Quite a bit of cash with that $8k...  Perhaps that's a good argument for reducing sale price..  It'd be nice to see it go towards things like any hosting costs we may have, although I have no knowledge of what that entails other than Woahman was hosting us last I knew.  I don't really have an issue sitting on this money as I have been.  But I'd rather see it go towards something like we wanted, nor do I want people thinking I'm lining my pockets..  Just trying to be open about our available funds and my continued support to spend them as the community sees fit. <br /><br /><strong>TAXES</strong> <br />Something I hadn't really thought much about until I filed taxes in spring of 2014 is how to handle this.  I didn't have much for options when the time came, so I acted with the only legal conclusion I could come up with.  Since nesdev isn't it's own taxable entity, I couldn't write a 1099 or equivalent to nesdev for it's earnings in 2013 for vol1 sales.  Those sales were through my site/business, and from an IRS standpoint, the only thing I could really do was consider those sales earnings as a taxable earnings to my business.  So in reality &quot;I paid income tax on those vol1 sales&quot;.  Truth be told, I didn't end up really paying much if anything for taxes on it based on my entire tax situation.  I'm not really concerned about it, I mainly just wanted to be clear and transparent on how I handled it.  That being said, if someone has a different legal proposal of a better or alternate way to handle things in the future, I'm willing to support or entertain the proposal.  Keep in mind, somebody, somewhere probably have to pay taxes on these dollars unless we were to become a 501c3 non profit.  I'm somewhat knowledgeable of our options there having once been the treasurer of a non-profit.  Unless there's some other reason to go non-profit, I'd much rather just pay the taxes on the sales myself vs. going through all the work involved of becoming a 501c3.  I suppose I could figure out exactly how much I'm paying in taxes on the earnings and subtract that from our available fund balance.  But I'm not really too concerned about it personally, unless others are.<br /><br /><strong>TRACKING SALES</strong><br />Something I've been doing for other released titles on my site is to auto-forward all paypal invoice emails for cartridge sales to the developer.  I'd propose that I do similarly for action53v2, and auto-forward invoice emails for all sales to someone(s), perhaps a moderator?  Tepples? WhatULive4? others?  I don't have to do this, but I like doing it as it keeps things transparent on my end, making it so I'm not the only individual with a real time veritably accurate pulse on sales.  If I have email addresses, I can get that setup and run a quick auto-forward test.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />&quot;Korobeiniki&quot; is the only song I'm aware of where Tetris Holding actually holds a trademark, and then even on the melody. RHDE 341 used only the bass line of &quot;Tetris New Melody&quot; (a fan-made cover version of &quot;Korobeiniki&quot;), intentionally avoiding the trademarked melody. But something called to my mind that the composer of the bass line of the cover version might object. So I switched it to &quot;Kalinka&quot;.

I'd be in favor of others also getting it as well to help with transparency and any complications that could arise in the future.<br /><br />In your experience, what percentage of people will opt-in for a box?  I can't recall if you have had any releases that offered cart only as well as CIB.  Regardless @ $1.70 it is relatively negligible in the grand scheme of things, and we can always offer discounted box-only options if we are left with a bunch of extras.<br /><br />As for taxes, I'm not really familiar with how things work in the US (or Canada  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_redface.gif" alt=":oops:" title="Embarassed" /> ) but I'd be in favor of refunding any costs derived from the contest. I know you aren't too concerned, but I don't see why you should have to be penalized for your generous contributions to the contest.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I'll add <!-- e --><a href="mailto:NESHomebrew@gmail.com">NESHomebrew@gmail.com</a><!-- e --> to the auto-forward list along with any others interested.<br /><br />Generally early sales are near 100% CIB, but the nesdev crowd is a bit less of collecting crowd as well, so maybe we will be looking at around 80-90% CIB's..?  After initial sales die down, it gets closer to a 50% mix.  Over all probably looking at ~70% CIB.  I think 200 is a good number for CIBs.  It's also not the worst thing to only offer loose carts late in life.  So CIB's are limited to some degree, they don't always have to be available.<br /><br />As for taxes, I'll pay more close attention this time around to how much I'm actually getting taxed on these sales.  If it's significant I'll probably deduct it from nesdev's balance, but I don't expect it to be, so we prob won't have to worry about it anyway.<br /><br />Based on the silence, and most ppl being good with RC2 previously, I'm guessing we're good to call RC3 the final rom.  Assuming Tepples set up the title screen text similar to last time I shouldn't have trouble manually tweaking the rom from here.  I'm planning on starting to flash boards tonight/tomorrow.  They can be reflashed in an emergency, or minor emergency depending on how many I've burned through and if it's worth the effort of reflashing.
