		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />It's true that the OP's message wasn't their own question, but I don't really see any harm at all in a few of us having accidentally answered it. ...and I <em>do</em> kinda see some harm in proactively treating every noob as if they need to prove their humanity to you. (Silent scrutiny of a first poster is probably OK, if you're interested in that, but TBH I'd rather take a minute to write a useless reply than try to riddle out a user's origins from the scraps of information available to a non-mod.)<br /><br />The actual spam content was entirely within the signature. As soon as that was dealt with by a mod, IMO problem solved. If you spot the spam, just flag it, post in the thread to say &quot;hey this is a spammer, don't bother&quot;, and I think we're done. Everything beyond that is an admin's job, nobody else has the information or tools/permission to really do anything else.<br /><br />Administrators can decide what approach they want to use to try and prevent spammers from getting accounts in the first place, but that's a different matter.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Often, if I see a first post that looks suspicious, I'll copy the subject line or most/all of the message body into Google.  Doesn't happen too often in the NES posts (though sometimes we've seen earlier posts from the same thread copied..), most often it's in the general section and you'll see the same post appear on forums of other sites, too.<br /><br />I've joked about it before, but if we can make a spammer learn 6502 assembly to post here, then we can declare victory, haha.  But yeah, usually the fake posts are just other people's posts copied/pasted.
