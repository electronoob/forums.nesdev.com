<br />
<br />Game Gear is 160 pixels wide, just like Game Boy, and that would allow for 8x8 pixel metatiles, 20 across. But in such an environment, "LIFE" and "TIME" would normally not be that small.

<br />I'm counting the bright orange blocks on the bottom, and I'm assuming that each visual "square" is 8x8, and I counted 19, from left to right (that black gap is tricky though)
<br />19 * 8 = 152. The colors are too bright, in my opinion, to be Gameboy Color graphics, and status bars on the gameboy tend to be white, instead of black, especially on games that are compatible with the classic gameboy, due to the effect that too much "dark" on a scanline tends to shift the entire scanline dark on the original LCD.
<br />
<br />Now, for TIME being so small, I'd imagine that the status bar up there doesn't need to have the whole alphabet loaded, since this game doesn't look like the kind of game that'd have dialog in-level. As such, there's nothing stopping the graphic artist from just cramming "TIME" in as few tiles as possible. If you look at Donkey Kong for NES, you can see an example of this. "BONUS" and "TOP" are squeezed in fewer tiles to save screen estate, so this isn't unusual.
<br />
<br />Lastly, the character portrait in the status bar. This is more of a style observation, but I think SEGA had the most spikey blue hair of everyone, not just because of Sonic, but because of games like Phantasy Star and Zillion. This probably has no real logic to back it up, but it's what got me thinking out of the box, at least. *shrug*

<br />No, they are most likely 16x16 (or 8x18 in a system with half horizontal resolution) like tepples said.
<br />
<br />Very few games used blocks as small as 8x8, this is incovenient for many reasons (map size, for example), and doesn't look very good either. Only systems with very small screens or very little resolution used them, but even then not that much. Older games may have used 8x8 tiles as their primary block size in the attempt to save tiles, but 16x16 became just so much more common. To me this games looks like a somewhat advanced side scroller, so it can't be that old.
<br />
<br />Also, there's the fact they are arranged like bricks in a wall, with each row horizontally offset half a block relative to the previous row, something that's more commonly done with 16x16 metatiles.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />You're right, I drew a grid on top of the pic, and it does look like a width of 320 fits a bit better. Especially if you consider the size of the skeleton character in the center, and how the tree in the background isn't as tall. It looks like the difference in height would be one tile.
<br />
<br />Especially, taking what I thought was 8x8, and moving it over the lettering in the status bar, 4 tiles fit, so those orange blocks must be 16x16.
<br />
<br />I guess the main thing that got me was that green grass with dirt under it is usually two tiles of grass on top, two tiles of dirt on bottom, and that's 16x16.
<br />
<br />Sorry, thought I was on to something but I wasn't. :S

<br />I was thinking it might have been doing something like the tiles in WORLD *-4 of Super Mario Bros.

<br />
<br />Obviously it's no Kamen Rider, it's just a girl with blue hair. I must say the graphics do look quite NESish when you take the colors into account, but the sprite count and metatile count suggest this is for another system. Of course it could simply be a mock-up.

<br />There's a straightened image. It seems there are 32 tiles across, if you look at the Life meter, and count each letter as a tile. It seems there are 16 tiles all the way to the end of the health bar, which ends at the exact middle of the screen.
<br />
<br />EDIT: You know, there's always the possibility that this really isn't a game. It looks like it could be a mock-up. Look how not straight the metatile boundaries are. Just a thought...
<br />
<br />But I did find it possible that the screen height is 30 tiles. I made a stack of 30 of the letter "L" and it was the height of the screen.
<br />
<br />EDIT 2: Also... How many sprites are on those scanlines with the fireballs??? It seems there are at least 20!
<br />
<br />EDIT 3: Oops, I didn't realize tokumaru said most of what I said. But when I look at it, I really think it's a mockup. I mean, those tiles on the bottom are atrocious, and they look completely unconvincing. Then by the health bar, it looks like there's a border from cutting/pasting a random health bar from a JPEG image. Then when you look at the fireballs, there are just too many sprites on the scanline. It's possible that these graphics are from a real game though, just cut and pasted poorly.
