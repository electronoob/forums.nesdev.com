<br />PROTIP: You can make shifts up an octave even less noticeable by opening the duty cycle (from 1/8 to 1/4, or from 1/4 to 1/2) at the same time.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Yep I knew what you meant. Although I'm not exactly pleased with the way it sounds (you can still tell..at least, I can. Heh) it's still a nice get-around, and I did use it to play some 9th octave notes in Endless Attack (special2.s3m/nsf, you'll hear it on the scaling pure square wave going upward with a higher octave'd echo..you can see it too if you look at the S3M)
<br />
<br />Unfortunately it doesn't sound as convincing in Concrete Man's song (I just tried it). It's all good though, the modification I made doesn't really have that much of an impact on the song, it still sounds / feels like Concrete Man. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />
<br />
<br />Oh well, I'm still working on Plug Man. That buzzing noise isn't sounding so hot because whenever it's retriggered, it seems to initiate a different instance of the same sound every time (kind of why Quick Man in Mega Man 2's buzzing noise sounded different all the time throughout the song). But hey it could add character!
<br />
<br />I'll probably be finished this song in a couple hours. I'm gonna take a quick break.
<br />
<br />EDIT: Plug Man so far: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://tssf.gamemusic.ca/temp/plug.nsf">http://tssf.gamemusic.ca/temp/plug.nsf</a><!-- m -->
<br />When I'm done this song, I'll post up the dated archive for all to hear (I made some improvements to some old songs, too)

If you also notice, that's when the song begins "glitching" out. I think it has something to do with S3M2NSF skipping frames to keep on time or something. I dunno.
<br />
<br />If you listen to the S3M (using winamp of course), you'll notice it's the same throughout.

<br />Oh, and a sneak peak at what I'm working on now:

<br />
<br />Any song that's naturally 150bpm will convert proper. Unfortunately, Mega Man 9 uses other tempos, which causes some major problems with S3M2NSF because it doesn't like that.
<br />
<br />btw, finished Wily Stage 2:

<br />That song was a pain to do for some reason..it was longer and more repetitive, but more maintenance because I had to throw in the "echos"

A few effects on lava man's stage will either have to have some colors removed (because they violated the number of allowed colors on a bg tile there) or be done with sprites, adding even MORE flicker.

It does a few things that the NES is not capable of, like going outside the note range, having perfect pitch at extremely high pitches, triangle lacks aliasing (could be "rendering error thing" but it isn't).  They said in an interview that they used some VSTs to do it.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">Lord Nightmare wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">P.S.

<br />
<br />Not only would it have a lot of flicker, it would be really slow.  Even the old Mega Man games had tons of slowdown-- it's really obvious after playing a lot of Mega Man 9, then switching to another MM game.  Some minibosses, like the dragons, would make the NES slow to a crawl since <em>every flame on the dragon is an individual sprite,</em> which can be seen if you use Black Hole Bomb on it.
<br />
<br />Oh and as to the colors in a BG tile being violated...where is this?  As far as I can remember, MM9 has really really simplistic/repetitive backgrounds.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />There was one song I remade from Mega Man 9, which I can't remember which one..but I could tell that there were two instances of the Triangle wave that were playing at once..like a long bass note that didn't quite cut off before another bass note played after it. I think it was the shop music, I can't be sure though. EDIT: It was actually at 7 seconds into the song, where the bass note was still playing while the triangle tom played overtop of the other note..something the original NES obviously couldn't do.
<br />
<br />That's when I knew that they weren't using an engine that was limited to 4 channels. When I did the "NES Version" of the song I obviously stuck to NES limitations.
<br />
<br />It became pretty apparent that some points in the game just couldn't be done well on the actual NES. I don't want to mention any spoilers, but there's a certain point where the older games were "referenced" where I'm actually fairly certain that the NES could not handle all those sprites on screen.
