		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Heya guys.
<br />
<br />I got me a shiny new PowerPak. It works fine on my PAL NES, but for obvious reasons I want to enjoy the majority of the games in full 60hz. To solve this, I also got a Sharp Twin Famicom (AN-500B) and a regular Famicom (HVC-CPU-GPM-02 board from 1989). The 72-60 pin converter I got from <a href="http://stoneagegamer.com/nestofamicomconverter72-pinto60-pin.aspx" class="postlink">StoneAgeGamer</a>.
<br />
<br />Currently, I only have one genuine PAL cartridge (Duck Hunt+SMB), but it seems to run fine with the pin connector on the Sharp FC and the cart label faced the other way. However, the PowerPak only gives me a solid white screen, no matter how many times I press reset, which way I turn the cart, or how much I fine tune connecting position. Does anybody know about this issue?
<br />I don't know squad about FC connector details, but If it helps, I'm including reference pictures of the connector insides here:
<br /><a href="http://lx.sporez.com/leschtuff/FC_connector_front.jpg" class="postlink">Front</a>
<br /><a href="http://lx.sporez.com/leschtuff/FC_connector_back.jpg" class="postlink">Back</a>
<br />
<br />Of course, I'd have already tested out the PowerPak on the regular Famicom, if I didn't (possibly) kill it with reverse polarity (yeah I'm stupid). Since I can't see or smell the severity of the damage, can anybody enlighten me with the most common damage types that reverse polarity can cause to an FC?
<br />And for that matter, if only something on the RF modulator were broken, would it still be possible to salvage the rest of the mainboard? Since I'd AV-mod the console anyway, maybe I could just throw out the RF board and give it a 5V+ feed instead.

<br />
<br /><strong><em>From the PowerPak manual</em>:</strong>
<br />
<br /><em>Plug in the PowerPak and turn on the NES. The PowerPak includes the Ciclone multi region lock out chip. If your system Is blinking but shows video try pressing the reset button. This will tell the Ciclone to try the next region. When the correct region is found it will be saved so this process should only be needed once.<br /><br />If you have hit reset 8 times and It is still blinking your 72 pin connector Inside the NES may need to be cleaned or replaced Blowing on the cart will add condensation that will damage the cart.</em>
<br />
<br />
<br />Do can also get a PAL&lt;-&gt;NTSC cart adapter for problems like this on any cart. These products are called the ‘GameKey” and can be purchased off a few websites. 
<br />
<br />Would you like to see the busted FC for parts? If so, please PM me. I’ve made this mistake too, when I was tired and didn’t pay attention to what connector I was handling, so I know that 'I’m a dumbass' feeling. 
<br />
<br />I can use some broken FC units for parts, so sell me your bysted systems damnit!

<br />
<br />I did both of that. I tried pressing reset up to 10 times, but all I get is a short black flicker that leads to a white screen. I also plugged it with the label facing the other way, otherwise I wouldn't have gotten my PAL cart to run.
<br />Upon discovering the manual for the pin adapter, I noticed it's in fact a Yobo product. I've read on this board that those aren't really suited for use with the PowerPak. Maybe there is a way to mod them for PowerPak compatibility?
<br />
<br />Anyway, about my Famicom... the Famigods have granted me a great deal of luck. It only seems to have busted a diode and a fuse on the RF board. Getting the Mario music out of it after further testing means the mainboard is still well and breathing.
<br />I guess I'll try to cut out the edge of the RF board with unneeded parts to make room for the AV mod. But it looks like the voltage controlling transistor is pretty important to make it run.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I'm pretty sure it DOESN"T set the powerpak in ntsc or pal mode...as theres no real need for an ntsc or pal mode. (plus iirc theres no "mode" pin on the ciclone that could be used for this)
<br />
<br />edit: in fact I can prove it....it works on my famicom. The famicom doesnt have a lockout I "set" the chip to pal once...I cant "set" it without a proper lockout being connected.
<br />
<br />edit2: I've been thinking about why it doesn't work. I recall a thread awhile back about a guy having a similair problem. The problem had something to do with his import adaptor connecting some pins or something.

<br />
<br />Are you referring to <a href="http://nesdev.com/bbs/viewtopic.php?t=3492" class="postlink">this thread</a>? Guess that one doesn't really help if nobody has replied.
<br />
<br />I still haven't gotten to test the PowerPak on the Famicom yet, but I guess I we can safely say it has everything to do with the Yobo adapter being crap. What I'm looking for now is a way to fix the adapter I have, or places where I can buy better ones. Any clues?

<br />Ok, so I found <a href="http://playpower.pbworks.com/f/NES_Famicom_Pinouts.pdf" class="postlink">this data sheet</a> on the web. According to you, I need to connect the FC pins 47 (CHR RAM WR) and 48 (VRAM CE) to the NES pins 57 and 56 respectively. Something like this:

<br />
<br />Is this correct?

<br />
<br />Your sure bet is the 'Family Converter', another brand of NES72F-&gt;FC60M converter. I have one and it works splendidly on my Sharp Twin. The only guy who was any left is in England and wants around £15 for them, although that may include VAT, so they may se less to post stateside. 
<br />
<br />I’d like to source more, in bulk (at a bulk price), but as that's proving difficult, so I may have some made to the same spec instead.

<br />
<br />I may have some awesome converters coming in, and if I do, I will offer a couple for sale. These are pretty sharp, but my cost is high...sadly. 
<br />
<br />I have been considerimg using them as a master-design to pump out a run of them for a  lower cost... We shall have to see what my production cost will be.
