<br />
<br />Adventures of Dr. Franken (Unreleased) - Mark Cooksey
<br />Asmik Kun Land - Fumito Tamayama
<br />Earthworm Jim (Pirate) - Alex Yeu
<br />Michael Andretti's World Grand Prix - T. Mikumos, M. Bridgeroot
<br />Predator - Junichi Saito?
<br />Super Mario World (Pirate) - Alex Yeu?
<br />Ultimate Mortal Kombat 4 (Pirate) - Alex Yeu
<br />
<br />Gil recently did a translation of Asmik Kun Land. The game does not have credits but I can tell that's Fumito's audio driver that's being used in the game. Listen to Widget or Secret Ties and the listen to Asmik Kun Land. Also the non-looping songs in the NSFs make a weird repeating noise. I can't explain it. I'm REALLY DESPERATELY trying to find out the composer who worked for Mindscape. They developed Last Starfighter, M.U.L.E., Mad Max, Paperboy.
<br />For the games by Elite and NMS Software, Mark Cooksey confirmed to me that he did music for those.
<br />Also, for Sesame Street Countdown, the manual credits Michael Artin for the music too, but when I talked to him, he told me he didn't compose the music but he fixed the MIDI-conversion tool they used whenever it had problems. I decided to leave his name in the list because he's credited in the game's manual.

I know Jon Dunn originally did the C64 version's music which was ported to the NES version but he said he gave Sunsoft the source code to the music. I asked Sunsoft who arranged the NES version of Jon Dunn's C64 soundtrack and they said it was David Whittaker. I know that may be hard to believe, but if Sunsoft said it, then it must be true. Also I think Naoki Kodaka had something to do with the DMC music too.

<br />
<br />Also, for the Lolo games I'm pretty sure it's Manami Matsumae. The GameBoy version has the same exact sound effects as the NES games and it credits her. Eggerland on the FDS credits the composer as 'Zap Ajisai' and Mekyuu no Fukkatsu (Revival of the Labyrinth) credits the composer as Nige no Kanazashi (Anybody got a translation for that?). I also think Jun Ishikawa and Hirokazu Ando had something to do with Lolo 3 because it uses the PCM samples from Kirby's Adventure, but I could be wrong.

<br />I wonder if some DPCM samples came with later versions of the devkit. I'm pretty sure Nintendo provided a basic sample bank with the Super NES devkit.

<br />Interesting to see the actual name, I had it in some credits as "T. Hasuya" from somewhere.  I've always strongly suspected it's the same person who also did Conflict, Golgo-13 TSE, Last Armageddon, Dr. Jekyll, which is some great stuff (including Rygar).

<br />
<br />Yes, Michiharu also composed those games. And there's a few more. I got his real name from Solomon's Key. I'm assuming it's the first game he worked on. In Kid Kool, he's credited as N. Hasuya, the N possible standing for 'hasutaNi'.
<br />
<br />UPDATE: I recently talked to one of the game designers of Blues Brothers for the NES. He told me Christophe Fevre was the composer.
<br />
<br />UPDATE 2: I talked with a former Mindscape employee, and he said that Nick Eastridge composed the NES version of Paperboy. Hal Canon composed the Arcade version which is where the NES version's music is ported from. So you can update your Paperboy NSF with Hal Canon and Nick Eastridge. Nick is also the very possible composer of Conan, Mad Max, M.U.L.E, The Last Starfighter. I'm also assuming he composed Paperboy 2 because the SNES version uses the same instrument samples as James Bond Jr. which credits him and Peter Stone. I am going to call him later today to get verification and update this post so keep your eyes peeled.
<br />Also, Heroes of the Lance's music was ported from the MSX version, which is composed by Seiji Toda, but Hitoshi Sakimoto and Takeshi Yasuada ported the music to the NES version.
<br />
<br />UPDATE 3: Nick Eastridge answered today but he said he did not work on video games or music so it must be the wrong guy or he's lying to me. Either way, whoever did Paperboy surely did all of the other Mindscape's NES games (as in the ones they developed) and that programmer told me Nick Eastridge composed the NES version of Paperboy, so add this to your list:
<br />
<br />GAME - COMPOSER - DEVELOPER/PUBLISHER
<br />Conan - Nick Eastridge - Mindscape
<br />Last Starfighter - Nick Eastridge - Mindscape
<br />M.U.L.E. - Roy Glover, Nick Eastridge - Mindscape
<br />Mad Max - Nick Eastridge - Mindscape
<br />Paperboy - Hal Canon, Nick Eastridge - Mindscape
<br />Paperboy 2 - Nick Eastridge - Mindscape
<br />
<br />I also saw him credited in these games under the Special Thanks list, so I assume he wrote the audio drivers and/or MIDI converters for the games:
<br />Dirty Harry
<br />Captain Planet and the Planeteers

<br />
<br />Yup, that was the site the programmer sent me and I went to and it had his number so I called a couple times a day. But when he answered, he told me he never worked on music for video games. If it IS him, he probably said what he said to me because he was afraid I was going to say something bad about the music. I know he worked for Gray Matter too. If anybody else wants to take a swing at calling him, the number's on the site. He did sound kind of funny when he said it though.
<br />
<br />I also have a couple Color Dreams composers. I got this info by talking to the composers themselves or from some interviews. I can link you the interviews if you want, but here are the composers:
<br />Baby Boomer - John Borchert
<br />Pesterminator - Dan Burke
<br />Secret Scout and the Temple of Demise - Roger Deforest
<br />Raid 2020 - Dan Burke, Frank Waung
<br />
<br />The last author I have for you is for Harlem Globetrotters. I talked with the development company (Softie Inc.)'s founder Bruce Sandig and he said he wrote a MIDI conversion tool and gave Rob Wallace the sheet music to Sweet Georgia Brown (Globetrotters Theme?) and then Rob made a MIDI file and Bruce Sandig converted it to the NES. Softie Inc. only made this game and Classic Concentration, which Rob Wallace also composed, so add these to your author list:
<br />GAME - COMPOSER
<br />Classic Concentration - Rob Wallace
<br />Harlem Globetrotters - Rob Wallace
<br />
<br />Then some more composers for a game:
<br />Tetris (Japanese version by BPS) - Hisashi Zero Yotsumoto, Hiroshi Taguchi, Hiroshi Suzuki.
<br />
<br />Also, I thought I mentioned this before, but I asked Mike Riedel (Owner of RSP [Not to be confused with Rocket Science Productions]) Who composed the music for Win Lose or Draw and Remote Control since they don't have credits. He told me Nick Scarim did the music for those. For Sesame Street Countdown, the manual credits Russell Ginns and Michael Artin, though when I talked to Michael Artin, he said he only worked on the MIDI conversion tool. The game's music has lyrics which are about a hostage crisis. I have them written down if anyone's interested, and of course, Sesame Street: Big Bird's Hide and Speak is composed by Nick Scarim, who is known to have composed the music to the Spy Vs. Spy games.
<br />
<br />And in case somebody didn't list it already:
<br />Asmik Kun Land - Fumito Tamayama?
<br />J League Fighting Soccer - Shigenori Masuko, Youko Suzuki?
<br />Secret Ties - Dosukoi(Bakkin)Tamayama (Fumito Tamayama)
<br />Widget - S.Tachikawa, Fumito Tamayama, Thinp.Uchibori, Youko Suzuki.
<br />
<br />All these games have the same exact instruments so maybe somebody reverse engineered the other person's driver? The games with '?' are the games that don't have credits. That also happened with Countdown and Radiance's games:
<br />GAME - COMPOSER - DEVELOPER
<br />Great Waldo Search - Doug Brandon - Radiance
<br />Rollerblade Racer - Doug Brandon? - Radiance
<br />Sesame Street Countdown - Russell Ginns - RSP

<br />
<br />The guy was the Associate Producer for Mindscape and he said Mindscape themselves developed it, as well as M.U.L.E., Mad Max, Last Starfighter and Conan. I asked him who composed the NES version's music and he said Nick Eastridge. All the NES and SNES games developed by Gray Matter I see Nick Eastridge credited in there though so I would assume he worked there. He usually collaborated with Peter Stone. The SNES games they did music for unfortunately can't have their SPCs dumped for some reason.

<br />Most games keep music sequence data and its interpreter in SPC700 RAM. <a href="http://snesmusic.org/v2/wiki.php?iRequest=wiki/ViewPage&amp;iPage=Undumpable" class="postlink">Undumpable games</a> like Wario's Woods stream the music sequence data to the SPC700. Instead of the messages over the IPC ports ($2140-$2143) resembling "startSong(OPENING_CUTSCENE_MUSIC)", they're closer to individual MIDI messages or individual MOD rows: "playNote(GUITAR, C-3, 50% volume)". To dump these songs as SPC would require porting them to a different playback engine that doesn't stream sequence data, and that's not unlike <a href="http://nesdev.com/bbs/viewtopic.php?p=83239#83239" class="postlink">covering a spaghetti-ass NES game's soundtrack in FamiTracker</a>.
