This is especially annoying when you only have one brick left to hit, and the ball just won't go there on its own. You really need some way to support it.<br /><br />Sorry if I'm taking this too far, I just think it's a really interesting game design subject.

It depends on how you move the paddle and where the ball lands on it.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I couldn't say if there's some bad port of Arkanoid that doesn't give you some influence over the bounce angle, but in the NES version (and all others I can remember) it does. Maybe it's a bit limited, but it's still a critical and essential bit of control.<br /><br />Though there are some (IMO) poorly designed levels where the bricks you need to hit are at the end of a tunnel/maze of unbreakable bricks and you really can't do much of anything to aim down there.
