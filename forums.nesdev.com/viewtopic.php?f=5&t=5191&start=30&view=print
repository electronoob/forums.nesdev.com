<br />If you try to be too original, people won't know what they're playing. There really hasn't been a successful, genre-launching game since Parappa the Rapper established the music game genre in 1996 and the first Grand Theft Auto pioneered the criminal sandbox adventure in 1997.

But even taking that into account, it is still merely a combination of features from my two favorite platformers at the time, not even an original concept.  A rather pedantic point, anyway - surely you don't agree that this example means a child has a better grasp on game design than an adult?<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">If you try to be too original, people won't know what they're playing.

<br />If you want to be technical, Toejam &amp; Earl and its sequel pioneered that sort of gameplay years earlier.  (TJ&amp;E in a sandbox style, PoF closer to Parappa.)  "Criminal sandbox adventure" isn't much of a genre, either.  Either it fits within "action/adventure" or you have to also allow the likes of Katamari and Noby Noby Boy their own genres as well.  Similar things could be said for Electroplankton or Flower on PSN, or the "fast-forward/rewind platformer" kicked off by Prince of Persia and continued by Braid and others.
<br />
<br />That aside, I don't think the creation of a new genre is a fair measure of creative success.  It's certainly a positive, but healthy originality is possible within existing genres.  A number of classic genres languished for years until they resurfaced due to creative new entries, such as what the Sims did for simulations, or the recent resurgence of adventure games like Sam and Max, or the broad appeal of World of Warcraft.
<br />
<br />I don't believe originality should be stressed above all else, but I believe that in many cases an adult's originality has a greater capacity for creativity than a child's, else we would see far more children as high ranking members of dev teams.
