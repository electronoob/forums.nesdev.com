						<div class="postbody"><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">It's not about choice of words. I try to argue against the basic assumption: &quot;Cartoon style was good for Mario in the Mushroom Kingdom. But in a city, a realistic style is more fitting, so it matches the atmosphere.&quot;<br /><br />No, it doesn't. Realistic style matches the atmosphere in every situation because that's what humans look like in, well, reality.<br /><br />But if they already chose cartoon style, they should have kept it that way. Cartoon style in a big city is no more or less out of place than in a kingdom surrounding.<br /><br />The degree in how far each style fits to the surroundings is exactly the same: If you already have big-nosed cartoon characters in the kingdom surroundings, they also fit to the city surroundings.<br /><br />The idea that the cartoon style matches well with the kingdom locations while the realistic style matches more with the city environment is incorrect. In a &quot;Super Mario&quot; setting, even city folk should look like the Mario bunch.</div>Thanks, now I get it.<br />Maybe I'm misunderstanding you and realism may have many meanings, but don't try to deny that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Realism_(arts)" class="postlink">realism</a> isn't a widely accepted discipline of art.<br />Also you can't really say this and that is incorrect on a subjective matter like this. It's just a matter of opinions.<br />I want to clarify that my opinion isn't that the realistic characters are necessarily fitting better in a realistic urban environment like this, on the contrary I think mixing styles wildly works very well here. My opinion on this matter is only that I think the liberties Nintendo took in their choices of style is still within what I'd consider tasteful. In other words, I have no problem that the characters are depicted in a different way from Mario, and I don't think it necessarily means Mario isn't considered human.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">But if the whole point is to depict Super Mario as a giant, an inflated version of a normal human, then depicting all the other characters in this inflated version makes no sense.<br /><br />This has nothing to do with video game logic, it has to do with common sense:<br />If you want to depict your character as a giant, but literally every single other human character is exactly the same size, then people will never even get the idea that your character is supposed to be a giant.</div>I fully agree with you that making other characters and objects smaller is a good way to depict Mario as a giant. But on the other hand they might not have wanted to emphasize on that. Especially since the Super power up was added in later. And if making other characters smaller would mean they have to redraw them and therefore also loose detail, it probably isn't a very good idea. By video game logic I mean that if you can make something look better you do it, even if you have to sacrifice realistic proportions. You may think it's a retarded choice, but I think it's perfectly good choice considering the circumstances. In the end the only thing that matters is that it looks good and is interesting to look at, not that everything makes perfect sense.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">It's not ridiculous if these mushrooms are a common occurence in that world and if this means it protects you from any harm.<br />Don't you think if using a certain creme would prevent your skin from any impact for exactly one time, including car crashes, and that you don't need to re-apply the creme until it is actually needed, that people would use them by default, constantly?<br />Yes, superheroes only transform when they fight. But apart from being able to smash bricks, the Super Mushroom is something for protection. It doesn't make Mario faster or jump higher, it only acts as a life bar.</div>It wouldn't be ridiculous in the real world, if something only has benefits with no side effects, of course everyone would use it, that just makes logical sense. But it normally doesn't make sense for an author of a fictional work to implement something like that. In fiction, if there is a power up it usually comes with some limitation that makes it not possible to use it all the time, because if that was possible everything fantastic about it would disappear. Of course there are exceptions, but in general I think it's a bad idea.<br />The exact effects of the Super Mushroom is irrelevant to the discussion I think, what matters is that it increases your abilities.</div>

There's evidence that the land belonged to the Goombas, the Toads were the invaders, and the Goombas hired mercenaries from Koopa Troop (cartoons: Koopa Pack) to reclaim their homeland. Of course this wouldn't be clear from the manual because it's written from the Toads' point of view. On the other hand, Bowser appears to have occupied Dinosaur Land for no reason other than <em>Lebensraum</em>.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">Pokun wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">Video game logic, not everything is depicted in realistic proportions, especially if it would make it hard to see details in the low resolution the system provides, makes perfect sense to me.</div><br />Hence the large heads on <a href="https://allthetropes.org/wiki/Graphics_Induced_Super_Deformed" class="postlink">Graphics Induced Super Deformed</a> characters. But sometimes they keep their large heads even when next to more realistically proportioned characters, as opposed to transforming to meet the ambient art style like on <em>The Simpsons</em>. You can see this with big-headed child characters in <em>Super Smash Bros.</em> series, such as Ness, Lucas, Toon Link, and Villager, next to someone like Sheik or Marth or Captain Falcon or Ryu. So what's the excuse now? That they have to keep the heads big in order to accommodate the 3DS's top screen not being any taller than the NES's output?<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">Pokun wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">The Super Mushroom is a power up that increases your strength.

Nowadays, people wander around with their phones on them at all times. Athletes wander around with roids in them at all times.

Case in point: characters in the cities of Dimmsdale (<em>The Fairly OddParents</em>) and Townsville (<em>The Powerpuff Girls</em>) are cartoonish. So are the inhabitants of the neolithic Dome City (<em>Super Mario World</em> TV series). Also the cities in <em>EarthBo</em>-- wait a minute...<br /><br />Half of the <em>SMW</em> series shows the Mario Bros. introducing <a href="https://allthetropes.org/wiki/Bamboo_Technology" class="postlink">bamboo tech</a> to neolithic humans living among living-fossil wildlife. If it's supposed to be an adaptation of the Super Famicom* game <em>Super Mario World</em>, I can't tell what part, as game canon is that the dominant sapient species in Dinosaur Land is Yoshis. If anything, the cartoon is more like <a href="http://bootleggames.wikia.com/wiki/7_Grand_Dad" class="postlink">Mario meets <em>The Flintstones</em></a>. <br /><br />So either one of two things is true: Either <a href="https://www.mariowiki.com/Quest_for_Pizza" class="postlink"><em>Super Show</em> PL109 &quot;Quest for Pizza&quot;</a> is a <a href="https://allthetropes.org/wiki/Poorly-Disguised_Pilot" class="postlink">backdoor pilot</a> for <em>SMW</em>, or <strong>7 GRAND DAD IS CANON</strong>.<br /><br /><br /><span style="font-size: 85%; line-height: normal">* <em>SMW</em> has some Japan-only elements, like the sign over Bowser's castle reading &quot;Koopa&quot; and the continuity announcer describing it as <em>Captain N and the New Super Mario Bros. 4</em> over the credits of <em>Yo Yogi!</em> or whatever else preceded it on NBC's then Saturday morning lineup. Why is &quot;Unskinny Bop&quot; by Poison in my head now?</span></div>

	</div><br /><br />You really still think that the designer's intention in the left picture is &quot;in-universe, Toad is smaller than Mario, despite what the picture shows you&quot;?<br /><br />Or the intro to &quot;New Super Mario Bros.&quot;: Mario is in his Super form, walking with the Princess. Then the Princess gets kidnapped. Mario runs out of screen and you hear that he gets attacked. When he gets back on the screen, he's small.<br />So, you think that the developers intended Mario to take a walk in his Super form with Princess Toadstool being in her small form? (So much about Mario not using his Super form in everyday life, but only when he fights.)<br /><br />And despite the advanced graphics, you think that they <em>still</em> didn't present it in the way they intend it, but play a game of make believe where you are supposed to imagine something despite the scene on the screen showing you something completely different?<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">Pokun wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">But it normally doesn't make sense for an author of a fictional work to implement something like that.</div><br />As I said, it's primarily an item of protection, not attack. Mario doesn't deal more damage with it. That's not like Bruce Banner becoming the Hulk.<br /><br />But it doesn't really matter what's the explanation anyway. At least <em>your</em> explanation (all the other characters <em>are</em> in their small form, it's just that the sprites are <em>displayed</em> as big) simply doesn't hold water. It means contradicting what's right in front of our eyes.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">tepples wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">Of course this wouldn't be clear from the manual because it's written from the Toads' point of view.</div><br />You really like those fan theories, do you?<br /><br />The manual isn't written from <em>anybody's</em> point of view. The manual doesn't exist in-universe, it's the narrating description for us in the real world to explain the story of a game. If the manual says the Koopa Troopers are the invaders, then that's the case simply because the manual stating it <em>makes</em> it true.<br />You cannot accuse a story book for a work of fiction of being Stalinist revisionist hisory, unless that story book actually exists <em>within</em> that world.<br />But as long as that's just Miyamoto tellung us the story of his game, you cannot say it's not true. Him writing it <em>makes</em> it true because he creates the details of that world.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">tepples wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">You can see this with big-headed child characters in <em>Super Smash Bros.</em> series, such as Ness, Lucas, Toon Link, and Villager, next to someone like Sheik or Marth or Captain Falcon or Ryu. So what's the excuse now?</div><br />Stuff like &quot;Super Smash Bros.&quot; is just a fanservicey non-canon crossover. Of course they keep their individual styles there because these games happen in <em>neither</em> franchise's universe. I'm pretty sure the story mode in &quot;Street Fighter VI&quot; will not reference the fight between Ryu, Pikachu and Donkey Kong that took place on Samus Aran's spaceship.<br />So, yeah, different situation from Mario and New Donk City.</div>

There's evidence that the land belonged to the Goombas, the Toads were the invaders, and the Goombas hired mercenaries from Koopa Troop (cartoons: Koopa Pack) to reclaim their homeland. Of course this wouldn't be clear from the manual because it's written from the Toads' point of view. On the other hand, Bowser appears to have occupied Dinosaur Land for no reason other than Lebensraum.</div>Haha you do really like these theories. Very well, it adds an interesting twist to the discussion. The winners of war writes history they say. I don't believe in this theory of course, but that doesn't mean Nintendo technically can't retcon it and say that this is indeed the canon case.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">In this screenshot, they're noticeably shorter than Mario.</div>That's from the Famicom version. In the arcade version, Kaettekita Mario Bros and in the PAL exclusive Mario Bros Classic they are much fatter, but not much taller. They are still shorter than Mario but it's not that big of a difference. I don't think it necessarily means they are giant turtles but they couldn't draw them as small turtles either because, well I already explained why you can't draw characters  too small. And that leads directly to the next part:<br /><div class="quotetitle">tepples wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"><div class="quotetitle">Pokun wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">Video game logic, not everything is depicted in realistic proportions, especially if it would make it hard to see details in the low resolution the system provides, makes perfect sense to me.</div><br />Hence the large heads on <a href="https://allthetropes.org/wiki/Graphics_Induced_Super_Deformed" class="postlink">Graphics Induced Super Deformed</a> characters.</div>Yes and I strongly believe in this philosophy. Video game is art, and when it comes to art, logic comes second and feelings comes first. Art is a lot about expressing feelings after all. This is why I believe so much in what feels right here. Of course what I feel is right isn't necessarily the same as what Miyamoto and gang felt was right, so I could be totally wrong on my guesses (actually I'm most likely wrong on a lot of things here).<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">Yes, it is. But you shouldn't include it into a work that has already been established to have cartoon characters, unless it's some parody or satire, like &quot;South Park&quot;.</div>OK so you finally accepted realism is a genre of art. I find it a bit funny that you think realism has a place in characters' size proportions even if it would get in the way for the aesthetics, but you really don't like realism in character design to be mixed in. I guess what you don't like is just the fact that realism and SD characters are mixed.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">But mixing style implies that Mario is not a normal human...</div>Yeah you said the same things a number of times now.

Mario doesn't deal more damage with it. That's not like Bruce Banner becoming the Hulk.<br /></div>I really don't see what the exact effects of the power ups has to do with the discussion.

I also bought up those contradictions in the games and explained why I don't believe in them. I think the developers just changed this when it was convenient to do so (or there where confusion among the developers in the first place), but that doesn't mean much to me.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">Stuff like &quot;Super Smash Bros.&quot; is just a fanservicey non-canon crossover.

I used to think Smash Bros is just a non-canon crossover, but when I thought about the idea that they are toys that came to life I thought Smash Bros was its own canon. Of course they are not canon to each character's game (Smash Bros has no place in the Zelda timeline for example). That's why they are just stuffed toys (and later figurines and amiibo) of video game characters. But then Brawl even included a story mode to confirm that it indeed has a story. I view it as that they are toys/video game characters and Smash Bros is a crossover space where they can meet and do more or less friendly fights, much like the space where the video game characters in Wreck it Ralph go to to take a break from their video game roles (although they don't fight). But while Mario, Link and everyone are actors in their various games, the games still happens in their own worlds. So they are both actors and real at the same time, it's kind of the Yoshi Island mystery.<br />I think games like the Mario Kart series is also something like this.</div>

But I make the story and I would tell you: No, that's not the case, simply because I say so. I <em>created</em> this world, I'm not a person living inside it, trying to convince people that these harmless peasants are actually a gang.<br /><br />Same with the &quot;Super Mario&quot; games.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">Pokun wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">I guess what you don't like is just the fact that realism and SD characters are mixed.</div><br />I thought about it and I came to the conclusion: Mixing them is not a problem per se.<br /><br />In &quot;Asterix&quot;, you have cartoony style (most characters, Gallians and Romans), but you also have realistic style (Caesar, that blond Gallian woman and her boyfriend, various Roman people). So, the different styles are just individual properties of people.<br />Likewise, in an all-star game like &quot;Super Smash Bros.&quot;, you have many different styles anyway. <em>Everybody</em> looks differently.<br /><br />So, this is all nice and well.<br /><br />My problem is:<br /><br />For 36 years, the &quot;Mario&quot; universe had only cartoony human characters. And now, suddenly, they introduced realistic characters.<br /><br />This in itself wouldn't be an issue yet. Mario looks differently from Princess Toadstool, so a realistic guy wouldn't be out of place yet.<br /><br />But the problem is that the realistic characters are shown in one specific environment.<br />They don't mix and match styles randomly, like in &quot;Asterix&quot;, where both Romand and Gallians, men and women alter between realistic and cartoony.<br />In &quot;Super Mario Odyssey&quot;, <em>every</em> New Donk City resident is realistic. And realistic characters <em>only</em> appear in New Donk City.<br /><br />There's a method behind it. It's not just general mixing of styles in the same way the real world has tall, small, slim and fat people.<br />Since <em>no</em> character native to New Donk City looks like Mario and since <em>no</em> character not from New Donk City looks hyper realistic, it's not just a random mix like in &quot;Super Smash Bros.&quot; anymore. It's an actual in-universe difference just like certain places in the real world are inhabitated primarily by white people and other primarily by black people.<br /><br />Since there's such a clear-cut distinction, this imlies an actual racial or species difference. That's not just like with Asterix and Caesar, that's more like with Frodo and Legolas.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">Pokun wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">I really don't see what the exact effects of the power ups has to do with the discussion. It only matters that it increases Mario's strength, not in what exact manner it does so.</div><br />Mario uses the Super Mushroom in everyday situations: He starts like that in &quot;New Super Mario Bros.&quot; And Mario and Luigi's little intro scene in &quot;Super Mario Bros. 3&quot; has them in their super form, just like the story intro scenes in the Game Boy Advance remakes of SMB3 and SMW.<br />Hence, it is proven that Mario uses the Super Mushroom outside of fighting. Therefore, this isn't unlikely for the other characters to do so as well.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">Pokun wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">You really still think that the designer's intention in the left picture is &quot;in-universe, Toad is smaller than Mario, despite what the picture shows you&quot;?</div>Correct and I think I already explained why I think so.</div><br />Yeah, but your &quot;less details&quot; argument doesn't hold water when it comes to a huge artwork that's bigger than anything in the gameplay anyway and that is only there for artistic purposes and has no bearing on the gameplay.<br /><br />Your theory that the Mushroom Kingdom inhabitants are always in their small form and that Nintendo basically means &quot;They look like they're in their big form, but please simply pretend that they aren't&quot; has literally zero support from anything but your own personal head canon. There's <em>nothing</em> implying this even <em>slightly</em>, but there are countless examples where even Mario himself is in his Super form in regular everyday life.<br /><br />In SMB1 of &quot;All Stars&quot;, he even gets a Super Mushroom when he rescues the Princess in his small form, so that he matches her size. Then she kisses him and you see a huge artwork of that scene where they're still to scale to each other.<br />So, what do you think happened here? That Mario was regular sized, just like Princess Toadstool. Then he grew to a three meter tall giant while the Princess was still 1.60 m despite the sprites showing exactly the opposite? And then she kissed giant Mario and the drawn artwork <em>still</em> didn't show him as a giant and her as a dwarf, but we are supposed to assume that this is the case here?<br /><br />Sorry, but no. That's just ridiculous: &quot;Please completely ignore everything that's actually on-screen, from sprites to artworks to animated cutscenes, and consider a developers' intention that the developers never uttered at all, but that I made up in my head and seriously believe that this is what they had in mind.&quot;<br /><br />Compared to this theroy, every fan speculation about the family relations of Donkey Kong are scientific work.<br /><br />It's absolutely clear: In the Mushroom Kingdom, the Super form is the default everyday-life form for everybody.<br />The only unanswered question is: What is the nature of the two forms? Is the small form a weakened version, similar to an illness? Or is the small form the default birth form, but everybody just chooses to use the Super Mushroom for increased strength all the time?<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">Pokun wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">Oh let's discuss Smash Bros.</div><br />&quot;Super Smash Bros.&quot; is more like those educational cartoons where the Turtles, Archie and Bugs Bunny appear together to tell you that you should not pick up smoking: It's its own wacky crossover universe, but the plot happened in neither of the regular franchises. It's as canon as Robert Englund dressing up as Freddy Krueger and answering questions in-character in a talkshow. This event also has a &quot;story&quot;, but it's only &quot;canon&quot; to itself, not to the actual movies.</div>

It was probably easier to make small Mario small than to make Super Mario gigantic, either that or there was some kind of confusion of which his true form is supposed to be.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">Your theory that the Mushroom Kingdom inhabitants are always in their small form and that Nintendo basically means &quot;They look like they're in their big form, but please simply pretend that they aren't&quot; has literally zero support from anything but your own personal head canon. There's nothing implying this even slightly, but there are countless examples where even Mario himself is in his Super form in regular everyday life.</div>Well this is about my own beliefs, not what is canon as that isn't very clear when the games contradict themselves (especially the old manuals) and common fictional sense. You keep bringing up new &quot;proofs&quot; but I think I explained why I don't believe in them. I can say it again: I believe the developers are doing it for convenience, they don't care which is canon here they just did it because it looked good in that situation.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">It's absolutely clear: In the Mushroom Kingdom, the Super form is the default everyday-life form for everybody.<br />The only unanswered question is: What is the nature of the two forms? Is the small form a weakened version, similar to an illness? Or is the small form the default birth form, but everybody just chooses to use the Super Mushroom for increased strength all the time?</div>Well according to your own &quot;proof&quot; the big form is their natural form and the small form is the transformed form (just like for Wario). Recent games deforms Mario when he takes damage and make him normal when he grabs a mushroom, I don't think the squished form is supposed to be Mario's true form in these games.<br /><br />OK I have another explanation that even I might be able to accept one day, and it should also explain all those contradictions in games you bought up (retconning it, we will just have to ignore the old manuals' descriptions of &quot;Super&quot; though). There are no doubt many kinds of mushrooms in the Mushroom Kingdom as proven by many Mario games. Among them there are mushrooms that recovers strength (especially used in the Mario RPG series), there are mushrooms that turn you into a bee and there are mushrooms that makes you gigantic (the Mega Mushroom in NSMB series). The Super Mushroom, although it probably was initially supposed to be something like the Mega Mushroom, eventually turned out to become a recovery type of mushroom. The small Mario is, just like the small Wario, a comical representation of Mario having taken damage in battle. What do you think about this?<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">&quot;Super Smash Bros.&quot; is more like those educational cartoons where the Turtles, Archie and Bugs Bunny appear together to tell you that you should not pick up smoking: It's its own wacky crossover universe, but the plot happened in neither of the regular franchises. It's as canon as Robert Englund dressing up as Freddy Krueger and answering questions in-character in a talkshow. This event also has a &quot;story&quot;, but it's only &quot;canon&quot; to itself, not to the actual movies.</div>Well yeah that's pretty much what I meant to say, although it's official and not some third-party licensing of Nintendo characters.</div>

But they won't.

There is no &quot;how it <em>really</em> happened&quot; because nothing of it is real. What the developers tell you is the truth because them saying it makes it canon.<br /><br />The only times when you can disprove the word of the work's creator itself is in two instances:<br /><br />1. If it's about subjective stuff, like morals. So, when an author creates a character who rapes and pillages and enslaves people, then the author calling his character &quot;morally sound&quot; doesn't have to be the truth.<br />Ergo, if you want to claim that Mario is an asshole and not the nice hero, based on his behavior in certain games, go ahead.<br /><br />2. If the creator is obviously lying and contradicting the work itself. For example, if George Lucas said that Luke Skywalker is an African American woman, this would obviously be bullshit.<br /><br />But if Nintendo says &quot;The Koopa tribe attacked the Mushroom Kingdom&quot;, you cannot say: &quot;That's not true. The Mushroom people took the land away from the Koopas.&quot; Because Nintendo saying it already makes it true since they make the story.

The one thing that goes against it is the fact that in the earlier Mario games (before SMW at least) the super mushroom stacked with the better power ups and was even required (taking a flower in SMB when small, just transforms you into the big form without fireballs). The non-Japanese SMB3 even reverts Mario back to Super Mario instead of small Mario if taking a hit when having a second level power up, effectively giving him 3 hit points.<br /><br />Besides the naming of Mario and Super Mario in the old manuals the series has been quite consistent though.

Changes happens naturally as they develop the game.<br />Regarding the realism of sizes, you can think it's stupid how much you want, but the developers probably changes in-universe rules around whenever it's convenient and don't care about realism one bit. This is most likely the whole reason why there's so much inconsistency in the Mario series in the first place. I don't think realism is very important in fantasy fiction like this, on the contrary I generally shun it.</div>

So, the small one was the regular guy and the big one was the giant.<br /><br />In the new games, small Mario is a squished version of himself and only Super Mario looks natural.<br />Furthermore, the official heights imply that big Mario is the regular one because Bowser, who never grows through Super Mushrooms, is only slightly taller than Mario there, which is only true if Mario is big, and their heights are still in a realistic scale.<br /><br /><br />So, yeah, theorizing about that is absolutely legit.<br /><br />However, saying:<br />&quot;They <em>drew</em> the characters as big, but they <em>meant</em> them as small. Everybody except for Mario, that is. The Princess Toadstool sprite is 32 pixels and it's meant to be 1.60 m. The Super Mario sprite is only 27 pixels, but it's meant to be 3 m. The small Mario sprite, 16 pixels, is supposed to be 1.55 m.&quot;<br /><br />This one I call bullshit. Because that there's a conscious discrepancy between what is drawn and what is intended in-universe, even if it's not only about sprites, but also about artworks in the game, there's absolutely no reason to assume this.<br /><br />And this has nothing to do with realism or video game logic or whatever.<br />Drawing something and then saying: &quot;Yeah, ignore what I just drew. That doesn't count. It's in the game, but not inside the canon&quot;, that's so stupid.<br />Especially if it's not even &quot;Ignore what <em>I</em> just drew&quot;, but if it's a fan theory: &quot;Ignore what <em>they</em> drew.&quot;<br /><br /><br />Remember when they had a hard time drawing a mouth for the Mario sprite, so they opted for a mustache? Now imagine if they said: &quot;We drew him a mustache, but he doesn't actually have one in-universe. It was made out of convenience, but in canon, he's clean-shaven, although even the artworks show him with a mustache.&quot;<br /><br />They might have this or that motivation and they may draw something out of convenience. But as soon as they draw Super Mario to scale with all the other characters, that's what it becomes.<br /><br />You cannot claim that the Super Mario sprite that has fewer pixels than the Princess Toadstool sprite is <em>supposed</em> to be a character that towers at 3 m over Princess Toadstool, video game logic or not. If Luke Skywalker is clearly a white man, you cannot say he's a black woman.<br /><br />And if Princess Toadstool is shown taller than even Super Mario, then you cannot say that this very scene is <em>meant</em> to be her being much, much smaller. That's not how art works. Especially if the artist <em>never</em> ever claimed anything that sounded even <em>slightly</em> like this.<br /><br />Princess Toadstool is taller than Super Mario. That's an undeniable fact. It's in the game and even in artworks.<br />You can draw certain conclusions now:<br /><br />Small Mario is just a weakened form, Super Mario is the default.<br /><br />Mushroom Kingdom people always are Super by default.<br /><br />Mario is from Brooklyn, so the small form is his default, but for Mushroom Kingdom people, the big form is the default.<br /><br />But you cannot just ignore the obvious facts and say: &quot;The size match between Super Mario and the others: Yeah, that isn't really supposed to be there in the first place. You have to imagine the other characters as if they <em>had</em> been drawn small, even if they aren't.&quot;</div>

That's the point of believing.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">So, yeah, theorizing about that is absolutely legit.</div>OK thanks.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">And this has nothing to do with realism or video game logic or whatever.<br />Drawing something and then saying: &quot;Yeah, ignore what I just drew. That doesn't count. It's in the game, but not inside the canon&quot;, that's so stupid.</div>You think it's stupid but it makes perfect sense to me. Let's say you draw a human character in a (fairly) realistic style using a 16x16 metasprite, and then you want to draw a cat and a mouse in the same style. You probably can't fit a realistically proportioned cat and mouse in metasprites with the given resolution unless you sacrifice a lot of details. So let's say you don't want that, so you bend the rules a bit and draw them much bigger. The cat is almost half the size of the human and the mouse is not much smaller than the cat. In this case you would say: &quot;Yes ignore that, they are not supposed to be gigantic cats or mouses. I just drew them that way because I think it made it much more interesting to look at&quot;. Doesn't that sound perfectly reasonable although it's undeniably a conscious discrepancy between what is drawn and what is intended in-universe?<br /><br />Mario Bros enemies are turtles, crabs and even flies that are drawn almost the same size as Mario and Luigi for this reason. They are not real animals though but cartoon characters and they can get away bending the rules easier, but I still think that if for example the Sidestepper or Shellcreeper would show up in a 3D Mario game I would imagine that they could be drawn a bit smaller than they look compared to Mario in Mario Bros, simply because it might fit in better in the game that way, and because it's possible on a modern system. Besides in the artwork they are drawn much smaller than Mario and Luigi. You can say it's stupid but game developers are evidentially doing it all the time.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">Remember when they had a hard time drawing a mouth for the Mario sprite, so they opted for a mustache?

Of course ignoring the moustache's existence just because the resolution allows drawing a mouth would be bending the rules too far, his moustache is part of his character that people recognize after all. You have to be reasonable when bending the rules. Changing sizes a bit here and there (especially in games with a very low resolution) is what I'd consider as reasonable, changing Skywalker to a black woman is not.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">And if Princess Toadstool is shown taller than even Super Mario, then you cannot say that this very scene is meant to be her being much, much smaller.

OK AFAIK there are no canon material that explicitly says Mario isn't from Brooklyn so I guess that is still valid as a theory (I didn't knew that Brooklyn has mushroom shaped houses though).

						<div class="postbody">O.k., to make sure I didn't misunderstand you, let's put this together:<br /><br />Question 1:<br />In &quot;Super Mario Bros. 3&quot;, do you think that small Mario has regular size while Super Mario is a giant?<br />Or do you think that small Mario is a dwarf while Super Mario has regular size?<br /><br />Question 2:<br />In &quot;Super Mario Bros. 3&quot;, do you think that Princess Toadstool and Toad have regular size or are they giants?<br /><br />(With regular size I'm not talking about &quot;default&quot; size. Which one is the default is not important here. I'm talking about the actual absolute values. Regular size would be something like 1.55 m (or maybe 1.30 for Toad) to 2.10 m. Giant would mean 3 m and dwarf means 70 cm.)</div>
