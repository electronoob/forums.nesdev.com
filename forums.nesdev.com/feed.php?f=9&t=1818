I read in a document somewhere that it was possible to freeze games through the NMI on the expansion port. Maybe I read it wrond or the document itself was wrong, but it sounded like it would not be too hard. Oh well, I guess that one can be put to rest for now. I suppose the first thing is designing/finding a connector for that pesky port.<br /><br />I heard that in other projects pin 18 (am I correct?) on the cartridge port has been used in the past for audio expansion with converters, so I think that I could do that just for the sake of consistency.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=450">arfink</a> — Mon Jul 31, 2006 6:58 am</p><hr />

There's no /NMI access on the expansion port.  There is /IRQ though.  But the idea seems to fall apart considering that games can and do disable both NMIs and IRQs (despite NMI meaning non-maskable interrupt, it is maskable, heheh).  And if IRQs were enabled, holding it low would probably have severe side-effects depending on the game's code.  Doing a hardware pause this way is an uphill battle.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=10">Memblers</a> — Sun Jul 30, 2006 5:41 pm</p><hr />

Sounds good. So lets review here, people want this dongle to need/contain these things:<br /><br />audio re-routing from the cart<br /><br />a famicom-style DB15 expansion port<br /><br />a cartidge lockout chip that get rerouted through a homebrew cart to save on the number of real NES carts that need to get smashed to make said carts work<br /><br />an audio input and possibly an audio output<br /><br />an NMI based freeze / pause function<br /><br />anything else? I think all of this is quite do-able and could possibly be mass produced (not by me, remember!) once a source for the custom conector can be found.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=450">arfink</a> — Sat Jul 29, 2006 11:04 am</p><hr />

Just Breed has extanded audio, because the MMC5 has, and it can be freely used in Famicom territory.

An expansion port add-on was kind of like what I had in mind when designing Squeedo.  But I put it all on cart, since it seems more practical since it's a devcart with FlashROM anyways.  I think it's really best to only have memory + address decoding on cart.<br /><br />So what I think would be cool would be a (fast) microcontroller and a USB interface.  Would add somehthing like $12 to the build cost though.  I like the sound idea too.  Squeedo currently just sends the audio to the NES digitally (doesn't cost <em>too</em> much CPU time, really).  If I was gonna put a DAC on Squeedo for sound, I'd do it as a Famicom cart.  Unless these dongles would be cheap enough to include with Squeedo.  But that's no good for a top-loader.<br /><br />An FC expansion port like kyuusaku suggested is a good addition also.  Would only need a place to solder wires from a DB15 cable to it, I think.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=10">Memblers</a> — Fri Jul 28, 2006 6:35 pm</p><hr />

Yes, sounds like a relatively simple filter. I would like to see how this had been done. BTW, I was not aware that Just Breed had exteneded audio, I thought it was just a normal MMC5. I know Castlevania 3 is an MMC5 in america, but it is a special Konami mapper in Japan, and thats where the extended audio comes in.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=450">arfink</a> — Fri Jul 28, 2006 1:05 pm</p><hr />

In order to play FC audio to the NES you need to add one resitor, one capacitor in your NES and one wire in your FC2NES adapatator. I don't remember where this is proprely doccumented.

OK, OK, just to clarify things here. The main idea of this dongle is to make it so that a games like Akumajo Densetsu can have its extened audio when you play it on the NES. The idea of puting the CIC data through the expansion port is so that you only need to pillage ONE nes cart and you can use the CIC chip from that cart with any homebrew cart you build. Do you understand? I am thinking of ripping the CIC chip from a normal cartridge and putting it on the dongle and then running the nececary lines for the CIC into the cartridge that is in the slot, which presumably will not have a CIC sinve it is a hack / homebrew. You know, like Sqeedo (sp?), and instead of having  lockout chip in the cart it goes in the dongle instead. It would hog up a few of the cart slot to expansion slot pins, but it would be useful for people who want to mass produce different kinds of homebrew carts. And besides, if people can make totally custom mappers like Squeedo, who's to say nobody will want to integrate a audio chip? <br /><br />In short, this dongle could make some nice things possible, and could be easily expanded. If you made it with alot of features, even if they all don't get used right away, someone might make a cart that utilizes it. That is why I want to hear anyone and everyone's ideas on how to standardize this and what features should go into this. Also, I beleive that if some people could check the pitch and other meausrements of the expansion port that it would not be too challenging to get a similar part and then a little dremel modding would take care of the rest. Anyone with calipers want to do this, please?<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=450">arfink</a> — Tue Jul 25, 2006 7:32 pm</p><hr />

I think the only way building this device would be worth while would be for it to have a FC expansion port ($4017-D1..4 are available on the expansion port?)

Adding audio chips to a game would be so complicated that I doubt the homebrew community would be interested.  Especially with so few large scale homebrew games making it to completion anyway.<br /><br />The more I think about the audio in, the more I think that it's unnecessary complication.  I would much rather play a CD in my CD player while I play tetris rather than turn the sound to mono and route it through the nes.<br /><br />I really feel the sound adaptor is more useful to famicom games on the nes with a famicom to nes adaptor.  Then you would just put the CIC on the famicom to the nes adaptor so you wouldn't need to complicate things further.  The expansion port plug is basically one wire connectiong unless you want to add fc 4 player or other device support through the expansion port.<br /><br />I don't mean to tear up you ideas, but I'd like to open up more serious discussion.  How is your audio-in useful when you'd have to have some audio player to play the sound and then there is no way for the nes to control the audio player?  Also, are you thinking of mixing stereo sound into mono, or would you only send the right channel through the nes and have the left channel go directly to your speaker system or TV?<br /><br />Also, how will you then use the CIC when it's in the expansion port?  Unless you modify the nes, you would always have to use some sort of adaptor even for pirate nes games, correct?<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=231">sevast</a> — Fri Jul 21, 2006 9:49 pm</p><hr />
