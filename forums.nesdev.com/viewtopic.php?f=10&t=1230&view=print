At first I thought I should check all the pixels between 2 points, so I wouldn't miss a thing. But that seemed like a huge waste of time. In that project, the worlds are composed by 16x16-pixel blocks, so I just restrict movement to 16 pixels at a time. There is no way you'll miss a block like this. </div>
<br />Well imagine that your object is just seven pixels ahead of a wall, moving at 8 pixels a frame. Since the 8th pixel is solid, it won't moove and will keep 7 pixels ahead of the wall, wich is stupid. So, you have to check each pixels after eachother, so if a moove is copleted as far as it can.
<br />A cheap way to do that would be to first check for 8 pixels, then if it fails, check for 7, etc... But it doesn't sound very logical to me.
<br />Even if the monsters are typically not moving that fast, they do when they get hit and when they "jump back". Maybe this is less important in a platformer than in a topdown action-adventure game ?
<br />
<br />Of course, the objects getting the faster are the projectiles, and often you won't check wall for them. If you do, precision isn't needed, because the wall will destroy them, and I don't think the exact point where they're destroyed is significant for the player.

You could easily put the playe on the integer tile before the one the solid pixel is in. In my game, walls always obey the 16x16-pixel grid. If the players goes through a wall, put it at the square that's befoe the wall. It's simple.

Even if the walls are not aligned to any grid (they variate to the pixel level) You could still check how thick the wall is, then how far the player entered it, and just move back. Much faster than checking every pixel in the way.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">A cheap way to do that would be to first check for 8 pixels, then if it fails, check for 7, etc...

<br />I don't know, in this case I think it's the same. In fact it is easier for top-down games, as they (conceptually) have no floor, only walls.
<br />
<br />I don't think you need so much precision. Of course, the more precision the better, but not if it has a big impact on speed. I think that games from the 8 and 16-bit era hardly checked all pixels. I mean, I got stuck inside a wall in <em>Sonic the Hedgehog 3</em> a few times. Not that we should forgive this bug, but that shows that those games didn't check pixel by pixel, and most worked just fine.

That won't change the worst case speed, but most probably the typical speed. Or maybe go backwards in group of 2 or 4 pixels won't be noticeable ?
<br />And yeah, when the monster jump back this made them do 16 pixels at time, and I do check for all pixels one after eachother. The checking routine also checks if the monster never got out of the current screen. I think it is very high precision, and logical. Doing it a faster way, but have possible bugs would suck. Loose precision is okay, but not having glitches such as be screwed in a wall. I hate games with glitches.

<br />
<br />I've always done it like this in past games/demos not related to the NES: I first incremented the player's X coordinate with the X  acceleration/speed variable. Then, depending on the direction of the movement (left or right) I checked specific points for collision. The points were integer divided by 16 (if the bg is aligned to the 16x16 grid the remainder of the division won't matter at all, so shifting right 4 times will do the job) and that position in the map was checked. If it was a solid block, the player's position was set back to as close as it could from the block. The remainder of the division by 16 could be used for this, as it represents the ammount of pixels the player was into the block, just subtract that from the player's position. If the movement was to the right, subtracting the remainder will do, but if moving left, you'd have to add the complement of the remainder (16 - remainder), although the 6502 would allow us to use a generic trick here, no matter the direction.
<br />
<br />The same should be performed for the Y axis. In the case of my platformer, if the player got inside a floor or ceiling block, I check it's height map to see if the specific pixel the player is in is low enough to allow it to be there anyway. If not, I put the player right above the pixel so it'll stand in the right place.
<br />
<br />I don't see how that wold intoduce gliches. I haven't implemented a full engine with this, though. That's how I'm planning to do my game.

<br />
<br />Tokumaru : I didn't fully understand what you're saying here.
<br />Okay, to check on wich metatile the player is, you need to do a 4-bit shiftright (division by 16) division while checking block solidity. But I didn't understand what you were saying with the remainder. It would tell the distance between the wall and the player ? By how miracle ?
<br />Also, the collision detection isn't that simple. For all stuff I check 4 points, topleft, topright, bottomleft and bottomright. All 4 have to collid nothing, else the collision fail.
<br />If the player goes up, it is useless to check bottomleft and bottomright, as it is useless to check bottomright and topright when going left. So this add a lot of simplicity when the player/monster is going to a single direciton at time.
<br />I use that trick for the player, but not for ennemies, because their AI is made in a way it was simpler to do so. Also, I move the player 2 pixels, then 1 pixels, then 2 again, etc.... When moving of 2 pixels, I don't check for collision for the first pixel, so it should work fine with 2 pixel precision.
<br />When the player moves diagonal, I check for horizontal and vertical deplacement separately and it works fine.
<br />
<br />Maybe for 4 it would be decent, but for 8 or 16 it would be undecent.
<br />

<br />That's probably what I hate about Mario Bross. When you entnter in a wall, you look ejected from it. I just have that system, to time your jump and move straightly it just suck in my opinion.
<br />Also, the first MegaMan seems to push player and objects to the block to the right if he's in a solid block. It will ususally never happen, but glitches in the game make it happen.
<br />When you kill a monster in a wall, if he throws an item, it will move to a block per frame.
<br />
<br />EDIT : When the player is one pixel ahed of a solid block, and if it will be an odd frame so it moves two pixels, the collision check will fail, making it not move at all. But, the next frame will be an even one, and it will move of one pixel, and the collision check will sucess. So this don't create bugs. However, it wouldn't work if it was constantly moving of 2 pixels.

<br />If sonic does not move more than the base unit in the level it can get away with it, in my opinion. In the Master System versions, Sonic never goes faster than 16 pixels in a frame, and the levels are based on 32x32-pixel blocks, so it's safe. The Genesis/Mega Drive levels are based on 16x16-pixel blocks, and I'd guess Sonic does move faster than that sometimes. I don't know how they handle that. Maybe checking a fer points along the way? I doubt they check all.

Better yet, AND the player's coordinate with %00001111 to get the lower bits before you shift them off. Those 4 will tell you how far the player is in the block. Say we have a very smal level composed by 2 16x16 pixel blocks. The fist one is empty and the second is solid. The player is at position (8, 8) and tries to move 12 pixels to the right. That would place it at point (20, 8). You take the 20 and divide by 16, wich will result in 1, with 4 as remainder. Dividing the Y coordinate by 16 will result in 0. The position (1, 0) in the map is a solid block, meaning the player can not enter it. The number 4 (remainder) represents how many pixels in the block the player is. Since position 4 is the 5th pixel inside the solid block, if you subtract 5 from the player now you'll make sure it is as close to the solid block as possible, but remain at block (0, 0).<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">Also, the collision detection isn't that simple.

<br />As far as I remember you don't actually <strong>see</strong> anything beeing pushed back, as this step should be done before rendering the sprites.

<br />That's still a bunch of checks. If you hit a wall, there is no need to check other pixels. You know how thich the wall is. And can easily tell how far inside the wall the point is. It is trivial to push the player back only enough to have him just touch the wall.
<br />
<br />The problem is that not always preventing the problems is the best way. Many times it is better to let the problems happen, and then fix them.

<br />Oh yes, it does !
<br />When you're under a block like this :
<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">+-------+++++++++<br />|&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;|++???+++<br />|&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;|+?+++?++<br />|&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;|++++?+++<br />|&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;|+++?++++<br />|&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;|++++++++<br />+-------++++?++++<br />|&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; P&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; +<br />|&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; l&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; +<br />|&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; a&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; +<br />|&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; y&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; +<br />|&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; e&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; +<br />|&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; r&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; +<br />+---------------+</div>
<br />and when you jump, Mario kind of jump back when he jump. Jumping above the mentionned block become so much very hard ! That's anoying. Aother anoying thing in contol is variable player speed. Mario accelerate so much slowly, and take so much time to stop, it's horrible.
<br />
<br />I'll try your reject technique someday. Since you apply it to both cordinates (as mario seems to don't), it won't cause problems. I think it is especially interesting for monster, that can have variable speeds.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I can see one problem with my method, though. Suppose the player is trying to move like this:
<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">P = one of the player's &quot;contact points&quot;<br />o = desired destination<br />S = solid block<br /><br />+------+------+<br />|&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; | o&nbsp; &nbsp; |<br />|&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; |/&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;|<br />|&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; /&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; |<br />+-----/+------+<br />|&nbsp; &nbsp; P |SSSSSS|<br />|&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; |SSSSSS|<br />|&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; |SSSSSS|<br />+------+------+</div><br /><br />And you'd first try to move in the X axis:<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">+------+------+<br />|&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; | o&nbsp; &nbsp; |<br />|&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; |&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; |<br />|&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; |&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; |<br />+------+------+<br />|&nbsp; &nbsp; P---XSSSS|<br />|&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; |SSSSSS|<br />|&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; |SSSSSS|<br />+------+------+</div><br /><br />That would fail, as you'd be inside the block. The player would then be pushed back, and we'd check for the vertical movement:<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">+------+------+<br />|&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;X| o&nbsp; &nbsp; |<br />|&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;||&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; |<br />|&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;||&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; |<br />+-----|+------+<br />|&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;P|SSSSSS|<br />|&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; |SSSSSS|<br />|&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; |SSSSSS|<br />+------+------+</div><br /><br />This one is OK, so the player would end up here:<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">+------+------+<br />|&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;P| o&nbsp; &nbsp; |<br />|&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; |&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; |<br />|&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; |&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; |<br />+------+------+<br />|&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; |SSSSSS|<br />|&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; |SSSSSS|<br />|&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; |SSSSSS|<br />+------+------+</div>
<br />Instead of at the desired destination, wich would be perfectly possible. This is not such a big problem, and I doubt the player will notice any glitches. But I'm still trying to fix this anyway. If I had checked the axis in a different order (first Y and then X), the movement would work as expect. Maybe there is a way to decide what axis should be checked first, to avoid this problem. I'll think of something.

<br />Let's see you go out on the track, instantly accelerate to 1.5 pixels per frame or 5.6 meters per second or 12.5 miles per hour as fast as Mario does, and then stop on a dime. It's Luigi that has trouble stopping anyway.
<br />
<br />tokumaru: Are you trying to move that far in one frame? And why should tripping the player's foot on the corner of the block stop the player's horizontal movement dead? Shouldn't it cause the player to fall forward?

<br />
<br />Even platformers, that I like so much, and many 16-bit games have no acceleration and such. I have always been a little bothered by this.
