<br />1. MAD-1 #4

<br />3. GND
<br />4. ROM 3(00-3F/80-BF:8000-FFFF)

<br />The rest is basically what kind of memory you decide to use for the rom. ROM 1 and 2 are hooked up like hi-rom games (use A15) and ROM 3 would be hooked up like lo-rom (ignore A15).

<br />Hello kyuusaku,
<br />
<br />sorry for replying to such an old post of you, but I'm not quite sure if there's an error in your schematic.
<br />
<br />I tried to check the truth tables for it and came up with the following problem.
<br />
<br />EDIT: I found an error in my verification after I posted, so I deleted my findings from this post! Going to recheck it, please ignore my comment for now <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />
<br />
<br />So far thank you for your great circuit <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":-)" title="Smile" /> If I really find an error, I'll let you know.
<br />
<br />Thanks!

This idea is really interesting, as I'd love to be able to make a Star Ocean repro without using a SO donor. I pm'd shadowkn55, but its been so long he doesnt have the documentation anymore (although he did send me the GD3 header info, thanks!). I was just wondering if anyone on here had tinkered with this any more and got it working properly? Or better yet does anyone have the already re-arranged Star Ocean file anymore? <img src="./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" />

I guess the only way to test this SMC file should be making a customized cartridge which supports 95Mbits, right?

That one is weird as hell.<br /><br />&gt; ... considering that $7E-7F:$0000-FFFF is the WRAM and it must be blank.<br /><br />This confuses everyone.<br /><br />Real carts are comprised of logic chips to test and select lines, and they utilize the /CART line which is low for 00-3f,80-bf:8000-ffff, 40-7d,c0-ff:0000-ffff.<br /><br />My maps describe layouts, and try and do so with simple maskable conditions. Eg $00-7f:8000-ffff's range can be tested via: if((addr &amp; 0x808000) == 0x008000) ...;<br /><br />My maps are designed for emulation usage, as simulating the logic chips would be too slow, and describing them would be ridiculously hard, let alone others understanding them.<br /><br />So the idea with my maps are that conflict regions aren't going to occur on real carts, so don't support allowing them. If you are iterating through my list, then you decode WRAM first. If you are building a table of mapped ranges, then you map WRAM last. Either way, banks $7e-7f are always WRAM, regardless of what the map says. The map only looks that way so that the address masks are simpler.

I forget who, someone wants to make a SO using a standard cartridge format without special chips?<br /><br />I am in the process of designing my own cartridge so it wouldn't be too crazy to look into this..... If enough people were interested.<br /><br />Or have I completely missed the point?</div><br /><br />Yes, you got the point. Besides, it's the kind of technical challenge that I like to face.<br />I'm already designing a board with 3 flash memories, but there are some room limitations that I will have to overcome.

Or is that not an issue if the cart is made correctly, would the code run as-is?<br /><br />I would think you could get 3 tsop adapters inside it. I've seen pic's of your board ( I think ) , you use a 16 bit 32m EPROM, right?    <br /><br />Or maybe easier is to mount 2 tsop on 1 adapter board..... Or for that matter, have all 3 on an adapter board (no longer compliant with the 36 pin mask)  with decoder also on the adapter....<br />Just thinking out loud....
