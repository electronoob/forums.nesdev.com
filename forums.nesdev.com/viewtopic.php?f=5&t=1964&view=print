<br />
<br />Actually, I would suggest that <strong>you</strong> "shaddup". You're being an ass, and it isn't appreciated. If a post is offtopic, there's no need to say "What the hell does this have to do with [topic]" - that's just plain rude; if you want to suggest that it be moved to a different forum, a simple "This seems to be drifting offtopic - could a mod move it to [forum]?" would be highly preferred.
