Most of <a href="https://pineight.com/nes/" class="postlink">my work</a> is, as is every NES game by Shiru other than his port of Alter Ego. See the GNU essay &quot;<a href="https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/selling.html" class="postlink">Selling Free Software</a>&quot;.<br /><br />If you're thinking of the lockout chip and an early judgment against Tengen, that related to patents and to how it had obtained the 10NES source code by (allegedly) defrauding the Copyright Office. The patents have since expired, and current CIC clones are based on a nonfraudulent reverse engineering of the existing lockout chips; <em>Sega v. Accolade</em> and <em>Lexmark v. Static Control</em> appear to govern.<br /><br />Sometimes it's easier for us to answer your questions if you can think of a particular attack against the legality of selling your own homebrew. Under what legal theory did you believe it might be unlawful?

Everything from the lockout chip situation to the legal standings of homebrew development in general.<br /><br />I know Atari, when they created the 2600 had no specific requirements for licensing, but Nintendo did. I am looking to make sure that I am covered completely when I do to develop a game.<br /><br />When did the patents expire? If so, then what about copyrights? Again, please clarify.<br /><br />Thx.

As tepples pointed out, the CIC patent has expired, so that's not a problem.<br /><br />Copyright is your only real issue. If you made the content, you're fine. If you didn't, you should have an explicit license to sell it.<br /><br /><br /><br />If you want info on the CIC patent, Wikipedia can get you started: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CIC_%28Nintendo%29" class="postlink">CIC (Nintendo)</a><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">The patent covering the 10NES expired on January 24, 2006, although the copyright is still in effect.</div><br />What this means, specifically, is that you can legally clone the CIC now that the patent is expired, event though you can't make an identical copy of it (the copyright has not expired). The CIClone is a legal clone.

A functional, legal clone would either use newly written code (i.e. not copied) or an alternative method to circumvent the CIC.

Lexmark tried a similar lockout chip system with toner cartridges for its printers but <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lexmark_Int%27l_v._Static_Control_Components" class="postlink">lost in the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals</a>. Oracle tried enforcing copyright on the Java Standard Edition API but likewise <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oracle_v._Google" class="postlink">lost in a U.S. district court</a>.

A copy, on the other hand, would use the same implementation too.<br /><br />This is similar to why gameplay design almost never falls under copyright. The recent &quot;Princess Rescue&quot; 2600 game that got cease and desisted would have been fine to sell if they hadn't based every element of its graphics and music on Super Mario Bros.

After reading all of this I have come to the conclusion of the following:<br /><br />As long as the content I create is of my own (graphics, sound, code, etc.), then all will be well.<br /><br />I know the NES-101 rids us of the 'lock-out' chip, so naturally mostly all Homebrew/Unlicensed titles are able to be played on THAT version of the NES, but where the original NES stands WITH said 'lock-out' chip.. again, because the patents have expired makes not again for me even trying to work around THAT thing, but whatever floats your boat I guess.
