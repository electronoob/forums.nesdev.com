		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Aha, I think I see what's going on.
<br />Apparently, something is going haywire in my CPU when I get an interrupt in the middle of a BRK instruction - it's supposed to switch vectors to the active interrupt (but still push flags as if it was a BRK), but somehow it's loading the <strong>reset</strong> vector instead of NMI.
<br />
<br />[edit]
<br />
<br />Yep, sure enough. Not quite sure what I was thinking when I wrote this part:
<br />
<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">static&nbsp; &nbsp;__forceinline void&nbsp; &nbsp;IN_BRK &#40;void&#41;<br />&#123;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;CPU_MemGet&#40;CPU.PC&#41;;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;Push&#40;CPU.PCH&#41;;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;Push&#40;CPU.PCL&#41;;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;CPU_JoinFlags&#40;&#41;;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;Push&#40;CPU.P | 0x10&#41;;<br />#ifndef NSFPLAYER<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;if &#40;CPU.WantNMI&#41;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&#123;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;CPU.WantNMI = FALSE;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;CPU.PCL = CPU_MemGet&#40;0xFFFC&#41;;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;CPU.PCH = CPU_MemGet&#40;0xFFFD&#41;;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&#125;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;else<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&#123;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;CPU.FI = 1;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;CPU.PCL = CPU_MemGet&#40;0xFFFE&#41;;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;CPU.PCH = CPU_MemGet&#40;0xFFFF&#41;;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&#125;<br />#else<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;CPU.FI = 1;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;CPU.PCL = CPU_MemGet&#40;0xFFFE&#41;;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;CPU.PCH = CPU_MemGet&#40;0xFFFF&#41;;<br />#endif<br />&#125;<br /></div>
<br />
<br />That should be 0xFFFA/0xFFFB in the WantNMI section. That, and the "CPU.FI = 1;" part should be handled for all interrupt modes. Neat, though, that your test happened to uncover an obscure bug in my CPU code entirely by accident.

<br />
<br />they are part of the undocumented opcodes.  nintendo does use them or support them.  some might be from another programming manual that was from the c64 or something.  they worked there.  but every possible opcode will do something, including jam or halt.
<br />
<br />look on the nesdev site and the undocumented opcodes.

<br />They are unofficial opcodes that the NES (<em>my</em> NES, anyway, and apparently Quietust's) recognize. I've encountered some games that use them, so I added them to my emulator and this timing test. I've encountered only a few that use other undocumented instructions, but I haven't investigated those much yet. Read the readme.txt where I list these NOPs and their lengths.
<br />
<br />BTW, mattmatteh, each version of the test tests the same thing, just I was making slight changes to the framework to help find bugs in yours and Quietust's emulators. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_twisted.gif" alt=":twisted:" title="Twisted Evil" />
<br />
<br />I should add that I wrote this timing test partly because I found some really lame timing errors in my CPU emulator a few days ago. I hadn't realized that STA and similar do <em>not</em> have an extra cycle for page crossing in the indexed addressing modes. Fixing that unfortunetely broke a bunch of my movies, so I wanted to be sure I didn't have anything else like that.

<br />I don't know - I checked it at work during a break (using sourcecode downloaded from my website), and I won't have a chance to fix and recompile until I get home in about 2 hours. Hopefully, though, it'll work properly.
<br />
<br />[edit]
<br />
<br />Just fixed the bug and reran the ROM - passed with flying colors. Er, with a black and white "PASSED" message.

<br />On the boring old topic of "undocumented" opcodes: yes, at least in the 2 revisions of the NES i have tested (front- and top-loading NTSC), the unallocated portion of the opcode space does contain the much-lamented illegal/undocumented/etc. instructions. As has been stated before, they are undefined and implementation (i.e. die design) specific, and i'm sure NCL would not allow their use back in the days of NES game approval.
<br />"Reserved for future use" essentially translates to "Future behaviour not guaranteed". Future behaviour usually is the result of circuitry redesign or changes in manufacturing processes.
<br />Nice work, blargg.

<br />I found that most of them were identical to the C=64 6510 undocumented ops. If you stay away from the 0x2h HLT opcodes, most of them are stable.
<br />Though admittedly, as you've noted, nearly none are required for accurate reproduction of released NES titles.

<br />
<br />Err, "cycle table"? My emulator's CPU core doesn't have any "cycle tables" in it - it emulates every instruction as a series of memory accesses, each of which updates the PPU and APU states. I knew that my instruction timing was correct to begin with (from running previous tests), but I ran blargg's test ROM anyways just to make sure that it was working properly - little did I know that it would turn up an obscure bug in my BRK instruction emulation.
