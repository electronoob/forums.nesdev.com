		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />How about using <strong>BNROM</strong> for the horizontal/vertical mirroring variants and <strong>AxROM</strong> for the single screen variants? iNES 2.0 submapper codes would indicate that the ROM actually belongs in this single chip cart, but emulators not aware of this cart or even iNES 2.0 would still run the games (as long as the programmer didn't abuse the mirroring, in which case an emulator aware of the single chip cart would have to be used). This is the cleanest solution I can think of.<br /><br />EDIT: Well, there's still the problem that the iNES header doesn't allow the selection of which name table to use with single screen mirroring on AxROM, since this is controlled by the mapper. Would repurposing the H/V bit (which would only work on emulators aware of the single chip cart, to be compatible with AxROM the game would have to perform a mapper write to select a name table) be as frowned upon as repurposing the 4-screen bit like nocash suggested?

Accessing $0000 will be the same as accessing $2000 no matter what you do. In practice, you could do all your VRAM updating (except for palettes) using $0000-$07FF, half of it being for patterns and the other half for a name table. If you do that, however, games won't work with mappers 0 or 7, or any other mapper really (except the newly created 218).

I tried to make it flexible enough to work with different games, hence to options for using A10, A11, A12, or A13, with their advantages as described at the begin of this thread.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">you could do all your VRAM updating (except for palettes) using $0000-$07FF</div><br />Yup, for A10. Or elsewhere when using A11-A13. Of course it would be a bit weird to make a program that does actually <strong>rely</strong> on that mapping - more commonly one would access the name table at 2000h, as usually.<br />Still, for testing/developing games, it'd be nice if the emulator reproduce the exact mirroring. Not sooo much for intentionally using uncommon mirrors, but for seeing problems when accidently smashing something by writes to mirrors.<br /><br />When making single-chip games, my focus on the mapper number would be to indicate that - hey - this thing works without memory mapping hardware and without CHR ROM/RAM! Declaring it as AOROM with CHR-RAM and mapping hardware would be somehow masquerading the programming efforts needing for squeezing into NT memory.<br /><br />Allowing the game to run on older emulators would be nice, too. You could just release a second version of the game that works as normal NROM or AOROM or some other widely supported mapper type.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I was thinking some more about the 4 mirroring modes, and came to the conclusion that connecting A13 to CIRAM A10 isn't so versatile, because it doesn't allow parts of the name table to be used for patterns. When accessing $0000-$1FFF (A13 low) the lower 1KB is always selected, meaning that only this part of the memory can be used for patterns. Accessing $2000-$2FFF (A13 high) is the only way to access the upper 1KB, which is always used as a name table.<br /><br />By connecting A12 to CIRAM A10 however, you can actually use $0000-$0FFF for patterns in the lower 1KB (which is also where the name table will be), and $1000-$1FFF for patterns in the upper 1KB. So if you set the background to fetch tiles from $1xxx and use 8x16 sprites, you can use a few extra tiles from $0xxx for sprites.<br /><br />A11 and A10 are more restrictive in terms of scrolling (you'd scroll into the patterns if you scrolled both vertically and horizontally), but they're more versatile in terms of tile usage. Even if you use 8x8 sprites, you can still easily access patterns anywhere in the 2KB of RAM available, and these tiles can be used for sprites and backgrounds.<br /><br />After considering all this, I'd probably use horizontal mirroring (A11) or single screen A (A12) in a project that used this mapper, in order to have the possibility of trading name table bytes for extra patterns, while still being able to scroll horizontally.<br /><br />Anyway, my point is that although A13 provides the cleanest configuration (with complete separation of patterns and name tables), this configuration happens to be the one that doesn't offer the possibility of reallocating resources, so I'm not sure it would be the &quot;most common case&quot;, as it says in the OP.
