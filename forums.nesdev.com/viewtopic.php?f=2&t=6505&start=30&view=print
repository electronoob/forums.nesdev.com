<br />(Please excuse some slight off-topicness)
<br />
<br />Hey, I recognize that number! That's how high vertical levels are in Super Mario World. I've always found that choice quite odd, seeing as it's such an uneven number and makes X/Y coordinate to RAM address calculations less efficient.
<br />
<br />...and now you tell me that SMB3 has the same odd level height?
<br />
<br />Why? What's so special about the number 27? Did they pick a random number and simply decided to stick with it, or is there some brilliant reason I'm missing here?

<br />The NES has 2 name tables, and each one is 30 tiles (240 pixels) tall. In SMB3 they are arranged one on top of the other for a total of 60 tiles. The bottommost 6 rows are used for the status bar, which means that 54 are free for the level, enough for 27 metatiles.
<br />
<br />On the SNES I'm not sure. I don't think background maps are 30 tiles tall on the SNES, so I see no reason for them to stick with that limitation. Maybe that game was built on top of SM3, and they simply never changed that aspect of the engine.

<br />The water in the 2nd one changes physics when you're in it, and even does this for the enemies that are in it.  It also fades out nicely too instead of snapping or something when you get to the next screen.

<br />It appears they are modifying the scroll too early, which causes what's supposed to be the first scanline of the new area to show up all glitched, and after the Y scroll is incremented at the end of that scanline the one that's supposed to be the second one shows up where the first one should be, shifting everything up by 1 scanline.
<br />
<br />I know that back then compiling and testing a new build didn't take a second like it does nowadays, but leaving that kind of glitch in is a very sloppy thing to do. If they couldn't calculate how many cycles to wait based on where the scroll was being visually changed and fix the problem right away, they could at least have adjusted a cycle-killing loop gradually across builds made to test other things. That's a very serious bug IMO, and no programmer should settle for that kind of glitch, especially if it can be fixed so easily.

<br />Well, in the PAL version this is worse - the whole screen completely flickers and this boss is almost unbeatable, and yes, using an official cartridge, official NES, etc... I even tried 2 different cartridges to be sure but the glitch is present in both of them.
<br />
<br />I guess they fixed this in the PRG1 verison (both cartridge I have are PRG0), but anyway THIS is innacetpable. I agree minor glitches are lame, but a major flicker that makes you unable to see what happens on the screen is REALLY inacceptable. Can't belive Nintnedo put their seal of squality on it.

Man, not adapting raster effects when converting software to PAL is a huge FAIL. But seeing as they didn't even get them right on the NTSC version this is not such a big surprise.

Capcom however is one of the first company to fixes the music for PAL - Mega Man 1 already fix it - tempo AND pitch. Other companies started to do that ~1989 I guess.
<br />
<br />However, the tempo fix in MM3 creates errors with Proto Man's whistle - when proto man appears in one of the stage, the whistle "continue" and you hear some more notes - which are supposed to be only heard in the ending.
<br />
<br />I will also mention that a lot of sound effecs in Mega Man 1 (E) and Mega Man 2 (E) sounds completely wrong, because the messed up something in the pitch fix, where pitch to high would result in a low tune. It's another fail, though not as big as the end boss of Mega Man 3.

<br />I disagree. I didn't care until now because I figured it was just an emulator error, but to know that this actually happens on hardware is outrageous. I would certainly have questioned this as a kid. I would eventually let go, of course, but that's too weird to go unnoticed.

The PAL version who knows. Back in its day I believe I played through all of MM3. I never noticed or got annoyed by it. And in many NES games there are odd little glitches but it's no big deal, so long as the game works, doesn't crash, and the graphics don't become corrupted and the player can't continue.

<br />
<br />Companies not willing to spend the money on additional man hours and delaying the release of a project because it isn't 100% glitch free.  That's not unacceptable or unbelievable, it's common practice in every professional environment.
<br />
<br />Perfection is not cost effective.  Gamers of the late 80s / early 90s didn't care if a scanline flickered, so why would a game company spend thousands of dollars (or more) to fix it?
<br />
<br />It's easy to be ideological about game releases when you're not confronted with the fiscal reality of it.
<br />
<br />Hobbyists have the luxury of being perfectionists because they're on nobody's timetable but their own.  In the professional world, if you get hung up on minor details like this, then you don't finish the actual product.

<br />
<br />You're in the minority.  MM3 was an extremely popular game.  Lots of people payed good money for it back in the day, and it is still enjoyed by a relatively large audience even today.
<br />
<br />Glitched graphics and all.
<br />
<br />Most people simply don't care.  If they even notice.
<br />
<br />And since people "accept" the game and enjoy it, that by definition makes it "acceptable".
<br />
<br />
<br />EDIT:  of course "Acceptable" is competely subjective.  Perhaps your standards are just higher.
<br />
<br />I guess what I'm saying is... your standards are unreasonably high.
<br />
<br />I see people on these boards talking about how they wouldn't be satisfied if <em>one pixel</em> was out of place in a scene.  I don't know if you're one of them... but that's kind of the vibe I'm picking up.
<br />
<br />There's just no way that such attention is cost effective in the commercial world.
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />EDIT2:
<br />
<br />Real world example:
<br />
<br />I know these 2 guys on IRC.  kuja_killer and Sivak.
<br />
<br />kuja_killer is making this awesome MM3 hack.  He's ripped apart the engine, whole new levels, added MMX style E-tanks, redid all the menus, added SRAM, MMX style Heart Tanks, new graphics, etc.  He even switched to MMC5 and is using extended attributes.
<br />
<br />He isn't happy until he's iron out every little imperfection.  He even optimises code that doesn't really need to be optimised.
<br />
<br />
<br />Meanwhile... Sivak has coded and released what... like 4 or 5 games?  At least one of which was put on a cart and sold online and became popular worldwide (in niche circles).
<br />
<br />So Sivak is finishing stuff, <em>and making coin</em> in a fraction of the time.
<br />
<br />
<br />kuja's been at it for years.  He's not even halfway done yet.  He sometimes jokes that he'll never be finished.
<br />
<br />Sivak is working on his next game.  He's got a marketing plan for that one too, I think.  I even heard him talking about the game he's going to do after that.
