GBA emulators I've tried seems to have poor sound quality as well. Is this because of inacurate emulation, or does GBA games require clever filtering to sound good ?

<br />That fails unless your PC's sample rate is an integral multiple of the GBA's rate. If they differ, then the audio <em>must</em> be resampled for the PC's rate (otherwise it'll come out the wrong pitch and too fast/slow). So it's a question of how it's resampled. If it's done without interpolation, then you introduce lots of artifacts not present in the original, which I think is what the original poster was trying to eliminate. Maybe someone can do a comparison of sound quality from GBA, VBA-M, and Highly Advanced for the same clip of music.

<br />
<br />Ideally I would set the player's sample rate to a multiple of the GBA's sample rate, but I guess the sample rate varies in function the game, and some even varies the sample rate dynamicly in a song, so this is almost impossible.
<br />
<br />In the worst case the output of the GBA sound is reasmpled to fit winamp's sample rate, and winamp's output is resampled by the PC's sound cart to be merged with other sound sources. However I guess the sound cart does things so that this resampling is not audible with clever and modern algorithms, as this is it's only role (among with being a rarely used MIDI synthethiser).

The GBA has a pulse-width modulation digital to analog converter (PWM DAC) whose native rate is usually 65536 Hz.[1] VBA sounds OK at 44100 Hz because most games don't use more than 16 kHz, 18 kHz, or 21 kHz for their mixers, and the GBA resamples that to 65536 Hz internally using nearest neighbor. Since Windows 2000, most PC sound cards can resample a 65536 Hz stream down to the 48000 Hz or 96000 Hz that the card expects, whether in hardware or in the driver.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">blargg wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">So it's a question of how it's resampled.

<br />One common solution when trying to handle old consoles that used nearest-neighbor resampling is to render at 4 times the desired frequency, then low-pass filter and decimate. Sometimes this low-pass filter is a simple box filter (blargg's "merely averaging samples for the output sample period"); sometimes it's more complicated like a Chebyshev IIR low-pass filter.
<br />
<br />Blargg has developed a more sophisticated algorithm called Blip Buffer. It involves rendering the waveform at full rate (e.g. 65536 Hz for GBA or 39375000/22 Hz for NES), taking the first difference of the output, and then reintegrating using one of a set of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heaviside_step_function" class="postlink">Heaviside step functions</a> that have been delayed by a fraction of an output sample and then filtered. (This works because there is a closed form formula for a low-pass filtered Heaviside step function, called the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trigonometric_integral" class="postlink">sine integral</a>.) Because this first difference is zero at most points in the waveform, the algorithm is efficient. In fact, it allows adding an equalizer at negligible additional CPU cost because the equalizer would just be run on the Heaviside kernels.
<br />
<br /><span style="font-size: 75%; line-height: normal">[1] Selectable from 1024*x Hz, where x in [32, 64, 128, 256] Hz, where the PWM DAC has a depth of [9, 8, 7, 6] bits respectively. A lot of games use 65536 Hz because the resulting 8-bit DAC matches the 8-bit output of the game's mixer.</span>

<br />
<br />Version 0.08
<br />* Added GBA CPU usage display
<br />
<br />For some reason, anything that fucks with the KBPS display in Winamp messes with the sound quality. It isn't just this plugin (I've tried a few others that have options to turn the CPU display on/off), but this one is the only one I have that doesn't allow turning it off.
<br />
<br />It should be a simple fix, so I'm curious if it could be added in a minor update?
