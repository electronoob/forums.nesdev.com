I hope that artists become interested in creating HD remakes, like Marcelo Barbosa has done for Alex Kidd in Miracle World using HiSMS.<br /><br />  The sprite sheets for Super Mario Bros are fairly simple, so it's not an overwhelming project for an artist. Kung Fu and other early NES releases are the same way. And the characters of NES games tend to have very simple animation in general.<br /><br />   I'd love to take a closer look, but I can't get either HDNes or HiSMS working on my Mac using Wine. I believe that HiSMS doesn't work because it uses Direct3D 7 (rather than 8 or so). Not sure about HDNes.<br /><br />   Perhaps you could post a ZIP of graphics from an NES game, as ripped by HDNes, along with any remade graphics you've done?<br /><br />   I can see artists trying graphic packs for Super Mario Bros resembling New Super Mario Bros, Paper Mario or an animated style.<br /><br />   There is a lot of potential for 8-bit remakes.

An 8-bit remake could look very slick with renders like that! Which could also be taken from the newer-gen games themselves. I spotted models from Bubble Bobble, Adventure Island and so on - since those have been remade.<br /><br />I did some quick tests trying to rig Birdo and Waluigi in Poser. Not my strong suit!

Currently  it slows down if there are many different tiles on the screen. &quot;b&quot; will be much harder to do because a tile in one frame isn't directly linked to the one in the next frame. Besides that, defining animation frames is not a simple task and so the GUI will need a lot of work too.

Thus you'd end up with one bank for &quot;taking a step with the left foot&quot; and another for &quot;taking a step with the right foot&quot;.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />[Sorry - more graphics discussion - I should start a different thread for this.]<br /><br />   A couple people are interested in having a look at the sprites for Super Mario Bros, as HDNes ripped them.<br /><br />   Posing 3D models correctly to match the NES sprite sheets of certain games would be interesting. There's plenty of material available - The 3D character models from many video games have been ripped, and other 3D models created by artists. I'm on Mac, so my options are often limited, and I'm not a 3D animator but I do know Poser very well, at least. I did some quick tests last night rigging up Waluigi and Birdo - sort of a mess, but just quick tests anyway.<br /><br />    A lot of videogame models are available for XNALara, aka XNA Posing Studio, and they come fully rigged. I tried out an attempted Mac equivalent called GLLara, but it crashed constantly and was difficult to pose with. Even so, I was able to do a little posing with Ryu Hasabusa (DOA5/Ninja Gaiden), The Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, various Mario characters, and so on.<br /><br />   At times like this it's a pain to be on a Mac, since so much software (especially indie software) doesn't work on it, or work correctly. Oh well.<br /><br />   I've just drawn some new sprites for an NES game - I'll ink and share those when I can.
