I was able to convert FCEUX FM2 movies to Nintendulator's NMV format.. however they're not playing back correctly. <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" alt=":(" title="Sad" /> I made a short video in SMB and it desyncs after some time. The TASVideos.org SMB speedrun failed miserably. I verified that FCEUX and Nintendulator both update controller state at the first scanline of the vblank so that shouldn't be the issue.<br /><br />I think there's a small "bug" in Nintendulator, it doesn't update the controller state for the very first emulated frame. I fixed this and StarTropics speedrun played little bit further than the last time but still desynced eventually.<br /><br />Must be some small detail that's messing it up.<br /><br />EDIT: I have no idea what's going on... my short SMB movie works without fixing that "bug", StarTropics gets much farther with it fixed.<br /><br />EDIT: Fixed! I think. I had to skip TWO of the first frames in the FCEUX movies for it to work right in Nintendulator. It didn't help that Nintendulator seems to exhibit some nondeterministic behaviour when frameskip is enabled...<br /><br />EDIT: Spoke too soon... I haven't gotten any PAL movie working (tho there aren't that many anyways). Some NTSC movies also don't work.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=80">thefox</a> — Wed Apr 06, 2011 9:41 am</p><hr />

So.. I got movie playback working on PowerPak. It doesn't use compression yet so the movies are limited to about 11 minutes on PAL NES, but I'll test it a bit and try work the kinks out before adding that.<br /><br />I modified Nintendulator to output an NMI based controller log to a binary file. Now I just need to convert FCEUX movies to Nintendulator's format or modify FCEUX... or add FCEUX movie playback support in Nintendulator. I have a feeling it might be easiest to just convert FCEUX movies to Nintendulator's format. We'll see...<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=80">thefox</a> — Wed Apr 06, 2011 5:59 am</p><hr />

qbradq, that compression scheme is very clever! Too bad that previous button combinations have to be stored in a separate array, because 128 bytes is a little too much RAM to dedicate to demos in a game.<br /><br />I'm sure this is a great solution for other applications though, the compression ratio is very impressive.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=95">tokumaru</a> — Fri Mar 25, 2011 7:39 pm</p><hr />
