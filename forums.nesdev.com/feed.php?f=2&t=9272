darkhog, I'm more than happy to help you with a specific macro question if you would like, but macros aren't subroutines, though they can call subroutines, it's not the same thing.<br /><br />Writing a macro to do some nametable functions is doable, but, as Shiru says, there are many different things that need to be considered, and such a macro would have to be very generic with lots of options to suit different uses, or very specific to what is needed at the time. <br /><br />If your macro was writing to a vram buffer, for example, you still need to have a separate routine to copy that data to screen when NMI was triggered.<br /><br />Think of a macro as a routine that is called when assembling the code, that outputs 6502 assembly, or other macros until only 6502 assembly is left. The assembler then assembles that code. The macro can not eliminate actually writing the code.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=4680">Movax12</a> — Sun Nov 17, 2013 12:58 am</p><hr />

Well, macros vs subrotines is not 'geez', they are competely different things, related to different entities (specific translator vs CPU). This difference means that you are asking a random guy who is good is in making macros for cc65 in a thread about macros for cc65 to give you some random code, i.e. you are asking to do completely different thing.<br /><br />If you are understand how the NES video hardware workds, you should understand that setting a tile in a nametable is not so straightforward thing. If your nametable is just 1024 bytes in the main RAM, it is one thing. If it is in the VRAM (actual nametable), and the rendering is disabled, it is another. If you need to update tiles when rendering is enabled (your case, as you have mentioned scrolling), this is a whole range of different things: updating sequences of random tiles, updating columns or rows, updating only tiles or attributes, etc, etc, etc. A lot of things should be considered to provide some solution to the task. It can't be as simple as 'please make me a macro', it is a whole topic to be discussed, with certain level of knowledge considered (about the HW, about your specific needs, etc).<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=4205">Shiru</a> — Sat Nov 16, 2013 3:25 pm</p><hr />

To translate a 16-bit number from binary to decimal, you could use <a href="http://wiki.nesdev.com/w/index.php/16-bit_BCD" class="postlink">this subroutine</a> that takes about 700 cycles (6 scanlines) to get the digits, and then you could make another subroutine that runs during vblank and prints the digits to the screen. In my current project, there are four steps: get the digits, convert them to an ASCII string, render the string to tiles, and copy the tiles to the screen.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=9">tepples</a> — Sat Nov 16, 2013 3:07 pm</p><hr />

Could you make some kind of central site with all of your code? Tried to find something on your blog, but it is mixed with disassembly of SMB and whatnot. Also your code formatting makes my eyes hurt (hint: using blue color for background, white for keywords and yellow for code works only in 80x25 terminal that uses DOS font, in 320x240, on anything different it just hurt people's eyes). Anyway, since I'm learning NES assembly now (with ca65), your macro will be useful for me.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=4924">darkhog</a> — Sat Nov 16, 2013 11:26 am</p><hr />

I still harbor fantasies of this becoming more like batari BASIC.
