Put a lot of work into establishing the exact style and layout for the graphics.<br /><br />As for process, I start on custom-designed graph paper, build in Photoshop, import to NES Screen Tool to generate nametables and attribute tables (used to do it by hand using Photoshop actions, this program saves so much of that work) l use yy-chr to manage my CHR files, and use Photoshop actions to build sprite charts that are passed along for coding.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />My brother and I got Mario Paint back when it came out. It was a lot of fun. In the US, Macintoshes and Amigas were not common in homes at the time, so the most complex graphic program I'd used before Mario Paint was Paintbrush on Windows 3.1. Mario Paint mixed in animation and music and had preset stamps for all kinds of Nintendo characters.<br /><br />There's probably not much reason to go back and play it now, but at the time it was great.<br /><br />I'd say there have got to be more copies of Mario Paint that have survived than the mice. You see a copy of Mario Paint thrown in with every lot of cheap games almost. Without the mouse, you pretty much have to give the game away to get rid of it.<br /><br />I just hear point-and-click and a mouse obviously comes to mind. I think it's a cool feature that could work well with a lot of games. More games supporting it would make it more likely that emulator authors would support it which would mean more games supporting it in the future.
