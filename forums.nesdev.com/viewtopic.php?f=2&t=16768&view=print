		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I'm in the process of refactoring my new game to be adjusted for the currently detected TV system. My approach is to simply store a global value saying whether the clock speed is NTSC or PAL/Dendy. Then, velocities, accelerations, frame counter speeds, etc. are all retrieved from small lookup tables containing the correct values for each clock speed.<br /><br />It's turning out quite nicely, but I realized that it starts to get not so accurate for fine grained timings such as animations, which typically have a frame-by-frame counter.<br /><br />What I'm curious about is if anybody goes quite so crazy as to have sub-frame animation speed, much like one would implement tempo in a music engine?<br /><br />I'm guessing not...that sounds too problematic to me, just as sub-frame speed adjustment for envelopes would create audible sound artifacts...

Sounds like on PAL/Dendy animations might suddenly jump to the next frame or if you've got other precise timings in place that match up state machine transitions with animations...I think I'm gonna stick with the lut approach.

Using approximate values is enough for me. For instance, if I have something that is supposed to change an animation frame every 9 frames, using 7 on PAL/Dendy looks close enough. (9 * .83333 ~ 7.49) Undoubtedly the subtle differences between platforms could compound for the whole game and make certain things easier or harder for the player depending. I find that easier to accept than the whole game looking/playing like molasses. Haha (i.e. doing nothing about region differences and letting it just be slow on PAL, as I did in my first game. Second game, I adjusted only for PAL for the music and raster effects, the gameplay was still NTSC timed)

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Yeah, sorry, let me spell that out more explicitly:<br /><br />The least common multiple of 50 and 60 Hz is 300Hz. If you had one animation that ran at 300 Hz, you could advance through this table at 5 steps per vertical refresh when rendering for 60Hz output, and advance at 6 steps per vertical refresh when rendering for 50Hz output. If the animation involves physics (gravity) simulation, you may need to actually evaluate the intermediate steps.<br /><br />The greatest common factor of 50 and 60 Hz is 10Hz. You could redraw the same thing for 5 refreshes on PAL, and for 6 refreshes on NTSC, and it'd be the same. Or, because 12 and 12.5fps is rather close, you could instead just accept the 4% difference and draw the same thing for 4 refreshes on PAL and 5 on NTSC.

Can you elaborate? I've never spotted any significant color differences when testing for NTSC or PAL on the emulators I'm using (FCEUX, Nestopia, Nintendulator) which would make me imagine red and green were swapped (unless I misunderstood).<br /><br />Maybe it's not worth the hassle, I dunno. It just feels ultra professional to get as close as I possibly can to working close to the same on most any NES, within reason. Like, I've encountered a couple of gnarly timing situations which are probably not worth adjusting between the systems, but a lot of things can be adjusted without too much headache honestly.

I've seen crazier approaches suggested above, but I'm curious if anybody has actually done it in an actually released homebrew.
