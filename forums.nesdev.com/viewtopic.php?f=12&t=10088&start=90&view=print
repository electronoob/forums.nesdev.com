These boards are excellent and I will be getting more in the future!<br /><br />First, a pretty basic question....Does it matter if a rom is padded or doubled?  I padded a 1.5MB file to 4MB yesterday and noticed no issues.  Will the padding cause an issue later in the game or did I just get lucky?<br />If I do a doubled rom do I just use a basic joining program to put them together or is there a better way?<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">Captain N wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">Also does the Star Ocean 96Mbit no sdd-1 rom work on your boards? I could not get it to work.<br />I know the rom is good since it works on my SNES POWERPACK. I can get it to flash fully with out any errors and but it black screens. On my super wild card DX 2 it reads the rom internal data atleast.<br />i did remove the header and corrected the checksums. but still no go.<br />Is there a special way i have to split/combin the rom?<br /></div><br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">infiniteneslives wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">Yeah that game's format is typically interleaved, my current firmware release only works for de-interleaved roms.  I should have my deinterleaving firmware out soon now that I found the bug plaguing my NES flashing code.  Shoot me an email and I'll help you get those issues resolved. <!-- e --><a href="mailto:paul@infiniteneslives.com">paul@infiniteneslives.com</a><!-- e --></div><br /><br />I was wondering if this had been figured out yet.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />For any ROM that is 4, 8, or 16 megabits, you should copy/duplicate the ROM data until it fills up the flash chip. Some games will function without doing this, but many will not.<br /><br />Roms that are uneven sizes like 10, 12, 20, and 24 megabits may be a bit more complicated. There are also instructions somewhere for how to handle the 48mbit Tales of Phantasia and the 96mbit Star Ocean I think. <br /><br />I think it's possible in some cases two games that are the same different size might expect different mirroring behavior as one might be using two ROM chips rather than one.

I tried to get some information on how to use the TENNIS JCIC properly, but i could not find any (might just be, that i can not set the region corresponding to my SNES).<br /><br />Secondly, I can not play games that use more than 1MB (8MBit) of memory. I tried Super Mario World, it works flawlessly, even unpadded (just flashing the 512kb file). I also tried just for testing Axelay, which also worked without problems, same as before it also worked unpadded.<br />But if I try to flash Tales of symphonia, the way like mentioned some pages before with doubling last 2MB of the game and putting the first 4MB of the rom after the 2x2MB, it does not work. I thought it might be because of the uneven size which needs some trickery padding of the rom to fill the 12MB, but I had not luck with any game of a size from 2MB up to 12MB (like donkey kong country 2 or secret of mana which have even rom sizes, they also did not work padded to 12MB) <img src="./images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" alt=":(" title="Sad" /><br /><br />I would really appreciate help of you guys and i hope to get to play tales of symphonia on real hardware <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />If it helps, i have a super nintendo cart backup tool, which allows me to dump cartridges up to a size of 4MB (32mbit), might be helpful to analyze what is wrong.

Try copying the first 4MB of the 8MB ROM onto the back, that might work. If not then try copying the last half onto the back. I'd guess one of those might work.

It's supposed to region switch on reset.  I think there's a variation in SNES PAL CIC's out there that's causing an issue for some people.  I added support for the superCIC to my second revision of the boards which showed up last week.  I'd be happy to swap it out with the new revision for you.

Someone has offered to help me with a new version of the host app to help resolve these issues.  The main problem is there is no mirroring on a 12MB board, every rom address has a unique byte.  So Hirom games need to be programmed into lorom space as well in an interleaved fashion to get things to work.  Mottzilla's suggestion should help if you have a 8MB board.  I'm expecting a beta release that I'll post here in the next week or so.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">I would really appreciate help of you guys and i hope to get to play tales of symphonia on real hardware <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /></div>I don't know anything about that game.

You can call me Skylar or Danin, doesn't much matter which. I've been hammering away at this app for just short of two weeks now, and I think progress has been pretty decent. I've rewritten it from scratch, using up-to-date libUSB libs, and crammed as many features as I can think of into it. INL or myself will be making a proper release thread for my new host app, and I'll be your friendly neighborhood dev. I'm not a pro, so there will be bugs. I'll come back here and edit in a URL for the new host app once it's posted.

Specific things about my board here.<br /><br />On that note, I got the next revision of my boards in last week.  Not too many changes though:<br />*added support for ikari's superCIC as things weren't working for all those guys in PAL land.  Need to get a PAL SNES for testing to help out Jim's Cool.<br />*added a jumper to support halving the SRAM. This will ground A11, the CPLD can be configured to limit SRAM to 4KByte (32Kbit), with that this jumper will trim down to 2KByte (16Kbits) as some games require.<br />*added placement for a low pass RC filter on the back of the board for the reset signal for better multicart switching.<br />*they turned out a little more orange than yellow for this batch... oh well.
