The UltraHDMI is yet another mod I certainly know that I can't do myself anyway, but I do want to commission someone to install it for me someday. Although I'm not no where near as big a fan of the N64 as I am with the 8-bit and 16-bit consoles so I can definitely wait it out.

If so, your NES and PowerPak are OK, but you're seeing an artifact of the NES's video memory limit.<br /><br />The NES PPU's background map is 2 screens wide by 2 screens high. But there's only enough video memory in the Control Deck to configure it as 1 screen wide by 2 screens high (&quot;vertical arrangement&quot;) or 2 screens wide by 1 screen high (&quot;horizontal arrangement&quot;). The map is <a href="https://wiki.nesdev.com/w/index.php/Mirroring#Nametable_Mirroring" class="postlink">mirrored</a>, or duplicated, into the missing space: a vertical arrangement (1x2) is mirrored horizontally, and a horizontal arrangement (2x1) is mirrored vertically. The cartridge chooses which of these two applies. On a simpler cartridge, a blob of solder on the H or V pad chooses horizontal or vertical arrangement. More sophisticated cartridges can rearrange the map at runtime; this is why <em>Metroid</em> scrolls in four directions without any visible problems.<br /><br />You may be familiar with the discolored tiles at the right side of <em>Super Mario Bros. 3</em>. This is because the game scrolls horizontally on a cartridge configured for vertical arrangement. (It does this because the game also scrolls vertically and diagonally.) Likewise, if you try to scroll vertically on a cartridge configured for horizontal arrangement, a line of text or graphics will be momentarily split between the top and bottom of the screen. Most NTSC TVs have at least 8 pixels of overscan on top and bottom, which largely hides this artifact. But yours has none, causing the artifact to be visible. In <em>Concentration Room</em> and <em>Haunted: Halloween '85</em>, I tried to accommodate zero-overscan displays by blanking the line that would be split. This is important for the PAL NES, which has 1 line of overscan at the top and none at the bottom.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I'm sitting here with a gutted/disassembled NES ready for a Hi-Def kit to be put in, and I was thinking about the palette file switching this kit is capable of. Would it be possible to assign a color other than black for the colors that are on the far right of the palette? I'm referring to palettes $0D, $1D, $0E, $1E, $2E, $3E, $0F, $1F, $2F, and $3F. I want to expand the NES palette and would love some extra colors to work with. I've supplied emulators with custom palette files before and hacked ROMs to address those palettes and they worked fine. I'm hoping I would be able to do the same thing here. Thoughts?<br /><br />Edit: From the wiki:<br /><img src="https://wiki.nesdev.com/w/images/5/59/Savtool-swatches.png" alt="Image" /><br />I'm referring to the black ones to the right. I realize many games use $0F for black, so I'll keep it that way. I'll probably hijack $0D instead. My question is now, though, how is the data packaged in the .nes update ROM? How do I go about finding the palettes in the package, and is it safe to edit them?

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I'm an owner of an AV Famicom, and I'm in love with the idea of modding it to install the Hi-Def NES. The only thing is breaking my heart is the sole idea of cutting the console's shell to make a way for the HDMI port. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_cry.gif" alt=":cry:" title="Crying or Very sad" /><br /><br />I hope it could have a way to put the Hi-Def NES board in a position to make the HDMI port completely positioned in the same direction of the rear panel without harm the console's internal structure. With this, could be awesomely beautiful to use a custom 3D printed rear panel, like the one Kevtris put in a AV Famicom in <strong><a href="https://youtu.be/URdKMF-6-4k" class="postlink">THIS VIDEO</a></strong>.<br /><br />Sadly, it's not possible to install both Hi-Def NES and NESRGB at the same time. It would be perfect to use the same console in a CRT and in modern TVs, achieving the game's max visual quality in both cases.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I dug a bit into the issue that teknix1 &amp; bird333 have brought up about the wavy lines at the top of the screen. Using a capture card and stepping through frames, I can see the pattern is very consistent; the top three* game rows are offset exactly 1 game pixel to the left every other frame. I tested the following games on real carts (where applicable), and they all showed the same behavior.<br /><br />240p test suite (PowerPak)<br />The Legend of Zelda (need to clip Link into the HUD)<br />Mega Man 6<br />The Simpsons: Bart vs. the Space Mutants<br />Tetris<br /><br />Conceptually, this should be easy to correct for if the behavior lines up with the PPU even/odd flag although I don't know if the missing pixels are recoverable. (Caveat: I don't program FPGAs or know much about the NES.) It would be nice if this was addressed.<br /><br />*The viewport also seems to be shifted down by one game pixel. In other words, the top row has a black line inserted, the next three rows are jittery, and the bottom row is missing except in 1080p 4x mode. It's nice that the bottom row is visible in that mode since it suggests the other modes can be fixed.
