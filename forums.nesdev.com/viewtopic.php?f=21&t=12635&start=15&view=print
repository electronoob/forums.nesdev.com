We're talking about rereleasing games here, which Steam games haven't been. Just forget what I said earlier so this topic doesn't get derailed too badly.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />It's true that there are many SMB game releases and SMB clones. However, not much is SMB3 or SMASB3 or even the awesome SMA4B3 where you can fly and be a bear with a raccoon tail and throw blocks at enemies.<br />The point of my project is to learn how to make a Mario engine (which means tile-based collisions, entity collision, game physics for all entities), enjoy the retro style of it (some retro taste in graphics, some cool tail-wagging fire-spitting brick-smashing block-punching pipe-oink-oink-oinking action with my name on it and effort in it), but with different graphics and other tangible expressions.<br /><br />Some significant things I want to do is that the enemies aren't just stupid &quot;Goombas&quot;, but when they see the player, they run towards him like Goombas do in the new topview Mario game for Wii U (I don't know how it's called). Tailwagging a shell can cause the shell to stomp a &quot;Goomba&quot;. A &quot;Goomba&quot; can kick a shell by accident. &quot;Mario&quot; can switch weapons and superpowers during the action scene. Using only 2KB of RAM for the game's active objects and game state, ROM for levels and WRAM for saving the game. The player shape and colors will be customizable; yes, I like character generators. Probably I'll make a level editor too just like Battle City has one. I have experience of these things in game development from the past years in the Multimedia Fusion series and Game Maker series, but the programs were limited and it was impossible to implement that stuff and it also caused me to learn wrong stuff about programming. Now it's the time for me to do this in the most optimized way possible.
