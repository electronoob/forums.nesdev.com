A huge ASM file is pretty annoying to maintain. I got to the point where I have each routine and each table (or set of related tables) in its own file, while the main file is just a bunch of includes. This way I can easily reorder things in the ROM when I need to.<br /><br />I would keep file extensions consistent though... If a file contains ASM code, it makes much more sense so give it the .asm extension than .txt, but ultimately, not even the main file has to be .asm, you're free to use whatever you want.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=95">tokumaru</a> — Mon Oct 13, 2014 2:49 pm</p><hr />

Yes, you're free to include other files with code in them. Extension doesn't matter to NESASM except to find the file with that exact name. Keeping .asm or .somethingconsistent might be worth it if you are using a text editor with syntax highlighting, though.<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">   .include &quot;othercode.txt&quot;</div><br />is fine. All labels will be read etc, it basically treats it as if everything in &quot;othercode.txt&quot; was placed where the .include line for &quot;othercode.txt&quot; is in the other file.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3504">Kasumi</a> — Mon Oct 13, 2014 5:49 am</p><hr />

I was actually surprised how easily I got the background to change when I press a button. By the way, if I include other text files (do they too need to be in .asm or is .txt fine?) that have the background tables, does NESASM3 recognize labels outside the main .asm file when the program is compiled? It would help to keep the program itself clean if I could put the background tables somewhere else than the main .asm file.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=6724">Tsutarja</a> — Mon Oct 13, 2014 2:48 am</p><hr />

Unrelatedly, I strongly recommend using variables instead of immediate addresses for things in RAM. (i.e. add &quot;NMIcount .rs 1&quot; right after &quot;.rsset&quot; and don't use &quot; $1E&quot;)<br /><br />Here's the loop that vegaplay uses to upload a nametable:<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">NameLoop:                       ; loop to draw entire nametable<br />        LDA (pointerLo),y<br />        STA $2007<br />        INY<br />        BNE NameLoop<br />        INC pointerHi<br />        DEX<br />        BNE NameLoop</div><p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3512">lidnariq</a> — Sun Oct 12, 2014 11:44 am</p><hr />

So, I have been trying to get the background update loop in my NMI to work for like a month now. I have no problem loading a partial background of 256 tiles, but once it goes past that, I just can't get it to work. Either my program gets stuck in the loop or draws the background incorrectly. I know I need 16 bit math for this, but I just can't program a 16 bit stuff on 8 bit processor.<br /><br />The way I'm updating my background is that the program sets the high and low bytes of the target background's location in pointers and sets a &quot;flag&quot; that the NMI checks if it's set. If it is, the NMI will update the background from the location that is stored to the pointers. Then the NMI clears the flag and ends the NMI. If the flag is not set the NMI will draw the updated background.<br /><br />Here is my code if you need to take a look at it: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://pastebin.com/HbvTbPDM">http://pastebin.com/HbvTbPDM</a><!-- m --><p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=6724">Tsutarja</a> — Sun Oct 12, 2014 11:27 am</p><hr />
