Tepples I listened to your .ogg and this isn't the melody. The melody is what Rick Astley is singing, the rest is part of chords.<br /><br />As I already said the chords DOES match well for the most parts, but it's the ONLY thing that matches. The bassline is quite different, increase the bass of your amplifier if you can't hear it. Robo's bass is a simple rythm following the chords while NGGYU's bass is quite complex.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=38">Bregalad</a> — Tue Apr 05, 2011 11:01 am</p><hr />

OK so to proof that Robo's theme is not similar with NGGYU, I took the time to analyse MIDIs from both songs and compare their sequences chords for the chorus (I didn't do it for the verses because they are obviously very different and don't blend together well at all).<br /><br />The chord sequence for NGGYU is :<br />Gb7, Ab, Ab, Bbm<br />Gb7, Ab, Ab, Bbm<br />Gb7, Ab, Ab, Bbm<br />Gb7, Ab, Ab, Bbm<br /><br />The chord sequence for Robo is :<br />G, A, A, Bm7<br />G, A, A, D<br />G, A, A, Bm7<br />G, A, A, B<br /><br />First constat is that NGGYU is a semitone lower, so they had to transpose either song to blend them together. Here for the example I'll transpose NGGYU one semitone higher, which gives :<br />G7, A, A, Bm<br /><br />Which is similar to Robo's chord sequence for lines 1 and 3, just that the 7th is placed at the first chord instead at the last BUT you'll note that the last chord is different for lines 2 and 3.<br /><br />Also the melody is very different, there is no way you could call it similar. And please stop talking about lawyers and juges when there is no ROM download implied (it's not like if Rick Astley is going to sue Square).<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=38">Bregalad</a> — Mon Apr 04, 2011 11:57 am</p><hr />
