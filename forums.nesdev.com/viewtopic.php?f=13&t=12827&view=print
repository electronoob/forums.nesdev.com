I tried sending myself a PM, but it probably won't work because it also didn't appear as an unread message (that made me lol a little).<br /><br />edit: I can confirm that I was PM'd after posting that, and didn't receive an email.

When I signed into the account it gave me a &quot;suspicious activity&quot; warning and had me verify my phone #.  Hopefully it'll get better now that I've verified that, but that remains to be seen.  If this ends up not working, I can try moving it to a membler-industries.com email account.<br /><br />If it still continues to not work as expected, let me know.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">Do the notifications come from the same e-mail address as before (info at nesdev dot com)?
