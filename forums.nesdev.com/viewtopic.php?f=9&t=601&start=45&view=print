<br />
<br />If someone can track for us the path that the video signal take in the top loader between the PPU and the RF Box like I did for the NFC. That would be helpfull for fidding the real probleme.

The only reason to use RF is that it is likely to involve less drastic alterations to the top-loader's PCB.  (No need to cut the video line to the RF unit or solder directly to the PPU pin.)

The best possible way to generate S-video without swapping out the PPU would involve tracking the master and pixel clocks somehow, determining the high and low voltages for a given pixel, sending the average on the luma pair, and sending the difference on the chroma pair.

<br />
<br />If I get my facts straight...
<br />1) It seems that the well documented A/V Mod isn't sufficient to clean up the video.
<br />2) You can use some component from a toaster style NES to fix the video, and also have A/V out, but it wont fit in the top loader box.
<br />
<br />I might be OK with 2, but I'm wondering if anyone can put up some pics of what piece to "lift" from the old NES and how to use to put out a clean video signal.
<br />
<br />Thanks for the help!

<br />
<br />It appears the reason for the 'lines' on the toploader's video is the PPU.  It is a revision H PPU, which is only found in the toploaders.  The front loaders all use revision G PPUs.  
<br />
<br />So, you could try swapping out the PPU from a front loader to see if it fixes the problem.  I suspect it will.
<br />
<br />I want to do this mod to my toploader, but I just have never gotten around to doing it.

I drew up the video sections of each, from the ppu pin to the rf box pin.  They are very similar, with the top loader adding just 2 resistors.  Unforunately there is no info about the insides of the rf box.  <a href="http://www.nesmuseum.com/images/nesvideo.png" class="postlink">Link to video schematics</a>

		<td><b>Here's a way to fix the top-loading NES's video</b></td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I don't know if anyone has a better way of fixing the vertical line distortion in the top-loading NES, but I recently recuced it in mine by about 90-95%.  My method, unfortunately, does require making a couple of cuts on the board, which I dreaded doing, but it was necessary for the mod.  The problem is that the video signal coming out of the PPU is getting interference from the address/data lines, mainly AD7, since the pathways are so close together.  Here's how to fix it:
<br />
<br />1) Find the pathway on the top side of the board connecting pin 21 of the PPU to Q1. 
<br />2) VERY CAREFULLY, cut this pathway as close to the PPU pin 21 as possible.  BE VERY CAREFUL NOT TO CUT THE ADJACENT PATHWAYS!  Use an ohm-meter to make sure it's cut all the way through.
<br />3) Now cut it as close to Q1 as possible.  This is important!  If you don't cut it at both ends, it will act like an antenna and thus not eliminating the interference.  Make sure it's completely cut.
<br />4) Look on the bottom of the board and find Q1.  There's a pathway coming off of the front pin of Q1 leading to a test point near the power switch.
<br />5) Connect a wire from PPU pin 21 to this test point.  I recommend running the wire in an "S" fashion, coming off pin 21 at an angle following the diagonal +5V pathway there, then come around along the small ground plane going through the middle pin of Q2, then back along the next +5V pathway up to the test point.
<br />
<br />If you did this correctly, you should now have a nice clear picture.

		<td><b>A simpler AV mod</b></td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Oh, yeah.  I figured I'd mention this while I'm at it.  Many people believe that adding AV jacks to the top-loading NES requires an additional transistor for the cideo signal.  This is not true; Q1, when properly wired, can amplify the video signal sufficiently.  I discovered this in my AV Famicom, which uses this transistor as the only source of video amplification.  I removed the modulator in my top-loading NES and used a circuit similar to the AV Famicom, except that I substituted the resistors for other values, mainly due to availability.  My circuit produces a picture that's just a little bit darker than the AV Famicom's, but I think the colors are better.  Here's what to do:
<br />
<br />1) Replace R1 (510 ohm) with either a 390 ohm resistor (what I used) or a 310 ohm resistor (what's in the AV Famicom).
<br />2) Remove R3 (150 ohm).
<br />3) Replace R2 with an axial 220uF capacitor, at least 6V (if it's too long to fit in the R2 slot, connect the back lead to the front hole for R3).  MAKE SURE that the (-) end is at the FRONT and the + end is at the BACK.
<br />4) Desolder the right side of the filter choke FC2 (between the cartridge connector and the heat sink) and pull it up.
<br />5) Install one lead of either a 120 ohm resistor (what I used) or a 110 ohm resistor (what's in the AV Famicom) into the right hole where you pulled out FC2.  Connect the other end of the resistor in series with the filter choke.
<br />
<br />You can now connect the left hole where the modulator once was to a video jack.  If you intend to leave in the modulator, you'll need to use a resistor with a larger value at the filter choke (I don't know exactly what value to use in this case - you'll need to try different ones to see what gives you the best RF image).  Then you can tap a wire off of the choke/resistor junction and feed the wire into a 390 or 310 ohm resistor on your video jack.  You'll need to refer to other sources for audio connection, though.  I just tap 1uF capacitors off of pins 1 &amp; 2 of the CPU, but you may not find the volume to be sufficient by doing that.
