How was I dissing Apple? I've had a love/hate relationship with Apple computers over a decade/over half my life. I have no idea why you felt the need to make a CPU list, are you implying Apple are CPU trendsetters for consoles? That might be the case or it might be coincidence, it's totally irrelevant. Not related but when Apple finally makes the switch to IA64 what will that mean to you? heh<br /><br />I suggested the PCI-X card because I really do think someone should develop a parallel port compatible with modern computers (including Apples), it'd be one more push for me towards getting a G5 should uCON64 support that parallel port.<br /><br />PCI parallel ports can be easily had for less than $20 shipped. I don't know what aspect makes one quality, all PCI cards I've seen are EPP compliant, it either works or it doesn't. If someone has a PC without integrated parallel port or a free PCI slot, they may want to reconsider their PC if they intend to interact with legacy hardware. <br /><br />I'm personally adamant about parallel ports because I use the parallel port to communicate with dozens of backup devices and with 5 or 6 other devices which I cannot afford overpriced USB counterparts of such as my JTAG cables.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=20">kyuusaku</a> — Tue Nov 29, 2005 6:48 pm</p><hr />

The reason the parallel port is used is because it's really easy to program it.  USB isn't excessively difficult, but it certainly takes some study time.  Also, dealing with the PP is very low level - write to a port and flip an io pin.  USB is abstracted away pretty far by the OS, so you need to deal with some higher level abstractions (endpoints, interfaces, devices etc.).  Lots of low level programmers/hardware people just don't want to spend the time to learn that stuff because it's not very interesting to them.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=29">teaguecl</a> — Sun Nov 27, 2005 10:44 pm</p><hr />

For USB, doing device-&gt;computer is very easy if you can use the built in HID drivers (mice, keyboards, etc).  If you want to transfer data or do computer-&gt;device you need to write your own operating system specific drivers which is far harder than interfacing with the parallel port.  It used to be very easy to program the serial and parallel ports, Windows just makes it harder for no reason. <br /><br />My off topic problem with the CopyNES right now is that my keyboard stops working when a program is run in a dos window!<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=228">bunnyboy</a> — Sun Nov 27, 2005 10:42 pm</p><hr />

Is there some particular reason these devices continue to use parallel ports instead of, say, USB?  USB interface ICs are ridiculously inexpensive (or so a college EE friend of mine tells me).<br /><br />I'm just wondering, since a lot of hardware engineering folk -- even in 2005 -- still swear by the parallel port (which is being phased out, as we can see from the removal of legacy devices on some present-day motherboards).<br /><br />Just curious.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3">koitsu</a> — Sun Nov 27, 2005 8:02 pm</p><hr />

I've confirmed that the free and open source PC hardware emulator, QEMU, which can be used to run DOS, FreeDOS, Windows 98, and Linux on either Linux or Windows XP, in fact does support the PC parallel port.  AFAIK, parallel port support is only available under Linux,  Linux people have been using it for parallel-JTAG software that is Windows only.  I have an old copy of Windows 98 SE floating around my house somewhere.  I am going to try my GBX first.<br /><br />Windows XP users might want to check out QEMU to see if they can parallel support working.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=94">Jagasian</a> — Thu Nov 24, 2005 7:05 am</p><hr />

On a related note, I've run into the exact same issues with my prototype dumper (CopyCart).  I've gone with a USB interface which hopefully still will have a lot of life in it, certainly more than parallel or serial ports.  Also, I've written the PC side of the dumping software in Python.  That way, it's 100% portable between linux and windows (and probably a lot more).  Python is slow, but performance isn't an issue.<br />So what I'm saying is, it would be nice to have someone make an implementation in Java/Python or some other platform independent language.  If I had a CopyNES I would volunteer, but my dumper is taking up all my time right now.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=29">teaguecl</a> — Wed Nov 23, 2005 2:01 pm</p><hr />

What I would suggest doing if you have XP is to simply make a DOS 6.22 bootdisk and perhaps a small FAT partition.  (My two 250GB RAID 0 drives are formatted for NTFS, but there is 16MB of unformatted space which would be perfect when combined with a CD of NES ROMs.)  Whenever you needed to use CopyNES, simply use a bootdisk.  Not the most convenient solution, but it will have to do for us advanced folks until someone writes an app that will support parallel ports in Win XP.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=58">Great Hierophant</a> — Thu Nov 10, 2005 11:02 am</p><hr />
