		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Since 2005, I've been at work translating and expanding the NSF Ripper Guide originally written by Izumi. Finally I've received some inspiration and decided to update it, I'm nearing to finishing the doc at last.
<br />
<br />As far as the translation part of the document is concerned, the document still retains the original flavor and intent  but has been greatly changed. Some things have been directly translated, most of it has been expanded and re-written to include new methods of ripping that is based on my methods and opinions. 
<br />
<br />In the beginning, when I was ripping NSF's, I learned a lot from the original document. As I was translating and exapanding the document I was sometimes learning as I was going along. I have received a few comments along the way, both privately and publicly that the document has helped them learn how to rip NSFs. That indeed was one of the main point of helping people learning how to rip NSFs. At the time that I started ripping NSF's, I don't recall anyone that was ripping NSFs. It was a great and happy occassion when Kingshriek, UGETAB and many others joined the NSF rip request thread where many great NSF's were ripped.
<br />
<br />And now, nearly the beginning of 2008, I'm finally nearing completion of this document. I hope that more people continue to learn something from it and once I am done, I will be greatly releived because it's been a heck of a lot of work to do so.
<br />
<br />Those that read the updated sections and find anything that is not accurate or the grammar is so bad to the point that it detracts from understanding what was written, I would appreciate and respect any constructive criticism. Even though I have put forth some effort to provide decent grammar and spelling, I really don't want to spend too much time cleaning up typos. Thanks in advance. 
<br />
<br />I hope that you enjoy reading the updated sections. I'm planning on writing more to attempt to finish this document once and for all.
