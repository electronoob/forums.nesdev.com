So there is 1 MiB somewhere that is not included in the .nes rom? It is a limitation of Kazzo scripts? Sorry for my ignorance!

I only have 16 KiB of the contents of the UVEPROM, and unlike the existing dumps of MK008/MK009, it's weirdly aligned (i.e. the 16 KiB I see, despite coming from a region where A14 is high, correspond to a previous dump in a ROM where A14 is low), so I don't actually have any guess what's in the half that I haven't received.<br /><br />BUT: I wouldn't be surprised if it turns out that the 27C256 actually contains two copies of the same 16 KiB of source data.

Any connections should only be to the power supply pins (14 and 28).<br /><br />I mean, I only have the bad dump, but given that the first 2 MiB of the dump you have now <strong>works</strong> and the bad dump you sent me <strong>doesn't</strong>, I have to assume that whatever you have right now is a good dump of the 27C256 also.
