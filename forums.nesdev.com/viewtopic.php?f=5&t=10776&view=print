		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Due to my recent &quot;Castlevania&quot; experience, I wanted to start a thread to collect game-breaking glitches in NES games: Which glitches do you know of that make a game unplayable once the glitch was triggered?<br /><br />It needs to be a glitch that isn't easily avoidable. Things like &quot;If you attack the boss three times with your secondary weapon and the game freezes&quot; don't count. Just don't attack him with your secondary weapon. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt=":mrgreen:" title="Mr. Green" /> If you know about the glitch here, you can easily avoid it.<br /><br />I'm talking about the ones that you have no real influence on. Like the glitch in &quot;Castlevania&quot;, PRG0 revision: If there are too many sprites on the screen or whatever, the game writes corrupt data into the RAM and the game freezes. This tends to happen on the last floor right before the Grim Reaper. Since this has nothing to do with your own actions, but with enemy appearance, there's nothing you can really do about it, unless you're an expert player who can destroy every enemy on sight.<br /><br />So, what other game-breaking glitches are there?

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Sometimes the rat disappears in the rat race of Battletoads. If you make it to the bomb, you can't progress because the rat won't die, and there's no way for you to die so your game is stuck. This is a good reason for arcade games and other games to have kill timers, the ensured death gives a way for the game to recover.

It was either in Nintendulator or FCEUXD, and I believe it was when I was going through a door (so the screen wasn't scrolling). I assume it wasn't related to emulator inaccuracy (though I could certainly be wrong), but it rules out the typical game crash you get on a real NES. I figure it's some sort of bug.
