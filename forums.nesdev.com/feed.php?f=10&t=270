Doing a search and replace might be faster.  Like if you know the program always uses STA $8000,X you could search for $9D,$00,$80 in the rom.  But since games can write to many places for the same register, that probably won't always work.<br /><br />I used a thing like this for playing NSF files a while back.  I replaced all the sound register writes with JSRs so I could save a copy of the register data to RAM so it can displayed.<br /><br />If a program uses indirect writes for this, that could make things much harder to find.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=10">Memblers</a> — Thu Jun 16, 2005 12:07 am</p><hr />

If you want to put 20 games that are 20x128kb of PRG and 20x128 kb of CHR (for example), you can forget about using an MMC3 to banksitch them (not enought space, the maximum PRG ammount is 512kb and 256kb for the CHR as far I know.<br />If you want to put 20 NROM games (for example 12x32 kb of PRG + 8x16kb of PRG, assuming that you imput 12 40kb NROM games and 8 24kb NROM games) it'll do 512kb of PRG, and 160kb of CHR, so you can imput all this stuff on a MMC3 card, programm your own menu, then when a game is selected you can banksitch the corresponding CHR page in, setup your vectors and do it.<br />Otherwise, you'll have to hack the games to use your own mapper with your own logic, and you can do your own board with all this stuff on it. That would be really hard (if possible) to do with MMC3 using games, but possible with discret logic games. You'll also have to make a lockout-chip defather or to solver one from a real card.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=38">Bregalad</a> — Wed Jun 15, 2005 11:37 am</p><hr />

Yes, horizontal mirroring is 1, but I wanna to show something using vertical mirroring here.<br />Yes, I mess up, and I've set all unused bits, doing $fe instead of $1e ($1f will be the same with horizontal mirroring). I think this would "reset" the reg 0 again at the first write, and so the segond write will be the first, etc.... so the reg 0 would wait for a fiveth write again and again.... but set all unused bit exept bit 7 is no problem.<br />Did you understand or about bus conflicts ? This is not important when you're testing some of your code in emulation only, but this is VERY important on the real hardware. Writing to any adress $8000-$ffff will write to the mapper (D pins of the 74HC161 chips), but, the PRG rom chip is still enabled ( /OE enable pin is usually tied to GND, this means that the outpout is enabled), so if the walue at the adress you're writing is not exactly the same as the one who is stored in the ROM chip, bus conflicts will appears. This appends on the whole 8 bit data, not only to the pins used by the mapper. If the one outpout pin of the CPU is 0 (0v) and the output pin of the EPROM is 1 (+5v), a short would appear. Fortunataly, I think both chips are well protected agains this stuff, and this won't destroy the CPU or your ROM. But the voltage value at the 74HC161 is non determinated, and could be considerated as well as a low or a high voltage level. Anyway, this is very bad and you have to take care of this, just by writing to an array like Memblers said.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=38">Bregalad</a> — Thu Apr 07, 2005 10:14 am</p><hr />

You're using the NESAsm assembler, right?  I'm not sure how to include the extra CHR banks in there.  But you could always copy the extra ones on after assembly, with a command like "copy /b file.nes+file1.chr+file2.chr+file3.chr game.nes"<br /><br />Also, when you use mapper 3 (and some of the other simple mappers) on a cart, you have to use special way to write to ROM because of bus conflicts.  The value you write has to be in ROM.<br /><br />Here's the clearest way to do it:<br /><br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">banktable: .byte 0,1,2,3<br /><br /> lda #2 ; bank to select<br /> tax<br /> sta banktable,x<br /></div><br /><br />And a quicker way:<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">banktemp:<br /> lda #2<br /> sta banktemp+1<br /></div><p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=10">Memblers</a> — Wed Apr 06, 2005 7:55 pm</p><hr />

Be carfull, many MMC1 docs are obsolete, and there is stupid mistakes like backward mirroring. Yes, vertical mirroring is 0 and horizontal mirroring is 1, not the opposite.<br />Well, if you have trouble about controlling a mapper, don't begin with the MMC1. Writing to all mappers but MMC1 is easy.<br />Imagine you're using a simple CNROM board (mapper 3). You have only one register that switches a 8kb CHR-ROM page. Writing at any adress between $8000 and $ffff will write to the mapper and switch the page you want to, normally CNROM uses only 2 bits, so you can have 4 different 8kb CHRROM page (into one 32kb CHRROM chip). Just write the number of the CHR page you want to the mapper (0, 1, 2 or 3), that's it (in pratice you also have to worry about bus conflicts, but I won't go into details now).<br /><br />Now let's process to the next level. You're using a UNROM board (mapper 2). You also have only one register, that expand PRGROM instead of CHRROM, and is 3 bit or 4 bit wide (depending of UNROM or UOROM boads). This allow you to swap a 16kb rom bank page at $8000-$bfff, but all the data at $c000-$ffff will remain always the same (the last 16kb page) because of the 74HC32 chip. This allow you to use 8 or 16 bank of 16kb to have a 128kb or 256kb PRGROM chip. Writing to the mapper works as simple as CNROM, write anything to $8000-$ffff will set one of your 8 (or 16) PRGROM banks.<br /><br />Now let's process to the third level, the MMC1. It has 4 different registers, one for mirroring and bankswitching control, two for the CHRROM banking value and one for the PRGROM switching value.<br />Those are no usual registers, but boolean register so only the LSB is written to the mapper. Set the MSB if you want to "reset" the register (you have to always do it at CPU reset), regardless of the value of the register.<br />When you write to the MMC1, it does 5 internal "temporary" switches to get the value in any register, and when you set up the 5th value the register is uploaded.<br />The usual way to upload a register is like this. Typically you have a simple banksitching like UNROM does on the MMC1, so you have one 16kb bank switched at $8000-$bfff and a hardwired bank at $c000-$ffff and have vertical mirroring. Let's say you're using two 4kb ChrRom switch.<br />So, regardeless of 1 bit switching, you have to write $1e into reg 0 (%0001'1110 = $1e). The code is :<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">lda #$80  ;Reset reg 0<br />sta $8000 ;This is needed only one at reset<br />lda #$fe<br />sta $8000 ;Write all 5 bits to the mappers<br />lsr A<br />sta $8000<br />lsr A<br />sta $8000<br />lsr A<br />sta $8000<br />lsr A<br />sta $8000 ;Reg 0 is uploaded NOW<br />rts</div><br />All MMC1 regs works the same, so you also have to swith your data 5 times in CHR ROM bank and PRG ROM bank registers, even if you don't use all the bits for your bankswitching. Typically, you have a 128kb PRG rom switch, so only 4 bits of reg 3 are used. Remember that bit 5 is still present in hardware, so you have to write 5 times to the mapper.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=38">Bregalad</a> — Wed Apr 06, 2005 12:12 pm</p><hr />
