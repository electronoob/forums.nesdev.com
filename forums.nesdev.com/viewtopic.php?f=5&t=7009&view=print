<br />Seriously?  *I* personally have nothing but good/great things to say regarding your contributions to the dev/emu community and your posts here and PMs and real-time help you've provided to me in the past.

<br />From what I've seen around here, a lot of people just need to lighten up and stop taking everything so damn seriously. I understand it's nice to have serious discussion when it's time to be serious, but that's no reason for everyone to be so tense and defensive all the time.
<br />
<br />Also, in before this post is completely disregarded. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" />

There is no possible way you have generated enough ill will to gain anything productive from a posting such as this.
<br />
<br />If there is never a difference is opinion then nothing is really gained from discussion and a forum such as this serves little purpose.

<br />
<br />There have been a few times, however, where I've been bothered by the way you've communicated with other users, myself included. Like Peppers has mentioned, I think you may sometimes create problems that don't exist. I remember one time where we were discussion who could be a new moderator, and I said something about "we don't need a tyrant", and you were asking me if I was calling you a tyrant. I of course, wasn't. That reading too much in to things can hurt sometimes.
<br />
<br />Another time was when a new user posted a question in the Newbie Help Center, and your response was a link to "How to ask questions the smart way". That kind of thing, I think we could do without. You don't need to make people feel stupid, especially when they're new users who already feel stupid for asking basic questions.
<br />
<br />The only other thing I find is that there is often just a slight vibe of negativity/pessimism in a lot of your posts. For that reason, it just doesn't surprise me that you created a topic like this, where as I'd be shocked if someone like tokumaru created a topic like this. I use tokumaru as an example, because I find him to be a very -optimistic- user. It seems as if you want to focus on the bad side of things sometimes.
<br />
<br />I think you just need to lighten up. Have a more welcoming attitude. You've provided the NESdev community with so much information, it's ridiculous. Your presence is most certainly a "plus"; I just think it could be more of a "plus" if you showed a little more optimism/positivity.

<br />
<br />As for me I have a major problem only with people who "kindly" ask how to make illegal bootlegs of their "favourite" (S)NES game (which is often a valuable one by collectors), to sell them later and make a lot of cash.
<br />I also have a major problem with a specific member of this board  (it's not blarg nor anyone who has been around recently) for a similar reason ("kindly" asking stuff here and earning lot of money from the answers), and I clearly stated it and explained why back when the problem became apparent to me. Since then I haven't ever posted in any of his threads because I don't want anyone to earn money from my advice.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Bregalad's objections are similar to why I sometimes get annoyed at new people's questions.
<br />
<br />* Very little information about the problem posted.
<br />* Information left out because the problem clearly couldn't be due to those things (or could it?).
<br />* Original posts editied or heavily modified once problem is solved, without any posting of what the solution was. In other words, "hey, solve my problem, and then I'll just delete everything since I'm satisfied, never mind that it won't help anyone else".
<br />* Not listening to responses given.
<br />
<br />That's part of the more general thing that annoys me, is people doing things that seem a detriment to discussions. That's what <a href="http://www.catb.org/esr/faqs/smart-questions.html" class="postlink">How to ask questions the smart way</a> is about&#058; getting help in a way that isn't a zero-sum exchange between you and others. Anyone who has ever used Usenet is probably familiar with people who post a question but request that solutions be emailed, the classic selfish behavior that is purely zero-sum.
<br />
<br />I agree with Celius that I have a negative tone a lot, but I disagree that one can just "lighten up" any more than one can get angry on command (method actors excluded). In fact, my experience has shown that ignoring things is the surest way to make them worse. Sure, it'd be nice to not get angry about anything, but it's not really a choice. I would like to deal with things better, which is one reason I started this thread. Interaction is the best way to alter perception, for example why I asked if Celius was calling me a tyrant in that incident a while back he mentioned. Merely ignoring it wouldn't make the perception on my part go away. Again, one cannot merely just "lighten up", and it's a bit frustrating to be told to do that. Thus, I asked him about it and altered my perception in a meaningful way. There's no question that much of my issues arise from outside nesdev, but there's not much I can do about it (I've tried for many years without success), so I've got to just deal with it as best as I can.
