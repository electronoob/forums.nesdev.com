		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Regarding the Rat Race:
<br />
<br />There are tricks.  If you can time it right (things have to be just so), you can punch the rate as you fall and he'll turn around.  Usually this does more harm than good, but it can work out if you know what you're doing.  You can also time it so the 3rd rat will hit those moving platforms at just the wrong time -- giving you an early substantial lead, making that 3rd section much easier.
<br />
<br />The Rat Race is by FAR my favorite level in that game.  The music, the feeling of urgency, everything about it is just awesome -- one of the few games that still gets my heart pumping when I play it.
<br />
<br />Anyway -- I've pretty much mastered Battletoads.  I can consistently go through it with no game overs (maxed out score of 999999 by Clinger Winger or earlier, usually, but I don't pay that much attention to my score).  Not counting The Revolution and bosses, I'd say I die on average 5 times per runthrough (now that I think about it, that might even be a generous estimate -- it's probably more like 2 or 3).  Revolution still gives me some trouble sometimes, and the Storm Trooper at the top of the Elevator shaft still kicks my ass now and then.
<br />
<br />Never the 5-life code -- never warp -- never abuse savestates.  ;D
<br />
<br />EDIT  --   Also...
<br />
<br />I don't know if this has been mentioned -- but getting through the game with two players isn't <em>virtually</em> impossible -- it actually IS impossible.  There's a fatal glitch in Clinger Winger where the second player cannot move and all and he'll just get killed by the spiral guy right as the level starts every time.  I've gotten there with a friend a few times before (with heavy savestate abuse as my friend kind of sucks).
<br />
<br />An online guy I know, Drag, experienced this problem as well and looked into it.  Apparently each toad is given a counter that starts counting down every frame --  and the toad cannot move until that counter reaches zero.  The problem is, the counter doesn't start counting until the toad gets to his Clinger thing -- and Zitz (second toad) doesn't get to his Clinger thing until several frames AFTER Rash (1P) gets to his -- so his timer is still counting down even after Rash, and the spiral enemy, are already on the move.

<br />
<br />I remember reading something like this on the web at a time, but just put it off as BS, perhaps caused by some old low-quality emulator. Guess I was wrong then. :) 
<br />
<br />However, no such problem on the clinger-winger level is present on my PAL cart, so I suppose this is specific to the NTSC version? Which again makes me wonder which version was the first one, and which one is the port.
<br />
<br />But so much for the NTSC Battletoads cart I own then. I think it will keep collecting dust even if I get myself an NTSC television set somehow. I can imagine the fury two people must feel after getting themselves to the clinger-winger level, only to see their effort overthrown by such a nasty bug.

<br />But for now I guess I can only just imagine the hellish difficulty of the Revolution with 2 players.  I have a hard enough time with it on 1 player.

<br />I also wonder about that. I think the PAL version is the original, because Rare is a british game company, and the games doesn't use tricky sanline stuff in the PAL version - only in the NTSC version.
<br />Also, there seems to have more glitches in the NTSC version (while the PAL still have glitches).
<br />In level 3, when you fall in the lava at the first section there is a glitch only in PAL, when your toad reapars there is lava falling from it (it's hard to explain). I did only show this under emulation, but I doubt emulators are wrong when it comes to sprite rendering.

<br />What emulator are you using? (It should be Nestopia or Nintendulator.)
