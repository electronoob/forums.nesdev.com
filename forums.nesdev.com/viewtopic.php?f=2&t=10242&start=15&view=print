It is simpler to make a recursive descent parser, plus you don't need other tools than your favorite compiler in your favorite language.<br /><br />Also, technically, any function not marked as &quot;static&quot; are extern, that is, you can always type &quot;extern&quot; / &quot;static&quot; in front of a function definition/declaration (but you should be consistent).

Release 0.4 will be logic-complete and capable of initializing and interacting with the NES hardware. Releases 0.5 and 0.6 will add more expressiveness to the language.

We compile via command line, then boot in a emu/hardware which gives us the test suite of our liking.  A test harness for your compiler would be nice, but you might be able to get around it.  Having a sensible assembly output that can be checked by the user if the suspect issues is sufficient for now.  Do your testing, for those of us interested in your beta builds we can expect bugs/fixes being needed.  To some degree beta testers can be your test harness for the compiler.

Small game is normally like 1000-2000 lines of code in C, which is maybe not a great reliability test, but still some material to debug the compiler, catch regressions, and improve code generation.

The author will need to understand the overhead of a subroutine return. Interestingly, allowing expressions as subroutine parameters can improve efficiency in some cases.<br /><br />I'll leave fastcall for later.

I'll lop off the .uc bit of the file name so it looks a bit cleaner.<br /><br />The issue you've found with return values is quite embarrassing. I guess I never assembled that test file.
