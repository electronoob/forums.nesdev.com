		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />OK, so you can all call me Geebs, Mario, Gary, or Jerkwad if you feel necessary. But I am/was the author of MarioNES and 80Five. 
<br />
<br />NES emulation is the only project and have stayed with(though sporadically) over any real amount of time.
<br />
<br />I like to start projects and never see them finish for some reason.  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /> 
<br />
<br />Well, I had started working on 80Five again, to try to implement the Game Genie, or something of some sort of use. But it had been a long time since I coded anything and I had deleted all my NES tech docs a while back. Well I was getting somewhere, but then my hard drive crashed and I lost it all.
<br />
<br />So I am starting over. Maybe I can make something a little more accurate. I still have the source from the last releases of MarioNES and 80Five, but honestly, that code is atrocious. I have gotten much better at writing clean code since I wrote those. And I am switching to using <a href="http://www.FreeBASIC.net." class="postlink">FreeBasic</a> instead of Visual Basic. So its going to be a whole new experience and emulator. Its supposedly easy to convert C++ to FreeBASIC(Maybe I can learn C++ converting some of the example code and things you guys show me, because I dont know C++ at all)
<br />
<br />I expect you will all see a lot more of me in the future as I will be asking a lot of questions, its been a while since I did anything that intensive that has to do with the NES or 6502, but I am excited. There is also a small learning curve I need to get over when it comes to FreeBASIC, Its a lot like basic, but somewhat different so its gonna be a bit harder.
<br />
<br />But yeah, just wanted to let you all know that I am working on it, and introduce myself.
<br />
<br />Hi, I'm Me.

<br />
<br />Why freebasic?  Since you're already a C/C++ coder, why not take a look at something a little more familiar (and at least as powerful).
<br />
<br />I'm big on using D, and I strongly encourage you to check it out before you jump into any serious coding:
<br />
<br /><a href="http://www.digitalmars.com/d" class="postlink">http://www.digitalmars.com/d</a>
<br /><a href="http://www.dsource.org/" class="postlink">http://www.dsource.org/</a>
<br />
<br />Basically it gives you link-level compatibility with C, OOP and a GC all with compile-time goodness (no interpreters, virtual machines, or intermediate languages), without any of the messyness of C++, and a syntax familiar to both C++ and Java developers.
<br />
<br />(if you have any questions about it, feel free to PM me)

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I believe you misunderstood me, I have no knowledge of C/C++, or very very little in any case. I am a BASIC coder however. I started in QBASIC, then went on to Visual Basic, and a smidgen of Pascal. With a whole lot of web programming languages tossed in.
<br />
<br />I chose FreeBASIC because first, its BASIC. Its what I am most comfortable with. Its not widely used for this sort of thing, and FreeBASIC seems to be a fairly powerful language. At least, more powerful than qbasic and its seemingly more powerful than VB 6.
<br />
<br />I'll take a look at D though, it seems pretty interesting.

I stopped going to benheck as much because I ran out of time(and consoles) to modify so I lost interest(and gained jealousy) in reading what other people were doing. That and the sharp incline in the immaturity on the boards at the time. But I'll leave that be. I do however pop in there and read a topic now and then. I just dont usually post, except for today... as you may have seen.
