<br />I second that. Looks like there's 3 movements when jumping.

<br />
<br />The video quality might be obscuring a few things, but I wish the attack at 0:40 had more visual oomph behind it. Also, some enemies are hard to make out against the background (also at 0:40 especially).
<br />
<br />Nevertheless, it's looking pretty good so far. The dragon is definitely one of those impressive huge "shit-in-pants" NES bosses. He is looking sinister, but also very lonely to me. How long has he been dwelling in that cave?

(The basis is there...but it would benefit from a bit more tempo imo)
<br />Great job! <img src="./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" />
<br />
<br />edit: I mostly mean the music in the first part...the second part + boss are more of the tempo I speak off.

<br />If you can't beat the first level yourself, nobody will be able to though. A game is harder in the hand of someone who didnt' make it.
<br />
<br />Also the graphics are a bit weird to me. The enemies looks almost invisible, maybe they need to be more polished ? Is it on purpose that there is a pattern of hearts symbols appearing on the big boss ?

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />The game itself looks very good. There are some improvements like not always ruining jumps with enemies in the way. Hard to tell from the video, but the play control could use just a hint of acceleration when starting to move right or left from standstill. But obviously if that earlier era feel is what you're going for, that's fine too.
<br />
<br />I like that the player's character moves towards the edge of the screen when reaching the edges of the level, instead of remaining in the middle.
<br />
<br />Areas with some vertical scrolling would be nice too.
<br />
<br />
<br />Guys, come on. I find it insulting to pull out the Action 52 references. Anyone's project with new and unknown characters and environments is going seem kind of foreign in that way, as in not giving that warm fuzzy feeling of childhood nostalgia. There don't seem to be totally out of place enemies and broken jump mechanics.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I agree with Whicker. Saying the game look like action 52 is just bashing: explaining possible issues in the play mechanics or that could have impact on the game itself (i.e. enemies that blend with background) which would lead in the end in improving the game is constructive criticism.
<br />
<br />People seems to forget that most people are working alone on their game(s) and we're doing that for fun.  We don't have talent in all area of the creation of the game itself and it may show. I know that for myself that if I would make my own sprite it would suck like hell but programming is not an issue.  This is one reason I liked the MM9 porting since I didn't have to draw any sprite and it helped to make my game engine move forward.
<br />
<br />If it was a commercial game in the time of the nes era I could understand the harsh criticism but it's not the case: it a game made by someone that do it for fun because he like the nes.
