The procedure for compiling bsnes-mcfly on Windows is a bit involved, and I don't think a beginner should attempt it right away.<br /><br />For starters, have you ever compiled higan before? You won't need Cygwin; Cygwin is designed to make the POSIX API available for use on Windows, which higan was carefully designed to not need. Instead, you need to use <a href="http://mingw-w64.org/" class="postlink">MinGW-w64</a> (I think it will work on 32-bit Windows as well, but I'm not sure). Make sure that it is in your PATH. If you use an installer, the PATH should be handled automatically for you.<br /><br />In case you're wondering, the reason why Visual Studio won't work is that it lags behind on support for C++14, which is used heavily by higan and bsnes, and bsnes-mcfly with them.<br /><br />Once you have MinGW-w64, attempt to compile <a href="https://download.byuu.org/higan_v106-source.7z" class="postlink">higan v106</a> or <a href="https://gitlab.com/higan/higan/tree/93a6a1ce7e93e97d16d8a897a1d198fe76c21651" class="postlink">bsnes v106r57</a>. To do this, navigate into the higan/ directory where there's a file named “GNUmakefile”, then type “mingw32-make”. If you're compiling bsnes, you may need to type “mingw32-make target=bsnes”. If all goes well, you should have higan.exe or bsnes.exe in the higan/out/ directory.<br /><br />In order to compile bsnes-mcfly, you will additionally need <a href="https://download.qt.io/official_releases/qt/5.10/5.10.1/" class="postlink">the source code of Qt 5.10.1</a>. When you have that, follow the instructions in bsnes-mcfly's included README.txt file to compile Qt (also available in <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/viewtopic.php?f=12&amp;t=17377&amp;start=120#p222635" class="postlink">this post</a>).<br /><br />================================<br /><br />Regarding unlicensed game compatibility, I have only this to say:<br /><br />bsnes-mcfly's new unlicensed boards database will fill in the gaps left behind by byuu's licensed boards database, but <strong>only for games that bsnes v073 supported</strong>. This includes Bad Apple (ExHiROM without RAM).<br /><br />It does not include the DSP1 tech demo (malformed header). bsnes v073 was the first version of bsnes to incorporate low-level emulation of the uPD7725 (DSP1, Dungeon Master, SD Gundam GX, Top Gear 3000), so already a cartridge folder would have been required (bsnes v073 did not support concatenated firmware like the upcoming bsnes v107). But even beyond that, the DSP1 tech demo does not have a properly formatted header, so in the absence of a manifest, bsnes v073 and bsnes v072 (the last HLE version) both assume a LoROM without a uPD7725.<br /><br /><img src="https://i.imgur.com/lY6PT1I.png" alt="Image" /><br /><br />I suppose I could force detection of a DSP1 if the firmware is concatenated by taking an SHA256 hash of the last 8192 bytes of the ROM (and therefore allow combination coprocessors such as DSP1+Super FX), but the DSP1 tech demo was not released with a concatenated firmware, so I doubt that would solve anything.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=7009">hex_usr</a> — Tue Aug 14, 2018 6:11 pm</p><hr />

angrylion asked about loading both games as “plain .sfc files”. I just provided an option that would avoid creating manifests, because those are primarily associated with cartridge folders, and I can't assume that angrylion has no opposition to placing a manifest right next to the ROM, even if it technically doesn't need to be in a .sfc folder.<br /><br />...oh, but Bad Apple works in bsnes v073 without a manifest, doesn't it? Dang, I don't really like the idea, but I did say that I would “take any legal means to replace bsnes v073”, so...<br /><br />I will create a supplemental boards database in order to fill in the gaps that byuu has left in his boards database. Its first entry will be “EXHIROM” without a “-RAM” suffix, so that Bad Apple will work without the need to edit the ROM or supply a manifest. Unfortunately, there is no way to also support the DSP1 prototype in the same way. Even if the firmware is concatenated, it's either supply a manifest, or edit the ROM. I don't think bsnes v073 supports it manfest-free either (although bsnes v072 and earlier have high-level emulation, bsnes-classic was not forked from those versions), so I shouldn't have to worry about that one, at least.<br /><br />Annoying reminder: bsnes-mcfly tries to compete with bsnes v073 and bsnes-classic. It does not try to compete with the official bsnes v107. If you are satisfied with bsnes v107, I recommend that you continue to use it so that you don't have to suffer the bug's nest that is Qt.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=7009">hex_usr</a> — Tue Aug 07, 2018 5:05 pm</p><hr />

If the ROM header is not properly formatted, bsnes-mcfly won't be able to figure out that a DSP1 is required. The same is true of the official bsnes, and when importing the ROM in icarus for use in higan. You will need to either supply a manifest, or edit the ROM in a hex editor.<br /><br />If you choose to supply a manifest, place the manifest in the same directory as the ROM and name it the same as the ROM but with the “.bml” extension. Here's the manifest:<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">game<br />  sha256:   42ff54a03c2c8f42daa1d4e342464abde303df4e90dcf17173f36ec01702e887<br />  label:    DSP1 Prototype<br />  name:     DSP1 Prototype<br />  //serial:   SN-10<br />  region:   NTSC<br />  revision: 1.0<br />  //board:    SHVC-2Q5B-03<br />  board:    NEC-LOROM<br />    memory<br />      type: ROM<br />      size: 0x20000<br />      content: Program<br />    memory<br />      type: ROM<br />      size: 0x1800<br />      content: Program<br />      manufacturer: NEC<br />      architecture: uPD7725<br />      identifier: DSP1<br />    memory<br />      type: ROM<br />      size: 0x800<br />      content: Data<br />      manufacturer: NEC<br />      architecture: uPD7725<br />      identifier: DSP1<br />    memory<br />      type: RAM<br />      size: 0x200<br />      content: Data<br />      manufacturer: NEC<br />      architecture: uPD7725<br />      identifier: DSP1<br />      volatile</div><br /><br />If you choose the hex editor route, you will need to go to $7FB0, and overwrite the 48 bytes of FF that you find there with the following:<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">30 30 44 53 50 31 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00<br />44 53 50 31 20 50 72 6F 74 6F 74 79 70 65 20 20<br />20 20 20 20 20 20 03 07 00 0E 33 00 12 07 ED F8</div><br />Also, I don't think I need to say this, but make sure you have the DSP1 firmware in little endian format. The preferred form is to concatenate the firmware directly to the end of the ROM that uses it, but you can also put it in the firmware/ directory where bsnes-mcfly is installed. Even though the performance profile has high-level emulation of the DSP1, it requires the firmware in order to validate the DSP program. I made it that way in order to not relieve any pressure on No-Intro to bundle the firmwares with the ROMs that use them.<br /><br />As for Bad Apple, bsnes-mcfly does recognize that the ROM is an ExHiROM, but unfortunately, the Board database that is borrowed from higan does not define a board for ExHiROM without any cartridge RAM (both Tales of Phantasia and Daikaijuu Monogatari II have cartridge RAM), so Bad Apple won't work without a manifest, or unless you edit the header to indicate the presence of cartridge RAM. For the latter, change byte $40FFD8 from 0x00 to 0x05.<br /><br />You could ask byuu to add an entry to the Boards database for ExHiROM without RAM, but because no commercial game was ever released using it, I doubt he will agree to add it for you.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=7009">hex_usr</a> — Tue Aug 07, 2018 5:41 am</p><hr />

Similarly, Koushien 2 and Rendering Ranger R2 will automatically activate the cycle-based DSP timing while still using the OpenMP-based PPU in the Compatibility profile. The speed hit will be pretty minor compared to Air Strike Patrol.</s><br /></div><br />Oops, I forgot... I disabled automatic profile switching because of a crashing bug. When enabled, if you load a game in the Accuracy profile, and then load the same game again in the Compatibility profile without a full restart first, bsnes-mcfly will crash.<br /><br />This bug affects the official bsnes as well (using the Fast PPU checkbox), and it even affects the latest v106r56 WIP release. I know byuu previously attempted a fix to work around the 1-game lag in calculating the save state size, but I guess it doesn't work as expected.<br /><br />The PPU and DSP are selected within SuperFamicom::System::load(), and serializeInit() is also called within the same function. But in bsnes, hackCompatibility() is called after emulator-&gt;load() has already been called... which means that it doesn't even have the intended effect and will run Air Strike Patrol with no visible shadow.<br /><br />I had a fix for the save state size's 1-game lag, but I dropped it because I thought byuu's fix would work. This was what I used:<br /><br />sfc/system/system.cpp<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">auto System::load(Emulator::Interface* interface) -&gt; bool {<br />  //...<br />  bus.reset();<br />  if(!cartridge.load()) return false;<br /><br />  hacks.fastPPU = settings.fastPPU;<br />  hacks.fastDSP = settings.fastDSP;<br /><br />  if(!cpu.load(system)) return false;<br />  if(!smp.load(system)) return false;<br />  if(!ppu.load(system)) return false;<br />  if(!dsp.load(system)) return false;<br />  //...<br />  serializeInit();<br />  this-&gt;interface = interface;<br />  return information.loaded = true;<br />}</div><br />I loaded the cartridge first. This was required in order to read the ROM header. Then I set the hack settings, and loaded the PPU and DSP afterwards.<br /><br />...but even that doesn't fix this crash bug now. And GDB doesn't help, it just says that the crash happened in a Windows DLL.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=7009">hex_usr</a> — Mon Aug 06, 2018 4:26 am</p><hr />

Oops, I knew I forgot something. I had hoped that you could just use the precompiled Qt DLLs that I included in the ZIP download, and maybe that's technically true, but you still need to have moc (Qt's meta object compiler) and rcc (Qt's resource compiler) in order to compile bsnes-mcfly. And in order to get those, you'll need to compile Qt yourself.<br /><br />And the PATH isn't supposed to point to “&lt;qt-install-dir&gt;\qtbase”, it's supposed to point to “&lt;qt-install-dir&gt;\qtbase\bin” instead. Sorry about that.<br /><br />Did you read the included README.txt by any chance? I included directions for compiling Qt in there. I'll include the relevant section below:<br /><br />If you wish to compile Qt yourself on Windows, you will need MinGW-w64 SEH.<br />TDM-GCC has not been updated since 2015 and will not work.<br /><br />Open qtbase/mkspecs/win32-g++/qmake.conf and change the following properties:<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">QMAKE_LINK   = $${CROSS_COMPILE}g++ -static-libgcc -static-libstdc++<br />QMAKE_LINK_C = $${CROSS_COMPILE}gcc -static-libgcc -static-libstdc++</div><br /><br />Navigate to Qt's root directory and run the following command with no line breaks:<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">configure -prefix %CD%\qtbase -release -opensource -confirm-license -nomake tests -nomake examples -no-opengl -no-zlib -skip qt3d -skip activeqt -skip qtandroidextras -skip qtcanvas3d -skip qtcharts -skip qtconnectivity -skip qtdatavis3d -skip qtgamepad -skip qtlocation -skip qtmacextras -skip qtnetworkauth -skip qtpurchasing -skip qtserialbus -skip qtspeech -skip qtwebglplugin -skip qtx11extras</div><br />Navigate to qtbase/ and run “mingw32-make”. This can take a while. You can optionally add a “-j#” option, where # is the number of simultaneous compilation jobs. The number of CPU cores you have minus 1 is a good number.<br /><br />When it is done, you will find some DLLs in the directory where you installed Qt's source. Here's where each one needs to be copied:<br /><ul><li>qtbase/lib/Qt5Core.dll → &lt;bsnes-mcfly&gt;/</li><li>qtbase/lib/Qt5Gui.dll → &lt;bsnes-mcfly&gt;/</li><li>qtbase/lib/Qt5Widgets.dll → &lt;bsnes-mcfly&gt;/</li><li>qtbase/plugins/platforms/qwindows.dll → &lt;bsnes-mcfly&gt;/platforms/</li><li>qtbase/plugins/styles/qwindowsvistastyle.dll → &lt;bsnes-mcfly&gt;/styles/</li></ul><br />If you need to recompile Qt, run “mingw32-make distclean -j#” first. (substitute # with the number of simultaneous jobs)<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=7009">hex_usr</a> — Sat Aug 04, 2018 4:11 am</p><hr />

<div class="quotetitle">007 wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"><br />I dont know how to compile this but if you want me to compile on my Haswell and submit/test Im willing to learn.<br /></div><br />You will need <a href="http://mingw-w64.org/doku.php/download" class="postlink">MinGW-w64</a> and the <a href="https://download.qt.io/official_releases/qt/5.10/5.10.1/single/" class="postlink">source code to Qt 5</a>; Visual Studio probably won't work because it has historically been incompatible with the C++14 standard that higan and bsnes use. I use Qt 5.10.1, but bsnes-mcfly has been tested as far back as Qt 5.7.<br /><br />Once you have extracted both of those, make sure you have the directories <s>“&lt;qt-install-dir&gt;\qtbase”</s> “&lt;qt-install-dir&gt;\qtbase\bin” and “&lt;mingw-install-dir&gt;\bin” in your PATH. If you install MinGW-w64 with an installer, the latter directory should be automatically handled for you.<br /><br />Then, navigate to where you installed bsnes-mcfly's source code and run cc.bat. I designed cc.bat to run the “pause” command if it detects that compilation failed, so it won't automatically close and prevent you from seeing any important error messages like most batch files do. cc.bat will compile the Accuracy and Compatibility profiles into bsnes\out\bsnes-mcfly.exe, so if you want the Performance profile, you'll have to go into the command prompt and run “mingw32-make profile=performance” from within the bsnes\ directory.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">007 wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"><br />even switching filters<br /></div><br />Crashing on switching filters was an unrelated bug, caused by me being overzealous with optimizations and rendering directly into ruby's video buffer instead of using an intermediate buffer. I think I fixed that already in bsnes-mcfly v106r10, didn't I?<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">007 wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"><br />I have one suggestion, the description of compatible core states to switch to accuracy for the few problematic games.<br /></div><br />The “few problematic games” mentioned in that description refer to Air Strike Patrol, which requires the Accuracy profile's PPU in order to draw a shadow under your plane, and Koushien 2 and Rendering Ranger R2, which both require cycle-based DSP timing (the Compatibility profile uses sample-based timing). <s>Go ahead and try to run those games in the Compatibility profile; you&#39;ll find that Air Strike Patrol will slow down the emulator to just barely faster than the Accuracy profile, because bsnes-mcfly looks up the internal ROM header&#39;s name &#40;“AIR STRIKE PATROL” or “DESERT FIGHTER” for the NTSC-J region&#41; and automatically activates the Accuracy profile&#39;s PPU, though it still uses the Compatibility profile&#39;s sample-based DSP timing. Similarly, Koushien 2 and Rendering Ranger R2 will automatically activate the cycle-based DSP timing while still using the OpenMP-based PPU in the Compatibility profile. The speed hit will be pretty minor compared to Air Strike Patrol.</s><br /><br />Note that the Performance profile does not automatically activate parts of other profiles like this. If you run Air Strike Patrol in the Performance profile, the plane shadow will be invisible.<br /><br />I could name those games directly in the description, but would that be legally safe? Could Nintendo or SETA find a reason to sue me for mentioning which games won't work with certain features? I already have a tooltip for the Double VRAM option that mentions that Yoshi's Island will look like a garbled mess with 128 KB VRAM (hover your mouse cursor over the checkbox to see it), and I'm a little iffy on that, too.<br /><br />EDIT: Corrected the PATH for Qt.<br /><br />EDIT 2: Whoops, forgot that I disabled automatic profile switching because of a crashing bug.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=7009">hex_usr</a> — Fri Aug 03, 2018 4:41 pm</p><hr />
