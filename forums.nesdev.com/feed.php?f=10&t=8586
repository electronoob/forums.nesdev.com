The default platform linker scripts are built into ld65. You can see the NES script at <a href="ftp://ftp.musoftware.de/pub/uz/cc65/snapshot/sources/cc65-snapshot-2.13.9.20120127/src/ld65/cfg/nes.cfg" class="postlink">ftp://ftp.musoftware.de/pub/uz/cc65/snapshot/sources/cc65-snapshot-2.13.9.20120127/src/ld65/cfg/nes.cfg</a><br /><br />It's basically designed for use with cc65 and not really what most ca65 users would expect. Which is why most people write their own. (Which are usually much less complex than this.)<br /><br />So, yes, the vectors section starts at $FFF6 and it's size is $C. No, that doesn't make any sense, but that's how it is. Which means that the code that you've got is buggy. (Or was written for a similar, but differently screwed up linker script.) Each of those zeros is 2 bytes (which is what '.word' means). The end result is this:<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">00FFF6  00 00<br />00FFF8  00 00<br />00FFFA  00 00  ; NMI<br />00FFFC  nmi    ; reset<br />00FFFE  reset  ; IRQ/BRK<br />010000  irq<br /></div><br />Which I doubt would link at all.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3412">Karatorian</a> — Sun Feb 05, 2012 3:04 pm</p><hr />

I have to know more than what a given script is doing in order to design my own.<br /><br />I guess one of the reasons I don't like linking scripts is that they are just one more thing you have to design, and consequently one more thing you might want to redesign in the future when you notice the flaws of the one you're using. Also, due to the fact that I develop on several different computers, I like to keep everything (source, documents, tools, etc.) in a single archive, so it's better that the tools are simple and small. I can't rely on make files or other things that require setting up a complex development environment.<br /><br />I appreciate your offer though, and I'll be sure to ask you any questions I might have about this in case I decide to give CA65 another shot someday.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=95">tokumaru</a> — Sun Feb 05, 2012 9:44 am</p><hr />

The zeroes before the vectors are really puzzling me... Then again, I don't use CA65, so this might be related to some peculiarity of that assembler. I can assure you that this has nothing to do with mappers, and that only the last 6 bytes are used by the CPU as vectors. I have no idea what those zeroes are doing there.<br /><br />Sorry if I can't help with the CA65-specific questions. Having to build scripts before being able to assemble my programs has really put me off (and I don't feel well using scripts other people made unless I completely understand them). The possibility of using segments is hardly worth the trouble IMO. I've been using ASM6, and I have no trouble making sure that everything ends up in the correct places in the NES file myself. From what I heard CA65 is very good though, so I hope you get your answers.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=95">tokumaru</a> — Sun Feb 05, 2012 8:14 am</p><hr />

I don't remember where I found it, but I'm looking at a .asm file that's essentially a hello world program, and it raises a number of questions for a noob like me, despite consisting mostly of comments and very little code.<br /><br />1. The beginning of the file has hardly any comments.<br /><br />.segment "HEADER"<br />    .byte "NES", 26, 2, 1<br />    <br />; CHR ROM data<br />.segment "CHARS"<br /><br />.segment "VECTORS"<br />    .word 0, 0, 0, nmi, reset, irq<br />    <br />.segment "STARTUP"<br /><br />.segment "CODE"<br /><br />I've been trying to read up on this, and I think CA65 uses these segments keywords to determine where in the resulting .NES file it will put your data upon assembly/compilation (are they the same, by the way?), since e.g. CHR data has to be in a certain address range within the .NES, though if I'm wrong about this, please do correct me. Anyway, is this the full list of possible segments? If not, where can I find such a list, if one exists?<br /><br />2. [ANSWERED] This particular .asm file has the following labels:<br />reset<br />@vblankwait1<br />@clrmem<br />@vblankwait2<br />forever<br />irq<br />nmi<br /><br />What is the purpose of having an @ at the beginning of a label?<br /><br />3. What is the significance or purpose of the leading 3 zeroes, here?<br /><br />.segment "VECTORS"<br />    .word 0, 0, 0, nmi, reset, irq<br /><br />If I got this right, the NMI vector is at $FFFA, so whenever an NMI occurs, the program goes to the NMI label (which is located at the address stored at $FFFA) and starts running the code there. The address to this label is 2 bytes long ($FFFA). Do each of the leading zeroes also represent 2 bytes, i.e. does the vectors segment start at $FFF4? Which interrupts do the first 3 zeroes correspond to? Are they only used by mappers, and is that why they have been set to 0 in this particular program (which doesn't use mappers)?<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3495">Dafydd</a> — Sun Feb 05, 2012 6:54 am</p><hr />
