That's good news because the 39SF010A chips I've ordered arrived just today. So once I manage to add reliable support for this chip to my flashing routines (which shouldn't be too much of a hassle), you'll all be able to update. Let's just hope revD's and revE/H's hardware design isn't so different as to ruin my efforts.<br /><br />I'll definitely look into it this weekend. Stay tuned! <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />Edit: Took me long enough, but I succeeded! Flashing the SST39SF010A works totally different than flashing the AT29C010A, though. Before being able to reliably rewrite so much as a single byte, you have to erase the 4KB sector that contains that byte. (With the AT29C010A, you don't have to erase anything first but instead make sure that 128 bytes are written at a time, i.e. before data polling or checking the toggle bit.) So for the record, I have two completely independent flashing routines implemented by now. The updater automatically determines which one to use depending on the respective type of flash ROM chip the PowerPak has installed. Yay! What's left to do is code optimization as well as some more testing. Seems like a final release is drawing near! <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />

It never really worked for me either, although I was able to get a few tunes playing (though sometimes only until a song started looping). My release incorporates blargg's SPC player (ported over from sd2snes), which does the job like a charm. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />You'll have to update in order to benefit from it, though. I don't really feel like backporting any new CF module features to v1.0X. My in-system flash updater is basically finished, someone else apart from myself should put it to the test before release, though.<br /><br />Any socketed SST39SF010A users who happen to have a PLCC32 programmer available and would like to try out the flasher, please PM me.<br /><br />Thanks! <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br />Ramsis

Ignore the &quot;other&quot; directory (it contains the flash module source code and a full bootloader ROM file for manual programming). On powering up your PowerPak, you should be prompted to update. Don't worry about glitchy graphics, especially if your previous ROM is v2.00-betaX.<br /><br />Some warnings:<br /><span style="color: #FF0000"><ul><li>This is unofficial software.

One thing that would make more people interested or aware would be if it wasn't burried in a thread with so many pages of replies and if a list of features/improvements even comparison pictures were presented. Ofcourse the popularity of the Super EverDrive and SD2SNES mean there are probably less PowerPAK owners than there otherwise would be. <br /><br />I know the improvements include wider resolution for filenames to fit nicer, different backgrounds and logos. But a complete list that's right where people will see it is a good idea. I didn't check the archive yet, maybe it is in there.<br /><br />Well I flipped back a few pages to find a <a href="http://www.manuloewe.de/snestuff/powerpak/firmware-v2.00-changes.txt" class="postlink">changes list</a> but I think this whole thing deserves its own thread don't you?

There's just a much, much higher risk involved in trying. Should anything go wrong -- say, a power failure occurs during the ~3 seconds it takes to rewrite the chip --, a revH PowerPak couldn't be repaired as easily as e.g. a revE, where you'd just have to take out the ROM chip and reflash it using an external programming device.<br /><br />So - the decision is yours, as is the risk. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_surprised.gif" alt=":o" title="Surprised" /> <br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">MottZilla wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">One thing that would make more people interested or aware would be if it wasn't burried in a thread with so many pages of replies and if a list of features/improvements even comparison pictures were presented.</div><br />The first two betas were announced/released on my <a href="http://www.manuloewe.de/" class="postlink">personal blog</a>.
