<br />I almost got everything good and set for the NES version, the only thing preventing me is POINTERS that are using &lt; and &gt;, I wonder how I can bypass these without using hex values for pointers?
<br />
<br />EDIT: If anyone made a better assembler that is compatible with ASM6/CA65, yet uses PC-Engine's HuC6280, which is a 65CS02 Variant, Post it here
<br />
<br />(and Do NOT Say WLA-DX)

<br />If PCEAS is just like NESASM, except for supporting the extra instructions of the HuC6280, then WLA-DX <strong>is</strong> a better assembler. Whether it's easier to use is a different matter..
<br />
<br />Btw: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvlfoMiy9dU&amp;feature=player_detailpage#t=10s" class="postlink">SMB on PC-E</a>. Dunno what the hell they did with the music. I guess they didn't have proper info on how the NES APU works.

One problem with that conversion was that they're using a 50Hz PAL ROM, so the speed of the game (including the music) would be too fast. (AFAIK there was never a "50Hz" PAL PCE. The European TG16s were the same but included some circuit to convert the output signal to PAL50, so that games need not be reprogrammed for the PAL regions.)
<br />
<br />For FC-PCE conversions, <a href="http://pcedev.wordpress.com/" class="postlink">Tom</a> had already done some awesome works on it (including SMB of course) and Rockman indeed played great!
<br />
<br /><strong>Edit:</strong> The great thing is, he's included the sources and they're very educational. The way he mapped scratchpad RAM to both MPR 0 and 1 amazed me (I was wondering how he solved that Zero/Stack pages relocation problem without extensive patching before looking at the sources.)

<br />The NSF player I wrote for the Turbografx maps MPR 0, 1, 2 and 3 to the WorkRAM so that the NSF playback code can access ZP RAM, normal RAM, SRAM and the NES APU I/O regs all at once. There are a few songs for which this causes problems, so the best thing is to have a console/cart with BRAM and map MPR 2 to it.

<br />
<br />WLA DX is not that easy. Examples are differences in Syntax, You'd have to redo everything to make it work, 
<br />
<br />Examples are the .B/.W for opcodes, The linker is also what put most of us off, according to most members living with CA65/ASM6 syntax.
<br />
<br />EDIT: LDY Labelname,x does not work, whereas in other assemblers, work fine, I have to substitute it with a .DB!

The fastest SRAM chip I've seen used for BRAM was 150ns (of the systems I've taken apart). Others are slower. But even at 150ns, you're pushing your luck. Populous is the only game hucard that has extra ram (32k sram). But that limits you to 4megabit rom on the flash card (mednafen doesn't care and will map rom after the SRAM address).<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">If PCEAS is just like NESASM, except for supporting the extra instructions of the HuC6280, then WLA-DX is a better assembler.

<br />
<br /> There are a number of things that PCEAS does better than WLA-DX, but it's been so long that I don't remember what they were. But it was a significant difference for me to switch back to PCEAS. MooZ also switched over from WLA-DX after running into a number of problems where he couldn't replicate that of PCEAS for special code setups.
<br />
<br />Hamtaro126: Are you working with a table of pointers? Or just working with both? Low() and high() work fine, it's a pain if you have to type that out in tables. I modified PCEAS for .dbl and .dbh directives specifically for this, but it's not an official release.

<br />
<br />Yes, It uses &lt; and &gt; for pointers!
<br />
<br />Can you give me both Binaries and Source? I'd like to replace my current version of PCEAS with that,
<br />
<br />I might also add the DBL and DBH support to my NESASM!
<br />
<br />Can I release them in my releases? The source packs are gonna be enhanced along the line.
<br />
<br />My plan was to extend it with JJ and Jeff (or Ken Chan and Kato Chan) Music, But Midis are not happening, so PCE conversion seems to be an answer!

<br />
<br /> Also, I didn't fix all the bugs in PCEAS. There's a bug with .DATA define. But just ignore it and don't use .DATA. It's a useless directive in PCEAS because you can include data (binary) anywhere inside of '.code" areas. Just start off with <strong>.code </strong> in your main asm file and be done with it. The only time you would need to define .code again, is if you used <strong>.ZP</strong> or <strong>.BSS</strong> or (and I think .RS is ok) since they have their own bank and counter define. I.e. if you have a library file with its defined variables using those directives, make sure to use .code afterwards in that file you're including.
<br />
<br /> I included an asm source file in the binary build to explain some of the new changes. Read the text comments.
