If by blowing on your cart, you delay cleaning it, the corrosion could become worse.  Once the copper is gone, it's gone forever.  If your cart is oxydizing, leaving it that way will destroy it's ability to make a good connection permanently.</div></div>It's true!  The humidity from your breath can also speed the corrosion process.  I've only seen one 72-pin connector become irrecoverably damaged this way, but I've seen it happen.

They also say to don't clean it with alcool, that, I think, would have no negative effect, even if there would be no positive either. They could tell to users that de-ox would work instead, notices say to use Nintedo made cleaning kits, but I never saw any !! I doubt they did that just for money, heh.

<br />I think I still have an official NES cleaning kit manual. It says use water at first, but if that doesn't work, use 50% isopropyl alcohol. (Rubbing alcohol is 70% isopropanol.) The unlicensed cleaning kit had a mild detergent.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Okay, I bought an official game cleaning kit a while back, and the tools inside were usefull. But the solution was just rubbing alcohol. I agree that Nintendo thought that people were technologicly inept, and didn't know anything, and they thought they could just tell people that you couldn't use rubbing alcohol. That's a bunch of crap. You can totally just clean it with rubbing alcohol. It came with a thing that you stick in the cart connecter, and it is thick, so it is kind of hard to push in, then you pull it out, and the dirt comes off on the thing when you pull it out. I was like 8 when I bought it, so I didn't know. But you know what cleans carts really well? Fold a 3 x 3 (or around that size) sticky note in half 4 times one way, and 1 time in half the other. Then stick it in between the pins and the plastic part, and slide it each way from one end to another a bunch of times really fast, and when you pull out the sticky note, there'll be a whole bunch of dirt on it! If it's a really dirty cart. Works good all the same. Am I making any sense?
