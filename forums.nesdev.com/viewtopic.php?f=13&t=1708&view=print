<br />
<br />He's obviously trolling, but he's doing it in a "nice" way.  Like he'll apologize and say he'll stop, but he doesn't.  He's been evading bans by re-registering under a different nick (at least twice already).  He posts annoying random crap, he spams people with random PMs, and pretty much everything that comes out of his mouth is a blatant lie designed only to egg us on.
<br />
<br />He's been here for about 6 days and has almost 100 posts -- of which a grand total of zero have any substance.  It seems clear to me that he's one of these people that trolls messageboards by being a total douche, but avoids being banned by not *technically* breaking any rules.
<br />
<br />
<br />(yeah I know this doesn't really belong in this forum, but I didn't know where else to put it =P.  Gen discussion maybe?)

<br />
<br />A bunch of people complained about the original incarnation "donknotts" (and rightly so, as it acted like a complete idiot), so I banned that username (and then took out an entire IP range for the second one that showed up).
<br />
<br />If you think this 3rd incarnation is still being a disturbance, then post your opinions here.

<br /><div class="quotetitle">nensondubois wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">I have not done anything wrong.</div>
<br />
<br />Yes you have - you've wasted our time by posting pointless topics ("<a href="http://nesdev.com/bbs/viewtopic.php?t=1698" class="postlink">if you post anything people will read it</a>") and asking inane questions ("<a href="http://nesdev.com/bbs/viewtopic.php?t=1676" class="postlink">lyrics for snes music</a>") amongst our existing discussions.
<br />You've also posted totally inappropriate messages in forums you have no business posting to ("<a href="http://nesdev.com/bbs/viewtopic.php?t=1694" class="postlink">ha nobosy uses this wwhat a joke.</a>") - if we wanted your opinions, we'd have asked for them.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />My vote is to ban him.
<br />The fact that he registered a mirror accond for the second time, and denied he was Donknotts, wich he is, by saying "is that his first name or his last name ?" is the best argument to ban him.
<br />Additionnaly, he posted lot of crap and little NESdev related stuff. Instead, he faked being interested in some projects involving the GB and the SNES, wich he has probably few knownledge about. He posts either crap or lies. He don't stop to apologise, but he didn't ask one SINLGE Nesdev question, and didn't make a SINGLE post longer than one line.
<br />
<br />I think he should be banned, and anyone who makes lots of crap posts nonrelated to NESdev by spamming the general stuff board with stupid one-line posts should be banned in the future, because there will be most chanches it will be the Xth reincarntation of Donknotts.

We actually try to exchange information, but although you claim to be working on NES related projects you do not discuss anything about them. You only say you are working on them.
<br />
<br />So I wonder, what exactly do you want with this place. I know there are many trouble makers, that seem to get a real kick out of annoying users of random boards, and, so far, that's what you seem to be.
<br />
<br />Can you prove us wrong?

<br />Oh, and claiming you can't make a website is <strong>not</strong> a valid excuse -  there are plenty of free places that will let you at least <strong>temporarily</strong> post something, and you said you made one before so you should know how to do it.
