	<tr>
		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Despite your comments about CA65 being either &quot;wrong&quot; or &quot;having since been addressed/fixed&quot;, I'm in agreement with you about the annoyance factor (based on your description).  I had no idea about the forward reference annoyance -- that would piss me off to no end.  I've tried using ca65 so many times over only to find that I often spent more time fighting with the tools than actually getting shit done.  In fact, I find most tools today are like that -- you'll spend hours inside of a GUI &quot;messing about&quot; rather than writing the damn code, or &quot;trying to get the tools to do what you want&quot;.<br /><br />So that said, kudos to you to writing an assembler that does what you want and how you want.<br /><br />I do not want to turn this topic/thread into an assembler debate (here we go again -- tepples, if you want to split this off into another thread, be my guest), but... Still to this day I do not understand why on bare-metal platforms where assembly is used (i.e. most retro consoles, Apple II, etc.) people bother with all this unnecessary crap (ex. &quot;segments&quot; when there is absolutely no ld.so or equivalent, &quot;procedure defines&quot;, concept of scope, and other such things).  It's not like any of these things inhibit foot-shooting -- if there's a bug in your underlying 6502 that stomps all over ZP, the assembler isn't going to know that thus keep you from hurting yourself.  As someone who has done 65xxx since 1987 or so, I've never, ever understood what these offer purely from a native processor/6502 functionality standpoint.  You're writing assembly on bare metal, not C; there is no RTL, libc, or ld.so (since we're talking about segments here ;-) ).<br /><br />Honestly, I think it gives the *impression* of &quot;clean code&quot; when in reality there's functionally no difference (and I would argue no advantage).  Splitting things up into separate include files + writing proper comments is honestly all I've ever seen needed, and that's even on gigantic/huge projects (such as major tools on the Apple IIGS written purely in assembly).<br /><br />I have a completely different stance when it comes to non-bare-metal environments (i.e. present-day OSes) where C is often involved or where there is an abstraction layer (that should be used to ensure stability given the complex nature of the environment) between you and the underlying CPU.  Same goes for scripting languages, including things like perl.  So I understand the advantage, just not on bare-metal platforms.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />CA65 is not a standalone assembler, it is part of the C toolchain. It is not targeted to any particular platform either, just 6502 CPU. The segments allow to make up any memory model you need to get output you need. It case with the NES this probably could be useful since the hardware could vary from game to game - banks, their sizes and placements, extra RAM, etc.<br /><br />I personally tried all three assemblers popular in NES development - NEASM, CA65, Asm6, and had no major problems with any of these. I also used DASM for some C64 development, and recall it be less convenient that any of these.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I'd say this is on topic. I created the topic to discuss the devblog, and we're discussing it's content <img src="./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /><br /><br />I like lexical scoping because it allows me to type less. Rather than doing something like kernel_nmihandler_hadnmi, I can just say hadnmi. And when referring to it from another module, I can say kernel.nmihandler.hadnmi. But you are correct that it adds no value to the assembled binary, and actually introduces some complexity for the programmer.<br /><br />&quot;proceedures&quot; are just cosmetic. The .proc directive is aliased to .scope, and every scope defines a label (if it's inside of a segment). Originally I had intended to do some sort of static call chain analysis, but later realized that was kinda dumb for an assembler <img src="./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /><br /><br />I use segmentation for RAM as a way to allow easily relocatable libraries. I got the idea when looking at FamiTone, which wanted RAM in the $0300 page. I thought it'd be nicer to be able to write a library that just expected a RAM segment called &quot;ft_ram&quot; or something, then let the developer define where it was. I use segmentation for ROM as a way to manage physical banks.<br /><br />Anyhow I'm no longer trying to get people to adopt the assembler for use. I suppose too many assemblers muddies up the waters. Also it's not being developed with everyone in mind, really just my own needs. But if someone thinks their needs are similar to mine and would like to use it, it's open source and very well documented.<br /><br />Hopefully this week I'll be able to show you all more than just a title screen, but it's not looking too good. This week is going to be crazy busy with work as my team is piloting our product and there's a lot of operational cost at steak for the business. I'll basically be working non-stop for the next 48 to 72 hours, breaking only for sleep, food and occasional forum posting <img src="./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" />
