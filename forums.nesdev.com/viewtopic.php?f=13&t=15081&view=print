I'm guessing there isn't any contact info posted anywhere in the process on how to get assistance on creating an account which can make getting help challenging..<br /><br />Here's what was messaged to me, I'll link them to this thread so they can see someone's suggestion here and allow them to create their account.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">every time I click on Register, I'm taken to ToS page (accept/decline) then once accepted, I'm taken back to Login with an error stating that I need to log in in order to access control panel, which I can't without creating user/password.</div>

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Ah, everything works great until it doesn't.<br /><br />I had changed how the user account registration works, but it looks like the problem must have started when I changed it back to the original setting.  It wasn't anything fancy or custom in any way, just selecting a different option in the admin control panel.  So I don't know what the hell is going on.  I tried purging the cached files, no change.  This is weird.  I'd understand it breaking if we had installed a mod or something, but changing a basic option in the control panel?  I don't get it.<br /><br />Guess I'll have to put in a support request on the phpBB forum.

I put in the request, we'll see if anyone knows.<br /><br />If it's not fixable soon, it's such a weird problem that it might be best to try setting up a test server and see how a migration would go.  Kind of a pain, but not having new registrations is an intolerable problem.  We usually have about 1 registration per day, hopefully these folks will stick around while this is being resolved.
