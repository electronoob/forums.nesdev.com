Dr. Mario and the banking code seems pretty easy to follow.  I think, I don't know for sure, that the the PRG code probably has $C000 fixed which from my understanding from the wiki makes it easier to convert.  The CHR part I'm not as sure about.  The graphics stuff never seems to get through to me.

<br />
<br />There was two prototypes for Dr. Mario, known by the name Virus for unknown reasons, those are the two revisions that still exist so far!
<br />
<br />One has MMC1 and one has NROM, a person at NintendoAge most possibly still owns both after buying them from Ebay, they are not dumped yet. (according to Lost Levels Forums), But I do not know who.
<br />
<br />That is a reason why it uses only a single 32k bank (or 2 16k banks) and 4 times the CHR amount the original source proto (NROM) has

<br />
<br />See that is the kind of stuff that doesn't sink with me.  Duplicating Tiles.  I don't know why it shouldn't be that hard.

<br />Both Tetris and Dr. Mario could probably have been done in CNROM. (In fact, Tengen's pirate-original Tet&#1103;is is CNROM.) Perhaps Nintendo had excess MMC1 inventory as more developers were switching to MMC3 for its scanline counter, fine CHR ROM bankswitching, and DPCM bankswitching.
