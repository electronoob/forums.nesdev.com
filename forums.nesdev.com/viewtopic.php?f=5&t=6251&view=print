<br />
<br />What is the competition cart? The cart includes a two level demo of the final game coming this summer, one of the final boss battles against the evil Ant Queen, a scored survival/competition mode in a runaway mine cart hurtling through a collapsing mine, and volleyball mini game called Volleyfish. Each cart is numbered on a printed label. The sooner you order, the lower your number.

<br />When my video card hated me, I bought a Philips DVD recorder. It records at 30 frames per second, but if I deinterlace it right, I recover the original 60-field 240p signal.

<br />
<br />It's a bit more then a demo, really. I won't argue with you if you're not interested, but the competition cart stands on it's own merits.
<br />
<br />The main focus of the cart is a mine cart survival mode. You're in a collapsing mine trying to escape. You need to dodge falling rocks and duck under stalactites for as long as you can. The longer you survive the more points you earn, but also the faster the rocks start falling. It's a mini-game based on one of the levels from Bio Force Ape. Once you die, you're given a score and one of 10 unique quotes.
<br />
<br />Another mode is a volleyball game we're calling Volleyfish. It's you versus the butter monster in a best of 3 competition. The fish uses realistic physics with acceleration and gravity. This is something of a demo for our next project.
<br />
<br />The competition cart also happens to include a 2 level demo from Bio Force Ape. Physics, collision detection, and enemy AI have all been completely rewritten since the demo rom we put out last year. The second level finally lets you try out the Bio Force Attack, a fart attack so powerful it breaks the NES graphics down to their binary code.
<br />
<br />At the end of the 2 level demo we included the boss battle from the 7th level of Bio Force Ape. That should give you an idea of how long the final game is going to be. Here you get to fight the ant queen in her subterainian lair.
<br />
<br />After the ant queen fight, we roll the ending credits and you get to see the only animated cut scene between either game. With our engine, running animation during a cut scene takes up an awful lot of code. The competition cart's ending credits were the perfect place to use it.
<br />
<br />So while the competition cart has a demo in it, I'd hardly call it "just a demo". Copies of the black limited edition cart we were selling at the Midwest Gaming Classic last weekend are already selling for $80 at auction. I think $35 is a fair price for the content.

<br />
<br />Then i bow to your <a href="http://nesdev.com/bbs/viewtopic.php?p=46192" class="postlink">much superior</a> programming skills.
<br />
<br />I wasn't aware this was a competition to see who could write a better game. I didn't really think that was the point of this place. I have a fun, scrolling mine cart survival mode that was created at the request of the organizers of the Midwest Gaming Classic. I've been asked to run the same contest a the Classic Gaming Expo in Vegas later this year. Those are the two largest classic gaming conventions in the world, so I'm fairly honored.
<br />
<br />I'm rather pleased that 54 people entered the competition that was run off of this cart. The reviews were all positive, and people enjoyed themselves. Really, that's all I'm looking to get out of a game.
<br />
<br />When people start making games for the NES and long time developers are comparing them to graphing calculators, it's not hard to see why you have trouble attracting new members...

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Whoa, don't need to take the offensive here.
<br />Yes, I did make some throwaway techdemo, completely unaware of your project.  I just wanted to see an indexed-color version of the butter monster, and it took a while to clean up the pixels after converting it from JPEG to NES graphics.
<br />
<br />I played a lot of TI83 homebrew games years ago when I was in highschool.  Some of them were simple tunnel 'dodge the walls' games, or dodge the randomly falling/rising projectiles games.  I just got really bored of them really fast.  Then I saw Denine did "Dizzy Rainy Day", and was disappointed to see an avalanche clone.
<br />Just looked at your screenshot, looks different enough than avalanche.  So I apologize for the accusation.
<br />
<br />TI83 homebrew is basically the same as NES homebrew, except the TI83 is a lot simpler to program for, since it's framebuffer based.  Both are programmed in ASM.  Just it's Z80 instead of 6502.
<br />I abandoned the TI83 because the slow LCD screen was crap to make fast scrolling games on.

<br />
<br />And i apologize, i must have taken the TI83 comparison the wrong way. I never did much with the calculator beyond using the built in basic interpreter.

<br />Yeah, the mine cart level is scrolling. Everything else is one screen at a time.
