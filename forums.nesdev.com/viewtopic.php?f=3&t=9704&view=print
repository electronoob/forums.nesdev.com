		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Hi all, <br /><br />I know most emulators have incorporated the cheat code function, game genie, etc but i have been looking for a way to launch game genie games for nes in emulators another way and figured id ask here. <br /><br />I use nestopia as my weapon of choice and currently there is no way to launch game genie codes &quot;natively&quot; or so to speak. What i mean by this is you cannot go to the game genie screen, type in the codes and load the game like the way we used to do it. SO my question is, is there any way to take the bios rom for game genie, somehow ips patch it to an nes rom and have where you can put in the codes, hit start and then play?<br /><br />I know most people dont care too much for it this way, but i would like to try to figure out something, its always fun to fire up super mario brothers, input some random cheats  hit start and see what happens. <br /><br />Anyways takes the time for reading this and hopefully an expert or someone with more knowlege can chime in and see if this doable. I was thinking being able to code the emu to do it would be too much work and im not a coder by any means but somehow being able to &quot;patch&quot; it onto nes roms sounds more doable. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />

Going your route is much more complex, while modding the source is probably really easy once you make the UI and functionality of adding codes.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Nestopia is probably the hardest emulator to add it to, due to the level of abstraction it uses. An emulator that people hack on a lot seems a better choice. I wonder whether FCEU is a good candidate, given all the variants I've heard about.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Thanks for all the responses guys!  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_surprised.gif" alt=":o" title="Surprised" /> <br /><br />I currently play only the iterations of nestopia on pc and nestopia for xbox. I might give it a go myself and see if i can add it in. Don't know how hard it will be but will try to do it. Maybe add support like the way it looks for  disksys.rom for fds games, have it where it looks for gg.rom or something, then add an option into the menu to turn it on and off perhaps like &quot;Run game genie natively&quot; yes, no or something.<br /><br />I have very limited experience with coding but some skill, definitely up for a good challenge. The hard part for me is tying them together, nestopia already emulates the rom, so i guess it is a matter of tying the emu into loading the game genie rom first, then the game when the option is enabled, correct?

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Two basic ways to emulate it:<br /><br />Run the GG ROM and when it does the write to switch to the game ROM, save the GG patch chip register writes, load the actual game ROM, then decode the patch chip writes into GG codes that the emulator uses, and run the game as if the user entered them using the emulator's usual UI.<br /><br />The more accurate way is to load the game ROM and GG ROM, and have the GG mapper piggyback on whatever normal mapper the ROM uses, and emulate it all exactly how the GG does. This might be more involved, as the emulator probably doesn't support <em>two</em> mappers active simultaneously.<br /><br />But given that at least two emulators already support it, why not just use one of them?

And I haven't checked how much CPU is needed for puNES; Nestopia ran on an old 866 MHz P3, and even on newer machines other than Atom, less CPU use means less heat.<br /><br />(Side note: blargg, where's your NTSC library hosted now?)

Sounds like for me i should go the easy route at first. <br /><br />I think genesis plus gx has a way where you put the bios for the game genie rom into a bios folder and then selecting an option in the menu where you choose to turn the native gg emulation on, then pick a rom to run and it automatically takes you to the game after putting in your codes and hitting start. <br /><br />Anyone have any pointers as to where i should start?
