The idea was stop people from importing USA TVs (which was common at the time) and when VHS VCRs appeared in the early 80s people also imported a LOT of these. I had a National NV-G9 VCR which had to be modified to work with PAL-M. There were specialized shops on that kind of service.<br /><br />I never understood why the government did not use that on their favour instead.

This is not really related, but I think they are right, at least ideologically. People importing so many un-necessary stuff from contries far away of their living place is a major source of pollution and ecological disaster. It can also hurt the local economy if they are in concurrence.<br /><br />It becomes hard to buy something that didn't already did the world tour several times and this is getting so ridiculous.<br /><br />Of course in the case you actually need something that you cannot get anywhere else, then this is a problem.<br /><br />In regard of what you say, I think adoption of the PAL-M standard was probably done in the 60s or maybe early 70s, at least 30 years before ebay came.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=38">Bregalad</a> — Wed Aug 27, 2014 9:40 am</p><hr />

I'm no expert, but even if 220 V is often used in PAL countries and 110 V in NTSC countries, I don't think this is a golden rule. Some countries like Brazil even use a 60Hz variation of PAL apparently. Since you mentioned that, I just wanted to make sure you don't mix those. If you switch your TV for NTSC, you should make sure it doesn't expect the supply to be 110V. If it expect 110V and recieve twice as much, I don't know what will happen but this certainly won't be good !<br /><br />While today for low power it's possible to make entirely electronics based supplies that auto-adapt between various AC voltages, this wasn't the case 50 years ago, so if such a switch exists, it probably just change something mechanically in a transformer to change the voltage ratio. So if the same switch change both the colour decoding and the power supply it should be manageable to mod it so it only change the colour decoding and not the supply.<br /><br />Another potential issue when importing a NTSC console in PAL land is how it will be connected to the TV. If you are going to use AV, there won't be any problem. If you are using RF however you'll have issues. When I tried connecting an imported USA NES to a modern PAL TV that also accepts NTSC by RF, the image worked, but I had very loud white noise in sound. I could hear the real sound very quietly below the noise, but it was basically unusable. I made a thread about this fact back then, pehaps you can find it with the search function ? (yes I'm that lazy)<br /><br />So basically you should either import the regular USA frontloader, or the japanese AV revision of the famicom if you want an authentic NTSC console and AV output. USA Toploaders or the original japanese famicom only have RF output, but you can mod them to get AV (that's what I did with my USA top loader).<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=38">Bregalad</a> — Wed Aug 20, 2014 9:37 am</p><hr />

Hello, everyone. I think this place should be right for me to ask these questions.<br />1. I have a television bought before fifteen years ago. This television can be switched between PAL and NTSC. In our country, we use PAL to watch TV(Power supply voltage is 220 ​​volts). Can I use this television to run a real NTSC NES console? If not, could you recommend to me another to run a real NTSC NES console(brand and detailed type)? If OKay, then please see next question, else see question 3.<br />2. Where can I buy a real NTSC NES console(not famiclones)?<br />3. I want a device which can be loaded a program. And the device can be runned on the real NTSC/PAL NES. In order to build that device, what do I need? Now, I have a computer only.<br />4. Where can I buy a MMC3 cartridge, for example, double dragon 2? I want to see why my MMC3 emulation is wrong.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=6322">Boolean</a> — Wed Aug 20, 2014 7:19 am</p><hr />
