Primary colors can be used as a nice ramp between separate color ranges.<br />At least, that's what I've used them for.<br /><br />(...I can't seem to find the palette I had figured out, from 2 years ago. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_neutral.gif" alt=":|" title="Neutral" />)<br /><br />If you're serious about figuring things out, try for all 4 primaries: red, blue, green, yellow.

I'm not talking about making a color ramp between primary colors.  I'm talking about shadow/highlight gradients of a primary color.  It tends to look better if the middle shade is slightly darker or lighter than the fully saturated color.  From my experience, secondary colors like orange and blue-violet are easier to fully saturate without looking weird in a shadow/highlight ramp.

I have a crappy Emerson LCD TV in my room and a nice Phillips flat screen CRT TV that I brought out for a party, and the old TV beats the crap out of the newer one. It was much more vibrant and didn't distort at different angles, looked less blurry, had no lag, and had much better sound (like I said, it's a higher quality TV even if older). I don't know why I felt like sharing that, but I don't think this thread is really going anywhere anyway. I just always hate people saying that you should hook up old technology to newer TVs and stuff. The way I see it, you use SD technology on SD TVs, and HD technology on HD TVs. One thing I never really thought of is that I imagine 720p video would look cleaner on a 720p TV than 1080p or something like that. Another thing I also wondered is did somebody say that even if an HD TV is receiving HD signal, it will still lag?

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />An HDTV receiving a 1080i signal, such as broadcast or cable TV, is likely to lag to deinterlace it. It may lag even when receiving a progressive signal in order to run various enhancement filters on the image, but better TVs have a &quot;game mode&quot; option to turn enhancement down to minimum.<br /><br />Among LCDs, IPS is more consistent than TN at different viewing angles. This is why smartphones and tablet computers are more likely to use IPS, as a portrait-oriented tablet will have the user's two eyes at significantly different viewing angles.<br /><br />The problem with using old TVs with old consoles is twofold. For one thing, old TVs are less likely to fit in a cramped apartment. For another, old TVs wear out. My 27&quot; Magnavox died, and now I'm back on a 13&quot; Panasonic.

Since then, I also salvaged a 14&quot; CCE (which's a traditionally crappy brazilian brand), just in case.

My 27&quot; Magnavox died, and now I'm back on a 13&quot; Panasonic.</div><br />This is the biggest problem in my opinion. Fixing a nearly (or over!) three decades old console with dead discrete components is easy, and the custom ones are unlikely to die (probably will outlast us, even). Good luck managing to fix an old CRT TV though, especially since the things most prone to fail are those involved with the tube.<br /><br />Now, really most of the shit that gets in the way in modern TVs could be fixed because it's mostly a limitation of their programming. But that's not gonna happen as long as there isn't a good business reason for that. Maybe if in the future somebody decides to release a niche &quot;retro TV&quot; designed specifically to cope with those old quirky analog signals.

I don't have any faith in TV manufactures ever improving analog video support. Quite the opposite really, I expect them to completely get rid of analog inputs soon. Our best bet will likely be standalone converters created by hardware people that are part of the retro scene.
