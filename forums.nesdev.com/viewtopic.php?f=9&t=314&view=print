		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I've been attempting to make a custom game and run it on my NES. I started with a Gyromite cart, removed the PRG and CHR PROMs, added bridges in their place, and popped in my own burned PRG and CHR EPROMs. All I get, however, is a solid grey screen (no blinking).
<br />
<br />My NES absoloutely works, and I tested this board specifically before I modded it and it played fine. The board was not damaged at all during the removal of the original PROMs.
<br />
<br />My code runs fine in FCEU. I tried splitting it into CHR and PRG manually and with a utility, and they produced the same result.
<br />
<br />I then tried burning Gyromite back on to my EPROMs, and again, I was greeted with the same solid grey screen.
<br />
<br />Any ideas what might be going on?

<br />
<br />I'm not sure what's wrong, with NROM there's not much that can mess up.  Seems like it would have to be a ROM splitting or electrical issue (open or short on a pin?), sounds like you've ruled out the ROM split already though.

<br />
<br />If you have a 32kB EPROM, perhaps you could try copying your PRG into it twice and burning that.  I remember there's a couple different NROM board types though, NROM-128 and NROM-256, I can't recall what the differences were exactly (maybe search the forum if you want to).

<br />You mentioned that $80xx might be a bad location?

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Yeah, just doubling up the PRG is what I meant.
<br />
<br />Starting at $8xxx is generally fine for 16kB games, I've seen some games (I think Lunar Pool was one) that do exactly that.
<br />
<br />So yeah, I'm a bit mystified about why your cart isn't working.  Doubling up the PRG really shouldn't fix Gyromite, it should work already like you suspected.
<br />
<br />If you're new to soldering stuff, make sure the rom socket is joined to the board properly (using a multimeter or just up-close visual inspection).

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Yeah, the board looks clean, just from a visual inspection. Taking out the original PROMs was pretty involved, and I ruined a bunch of boards before finally getting this one right, which made it twice as frustrating when this board turned out not to work, either. Unfortunately I don't have a multimeter to test with.
<br />
<br />One other thing, as I trying to get the cart into the correct vertical position, I noticed a few stray tiles appeared on the screen for a moment, but I couldn't get them back. I could have been random, but I doubt it..
<br />
<br />Can you provide me with any more info about "doubleing up"? An example, maybe?

<br />There's still an inssue, though, in that it will display the a weird glitched out version of what I should see (it's a single screen), and only when I press reset, but at least this rules out the board not working!
<br />
<br />Thanks so much!

When you say you "bridged" the chips, I'm assuming you connected pin 1 to pin 1, pin 2 to pin 2 etc.  There are a couple of pins that don't match on most EEPROMS, so you have to re-route a bit.  What is the part number of the EEPROMS you have?

<br />
<br />However, CHR uses 8kB ROM (which would be a 27C64 EPROM, but it's possibly not worth getting those because they're older/rarer).  So I think I realize the CHR problem now, maybe you burned CHR into the lower 8kB then the NES is probably displaying the upper 8kB.  So try duplicating the CHR.
<br />
<br />Like "copy /b file.chr+file.chr+file.chr+file.chr file2.chr"
