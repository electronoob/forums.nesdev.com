But I'm fine either way, so long as both have version numbers, dates, or other identifying marks.

After listening to it all I took some time to look at the areas mentioned and to contemplate the issues given. The changes I've made probably wont make it too much easier but I do hope it helps provide a somewhat more balanced and better experience. <br /><br />Also, would anyone be interested in a cheat for more time?

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Ack, got logged out when replying. Short version follows:<br /><br />It's still great, but I didn't notice much of a change in the difficulty?  <br /><br />On the level with 2 flowers, 2 red fishes, and rain, i feel like one too much element is introduced at the same time which is quite the difficulty gap compared to earlier stages. Maybe remove one of the fishes? Maybe remove the rain? Or increase the flower countdowns. Or make the flowers use the same timer (ie if the second flower is eaten, the first will synchronize, that is, restart the countdown, since it was overwritten by the second flower munch). Just some options. <br /><br />I think it is a good rule of thumb to not measure against ones' own skill. Game devs quickly become experts on their own game, while new players don't have that chance. <br /><br />Maybe you can ask someone who hasn't already played it to record a play session (fceux offer input-scripting &quot;movies&quot; which are lightweight).

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Thank you for all the input and suggestions, I'll mull over it for a while and have a thorough look at stage 1-9.<br /> <br />Many of the changes balanced out the difficulty in the second world. Though the damage reduction does affect the entire game, it mostly adds an extra hit.<br /><br />I understand and have tried not to measure to my own skills but even with that said it's still hard to get it right. I've lowered the difficulty greatly compared to what it once was and I'm glad I did that. I just become attached to parts of the game while developing it whether it be bad or good and find it difficult to let it go. Though that is something I need to learn much more readily.<br /><br />As you've suggested though, I really do need to watch other people play the game. The problem with simply removing/changing enemies is that doesn't necessarily fix the main problem causing it too difficult. Sure, removing some enemies will make it easier but if there is another problem that is the cause it could manifest itself later on in the game for those players. Such as not showing how certain mechanics works clearly enough. I don't want to simply shift their frustration to another stage, I want to fix it if possible. Though, even with that thought, there is only so much I can do with the way the game plays but I will try my hardest to find a solution.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />This game could certainly use an easy mode. After watching some people play it I've noticed that many players have difficulty with the movement alone, which only becomes worse with the added effects of the weather. I don't believe there is anything I can do to help alleviate these issues other than removing the weather completely but I feel that would compromise the quality of the game and I would rather avoid that. But anyway...<br /><br /><em><strong>Easy mode</strong></em> is here! (v1.2)<br />It took me a bit of time to implement it but hopefully it will enable more people to enjoy <em>Nim &amp; Nom</em>.<br /><br />This will mark the last update for <em>Nim &amp; Nom</em> barring a significant bug I didn't find while working on this update. After working on it for so long I've found it to be such a relief to have it finished, knowing I can now put all my efforts towards new projects. Though I will admit I did find myself having fun while working on these updates and will miss it. Anyway, Enjoy!

I'm doing that now.<br /><br />I have a small question: how are you compiling this? I see it is nesasm3 but I would have trouble figuring out the command paramenters, so a batch file would be appreciated ^^<br />edit: okay, got it. couldn't be simpler. For anyone wondering, create a nesasm3 folder, have nesasm3.exe there and nim_nom as a sub folder, then just have a batch file inside the nim_nom folder:<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">cd..<br />nesasm3 &quot;nim_nom\nim &amp; nom.asm&quot;</div><br />(windows)
