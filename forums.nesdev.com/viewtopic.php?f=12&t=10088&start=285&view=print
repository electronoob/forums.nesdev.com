If you fail to wait long enough it won't erase or program as you want it to. <br /><br />If you're having trouble getting the boards recognized you might just not have them seated in the connector correctly. It's not a perfect connector. I think it needs the pcb all the way to one side. And I assume you don't have them in a cartridge case while trying to program them right? They won't fit in right if you have them cased I believe. <br /><br />Programming the firmware shouln't be a big deal. I think you just set the switch to the BL/Boot Loader position before plugging it in. Then you run the right batch file to upload the firmware. When it's done you push that switch out of the boot loader position, or else the next time it boots up it'll again be in boot loader mode. <br /><br />After I program the firmware I change the switch from BL to Run (I think it's called run) then unplug it or hit the reset button.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Thanks a lot for the advice, but unfortunately I've done several writing processes before. I helped Danin test the software and new firmware upgrades before he released them and generally anything he needed me to write. I have 6 boards left over from the several that I bought, and know how to seat them... I wish it was that simple.<br /><br />In a nutshell, I really appreciate the help but not putting it in right isn't the problem <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /> I'm sadly leaning to the conclusion that both my kazoos are dead now for some reason?<br /><br />EDIT: After an alcohol bath and some serious cleaning, it seems to work again. I had it stored in a sealed box, but somehow something must have gotten in it. At any rate, at least it works again ^_^ Thanks Danin!

A few others have had my problems too and I found a solution that I wanted to share incase anyone else comes here for it:<br /><br />The issue with the games suddenly stopping and getting a black screen have been resolved with a very simple trick: Put them in a game genie and run it like that. I have no idea why this works, but it does. All the games I had issues with suddenly started working correctly after this. I hope this helps anyone who had this problem as well!<br /><br />Another note, I ran into a new problem that is making me scratch my head again. For some reason, a few games won't boot up when I write them to my board. Strangely enough, its some that used to work. Final Fantasy VI/III, Lennus II, and now the BS-Zelda real hardware patch. It writes fine, no errors, the Lo/Hi rom is in the right place.... Just gives a black screen when it's turned on in the console. Anyone have this problem before?

I have no problem writing it to a 8mb board but I have none left.<br />How do I place the rom?  I have tried heaps of combinations including doubling the rom, splitting it and putting the last 2mb at the start etc.  <br />I have special firmware someone game me on Nintendo Age including the 12-16mb Erase file which works perfect for Star Ocean.<br />I am using the original software as I have not had much luck using the Retro-Prog.<br />Any advice on this one?<br />Thanks

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />From what I understand, INL programs those boards differently to handle the 96Mbit rom space. I don't know if they are really compatible with a regular game without some data rearranging... But I believe it's split into 3 32Mbit chunks.<br /><br />Maybe it's similar to how his 8MB boards work, by cutting the last 16Mbit of the rom space and doubling it up in the beginning of the rom using a hex editor. I remember having to do that with some games to get them to work. Maybe the 12MB board is the same?
