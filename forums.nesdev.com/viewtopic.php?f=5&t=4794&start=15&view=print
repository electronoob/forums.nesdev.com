<br />Oh my this is so true. The grammar is incredibly simple in english and that's probably the reason it's the only foregin language I was able to learn correctly. Just add a 's' for plural and just add a 's' when you use 'he/she' and that's about all. In every other language (including french) it was so complicated I didn't understand anything. But for french I'm used to it so I make it correct without understanding why.
<br />
<br />The english pronunciation is just plain terrible. If I went to some country where people speaks english nobody would understnad what I say and I woudln't understand andybody, I'd have to write everything and ask them to write everything. Altough I can still make sense when someone talks with plain good birtish accent, if there is any american or scotish accent I can't make any sense. The very worse is Irish accent, in fact I couldn't even belive it was actually english they speak.

<br />
<br />Yeah, sometimes I can't even understand English in an Irish accent  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /> .
<br />
<br />English pronunciation makes basically no sense. Trying to put rules on it is just plain stupid. Every word is pronounced the way it is just because. Some words share similar spelling and pronunciation, but this really makes no "law" to which words must abide in their spelling and pronunciation.
<br />
<br />MetalSlime linked me to an article back there that was really interesting. It basically stated that one should not learn grammar while learning a language. It said that learning a language and learning <em>about</em> a language should be separated, and one should only study grammar <em>in</em> the language being studied. So I should not study Japanese grammar in English, but in Japanese. This is a very smart approach I think because well I understand English perfectly, and I have no idea about the rules for the most part, I don't need to. That's because I learned the language before learning about any of the rules. I really think learning a language the way you learned it when you were like 2 is the best way, because in the end you understand it better, without needing to memorize stupid rules.

<br />One problem with fully embracing this method is that laws are keyed to chronological age, not cultural age. If one is chronologically 32 but acts 2, he might get arrested.

For example, it's hard to find someone who understands Japanese to read children's stories to you, sitting there teaching you the language full time, correcting your mistakes understanding that you don't fully understand the language (like one's mother or father).
<br />
<br />The circumstances one lives under at the age of two and thirty are completely different, and sadly the one at thirty makes it far more difficult to learn a new language because you have other engagements which take up all of your time.

<br />Yeah, I learned how to read it in preschool but still...
<br />All these synonyms and antonyms and the way it's assembled. It's very ugly.
<br />And I hate crap such as "Wind" and "Wind" Which would be bad in movie titles because you really wouldn't know the difference unless it said something like "Blowing wind" or "Wind up toy" Especially how people pronounce things and the variations of spelling that mean the same thing and stuff.
<br />Japanese is allot more simplistic to me, Although they have many variations and styles, I have no need for it so I'll drop it.
<br />
<br />I've learned several languages, forgot most of them though due to lack of usage. 
<br />
<br />The point is 'English is a crappy Latin ripoff that is hybrid with other stuff."
<br />Everyone should just talk in C++. Conversations would be long but at least they'd make more sense.
<br />
<br />
<br />Edit: See, my mind has so many variations while I compile these sentences that it's becoming garbled and senseless to most people. 
<br />
<br />If my brain had an english partition I'd format and reinstall. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_lol.gif" alt=":lol:" title="Laughing" />

<br />I never tought about that, but you are probably right. Altough if you go to a country to get some job or make some studies in some foregin language, and have friends that are from the said country and that are talking to you in that language and correct you when you are wrong, it's a good start. But you'll continue to think in your mother language, but when you are 2 you probably don't think in any language before thinking in your mother language.
<br />
<br />In what language you think is very important. I think about stuff mostly in french, but for example when I write that I think it in english directly, I do not think in french then translate it. It helps really a lot and is more faster and more reliable to directly think in the foregin language, but you have to already know some words and some grammar in order to do so.

<br />That's largely because of a big change called the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Vowel_Shift" class="postlink">Great Vowel Shift</a>.  It helped make English pronunciation quite a bit [more] counterintuitive.
<br />
<br />Regarding "it's/its" and <strong>'s</strong>, it's always bugged me when people got this wrong... a little trivia: the <strong>'s</strong> is a contraction of "his" (or "es" in old(?) English)... so in some old texts, "John's wagon" was written as "John his wagon", for example.
