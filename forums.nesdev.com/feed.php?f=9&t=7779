If it was a one off and you're on the NES no.   Keep in mind retrozone doesn't have FC boards.  For someone like FARID whose etching his  own boards, working on the FC, and has to deal with international shipping I would say yes.  Not only that but it would be of a great use for his multicarts, being able putting all the added rom switching logic he's designed on the CPLD along with the MMC1.  <br /><br />Really the versatility is unmatched and is what would allow for prices to be lowered.  You would be able to  design a mapper generic board to be made in larger quantities on the cheap.  Which is what got bunnyboy his prices his MMC1 CPLD (XC9572-15PCG44C) goes from $5.25 at single quantities to $3.85 each for 100 on Digikey anyways.  <br /><br />This all comes at the additinal cost of learning how to use CPLDs however which isn't something that's very user friendly at the moment especially for the nesdev community.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=4832">infiniteneslives</a> — Fri Sep 02, 2011 5:36 pm</p><hr />

Honestly if those clones will work for you they would be the easiest to work with and the better option.  They aren't just simple chips like your used to.  But basically you can design up your logic schematics on the computer or code the logic in a hardware description language (HDL) like Verilog or VHDL.  Then you program you're "circuit" onto the CPLD via a USB programmer and now the CPLD is configured for whatever you designed it to be.  Not sure if it helps but here's a basic video of a guy using a Lattice CPLD.  I'd probably recommend Xilinx or Altera though.<br /><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtmVZwZNrM&amp;feature=related" class="postlink">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtmVZwZNrM&amp;feature=related</a><br /><br />The basic idea is to reverse engineer the MMC1 and then program it's onto a CPLD.  Something as simple as the MMC1 should fit on a CPLD that only costs a few bucks.  If you're completely unfamiliar you'd have to do some research about them and perhaps find a dev board to learn on and play around with.  This is one of the main goals of the NESDEV1 cart I'm working on right now.  To provide a CPLD on a cart that's already set up for you.  Then people on here could play around with it and perhaps create a library for ourselves of mappers.  Then making it easier to design things like your multicarts that only need one chip for the mapper rom selector and everything.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=4832">infiniteneslives</a> — Thu Sep 01, 2011 9:31 pm</p><hr />

A MMC1 clone wouldn't be cost effective at all when you take the PCB into account... It would be far less work to rework a few signals on a licensed game or find a bootleg. To top it off, in very small quantities few people would say the sacrifice is morally reprehensible; personally I only have a problem with it when people sacrifice games for profit in "repros".<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=20">kyuusaku</a> — Thu Sep 01, 2011 3:37 pm</p><hr />
