		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I worked on timer support yesterday. Timers allow you to count and display CPU cycles between two blocks. Currently it's implemented using special registers: $401E/$401F control timer 0 (VirtuaNES compatible) and $402x/$403x control 16 additional timers.
<br />
<br />I might change it to use specially named symbols instead. So you'd define a symbol named timer1_start/timer1_end or something. Currently it can't be made to work properly with bank switching though. Also a symbol could be exported to define a name for a timer. Or the names could be read from text file... or entered in the debugger. I'm not sure what would be the best way.
<br />
<br />Now if Uz only would implement those damn line infos for .repeat blocks and macros in CC65... I would be one happy camper. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />
<br />
<br />Also note to self: need to fork Nintendulator from SourceForge SVN instead of working on a static copy.

<br />I know what you mean, when you're used to proper debugging tools there's no going back. Surprisingly many developers (all around, not just NesDev) are very ignorant about this and resort to "printf debugging" instead.

It then takes maximizing it from the task bar to get it visible at all. Selecting a size from the PPU menu will unmaximize it without making it invisible again. 
<br />
<br />I don't think I've had the problem, however, since I started using the most recent Unicode binary. I'm running 64bit Windows 7. Using the ASCII binary, Windows will switch my desktop theme saying the program doesn't support it.
<br />
<br />(For some reason, whenever I download Nintendulator, I tend to download the wrong one. I always get rather confused by the layout of the website, even though it was obviously designed to be simple.)
<br />
<br />Two other random things! It stores the palette settings (NTSC slider values) in the registry, which makes it really hard to reset if you don't remember the initial value. I deleted all the registry entries for Nintendulator, but then the palette still didn't look quite right.
<br />
<br />Also, kind of a nitpick, but the menu item that shows the "Debug Information" window should probably toggle it rather than do nothing when the window is already displayed.

<br />
<br />Printf debugging has it's place, but usually only for hard bugs where throw/catch clauses will work. For soft bugs, printf debugging is a nightmare.

Just suggesting listing files because they don't need any reassembly, just identification of addresses to line numbers, and those are already in the file.

<br />Although, embedding ASM6 into an emulator seems like it would be easy as well.
