Hopefully the bushes won't be so out-of-place when I have trees, mountains and buildings all over the place.<br /></div><br /><br />Well when you have them, try the non-black outlines again.  See if it makes a difference.<br /><br />It is easy to infer that the bushes cannot be stood on when there is little more than just bushes.  The problem becomes when you have a lot going on in the scene.  It is just generally easier to set your standards early and build within them, than to take a complex scene and try to find ways to convey things properly.  When your game grows and you have more going on in the background, identifying something by context becomes harder.<br /><br />I personally am a fan of what Mega Man games do; they keep the palettes separate between solid objects and background.  But that would not work in the scene you drew because you have one-way platforms; the hills that are both background and solid.  Unless you had more colors to work with, it is hard to use palettes to separate things when you have that kind of level design.  Four sets of three colors is a harsh master.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">Rahsennor wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">So visually I was on the right track: simple blocky shapes are interactive, complex curvy shapes are in the background. That's still not quite perfect though; look at the airships. It's a lot more complex than &quot;black outline means solid&quot;. I think the player can be trusted to infer that my two bushes are purely decorative, provided they're introduced in the right way.<br /></div><br /><br />For my opinion, I think you ought to make the bushes look more organic and rough if you are going to adhere to a rule of using shape to indicate what is solid and what is not.  That straight sides rub against the rule a bit.  Not a lot, but it might look better with rough sides anyway.<br /><br />The airships (1) never appear until far in the game when the player already has a strong grasp on things, (2) still retain solid tops and only have curved surfaces in the areas where the player isn't *really* supposed to go, and (3) are used in levels completely devoid of background.<br /><br />I heard someone once say &quot;You can only break the rules when you understand them completely.&quot;  He was referring to writing (or maybe it was art; it was at a panel at some convention) but it applies to a lot of things.  And understanding the rules also means understanding why they are there.  You need to take that into context when you try to bend around an established standard.<br />For example, the palette rule I mentioned Mega Man uses.  In Mega Man 6's Tomahawk Man stage, they break it; they have a fence that uses the same palette as the ground.  BUT the portions of those colors are so vastly different than how they are used in the ground that at first glance it almost looks like a different palette.<br />That's the same principal with how Mario 3 broke their own rules.  It was done in such a manner that they still covered their butts and adhered to the founding principles of their rules.<br />Establish your rules, but don't break them until you have them completely covered.

The player should be smart enough to determine what's the background vs what's the foreground based on what makes sense, and the background is often a little darker or smaller looking and stuff like that.<br /><br />I was actually trying to draw a waterfall, but I felt it was too difficult and I got bored and realized the only reason I was doing it in the first place is to get out of debugging my program. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_lol.gif" alt=":lol:" title="Laughing" /><br /><br />This is my half-assed attempted. As you can see, I didn't get very far at all.<br /><br /><div class="attachtitle">Attachment:</div><div class="attachcontent">

	</div><br />Honestly though, I think many people's biggest problem (including yours, Rahsennor,) is that you try and make everything way to &quot;neat&quot;, like putting dots in triangles. Half of the time, like with the tree I posted earlier and part of the waterfall I made, I just kind of randomly place down pixels. For the waterfall, (the part that I completed anyway) I literally just got a spray can spray stamp and changed the sizes and put it all over and then tweaked it afterword (like the bottom of the waterfall, I only did the top left side where I made it look more like mist). All I can say is, use your brain to try and make stuff look good, and look at pictures of the real object you're trying to draw and also look at artwork from games you think look good for ideas of how to draw what you're trying to draw.<br /><br />As I said about you trying to draw everything so ornately, I'd suggest drawing something more &quot;mechanical&quot;. In my opinion, drawing something like a waterfall is one of the hardest things you can attempt, but that's also because I'm doing it a lot differently than you. I would suggest making your waterfall a lot less &quot;neat&quot; in not using perfect patterns and also not use way to high contrast but making it very bright.<br /><br />Here's a very good picture in looking how to draw a waterfall:<br /><br /><img src="http://thumbs.dreamstime.com/x/large-waterfall-small-rainbow-8692755.jpg" alt="Image" />

Making things look like plastic is a perfectly valid aesthetical decision when it comes to pixel art, there's no need to model things after real world stuff all the time. You do need to convey the right ideas to the players though, to make it obvious what is solid and what isn't, what's harmful and what isn't, and so on.<br /><br />One thing you can do to improve the graphics is to be less stingy with the tiles. Make repetitive patterns less repetitive, create some variations of textures that you can apply randomly to otherwise boring areas (like missing rocks, mossy spots, cracks on a wall, differently colored bricks, stuff like that).

From my experience with the Windows version, you have to use the cursor the program provides. I don't mind it anymore but I remember struggling with it a bit at first.<br /><br />However, if you really want to change it, you can go to aseprite-0.9.5-win32\data\skins\default and edit sheet.png to change the cursor. The program's pretty customizable in that respect, even moreso in the newer versions.

In the end, how long you've used a program is more important than the toolset.<br /><br />So the bottom line is, Espozo, there are a lot of options out there but as long as you're using something that's meant for pixel art and supports animation (Graphics Gale, Pro Motion, Character Maker 1999, ASEprite) it will suffice.
