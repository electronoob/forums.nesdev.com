<br />Does this use sprite 0 hit test multiple times per frame? (Moving it down?)

<br />
<br />Yeah i think it's timed code. I just now got 3 parrallax scrolls by waiting for sprite 0 hit then making a tacky 'wait' function to change the scroll again.
<br />My hacky tacky KNES code:
<br />
<br />       <div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent"><br />//code at the end of a vblank<br />scroll_test&#40;&#41;; //scroll shift <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br />// &#40;sprite 0&#41;<br />while&#40;PPU.status &amp; &#40;byte&#41;_B&#40;01000000&#41;&#41;;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />// now wait for it to be set &#40;sprite 0&#41;<br />while&#40;!&#40;PPU.status &amp; &#40;byte&#41;_B&#40;01000000&#41;&#41;&#41;;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />scroll_test2&#40;&#41;; //scroll shift <br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; <br />//wait <br />j = 0;<br />while&#40;j != 200&#41;<br />&#123;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;j++;<br />&#125;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />scroll_test3&#40;&#41;;<br /><br /></div>
<br />
<br />each scroll test function writes a different horizontal scroll value to $2005. The sprite 0 hit code i used can be found in KNES's platform demo src. 
<br />
<br />The question is... can sprite 0 be hit and reset multiple times in the same vblank? If i find an answer i'll post here.

<br />Ninja Gaiden doesn't use MMC3 either (it's MMC1). So it pretty much has to use timed code. Seems to use sprite 0 hit for the determine where to start the effect, though.
<br />
<br />BTW OP, it's impossible to get multiple sprite 0 hits per frame, as 1) it's not possible to move sprites in the middle of the frame without disabling rendering 2) it's not possible to clear the sprite 0 hit flag manually, it gets cleared at the end of the vblank

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />For cutscenes and whatever other screens that are not actual gameplay you can usually get away with a sprite 0 hit for the first split and timed code for the rest. Easier than monkeying around with DMC IRQs, IMO.
<br />
<br />During gameplay things are not so simple... depending on the amount of processing needed for different parts of the levels you might miss the sprite hit (i.e. you start waiting for it after it has already happened, causing the split to happen at the wrong position), and you can't waste much CPU time with timed code.
<br />
<br />In this case, DMC IRQs help, as long as the split point is always the same, otherwise only mapper IRQs can offer a completely stable solution.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />A work around to wasting CPU time is to make fixed-time code that accomplishes something useful to your engine. This is usually hard to pull off efficiently, since routines in an engine should usually be designed to only process as much information as they need to at a time rather than a fixed amount. But still, you could in theory make use of the time rather than wasting it with NOPs.

<br />I tried this only once, and this is extremely, I mean REALLY extremely hard to do. Especially if you want to support both PAL and NTSC timings...
<br />
<br />If you have to wait a long while and have to do something that can be done in constant timing, it's ok to design the task so that it takes a constant time to be executed and then wait the remaining time which is also constant.
<br />However if you want to do special write every so many scanline and interleave some unrelated calculations between the writes, this becomes a total nightmare.

A "two-line kernel" could update the screen on one line, do some calculations on the second line, and then STA WSYNC to soak up any excess cycles.

<br />I once had an idea that it would be cool to have a special compiler that could automatically build the 6502 code to do tasks like that. You could specify the algorithm you want to run (maybe in a specialized form of 6502 assembly) and what PPU/etc registers you want to write at what times, and it would figure it all out automatically. Of course it would have some limitations, but would be way easier than trying to time everything manually.
