		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Well I haven't been very vocal about this project so far, I figure now is the time to spill the beans.<br /><br />Pretty simple SNES flash cart.  Only supports HiROM and LoROM with upper address mapping controlled by the CPLD.  It's all new parts so the flash is obviously 3.3v.  The CPLD is 5v tolerant, but drives the flash with 3.3v for A12-A22(23).  Lower address bits A0-7 and data bus are shifted via a 16x level shifter, the CPLD controls the direction of the data bus through the shifter.  Then the few address lines I didn't have room for I used a pair of 4x resistor arrays to level shift appropriately (A8-A11)<br /><br />It uses Jim's Cool CIC of the SNES flavor.  The battery backing is currently similar to NES style using schottky diodes.  I might improve upon this, but it's pretty much the simplest solution and can work very well if done properly.  If it proves to be a good solution then I'll stick with it long term.  If not, I've got some other plans.<br /><br />It supports up to TWO 8MB flash chips for 16MB total.  And it has 128KB of SRAM.  So there's quite a bit of room within the Hi-Lo ROM limitations.  The CPLD can contain both Hi &amp; Lo rom at the same time and be selectable via the solder jumper on the back to switch back and forth.  I have thoughts to configure it for reset selectable multicart form with something like 2x LoROM and 2x HiROM.<br /><br />It's designed to be programmed via the SNES edge connector. I've modified the <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/viewtopic.php?f=9&amp;t=7912" class="postlink">Kazzo</a> to support.  The side 10-pin connector is for programming the CPLD and CIC, and possibly accelerating the programming speed.  The form factor still keeps it fitting in standard original SNES cases.  I'm investigating some options to get new SNES cases made up to go along with them. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />The flash is 90nsec so it should support fast-rom without much trouble.<br /><br />Right now I'm pretty close to having it working.  Got some bugs/kinks to work out as right now only ~90% of the bytes are actually getting programmed on the flash.  DKC will actually boot though, has some graphics glitching and then crashes randomly in the title scene.  Hoping to have it up and running 100% and order the first batch of boards this month.<br /><br />I haven't settled on the price yet, it will depend on how much it costs me to have them assembled.  My current target is ~$20 for a 8MB version fully assembled.  The kazzo is around the same price, so it should make for a simple dev/flash cart setup for under $50.<br /><br />I'd like to give a special thanks to nocash for his <a href="http://nocash.emubase.de/fullsnes.htm" class="postlink">spectacular documentation</a> on the SNES and it's hardware.  Because of that I was able to figure out everything I needed without reverse engineering it all for myself.<br /><br /><br /><img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/18341918/SNES%20INL-HiLoROM%20proto.jpg" alt="Image" /><br /><br /><img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/18341918/SNES%20INL-HiLoROM%20proto%20back.jpg" alt="Image" />

I've been slowly picking away at all of the info out there, as well as PCB scans for the SHVC-1A3M-XX/SHVC-1J3M-XX boards to try to achieve something similar, but with 5V parts (Altera MAX7000 PLD + ST M29F160F), and a hardware schematic would be incredibly helpful.  Also, is there any reason your design couldn't be expanded to 32Mb, or is it just because you're using 8Mb ROM chips and adding 2 more would add a lot of tracing complexity?  Since I'm using 16Mb chips, that would be less of an issue...

Everything you have fits on one side (save the battery), so toaster oven reflow should be a reasonable plan, and it would dramatically decrease the footprint. (Maybe too much, maybe it'd require a 4 layer board, dunno. That'd probably undo any gains from shrinking them. )

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Well the PCB is about as small as it could possibly get while still fitting the form factor of original cases.  So unless I have new cases tailored to a smaller PCB there isn't much to gain for board size.  These are still fairly simple for toaster oven reflow.  I think you're right going to BGA and requiring 4 layers would be a deal breaker.  The only thing that would push me to BGA is if I was looking to support something greater than Hi/LoROM to where components became more appealing or were restricted to BGA packaging.<br /><br />EDIT: Additionally there are significantly smaller package sizes available for things like the CPLD and SRAM without taking the step to BGA.  I've considered these, but coarser packages make for easier assembly and I was able to make them all fit so I took the benefit on the assembly side.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I can think of two possibilities wrt the PAR not working with flashcarts, latency or power consumption.  I know that the later revisions of the SNES reduced the power supplied to the cart bus to break the Game Genie because the Game Genie drew more power than a cart by itself.  If power is the issue, it may work with older revision consoles.

Even if it doesn't work with the PAR it is still useful and inexpensive.</div><br /><br />That is kinda what I was speculating as to why it doesn't work.  Basically most flash carts need to write to ROM for flashing/communicating the game you're trying to play.  The PAR was probably never designed for such a crazy newfangled type device.  So when the SNES tries to write to cart the PAR prevents those commands from getting to the cart.  I shouldn't have that problem, athough I can't be sure it's not something else without fully testing it out.  I don't plan to aquire a PAR myself, so I'd be interested in having you test it out for me.<br /><br />If power consumption is the issue I could be in trouble depending on how sensitive it is.  I haven't measured what I'm consuming yet, but those CPLDs can be power hogs depending on how fast/much you've got them switching.
