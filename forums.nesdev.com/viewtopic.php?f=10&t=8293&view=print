<br />Is that table to white and to black or only to black? I also use an unrolled loop to write the VRAM values.

<br />I do the color modifications in real time as I upload the palettes to VRAM, which means that palette updates take considerably more time, and have to "fight" for VBlank slots just like name/attribute/pattern table updates do. the advantage is that I don't waste RAM with the modified palette, or part of the frame's time to modify the palette.

<br />If you're not tight on RAM or CPU time, your way is probably better.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Heh, at first I tried to alternate hue modifications with brightness modifications (i.e. darker is bluer, lighter is yellower). This looked pretty good, but wasted a lot of space with tables, and was too slow to calculate at update time under certain conditions.
<br />
<br />Now I change just the brightness, but instead of modifying the whole palette at once, I change only colors of a certain brightness each frame. Based on the assumption that darker colors will reach complete darkness first when fading out, I first change all $0x colors to black. On the next frame I change all $1x colors to $0x. On the next frame, $2x becomes $1x, then $3x becomes $2x. At this point, the whole palette has shifted 1 brightness level down, and you can repeat the process. It takes 10 or 11 frames (can't remember) for the whole palette to become black, and it looks surprisingly smooth.
<br />
<br />I also have some special handling for the grays, since the gray scale is not like the others. I also ignore the whole $xD column, not only because $0D is evil, but also because not all PPUs have those colors (the RGB PPUs I think).

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />So, instead of decreasing the whole palette in a frame you do it in 4, one for each 16 colors. Is this done using tables?
<br />
<br />Also I've implemented a byte to activate which palettes you want to modify, so you can dark the background and let the sprites colorful like in MegaMan 2 (or dark only half background, and so on)
<br />
<br />Next thing I'm planning to do are Palette "timers" so you can configurate on the fly wich palettes are rotating (to left or to right) or maybe more effects than just rotating like switching the last colors, like also on MegaMan2 Metalman stage background gears.
<br />
<br />With this I hope be covering most of palette effects...

Is this done using tables?</div><br />Yeah, the first "wave" takes 4 frames, but the second one takes 3, since one row is already black. The 3rd takes 2 frames, and the 4th only 1 frame. This is where the 10 step figure comes from: 4 + 3 + 2 + 1 = 10.<br /><br />I use 2 tables for this. One of them has the output brightness for each of the 4 possible input values. Depending on the desired level of virtual brightness I point to a different part of this table. The second table is used to convert from a temporary format to the actual format used by the NES. The temporary format is used to easily/quickly manage the grays and make colors black and white as they reach the end of the fading sequence.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">Also I've implemented a byte to activate which palettes you want to modify, so you can dark the background and let the sprites colorful like in MegaMan 2 (or dark only half background, and so on)</div><br />This is an interesting idea. I don't have anything like that, the fading routine I described is global. If I want to have individual palettes fading I have to directly modify the colors in RAM. Some objects might have to do that.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">Next thing I'm planning to do are Palette "timers" so you can configurate on the fly wich palettes are rotating (to left or to right) or maybe more effects than just rotating like switching the last colors, like also on MegaMan2 Metalman stage background gears.</div>
<br />I have something like that... but either the level or objects control these animations.

This also allows a distinction in the palette between $20, which is ordinary white, and $30, which shows up as superbright white during fades.
