My Eprom eraser is just a bare bulb and a fixture about $25 altogether. Of course you shouldn't stare at it while it is on but routine caution should prevent burns. I stay out of the room or cover it while it is on. In hospitals where I work they have sterilizing lights which must be UVC and they are on all the time. However I don't recommend exposing yourself.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=236">Lloyd Gordon</a> — Sat Jun 17, 2006 7:58 am</p><hr />

EPROM's need UV at around 275nm to erase them, and they need a fairly high dose too.  Those LEDs output near-UV at around 395-405nm, which is way too long to do anything.<br /><br />Exposing EPROMs to sunlight doesn't work either... well, it CAN work but it takes a really long time... the equivelant of weeks of noontime tropical sun.  <br /><br />Don't even think about using a "blacklight" bulb or tube- those won't work either since the UV they output is similar to that from the LEDs.<br /><br />Long story short, you should probably just buy an EPROM eraser.  It's the easiest way to get the right kind of UV.    Note that this short wave UV that is required is very dangerous to exposed skin and eyes, and will give severe sunburns and nearly instant eye damage.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=230">kevtris</a> — Fri Jun 16, 2006 9:43 pm</p><hr />

Almost certainly not - the sort of UV you need to erase EPROMs would be extremely dangerous if it were coming out of a light pen.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=7">Quietust</a> — Fri Jun 16, 2006 8:00 pm</p><hr />
