		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />A few months ago I decided to start poking around with the hardware registers on my Super UFO Pro 8 SD to see if I could increase its usefulness by adding some USB dumping/rewriting support. A little while later I had <a href="https://github.com/devinacker/roswell" class="postlink">&quot;Roswell&quot;</a>, a combination of a server ROM and client Python scripts to allow pretty much exactly that.<br /><br />The overall system is still a pretty barebones work in progress, and I've mostly only been testing it for reading and not writing, but it should support doing both with pretty much any cartridge; it's capable of e.g. dumping a 32 Mbit SA-1 cart directly over USB in about 24 seconds, which beats the hell out of having to use the actual firmware's slow and cumbersome SD card support. I remembered other Super UFO-based tools being mentioned here and there so I figured I ought to remember to actually post mine.<br /><br />Anyway, a copy of my <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/devinacker/roswell/master/docs/regs.txt" class="postlink">hardware notes</a> for anyone who happens to be interested:<br /><br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">Super UFO hardware registers<br />by Revenant<br /><br />last updated 2018/07/18<br /><br />The registers at $2184-218f are automatically enabled when turning on the SNES,<br />but are disabled when launching a game, and are not enabled again if the reset<br />button is pressed.<br /><br />If the UFO registers are NOT enabled:<br />&nbsp;- Reading any register returns open bus<br />&nbsp;- Writing any register except $218a or $218b has no effect<br />&nbsp;- CH376 chip is powered off / USB connection is terminated<br /><br />All other values/effects mentioned below assume the registers are enabled.<br />So, to configure the memory layout, you have to:<br />- write #$0a to $218b to write-enable $218a<br />- write #$00 to $218a to enable BIOS and write-enable other registers<br />- write $2184-2189 to configure DRAM/SRAM/cartridge mapping<br /><br />and optionally (i.e. if booting a game)...<br />- write $218a again to disable BIOS and write-protect other registers<br />- write $218b to write-protect $218a<br /><br />The Super UFO uses the WinChipHead CH376 chip for USB communication and SD card<br />functionality. (See the PDF datasheets in this directory for details)<br /><br /><br />A point of interest:<br />On boot, the 9.x UFO firmware reads and writes $2180-83, $2188, $218d and $218f<br />as a means of decoding the routines which handle $2184-89 (probably to deter<br />counterfeit/clone hardware). It's currently unknown how to read anything from<br />$218d or $218f other than open bus, and writing $218d has no known effects.<br />The equivalent routines are stored &quot;in the clear&quot; in the old 8.x firmware.<br /><br /><br /><br />$2184 - memory control 1 (UFO SRAM mapping, SRAM size, DRAM size)<br />=================================================================<br />Controls which region of a given bank the UFO SRAM is mapped to, and how much<br />of it is exposed, as well as part of CPU-&gt;DRAM address translation.<br />Read from the bytes at $0012 and $0015 in the UFO header.<br /><br />W: CPU-&gt;DRAM offset (A22)<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;bit 7: add 16Mbit if A15 = 0 (HiROM upper 32k if 32 Mbit)<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;bit 6: add 16Mbit if A22 = 1 (LoROM if &gt;16 Mbit)<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;(see also $2186 below)<br /><br />if game uses SRAM:<br />W: bits 4-5 = UFO SRAM mapping (A15:12)<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;0: $6000-7fff<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;1: $0000-ffff<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;2: $0000-7fff<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;3: $8000-ffff<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;bits 0-2 = UFO SRAM size<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;0:&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;none (open bus)<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;1/4/5: $800 bytes (16 kbit)<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;2/6:&nbsp; &nbsp;$2000 bytes (64 kbit)<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;3:&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;$8000 bytes (256 kbit)<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;7:&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;$20000 bytes (1 Mbit)<br /><br />$2185 - memory control 2 (UFO SRAM mapping)<br />===========================================<br />Controls which banks the UFO SRAM is mapped to.<br />Each byte contains 2-bit logic states for 4 address lines, starting with A23<br />as the top two bits of $2185. <br />Read from the byte at $0016 in the UFO header.<br /><br />W: bits 6-7 = UFO SRAM mapping (A23)<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;bits 4-5 = UFO SRAM mapping (A22)<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;bits 2-3 = UFO SRAM mapping (A21)<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;bits 0-1 = UFO SRAM mapping (A20)<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;0/1: don't care<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;2:&nbsp; &nbsp;0<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;3:&nbsp; &nbsp;1<br /><br />$2186 - memory control 3 (DRAM size)<br />====================================<br />Controls the actual UFO DRAM address translation. <br />Essentially, determines which area of DRAM to map to a given SNES CPU address/bank.<br />The highest two bits of this value are in bits 6-7 of $2184, above. All applicable bits<br />in both registers must be set for DRAM address decoding/mirroring to work properly.<br />Read from the byte at $0013 in the UFO header.<br /><br />W: CPU-&gt;DRAM offset (A21:18)<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;bit 7: add 8Mbit if A15 = 0 (HiROM upper 32k)<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;bit 6: add 8Mbit if A21 = 1<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;bit 5: add 4Mbit if A15 = 0 (HiROM upper 32k)<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;bit 4: add 4Mbit if A20 = 1<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;bit 3: add 2Mbit if A15 = 0 (HiROM upper 32k)<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;bit 2: add 2Mbit if A19 = 1<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;bit 1: add 1Mbit if A15 = 0 (HiROM upper 32k)<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;bit 0: add 1Mbit if A18 = 1<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;(see also bits 6-7 of $2184 above)<br /><br />Essentially, the six highest address lines on the UFO DRAM are driven by<br />the output of a 5-bit adder, where the two inputs are<br />&nbsp; - bits 0/2/4/6 of $2186 and bit 6 of $2184, AND the respective bit in A22:18<br />&nbsp; - bits 1/3/5/7 of $2186 and bit 7 of $2184, AND the inverse of A15<br />&nbsp; <br />The remaining DRAM address bits are driven by A17:16 and A14:0, so these settings<br />effect every 32kb DRAM region within four consecutive banks (e.g. banks 80-83).<br /><br />In practice, the following combinations are used by the UFO firmware:<br /><br />Size&nbsp; &nbsp; LoROM&nbsp; &nbsp;HiROM<br />4Mbit&nbsp; &nbsp;$05&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;$09<br />8Mbit&nbsp; &nbsp;$15&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;$25<br />10Mbit&nbsp; $55&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;$37<br />12Mbit&nbsp; $55&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;$3d<br />16Mbit&nbsp; $55&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;$95<br />24Mbit&nbsp; $55*&nbsp; &nbsp; $f5<br />32Mbit&nbsp; $55*&nbsp; &nbsp; $55**<br /><br />*&nbsp; also set bit 6 of $2184<br />** also set bit 7 of $2184<br /><br />$2187 - memory control 4 (DRAM/cart mapping)<br />============================================<br />Controls which banks the UFO DRAM is mapped to when game mode is active, or<br />which half of the cartridge is mapped in when firmware mode is active.<br />Works like $2185 for DRAM. Read from the byte at $0014 in the UFO header.<br /><br />if firmware mode is enabled ($218a) and cartridge is enabled ($2189):<br />W: bits 6-7 = cartridge mapping (A23)<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;0:&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;cart A23 = 0 (cart banks $00-7d at $80-fd, open bus at $fe-ff)<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;1/2/3: cart A23 = 1 (cart banks $80-ff at $80-ff)<br /><br />if game mode is enabled ($218a) and DRAM is enabled ($2189):<br />W: bits 6-7 = UFO DRAM mapping (A23)<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;bits 4-5 = UFO DRAM mapping (A22)<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;bits 2-3 = UFO DRAM mapping (A21)<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;bits 0-1 = UFO DRAM mapping (A20)<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;0/1: don't care<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;2:&nbsp; &nbsp;0<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;3:&nbsp; &nbsp;1<br /><br />$2188 - memory control 5 &amp; hardware status<br />==========================================<br />Used to set LoROM/HiROM mapping for DRAM address translation.<br />Also returns different hardware info in bits 0-3 depending on what is written<br />to bit 7 of $218f.<br />Read from the byte at $0017 in the UFO header.<br /><br />if $218f &amp; #$80:<br />R: bits 0-3 = constant #$5 (hardware revision?)<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;bits 4-7 = open bus<br /><br />otherwise:<br />R: bit 0 (#$01) = no SD card<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;bit 1 (#$02) = ?

Here is some stuff i have found so far:<br /><a href="https://translate.google.com/translate?sl=auto&amp;tl=en&amp;js=y&amp;prev=_t&amp;hl=en&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww4.wazoku.net%2Fsfc.html&amp;edit-text=/url" class="postlink">Wazoku's programs</a><br />Contains fix for the 9.3A update and Memory cassette / Nintendo power rewriting program, etc.<br /><br /><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130317040949/http://swapmagic3.com/superufopro8/content.asp?id=7" class="postlink">Homepage</a><br />Contains drivers, manual and 9.2A update.<br /><br /><a href="http://junkerhq.net/UFO/" class="postlink">UFO manager</a><br />Patching program by My life in gaming<br /><br />I can also confirm that SA-1 and sFX chips are only ones that are not supported. But its only possible to play DSP1-A games with DSP1-B (mario kart and ballz 3d), but not the other way. And there might be issues with unpatched DSP1 LoRom (pilot wings).<br /><br />The Super UFO is based on the old floppy copying systems. So would it be possible to split the roms for bigger games, like they are split to disks?<br /><br />Here is some other notes:<br />You can use both ROM (think Game Genie) and RAM (think Action Replay) cheats at the same time.<br />You can find the cheats at <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://gamehacking.org/system/snes/all">http://gamehacking.org/system/snes/all</a><!-- m --><br />Here is a video about it: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDpQMdACpR8">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDpQMdACpR8</a><!-- m -->?<br /><br />Aladdin Pc app can convert SNES Game Genie codes into Golden Finger codes.

The unit would connect and<br />make new content available for download.<br /><br />Games on the system were often exclusive to the Satellaview, and can't be found anywhere else.<br />They were also available for only limited periods of time.<br /><br />Games could be saved to a RAM cart (BS-X adapter).<br /><br />The base unit had a 512 Kbit memory (RAM) chip to boost the SNES's capabilities and 1 Megabit ROM<br />chip that contained the operating system needed to control the Satellaview. It also had a 256<br />Kbit flash memory if the user hadn't bought him/herself an BS-X Special Broadcast Cassette that<br />contained a 1 Megabit flash memory chip.<br /><br />The BS-X cartridge resembles a Super Game Boy. It plugs into the cart slot as normal. Inside, it<br />has 8 MBits of ROM that holds the operating system and the interface software. It also holds and<br />extra 4 MBits of RAM. The little plug-in cart is actually a unique 'Flash ROM' cart that holds<br />game code without the use of Battery-Backed RAM. Unlike ROM, it can be wiped and overwritten by<br />special methods.<br /><br />Compatible memory paks:<br />8M Memory Pak - also bundled with the Satellaview system<br />Character Cassette - Bundled with SameGame application cartridge<br />Character Data Collection: Beyond the Heavens Compilation - also bundled with SameGame application cartridge as a contest prize<br />SD Gundam G-NEXT Unit &amp; Map Collection - also bundled with the SD Gundam G-NEXT application cartridge<br /><br />Compatible application cartridges:<br />BS-X The Story of The Town Whose Name Was Stolen - BS-X Sore wa Namae o Nusumareta Machi no Monogatari<br />Derby Stallion '96<br />Joushou Mahjong Tenpai<br />Ongaku Tsukuru: Kanadeeru<br />RPG Tsukuru 2<br />SameGame<br />SD Gundam G-Next<br />Shigesato Itoi's No. 1 Bass Fishing<br />Sound-Novel Tsukuru<br /><br /> Maker Tsukuru:<br /> ===========<br />RPG Maker Tsukuru 2<br />Music Maker Ongaku Tsukuru Kanaderu<br />Sound Novel Maker Tsukuru<br /><br />*Game creation tool from Success and ASCII Corporation. Game creation programs RPG Tsukuru for RPGs<br />and Ongaku Tsukuru Kanaderu for music. Sound Novel Tsukuru focuses on sub-genre of &quot;sound novels&quot;,<br />which are interactive visual novels with a sound component popularized by Chunsoft with games such as<br />Kamaitachi no Yoru (Banshee's Last Cry) before other developers started creating their own examples.<br /><br />As sound novels generally only require a backdrop, text and either music or ambient sound effects to<br />tell their stories, ASCII Corporation jumped on this level of simplicity by giving players all the<br />tools they need to create their own sound novels.<br /><br />The game was one of a number of Super Famicom games compatible with ASCII's &quot;Super File Twin&quot;<br />peripheral, which allowed for external save files on a separate device. The game was also supported<br />by the Satellaview, letting people download additional pre-made stories from the online service.<br />Sound Novel Tsukuru later saw a sequel, Sound Novel Tsukuru 2, for Sony PlayStation and Sega Saturn. <br /><br /><br /> Sufami Turbo:<br /> ==========<br />Linkable games:<br />SD Gundam Generation: 1-6 - links to all other SD Gundam games<br />SD Ultra Battle: Ultraman Legend - links to itself and Seven Legend<br />SD Ultra Battle: Seven Legend - links to itself and Ultraman Legend<br />Poi Poi Ninja World - links to Poi Poi Ninja<br /><br />Non-linkable games:<br />Crayon shin Chan - Nagagutsu Dobon<br />Gegege No Kitarou - Youkai Donjara<br />Sailor Moon Stars Panic 2 - Waku Waku Panic 2<br />Gekisou Sentai Car Ranger: Zenkai! Racer Senshi<br /><br />*Mini cartridge adapter to play smaller and cheaper Bandai games on SNES. The two cartridge slots are<br />designed to share data between the games. The cartridge placed in slot 1 is the game that will be<br />played, while the cartridge in slot 2 supplies additional data for use in the main game. Nine of the<br />thirteen SuFami Turbo titles make use of this system.<br /><br />Games that are linkable are identified by a yellow diagram showing a SuFami Turbo with either 1 or 2<br />cartridges in the lower right corner of the game box. If the pictures has 1 cart plugged into the<br />SuFami Turbo, it is not linkable. If it has 2 carts plugged into the SuFami Turbo then it is linkable<br />with the games mentioned on the box.<br /><br />Of the thirteen games released, nine of them were designed with the ability to link up, but not every<br />game can be linked with every other game. Only certain combinations exist, and those combinations<br />only exist within series of the same game.<br /><br />In Japan, the SuFami Turbo was released as a standalone unit, or with a pack in game. There is a list<br />of known pack in games below.<br /><br />The advertising pamphlet that comes packaged with the SuFami Turbo features Tetris 2 + Bombliss. This<br />game was never released for the system, but was released as a standalone SNES game.<br /><br /><br /> SF Memory:<br /> =========<br />Super Famicom flashcart was for japanese retail system. You could copy games to the cart from kiosks<br />or by sending it to somewhere for copying new games on it for cheaper. You can use SuperUfo to copy<br />new games on it. It doesnt support any of the special chips.<br /><br /><br /> Conveni Wars Barcode Battler II Card System:<br /> ============================================<br />Card / Barcode reader / scanner Battling game.
