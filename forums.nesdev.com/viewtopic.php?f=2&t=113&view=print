		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Hi there,
<br />
<br />If i wanna add a "pause" function to the game.
<br />What should I do? What i am thinking about is to enter 
<br />an infinite loop when a button is pressed; when i press it
<br />again, the game can go on again. If so, where should I put
<br />this piece of code to? within the main game loop? or at some 
<br />interrupt routines?
<br />
<br />Any idea on this?
<br />
<br />Best Regards,
<br />
<br />Brian

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />It really does depend on your code structure.
<br />
<br />Your idea to have an infinite loop that I assume will keep looping the button check routine until start is pressed again could possibly work. 
<br />Note: Remember interrupts (uncluding the VBLANK NMI) will trigger no matter what your code is currently doing (althopugh it will wait for the current instruction or DMC sample load to end ).
<br />
<br />Example (note: this is a simplified version of something you could do, the code should be more optimized and more complete <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":-)" title="Smile" />): 
<br />
<br />-this assumes everything has been properly initiated + VBLANK NMIs = On
<br />-also, I wrote this off the top of my head so there might be errors

<br />
<br />Aside from that... any split screen effects you're doing will still need attention.  If you don't split the screen when needed, you'll get scrolling (or other graphic errors) on the display.
<br />
<br />Plus you'll probably still have to refresh SPR-RAM every frame ($4014 write).
<br />
<br />In fact... when paused, you still have to do EVERYTHING your game normally does.  The only thing that's different is you don't allow the player to move/operate... and you stop the world (and enemies) from updating.  So I'd say just keep a 'pause' value somewhere in RAM and in the NMI code (or wherever your typical frame code is)... branch over the routines that update the player and world if the game is paused.

<br />To have a NMI routine that upload PPU registers, SprRam, etc... from buffers, call the sound code, etc....
<br />Your main programm can just does the actual gameplay things and upload buffer to be read in a NMI.
<br />So you have to check the JoyPad in the main thing, if start if pressed you have to wait it to be released, then wait it to be pressed again, then continius gameplay (otherwise you game will pause and unpause 60 times per seconds, and I guess that's not the thing you want). All NMI thing will of couse be still enabled with and witout pausing.

<br />
<br />Heh, I even left that out in my code example. Eh, it was late. Anyway, he'll defintly need to do that or the pausing will be horrible. He'll prolly need to do something like that for other keys as well (depending on the kind of game he's making).
