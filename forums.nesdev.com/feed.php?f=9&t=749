The code still drives it technically.  It has a 14 pin connector outline made to take a 2 by 7 pin header for a 14 pin ribbon cable to the display.  Pinout matches an LCD.  Note that the LCD's ENABLE line is being used for flash ROM carts... this won't affect anything of value though.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=230">kevtris</a> — Tue Nov 15, 2005 1:04 am</p><hr />

I always use my adultered converter when playing and dumping games.  What I did was pretty simple- I just lifted the pins of the fami connector up off the PCB with an x-acto knife as I heated the solder up.  then I got 8 560 ohm 1/4W 5% resistors and soldered them from the pins of the connector to the pads on the board.  I think I snipped them off a board.  The leads were super short but this was fine and was desireable for this job.  It's worked great for every single cart I've thrown at it.<br /><br />A couple times, some Sachen carts in the usual NES form factor were screwing up and crashing CopyNES (no licensed or 3rd party carts had ever done that) so I simply plugged my NES to fami converter into the adultered fami to NES converter and all was well <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":-)" title="Smile" />  Even though the cart was sticking way out why I was done, it worked.  I've chained no less than 3 converters before when I had the FDS RAM pack plugged in and that worked fine also.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=230">kevtris</a> — Sun Nov 13, 2005 1:33 am</p><hr />
