For one thing, APNG appears to be Firefox-exclusive; it doesn't show up in Safari or Chrome. It certainly isn't documented on libpng.org.<br /><br />And how would I save an animated screenshot in APNG format? What well-known free paint programs support writing APNG with more than one frame? GIMP 2.6.6 for Windows sure doesn't: saving as test.apng gave "The given filename does not have any known file extension. Please enter a known file extension or select a file format from the file format list.", and saving a 2-frame animation as test.png gave "PNG plug-in can't handle layers [Merge Layers] [Cancel]", unlike test.gif that gives a third button "[Save as Animation]".<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=9">tepples</a> — Wed Feb 24, 2010 8:35 am</p><hr />

And because I want credit for the original source code. <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />P.S. I didn't even know that there were any additional replies to this post except for the very first one.  I just happen to click on this one again while looking for other information. How do I get NesDev to let me know when there is a reponse to a particular post??? I have the "Notify me when a reply is posted" box checked but it seems to only work once.  Can I have the server e-mail me for all replies?
