The SPC700 will simply fetch different loop points as it plays the samples when the sample ID is changed without keying on the sample again.<br /><br />SNESGSS's change instrument feature directly messes with the sample ID and ADSR envelope, but doesn't key off the note automatically.

I have no idea what's going on, please keep filling in light on my dark places.<br /><br />Are you setting the loop point to somewhere inside the initial sample, or B) into a new sample altogether??<br />In the case of B, how did you precalculate a variety of samples that would provide the desired effect when the loop points were changed? What effect is this??<br /><br /><strong>Afterthoughts:</strong><br />It could be possible to have one sample ID, and just change its loop address.. Is it because it was easier for you to use many sample IDs that you didn't do what I'm suggesting?? Well, in my case, you could have up to 8 sample ID's (one for each voice, this provides potential for each voice to simultaneously play this new kind of instrument), each one individually having its loop points updated, and the effect could be reset at a voice's KON/KOFF. My method would  consolidate on sample IDs.

Using the same block allows the sample to start without incident, as my BRR converter (when using SNESMod) magically produced the same initialization blocks, so I simply removed duplicate blocks and matched the starting pointers (I also had to activate the loop flag in my starting BRR block: otherwise bad things could happen). The waveforms have to be relatively small in order for the effect to properly work.

What effect is this??<br /></div><br />It's B for my SNESGSS demonstration. For me, the &quot;pre-calculation&quot; was really just me creating the samples in a hex editor (which is how I optimized them so that they would play properly in the first place). <br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">bazz wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"><strong>Afterthoughts:</strong><br />It could be possible to have one sample ID, and just change its loop address..

My method would  consolidate on sample IDs.</div><br />This is a SNESGSS limitation. I can't just go in there and overwrite loop points like that. Had I coded my own sound driver, I would have indeed updated the loop points in the sample ID as they were playing. However, you have to put the sample directory in direct page (starting at direct page 100 or direct page 100). The reason is that you need to be able to move two bytes at one time using Y and A. Otherwise, you risk a cycle-exact glitch that results in the loop point being a pointer consisting one byte that's written and one byte that hasn't been written yet (which can result in a glitch if both have to be modified). KON/KOFF definitely resets this effect.

All I know in a rough sense is that he has sucessfully performed some effect on SPC, &quot;emulated&quot; by the use of rapidly altering loop points during a sample playback.. But from a general perspective, what did he produce. I'm looking for someone to say something like &quot;KFF implemented chorus on SPC&quot; -- I'm looking for that kind of explanation lol.<br /><br />Why did you have to hand code waveforms? Do these waves have to be &quot;simple&quot; like square, saw, sin?? or does the effect you made work with &quot;complex&quot; waves, like a flute or piano sample??<br /><br />Now, KFF, hopefully you're still reading, I have question based on your last post<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">KungFuFurby wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">...as I needed to initialize the BRR sample altogether.

If that's the case, you would simply be scrolling thru different samples right??? Maybe i will try assigning arbitrary brr end blocks along the way in this scrolling process.. But I'm still interested in what you did KFF. please consider including your snesgss file for analysis
