<br />Yes, you can do that. You don't need to change anything but the filename (and the ROM header of course).

<br />yes they has a mapper list with colors to indicate wich games works good,malfunction,glitchy,corrupting or do,nt work,but the list only show some weird numbers and not the name of the mappers,why not do the same as what they dit whith snes powerpak,putting an incompatilbility list.
<br />even games wich are stated to worh on it,can still not work becouse of damage and/or may require error correction (wich the powerpak lacks)i can,t get ducktales castlevania 1 etc,, too work,whereas i sew on youtube that on someones powerpak his ducktales rom jst work on it.

Although I'm sure the PowerPak is mostly used to play pirate games, RetroUSB sells it as a "development tool", meaning you are supposed to use ROMs you make/dump yourself, instead of using the pirate shit that comes from the internet. The PowerPak has no obligation to accommodate that.<br /><br />When you make the decision to use the PowerPak for piracy, you should at least have the decency of studying up why some games that are supposed to work don't and how to fix them, instead of publicly complaining that you can't easily steal games.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">note;i have the last update,so what,s the point??</div>
<br />Ducktales and Castlevania 1 use one of the simplest mappers ever, so it's definitely not the PowerPak's fault. Your ROMs probably have bad headers and/or are corrupted. Just download other copies until you find one that works or use an emulator that can fix headers, such as Nestopia and learn how to do it.

<br />Ah Kirby ... What a marvelous piece of software engineering.  
<br />
<br />Something you're doing with  the ROM is kicking the copy protection in. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" />  (Hint: It's checking if there's anything wrong with the backup memory to figure out if the cart is a pirate copy or if it's running on a copier.)

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />The exact reason for the problem is that Kirby checks the WRAM throughly:
<br />
<br />If it's smaller than 8KB
<br />
<br />If it can be write protected or not (Kirby is supposed to run on a TKROM board and that one has both CE and /CE pins connected to MMC3)
<br />
<br />And a few other sanity checks.
<br />
<br />If anything fails, the game runs but background changes oddly, stage layout is corrupted and you can spot "HAL" written on the background of the1st stage at the furthest part you can get to. Also, if you try to do the "inhale" move Kirby get stuck doing that.
<br />
<br />Why I know this ? When I was testing my MMC3 dev board I played around with the WRAM hookup and it only works properly when WRAM is hooked "right".

This was more along the lines of an actual freeze: music would freeze / continue doing what it was doing forever, all the graphics suddenly went BUHHHHH .. kind of like if you wiggle a cart around too much and some pins lose contact while playing a game.  Again Loopy's mmc3 mapper on that page fixes the issue.
<br />
<br />One other hilarious thing I had happen with the other MMC3 is that one time, the door to level 1 was a solid object: I could not run in front of it or go inside.  Probably the strangest glitch.

The writes to $E000-$FFFF were momentarily decoded to $6000-$7FFF because PRG /CE changes slightly later than A13-A14. This was noticeable as map corruption in M.C. Kids and Crystalis.
