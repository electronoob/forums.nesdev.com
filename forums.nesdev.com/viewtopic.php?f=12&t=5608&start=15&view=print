<br />
<br />The game doesn't detect the adapter, but the video system. In the PAL version there is a piece of code that reads register $213F and checks one bit to recognize the hardware it is running on (PAL or NTSC). If the flag doesn't match with the game region, it resets or prints out a message. Secret of Mana had the same protection, and some others games too.

<br />
<br />Maybe, it makes sense... but that implies the adapter has some logic on it (some circuitry) and therefore is more advaced that mine: I own a HoneyBee that has only paths on the PCB (no circuitry on it), which route the CIC signals from slot B to the SNES control deck.

<br />The latter is likely. DKC should run fine on a lockout-modded PAL SNES, at least in 60 Hz mode. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /> Under 50 Hz, it will present the Rare and Nintendo logos and then give you an error message (unless you have region-deprotection circuitry in your adaptor, of course).

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I just wanted to say that now that I could test it with my super-powerpak I confirm that my adapter definitely somehow highhacks tha $213f register to make games think they're on a NTSC SNES.
<br />
<br />So for region locked games... I have to play NTSC games with the adapter, and PAL games without it. For non-region locked games, it's a non-issue.
<br />I also confirm my Power Pak works fine with my adapter so people who have it could spare $3 for the CIC (which I didn't - I went the safe way).
<br />
<br />There is also semi-region locked games such as Megaman 7 and Mega Man X, they print a warning message if the wrong region but the game still runs.
<br />
<br />Despite the warning, unlike the NES, it's extremely rare to find a game which runs into NTSC/PAL problems with the SNES. The only problem I've ever found was with Chrono Trigger's intro where the music has to find it's way to the ending, some tracks ends while others continue to loop and it sounds ugly. There is probably other games with issues tough I didn't encounter them.
