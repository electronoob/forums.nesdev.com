<br />Facts(?):
<br />-N called sprites objects (OBJ) even then

<br />-"CIRAM" is VRAM

<br />Is this a touchy subject since it might be misconstrued as trade secrets?

<br />
<br />Only if it's legal, which pretty much means "no". Any documentation produced by Nintendo will be at the very least copyrighted, and I'd be highly skeptical of any claims that Nintendo had allowed it to be freely distributed. At this point, our own reverse-engineering effort is not far from being complete, and the information is more reliable than any documentation (except perhaps one marked up with notes and corrections by a NES programmer).

<br />They might be interesting, though they'd be yet another alternate name for whatever they are commonly called. And if they are as bad as the names for the Game Boy sound registers (NR12, NR25, etc.), I'll pass! <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />

Everything is copyrighted (unless specified otherwise), it only effectively matters if the owner cares.  Somehow I don't think Nintendo would care much about a few people looking at some obsolete docs for free.
<br />
<br />I'd just be interesting to see.  There's no way we could get anything new out of it, just no way it could be as detailed as the all the info we have scattered around now.  It'd be much more interesting to see notes about the hardware or the TTL schematics of the chips, but I doubt that info will ever see the light of day even though it's certainly out there somewhere on some giant pages of paper.

<br />Searching Y! Groups for "stooges" should give posts by Andrew Davie related to a licensed game that failed lot check because the PPU on one of Nintendo's test units was overheating.

<br />Since the piracy and reversing of the GBA has hurt sales, Nintendo really DOES hate all reversers and homebrewers as well, I think. They won't let anyone touch anything official, they'd try to sue everyone instead.
<br />
<br />BTW I'm surprised the Nintendo Power magasine seems to had mentionned mappers and all. I don't think many players will care if they have a discrete logic mappers or a custom chip mapper in their favourite cards. Or was it a magasine only for technical experts ?

<br />Also, the scaling/rotating on GBA wich is NOT especially mode 7 is still always refered to mode 7, just as it would be the SNES.
