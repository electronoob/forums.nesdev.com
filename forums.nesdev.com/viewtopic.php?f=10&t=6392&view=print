<br />(This post implies NTSC)
<br />
<br />I finished the CPU emulation, and heading now towards the PPU.
<br />I'm finding the PPU render timing really complex, so I want to know if I understand it at least roughly so I can start to figure out how to implement it.
<br />
<br />So What I understand is this:
<br />Each CPU cycle equals 12 PPU cycles, CPU runs at 1.79 Mhz and PPU at 21.47 Mhz.
<br />The source of timing in my emulator are the instructions that are being executed, so for each CPU cycle executed in its instructions, I advance the PPU renderer 12 cycles.
<br />Each pixel takes 1 PPU cycle, so each scanline takes 341 PPU cycles including hblank.
<br />There are 262 scanlines including vblank period, so a frame occurs every 89342 PPU cycles.
<br />89342 / 12 = 7445.17, so each 7445.17 CPU cycles are executed, I trigger an NMI.
<br />What I never saw in a doc is when I have to start counting down to the first NMI, so I guess it's from the first ever cycle executed by the CPU, that's the first cycle of the first instruction at the RESET address.
<br />
<br />Is this right? did I get something wrong?
<br />Thanks!

<br />For the most part you understand it correctly.  Your numbers were just a little off.

<br />
<br />So what would be a better/faster way?
<br />
<br />I like your idea of master cycles, I'll use it.
<br />
<br />I guess I'll start the rendering loop together with the first CPU instruction, and having rendering disabled by default, until the program turns it on.
<br />I guess that although rendering is turned off by the program, the vblank countdown is not altered, right?

<br />HBlank as used in descriptions of NES hardware is any part of the scanline that is not dots 0-255.

<br />
<br />But in other descriptions it's time similar to VBlank where writing to the PPU is safe.  Of course the NES has no such time between scanlines because it's always busy fetching.

<br />So no writes to VRAM can be made between scanlines? at least scrolling writes can be made, or at least that's how I always thought mid-frame scrolling effects were made.
<br />
<br />Even if I don't get PPU timing totally accurate, games that don't use mid-scanline or mid-frame effects other than sprite 0 hit test, will work well anyway, right?

<br />
<br />Yes you don't have to be super accurate for most games to run.  But the more accurate you are, the less chance of visual glitches and shaking status bars.

<br />
<br />I'm confused, so why does the NTSC PPU run at 21.47 Mhz which is 12 times the 1.79 Mhz of the CPU ?

The hue signal generator (see <a href="http://wiki.nesdev.com/w/index.php/NTSC_video" class="postlink">NTSC video</a>) needs a clock signal with twelve edges for each cycle of the color subcarrier, which in the case of NTSC is 3.58 MHz. So the master clock is always set at six times the subcarrier's frequency, which provides the desired signal with six rises and six falls. Only the hue generator uses this clock signal directly; it is divided down by 4 (NTSC) or 5 (PAL) before it hits the rest of the PPU.

<br />
<br />Depending on the <a href="http://catb.org/jargon/html/P/phase-of-the-moon.html" class="postlink">phase of the moon</a> at power-on, the CPU clock (master/12) can be delayed by 0, 1, 2, or 3 master clock cycles from the dot clock (master/4). This can cause a program that depends on certain edge cases to behave differently from one reset to the next.
