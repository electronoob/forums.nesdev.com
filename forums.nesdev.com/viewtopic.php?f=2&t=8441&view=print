<br />think how bad ass it would be to IRC from a NES, or better yet run a web server on it.

<br />Isn't there is not too much RAM by default to run a webserver?
<br />
<br />It is certainly possible to hook up an ethernet adapter, was done with other 8-bit systems, but to make any use for it you may need a pile of extra hardware.

<br />
<br />I remember Windows 2000 Server had the capability to allow dialing INTO the server for Internet access.  If you had the Famicom Modem and knew enough about coding a TCP/IP stack (maybe use code from Contiki) it could be done with an of-the-shelf PC.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />So has anyone began the work at coding a PPP &amp; TCP-IP stack on the NES? By now there should be <em>plenty</em> of example code to make the task easy.
<br />
<br />But there will certainly be some limitations; TCP does require some amounts of RAM. But if you overlook some compatibility issues, and e.g. assume that a packet is never lost, you might be able to make a ROM-based web server on the NES.
<br />Then, use an UDP based protocol to conjure up extra RAM for the game through serial / LAN link!
<br />Molasses slow RAM, but still RAM. Possibly windowed for efficiency.

<br />
<br />If I were to do this with minimal cost, I would connect a serial port on a PC to a serial port expansion for the NES, or bit-bang the 2nd joypad port, and let a PC do all of the heavy lifting.
<br />
<br />I know that this isn't a "pure" solution, but it would be much easier to develop and test, and probably cheaper.  If you really want the NES to to packet re-assembly, you're going to burn lots of CPU cycles and needs lots of RAM.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />The idea of ethernet on NES has came up several times over the years, you can search this forum to find everything.  chykyn is a recent developer who had been working on the hardware and software for it.
<br />
<br />The older version of Contiki was able to compile with CC65, so there is that existing code.  But I tend to agree with what clueless was saying, about leaving the heavy lifting to a separate coprocessor.
<br />
<br />I had previously looked around for software that would let the NES access the internet over the PC's serial port, but the only software I could find to do it was commercial, and also requires entering the target IP address on the PC-side.
<br />
<br />I'm wanting to build the NES to USB adapters, so anything like this would be great.  I'd really like to make an FTP client for NES, but I'm not sure how I would deal with the TCP stuff.

Or in this case a functional demo hardware ethernet adapter for the NES.  It's called the ENIO (Extended NES IO).  It provides ethernet, USB KB and serial connectivity.  Yes, it does require a custom cart since signals must be sent over the EXP pins...<br /><a href="http://nesdev.com/bbs/viewtopic.php?t=7313&amp;highlight=exp" class="postlink">http://nesdev.com/bbs/viewtopic.php?t=7313&amp;highlight=exp</a><br /><br />Here are pictures of the dev board (50-pin cable connects to EXP) as well as the first board that actually mounts under the NES.<br /><br />A dev board for a 100mb ENIO<br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.chykn.com/ENIO-DevBoard.jpg">http://www.chykn.com/ENIO-DevBoard.jpg</a><!-- m --><br /><br />Bottom shot of the first "mounted" 100mb ENIO<br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.chykn.com/ENIO-Rev1.jpg">http://www.chykn.com/ENIO-Rev1.jpg</a><!-- m --><br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">clueless wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">If I were to do this...

<br />Yes, that is exactly how it works.  The PIC32 offloads the TCP/UDP processing and provides buffering.  The NES sends commands to the ENIO telling it where to connect; the ENIO replied with a VCID (virtual channel ID) for the new session.  There's still plenty of opportunity for refinement, but the client functionality is there.
