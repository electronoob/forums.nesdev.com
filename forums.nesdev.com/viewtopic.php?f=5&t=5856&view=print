<br />I won't even have time to finish my proof of concept for mm9 before this one will be out!.. Oh well. I should have known that Capcom, once they make a game, they spur million sequels out of it after anyway. 
<br />
<br />I guess I shouldn't mind much since the goal is to build my engine for my own game and that part is moving forward at least (but stalled for the moment, no time).

<br />
<br />- For MegaMan, it's just confusion here. There's the classic MegaMan, those games released for the NES, now with 10. However, MM6 was the last one and the "need" for a new generation was "a must have", so they came with a new project: the X series. Eventually, the classic MM has been continued, and more parallel series published.
<br />
<br />- In short words, I don't see any sign of confusion here.

<br />- I didn't get what you mean here, but hell... the "X" was never meant to be "10". In fact, I though about that "X" being a mask; heh, after reading the story, it's clear that "X" is a robot.

<br />Of course we, NES fans and programmers, are very interested in an 8-bit revival, because it makes our hobby more relevant to the rest of the world, but it doesn't seen the rest of the world is much interested in 8-bit anymore.

<br />- MM9 and 10 were NOT made to "<a href="http://gameon.msn.com/articles/4287/Editorial-In-Defense-of-Mega-Man-10" class="postlink">Nouveaux Gamers</a>". Capcom knows that and did a statement regarding such subject: for retro MM players. It's one of the greatest gifts in my life, since I'm not a fan of realistic-3D-killing games. Since they're fine with MM9 sales, well, MM10 could do even more.

<br />
<br />Exactly. And that's the reason I don't own any of the current-gen systems -- I have zero use for them. I just can't see myself spending $200+ on a console just to play this. I wish they would offer this as a PC download. For $5, it wouldn't even be worth the risk of pirating (viruses, etc), that's an instant sell for me.
<br />
<br />Still holding out hope that eventually these games will be fan-ported or emulated ...

<br />My point was that even retro gamers, the target audience of the game, seem to think that one game in 8-bit style was enough. I've read so many times "I wish Mega Man 10 looked like a 16-bit game"...
<br />
<br />I hope they keep making them look 8-bit, in fact I'd even like game series other than Mega Man to receive similar treatment.
