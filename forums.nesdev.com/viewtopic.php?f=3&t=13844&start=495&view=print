Unsure.)</div>No, the internal work RAM should be specified, and <em>must</em> be specified for games that battery-back only the internal RAM and use it for save-game purposes, such as Mindseeker. The only time that the internal work RAM is not specified is when there is both internal work RAM and 8 KiB of WRAM and both or neither are battery-backed, to prevent the non-power of two size from having to round up. For all these games, such as Megami Tensei 2, it's also possible to denote the 128 byte of work RAM as non-battery-backed (since the games will not use it for save game data but for sound or not at all, which I verified with every single game), and the 8 KiB of WRAM as battery-backed. And you need to specify the 128 byte of battery-backed EPROM in Mapper 159 as well.<br /><br />I have modified the N163TEST rom to run from $E000. Mesen's N163 emulation does not seem tor emulate the situation in which only one channel is enabled accurately, though, as I cannot hear anything in that situation.

The sound output was in fact disabled when only 1 channel was enabled - this should be fixed.  The test rom appears to work properly now, but I haven't compared with other emulators.  I also fixed the crash that the 128 bytes work ram header was causing.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">gauauu wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">I've been getting quite a few crashes on Linux/mono ever since upgrading</div>That crash seems to imply that this is caused by Mono crashing while trying to process the regular expressions I use to read the .DBG files, which is very odd.  Most of the other threads in the process seem to be paused, so it seems unlikely that they would be causing issues, either.. Can you try disabling the &quot;auto-load .DBG files&quot; option to see if the crashes stop?<br /><br />I just tried getting it to crash on Ubuntu 18 by power cycling on a ROM with a .DBG file but couldn't.  I'm assuming you haven't upgraded mono, either?

It's possible that Mesen's C++ code is somehow corrupting memory and causing Mono to crash, though, but it is somewhat unlikely..

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Sorry gauauu for interrupting your conversation with Sour.<br /><br />Sour, after installing 0.9.6 the last two trace log files I've made today are extensionless.  Why?  It was changed from .log to .txt and that was ok, but now, when opening new trace log files, I have to select notepad from a list and resize notepad's window and change the font.  Either that or I must type &quot;.txt&quot; at the end of every new trace log filename, I guess; haven't tried that yet.  So I was wondering, would it be terrible to add a blank and a .txt and a .log to the empty <tt style="margin-left: 2px; margin-right: 2px; padding:3px; background-color: #3355aa; color: white;">Save as type:</tt> menu that's underneath the <tt style="margin-left: 2px; margin-right: 2px; padding:3px; background-color: #3355aa; color: white;">File name:</tt> menu?  It seems to me that Windows 10 can remember <tt style="margin-left: 2px; margin-right: 2px; padding:3px; background-color: #3355aa; color: white;">Save as type:</tt> choices. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />I'm asking you that because I don't understand anything about creating programs that run on many different system types. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_redface.gif" alt=":oops:" title="Embarassed" />

Could you try running an older 0.9.5 dev build (e.g one you were using before, or one from the appveyor builds) to see if the crashes really don't happen with it?<br />Or maybe it only happens when you have specific tools opened? e.g this crash implies you had the PPU viewer opened.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">unregistered wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">Sour, after installing 0.9.6 the last two trace log files I've made today are extensionless.</div>I think this is probably because you manually changed the output file's name?  It won't add the .txt suffix automatically because the &quot;file type&quot; dropdown is empty. As far as I can tell though, it's been this way ever since I changed it from .log to .txt and let users choose the filename, back in March 2017. It's essentially caused by a typo in the code - the latest commit fixes it.
