<br />
<br />NEStopia has support for this.  Options -&gt; Database.  It supports both internal and external (a file) databases.  I imagine all it actually reads is the GoodNES database (I'd have to read the README to verify).
<br />
<br />Anyway, to circle back to the original point: for what it's worth (not much), I'm an opponent of replacement file formats for NES ROMs.  The simple reason that what came first (the original iNES format) is what will stay; it doesn't matter if your format is superior, has many advantages, solves tons of problems, or even complies with the Right Thing(tm).  While a select few care about such, the rest of the world (read: majority) just want to play games.  Existing emulators and tools already read the iNES format, and that's pretty much the end of it.  I do, however, agree with approaches like the iNES 2.0 format (which retains existing compatibility).
<br />
<br />If you want a perfect example of an attempted iNES format replacement that failed, look at UNIF.  If you think I'm passing judgement, I can try to dig up a private mail I received from Tennessee Carmel-Veilleux talking about how such an effort (on his part) was truly pointless, and he actually regrets doing so -- and as such, asked that I remove all references to his efforts (yes really).  I say this as humbly as possible.
<br />
<br />This isn't to say your efforts are worthless, unnoticed, or unappreciated.  It's that ultimately at the end of the day nobody is going to bother switching to a new format.
<br />
<br />You can try something like <a href="http://byuu.org/bsnes/user-guide" class="postlink">what bSNES is doing</a> (refusing to support all sorts of ROM formats, particularly .SMC which is used by the majority and instead insisting everyone use .BIN), but all that will do is alienate you (or in the case of bSNES, the emulator) from the rest of the world.  Again: it doesn't mean the approach is wrong, but is wasted effort at this point in time.
<br />
<br />EDIT: And yes, I'm well-aware that the discussion is with regards to a ROM database or equivalent.

<br />I don't know... But I'm convinced that what this community doesn't need is a half-assed replacement for iNES that only works for old licensed games. Note that by "half-assed" I don't mean that you didn't put any effort into this, because I'm sure you did, what I mean is that your solution is far from ideal, and barely improves the current situation.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Fitzroy, I understand your proposal, and its merits.  However, as a homebrew developer, I would find it rather annoying to have to update my database after every build just to test my games.  If the emulator supported by iNES and your scheme, then fine.
<br />
<br />These are a few issues that I see:
<br />
<br /><ol style="list-style-type: decimal"><li>Who keeps the database up to date?</li><li>Does anyone "own" it?  I imagine that since it catalogs mostly ripped commercial games, the creator(s) of database entries are not too concerned with IP ownership rights.</li><li>What happens when the database fragments, forks, branches or whatever?</li><li>How would an emulator detect if it has the "correct" database (ie, the one shipped or supplied by the user might still have incorrect mapper info).</li><li>Would it include checksums for hacks, like "Zelda Outlands" and some metroid edits?</li><li>What about games that I hack myself?

How do you prevent the same incorrect data from making it into the database?</li></ol>
<br />
<br />I think that it is better to fix the iNES header (like iNES 2.0 is trying to do).
<br />
<br />Maybe it is better to publish a program with a built-in database that just analyzes one's ROM collection.  It should checksum the prog-rom and char-rom, look up the correct ines header, and just fix the image in-place.  For any set of checksums not in the database, leave the file alone, but generate a warning to the user.  A user could run the tool whenever they add a rom to their collection and not worry about it any further.

<br />Why do everyone want to use force? A much better approach to a new format would be if we got the popular emulators still in development to open a dialog box asking "This file is using an older format. Would you like to convert it to the more recent .THE_BEST_NES_FORMAT format?" with a "Yes", "No", "Always" and "Don't Ask Me Again" options. Obviously, if we can't get the popular emulators to agree on this there is no reason to even think about a new format.

<br />
<br />I would use a tool that operated like the first (keep ines header, and tool just fixes roms).
<br />
<br />What "database" file format would you use?  csv, raw binary blob (typically an array of structs), custom text file format?  sqlite container (really nice option, imho), or what?  Just please don't say OLE container. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />
<br />
<br />If you chose a printable text file format, I would suggest that each ROM be on a line by itself, but that the entire record not span multiple lines.  This makes mgmt by grep, sed, awk, etc... much easier.
<br />
<br />What kind of implementation were you thinking of?

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I think all successor formats fail because emulator authors don't need to thus don't care to implement databases, XML parsing or a universal netlist mapper interpreter (which will probably need dynamic linking and massive reworking of existing code). Some emulators don't even have ZIP support.
<br />
<br />Preservation people pedantically fight for straight binary, despite the mapping ambiguity it causes on many platforms, because anything else is an eyesore to them. It's not wrong, but it really sets back creation on the NES since there's no default mapping to fall back on with games greater than 40 KiB. Imagine if every bitmap image required a separate description file or database... Since even preservationists will agree creating new games is good, some board info must be packaged with even the most straight-forwardly programmed NES ROMs. Since the current iNES 1.0 implementation works for 99% of the library, where's the motivation to move on?
<br />
<br />All of its shortcomings (bugs in one-off mapper games) are addressed via iNES 2.0 and the few discrete mapper ROMs with broken mirroring (oh my!) in the wild can be fixed with a database powered renaming and header-fixing tool. As of now this has become just another bike shed debate, iNES 1.0 beat out all the competition fair and square and it gets the job done, kind of like TCP/IP. New proposals aren't even BETTER, they're just different in their philosophy following the author's agenda. 
<br />
<br />As for the netlist mapper, this is something I played with (and the reason I started an emulator years ago). I quickly lost interest because it had no hope of catching on and I was too OCD to follow through on the engineering side. Later I came to the belief that anyone developing their own hardware/mapper can just as easily implement it in a popular open source emulator for testing purposes. Also I now believe that game developers shouldn't go out of their way to make a custom mapper just for the sake of making a custom mapper. I believe if they do, and their game is good, the mapper will be supported by emulators naturally.

You cannot buy these actual games from the manufacturer because they are no longer made. You cannot even get them in new condition unless you pay $500+ on eBay per game.

Would you like to convert it to the more recent .THE_BEST_NES_FORMAT format?" with a "Yes", "No", "Always" and "Don't Ask Me Again" options. Obviously, if we can't get the popular emulators to agree on this there is no reason to even think about a new format.</div>
<br />
<br />In my case, I didn't want the legacy crap polluting my codebase. I am very philosophically opposed to even keeping it around. My choices will never have any mainstream impact anyway, so why bother? I agree, to do something like this properly would need the popular emulators to offer conversion support right inside the emulator. Start for 1-2 years with a simple "hey do you want me to fix this game? Yes/Always/No/Don't ask again". Next two years, "hey I need to fix this to play it. Yes/Always/Don't play". After that, 1-2 years of auto-fix. And then finally, drop the legacy support.
<br />
<br />Still think it's impossible? Most early SNES ROMs were interleaved for copiers. Try and find interleaved games now. Change is possible, you just have to get past the emu authors themselves who believe it is not.
<br />
<br />-----
<br />
<br />As for the actual new NES format idea ...
<br />
<br />The particularly nice thing of my approach is that images that run in bsnes also run everywhere else, but that was not a requirement of mine, just a happy coincidence. We would need something like an nespurify tool, and it would have to make copies rather than convert images, at least by default.
<br />
<br />We had something special in the SNES scene. Unlike the NES, where there are more emulators than there are stars in the sky, there are really only two significant SNES emulators. Get two to prefer and auto/manual convert to the new format, and this would be a done deal. It would solve a dozen problems and hurt nobody. ROM sites would update when all of their users asked them to.
<br />
<br />But even with two projects, only two, maintaining popularity at the expense of preservation (aka "piracy" amirite guys lolz) is more important.
<br />

<br />
<br />FitzRoy, I appreciate what you're doing here. I am very much in favor of pure, unadulterated images. I prefer allowing for the possibility of per-game XML mappings of the cartridge hardware, but am all for an internal database for commercially released images for easy fixes/updates.
<br />
<br />Unfortunately, I have to agree with everyone else here. With their attitudes, and these are the emulator authors themselves who have suffered from iNES problems personally, you stand no chance of convincing anyone to use this new format. The only thing I think you can do is pay someone (not me :P) to add support for your format into a one-off build of eg Nestopia.
<br />
<br />I say, do it anyway. The right thing is the right thing, even if it isn't popular. But be prepared for the entire world treating you like an idiot, an asshole, a zealot trying to force them to change against their will, and to be completely and utterly ungrateful for what you're doing.

<br />No need to be so offended, I didn't attack anyone personally, and certainly not you. The thing is that just like you are offended to be called a pirate, I am offended by people neglecting homebrews as important pieces of software. I mean, it's not like we're gonna lose any NES games, I'm pretty sure they've all been dumped a hundred times over, they are preserved. Now, we live in a time where several people are working on interesting NES games again, some have been finished and hopefully many more will be soon. Yet, some people are still so focused in the past that we keep seeing these shortsighted solutions that don't care about the current developments.
<br />
<br />I'm sorry if I perceive this obsession with properly supporting exclusively the old licensed games as a desire to own every bit of commercial software ever rather than actual love by the platform itself, as we could very well be about to witness a big revival of the NES thanks to the new software being made for it, but it looks like the software preservation people just don't care, since they are still coming up with stupid ROM format solutions that do not take new developments into consideration.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Yeah sorry, you kind of implied that all people who preserve software are just into piracy; which is the notion I was saying 'fuck you' to. If that's not what you meant, then that's not what I meant toward you. Software preservation = piracy is the opposite of reality. As an emulator author, that's a fairly major insult.
<br />
<br />The pirates I see are the guys wanting the GoodTools ROM sets with the seven thousand header variants and known-bad dumps and juvenile "Super Penis Bros" hacks included. Those are the guys who stuff everything into 7-zip multi-archive packs and seed it around on torrent sites.
<br />
<br />Preservation implies all games, so I'm not sure how I can defend against the fact that preservationists do want all games. Yeah, that's kind of the point. But I'd still prefer the guy that has all 2,000 games for the purpose of making sure they are not lost to the sands of time; over the guy who downloads every game he personally wants to play. Both of them are technically committing copyright infringement, but the former is potentially doing something much more important.
<br />
<br />But I should also say, I don't think many of us hate homebrew/fan translations/etc right off the bat or anything. Hell I've spent nearly a decade fan translating RPGs. It was a big goal of mine personally to use an XML mapping that could be applied to any homebrew game. I've even prototyped custom chips to help make homebrew even better.
<br />
<br />The reason you see less focus is because: a) you cannot dump and verify a software-only ROM image, and b) unlike official games, which is a finite set, homebrew is an infinite set that can theoretically be added to until the end of time. It's disheartening to work on a project that you know can never come to completion.
<br />
<br />The unfortunate thing to me is that many homebrew authors don't even seem to care about preservation of their own works. They often only test on the most popular and least accurate emulator, create software that won't run except on said emulator, and some even hack up emulators to support extra features that are impossible on real hardware. What am I supposed to do?
<br />
<br />I am all for archiving homebrew, but there are some really tough problems with it. Official games are at least of <em>some</em> degree of quality that they were published and sold. Those juvenile SMB hacks? I really don't care if those are never preserved, sorry. Great SMB hacks? It would be a shame to lose those.
<br />
<br />So how do we preserve it? I suggest an XML-based mapping system. Yes, it has the unfortunate problem that everyone will have to support said format, and it's damn-near impossible to get those formats 100% correct. You're going to find a game that pushes the limits, and you have to extend the spec, and now you have competing implementations?
<br />
<br />I don't think it's a 'fuck homebrew' attitude, but 'how in the world can I preserve homebrew even if I wanted to?' attitude.
<br />
<br />It just seems silly to argue against better, bit-perfect, heuristic-free, hacky made-up-header-free support for official games of a known, finite quantity. If the status quo for fan translations and homebrew is iNES, this effort does not have to negate that. By example, I still have the old manual header parsing stuff myself, for those homebrew images that lack an XML mapping as well.
<br />
<br />But I'm not going to let official dumps be mediocre just because I cannot catalog an infinite number of homebrew games.
<br />
<br />EDIT: so what we want is clean images without headers, and what others want is homebrew. Why not make the iNES header a separate file, gamename.nes + gamename.ines. Stick it in a ZIP file. Emulators from here can properly checksum games, and use internal database info, and fall back on the iNES headers as needed. Databases are free to add homebrew checksum entries or not. Homebrew authors include the .ines file regardless. Just another theoretical idea that will never happen because nobody will do it, but it seems reasonable to me.

<br />
<br />
<br />Not like adding 20 bytes doesn't destroy the ROM, it's there. Extract it! And with that format you also need two files, which lugging two files on my PC instead of insta-clicking one and is brough up in FCEUX perfectly is annoying. You'd need a linker filer to tell what two ROMs to use anyway.
