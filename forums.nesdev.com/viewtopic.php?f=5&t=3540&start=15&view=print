I know how to dump a Genesis cartridge, but not an NES cartridge</div><br />The NES Game Pak cart bus has two mostly independent sides that you need to consider. One connects to the CPU, the other to the graphics chip (PPU). Some games have a ROM on both sides ("PRG ROM" for the CPU and "CHR ROM" for the PPU); others have ROM on the CPU side and "CHR RAM" on the PPU side, which the program in PRG ROM fills with data through the PPU's I/O ports.<br /><br />Dumping NES games that use CHR RAM is a lot like dumping games for Game Boy or Sega Master System. You start by giving commands to the "mapper", a bank switching controller with a few <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory-mapped_IO" class="postlink">memory-mapped write-only registers</a> on the CPU side of the cart. For each 16 KiB bank in the game, you tell the mapper to turn it on, then you dump $8000 through $BFFF. Dumping NES games that use CHR ROM is more difficult: you also have to step the mapper through all the banks using commands on the CPU side and then dump 1 to 8 KiB chunks on the PPU side.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">The PCB btw says "NES-SGROM-04"</div>
<br />Luckily, the <a href="http://nesdevwiki.org/wiki/index.php/SGROM" class="postlink">SGROM board</a> uses VRAM, so you can just dump the program from the CPU side.

<br />I don't know if that's just a cart made by someone with the japanese ROM but if a game intended to run on SNROM is running on SGROM, it will probably crash pretty soon, as it will rely on it (and not ONLY to save, in 99% of the cases). It is so probably a hacked version (possibly from a dirty chinese pirate) made from another game using a NES-SGROM-04 board.
<br />
<br />EDIT : Your file have similarities with the japanese cartridge Zelda, however it still have a ton of differencies, and your file is a strange size (I had to remove some 300 bytes at the begining to have it being actually 1 megabit to fit a NES ROM). I'd like to have some pictures of the thing so we can take this thing seriously (as I know you !).

<br />I noticed I can now go in the dungeon, but the game does infact seem to lockup randomly..  (maybe not randomly, it may be how im playing, or something im doing that is causing the lockup, like, certain Gems?)
<br />
<br />Btw, how do I make the .bin I dumped work in an emulator?  It doesn't work, the emulators just say it's a format they don't understand..

<br />In fact that is the case on the real Zelda (japanese cartridge) ROM data, however, the dump of Evildragon seems to be bad for it's strange size.
<br />Aside of that, once the dump is correct, you have to add 10 bytes : NES, $1a, $08, $00, $10 to make it run (assuming a SGROM board) and rename the file to *.nes
<br />
<br />EDIT : By the way I forgot to mention SRAM on the cartridge can also be used for general purpose memory usage by the game (as the internal 2K will not always be enough) and that most (if not all) battery backed sram games also use the SRAM for general purpose. For that reason, if the SRAM is lacking (as it's the case with SGROM) the game will glitch and frezee pretty fast.

<br />I was noticing this myself, that it wasn't 128KB like I expected it to me (because it's not even a multiple of 8KB)..
<br />
<br />It might have been my EPROM programmer, or the software it uses...  I think it's a fluke..
<br />
<br />EDIT:  I just tried dumping it again, and same thing, even on a different computer..
<br />
<br />I can't imagine the EPROM itself acting up like that, unless someone screwed up on burning it in the first place?
<br />
<br />EDIT2:  According to this site, 131735 bytes does translate into 128KB..

<br />Aside of that, unless you get a decent dump it's hard to tell anything, I just noted a few strings that definitely are like the japanese Zelda, but that one won't run without SRAM.
<br />I think you should read your EPROM programmer's manual or something to see if the dump is correct. Are some tracks on the board cut and rewired ? This step is necesary to place a regular EPROM on a SGROM board, so this will telll if this is a regular EPROM or not.

(a wire from the other cap is going to where the missing one is..  i sure hope this won't damage my NES)
<br />
<br />As for circuit cuts and traces, they look mostly the same as this guys:  <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.raphnet.net/electronique/nes_cart/nes_cart_en.php">http://www.raphnet.net/electronique/nes ... art_en.php</a><!-- m -->
<br />
<br />(only for the program side of course..  in my case, the SG-RAM side is totally untouched)
<br />
<br />I would take a picture right now of the wiring on my PCB, but the damned camera is acting up (took me quite a few tries to get a picture of the top)..  it says the battery is full, then as soon as I press the shutter button, it says Battery Low and just shuts off...  I'll try and use my webcam later if I have too..
<br />
<br />EDIT:  Just to test that my EPROM programmer/reader is working, I put the ROM from Bionic Commando (the only other game I have that has the SAME exact SG-RAM PCB as this one), and dumped it..
<br />
<br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://blackevilweredragon.spymac.com/Bionic.bin">http://blackevilweredragon.spymac.com/Bionic.bin</a><!-- m -->

<br />I'm begining to think, as since Bionic, and this home-burned Jap-Zelda have the same PCB, perhaps the person used the Bionic PCB?

<br />they are NiMh..  they shouldn't have a memory effect, and when plugged into something else like a gameboy, they work fine..
<br />
<br />the camera has a faulty system, the company (Concord), was supposed to replace it, but they never sent out the box..

<br />
<br />Don't worry for the cap missing, it's only here to polish the power supply voltage. Now that I think about it I think your dump are wrong because the EPROM programmers doesn't take into account the MMC1 present on the board, possibly conflicting the adresses with the programmer itself for the upper adresses. So exept for NROM games, it's impossible to dump the cartridge just with an EPROM programmer and a flat cable with a tool that grip over the chip. Instead, you should have a copyNES or soemthing to sucessfully dump the chip, because the MMC1 controls the higher adress. Else you'll have to actually cut the traces on the board (and re-solder them after the dumping process ?) for the highest adress lines. The /CE line may be conflicting too, as the MMC1 has floating inputs so you never know what will be on it's output.
