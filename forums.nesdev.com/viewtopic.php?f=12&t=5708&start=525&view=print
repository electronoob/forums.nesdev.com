It's then up to the user to decide for themselves what <strong>they</strong> want.

The code needs to be changed to simply remove the visual presentation (i.e. printing of the directory) and that's all.<br /><br />So if your proposition is to make it do exactly that, then yep, fully agree that's the right solution.  :-)

Not only will v2.02 incorporate the proper acknowledgement of hidden files/folders, but it'll also be faster than previous versions. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />

Just add a &quot;hidden&quot; flag to variable <tt style="margin-left: 2px; margin-right: 2px; padding:3px; background-color: #3355aa; color: white;">tempEntry+$1B</tt>, bit 0 of which is the directory flag. Then, check this new flag in <tt style="margin-left: 2px; margin-right: 2px; padding:3px; background-color: #3355aa; color: white;">CardLoadDirSaveEntry:</tt>, skipping the entry if it's set. Don't forget to adjust the handling of said variable in all the mapper code (not just loader.asm) as well, since any <tt style="margin-left: 2px; margin-right: 2px; padding:3px; background-color: #3355aa; color: white;">cmp #$01</tt> will result in incorrect status bits if your new &quot;hidden&quot; flag is set at the same time.<br /><br />BTW, you would also want to add some means to detect whether <tt style="margin-left: 2px; margin-right: 2px; padding:3px; background-color: #3355aa; color: white;">CardLoadDir:</tt> was called for printing directory content to the screen, or merely for loading a system file, and disable skipping of &quot;hidden&quot; files in the latter case.<br /><br />Let me know if you need further assistance regarding the PowerPak boot loader's code structure/functions. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">tepples wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">As I understand it, it's slightly harder to reflash an NES PowerPak in-system because of how boot ROM write enabling is handled.</div><br />Hmm ... don't at least older versions of the cart have a socketed boot ROM, just like early SNES PowerPaks? Unfortunately, the only PCB shot I could find doesn't look like it:<br /><br /><img src="http://www.nespowerpak.com/powerpak.jpg" alt="Image" /><br /><br />Well, whatever. I don't own a NES PowerPak, so I can't really tell. In fact, I don't even own a NES. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />

I've added a compiler switch to easily enable/disable its usage, and would really like to disable it for the release. However, I fear this might cause many false &quot;bug reports&quot; about save files not loading, which you'd either have to load manually, or move from SAVES to your ROM directories.<br /><br />Any comments on this matter -- preferably from active PowerPak users like yourself -- are appreciated. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />

Was this necessary if I was starting from scratch or could I have started with version 2.1? (Using revH powerpak). I know a few people who own a powerpak and would like to pass this along.<br /><br />Looking forward to V2.02  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" />
