But even taking that into account, it is still merely a combination of features from my two favorite platformers at the time, not even an original concept.  A rather pedantic point, anyway - surely you don't agree that this example means a child has a better grasp on game design than an adult?<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"><br />If you try to be too original, people won't know what they're playing.

(TJ&amp;E in a sandbox style, PoF closer to Parappa.)  "Criminal sandbox adventure" isn't much of a genre, either.  Either it fits within "action/adventure" or you have to also allow the likes of Katamari and Noby Noby Boy their own genres as well.  Similar things could be said for Electroplankton or Flower on PSN, or the "fast-forward/rewind platformer" kicked off by Prince of Persia and continued by Braid and others.<br /><br />That aside, I don't think the creation of a new genre is a fair measure of creative success.  It's certainly a positive, but healthy originality is possible within existing genres.  A number of classic genres languished for years until they resurfaced due to creative new entries, such as what the Sims did for simulations, or the recent resurgence of adventure games like Sam and Max, or the broad appeal of World of Warcraft.<br /><br />I don't believe originality should be stressed above all else, but I believe that in many cases an adult's originality has a greater capacity for creativity than a child's, else we would see far more children as high ranking members of dev teams.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3438">UncleSporky</a> — Sat Aug 08, 2009 9:36 pm</p><hr />

I designed my own Mario game where question blocks would show the top part of their contents sticking out.  What a lame idea!  First of all I should've been more creative than to use someone else's existing game, and secondly that design decision ruins the fun, the mystery, of the question blocks.<br /><br />When you're a kid, you have dozens of game ideas, all of them pretty terrible.  As a teen or adult, it's true that you may only have two or three good game ideas, but you were able to recognize the difference between good and bad ideas.  You lose quantity and gain quality.<br /><br />But if you are actually arguing that you lose both quantity and quality, I cannot agree.  As a child my game ideas were all "Mario only better" or "Zelda only better."  Small modifications of existing concepts that weren't even very good game design.  Now I have the ability to create on my own, to flesh out new ideas.  My creativity has grown.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"><br />The 12 year old kids would typically come out with characters, enemies and story in a matter of minutes, which gives them the adventage over the adult man who has lost his immagination.<br /></div><br />An example of a 12 year old's character would be "NPC man #24," the guy who says "Hello warriors, I think you are great!"
