		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Something I would like to do someday is design my own game console using an FPGA.  Eventhough I'm a long way away from actually doing it, I do a lot of thinking and planning for it.  Since converting RGB into a NTSC is pretty complex I came up with a way of cheating.
<br />
<br />I call it the PCM color palette.  It works with a 10.53 Mhz video signal, every colorburst wave is 3 subpixels long, and colors are stored by the wave height of those 3 subpixels.
<br />
<br />When rendering the 3 subpixels at phases 105 degrees, 225 degrees and 345 degrees, you have a color space very similar to RGB only with a few differences, such as:
<br />
<br />Red (105 degrees), Green (225 degrees) and blue (345 degrees) would be of equal intensity .333:.333:.333 instead of .299:.587:.114, and some colors will be out of the RGB gammet.
<br />
<br />I guess you can compensate for the out of gammet colors by use of an artistically chosen hardware color lookup table, that prevents use of illegal colors.
<br />
<br />I made a picture of how a 6-bit PCM color palette looks like.  I'll post it when I get home.

<br />
<br />
<br />I google'd 2D Graphics chip....are these not really available anywhere? You'd think something like that would be still produced today and have a standard. :/ It must be one of those things replaced by software.....
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />This a really cool project. I was thinking of doing something like this but since I know nothing about logic of CPU's and volts and stuff, it's out of my capability, but still.....I want to learn all that one day and attempt this too. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /> A 2D homebrew system in todays world would probably be better then the NES, and maybe up to par with SNES! <img src="./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" /> Technology has advanced so far. It's scary!
<br />
<br />
<br />Oh well too much stupid stuff. I just get excited seeing people try this stuff. Good luck man! I can't wait to see what you come up with.

<br />
<br />Once the prototype is working, the problem will become one of attracting developers and one of making enough units of your console to ship to customers.

<br />Once I become a little older and more independent of my own money (I'm only 19 and living under my parents) I would take action.

<br />The Neo Geo's sprites are actually vertical strips of 32 16x16 tiles, with a different attribute table for each tile.

<br />
<br />Neo Geo's sprites have a join bit that joins the next sprite to side of the last sprite.  If you move one sprite, several sprites will move with it.
<br />
<br />On my FPGA project, I will have a regular join bit, and a tile-per-offset join bit that keeps the next sprite at the side of the last sprite, but uses it's own individual y-coordinate.
