		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Hey guys, you may know me from my youtube channel or my blog that I'm a big retro gamer. As I continue to write the top 100 NES games of all time on my blog, I got an email from a subscriber who suggested I start my own podcast. Thinking it over, I consulted my gamer friends for their inputs and asked around in various forums for some advice and well, I've decided to give it a go.
<br />
<br />I've produced this prototype episode of what may be a podcast. Before I create an itunes or rrs feed, I just want to see what people think and if I should actually bother to do this kind of thing. I'm thinking I'd do a bi-weekly (possibly weekly) podcast to begin with and see what people think.
<br />
<br />So with some feedback I've received I've tried to make this as good as possible, but keep in mind I'm new at this and find balancing volume levels difficult, but I did try my best. For now, please let me know your thoughts.
<br />

<br />
<br />Right off the bat I notice you have the same problem I do: trying to read &amp; sound natural. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" /> 
<br />
<br />You could adlib, but if you're like me (not a good talker) then this is <em>probably</em> not a good option.
<br />
<br />Actors have this same problem (&amp; they're not even reading!). You just need to keep practicing; it will eventually come.
<br />
<br />As for the sound mixing, I think it's okay. Some people might think the music needs to brought up more, but it's really up to you. I think it works as it is right now - it's not distracting.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Try applying some compression (as in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_range_compression" class="postlink">dynamic range compression</a>, not data compression) to the speech to even out the volume levels. Overall the speech part has much lower volume than the intro tune. Also the intro tune is too long, IMO.
<br />
<br />Good luck with the podcast.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />The Nerd did a "Behind the scenes" video about how he balances volume levels when he does his reviews.  He uses video editing software that makes it easy to separately do simple effects to multiple different audio/video sources.  He basically fades the game audio down while he's talking, and unfades it back up when he's done speaking.  Then when he stitches many clips of game footage together, he crossfades the game music so the cuts are less noticeable.
<br />He also mentioned that he forgot to do color correction when he did the "Silver Surfer" video, and is embarrassed about that.
