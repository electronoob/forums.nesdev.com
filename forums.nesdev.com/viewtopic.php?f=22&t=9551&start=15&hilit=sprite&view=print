This is with my TVs, other people's TV might get different results.<br /><br />Dithering can look different than what you'd expect, true, but at least it does not look epileptic and is simpler to code than flickering.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Ironically, since my laptop's LCD updates in an alternating checkerboard pattern, Macbee's flicker-based halftoning looks like a dither if I run it in an emulator on my laptop. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" /> I guess an actual checkerboard-dither would just defeat the effect entirely on this screen.<br /><br />Anyhow, I am personally not a fan of flicker techniques. Interlacing has always bothered me, and I'm glad technology is finally moving on from it. Funny that this thread about a 2-layer sprites demo that doesn't flicker or dither has become a thread about flickering and dithering...

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />In the case of 2-frame flicker, I actually prefer the static striping of my LCD TV to the constant shimmer of a CRT. I much prefer if a screen that isn't supposed to be moving isn't wiggling at all the edges. Of course, when things are moving you get those awful mouse teeth everywhere; for that I like what the CRT does better. Though, that's another thing about a halftoning technique via 2-frame, you lose coherence when the <span class="posthilit">sprite</span> has to move across the screen, unless you do your movements at 30hz too.<br /><br />Also, tepples, I wasn't suggesting you split the thread. I don't really like it when that happens-- I always find it disorienting.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />In that case, I'll use my backup plan of an attempt to swing the discussion back to the original topic:<br /><br />Layering can be seen in Battletoads (face), Mega Man series (face), and Super Mario Bros. 2 (eyes). It also causes flickering due to the NES PPU's 25% overdraw limit. So if flickering causes flickering, and layering causes flickering, it might be a wash.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />For comparison, the Game Boy allows 50% coverage, Genesis and Super NES allow close to 100%, and the GBA is close to 400% to 500%, depending on whether the flag for processing OAM in hblank is turned on, if none of the sprites on a line use matrix rotation. The overdraw terminology comes from discussions of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fillrate" class="postlink">fillrate in 3D graphics systems</a>, where the goal is to run the shader/compositor/whatever once for each pixel. I use percentages of screen width because they're fairer: 80 <span class="posthilit">sprite</span> pixels means something very different on a Game Boy with a 160px wide screen vs. on a Genesis with a 320px wide screen because the Genesis would normally be using bigger sprites anyway.

You could just say &quot;oh fuck all those BGs, I'll do everything with sprites&quot; and it can work well.<br />However if you used the <span class="posthilit">sprite</span> scaling or rotation, it would dramatically reduce the # of sprites you could display on a line - but it could still allow up to 10 or so.<br />Tepples could confirm or infirm this, because I'm just saying this by memory.
