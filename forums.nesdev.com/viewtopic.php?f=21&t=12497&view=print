		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I drew a sprite of an otter. It came out cute without outlines so I wanted to finish without outlines. Sadly, NES has only 3 colors for a sprite so I had to make outlines from the inside. I did it by applying the outline color onto the first pixel looking from left to right of the samecolored bodypart as the one overlapping it.<br /><br />Animating this will be a problem because of the bodyparts overlapping each other. I imported this into Paint.NET and turned things into layers and guess what? No outlines! I got no outlines! That's bad. Now I'm supposed to have each bodypart colored in a different color, animate the bodyparts, color them back into their initial colors, see the end of overlapping (mission impossible as it's all one color!), flatten and then insert into Fatilety.<br /><br />Is someone willing to animate my sprite for me?<br />Here's the sprite in BMP and CHR format: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/airllrhk99ju56q/OtterSprite.zip?dl=0">https://www.dropbox.com/s/airllrhk99ju5 ... e.zip?dl=0</a><!-- m --><br /><br />Warning: Don't start yet!

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Hey! That's a nice base design you've got there, but I can see how it would be hard to animate with so many limbs and a tail.<br /><br />Might I suggest using <a href="http://www.aseprite.org/" class="postlink">ASEprite</a> for your animation purposes? It's a fantastic pixel art program I've used for years, and it supports layered animation. And unlike Paint.NET, you can actually preview your animation, work in an indexed NES palette and have access to onion-skinning. You have to buy ASEprite to access all of it's features, but the <a href="http://www.aseprite.org/older-versions/" class="postlink">older versions</a> are provided for free and have all of the features I Just mentioned. And if you're not convinced, everything you see in my signature was drawn in the program.
