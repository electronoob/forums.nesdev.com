		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Hey All<br /><br />I attempted nes programming about a year ago with very basic programming skills.<br />I successfully got my name on the screen and could move it around with the controller.<br />But it took me days and a bucket of frustration.<br />Now after a year of learning C# at school, i'm really eager to try it again. <br /><br />I read you can program nes game using C at the cost of speed. (i'm fine with that. I'm not going to program anything fancy)<br />What do you guys think of using C? <br />Is it a good start or should i just go back and use assembly?<br /><br />so far i used this tutorial to get me started with using c <a href="http://www.dreamincode.net/forums/topic/152401-nes-game-programming-part-1/" class="postlink">http://www.dreamincode.net/forums/topic/152401-nes-game-programming-part-1/</a><br /><br />and this my code:<br /><br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">#include &lt;nes.h&gt;<br /><br />void write_string (char *teken)<br />{<br />*((unsigned char*)0x2006) = 0x20;<br />*((unsigned char*)0x2006) = 0x41;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;//put the &quot;hallo nes&quot; characters in name table 0 <br />while (*teken)<br />{<br />*((unsigned char*)0x2007) = *teken;<br />teken++;<br />}<br />*((unsigned char*)0x2006) = 0x20;<br />*((unsigned char*)0x2006) = 0x4f;&nbsp; //puts a 2 after &quot;hallo nes&quot;, Just expirimenting here.<br />*((unsigned char*)0x2007) = 0x32;<br /><br /><br />}<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />int main()<br />{<br />waitvblank();<br /><br />*((unsigned char*)0x2006) = 0x3F;<br />*((unsigned char*)0x2006) = 0x03;&nbsp; &nbsp;//white on 3f03<br />*((unsigned char*)0x2007) = 0x30;<br /><br />*((unsigned char*)0x2006) = 0x3F;<br />*((unsigned char*)0x2006) = 0x00;&nbsp; &nbsp; // blue on 3f00<br />*((unsigned char*)0x2007) = 0x12;<br /><br />*((unsigned char*)0x2006) = 0x3F;<br />*((unsigned char*)0x2006) = 0x02;&nbsp; &nbsp; // red on 3f02<br />*((unsigned char*)0x2007) = 0x16;<br /><br />write_string(&quot;hallo nes!&quot;);<br /><br />*((unsigned char*)0x2005) = 0x00;<br />*((unsigned char*)0x2005) = 0x00;<br /><br />*((unsigned char*)0x2001) = 0x08;<br /><br /><br />while(1);<br />return 0;<br /><br /><br /><br />}<br /></div><br /><br />now for my question: How do i select a background color?<br />I know i put blue on 3f00 witch means that even if background rendering is switched off it will show blue. Right?<br />But how do i tell the nes to make it's background red(f302).<br /><br />Thanks!

See my nes.h for some documentation but basically in your C code you put your sprite data in ppu_oam[], your palette data in ppu_pal[], and a list of commands to alter the background nametable (you can only do a little bit per frame, there is not enough time to alter a lot) in ppu_nam[], and when you're done you do ppu_send=1 and then call ppu_nmi_wait() to wait for the data to be rendered before you start your next frame (see coltrane.c for a working example).

That way if you take a long time to draw a screen, it won't take effect until you tell it to with ppu_send. NMI happens regularly at 60hz, but you're not required to make changes to the screen every time.<br /><br />If you're interested in the timing of your code, I made a function called debug_grey() which if you put just after your ppu_send=1 but before ppu_nmi_wait() it will show you visually how much time is left over in the frame before the next NMI by turning grey the portion of the screen that hasn't rendered yet. The PPU is constantly drawing the screen from top to bottom, over and over, at the same time as your code is running, so you can use it's current vertical position as a visual indication of timing.<br /><br /><br />Also, as an alternative you may want to look at <a href="http://shiru.untergrund.net/articles/programming_nes_games_in_c.htm" class="postlink">shiru's guide</a> for NES C programming. I dunno which is easier to use, mine was good enough for my own needs but I think shiru's might have more convenient stuff in it. (Also, yes, don't mix and match nes.h from my stuff and shiru's, they are entirely unrelated.)
