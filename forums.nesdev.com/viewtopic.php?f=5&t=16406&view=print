Inspiring stuff! I think I'm gonna buy it despite the huge price tag.<br /><br />I love things created by people 100% &quot;because they can,&quot; or &quot;because they wanted to,&quot; and for no external reasons whatsoever...like the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watts_Towers" class="postlink">Watts Towers</a>, for instance.

Like it would take an entire lifetime to play the darn game. <br /><br />Also I'd like to know how they programmed this. I'm pretty sure 20 years ago they didn't have all those fancy game engines.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />They probably had to update it to work on modern hardware several times, but it looks like they didn't change concept or graphics too much over the years.<br /><br />Wasn't it Duke Nukem Forever that had to be constantly updated because the game became to look outdated all the time due to the very slow development. On this one they didn't seem to care, and went for the retro-look instead.
