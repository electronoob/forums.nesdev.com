<br />Why would it not? It works on Nintendulator just fine, so chances are that it will work fine on the NES.

However, the translation that "looks the best" may be the most dangerous, because sometimes they change the code to do something look different, and at that point it become dangerous. Since they just change letter tiles and text, this is no problem.
<br />I had to hack FF2 transltaed to make sure it woks fine, but it wasn't hard to make it looks in Nintendulator what it looked in Nesticle. If it works with Nintendulator, then you're almost sure to have no problem.

<br />
<br />1. Plug EPROM programmer into computer and stuff
<br />2. Open EPROM program
<br />3. Insert EPROM
<br />4. Select which device you are using
<br />5. Move the switch thingys to match whats shown
<br />6. Choose what data to write to chip
<br />7. Write to chip
<br />
<br />I'm using Willem PCB3 software, if that helps. But as soon as it reaches $20000 on the chip, it says there's an error. Any reasons why there'd be an error like that? Low voltage? Wrong settings? What?

<br />
<br />So here's the scenario. Doesn't work. I don't know if it's my programmer, the game, or just me. I have never successfully put anything on to the NES ever. I've attempted like 5 times already, and I haven't done it yet. The EPROM was 100ns, is that not good? I have USB power only for my programmer, but it said it programmed it alright, and I compared the data from the EPROM with the PRG data for FF3, and they are apparently the same, no errors. But all I get is a blank screen.
<br />
<br />I think I should just find somebody that I can pay to make cartridges for me, because this is seriously making me angry. I have attempted many times, but failed all of them. I am sad now...

<br />Did you put a RAM chip instead the CHROM chip of the original TKROM card an follow all the instructions by drk314 to convert to TNROM ? Did you glue the pad for CHR /WR ? Did you make sure it has good contact ? I neved did that, I made only a FF2 card, becuase I just don't have any TKROM board to destroy. But I think glue a pad while being sure it will make good contact to the NES connector would be pretty hard.

<br />
<br />I just to put the english translation onto an FF3j cartridge, because no, I did not want to play it in japanese. I just split the .NES file with the copynes software, and burned the PRG to a 27C040. That should've worked in an FF3j cart, right?

<br />Anyway, you have to do some modifications. I don't know what they are, because pure TNROM rewiring isn't doccumented, due to the rare board (it is HVC-TNROM, right ?).
<br />So, if you just put another EPROM in the slot of a real FF3j rom, you have to compare the pinout of a NES 512kb PRG chip, and the pinout of your 27C040 chip, and rewire all pins that are different. If you don't do that, of course it will not work.
