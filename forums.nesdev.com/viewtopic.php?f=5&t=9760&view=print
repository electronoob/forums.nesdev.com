No only that, but the ones that looks mostly alike are a different vowel AND a different consonant.<br /><br />Those which are bugging me are :<br /><br />セ (se),  ヒ (hi) and と (to)<br /><br />コ (ko) and ユ (yu)<br /><br />フ (fu) and つ (tsu)<br /><br />チ (chi) and モ (mo)<br /><br />る(ru) and ろ (ro)<br /><br />ワ (wa) and ク (ku)<br /><br />and of course :<br />シ (shi) and ツ (tsu), and ノ (no) which follows a character with a dakuten, as in ベノ<br />ン (n) and ソ (so) and リ (ri)<br /><br />In the first cases they are close but there is a little detail that you should look out to know which character reads. But in the later 2 cases, there is really no way to tell AND there is 3 possibilities.<br /><br />The only conclusion is that japanese people are so racist they wanted to welcome to hell any foreigner who tries to learn their language.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Your list of similar-looking hiragana and katakana are pretty much (not entirely but almost) the same that I have trouble remembering.  You're not alone, Bregalad.<br /><br />I don't mix up katakana and hiragana, so the katakana fu vs. hiragana tsu situation doesn't really apply. <strong>However</strong>, you know what ones really chap my ass more than anything?  Youon / sokuon -- you know, ゃ / ゅ / ょ / っ, which are just tiny versions of their &quot;larger&quot; counterparts.  WTF.  Now throw dakuten into the mix.  Seriously WTF.  It starts to look like Arabic (which is really quite neat but hard to read/write for me).<br /><br />Japanese is one of the few asian languages which I wish I could truly read/write (and I'm working on that -- my neighbours consist of an American who professionally does Japanese translation for Nikon and his wife (who is Japanese), and they've finally agreed to try and help me with reading/writing) because of how often I see it used on a daily basis doing what I do.  That's why when I see non-Japanese who learn it, I'm amazed they can remember it.<br /><br />For me -- as someone who took 4 years of Mandarin in school, and a year of external studies as well -- I find Chinese a hell of a lot easier.  Sure, &quot;more lines&quot;, and traditional hanzi (Taiwanese) are insanely complex (ugghhh... shivering in fear...), but a 1:1 ratio of meaning-to-character makes things easier (for me anyway).  Grammatically Chinese is a lot like English (with some exceptions), so sentence composition is actually quite easy.  In fact, looking at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hiragana#History" class="postlink">original Japanese</a> I can see where they got their kana from (chart on right) -- still stole the writing and made a bloody mess of it though.<br /><br />If you want an asian language with an alphabet that's easier to learn, try Korean.  Seriously.  Walk in the park, and fairly logical.  Reading/writing Korean is a lot of fun actually, as the language was invented for simple farmers and thus had to be simple.  I'm talking purely about hangul (written), not about the language semantics when spoken (e.g. grammar, vocab, etc. -- that's a nightmare in the same way Japanese is).  I actually really enjoy reading/writing Korean.<br /><br />I have bits and pieces of familiarity with all sorts of other languages (Swedish, Russian, and some Afrikaans) too.  I really should have gone to school and become a linguist.  While I hate the complexities of languages (all of them -- and English is the worst), I find the cultural diversity and &quot;wow, humans sure are clever!&quot; aspect very neat.

Similarly, the two lines of ツ are made to be vertical-ish to intersect with the top horizontal part of つ.<br /><br />Here's a god-awful mspaint-on-laptop drawing I made:<br /><img src="http://mikejmoffitt.com/images/shitsu.png" alt="Image" /><br /><br />Furthermore, セ looks like a quick せ, helping link between Katakana and Hiragana, while ヒ looks substantially less so.<br />フ, being Katakana, is much pointier than つ.

In the past I remember Futurama, Alienware laptops, Commander Keen, J.R.R. Tolkien, and I'm sure there have been others I am forgetting. Many puzzle books make simple cipher problems this way.<br /><br />Actually, when I took Japanese in High School, our teacher introduced katakana by giving us a sheet of English text written in katakana, with a couple of starting hints, and giving us 30 minutes or so to try and decipher it ourselves before she began teaching them. It was a fun exercise.
