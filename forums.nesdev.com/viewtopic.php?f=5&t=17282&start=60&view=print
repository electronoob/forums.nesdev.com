		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />You have it backwards: CISC ISAs are as CISCy as ever. RISC chips have gradually turned into CRISC chips, in large part due to code density issues.<br /><br />Modern CPUs are *insanely* good at reordering, parallelizing, and fusing instructions together once they get inside the pipeline. Nothing - *nothing* - a CPU can do internally comes close, performance-wise, to the cost of hitting RAM. When writing tight code (at least on a first pass) I view branchless operations on registers as effectively *free*; my big concerns are always always always branch prediction failures and cache misses.

It's that the two ISAs provide different instructions and different tasks can be done in different ways. You wouldn't <em>want</em> to do that on 68k unless you were specifically writing an ARM emulator on the 68k.<br /><br />Comparing a single unique unchanging instruction speed is more or less useless in all contexts. There is literally no context in which that is a useful metric. (This is specifically why MIpS is a useless metric)<br /><br />8086 IDIV was abominably slow. But you wouldn't claim that the XT ran at 24KIpS as a result, that's just misleading.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Your point being?<br /><br />A Dhrystone is an arbitrary metric. It is less misleading than pure MIPS. It does not indicate suitability for other tasks other than those measured. It is definitely not a good metric of floating point capabilities, which are explicitly out of scope.<br /><br />Some things benefit from certain CISC features. (For example: 68k register autoincrement). Sometimes the simplicity gained in early RISC designs outweighs that. Sometimes they don't. But <strong>replacing</strong> the metric &quot;dhrystones/sec&quot; with the metric &quot;bounding box collisions/sec&quot; doesn't tell you more, it just tells you something different.<br /><br />The N64 has a very fast RISC CPU. And yet it is completely hamstrung by having high latency and limited bandwidth to main system memory. If you just counted operational cycles without paying attention to memory latency, you'd get a horrifically misleading picture.<br /><br />The earliest ARM CPUs were only used in Acorn's Archimedes, which had graphical capabilities somewhere between EGA and VGA, and sound capabilities comparable to the Amiga OCS. But when I look at the very  few demos that were posted to Pouet and viewable on youtube ... it doesn't even come close to its contemporaries. Is this a fair metric? Who knows, but on top of the other metrics, all I'm hearing is the same thing over and over:<br /><em>RISC promised us that simpler instruction sets were a key to performance. Other factors have always overwhelmed any resulting gain.</em>
