It's not like the motor of a toy car that has strain placed upon it. The GameCube is built like a tank anyway, and out of the three GameCube's I have, they all work like a charm. I hadn't even considered them breaking at any point. I think the most legitimate concern is the fact that the Gameboy Player seems to downgrade picture quality, but it seems that you can get a different rom to run it and it looks just fine. I'm not exactly sure how you'd get this rom on a GameCube disk though... Would there be some kind of way to burn information onto a disk using the Wii's GameCube disk drive? (It's easy to run custom software on it via the homebrew channel for this, if the software exists.) I've never really understood how burning a disk works.

I don't even understand how that could ever happen under normal circumstances... (The lid is closed 90% of the time, so nothing can even come into contact with the laser.) I was always led to believe that it was from the motor failing, which still seems fairly improbable, especially in only about 10 years with no strain on it whatsoever.

With the multi-disc games that exist we can assume that it was not capable of supporting them.<br /><br />I don't think the GC has a reputation for breaking down. Ofcourse anything can be broken by a careless or abusive user.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Well, the cheapest GameCube I found with all the cables and a controller was $40 (Even more expensive than the cheapest Wii I found. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_lol.gif" alt=":lol:" title="Laughing" /> ), and I found the Gameboy Player with the disk for $50, with the actual expansion on the console going by itself for $15 (The disk is where most of the cost comes from). If you were able to somehow burn Gamecube games, you could find the rom for the Gameboy Player (or even the improved one) and burn it onto the disk of some cheap crap game. I don't know feasible this would be though and it might be cheaper to just buy the regular disk. (although the modifications people have made to the rom certainly make it look a lot better, getting rid of the blurriness.) At worst, you're looking at about $90.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">MottZilla wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">Ofcourse anything can be broken by a careless or abusive user.</div><br />I've even heard some crazy stories of GameCube's surviving what would break just about any other console. This one kid told me his brother went crazy and threw it out the second story window by its lunchbox handle, and it still miraculously worked, although I can't imagine it looked to good. I don't know if this is true, but I did trip over the controller wire while my sister was playing a game and had the GameCube slam into wall (It was on the edge of the table, next to a wall. It fell of the table and hit the wall) and it still worked perfectly, (and isn't made out of stupid shiny plastic so it also still looked perfect) so it's at least that strong.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">MottZilla wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">dual-layer disc.</div><br />What does this mean? I this isn't a double sided disk?<br /><br />One random thing I was thinking of was that I've never understood the hate for the Gamecube's tiny disks, other than the fact that the Gamecube couldn't play DVDs although we always had a DVD player so that doesn't matter. People just always like to act like it's some sort of serious technical flaw even though you can just simply switch the disks and it acts just fine, as all the information is just dumped onto ram and stays there until it needs to be changed. (Some games I've played will even work fine without the disks in for a majority of the game.) One thing people seem to forget is that load times are often best on the GameCube vs. the PS2 and the Xbox, I think because of faster access times of something, which is also something that could potentially be useful even outside of loading, like rapidly changing graphics to try and avoid something like this: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34sU5DVIGMM#t=1m52s">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34sU5DVIGMM#t=1m52s</a><!-- m -->
