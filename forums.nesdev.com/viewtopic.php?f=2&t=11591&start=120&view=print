There are also some games that are console exclusive such as Red Dead Redemption, and other miscellaneous games that are locked to either Sony and/or Microsoft consoles, but not Nintendo's.

Look here:<br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.sega-16.com/2008/03/interview-al-nilsen/">http://www.sega-16.com/2008/03/interview-al-nilsen/</a><!-- m --></div><br /><br />I said it was part of why the TG16 failed. Never did I say it was the sole reason. Another reason I've read is that in Japan where the PC-Engine was very successful, NEC marketed the system in the bigger cities primarily. They thought they could do the same in the US by just marketing it primarily in the largest cities like New York. There are other reasons though like many games that were released for the PC-Engine did not get released on the TG16. Some may have been related to Nintendo policies. I'd have to double check but I think there are no US releases by Konami. Konami released Gradius, Gradius II, Salamander, and ofcouse Castlevania Dracula X on the PC-Engine. Also I think only 1 Sega title of a few on the PC-Engine got released here, Space Harrier I think. <br /><br />tomaitheous's PC-Engine NES emulation library is really impressive. I can't think of anything else like it. I remember working with one version of it to try to get I think it was Contra running on the PCE. I recall getting it working but it didn't support 8x16 sprites which were needed.<br /><br />Back to the topic, unlike the Sega Master System the PC-Engine should not be considered part of the same generation as the NES. The PC-Engine does belong with the &quot;16-bit&quot; generation of the SNES, Genesis, and I guess the NeoGeo can be thrown in with it too. There are lots of people that like to call it an 8-bit system as a negative remark or to group it with the NES. These people generally don't know much about how any of these machines work. If you look at the game library you can see it's way beyond the NES and SMS. If you just consider what it can do versus the NES it's also obvious that it is the next generation.

What the 68000 has over the 65C02 are fast multiply and divide (needed for certain physics and 3D calculations) and 16- and 32-bit addition as primitives (same). And though both have equivalents of a DMA unit, only the Genesis has hardware for compositing two background layers. And more RAM allows for more destructibility in levels; the stock TG16 is down there with the SMS and the original Game Boy in this respect, and I don't think it was easy to fit extra work RAM in a HuCard. Finally, some game designs need a third trigger button, in addition to I and II or C and B for jump and standard attack, that isn't as hard to reach as Select.

Personally, JRPGs are pretty much the life and blood of my gaming experience. I know Ys and some FF games are on Steam, but no Star Ocean, no Tales of XYZ, no Dragon Quest, no Rune Factory, no Kingdom Hearts, no Disgaea, and the list goes on for perpetuity. I love the fact that MGS5 is coming to Steam, since I have no reason to buy any next-gen console atm. If Square, Bandai-Namco, NIS, and Atlus went PC for even a fraction of their games, that would be the one thing to sway me in favor of PCs, and this is coming from someone who was playing the NES before 1 year of age.

The companies involved now might pull out if sales don't rival console sales or at least meet their own internal expectation. The last time I checked, Sony and Nintendo were still Japanese companies, and JRPGs make quite a mint over in Japan. It won't make or break the market, but It's not something (in financial terms at least) that can be ignored. On a western level, sure it's easy to dismiss it, but not necessarily in the overall view. At any rate, isn't arguing with internet fanboys pointless to begin with? Their denial of evidence is, at times, second to none.<br /><br />For the sake of maintaining the original discussion, for what it's worth, Wikipedia at least claims that the fourth generation essentially began with the PCE. Every other credible source I've seen seems to agree on that, though I'm willing to see contradicting sources. It doesn't surprise me that the TG16 was behind the Genesis given that the Genesis was partly a response to both the NES and the TG16.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I've never heard of the CreatiVision, but research says it uses a 2MHz 6502.  So how did that machine compare to the others, and the NES by extension?<br /><br />As for consoles over PCs, your essay nails most of the points, but misses a critical one.  Game availability.  PC might have dozens of tower defense games on Steam, but consoles will get whatever game marketing has hyped up as being the second coming of Christ, which is any game from Konami, Rockstar, or Square-Enix.  Those games will also not come to Nintendo consoles, and as a result Nintendo consoles are almost always supported by Nintendo's own games.  The GameCube got Twin Snakes, a remake of dubious quality of a 6-year-old-game, but it was a drop in the bucket when the PS2 got MGS3 a few months later, a game many people wanted to play.  No one bought a GameCube for a game they already played 6 years ago, but a lot of people bought a PS2 for MGS3, one of the most hyped games since San Andreas.  To say third party games don't sell on Nintendo consoles is a lie, especially when all the evidence consists of games that appear as if they were deliberately trying to sabotage their sales.

Getting into lengthy, irrational, impassioned &quot;discussions&quot; where the opposing side comes away as biased as before (or even more so) seems like something I'd want to avoid at any rate. It's certainly possible to meet fanboys that are well articulated and well-versed in what they believe, but those have been the minority in my experience, and ever so hard to find depending on the community and subject. I understand that talking about subjects when viewpoints differ helps strengthen your own position, certainly, yet arguing with some fanboys is a downright depressing experience.

PCs get their own second coming mega-games, just from different publishers. Blizzard games come to PC first and often only. And if Valve ever managed to count to 3, it'd be on PC first. These are the games that cause people to turn an office PC with an Intel IGP into a gaming PC.<br /><br />Anyway, for ColecoVision vs. CreatiVision, a 6502 clocked at <em>f</em> Hz is usually considered equivalent to a Z80 clocked at 2<em>f</em> Hz. So yes, a tie, except for marketing.

I mean, it's similar to the 68k in how you do more register-register operations, but it has quite a bit fewer of them. It seems crippling for its type of design. There were also some missing direct memory address modes that would have speed it up a bit. As far as easier to program for, maybe for beginners or new to the processor. But once you've gotten use to any of these processors - everything becomes easy. If you mean tedious, then that's something else. Some people find writing 65x code very tedious (the CLC/SEC, the Accumulator style arch, etc), but I find the same tedium in z80 code as well. The small amount of address registers on the z80, compared to the 65x, ~always~ annoyed me. <br /><br /> I did GBZ80 before I did 65x, and I found it (GBZ80) quite easy to learn right off the bat. When I jumped over to 65x... I though it was the weirdest thing I had ever seen (and I had done x86 assembly) <img src="./images/smilies/icon_eek.gif" alt=":shock:" title="Shocked" />  But that lasted all about a month, then it was like normal (as you can get for assembly). I did 68k after that, and it was breeze. I did v810 and PIC16xxx after that. 16xxx was a wake up call - <em>thee</em> worse ISA I'd ever seen. I decided never to complain about processor ISAs again. There's NO stack on that thing. Doing function calls is tricky. It can nest two or three of them max, outside of that you have to do a software stack - but the memory access and banking system make this a <strong><em>real</em></strong> pain in the ass to do. Certain logic is missing (flags and such) and so you have to write all this extra code to give back that functionality. And I don't mean just a few instructions either ;&gt;_&gt;

So the piracy ratio would be rather high given how few people actually buy games.
