I agree. I can't wait until the day we have 600ppi displays and no smoothing whatsoever is needed. Already, 300+ppi is sufficient to eschew subpixel rendering (although it's my understanding that OS X on a high density display still uses it, though I know no mobile OS does that supports arbitrary viewport rotation). I know that it's rough to pick up my crappy 1024x768 secondary Android tablet after a few hours of using my iPhone 5c and iPad Air. Apple devices really do have gorgeous screens with standard subpixel layouts.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=325">LocalH</a> — Fri Mar 13, 2015 8:15 pm</p><hr />

Thing is ... the more you increase the raw resolution, not only the more is subpixel aliasing a waste, but so is <em>full</em> antialiasing.<br /><br />(For example, I had a laser printer maybe a decade ago, that had a native resolution of 600dpi and they were talking about how awesome it was that they'd added greyscale antialiasing. I couldn't see a difference, no matter how close I held the page to my eyes.)<br /><br />The only real argument is about what is the right thing to do when you're dealing with a low pixel count letter form. All three options will anger someone (chroma error, blurry letters, or awkward kerning). Increasing total pixel count (such that we don't ever have low pixel count letter forms) means we can sidestep the entire argument.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3512">lidnariq</a> — Fri Mar 13, 2015 12:25 pm</p><hr />

If you don't have the power to render the whole screen you can usually render at a lower resolution and upscale. For example, most PS3 games running on a 1080p television, the picture was upscaled from 720p rendering (either by the TV, or by the PS3, depending on your settings/TV).<br /><br />Also, pixel rendering scales linearly, essentially (it's very parallelizable). If the moore's law estimate holds out, if you can do 1080p now, you should be able to so ~2000p in 4 years for the same price.<br /><br />So, even if you don't want to pay more for the pixel power, upscaling would still let you use the high resolution for low-refresh applications like text, and a lower resolution for games.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=5165">rainwarrior</a> — Fri Mar 13, 2015 12:05 pm</p><hr />

The problem with anti-aliasing of fonts is not that it makes the fonts blurry. The main issue that I have seen as a layman is that pixel density is too low on average. If you look at high resolution devices like Apple's Retina display or some of the high-end Android mobile devices, they have enough pixel density to anti-alias their fonts while still maintaining high readability, since the pixels are packed much tighter. It's a lot closer to reading a piece of paper than on a standard 1920 x 1080 monitor that only has 100 or so pixels per inch. Even on such a monitor, I prefer Mac-style unhinted, subpixel-enhanced rendering. It keeps the letterforms shaped as the typographer designed it, instead if hammering everything into the pixel grid.<br /><br />I will concede, however, that if one really likes their fonts aliased, then they must also be hinted or they will look like garbage. Trouble is, more and more fonts created today do not have the proper hinting information that the Windows renderer would need. As far as I know, only Windows and Linux have any real need for any type of font hinting. I know Linux gives you the freedom to turn the hinting on or off, whereas Windows does not. Meanwhile, the Mac was designed around unhinted, smooth rendering to look its best, so it's pointless to try to disable the hinting on a Mac. If you don't like font smoothing, then don't get a Mac, simple as that.<br /><br />Subpixel rendering is almost outmoded anyway. When you have over 300 pixels per inch, you don't really need to worry about subpixel rendering. You can't even tell the difference when the subpixels are that small, unless you have near perfect or better than perfect vision. I certainly can't. As pixel density creeps upward, eventually even grayscale smoothing will be outmoded. The gold standard is ink on paper, and we're already really close.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=325">LocalH</a> — Fri Mar 13, 2015 9:33 am</p><hr />
