		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />- I'm tracing the Just Breed CPU execution in order to get it working, but there's something strange. AFAIK, no available MMC5 docs cover the PRG RAM writes. Just Breed writes to $E000-$FFFF which is supposed to have PRG ROM data (writes not allowed). So, the writable range would be $6000-$DFFF.
<br />
<br />- 64k of PRG RAM means a bank ranging from 0000 to FFFF, but the maximum value written is 7F (80h=1 pages ROM; 80h=0 pages RAM).
<br />
<br />- Could someone clarify these things, please?

So, the writable range would be $6000-$DFFF. </div><br /><br />It's not supposed to be.  From looking at your log it seems obvious to me that the game is stuck in some kind of loop that is doing writes it shouldn't be.  Probably something like:<br /><br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">loop:<br />&nbsp; sta &#40;ptr&#41;,Y<br />&nbsp; dey<br />&nbsp; bne loop<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; dec ptr+1<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; bne loop<br /></div><br /><br />The problem is 'ptr' is pointing to garbage, and so the game ends up writing to $E000-FFFF (and even down into $Dxxx).  The writes to MMC5 regs in between there are probably done in IRQ or NMI or something.<br /><br />This is probably a PRG-RAM swapping problem.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">64k of PRG RAM means a bank ranging from 0000 to FFFF, but the maximum value written is 7F (80h=1 pages ROM; 80h=0 pages RAM). </div>
<br />
<br />No, 64k PRG-RAM means the banks range from 00-07.  Banks are 8k in size:
<br />
<br />bank 0 = $0000-1FFF
<br />bank 1 = $2000-3FFF
<br />bank 2 = $4000-5FFF
<br />etc
<br />
<br />PRG-RAM swapping is exactly the same as PRG-ROM swapping, except you swap around RAM instead of ROM.

<br />
<br />It depends what chip each 8k is on.  If the 16k is all on the same chip you use pages 0, 1 (AND page number with 1), but if they're on separate chips as is the case with Uncharted Waters, then you use pages 0, 4 (AND with 4)
<br />
<br />But if you just give every game 64k it doesn't matter how it's arranged.

<br />- The gfx is corrupt. Do you know if ExRAM as nametable is required?
<br />
<br />- Speaking of ExRAM, there are 4 settings. The first is to act as a nametable; the second to act as a nametable too, but each byte tells the attribute color and CHR bank used. The docs bring the info to stick with mode 1, but what's the difference? I get mode 1 as a "normal" nametable, a grid of tile numbers, and mode 2 as a special gfx enhancement.

<br />
<br />That's pretty much exactly right.
<br />
<br />Ex0 doesn't do anything special, it just lets you use ExRAM as a 3rd nametable.
<br />
<br />Ex1 uses ExRAM to specify CHR pages and attributes for individual tiles on the screen.  ExRAM is usually not used as a nametable in Ex1.
<br />
<br />Using ExRAM as a nametable in Ex1 doesn't make much sense because then you're trying to use ExRAM for two things at once (ExRAM is the tiles in the nametable, as well as the attribute and CHR page for those tiles!)
