I tend to think of consoles as referring to larger hardware you can hook up to a display, but it isn't as if I never owned any portables myself. I know people use the term handheld consoles, so the term &quot;console&quot; itself can be pretty broad, but I'll just keep my list separated:<br /><br />Gameboy Pocket (Gift from grandma)<br />Gameboy Color<br />Gameboy Advance (now has a cracked screen, but still good to go)<br />E-Reader (not really a different handheld per se, but I have one)<br />Gameboy Player (not really a handheld or a console, but I have one)<br />DS (the original &quot;fat&quot; one, which I find better than the Lite models)<br />Dingoo A320 (emu machine + homebrew games)<br />PSP<br />3DS<br />3DS XL (basically gave my 3DS to my sis, using this one for games + homebrew)

Wikipedia makes no distinction either, but almost everyone I grew up with never referred to the Gameboy or ever more recently the PSP or 3DS as a console. We've always distinguished them as home video game consoles and handhelds. It would be nice if we could say they were one in the same (video games) but realistically, ignoring the format of in which the games were made is also ignoring a large part of the game's design, style, gameplay, and history. If you don't take into account how and why portable games were created differently from games you were meant to play at home, you're missing out on how and why the game impacted the industry (or didn't for that matter). Pokemon is a great example. I find it hard to imagine Nintendo could have emphasized trading and battling (and making it a wildly and socially popular game in the process) if it had originally been tethered to your TV screen in a time essentially before the internet.<br /><br />Perhaps it's just because I grew up with portables around me all the time. I was very aware of their limitations in comparison to home video game consoles. The GB lagged behind the NES, and even when the GBC came out, the N64 was out. The GG lagged behind the Genesis. The GBA outpaces the SNES, but by that time the GC was out. It's only been fairly recently that I've seen the gap close in my mind (3DS feels like a portable Wii in many respects, and the Vita feels like a portable PS3) so that portables don't really feel like they're 2 generations behind in capability. But as a young gamer, the hardware differences were more than enough to make it seem like there were in fact two classes of gaming.

The Famicom has a disk drive and a keyboard. Is it the assumption that the console maker gets veto power over programs that run on a platform and developers that create them?<br /><br />The handheld distinction largely relates to two things: multiplayer, and how long play sessions are expected to be (5-15 minutes vs. an hour).

Computers and phones are designed for more general purpose uses, even if they have some hardware oriented towards games (and it shows not only in the hardware but also in the operating systems normally used with them).<br /><br />EDIT: also I noticed I never included Brick Game in my list...

It probably boils down to how much time people actually spent with handhelds and consoles (separately) and the types of games they played during what era.

I really don't think that the size/portability of a game system by itself determines what it can or can't do, there are several other factors (that are constantly changing) that contribute to this, so it's kinda silly to create a distinction based on the situation at a certain point in time, while games as whole can change drastically no matter the platform.<br /><br />I'm not saying I'm right and everyone else is wrong, but I listed my handhelds because to me these systems are all the same. I play games on them. Sure some of them have gimmicky controls, multiplayer features, but when we're talking about old shit, gimmicky controls suck and there are not enough people into them to multiplayer anyway, so it all comes down to playing single player (or multiplayer on the same console when friends come over) games with a good old D-pad and buttons.

But more often than not, the games on handhelds are going to be different from the consoles, due to nature of their hardware specifications. It may look stupid to you, but it's hardly uncommon. Saying &quot;games are games&quot; is a gross oversimplification that neglects to take into account of host of factors that were considered when that game was made (who would play it, how they would play it, when they would play it). Those things are all very important to consider, especially if you have a mind for studying video game history, like I do, or if you just like playing all kinds of games, like I do.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">tokumaru wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">but once we're talking about several generations of gaming hardware, there are handhelds insanely more powerful than consoles, and this distinction becomes completely irrelevant. They all play games of different levels of complexity.<br /></div><br /><br />And that's along the lines of what I said earlier. Handhelds aren't as far behind as they used to be. Just look at the New 3DS playing Xenoblade Chronicles for a Nintendo-based example. But that's only because handheld technology has finally caught up in terms of hardware. You can probably thank ARM for pushing and various mobile GPU manufacturers for that. But leading up to current generations, the gap was obvious enough for a lot of people to merit that distinction.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">tokumaru wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">But there's much more to it than just these two extremes.

Arcade games easily create another category in my mind. So it's not black and white, &quot;handheld, console, or nothing&quot;. It is most certainly not a case of two &quot;extremes&quot;. <br /><br />There are still general design choices that are really only specific and applicable to console games such as enhanced screen size, greater storage capacity more often than not, constant power supply (goes in hand with the ability to drive better hardware for a given generation), same-screen local multiplayer, and centralized saved games (largely a console-only advantage when the PS1 showed and until the PSP showed up, the 3DS has yet to catch on with that idea though). It doesn't matter what kind of accessories or additional, innovative things home consoles (or handhelds for that) added to the mix; there are concepts inherent in home consoles themselves that dictate different design choices in games.<br /><br />If you're still in doubt, I'd suggest a quick google of &quot;handheld or console&quot; and you'll see that (as I posted earlier) it's actually common to distinguish between home consoles (as just &quot;consoles&quot;) and handhelds. Perhaps that will change in the future (thank you convergence) but for now and in the past, it's valid to see them as separate. I have no problem with people saying home consoles and handhelds are all just consoles, but it looks really weird to me not recognize that the games between the two have historically been developed differently. Personally, I just can't imagine a commercial developer jumping from the SMS to the GG ever saying something along the lines like &quot;we never took the reduced screen resolution into consideration.&quot;

I was never one to buy cutting edge consoles (the only one I got in this situation was the Genesis, all the others were already outdated when I got them), so generations never meant much to me. When I played Mega Man on my Game Boy, it felt the same as playing pirate Rockman on my Famiclone. It didn't feel any different.
