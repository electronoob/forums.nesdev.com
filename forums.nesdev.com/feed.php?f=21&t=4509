Or in a platformer, you could have Up to jump like in Street Fighter and Smash Bros. Or neutral+B to shoot gun and direction+B to shoot hookshot. If you have a Wii, try some Brawl to see how it makes the most of the sideways Wii Remote, which behaves a lot like an NES controller.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=9">tepples</a> — Mon Dec 29, 2008 8:54 am</p><hr />

I'm just wondering how your game is progressing. <br /><br />I stumbled upon this thread, and I have a suggestion for the control scheme. I'd say take a page from the kunio games.<br /><br />B = shoot<br />A = bionic arm<br /><br />B + A = Jump<br /><br />I think it would make the gameplay a lot sweeter to be able to do this on the fly without the need of a toggle...<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3776">FranMichaels</a> — Sat Dec 27, 2008 11:44 pm</p><hr />

Earthworm Jim 2 doesn't have this crouching problem because the Snott Swing is only supposed to be used in the air.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3329">strangenesfreak</a> — Sun Nov 02, 2008 7:26 am</p><hr />

One idea I had but didn't know how well it would have bode is when you press select, you would activate the "bionic boots" (... kept the bionic commando theme in mind). When the boots are activated, the colors of the boots changes to tell the user that you're now in jump mode.  In that mode, you can use the bionic arm and jump.  If you need more precision, you just deactivate the boots.<br /><br />It all depends how you would use the arm in the end thought.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3559">Banshaku</a> — Sun Nov 02, 2008 6:53 am</p><hr />

Programmers should absolutely avoid using start and select during gameplay if possible. It is extremely difficult to reach those buttons while playing on a real controller.<br />Select for pausing is a real lame. Start was the button meant for pausing in 95% of games, and still is today on modern PS2 and DS games (probably other modern consoles I don't have as well).<br />I hate how Batman have Start for switching weapons and Select to pause. They really should have made it the other way arround : "Start" is to pause and start the game, as the name implies, and "Select" is to select between different modes, in this particular case weapons (altough many games, including the one I'm programming, doesn't use that button at all).<br /><br />Only A and B should be used for gameplay features. If that's not enough programm for another console, or make a special controller for the NES with more buttons that is included in your game pack (will be hard to emulate).<br /><br />So in conclusion, I'd consider select for toggling between arm and gun may be allright, but will still be ackward. I'd recommand just B for gun and up+B for the arm. This should work the best.<br />Of course if up is reserved to climb ladders, this will make it impossible to use the arm close to a ladder, just like it's impossible to throw a special weapon near a stair in NES Castlevania games.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=38">Bregalad</a> — Sun Nov 02, 2008 2:46 am</p><hr />

I actually was thinking the same thing about not planning based on what people will use as their emulator settings, even though I think most people will play this on an emulator. One major thing is that I'll be supporting a left-handed controller setup where the player can actually flip the controller upside down to have the D-Pad on the right and the buttons on the left. Though I may just allow for fully customizable controls, where if you want, up can be walk right, and B can be "access menu" instead of jump or attack, etc.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=138">Celius</a> — Sun Nov 02, 2008 12:47 am</p><hr />

Hrm. Both options are a bit awkward, but I think using Start as a toggle is the least awkward of the two.

That's what <em>Mike Tyson's Punch-Out!!</em> does, and it works beautifully.<br /><br />For people who prefer to use START as the pause button, I might offer a second control type that swaps the SELECT and START buttons.

The player is likely to fire the gun much more often than he launches the arm, so I think it's acceptable to launch the arm using a slightly less convenient button.
