<br />
<br />- Jump physics seem OK to me. You might want to add friction to walking, though, so that when player releases the movement key the character doesn't stop immediately.
<br />
<br />- Here when the character jumps up the stairs his legs don't move at all which looks unnatural: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HFqWBYEh_E0#t=0m45s">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HFqWBYEh_E0#t=0m45s</a><!-- m -->
<br />
<br />- Also it seems that the camera position is fixed to player position. You might want to have a little window in the center of the screen where the camera doesn't scroll.
<br />
<br />- It's the mediocre graphics that give it this "colordreamy" feeling. Of course it's understandable from a one-man project.
<br />
<br />- The main weapon, sword or whatever is too short range to my taste. I like projectiles. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />
<br />E: Let me just add, that when you can kill enemies by jumping on them etc, it's also fine. I just hate when the only option is a very short range weapon.
<br />
<br />- It's sometimes hard to immediately see what parts of the background are walkable... especially at the castle where the color scheme is pretty consistently grey all-around.
<br />
<br />- All in all, very good one man effort!

<br />Tokumaru might know of one <img src="./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";-)" title="Wink" />
<br />
<br />But consider that Mega Man 1 had slide to a stop, but none of the later Mega Man games had it.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Nice graphics and music, the game looks pretty interesting.  The attack style made me wonder if it could benefit from downward and upward-stabbing attack (like Zelda 2 or Rastan), that's always fun.  But that leaves the question open on how to handle enemies that take more than one hit to kill (bounce off or pass through, or how to not make it a suicide technique).
<br />
<br />The music I think could use a little improvement with the volume envelopes, I kinda thought it was the NES hardware envelopes until I heard the fade-in (the fade-in timing in particular gave it a de-synchronized feeling).  The songs themselves sounded nice though.  Especially keep in mind that NES volume levels are linear, while perceived volume levels for humans are logarithmic (perhaps this why the NES hardware envelopes sound overly loud and boring).  Very commonly you'll see volume envelopes look like : 15, 9, 6, 5, 5, 4, 4, 4, 3, 3, 3, 3, etc. to compensate for that.
<br />
<br />Nice progress though, pretty impressive to see as it is.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Sorry I hadn't responded to some of the posts above previously---I think I was reluctant to spam the main forum until something like this forum was created. (feels more appropriate now). @tepples, as far as I know the jumping is newtonian. It produces a nice arc if you move horizontally.
<br />
<br />@memblers, thanks. Thanks for the tips about volume envelopes, I definitely intend to improve the sound at some point.
<br />
<br />Also, I've started a brief series of dev videos for fellow nesdever's to see if interested. Links will be posted in the top of the thread.

<br />
<br />If I recall correctly, I can remember dying a lot because of that effect on "Gimmick!" 
<br />

<br />
<br />The game looks really good! What I most like about it, its the feeling of cohesion I get from it. It really looks like a game, and that's something hard to achieve.
<br />
<br />Good work!

<br />
<br />    Would you like us to demo your game at the MGC?  We'll have a few powerpaks and we will nuke your ROM image when done.  It probably isn't feasible to show your entire game.  Do you have a build that contains just the first level?
