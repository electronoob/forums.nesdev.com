It would work with Munchie Attack, with the minor (and kinda frivolous) exception of the way the title screen scrolls into view.  64 tiles is just enough for it.  Cutting cost down by a couple bucks, one less chip, and less soldering, that's great.  It's totally perfect for making NSF carts!<br /><br />Wish I had known about it when I made my UNROM board, it could be rewired easily but the only bad thing is it'd be like the first Garage Cart where I'd have to cut a notch in the cart case so it won't smash the wire to the edge pin.  I'll definitely keep that in mind if I ever revise the PCB.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=10">Memblers</a> — Sat Jan 13, 2007 10:23 pm</p><hr />

'VRAM' is a synonym of 'CHRRAM'.<br /><br />On my understanding, the adresses on PPU bus are NOT the same as acedded from $2006, acutally A13 is toggled for some reason. So, $0000-$0fff become the name table space, and $2000-$3fff pattern table space. /CE is usually active low, but on some 8kb SRAMs there is a CE active high input, so I don't know.<br />To use 4-screen mirroring, you could just lazily put some 32kb RAM chip on the cart and leave CIRAM /CE high. That will get 8kb of CHRRAM and 4 name tables in the same chip. The PPU will never write or read anything in the range $1000-$1fff, so I think it's okay. If you wan't CHRROM, or if you just don't like being lazy and wasting the power of chips, you can use a '139 style decoder to get your own 2kb chip used for nametable 0 and 1, and the CIRAM chip for the nametables 2 and 3 (or any combination in that style). I think some '00 NAND gates can do the decoding also.<br />The typical way official carts does it is keep a whoel 8kb SRAM chip on the board (like for CHRRAM), but just have A13 disabling it instead of /A13. Also, it's a good idea to put A12 to ground instead to A12, because you never known when $1000-$1fff could be acessed (there is palette RAM mirored in $1f00-$1fff, remember, so it would be bad to have anyother device on the bus at that time).<br /><br />Actually, there is thousands of other possibilities. You could get funky 3-screen mirroring, or do nametable bankswitching, or use CHRROM as nametable data, or whathver. Anything is allowed, since the cart has acess to the whole CHR bus.<br /><br />You could even have a cart with no CHROM nor CHRAM at all, and have only ROM. If you tie for example CIRAM /CE to ground and CIRAM A10 to CHR A13, you'll definitely get one screen mirroring and no opportunity to have more than one nametable, and have 1kb of CHRRAM mirrored 8 times trough the pattern table. That would only allow 64 tiles to be used at one time. This could be done for very plain games on a cartridges, and prices could be lower by this technique to have no CHR chip at all !<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=38">Bregalad</a> — Thu Jan 04, 2007 7:38 am</p><hr />

I mean, you have to be able to read memory over $1FFF, but the mapper takes care of mapping it to below that space. Is that correct? I'm asking because the pinouts of the CHR chips found on the nesdev page say that /A13 is conected to the chips, even the larger ones.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=95">tokumaru</a> — Tue Jan 02, 2007 1:23 pm</p><hr />

I believe /A13 gets inverted before entering the CHR chip as /CE.<br /><br />The cart can disable internal VRAM by forcing VRAM /CE high.  Normally CHR /A13 is passed untouched through to the NES as VRAM /CE, but a cart can filter this behavior when the PPU address is within a certain range.  I think some carts disable internal VRAM completely and maintain all 4 nametables in 4K of VRAM loaded on the cart.<br /><br />I see no reason why you can't use a larger CHR-RAM chip to hold nametable data along with CHR data, as long as you use proper address decoding.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=360">dvdmth</a> — Tue Jan 02, 2007 9:26 am</p><hr />
