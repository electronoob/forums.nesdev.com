<br />bootgod, feel free to use those scans in the DB, if you'd like.

Supposedly there are Camerica carts that have the auto circuit as well with no switch though I have not seen one.
<br />
<br />I saved the pics, I'll get them up eventually... don't really have a good way for doing accessories yet, but I have others ready for posting as well so it's on "the list"

<br />I vaguely recall seeing one of these before.  Couldn't find one in my personal collection, though it may have been something my brother once owned.  He used to collect Camerica stuff.

<br />
<br />I wasn't aware that there was an "automatic" version of the aladdin.  Mine also has the switch on it and is the same version as the pics posted.  How does the automatic version work?  I see an N channel FET on there and some caps/diodes.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Hmm and I thought mine was common version. I never traced it out or anything, but note that on the 2.0 one also has a PIC chip on it which I'm guessing does the work. Both my toasters already had CIC disabled when I got that, so I don't know how well it works compared to methods used by other carts.
