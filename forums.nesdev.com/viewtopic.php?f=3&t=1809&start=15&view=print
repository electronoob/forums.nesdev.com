		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I'm not sure how anyone will ever succeed in enhancing/modifying/replacing the iNES format when you can't even convince people to stop using Nesticle.  The fact is that people are set in their ways and won't change even if a vastly improved alternative (such as the Metric system over the current US measurement system) is provided.  If it ain't broke, don't fix it.
<br />
<br />If it's true that the next GoodNES version will (finally) resolve bad header issues, would that not reduce the problem substantially?  I won't say it will disappear completely as most issues like this never get resolved, but at least the more major ROM sites will finally be providing playable images.
<br />
<br />Granted, there are a number of ambiguities in mapper designations, but these only affect a few games (relative to the number of games out there).  Similar ambiguities have to be resolved by emulators for other platforms as well.  I recently looked at the SNES header spec (Nintendo's own header, built-in to the ROM image), and its coprocessor field does not provide enough information to distinguish between all types of coprocessors (near as I can tell, there's no way to tell from that field whether a game uses the DSP-1, DSP-2, DSP-3, or DSP-4).  Emulators resolve this by looking at the game's title and/or checksum.  Granted this information is built-in to the header, but what prevents an NES emulator from looking at the name of the ROM file (in today's day and age, how often does the name of a ROM file not contain tthe name of the game itself?) or from calculating a CRC like Nestopia does?  Frankly, I fail to see the difference between these approaches.

<br />I fail to see the distinction between CRC checks to correct headers, and CRC checks to correct ROM quirks (like Megaman 3's sloppy enemy select screen), or even CRC checks to correct emulation issues.
<br />
<br />All of them should be avoided.  In my mind they're all sloppy hacks.
<br />
<br />The ROM file all by it's lonesome should contain everything the emulator needs in order to run it successfully.  Just like all the NES needs is the cartridge.  The emu shouldn't need to have pre-existing knowledge of X or Y obscure games and have to look specifically for them and perform internal tweaks in order to get them to run -- that's bullshit.  In fact... emus which did this initially are partially to blame for the bad dumps and improperly headered ROMs out now.  If all emulators just emulated and didn't try to be an all-in-one fixitup tool, we wouldn't even have this problem.
<br />
<br />
<br />I especially dislike CRC checks because they will only work on a specific dump, and will not work on ROM hacks or translations.  Also there's the very very slim chance of CRC confliction... but odds of that are probably in the realm of statistical impossibility.  At least with runtime logic checks (like a few I layed out in that other thread), the checks are more generic and will run any game unless the game specifically <em>tries</em> to "fool" the emulator.

<br />The NES needs more than a cartridge unless you like looking at title screens all day. The emulator needs to know whether to enable a light gun in slot 2 (Duck Hunt), a dance pad in slot 2 (World Class Track Meet), a potentiometer in the expansion port (Arkanoid), etc. That info would normally be on the label of the cartridge, which is not present in an iNES file.

You either store the info in an open database that all emulators use and is easily upgradeable to the latest version (possibly even make the emu have an auto update feature ala Firefox), or you stick it into ROM image headers. Either way, it's just extra info that runs the game. You stick it in the ROM, now you get to try and convince 50% of the NES userbase that still thinks NESticle is "good enough" to replace all of their ROMs. Not. Gonna. Happen.<br /><br />A ROM image is just that, a copy of the ROMs on a PCB. Sticking cart information into a ROM image is as hackish as sticking it into a database is.<br /><br />Insisting that a database leads to game specific hacks is stupidity. I could just as easily claim all emulation leads to piracy, and school dances lead to pregnancy. If someone wants to add hacks to their emulator, they will do it -with or without- a database. The database won't make it any easier for them at all. AT ALL. I've heard <em>three</em> respectable emulation scene people cite this exact reason and it's completely absurd.<br /><br />As for ROM hacks, you can simply advocate soft patching, as we should all be doing in the first place, and then check the CRC against the database prior to patching. In the event someone modifies the game so greatly as to require a new mapper to run, then you fall back on the updated header approach.<br /><br />I don't get why this has to be one way or the other, period end of story. The best thing to do is everything you can to eliminate your current problem: shitty old iNES headers. You do both, and then when one gets to be accepted by the majority, you go with that.<br /><br />The DB has advantages, too. You don't need to have your userbase upgrade all of their ROMs, ROM sites don't have to update their content, you no longer have the 16-byte size limitation so you can store all the info you want in the DB, and then some. Collision problems are stupid. Store an SHA512 hash if you're worried about that. Nobody will even be <em>able</em> to make a collision in that for the next 3-5 years, at least. You also now don't have to worry about accidentally patching in wrong info into a ROM header, or missing a field you find out you need later on. The database is self-correcting and much easier to update than updating all ROMs everywhere.<br /><br />And so does the ROM header upgrade idea. It's more flexible for ROM hackers to take advantage of, for one.<br /><br />Either way, you need a database. Either to use directly in emus, or to make the ROM scanning tool that patches all of the headers. Why not agree to make the database now, and <em>then</em> bicker over which method is better, and let each emu author choose what they want to do?<br /><br />EDIT: thought this was an amusing point to reference here as well.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">I wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">pagefault, Nach and Disch oppose the use of a database because it "encourages adding game-specific hacks to correct emulation bugs".

<br />
<br />Since it's the user who plugs those controllers into the NES, an accuracy-at-all-costs emulator would require the user to manually command it to plug in a particular controller. You could even plug in the wrong controller for a particular game and get the same effect you'd get on a NES. In essence, the user is left to manually configure the NES hardware for these particular games, so it's definitely not part of the cartridge.
<br />
<br />As for where to draw the line between a NES emulator and cartridge files, an important side-effect of the location is the legality of the emulator. I imagine that an emulator with a built-in database of commercial NES games (or built-in functionality for one, like GoodNES) would make it much more susceptible to legal issues. It seems best that the emulator incorporate as little as possible outside the NES control deck hardware. The biggest exception to this is the behavior of mapper hardware, which would be quite hard to specify entirely in the NES cartridge file without imposing a significant performance penalty on the emulator. If we accept that mapper behavior will be stored in the emulator, everything else can be stored in the NES cartridge file.
<br />
<br />I think it's unfortunate that people deal with "ROM files" rather than "cartridge files", as the latter is a better idea. Why would you just want the data in the ROM of a cartridge, rather than that plus the wiring information and other behavior? There's nothing hacky about representing this other information in the cartridge file; it's just your standard encoding of information in a machine-readable format.
<br />
<br />I can see the use of a database in automatically filling in the cartridge hardware information when someone uses a cartridge dumper so they can play the game on their PC. People experienced with the hardware can ensure that the database entries are correct, and (presumably) distribute this information without infringing on any copyrights, since it'd contain things like "Wizards &amp; Warriors, mapper = AOROM" or whatever. Combine this database with a dump you make of your own cartridge and you have enough information to play it on an emulator, either by building a self-contained cartridge file or letting the emulator do the equivalent of this internally.
<br />
<br />I think I have to agree with byuu's central point that a database is the main thing to build. A nice side-effect is that the file format need not be set in stone, since a programmatic interface can be provided with insulates the emulator from the particulars. An emulator could locate an entry based on the name or various checksums, then find what mapper it uses, how big the WRAM is, etc. The user might want to be able to use multiple databases from different sources, in case one is more reliable but doesn't cover as many games.

<br />Unlike ZSNES, bsnes is proprietary software. It's the same reason people still use Sendmail and Postfix: even if qmail is higher quality software, they object to <a href="http://cr.yp.to/qmail/dist.html" class="postlink">qmail's license</a>, which resembles that of bsnes. To many users, proprietary software has zero quality, solely by virtue of its being proprietary.

<br />If we are going to seriously consider revising the iNES format, I second the general request for a sub-mapper number. I also support increased use of UNIF and iNIF for tricky games when appropriate.
<br />
<br />I would like to add another mapper variant to the list of cases under consideration. It concerns MMC2, specifically the fact that the PC10 version of Mike Tyson's Punch-Out!! uses battery-backed WRAM to save high scores. Some pictures of the PCB were posted in <a href="http://nesdev.com/bbs/viewtopic.php?t=1538" class="postlink">this thread</a>.

<br />
<br />Instead of extending the reserved bits, I think it'd be better for authors to agree upon new mapper numbers. Perhaps duplicates and useless mappers could be the first to be replaced.

<br />Everyone is entitled to their opinions. My code is plenty free. Free to use, free to distribute, free to obtain full source code, free to modify for personal use, free to submit any contributions to the source back to me for inclusion in the main branch.
<br />I do not believe in forking, thusly this allows a unified project working toward one goal: emulation.
<br />End users share the benefits of all contributions in one emulator. They aren't forced to choose between bsnes, bsnes Ultra XD SP, UO bsnes PP SE (unofficial) ++, etc. to get the specific options they want.
<br />I also have no intentions of competing with someone who rips off my code, changes two things, and releases their own "version" claiming it to be superior.
<br />And ultimately, I don't want someone hijacking and ultimately taking lead over my project because they added a few nice features and have more time than me to work on even more features. See Xorg.
<br />You want to compete with me? Make your own emulator, just like I did. You want to collaborate and make the emulator better? Please do, I accept source contributions from anywhere. You want to release your own binary despite all of that, such as <a href="http://bannister.org/software/bsnes.htm" class="postlink">Richard Bannister is doing right now</a>?

If iNES were to be unofficially revamped and Nesticle "broke", wouldn't that be all the more reason for them to move up? If they bitch, why should anyone here care?</div>They wouldn't break: older emulators (are supposed to) ignore the reserved bits.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">Instead of extending the reserved bits, I think it'd be better for authors to agree upon new mapper numbers. Perhaps duplicates and useless mappers could be the first to be replaced.</div>That would create incompatibilities between iNES header revisions. Besides, 256 possibilities can be too little.
