I will take a better look at the code, but since the split points in your demo are fixed, are you manually adjusting them or can the code dynamically move the split point?<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">You can get as many split points as you need, provided they're spaced at least 9 or so lines apart.</div>
<br />Another thing to consider is that it's not possible to have an IRQ fire at the very top of the screen... but I guess that in you could just check for those cases and use timed code instead.
<br />
<br />I don't know if it's clear, but I just want to make sure that this technique can completely replace a standard scanline counter. Even if a bit of timed code is necessary to fine tune the splits, all types of effects should be possible, right?

So you could have the NMI compute two additional values: on which IRQ to activate a split point, and how much extra time after that IRQ to wait before triggering the split. Then instead of switching to slow mode on the second action, the second IRQ would check for the calculated split IRQ count and then wait for the calculated time.
<br />
<br />Multiple splits would have to be spaced at least 9 or 10 lines apart, unlike MMC3 which can go as low as 2.
<br />
<br />When I first thought up this technique, I was just hoping to get <em>one</em> split in so that I could display tiles from the first pattern table in the top half of the screen and tiles from the second in the bottom half, so that I could <a href="http://nesdev.com/bbs/viewtopic.php?p=62669#62669" class="postlink">fill the screen with text</a>. I exceeded my own expectations.

<br />
<br />I'd like to make some experiments using your idea if you don't mind, is that OK, tepples?
<br />
<br />I just thought that since we know how many cycles are there between IRQs we could maybe request IRQs using cycles, not scanlines (like some mappers do), and every IRQ we subtract the known number of cycles from the total, and when the remainder is less than the time between two IRQs the rest of the time is spent with timed code. Does anyone have a better idea?

<br />
<br />Other than this, it's really great. I saw that it was possible to avoid completely sprite #0 hit if you have a cycle-timed NMI which can be an interesting alternative as well. It's really a great discovery you made, even if the "trick" to have an IRQ fire after one byte of DMC and count the time until it triggers is simple, you just had to think about it, and congratulations for that.
<br />
<br />Maybe you can't have splitpoints to close apart, but anyways if that were to be the case you could use timed code instead (without wasting too much CPU cycles), so it's not an issue. Scanline IRQ can be definitely considered luxury.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I'm thinking of something like this:
<br />
<br />The programmer can specify the number of scanlines until the next split, and the exact time this is done in the scanline is the time the split will happen, but X scanlines down.
<br />
<br />Use a frequency that will result in one byte of DMC finishing playing in slightly less than a multiple of 3 scanlines (to avoid fractional cycles - which means it will have to be a multiple of 16 in PAL?), so that when the IRQ fires it's timed to set up the next one at exactly the same point in the scanline, causing the IRQs all to fire with a whole number of scanlines between them.
<br />
<br />Each IRQ checks if the number of scanlines left until the split is less than that number of scanlines between IRQs, and if so it uses timed code until the desired scanline (a small function that waits X scanlines shouldn't be hard to code).
<br />
<br />Theoretically this would allow splits to be very close to each other, since the system would detect that the number of scanlines (as low as 1?) was smaller than the number of scanlines between IRQs and would use timed code instead. What you can't do is have 16+ split points evenly spaced across the screen, or there would be no time left for game logic.
<br />
<br />Not as good as normal mapper IRQs because more processing time will be spent on a series of IRQs before the actual split is reached, but is still infinitely better than sprite 0 hits. Also, the more the IRQs are spaced, less time will be spent before the split, but more time will be spent by the timed code that waits for the exact scanline, so we must find a healthy compromise.
<br />
<br />I'll have to try this whenever I get the time.

<br />Also, tepples, did you test your demo on hardware? I'm asking because even though it works with Nestopia and FCEUX, with Nintendulator there are some nasty glitches and the thing doesn't look stable at all.

<br />You are right, it works in the latest beta build. Apparently this version also has an IRQ firing when the 1-byte sample starts, like the other 2 emulators... Should I assume this is the correct behavior then?
