		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />There's no good way to counteract the overall dimming effect of scanline darkening beyond increasing the monitor's contrast control. The full range of each color component is already being used, so the only way to make things brighter would be to multiply by a factor &gt; 1.0 and clamp things that hit maximum value, resulting in visual degradation.

My computer is a laptop, so no CRT-style brightness control... I know exactly what you're talking about, so I'm going to modify my question: What contrast setting did you use <a href="http://nesdev.com/bbs/viewtopic.php?p=16427#16427" class="postlink">in this screenshot</a>?

<br />
<br />That's odd; the Macs I've used that have flat-panel displays all have a brightness slider in the control panel.
<br />
<br />As for the screenshot, I should have figured someone would ask about the settings. I'll have to look at what I did tomorrow. If I remember correctly, I used the <a href="http://www.slack.net/~ant/libs/ntsc.html#snes_ntsc" class="postlink">latest snes_ntsc</a> with snes_ntsc_composite settings, resolution and sharpness at about 0.20, and then interpolated the scanlines and darkened them by 12%. The ZSNES team seemed to be having some problems with their general filter architecture when they originally added the NTSC filter, and didn't seem ready for the latest version when I e-mailed several months ago, so they're probably still using an older one that lacks the resolution control. bsnes does use the latest version, so it'd be a better one to experiment with.
<br />
<br />Oh and in case it's confusing anyone, yes, I used the SNES filter for a NES image, because both filters do the same thing internally. The NES filter does the additional step of converting NES palette values into RGB colors, while the SNES filter accepts RGB colors directly. Since the source image was already RGB, it was simpler to use the SNES filter.
