<br />
<br />I have already sold 5 kits for this and I haven't even announced it.  Soo, looks like things will be moving pretty fast.  
<br />
<br />If you want a kit or parts or PCB or whatever, check out the page and email me with what you want and where you live and I will calculate shipping for you and tell you how much it'll be.  Once payment is recieved, I will ship the goodies.
<br />

But are you making a separate RAM cart for each of those mappers, or are you making a new cart PCB that will use multiple salvaged mapper ICs on the same RAM cart?

<br />
<br />Yeah, 1 board that can accept 3 types of mappers, but only 1 of them at a time.  The main reason being there's no way to multiplex them.  So, no biggie, you just need to buy 3 PCBs. hehehehe

<br />
<br />It can, if you modify your Fami to NES converter and put 560 ohm resistor in series with each data line.  Then the conflict is averted 'cause the cart can't "win" the fight, so to speak.

<br />
<br />Nope, the converter still works fine for all carts.  I always use my adultered converter when playing and dumping games.  What I did was pretty simple- I just lifted the pins of the fami connector up off the PCB with an x-acto knife as I heated the solder up.  then I got 8 560 ohm 1/4W 5% resistors and soldered them from the pins of the connector to the pads on the board.  I think I snipped them off a board.  The leads were super short but this was fine and was desireable for this job.  It's worked great for every single cart I've thrown at it.
<br />
<br />A couple times, some Sachen carts in the usual NES form factor were screwing up and crashing CopyNES (no licensed or 3rd party carts had ever done that) so I simply plugged my NES to fami converter into the adultered fami to NES converter and all was well <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":-)" title="Smile" />  Even though the cart was sticking way out why I was done, it worked.  I've chained no less than 3 converters before when I had the FDS RAM pack plugged in and that worked fine also.

<br />
<br />Meaning you removed this function from the PCB design itself or in the software?
<br />
<br />Is it still possible to incorperate an LCD display into the current CopyNES design? Even if one would have to tap signals or sources from components on the CopyNES PCB itself.
<br />
<br />Thanks.

<br />
<br />The place on the PCB is still there if you feel the need to mount an LCD connector and hook it up.  The code still drives it technically.  It has a 14 pin connector outline made to take a 2 by 7 pin header for a 14 pin ribbon cable to the display.  Pinout matches an LCD.  Note that the LCD's ENABLE line is being used for flash ROM carts... this won't affect anything of value though.
