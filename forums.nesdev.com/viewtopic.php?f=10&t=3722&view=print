<br />I've read a tutorial here and there, even read a bit of x86 ASM, but i'm affraid i'm not too creative and really don't know where to go next. i have hardware docs saved to my HD and would really like to learn how to write code to manipulate this stuff through an emulator with a ROM.
<br />i've done some of GBAGUY's tutorial but i've been told that there are some things there that are inaccurate(no offense) and i shouldn't use it. but no one suggests anything else(ok i'm sounding like i want to cry aren't i?) so what should i do next? i have nesasm (from magic kit) and i'm ready to rock <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />

<br />
<br />honestly a bit of both. as far as the technical aspects go, i'm having trouble remembering all those hex/binary numbers. is that what it's all about?
<br />it's quite confusing.
<br />
<br />and i haven't written anything besides some stuff from GBAGUY's tutorial since i bereley understand whats going on <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />

<br />Let your assembler remember them for you. Instead of
<br />
<br />lda $2002
<br />
<br />do
<br />
<br />PPUSTATUS = $2002
<br />lda PPUSTATUS
<br />
<br />Some assemblers may require a different syntax for defining constants; consult its documentation for more. Any tutorial which doesn't make use of this basic assembler feature is seriously deficient, because it puts an unnecessary burden on the learner. It's far easier to remember that PPUSTATUS holds the current PPU status, than it is to remember that $2002 does.

<br />good(but still fairly advainced <img src="./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" /> ) point <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /> i guess i should be more worried about writting than hacking at this point? besides. my metroid ROM has different values than the one parasite is using in his tutorial and even if i put them in to match his, i'm not getting the results his tutorial is saying i'm supposed to get...

Yeah, NESASM is not very good once you've learned everything. However, it's great for beginners, because there's not much to learn about the assembler. If you set it up like GBAGuy does in his tutorials, then you should be fine, if you're doing quick little tests to learn about the technical aspects. Once you start getting into bigger things like games, you want to be able to have things like nameless lables, and something that will allow something other than mapper 0, and 2 PRG banks.

<br />
<br />alright. well looks like i should just go back to GBAGUYs stuff for a while.
<br />thanks for the info. i'll be back soon(i hope )

You come into the world of programming with no idea of what is actually easy or hard, and once you master the 6502, you'll move on the other languages to find that it's actually pretty easy. If you learn what's hard first, everything else will appear easy. But if you learn what's easy first, everything else will appear difficult.

<br />
<br />I've found that people thaat start w/ a high-level language never really knows how a CPU works.  Knowing ASM means knowing how to think like the computer &amp; comes in handy later when doing high-level stuff.  I'm not saying 6502 is a good starting point, I'm just saying it's a plus if you're planning to be a better programmer...

A person who dives into ASM directly sure can learn it and code programs that work, but they'll probably start with really messy code (because as long as it works - or seems to work, which is worse - everything is fine), and will take longer to mature as programmers.<br /><br />I'm not discouraging anyone... I know it can be frustrating looking into something else if what you really want is to make NES games. But a person will hardly be able to program a complete game without any previous programming experience. The documents out there will explain how the hardware works, and also some small pieces of code, but that's just 1% of what making a game is.<br /><br />I know what I know about game logic today because I started writing crappy QBasic games back in 1996. QBasic was a very simple way to make a game, it was simple to experiment with, while 6502 ASM and the NES sure are not.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">I'm not saying 6502 is a good starting point, I'm just saying it's a plus if you're planning to be a better programmer...</div>
<br />I agree that every programmer should have some contact with some form of assembly language, even if just to understand better how computers work.
<br />
<br />But working with high level languages greatly improve your programming skills, because you learn to program by obeying rules and making much better structured programs. Object-oriented programming is also a great concept for games. And those concepts can sure be applied to assembly programs, so that they're more well structured too.
<br />
<br />So yeah, everyone can try. And I'm very happy to hear the stories of you guys that were able to get into programming with the NES, you prove that it's possible.
