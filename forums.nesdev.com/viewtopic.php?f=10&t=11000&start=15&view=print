		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I think Rainwarrior is right about FDS SMB, but given the very little bit of work needed with the regular cartridge ROM I don't think it's worth it to mess with the FDS version. The FDS version would require hacking up the FDS BIOS a bit. <br /><br />Also some FDS games, I know Druid does, do write to addresses between $8000-$DFFF like RAM. I think the Aliens prototype writes to the area as well.

SMB has a comprehensive disassembly, but most other games do not.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I decided to take 45 minutes out of my day and write a &quot;trivial&quot; FDS to FME-7 conversion kit. Instructions are included in the readme. Full source is included.<br /><br />You will need Nintendulator, the cc65 toolset, and probably a hex editor (I used XVI32), and also a suitable FDS file and the requisite DISKSYS.ROM to run it.<br /><br />I tested this on an FDS of Super Mario Bros, of course, and it seems to be running just fine.<br /><br />I dunno if there's much reason to convert FDS to FME-7 in general, DRW's request is a bit unique (especially since the INL boards can be set up for NROM anyway), but who knows, maybe somebody else will find it useful? Perhaps it's a good starting example that could lead to a more complex FDS to FME-7 conversion that could allow for some FDS repros using INL boards in their FME-7 configuration.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Something I was working on that was a bit of fun: I was able to get SMB running with mmc3 and placed the demo routine in its own bank with converted data from a FCEUX TAS for the demo playback. I never quite got it working properly though, and would lose sync in world 1-3. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" alt=":(" title="Sad" /><br /><br />I found it was easy to make room in the default 32k program space by looking for a couple routines that are called only once or twice and moving them to a different bank and patching calls to those routines with appropriate bank changes. (Didn't read the thread carefully, sorry if that was already discussed.)
