		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Thanks. So it would in theory fit in a PowerPak's 512k/512k RAM. In fact, the mapper matrix on <a href="http://www.retrousb.com/product_info.php?cPath=24&amp;products_id=34" class="postlink">the product page</a> says 228 is supported, which is possible for CM2 but not for A52 due to A52's oversized PRG ROM. Who here has tried CM2 on a PowerPak?
<br />
<br />And even if it doesn't work, we can still narrow down the possibilities among other mappers implemented on PowerPak that support this combination of ROM sizes: Does this game <ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha"><li>bankswitch CHR ROM rapidly (meaning mid-frame, or otherwise such that blanking for a split second isn't feasible)? </li><li>use the 16 KiB PRG mirroring mode? </li><li>depend on the four RAM locations at $4020? </li></ol>

<br />Caveman Games also used the Multicart approach to game implementation.

<br />Even if the powerpak couldn't do it, there is no way someone would want to play this game expet to laugh at how bad it is. How doing it on real hardware makes it a different experience ?
<br />
<br />Sorry but the $200 it could get you to sell it as the real deal is the only reason I see to make a repro of this game.

<br />To eliminate all sorts of [female dogging] about the quality of emulation, leaving the game itself as the only possible source of frustration.
<br />
<br />On NES = not having to squint at a tiny monitor, buy an HDTV, or figure out that VGA to composite converters exist.
<br />On NES = not having to use a keyboard or an overly loose USB gamepad.
<br />On NES = no control lag.

<br />
<br />The actions of many collectors don't really support your argument. Very few people can afford Stadium Events or the Nintendo World Championship cart, so they purchase (a) near-perfect reproductions (like the 'April Fools' SE) (b) versions from different regions (PAL SE) or (c) obviously different reproductions (e.g., the NWC red carts from retrousb). Not to mention collectors buying NES reproductions of Famicom carts.
<br />
<br />Many collectors are happy with symmetry and completion vs. accuracy. 
<br />
<br />And it's odd for you, an NES developer, to ask why someone might want to play on real hardware...

I'm sure more people do that in the collecting community than you'd think. How many bids do NWC's get? And even the SE stuff?
<br />
<br />But I guess the A52 is a bunch of NROM games with 8KB of CHR. Is there any catches to that at all? Because that should be simple enough just to slice in 32KB chunks until you hit the end.
