OK Tanks a lot.<br />The problem would be the inacuracy of this on Nester and VirtuaNES (the sprite-only status bar would take for sure 8 sprites somewhere, so it will be turned off too early : the BG will be shown between the status bar and this would be not readable).<br />Is there any other way to turn on BG mid-frame without any IRQ trigger ? (100% timed code would probabily not be possible in VBLank).<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=38">Bregalad</a> — Wed Feb 02, 2005 1:50 pm</p><hr />

AFAIK:<br /><br />Sprites are checked to see if they're "in range" every 4 cycles in the scanline (I would assume sprite 0 is checked on cycle 0... sprite 1 is checked on cycle 4, spr2 on 8, etc... but it might be in between).  When the 9th is found... the flag is set <strong>and remains set</strong> until the end of the next VBlank (when this bit and the spr0 hit flag are cleared).<br /><br />So the exact time and scanline depends on which sprite is the 9th to be found.  So if the 9th sprite is the 9th to be found (which would be the case if sprites 0-9 are all on this scanline), then the flag would be raised around (9*4) cycle 36 of the scanline.  But if sprite 52 is the 9th, it'd be cycle (52*4) 208 of the scanline.<br /><br />Also keep in mind that this is done on the scanline <em>before</em> it's actually rendered.  So if all these sprites are to be drawn on scanline 6... the flag would actually be set X cycles into scanline 5.<br /><br />That's how BT's doc suggests it, anyway.<br /><br />I do it this way in my emu.  But as already mentioned... most emus probably don't bother even trying to get the exact cycle right.  YOUR only concern, however, should be whether or not this works on the real thing... which it would if done right.  If you plan on going down this route... don't rely on ANY emu for testing since they're probably all unreliable -- get your rom tested on the real thing and leave it up to the emu authors to make their thing work right (and a ROM which tests this sort of thing and relies on its exact behavior would be a <em>fantastic</em> tool for emu developers).<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=33">Disch</a> — Mon Jan 31, 2005 5:44 pm</p><hr />

<div class="quotetitle">Hyde wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"><br />Don't count on that. Most of us, emulator authors, don't know exactly when to set the sprite overflow flag. So, take that into account.<br /></div><br /><br />That's true, good point. Although, I'm sure just because they don't know exactly when it occurs, it was ignored in their emulator (think about not allowing horizontal scrolling because of not knowing when to load the h-scroll counter, course that's exaggerated as horizontal scrolling is vital). I  have tested quite a few emulators and ALL of them (aside from Nesticle LOL) set this bit when their are 9 sprites on scanline (although their actual implementation is incorrect in a lot of emulators, they all set the bit when their are 9 or more sprites on a scanline) so Bregelad's scrolling will work fine using that.<br /><br />Some emulators handle this oddly though. VirtuaNES and NNesterJ miss the first scanline it should be triggered on + trigger it on &gt;= 8 instead of &gt;= 9 and they also reset it when their is not &gt;=8 sprites on a scanline. Nestopia goes crazy and sets at weird times midscanline (seemingly random times not based upon anything) + resets the bit when there isn't &gt;= 9 sprites on a scanline instead of resetting it later (I've forgotten when *exactly* to reset it, but it occurs after the end of the current frame that it was set on). So even though some implement it innaccurately, they still implement and it will work as desired on them all for Bregelads "demo?" FCE Ultra and Nintendulator emulate it just fine (as far as I know).<br /><br />When do you set it? It seems to me like it should be set in the HBLANK prior to the scanline as thats where all the sprites are evaluated and such for the next scanline. Hyde, do you have an emulator somewhere (curious)?<p>Statistics: Posted by Guest — Mon Jan 31, 2005 3:21 pm</p><hr />

<!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://nesdev.com/wiki/?page=bus+conflicts">http://nesdev.com/wiki/?page=bus+conflicts</a><!-- m --><br /><br />That should explain to you what a bus conflict is. Many discrete logic mappers suffer from them (the ANROM at least protects against this  using a 7402).<br /><br />Basically, the PRG-ROM chip is connected to CPU /CE (A15 (to enable the chip only the $8000-$FFFF) AND M2 (so that it's only enabled at the right times). Well, when a STx $8000-$FFFF activate A15 and thus it enables the chip. So the chip outputs it's data based upon the address lines and such although the CPU is actually writing, the 2 outputs then collide and one them will overpower the other producing "corrupt" data. But if the data on both ends is exactly the same then theres no problem (and that's why you *must* have them be the same).<p>Statistics: Posted by Guest — Sat Jan 29, 2005 7:29 pm</p><hr />

When you want to change a bank you'll have to write to the same space as the rom, which will cause the ROM to also output a value. <br />Bus conflicts appears if the CPU and ROM outputs are different, like if the CPU writes 1 and the ROM 0. That will cause an unknown result.<br /><br />The simple way to fix that is to have the same numbers stored on the ROM where you write, just like you explain.<p>Statistics: Posted by Guest — Sat Jan 29, 2005 4:06 pm</p><hr />

I'm unable to found a doccumentation explaining how works bus conflicts on a CNROM (and UNROM) cartidge.<br />The data written to the mapper (into $8000-$ffff) shall be the same than the value stored at the same adress in the ROM, right ?<br />So for a fixed swapping value would be :<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">lda #$01<br />sta *-1 ;I'm swapping bank 1 and the target stored data is #$01 &#40;the above instruction&#41;</div><br />And the only way to do variable swapping is :<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">jsr GetSwapByte ;A=bank to swap<br />tax<br />sta SwapTable,X<br />rts<br />SwapTable:<br />db $0, $1, $2, $3 ;Data to swap is the same than the target's value stored here</div><br />Is that all right ?<br />I also founded this information in MegaMan's rom tech doccument :<br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"><br />There is one more thing to note about this mapper: although any address<br />in the $8000-$FFFF range can be used to access the mapper, most games<br />prefer to use the address with the last digit equal to the value they<br />write out. Thus, $07 can be written to $9FF7, $05 to $9FF5, and so forth.<br />The reason for this is unknown.<br /></div><br />This would mean, for me, that the value written shall be the same than the least significant nybble, and may not be the same as the stored value in ROM.<br />Thanks in advance.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=38">Bregalad</a> — Sat Jan 29, 2005 1:35 pm</p><hr />
