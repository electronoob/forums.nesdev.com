<br />Could this behaviour be "emulated" just for fun? <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":-)" title="Smile" />
<br />What's the technical reason for graphics becoming corrupt? Does a dirty connector "scrambles" the data to become something else or does not transfer any data at all (perhaps both?).

<br />
<br />The most mysterious thing was that I had a game (it was Battletoads &amp; double dragon I think) freeze whenever I hit the TV (and I was able to repeat it a few times cause I didn't believe it at first). This is completely unexplainable rationally, but I think the hit somehow affected the CHR lines' connexion and prevented a sprite 0 hit.

In Tecmo Bowl I encountered a debug mode where it displayed a memory dump in hex on the screen.  In Tecmo World Wrestling, during a 2-player match, the background color blue became black (making the ring black) and only the triangle channel was playing music, all the others were silenced.  But I forget if it crashed or went back to normal after that match was over.

<br />This is a bug, not a bad connexion. What blarg says happened to me a couple of times, without a doubt due to a connexion on the PRG side that suddently stop to work.

<br />
<br />Same thing happened to me, but it was Final Fantasy, and just moments before fighting Chaos.  It even erased the save!  I hope no one ever emulates the wagging dog tail reset.

There was a hair or something in the cartridge connector and games would frequently power up to a blank screen, and erase the saved games in the process. I think I've gotten it clean, as it now works fine all the time.
