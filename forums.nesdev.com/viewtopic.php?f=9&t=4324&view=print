		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Okay, so I am very close to having my TSROM cart working.  I have some problems that I am just confused regarding the wiring (once again). 
<br />
<br />So basically the cart turns on and I hear sound, but the graphics are scrambled (so CHR wiring issue there) but then after a short time the game freezes up.  So I'm guessing I have an issue with both the CHR and PRG wiring. 
<br />
<br />The game is a TSROM MMC3 cart, and I have used the cutting traces method.  Both of my EPROM chips were burned correctly and verified, and my ROM was split properly (I've done this before and had several carts work).  I searched the forums extensively, but have still not found my solution.
<br />
<br />Here are the TSROM instructions (I have used CUT traces):
<br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">TKROM &amp; TSROM (mapper 4):<br />PRG socket:<br />Bend up pins 1, 2, 24, 30 and 31 (or cut tracks 2, 24, 30 and 31)<br />Solder pin 2 to hole 24 (A16)<br />Solder pin 24 to GND (OE)<br />Solder pin 30 to hole 1 (A17)<br />Solder pin 31 to hole 2 (A18)<br />CHR socket:<br />Bend up pins 1, 2, 22, 24, 30, 31 (or cut tracks 2, 22, 24 and 30)<br />Solder pin 2 to hole 24 (A16)<br />Solder pin 22 to hole 31 (CE or CHR /A13)<br />Solder pin 24 to hole 2 (OE or CHR /RD)<br />Solder pin 30 to hole 1 (A17)</div>
<br />
<br />For the PRG, I have made all of the connections except for the one that says to solder pin 30 to hole 1.  Since I didn't cut any trace for hole 1, what am I supposed to do with these points?  Still solder them together?
<br />
<br />For the CHR I have the same problem, what am I supposed to do with pin 30, since there is no actual HOLE 1?
<br />
<br />I should note that I soldered pins 31 and 32 together on the PRG chip and thats when I started getting sound, except the game freezes after a short time.  
<br />
<br />Also, I can't find any data on what CHR /RD means.
<br />
<br />Thanks very much!
<br />-B

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Update:
<br />
<br />In both cases, I just wired pin 30 to A17 (pin 1) for the CHR and PRG and I got the game working.  There are still some minor scrambled graphics going on, but not really during gameplay.  I also have to insert the cart a few times before it works without being all scrambled, so it also may be the contacts.
<br />
<br />So basically my only real question now is: Is it okay that I have the PRG pins 31 and 32 tied together, and is this always necessary when doing a TSROM cart?

<br />For 128kb/256kb EPROMS pin 31 is PGM, which should be tied to VCC, so the answer is yes.
<br />For 512kb EPROMs, however, pin 31 is A18 during reading, so you sure shouldn't tie it to VCC else you won't be able to read 512k of data.
<br />Pin 1 is always VPP and it really doesn't matter where it's connected (altough I don't recommand letting it floating).
<br />Pin 1 is wired to A17 on NES board initially, and I don't know if it matters if VPP is connected to A17, it probably does nothing anyway.
