I also think some chinese dumper has decided to label as Mapper 168 some Subor board, despite the overlap with Racermate... but I still have to better check the dumps since it would not be the first wrong header I find <img src="./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" />

This is a sanity check to make sure the second test is reliable.<br /><br />Then it repeats with [$C000]←0.<br /><br />BootGod obligingly tested for me. The former provided a count of 120 (as expected, give or take), and the latter provided a count of 241. So it appears that MC-ACC acts like MMC3C in this regard.

At the very least, we need to explicitly call out MC-ACC, but I'm torn as to whether we should explicitly call out anything else.<br /><br />As far as I know, everything else can be emulated as an MMC3C, so theoretically everything else can just be the default behavior. Would it be useful to have a submapper to mark games that explicitly require the MMC3C? How about ones that are known to run correctly on both MMC3A and MMC3C (effectively &quot;someone's looked at this game and verified it&quot;)?

I don't think SRAM packaging is the issue.<br /><br />It seems practical for selecting MMC6 as a mapper to force a 1k PRG-RAM size, but that's precisely the opposite of what I am opposed to. A mapper dictating a PRG-RAM size is okay. A PRG-RAM size dictating a mapper is not.

Mapper + submapper should unambiguously select a mapper implementation. We should not have to look at other fields or resort to other heuristics to pick a mapper. For this reason, MMC6 needs a submapper allocation.<br /><br />Are you asking about the other MMC3 variants because you want to add other mapper 4 submapper allocations and you're trying to keep the list &quot;pretty&quot; by putting MMC6 at the end? The iNES mappers don't have any logical order. The submappers allocations will grow organic and ugly as we discover new things. This is just a given. If you want to add it now, fine, do it (obviously nobody's had time to implement MMC6 as submapper 4 yet <img src="./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" />).

Do they likewise need unique submapper numbers?</div><br />I am not familiar with the details of these boards. It sounds like you're saying that they're similar boards but designed for different ROM/RAM sizes and end up having enable/write registers in different/mutually-incompatible places, that don't actually matter for extant game compatibility? Or do they matter? Is a heuristic currently being done (e.g. CRC check) to choose an implementation or are emulators just not implementing the unnecessary features?<br /><br />I'd say that a submapper assignment for these things wouldn't hurt, but at the same time if all extant games are compatible with some &quot;mapper 1&quot; subset, I wouldn't really expect anyone to implement it or use it any time soon. So... sure if you want, but probably doesn't really matter if they get an assignment or not. Do it if you need it, I guess? I think submappers can be allocated as needed. We don't need to come up with a big complicated specification where it's impossible to tell which parts are important. If someone needs to disambiguate a mapper to get something to run, let them allocate it. Same deal as if someone comes up with a new mapper. Theoretical mappers and differences aren't important, but if someone publishes software that needs it, let them allocate it.<br /><br />MMC6 affects two very well known, popular games. There is really no reason for a new homebrew to target it instead of MMC3. The only new use for it is modifications of Startropics or its sequel. Given how popular they are as games, it would be unsurprising if there weren't more hacks of it in the future. I was looking into this myself, because I wanted to resolve the issue of my own Startropics hack not running on some emulators, but I was dismayed to find that even the emulators with &quot;NES 2.0&quot; support did not have a consistent/proper way to identify MMC6. That's the practical issue I'm trying to solve here. Nestopia does one thing, puNES does another, Nintendulator does a third, and I think it's largely because the specification is unclear. I think a submapper allocation would make it extremely straightforward.<br /><br />We should be able to just look up a mapper from a table, using only the mapper and submapper numbers. There should not have to be extra code to check this-or-that other field. Yes it's true that MMC6's only practical use is if you want 1k PRG RAM. It should always be accompanied by a 1k PRG RAM specification, but that's not how a mapper should be selected.
