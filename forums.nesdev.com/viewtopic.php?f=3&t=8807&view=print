<br />I'd like to know your MMC3 IRQ implementation, since it passes through all the tests. I want to know about PPU A12 rising:
<br />
<br />a) how do you threat A12 for sprites 8x16? FCEUX doesn't clock the IRQ if PPU $2000 AND $38 != $18.
<br />b) how do you handle the IRQ for the cycle 324, regarding the <em>previous</em> scanline? (assuming no timestamp system)
<br />c) do you clock the IRQ at PPU cycle 260 with A12 high, if BG=$0000 and SP=$1000? (read <em>a)</em> again)
<br />
<br />My old code fails for the scanline timing test, "scanline 0 IRQ should occur later/sooner when $2000:$08".

<br />Hi Zepper, I'have tried to implement MMC3 in the simplest way possible (for me). Control each time the PPU address is updated if there is a transition 0 -&gt; 1 of A12 and if this happens then I tick the MMC3 counter. The control is always done (even in case of sprite 8x16). The only limitation that I have imposed is that the tick can happen only once between cycle 324 (previous scanline)/255(next scanline) and only once between cycle 256/323. For the cycles 324/255 the PPU rendering must be turned on. Maybe it's a bit slow, but it works. I hope that I managed to explain properly but the English is not exactly my strong point.

<br />
<br />It looks like an endless race for MMC3 IRQ. Disch's doc for map4 mentions only two cycles (or dots): 260 (sprite fetch) and 324 (BG fetch). I did a look into other source codes, but most of them have hacks, tons of hacks, so I gave up.
<br />
<br />If the sprite is set to 8x16, the tile could be fetched from $0000 or $1000, depending of the bit 0. Here's my info:<ul><li>The PPU address (of fetching data) is high at <strong>dot 260</strong> if there's the default setup: BG at $0000 and sprites at $1000. If it's the reverse, it happens at dot 324.</li><li>It's possible to clock the PPU address (of scrolling) by reading or writting $2006 and $2007, after increasing or resetting it (loopy_t = loopy_v), but such clocks are quite rare for games.</li><li>FCEUX uses a setup for sprites 8x16 by clocking the IRQ only when background or sprites are enabled, and PPU $2000 AND $38 = $18 (sprites or BG enabled, 8x8 sprite mode).</li></ul>Could someone help me with this thing, please?

<br />Perhaps what you misunderstand is the pattern of rises. I'll try to explain it; if that doesn't help, I'll have to draw some waveforms in GIMP. Should I?
<br />
<br />If $1000 sprites and $0000 BG, which is the canonical setup, then the first detected rise will be at x=260. There are eight rises, at 260, 268, ..., 316, but only the first ordinarily triggers a tick because they're 8 dots apart, which is less than 16. 
<br />
<br />If $0000 sprites and $1000 BG, then the first detected rise will be at x=324. There are 34 rises, at 324, 332, 4, 12, ..., 252, but only the first ordinarily triggers a tick because they're 8 or 13 dots apart, which is less than 16. (The 13 occurs at the end of a line between the second and third pairs of pattern fetches, when the PPU rests from 336 to 340.)
<br />
<br />In either case, mixing 8x16 sprites from $0000 and $1000 will often cause multiple detected rises in one vblank because the pattern fetches from $1000 are, for example, 16 or 24 dots apart with intervening pattern fetches from $0000.

<br />
<br />Thanks, but it's not necessary for me, at least.
<br />
<br />Well, there's one thing you didn't get either: I consider two addresses. One is what you use for $2006/$2007 _and_ setting up the scrolling for drawing. Another is what's being fetched from the pattern/name tables, and this one is being "A12". Yes, I check A12 when $2006/2007 is accessed.
<br />
<br />Next, I don't understand dot 324, regarding the <em>previous</em> scanline. How's that possible? I mean, when ppu cycle is 324, what should be done?

<br />I don't know how much it helps you Zepper, but this is basically what I did with my hardware MMC3 and I passed all of Blarg's tests.  Maybe a hardware explanation will help.
<br />
<br />I agree with Kevtris' hypothesis that the actual MMC3 is 'time filtering' by watching M2 clocks.  When I get around to it I'll actually verify this with my logic analyzer.
<br />
<br />For now I have a counter that gets reset to zero whenever CHR A12 goes high.  Then at the end of each CPU clock cycle (M2 falling edge) I clock the counter if CHR A12 is low.  If the cpu cycle counter gets above ~5 then allow the next rising edge of CHR A12 to clock the MMC3 scanline counter.  This is only slightly different than what Tepples laid out.  His method would ALWAYS increment the counter reguardless of CHR A12, where I assume CHR A12 is an asyncronous reset signal that would prevent incrementing the counter whenever CHR A12 is high.
<br />
<br />5 CPU cycles is about 14-16 PPU cycles (dots) so you could alternatively count those and it should work.  That's something that the actual MMC3 can't do though...

In the standard configuration PPU A12 clicks 8 times during the flyback line. In this case, if the processor does access to the PPU, additional clicks of A12 may occur. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XkFRfS4sC8" class="postlink">Watch this video</a>, IRQ (blue) assert at every 8 toggles PPU A12 (yellow). It clearly seen how the IRQ is shifted with respect to horizontal flyback. So, you need a digital filter that is often PPU A12 toggling were as one.<br />In our <a href="http://nesdev.com/bbs/viewtopic.php?t=8781" class="postlink">cartridge</a> we made easier (I think it close to original):<br /><img src="http://savepic.net/2604998.png" alt="Image" /><br />As a result, the counter strobe STB (on the schematic he inverted) is activated with the first toggle PPU A12 and returned only after 4 toggles of F2 signal of 6502. This is more than enough, though, of course, possible to increase this value up to 100 (remember that in the line of about 113 cycles of F2, was tested with the oscilloscope).<br /><img src="http://savepic.net/2591686.png" alt="Image" /><br /><br />I'm slowpoke. :3<br /><div class="quotetitle">infiniteneslives wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"><div class="quotetitle">tepples wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">There are two rules:<br /><ul><li>A12 rise within less than 16 dots of last A12 rise: no tick. </li><li>Any other A12 rise: tick.</li></ul></div><br /><br />I don't know how much it helps you Zepper, but this is basically what I did with my hardware MMC3 and I passed all of Blarg's tests.

<br />
<br />Based on the last post, I do not think this is entirely correct, it's more like this: A12 has been low for more that 16 dots and now rises: tick; otherwise: no tick.
<br />
<br />The way this seems to be done is by delaying the lowering of the strobe signal when A12 is low, as can be seen by the above pics.
<br />
<br />Zepper, are you doing a pixel-by-pixel emulation or are you using timestamps? Timestamps are a devil with MMC3 IRQs!

<br />
<br />blargg's test writes $00 to $2000 and toggles $2006, expecting the IRQ to be clocked... and it fails here in my emulator.
