		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I have a request. I would like an NSF rip of Zelda II: The Adventure of Link with full soundtrack, including the musical bits for both the Fairy and Whistle (neither of which are on even ugetab's webpage).
<br />
<br />Oh, and I downloaded the full, 23-track NSF file for Zelda II from ugetab's website yesterday. It worked fine yesterday, but today it gives me an error message everytime I try to play it (both on Meridian Advance and Winamp)--even though every other NFS and SPC file works fine (including a Super Mario 3 NSF also from ugetab's page). So it seems to be a corrupted file, for whatever reason. I already emailed ugetab about it personally and am waiting to hear back from him/her. Does anyone else have any idea what to do about this error?? (I'm stuck with the inferior, 16-track Zophar version in the meantime--which sucks since Zelda II is perhaps my favorite NES game musically.)
<br />
<br />Many thanks!!

If it begins to follow a work/corrupt pattern, then you should probably run a surface scan on the drive using chkdsk. I'm listening to the file I have locally without issue, and if it worked before, you should revert to the working version. Also, restart your computer after this if it still doesn't work.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Actually, I figured out what the problem was--the Meridian Advance player I was using worked just fine on the Zophar files because they're older, just as the Meridian is older. Using Meridian on a newer file, like yours ugetab, caused a compatibility problem. Anyway, at someone's suggestion, I downloaded a newer Winamp NSF plugin, and now your NSF set works just fine. So, thanks!
<br />
<br />Still, any chance of a Zelda II rip with the whistle and fairy mini-music in it? No hurry, though. If you're too busy, that's cool.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Hello! Newb here.
<br />Sorry if I missed any of these but this is a monster of a thread.
<br />Are there nsfs for-
<br />--Super Sprint
<br />--Track and Field (I)
<br />--American Gladiators (sfx are a must for this game <img src="./images/smilies/icon_cool.gif" alt="8)" title="Cool" />, hilarious scream sample)
<br />--Akumajou Dracula (FDS)?
<br />
<br />Other nsfs of interest-
<br />--Super Pang 2 (the one I have is incomplete with just 1 track)
<br />--Swords and Serpents (track 2 loops back to track 1, track 3 does the same but is incomplete by a couple measures and freezes)
<br />--Bucky O'Hare (some tracks may be weird with looping. bass is messed up in track 7, and parts get off when it loops)
<br />
<br />Also, a friend of mine is putting together a a simple but well organized archive of nsfs together. I believe it has everything from zophar as well as that from as many personal collections as he could find. It should be up by tonight... with the best part about it being that all files renamed in full. So you don't have to deal with renaming every other file you unzip from zophar or from elsewhere. Unless if you like a lot of abbreviated filenames. :p
<br />For the sake of consistancy I helped with renaming all soundtracks with sound expansions to have their respective tags in parenthesis at the end (FDS, N106, etc...). I'm only doing this to games that actually make use of their sound expansions, if they have it and don't use I didn't bother.
<br />
<br />This is the list of all FDS games we had within our collection that used the extra channel:
<br />Ai Senshi Nicol
<br />Arumana no Kiseki
<br />Backgammon
<br />Big Challenge! Dogfight Spirit
<br />Big Challenge! Go! Go! Bowling
<br />Bio Miracle Bokutte Upa
<br />Cleopatra no Mahou
<br />Dirty Pair - Project Eden
<br />Dracula II (Castlevania 2)
<br />Exciting Baseball
<br />Exciting Basketball
<br />Exciting Billiard
<br />Exciting Soccer
<br />Falsion
<br />Famicom Grand Prix 2 - 3D Hot Rally
<br />Famicom Tantei Club Part II
<br />Fire Bam
<br />Ginga Densgou - Galaxy Odyssey
<br />Golf Japan Course
<br />Golf U.S. Course
<br />Hao Kun no Fushigina Tabi
<br />KiKi KaiKai
<br />Knight Move
<br />Link no Bouken (Zelda 2)
<br />Meikyuu Jiin Dababa
<br />Metroid
<br />Nakayama Miho no Tokimeki High School
<br />Nazo No Murasamejou
<br />Risa no Yousei Densetsu
<br />Santa no Takarabaki
<br />Shin Onigashima
<br />Suishou No Ryuu
<br />Super Mario Bros Vs
<br />Time Twist
<br />Tobidase Daisukusen (3D World Runner)
<br />Vs. Excitebike
<br />Yume KooJoo Doki Doki Panic (Super Mario Bros 2)
<br />Yuushi no Monshou
<br />Yuuyuuki
<br />Zelda no Densetsu (Zelda)
<br />
<br />I'm not entirely sure how accurate this list of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Famicom_Disk_System_games" class="postlink">FDS</a> games on wikipedia is, but it would seem that a lot of FDS games don't have nsfs yet, or we haven't found them. Anything we don't yet have we'll want to get for sure, but my first interest is finding all the FDS games first that stand out from standard soundtracks, however minimal the use may be or not. If you got any we missed or know where to find them, many thanks!

<br />
<br />1) I think the NSF rip for Zelda no Densetsu (FDS) should have the SFX included.
<br />2) Popeye should be reripped. Some notes are missing in some tracks.
<br />3) One of the tracks from Kirby's Adventure should be fixed. It's the Kirby's Dreamland title theme.
<br />
<br />That's all I can add. Long live the FDS. ^_^
