		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />so i just bought a willem pcb4 eprom programmer, now i need some eproms.  i was wondering if i can use 27c256 in place of 128k eproms on the donor board.  i was looking at these:
<br />
<br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://cgi.ebay.com/28-EPROMS-27c256-20-EPROM_W0QQitemZ7548650412QQcategoryZ4663QQrdZ1QQcmdZViewItem">http://cgi.ebay.com/28-EPROMS-27c256-20 ... dZViewItem</a><!-- m -->
<br />
<br />is that too much to pay?  i have no clue how much they go for, does anyone know a good place to get them besides ebay?  thanks

They were a little more expensive than the ones you linked, but they were also twice as fast, new, and came from a respected distributor.
<br />
<br />A 27C256 is only 32 kB big. I think you probably want a 27C010. You can replace a 128 kB NES ROM with a 27C010 EPROM by following the instructions in <a href="http://nesdev.com/NES%20EPROM%20Conversions.txt" class="postlink">NES EPROM Conversions.txt</a>. (For example, CHR ROM on an SLROM board is 128 kB.)

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />ok, so i understand the first part about the letters and the mappers, but the variants are confusing me.  i dont know what SRAM is.  So say that Batman returns is 128k PRG, 256 CHR and the mapper is MMC3 (4), what board is this?  I assume it would start with S so it would be a SNROM, SLROM or SVROM.

<br />SRAM is additionnal RAM on the cartridge, usually battery-backed to handle save games in RPGs, but there also is games that have SRAM and no battery backup, so this just expands usual RAM, for example Kid Icarus, Metroid, Air Fortress, Chessmaster, Batman-Return of the Jocker, etc... are games with SRAM and with no Save games. To check if the game has SRAM, checking the battery bit in iNES header isn't a good idea because all games I mentionned above would have this bit clear (no battery), but they still uses SRAM. So, the best way is to use the FCEUltra's debbuger and put breakpoint for all read and writes to $6000-$7fff. If there is any, the game has probably SRAM. Or use VirtuaNES' memory viewer, go at loctaion $6000-$7fff and see if its data seems used or not.
<br />Batman Begins has CHR ROM and no SRAM, so it's second letter is probably L. So you're checking for a TLROM board. It is one of the most common board, and there is a lot of common bad games using it, so buy one, and modify the board in funtion of what drk414 says.

If the game never writes or reads $6000-$7ffff, there is surely no SRAM. I just know that Goonies uses an obscure mapper where $6000 is a mapper register, but this is a very particular case.

<br />
<br />Nope.   But just because they are 28 pin doesnt mean the board cant accept 32.   Look to the end of the 28 pin chip, and are there 2 holes (that would continue the row of pin's) that are soldered up?
