<br />
<br />A friend at school told me he wants to compose the music for my homebrew game, and I just want to get this ready for him to use.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I've come up with a few general pointers for some successful conversions to SPC:
<br />
<br />1. Do not go over 64 patterns, 'lest your SPC crash.
<br />2. Try not to go over 40,000 for a sample length total. Go over and you're OK... just be cautious, as you won't be able to use all 64 patterns without going over the memory limit. This is assuming all of the 64 patterns are 64 rows or less... you can have a few 128 row patterns. Do NOT go over 80,000 for a sample length total, or else you're going to most likely use up too much memory.
<br />3. I'd suggest trying for 128 loop length. Otherwise, slight possibility your sample might glitch out on the loop points.
<br />4. Lower your global volume to prevent volume overload... if you're not using Or to emulate what it would sound like in the SPC file, max out the mix volume, then adjust your global volume.
<br />
<br />There are a few bugs that I know of (mukunda fixed these when I went to him for conversion since I don't use a Windows computer... though the zip files were not updated as far as my knowledge goes):
<br />
<br />1. Qxx can crash your SPC. The bug is in Skipp and Friends that affects SNES9X 1.52 and bsnes at the very least... not to mention a real SNES. Actually, mukunda fixed this after the release of the game.
<br />2. Echo commands are mis-defined... E03 and E04 are reversed.
<br />
<br />I've successfully fitted an 11 minute tune into a SPC once... only barely. I've got some music made for SNES that is untested since the application is Windows only.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />So is SNESMOD fairly easy to implement into a project and use for both music and sound effects in games? I've seen the demo game with it but I'm not sure how well that represents your typical SNES game. Music is great and all but if you can't have enough sound effects and music then that's no good.

<br />
<br />Note that this build is for PowerPC Macs, and I strongly reccomend at least Mac OS X 10.4.11. If there's a problem, just let me know what hardware you're running...
