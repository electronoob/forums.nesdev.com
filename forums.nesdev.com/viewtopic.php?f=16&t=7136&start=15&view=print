<br />
<br />There are ways of putting boxes side-by-side but letting boxes drop to another row on a narrow display. Most of these involve <strong>display:inline-block</strong>. I could create a template to <a href="http://foohack.com/2007/11/cross-browser-support-for-inline-block-styling/" class="postlink">apply a variant of inline-block that also works in outdated IE</a>, but because of how MediaWiki handles the | character (which has to be escaped as &amp;#124;), ASCII art diagrams don't work so well inside templates. But fortunately, just using &lt;pre style="display:inline-block"&gt; appears to work.

<br />Even with a narrow browser window? Does it move the third pinout below the first two?
<br />
<br />Is there something magic about three pinouts across? In other words, will there be cases in the future where you want four across? It seems that two across is a good limit that fits comfortably in narrower browser windows.

<br />
<br />For me multiple pinouts in a row is a dream coming true. It makes it SO much easier to compare them, and see what is different. Now anyone can easily compare EPROM pinouts and Nintendo's mask ROMs pinouts in an eye of blink. Before you'd have to scroll up and down, and this was terrible.
<br />
<br />Of course if you have to scroll left and right I understand this is a problem as well but then I guess your monitor is REALLY small. On my 14' notebook, there is a lot of margin with 3 pinouts side-by-side. In fact I hesitated to place the MMC5 pinouts aside with them (5 pinouts) but decided this was too large, and that MMC5 boards were rare enough to fit a separate section.
<br />
<br />But since apparently tepples fixed the problem (thank you), I guess it's all right now.
<br />
<br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">The goal of the wiki is to share information, not to remove it, right?</div>
<br />Of course it is ! The goals of the changes I and tepples were making are to spread the same information on less pages than it originally was, so that it's easier to browse. Of course if anything goes wrong (like the non-clarity of what was a JEDEC pinout), please just say it so we can improve/fix the thing. (or if you have an idea to make the wiki better, just go ahead and modify it).
<br />
<br />By the way, anyone who have boards such as SL1ROM, TL1ROM, RROM, etc... with an different pinout should check it out and put it on the wiki. I don't have any of these unfortunately.

<br />If this was the main goal, what about presenting the information in a different format? You could have three (or more) columns of pin names on either side of the chip, allowing easier comparison than the current setup. I've added an <a href="http://wiki.nesdev.com/w/index.php/Mask_ROM_pinout#8kB_.2F_16kB_.2F_32kB_.2F_64kBytes_.2828pin.29_ROMs" class="postlink">example of this</a>. I tried making it as a table, but that didn't handle well, so I just made it into an ASCII picture like the others.

This argument makes no sense. You can enlarge the window to look at the pinout whenever you want. Nobody forces you to use only a small part of your screen. This argument makes absolutely zero sense.

<br />Well I hesitate. How you made it is pretty interesting, it allows to have multiple pinouts on a single diagram (instead of multiple diagrams) which is even better in therms of compacting things. However, with already the signals in backets for unused adress pins, it becomes maybe a bit too much ?
<br />In this example the pinout is the same for the 3 cases (EPROM, PRG-ROM and CHR-ROM), but this is not the case for larger sizes. Therefore, a similar diagram, where differences only are shown is interesting, as opposed to make them in bolt.
<br />
<br />Pesonally I'd leave thing either as my/tepples diagrams-in-a-table or Blargg's compact diagrams, but definitely not both on the same page, as it looks retarded to have redundant info.
<br />
<br />Any other opinions on which one is better ?

<br />
<br />People who use a 1920x1080 monitor with the "snap" feature of Windows 7 or the "tile vertically" feature of previous Windows versions have a 960px window, which is just a tad narrower than the 1024px of a netbook or a 17" desktop monitor.
<br />
<br />And I've discovered that operating system matters. My Ubuntu netbook uses a substitution for Courier New that's slightly smaller than the authentic Courier New that I see on my Windows machine. Three diagrams in the 128-512 section line up across in Ubuntu but not in Windows.

This argument makes no sense.</div><br />Just because the way I use a computer, with multiple windows open at once, is foreign to you doesn't mean I simply object to things for the hell of it, FFS. I don't know if you've ever used a desk before, but usually you have multiple things sitting on its surface, and you refer to one or more while you're working on another. It's the same with a computer. They have windows on screen and they can overlap, be resized, and be rearranged so that there are multiple visible at once. Sorry to be explaining this, but I get the idea you use your computer with only one window filling the entire screen at once. When I used to have a small monitor, I'd have to do that since there wasn't much room for more than one window, but it was pure tedium, constantly switching between windows. With a larger display, I can put things side-by-side and not constantly switch windows. Web pages which demand a really wide browser window suck, and I don't want the wiki to suck like that. Almost always, information can be presented in a way that doesn't require a really wide page. By doing that, more styles of browsing can be accommodated.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">I really feel like you are trying to annoy me for a vengeance or something,</div><br />Likewise. The way you respond makes it seem like you dismiss anyone else's problems if they aren't a problem for you. That is not the way to design a website that's meant for others than yourself.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">Pesonally I'd leave thing either as my/tepples diagrams-in-a-table or Blargg's compact diagrams, but definitely not both on the same page, as it looks retarded to have redundant info.</div>
<br />Indeed, I merely added the compact one so we could decide the best approach. I do NOT think the individual pinouts should be removed from the Wiki entirely. If one wants the pinout of a PRG ROM, one does not want any other information cluttering it. That may go on a different page that's not specifically comparing pinouts, but it should go somewhere.

<br />
<br />The whole point of this thread was to remove duplications of information on the wiki and make info more compact on less pages.
<br />Your way of displaying diagrams is more compact, I'll give you that, so I'd agree to use it on the page. But then the old way should be deleted - it would be crazy to have diagrams in multiple format because people can't agree which one is the "right" one.
<br />
<br />BTW even your diagrams takes some width, about 2/3 as much as mines.
