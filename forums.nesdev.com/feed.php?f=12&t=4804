Porting a NES game to SNES is not hard if you have the source code. Most of the code can stay the same, the differences will be three things. Audio, Graphics, and Memory Mapping. Simple NES games that are NROM have been hacked by various groups to run on SNES without any access to source.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=1726">MottZilla</a> — Thu Feb 05, 2009 5:54 pm</p><hr />
