The actual game is programmed in a modern engine, but using tiles and so on.<br /><br />I was wondering that if you split the screen, or use some other technique like raster split, you would gain another set of colours for those tiles?<br /><br />Something like below, where the screen is somehow split at the water line and uses the second palette there.<br /><br /><img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/1336763/pirate-ship-progress01.png" alt="Image" />

However, be aware: doing this on a NES tends to be somewhat tricky/temperamental, as it's very timing-sensitive and depending on what mapper you use may cause things like a scanline of corruption and/or flicker (really depends on timing). There are commercial games which do this (I think Wizards &amp; Warriors is one of them<sup>[1]</sup>).<br /><br />I often tell people developing games on non-NES consoles this: if you want to make a game that's &quot;like&quot; the NES in graphical style, go right ahead.  But unless you absolutely no-questions-asked plan on making the game for the actual NES itself, there's really no reason to limit yourself to how the system behaves or how some of the mappers are implemented (ex. MMC5's graphical extensions, scanline/IRQ counter, etc.); just make the game you want and make it look like whatever style you want.<br /><br />A great present-day example of this is Shovel Knight, where the graphics are &quot;NES-like&quot; but wouldn't work flawlessly if the game were actually designed on the NES (it would work fine on the SNES).  On the other hand, the music done by Jake Kaufman/Virt and Manami MATSUME was actually composed in FamiTracker (I believe) and thus is 100% natively available on a NES (more specifically: on an actual Famicom -- the music uses Konami's VRC6 mapper, whose audio capabilities would not work on a non-modded NES).  The MP3/in-game versions sound more &quot;full&quot; or &quot;fat&quot; because of post-mixing (ask Jake, he can tell you :-) ).

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />The NES isn't very friendly with mid-screen palette changes. Fact is you can turn rendering off mid-screen, upload a new set of palettes, reset the scroll to the proper location, and enable rendering back on (rendering would have to be disabled for more than 1 scanline depending on how many colors you need to change). There are a few problems with this approach though:<br /><br />Both the background and the sprites have to be disabled so you can write to the palette, otherwise the PPU isn't actually resting and your VRAM accesses will clash with the PPU's and you'll get all sorts of corrupted graphics. The second issue is that while rendering is off and the PPU address is pointing to the palette area, the color being pointed gets rendered, which means that you'll get a rainbow-like effect in the scanlines where the updates are taking place. This effect can be made less noticeable by turning grayscale mode on, so you'll see a few grays instead of rainbows, but it's still weird. The final issue I can think of, is that disabling sprites mid-frame is a risky task. If it's not done at a precise time or when the sprites are arranged in a certain way, you might get corrupted sprites the next frame or when they are re-enabled.<br /><br />In conclusion, the short answer is no, you can't get a clean split like in your mock-ups.<br /><br />If the water is not moving up and down, the safest thing to do is to simply sacrifice 1 of the palettes for all the underwater stuff. If the water does move up and down, one thing to consider are the color emphasis bits: the PPU has 3 bits you can change at any time that will emphasize the red, green or blue (or combinations of those colors) in the entire palette. You could emphasize the blue for the underwater sections, but the effect is much more subtle than in your mock-ups. To make this effect more harsh, you can simultaneously turn on the grayscale mode and the blue emphasis, which is what the game <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Wwm4hfl80U" class="postlink">Noah's Ark</a> does. The good think about these settings is that they can be changed freely at any time without messing the the rendering process. Keep in mind that they affect all colors, even sprites.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />There are all sorts of permutations of weird technical possibilities that you could pull off on the NES, but a lot of them really aren't typical. Like, if you're trying to faithfully &quot;fake&quot; the look of an NES game, you probably don't want to be trying special tricks that aren't really part of the NES experience.<br /><br />For instance, MMC5 8x8 pixel attributes were only used in 1 game, to my knowledge (Just Breed), and it was a Japan-only RPG. It's a thing you could technically pull off on an NES, but it's not characteristic of NES games at all. Part of the reason it wasn't used is that having 8x8 pixel granularity in the world can quadruple the complexity of your map (ROM size constraints, RAM constraints, extra collision tests required, etc.) so even if you had the special MMC5 hardware for 8x8 attributes, it's a significant burden on the NES to make a world that puts it to use!<br /><br />A palette change for a status bar is an advanced and atypical technique. A clean palette change during normal background rendering is elite tier. Something like this usually comes with weird design constraints, and these are things you don't really consider when you're just looking at one technical issue; you only find them when you try to build a whole game. Suddenly you find this one technical feature you implemented is dictating how you have to design your maps, etc. A lot of these techniques aren't seen much for good reason (though sometimes it's just that we have better knowledge and tools now than back then).<br /><br />An emphasis change like Noah's ark is fairly easy to implement. It's not typical, but it's very doable. Your water line has to be straight, this way, though.<br /><br />Anyhow, I don't really understand the point of trying to push the NES graphical capabilites to the limit without actually using an NES. It doesn't matter what was technically possible or not. Just make a nice game, and if you like the NES look, imitate the parts of it that feel good to you, and ignore the rest. If it's important to you that it be NES-faithful, for some reason, you should probably stick to normal techniques that look and feel like real NES games, not technical obscurities... but... never mind my opinion. I don't know what motivates you. If you can make a good game out of it, do whatever suits you.

Because that looks a tad more washed out than I expected.
