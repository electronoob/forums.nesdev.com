<br />No, an NES emulator does not need a JIT - this was for educational purposes only, and I was hoping to share the information I learned with anyone who was thinking about doing the same thing, either for the NES or other emulators. No doubt though, it was fun, and the performance increase in NES CPU emulation is astounding.
<br />
<br />Opinions, comments and/or questions are more than welcome. Sorry its in DOC format - my converter thingie didn't work right.

<br />Unless you're on a platform with a 16.8 MHz CPU and a video chip whose rendering model resembles that of the NES. In that case, you'll need to implement a 6502 to ARM JIT, even if only as practice before implementing 65c816, SPC700, MC68000, and Z80 JITs.

<br />I wrote a very simple and object-oriented interpreter to use for writing the translator: I was wary in posting benchmarks since the purpose of the paper is not to say "hey look DBT is so much faster LOL", but to outline the DBTs implementation. The benchmarks were mainly to show how a translator compares in its optimizations. I guess you could say the above picture compares a naive interpreter solution to an optimized dynamic translator for gags.
<br />
<br />Increasing the speed of my interpreter should also speed up the DBT as well, since it often makes use of the interpreter.

It was neat how the algorithm came together, with the block convertor meshing smoothly with translated blocks and the interpreter. The most interesting part for me is optimization of flags. On older architectures with implicit flag setting, that's one of the biggest opportunities for elimination of unneeded operations.
<br />
<br />One area of optimization I didn't see mentioned is translation-time differentiation of absolute memory accesses based on what address range they access, i.e. $0-$2000 (low memory), $2000-$4017 (PPU/APU registers), etc. For the registers, you could even dispatch specific ones separately, since $2002 for example is read heavily by some games. So an lda $2000 would turn into a direct call to read_ppu_2002(). How extensive is clock counting? I'm wondering how much that bogs it down.

The impression I get is that if the JIT did nothing other than inline each instruction, performance would only go up by about 5 instructions per 6502 instruction.  But if it did lots of optimization and replaced a layered and emulated memory model with a native memory model, performance could increase dramatically.  Mainly from removing layers from the memory system, but changing the 6502 sequences to optimized ARM sequences wouldn't hurt either.

In my JIT I do in fact differentiate absolute memory accesses and use specific translations in this case (I don't call a method). Calling a method would still be better than abandoning the translation and letting the interpreter handle it however.<br /><br />One of the difficult things I'm struggling with is how to translate a block with this:<br /><br />LDA 0x7<br />STA $05<br />LDA 0x20<br />STA $06<br />LDA 0x2<br />STA ($05)<br /><br />See how we write to address 0x2007 indirectly? However address $05 doesn't contain 0x2007 until the block executes - so I have NO WAY of determing this is going to write to 0x2007 at translation time (without complicating things like a mother). Therefore when it comes time to translate the STA ($05) I incorrectly have it modify memory - when I should have it translate to an address-specific translation or method call like you said. I'm still working on this problem - possibly have the interpreter run blocks at least once before translation to determine if this occurred.<br /><br /><br />Clock counting really doesn't bog things down much. In the actual translated code, its only one extra instruction per branch, and two or three extra instructions per block. In the actual translation, we have to add cycles as we're translating, but remember the speed of the translator <em>is not critcal</em>(take with grain of salt). In 10,000 vblanks, we have a whopping 350 translations in Mario Bros. That's not much, and so the extra code to count cycles as one is going along in the translation becomes moot.<br /><br />Thanks for the questions Blargg.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">Dwedit wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">I'm most familiar with the GBA based nes emulator PocketNES, with an optimized ARM-ASM 6502 interpreter.

<br />
<br />I think after block-linking (one of the optimizations) any JIT will be significantly faster than any interpreter, and becomes worth doing. Note how the performance increased five times when this was done.
<br />
<br />However you're right - if you really want speed extra optimizations are the way to go. How you handle memory is a pretty implementation specific issue, but you're right in the fact no translation should go through any type of memory layer: a translation must access memory directly for it to be fast. My translator does this by having the mapper be responsible for returning pointers to memory locations that will later be accessed directly. That way I can still keep the memory access one-level deep and be flexible (i.e. crazy mapper stuff) at the same time.
<br />
<br />I couldn't imagine how much slower the translator would be if the translations went through levels of memory access. yikes!
<br />
<br />Thanks for the input.

<br />
<br />Forgive me if I misunderstand what you mean by the first question: I'm a little rusty on my NES architecture details. If things like video and sound require knowledge of the cycle certain accesses occurred, then they must be logged somehow, which no doubt will add more overhead I didn't account for. If I was going to turn this in to a full emulator, writes and reads to special I/O registers would likely log to a linked list chain of "access blocks" or the like, and be processed later. Waitstates are currently not handled at all.
<br />
<br />The great thing about a translator is that at any time you can go "you know what, this particular thing is to hard to handle" and claim the block is un-translatable: leaving your interpreter (which I guess yours is pretty fast) to handle it. 
<br />
<br />The questions you posed could probably be answered if I attempted to implement them. I'd love to hear any ideas on how to do so in the context of the translator: no doubt it IS possible and would probably be faster than a corresponding interpreter solution.

<br />Yeah, I think loops is where we would see the biggest performance gain, but that's lost when ending blocks on branches.

<br />On a related note, someone made a PSX emulator in Java, and it uses a JIT:

<br />What's cool about making a JIT in Java is that you don't need to worry about optimizing the translated code (dead code removal, register allocation). If you just translate into Java bytecode, Hotspot will then take care of the final optimization for the target platform - and Hotspot is very good at that. And furthermore, you get three platforms in one - Windows, Linux, Mac. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />

Simplicity breeds correctness.</div><br /><br />If correctness was the priority, one wouldn't be doing a translator in the first place! Hehe. However I agree with you - getting it working should be a priority, but at the end of the paper he claims it wasn't really worth the work: if he had worked a bit harder in the speed area he may have seen the fruits of his labor. <br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">Tepples wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">And what happens if the same instruction writes to RAM or to I/O depending on what comes before the block? <a href="http://www.tripoint.org/kevtris/mappers/incoming/ewj2prot.txt" class="postlink">It's been done</a>.<br /></div><br /><div class="quotetitle">Nessie wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">But it's impossible to determine whether the indirect access will ever affect an I/O register or not. If it's difficult to insert a call to a WriteHandler, perhaps it's simpler to just abandon translation of all blocks with indirect access. As blargg pointed out, they're not very common anyway. <br /></div><br /><br />You guys bring up a good issue. Normally this would work if the interpreter could assume an indirect instruction would always write to a I/O register OR always write to RAM. I can see three possibilities:<br /><br />1) Execute a block multiple times in the interpreter looking for this special case (maybe in 10 times, a morphing indirect instruction will show its ugly head). - will possibly fail if we're unlucky<br />2) Keep a list of games which do this - abandon translations which use indirect addressing in these games, or use method call approach<br />3) Always use method call approach<br /><br />Abanonding blocks can be fatal - I've seen the same blocks can be executed hundreds of thousands of times - if the indirect access is in a tight loop its a big loss. If I was gong to do this I'd probably go in the above in order, seeing which one worked out.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">Nessie wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">Yeah, I think loops is where we would see the biggest performance gain, but that's lost when ending blocks on branches. <br /></div>
<br />
<br />The size of the block has no affect on the speed of looping, but you bring up a good point in that the small block problem won't be as visible one is tightly looping. That said, if he isn't using the block linking optimization, <em>tight loops are almost as slow as using an interpreter anyway</em>. Notice how he said what made his emulator playable in many cases was when he detected tight loops and "skipped" them by just executing the interrupt the loop was trying to detect. I can see why he would need to do this.
<br />
<br />Thanks for your comments/input guys. Let me know if I can better clear anything up.
