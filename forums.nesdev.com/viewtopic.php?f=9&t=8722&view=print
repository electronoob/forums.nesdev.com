<br />Thank you kyuusaku, this was enough info to figure out that Mouser and Digikey don't have anything exactly like this in stock, but since they are my main sources, would anything else take its place? Maybe something cheaper.

<br />I bought all they had left at the time, 31, I hope they get more in, but I can confirm they do work in the top loader just fine.
<br />Still would like to know if there are other chips that can be used in place of the originals and where to get them.

<br />But, like I said earlier, I have little knowledge of these chips and what would work in their place etc.
<br />No I hope not every broken top loader I have needs these or I won't have enough and none for future repairs.

<br />
<br />It's just SRAM nothing special.  If you took the time to read the data sheet and or snoop around on the net you could learn how it works.  Once you did that you could configure nearly any SRAM that was 2KB or greater to work.  The only thing you might have difficulty with is the package and pinout.  But here again the datasheet saves the day.

<br />I'm not a total newb, I did snoop around and it is the package and pinout that is the problem, at least for the top loader.
<br />The chips are tucked in between the cart connector and other chips so using .6" dip chips is not an option.

<br />Very cool 80sFREAK! 
<br />How did you come up with the numbers? 
<br />I checked findchips.com and most are not available, some MBs are around, but higher prices than the ones kyuusaku found on jameco.

Fortunately with RAM all the address lines are completely interchangeable, so rewiring to fit an oversize one is a fairly straightforward task.

They arw 16,192 bit SRAM.  So you should expect them to be reasonably more expensive than a NAND gate.  Just to put it in perspective for you the SRAM you're looking for has somewhere around 70,000+ transistors inside.  A '00 NAND gate should have less than 100 transistors inside.  Not that transistor count directly relates to price, but it has a factor in difficulty to manufacture and test which does have an effect on price.<br /><br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">lidnariq wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">Fortunately with RAM all the address lines are completely interchangeable</div>
<br />
<br />Data lines are interchangeable as well.
<br />
<br />This whole post still boggles me.  I can't figure out why someone would need these so badly?  Are you just stocking up on them to be able to repair top loaders for eternity?  Because if you are I would think that having 30+ of them in your stock would be enough to repair 1000's of toploaders because the chances of this part failing are low.  Even still if you NEEDED 100s of them just spend some time learning and you'll be able to replace it with any 0.3" SRAM &gt;=2KB.   I'm just saying all this because you keep claiming to be a newb.  I'm just letting you know that once you understand these parts you will NEVER have a hard time coming up with a replacement regardless of how many you need.
