		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />When Phil Katz designed the Zip file format for PKZIP, he published the Zip specification as &quot;APPNOTE&quot;. This led to interoperable implementations by third parties, such as Info-ZIP, WinZip, and 7-Zip. But because the RAR file format is deliberately not publicly specified, there is only one implementation. With this sort of monoculture, implementation errors like <a href="https://bugs.chromium.org/p/project-zero/issues/detail?id=1286&amp;can=1&amp;q=unrar&amp;desc=6" class="postlink">this one</a> are more likely to lead to widespread exploits.<br /><br />So why do people even use RAR anymore instead of something more modern, like 7-Zip? RAR's technical advantage over Zip is solid archiving, and its advantage over Zip and Tar is a larger window size to make solid archiving actually meaningful. But 7-Zip has both of these features plus public source code under a free software license.<br /><br />Is it just inertia in the warez and SPC scenes?

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I think the answer is simply this: habit. But since zip is built into windows (since when? Vista?), i would've thunk noone is really using it anymore since zip is more accessible, right out of the box. Most .rars i encounter are on really old sites. <br /><br />And using tar is about as simple from console, and linux users are generally more active in their software choices.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I still use WinRAR as my usual de/compressor program (I registered it many years ago, and it works nicely enough), but will use ZIP format by default for compression since it seems to have the widest support. (...and .tar.gz if it's a linux thing, I guess.) I'd just use 7-Zip in cases I didn't already have WinRAR installed.<br /><br />The place I would see RAR most often was for large archives that needed to be split into multiple files. With RAR that was a built-in part of the format, at least. Though, it was common for people to split ZIP files with a separate program (e.g. HJSplit) for a while-- but I think that era is more than 10 years gone.<br /><br />I couldn't say why anyone would end up choosing RAR by default (I certainly would not), but I will say that <em>most</em> people don't notice/understand/care that it's a &quot;proprietary&quot; format, especially since there's like a zillion free utilities that can unpack it. So... the main reason you think it's obsolete is actually irrelevant to most.<br /><br />TBH I almost never see .RAR files, though. Where are you even noticing this, tepples?<br /><br /><br />(Also funny to me: a set of NES ROMs torrent I recently found had individual ROMs compressed as 7z, completely trashing any solid archive advantage it maybe could have used with all these variant dumps.)

Size difference between the two is very small and RAR generally provides better performance on my hardware. I still have 7zip installed for the few archives that RAR cannot handle for whatever reason.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />7-Zip is still seem to be compression better than RAR anyways (I have once decompressed a RAR (actually a .cbr) and recompressed it as 7-Zip (.cb7) and it resulted a smaller file; but this is just one test so not very meaningful).<br /><br />I have never used the 7-Zip GUI but only the command-line tools, and it seem to work OK. (You can open some other formats too, including ISO, ARJ, CAB, Apple disk images, DocFile, etc. (but not Hamster archive). I have sometimes found files in less common formats and I was able to open them with 7-Zip, so it is useful.)<br /><br />7-Zip supports solid compression and will even group files by extension by default in order to improve compression. However, even with stuff such as .tar.xz you can support solid compression, although you should then to put file in the order you need by yourself.<br /><br />I don't know what RAR versions are in use, although it may be of the point to add a message for attackment in this forum to specify that you shouldn't upload RAR files that don't have a Free implementation (not as a strict rule, but just as a recommendation).

Which if you want to just store stuff is fine, but when you need to extract something to execute it, then they become a pain. As you have the Zip folder and a Folder version. With RAR windows sees it as a file. <br />Also WinRAR has a solid UI, that we all know how to use, it has solid explorer integration and features. <br />A lot of people in the Retro Scene tend to cling to the past, and love Windows XP and still only use XP  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt=":roll:" title="Rolling Eyes" /> so they also tend to use RAR for the explorer menu and support of XP still. <br /><br />7zip might be just as good, might even be better, but WinRAR is Good Enough, and there is not really much from a user experience point of view to warrant the energy required to migrate, unless you are targeting an Amiga platform to which LHA is the go to.
