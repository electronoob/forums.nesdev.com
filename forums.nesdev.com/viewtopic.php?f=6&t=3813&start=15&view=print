Sumiyama, N. Nakazato, H. Suganami, A. Fujio, K. Kimura, Y. Yamada, M. Ootani, K. Shimoide<br /><br />ZD used a .frm information submission system. The reason the names are in the .FRM file is obvious when you see them. Some people may not have been around then, or been privy to this bit of info.</div>
<br />
<br />I see, no wonder. All of that information will not fit in the header. I also continue to use .FRM files with my rips. I think it's important to use those files. At least people will know that I ripped them, if anything is wrong they can contact me about said rip.
<br />
<br />Also, I got a list of NSFs that are contained within the newest NSF archive by Knurek. These are all commercial NSF rips on the list. Soon I'm going to post the list after I send him a couple that he's missing. I asked and he gave me permission a few days ago.
<br />
<br />Also, I would like to know if I can post your list on my site for reference to NSF sites and archive locations? I find the list very handy when I need to track down where an NSF is located at, and if it's been ripped or not. I would appreciate it.

<br />
<br />I also doubt that the game has 8 composers. I looked around the web and did not find any conclusive evidence. I bet you money, those people are part of the programming team, including the composer, I would imagine.
<br />
<br />The only way of knowing is opening the game in a hex editor, or trying to beat the game if the job of each in the game is not using the main font of the game.

<br />
<br />I've been unable so far to figure out what the problem is with track 10. All of the sequence data is there, all addresses are initialized now (the rip sounds better now, sure). 
<br />
<br />Usually I include all tracks in a game, unused or not. I have uncovered tracks in a few games, was apparent from a casual glance that the tunes were not used in the game.
<br />
<br />Since tracks 12 and 13 are glitch tracks, both of them shall be removed. I'm also going to try and track down the sound effect init call. Lately I've been trying to add sound effects to my rips.

<br />
<br />Alright, will do. Thanks for permission.
<br />
<br />More than likely I'll be adding the list along with my NSF update which I'm planning on doing Sunday afternoon, perhaps.
<br />
<br />I have a couple of fixes and some Russian NSFs to release.
