But, I did not mean only CC65 I mean other assemblers too, doing in whatever way work for those others assemblers.

However, with the old iNES format we would need to. Other formats do not require that, so a program could be made for conversion.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />It's not all emulator creators' fault though. The same old ROM files still circulate. There are still bad ROMs with !DISKDUDE in the header going around. It's not the emulator programmer's fault if you try to load a game like Startropics and it doesn't work right because the iNES 1.0 header says it is a MMC-3 game. Some will attempt to I.D. the game with a hash or checksum on some or all of the data. Others maybe only rely on iNES 2.0 to specific MMC-6 I suppose?

Then you combine it with the GoodNES people deciding to remove any mirroring information from mappers where mirroring is supposed to be hardware controlled, and you get crap like Mapper 4 RBI Baseball with Horizontal mirroring.
