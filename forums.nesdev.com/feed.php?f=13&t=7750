The phpBB software appears to have a bug -- or probably "a feature" that they thought was clever but is actually quite stupid.<br /><br />If you save your forum login/password credentials in your browser, then go to the phpBB configuration screen (for the entire forum), at the very bottom you'll find SMTP configuration details.  Defined there is a mail server, SMTP username (if needed), and SMTP password (if needed).<br /><br />The mail server is "localhost" (as it should be), but -- and here's the bug -- the username/password are auto-populated with your forum login/password values.  Yeah well, there is no SMTP user named "koitsu" with my password, so I imagine any mail <br /><br />This is probably happening because the phpBB people are re-using the same HTML form input field name as what's used in the login page.  The browser has no way to differentiate the two when it comes to storing login/password features.<br /><br />Why it was working previously but not now:<br /><br />Last night (after dealing with the nesdev wiki archival stuff), I noticed that the default timezone on the forum was still set to UTC-8 (we're in PDT right now, which is UTC-7, and this version of phpBB doesn't have DST support).  That option is stored in the same configuration page as the above SMTP details.  I changed it to UTC-7, clicked Submit, and thought nothing of it.  This obviously turned on SMTP authentication (with my forum credentials, which as I said have nothing to do with SMTP AUTH).<br /><br />So basically every time someone modifies something in the forum configuration section, they have to remember to clear the SMTP username and password fields before clicking Submit.<br /><br />I've gone ahead and done this, so mail notifications should work again.  But what a stupid, stupid, *stupid* bug.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3">koitsu</a> — Sat May 14, 2011 11:36 am</p><hr />

I posted <a href="http://nesdev.com/bbs/viewtopic.php?p=78138#78138" class="postlink">a comment</a>, and I got an error about sending mail, but the comment went through anyway. I'll try to save the exact error text next time.<br /><br />EDIT: I posted a comment here, and I got no error. It might happen only when someone has chosen to "Notify me when a reply is posted".<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=9">tepples</a> — Sat May 14, 2011 11:03 am</p><hr />
