		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Just a thought, if you want some randomness at powerup, why not take advantage of the initial lack of PPU/CPU synchronization?<br /><br />As we all know (<!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://wiki.nesdev.com/w/index.php/PPU_frame_timing">http://wiki.nesdev.com/w/index.php/PPU_frame_timing</a><!-- m -->), there is a technique to get the PPU and CPU clocks aligned. Would it be possible to do that and count how many cycles/frames/etc it took for things be aligned.<br /><br />This would at least give you a random value for each each of the 3 startup alignments (4 for PAL). Plus because the PPU and CPU use different dividers, most likely many more possible values.<br /><br />Obviously this only works on power up, not reset, but I am thinking of this more of an initial seed of sorts.<br /><br />Thoughts? Am I way off?

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I did some testing today and found that OAM is a pretty good source of entropy on my NES, at least for pressing reset on it and powering it down for varying lengths of time under 15 minutes. If I can set up an automatic timer to turn it on and off for a precise amount of time over and over all day, I'll get a better idea of how good it is.<br /><br />The ROM captures OAM at reset (after a 100 msec delay), prints its CRC-32 and content, then fills OAM with $FF to ensure that the next test's randomness can't be helped by this one's (this prevents it from merely acting like a pseudo RNG with the OAM storing its current state).<br /><br />If you run the ROM, be sure that your cart is really running it right when the NES powers up/resets, and not after a menu of any kind, otherwise the OAM will probably have been initialized by it before this gets to look at it.<br /><br />The text file tells a little more about the ROM and also has my results.

RESET is different, because the reset signal is also connected to the PPU.

It sure seems to be a great source of entropy at power.<br /><br />This test waits 100 msec before reading OAM. The routine should be tested running at a more typical time, the usual 1-2 refreshes after power up, in case for whatever reason we find less entropy at that time (earlier than I've been testing at).<br /><br />There's also the question of how to hash things. How many bits of entropy would typically be desired? I'm guessing just a byte, so the hash wouldn't need to be as involved as CRC-32. It should at least have a version that produces a byte, since users might try to &quot;optimize&quot; it down to a byte if it's more, and might break the hash and get some bits having very low entropy.

On the other hand, if the game isn't one like Freecell solitaire that needs all cards visible from frame one, it could use &quot;lazy shuffling&quot; where the Fisher-Yates routine hits the RNG only when the user requests that a card become visible. Klondike solitaire, for example, can get by with about 56 bits at power on: seven for the face-up card at the top of each fan on the tableau and three for cards pulled from stock to waste. Blackjack and Texas Hold'em poker likewise rarely deal more than one or two cards at a time. These bits could be added from sub-frame keypress timing, possibly gathered through DMC IRQ-triggered controller reading.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">It should at least have a version that produces a byte, since users might try to &quot;optimize&quot; it down to a byte if it's more, and might break the hash and get some bits having very low entropy.</div><br />Then run CRC-8 on the final result.

I've run it through a test that ensures that it's really reading all 256 bytes of OAM and incorporating each into the final value. The test ROM JSRs to it first thing, before <em>any</em> other init code, and it works fine, so there's little restriction on when it's called in init code. It just prints the entropy. The routine uses temp, a variable somewhere in RAM.<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">; In: PPU rendering disabled, OAM uninitialized<br />; Out: A=8 bits of entropy<br />; Preserved: Y<br />get_entropy_oam:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ldx #0<br />@next:&nbsp; stx $2003<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; eor $2004<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; sta temp<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; asl<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; bcc :+<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; eor #$07<br />:&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;eor temp<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; asl<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; bcc :+<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; eor #$07<br />:&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;eor temp<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; inx<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; bne @next<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; rts</div>

At one point, I realized that one of the species in the <em>Cheese</em> books was the same thing as a species from the first voyage in <em>Gulliver's Travels</em>. I briefly considered writing a <em>Cheese/Travels</em> crossover fic, and during my research for this, I became aware of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lilliput_and_Blefuscu" class="postlink">something else</a> that rhymes with Nintendo. So for the record I'll update my logo joke ROM to include two more possibilities. Modifying the included source code to read $2004 instead of $2007 is an exercise for the reader.<br /><br /><a href="http://pics.pineight.com/nes/pretendo-0.02.zip" class="postlink">http://pics.pineight.com/nes/pretendo-0.02.zip</a><br /><br />This leaves the Freecell problem, with a buttload of entropy needed up front. I've got a bunch of <a href="http://wiki.nesdev.com/w/index.php/File:Cards_32x24.png" class="postlink">cards</a>, and they need <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:FreeCell.png" class="postlink">shuffled face up</a>. Can oam_entropy.nes run its entropy gatherer more than once per reset? Does it work on models whose $2004 readback differs, such as the Famicom?
