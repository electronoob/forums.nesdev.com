<br />I don't think that he's bashing you.  He's not being rude.  IMHO, it is an honest assessment.
<br />
<br />Guys and Gals, have we beaten this issue enough?  It seems to me that the nesdev community (as a whole) is only really opposed to individuals attempting to make fake carts to swindle others with.  Everything else is a bit gray.  Can we just leave it at that and get back to coding?

Your invention is the idea that everyone asking wiring questions is trying to scam someone.  Except you can't even point to a single person here who has done that.  With how much of a massive problem you believe it to be that should be simple.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">Bregalad wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">you might be a guy who actually is a lot into that black market and that you are trying to get the NESdev communauty on your side so you could ask things to us and make profit on it.</div>
<br />But I haven't sold anything, haven't asked any reproduction related questions, and never expect to build any hardware at all (my brazing torch would fry boards!)  However if you ever notice I am trying to rip people off it would be the first and only example of your ideas!
<br />
<br />It may just be a translation issue, but that last part once again sounds like you are simply against profits.

<br />
<br />Obviously scamming people is against the law. The point is that 99.9999% of repros being made are not for scamming people. They are for people to play and collect games that are not available any other way. It IS insane to think that everything going on with these repros are for scamming people. The only scamming attempt I have ever heard of was a fake Stadium Events. The people that buy these games know exactly what they are getting. Not to mention most of the people asking these questions aren't even selling the games. They are making them for themselves.
<br />
<br />Like I quoted above, the site admin thinks it is just fine to ask these questions, so if you don't like it then just ignore it.
<br />
<br />On a side note, the only thing you ever need to watch out for is Stadium Events. It is the only game worth faking. Nothing else sells for high enough to justify the expense of making a fake of high enough quality to deceive anyone. Everyone knows that any prototype or translated game is just reproduction and therefore cannot be tricked.

<br />Final Fantasy 1, 2, 3, Dragon Warrior 2,3,4, Earthbound, Crystalis, maybe some others games are valuable enough...

With the PowerPak having no Nintendo copyrights/trademarks/patents (except debatably the Ciclone) it is not a simple thing to shut down.
