I certainly don't care what the color of the &quot;hiding bar&quot; is, just that it works and looks stable! *edit* The primary disadvantage of course would be having to make sure your palettes always work with this scheme. It might not be as bad as ensuring that one color of every four color sub-palette would have to match luminosity, because I think setting the monochrome bit does not get you 4 luminosities of gray, I recall at least two of them always collapsing together and showing the same gray.

If you're keeping sprites enabled you don't have to worry about it. Disabling the PPU for good (both sprites and BG) has the annoying side effect of corrupting OAM (this was discovered by tepples a while ago) unless you obey some mystical conditions (like the exact point in the scanline where you do it or which sprites are visible in that scanline).<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">What if we never disable rendering, upload a black palette by the end of vblank, then wait for enough cycles to black out the top 16 scanlines, and then upload the correct palette?</div><br />To update the palette you have to fully disable rendering, so you run into that OAM corruption issue again.

It seems to constantly move around o_O;</div><br />Without an scanline counter, the most common way to sync with the PPU is with sprite 0 hits: the PPU sets a bit when a solid pixel in sprite 0 overlaps a solid pixel in the background. If the game scroll horizontally and vertically, it gets hard to guarantee that there will be a solid background pixel where the sprite is unless you intentionally put a solid tile there. This is what this game does, and it ends up looking like an annoying glitch.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">GradualGames wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">and set the monochrome bit</div><br />Now there's a good idea! Having to use a constant luminosity at a certain palette slot is not such a bad limitation. Sounds to me like a great solution.

It takes 64 dots to start the sprite evaluator each line, 128 to check whether all are in range, and 6 more for each that is in range.

It just waits for the 16 pixel column to be fully visible and then sets the palette - <em>blatantly</em> noticeable. At least it disables the leftmost 8 pixels column so the glitches are only in the palette and not in the tiles (also it's doing horizontal mirroring, here we're looking for vertical mirroring).

Humans can only focus on small spots, and we use our blurry peripheral vision to detect movement, and when that happens we move our eyes to focus on the area where the movement occurred. When I'm playing and some blocks suddenly change color at the edge of the screen, my brain thinks something is happening over there, so I look at the glitches. My peripheral vision keeps noticing them, and they keep distracting me... I actually have to force myself to ignore the popping colors in order to play games like SMB3 and Kirby's Adventure (which I love, despite this problem). I don't know if this is just me, but it's enough for me to not want this in my own games.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">I don't think it is worth an overly complex solution to hide minor graphics glitches.</div><br />Vertical glitches are minor only in NTSC I think, I remember people saying that they are very noticeable on PAL.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">Also wouldn't just wiring up a SRAM for 4 screen mirroring solve the issue too?

If it is as cheap as you guys have mentioned here in this thread, I'll proably go that route. I have a vague memory though of being told that could be more expensive than 1$, but I'll have to look into it again.<br /><br />If that doesn't work though, yes, I am tempted to just leave it as-is and rely on NTSC overscan. I have one crt tv which just barely shows the top of the updated row at the bottom of the screen. It's not even as bad as SMB3 or Kirby, so I'll probably be happy with this if none of these other solutions pan out. I definitely am enjoying learning how to make this work should I choose to stick with it, though.<br /><br />Tokumaru, why are you not happy with NTSC overscan the way Super Bat Puncher does? Just that some tvs might show a little of the updates?

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />4-screen mirroring can't hide the sprites-pop up glitches at the left nor at the top of the screen.<br /><br />As I said the only way to get <strong><em>100% clean</em></strong> scrolling is to hide the leftmost and top most 8 pixels. Then, if vertical mirroring or 8x16 sprites are used (or both), the top 16 pixels should be hidden, otherwise, if horizontal mirroring is used there should instead hide the right most 8 pixels too with sprites.<br /><br />Therefore, the only purpose of 4-screen mirroring is that you could hide only the left 8 and top 8 pixels if you use 8x8 sprites, and if you use 8x16, there is no difference whenever you use 4-screen or vertical mirroring (since you should hide the top 16 scanlines anyways).<br /><br />Now whenever you actually <strong>want </strong>100% clean scrolling is another story.

I don't care as much about sprite popping because that's so brief and near the edge of the screen. But if the whole updated row of a nametable is visible you have a veritable light show on your hands. So, if I end up perfecting any of those issues, it will be scrolling.

Most of my projects have pretty sunny levels, which makes the glitches more noticeable. Also, from what I've heard, PAL consoles/TVs don't crop any of the picture at the top and bottom, so all glitches are fully visible.

But it's not too bad. Stick a 16KB RAM on there and have at it, I guess?<br /><br />But still, IMO, software patching and making the screen off-center just to fix it are worse design choices than giving up a tiny bit of your profit. If you're not using custom boards, then software is the best way. But if you can develop a PCB, then just stick a 4KB RAM in a devtendo and start going at it. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />
