<br />Do you think it's possible to do 3-D scrolling on the NES? Could you just scale the sprites like Super Mario Kart or 3-D World Runner? Thanks. 
<br />
<br />Also, has anybody else had trouble with NESICIDE? It often crashes and ruins the project file, so I save 3 copies... but it's getting old.

<br />Are you using the version available on gitorious.org or the version available on <!-- w --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.nesicide.com">www.nesicide.com</a><!-- w --> [downloads]?  The latter is almost a year and a half old...I haven't kept up that domain.
<br />
<br />What type of crashes?  I'm currently busy porting NESICIDE into Qt [with essial, but he seems to have gone AWOL] but could take a look if I had some hint as to what you were doing that was causing crashes.
<br />
<br />If you try the version available on gitorious.org [NESICIDE, not NESICIDE2&lt;--this is the Qt porting] it allows you to link to an external assembler such as ASM6 or...but I never tried it...NESASM.  I'd be interested if that makes things better.  Plus, the version on gitorious.org is up-to-date from when the Qt porting activity started which was late last year.

<br />SMK doesn't scale the sprites; it has sprites already scaled in the ROM just like Rad Racer. And doing this with the NES's 25% sprite overdraw will just be a flicker-fest.

<br />
<br />But since you describe yourself as a newbie nes programmer I would recommend going with something easier for your first nes project.
<br />
<br />3d on the nes haven't been done that many times, so you'd pretty much be on your own.

<br />NESICIDE 1 was started six years ago when I had VS 6.  I have only just recently got VS 2008 for work.  I have not tried compiling it there...off I go.  If I can fix the 43 errors I will commit the fix.
<br />
<br />EDIT: It appears I have VS2008 express which doesn't include MFC...maybe I'll push for 2008 standard which does, or so I read.

<br />Make a puzzle game. It's what everyone else does.

<br />ROM hack your copy of Balloon Fight to replace the player sprite with a triangle the spark sprite with a cube and you'll understand. My point is that the game type exists in an NES launch title, albeit presented with different graphics. Furthermore: "I remember playing Balloon Fight's main mode in the arcade back when it was called Joust."
