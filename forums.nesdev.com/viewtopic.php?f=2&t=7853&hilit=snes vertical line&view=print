		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />All this NTSC signal stuff and dot crawl stuff has always been chineese for me. But today I just throught I HAD to understand this.
<br />
<br />If I understand well the color signal is anything above 3.5 MHz and it's phase determine the color while the amplitude determine the saturation.
<br />
<br />The luminous signal would be anything below 3.5 MHz and simply put the voltage directly represent the luminous intensity.
<br />
<br />The problem is that the NES renders pixels at 5MHz, which is higher than the 3.5 MHz color subcarier.
<br />So for example if I put a single colored pixel in a completely dark area it can't look the right color, because the color signal isn't active long enough so that the TV can determine it's phase, so it will be some "random" color.
<br />
<br />Did I get it right ?
<br />If not someone please explain, this aspect of the NES is really what's truly lacking in my knownledge...

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />You've got the right idea.
<br />
<br />On NTSC or PAL/M, the luma (brightness signal) is nominally 0-3.0 MHz and the chroma (color signal) is 3.0-4.2 MHz. Each pixel on a ColecoVision, NES, SMS, or Super NES is 2/3 of an NTSC color subcarrier cycle wide, which isn't necessarily enough to communicate the color of an isolated pixel. Atari 2600, on the other hand, uses pixels that are a whole cycle wide, so they don't suffer from quite the same problem. In theory, it would be possible to synchronize to the NES's pixel clock and recover the phase exactly, but standard TVs aren't designed for such synchronization.
<br />
<br />European PAL uses higher frequencies such that each NES pixel takes 5/6 of a color subcarrier cycle.

<br />
<br />On a NES, if you'd somehow restrict yourself to graphics where couples of 2 horizontally neightboor pixels are always the same color (something common on the C64 known as "multicolor mode"), you'd get no artefacts/dot crawl on screen ?
<br />
<br />What about systems with an even higher horizontal resolution than the NES, such as the PS1 in high res, PS2 or the <span class="posthilit">SNES</span> in modes 5&amp;6 ? Does they need 4 or so pixels in order for them to be shown with the correct color ?!?

On the 2600 the narrowest pixels, if alternating between two not-too-similar colors, will exceed that. This is even true with one that's had the s-video mod, like in the image I found at the bottom of  <a href="http://www.vintagegamingandmore.com/" class="postlink">http://www.vintagegamingandmore.com/</a><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">What about systems with an even higher horizontal resolution than the NES, such as the PS1 in high res, PS2 or the <span class="posthilit">SNES</span> in modes 5&amp;6 ? Does they need 4 or so pixels in order for them to be shown with the correct color ?!?</div> Well, it's more that they will become a almost uniform color once bandlimited in NTSC. You can see examples at <a href="http://www.chrismcovell.com/gotRGB/screenshots.html" class="postlink">http://www.chrismcovell.com/gotRGB/screenshots.html</a>, and that's only for the 256 or 320 pixel wide modes.
<br />
<br />The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NTSC#Transmission_modulation_scheme" class="postlink">wikipedia page on NTSC</a> talks about the bandwidth considerations, and the discussion I had <a href="http://nesdev.com/bbs/viewtopic.php?t=7821" class="postlink">here</a> talks about how the television can do other tricks to try to recover a better separation between luma and chroma.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />OK so basically a NTSC video singal is a normal (monochrome) video signal, added with a 3.5 MHz sine wave, right ?
<br />The amplitude of this sine would be saturation and it's phase color.
<br />
<br />Then the TV does a very high order band-cut filter at 3.5 MHz to remove color information from the luminance signal ?
<br />
<br />Also if the color changes during the image rendering without any grey area in-between, this means the phase will shift quickly, and then harmonics above 3.5 MHz will appear. Is that those who causes the infamous "dot crawl" ? I think it's the case because this appear at color changes.
<br />
<br />So an image rendered by a NES where ALL the palettes are the same hue (from the same "column" of the palette), no dot crawl or artifacts appear, right ?
<br />
<br />Also because the NES uses square wave instead of sine wave for the color-burst, this makes even more harmonics appear. The first harmonic would be at 3*3.5 = 10.5 MHz, right ? That would be about the width of a pixel in a 480p/480i resolution image, so does this causes problems ?

<br />TVs that I've used appear to have a low-pass filter on their analog inputs to block details that are way out of the SDTV nominal bandwidth. An Apple IIe in 80-column text mode, for example, looks a lot sharper through an AppleColor Composite Monitor IIe than through a television (where 80-column text is nearly unreadable).

<br />Finally there is another thing I don't understand. Look at the red rectangle arround the subweapon in Castlevania 1 (or 3 doesn't matter).
<br />Normally all the red pixels are directly neightboor with black pixels.
<br />Black is a low DC voltage, while red would be an oscillating signal at 3.5 MHz, with a phase that would make it red, and a DC offset that would make it bright, right ?
<br />Then there is absolutely no confusion possible, no other colors or luminosities arround, but the rectangle still looks like it has "sawtooth" on it. Why ?

<br />Colors $1x alternate level $10 (light gray) with $1D (black). So we have a bunch of tiny light gray dots in the "red" spaces and a bunch of black dots in the "cyan" spaces, which get decoded to a red hue.
