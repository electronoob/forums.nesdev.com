For one thing, it would need a lot more &quot;internal operation&quot; cycles for address generation, such as adding base addresses to indexes in <tt style="margin-left: 2px; margin-right: 2px; padding:3px; background-color: #3355aa; color: white;">LDA aaaa,X</tt>. There'd be no more hiding address generation in phase 1 for indexed loads that don't cross a page. The HuC6280 indeed uses an extra cycle for unindexed direct page and absolute addressing, and it has the page crossing penalty cycle for indexing even if no page is crossed. But with more pipelining, as seen in ARM and friends, I guess it could use that internal operation cycle to fetch the first byte of the next instruction.

Their memory controllers include a multiplexer to let the video hardware access memory during phase 1 and the CPU access the same memory during phase 2. I agree that it's not ideal when CPU and VDC/VDP/PPU are in separate address spaces. But more engineering time spent on making the 65816 into a 1-phase CPU would have detracted from engineering time to get things like multiplane scrolling, color math, and affine background transformation working on the PPU.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Decimal mode has all of two instructions devoted to it - SED and CLD.  That's not very many addressing modes for a hypothetical ADD.<br /><br />Even if you were to remove all instructions dealing with the status register except REP and SEP (this includes SEC and CLC), you still wouldn't be at parity with ADC, which has 15 opcodes devoted to it.  You could use WDM as a prefix instruction, but that's kinda pointless as it takes just as long as CLC or SEC.  It's only one byte, so maybe you could redesign the chip a bit to handle it in one cycle, but it's still slower than having an actual ADD, and it doesn't save any memory vs. the current setup.<br /><br />This is one reason why a fully 16-bit 65xx could have been good.  As many opcodes as you want, on top of doubled bus throughput, or (nearly) quadrupled if you were to go to 1-phase.  Imagine <em>that</em> in the SNES...  Apple would never have agreed to use it in the IIGS because it would have made the Macintosh look sick, even with the 2-phase design it would probably have needed for that application...<br /><br />...<br /><br />Just thought of something - maybe you could replace the decimal mode bit with an ignore carry bit.  Then again, that seems cumbersome and error-friendly...

If you don't care about binary backwards compatibility you could just swap it so that ADD is the regular instruction, and ADC requires the prefix. Regular addition would get one byte smaller, and 16-bit/32-bit addition would remain the same size (CLC, ADC, ADC ---&gt; ADD, prefix, ADD)

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />That's actually how the Super FX works.  The ADD Rn instruction is one byte, with four bits for the opcode and four for the operand register Rn, while ADC Rn is a macro instruction consisting of ALT1 followed by ADD Rn.  Using ALT2 instead of ALT1 gets you ADD #n, an immediate add with a 4-bit operand, and ALT3 turns it into ADC #n.<br /><br />The Super FX is another example of a 16-bit chip that would have benefited massively from 16-bit external busing...
