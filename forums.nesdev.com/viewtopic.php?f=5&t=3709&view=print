		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />What are pirate NES games you would recommend - modern unlicensed games in particular, released after the NES/Famicom's lifetime?  While there are a lot of pirate games that have poor graphics, poor sound, or poor gameplay (usually all in one), I found a few that I liked:
<br />
<br /><a href="http://forums.lostlevels.org/viewtopic.php?t=1266" class="postlink"><strong>Buzz and Waldog</strong></a> is an SMW-clone.  While it stole its sound engine and some of its sound effects from Konami games, it has original music.  The game has simplistic, cartoonish graphics, but they're very colorful and are well-executed.  The controls and gameplay feel like an actual-licensed game - this game's collision detection is impressively decent for a pirate game.
<br />
<br /><a href="http://cah4e3.shedevr.org.ru/dumping_2005.php" class="postlink"><strong>Tiny Toon Adventures 6/Porky Pig &amp; Daffy Duck</strong></a> is a port of a GB game, according to reading 
<br /><a href="http://forums.lostlevels.org/viewtopic.php?t=708&amp;sid=7857485bd183e2133346c51a918dd640" class="postlink">a thread from Lost Levels</a>.  Most of the graphics and all of the sound and music are stolen from the two NES Tiny Toon games - the other graphics may be ripped from other Tiny Toons games or are original.  While there are a few glitches in the game, the graphics, sound, and gameplay are all pretty smooth.
<br />
<br /><a href="http://youtube.com/watch?v=23NmExnQcMo" class="postlink"><strong>Street Fighter III</strong></a> is a misleading port of Street Fighter II.  While the music isn't really very good, the gameplay graphics are gorgeous IMO.  However, the other graphics aren't as good.  Ken's sprite is a palette swap of Ryu, Blanka only uses three colors while the other characters use 6, and the gameplay is noticably slower-paced than usual.  However, the gameplay and controls are still smooth and this is definitely a playable game IMO.
<br />
<br /><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oFldXemN-XM" class="postlink"><strong>Final Fight 3/Garou Densetsu Special</strong></a> is a port of Final Fight III.  The music and sound effects are directly stolen from Mighty Final Fight, but everything else is original.  The graphics are pretty colorful and well drawn - but when more than four objects (barrels, cans, items, characters, etc.) are on the screen, the game starts to flicker through all of them.  This is because the game assigns each object with its own 1KB CHR bank - this sort of limits the action.  But the gameplay and controls are still pretty smooth and really well done.

<br />I guess so, but I had modern unlicensed games in mind - that is, games that were released for the NES/Famicom after its lifetime.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Another pretty decent pirate game I played was <strong><a href="http://youtube.com/watch?v=791_BCc8beM" class="postlink">Aladdin</a></strong>, a port of the SNES version.
<br />
<br />The video is of a certain version of the game converted to MMC3, it only supports one version and most of the music is gone.  The ROM names for that version are "Aladdin 4 (1995) (Unl) [!]", and " Aladdin 4 (1996) (Unl) [!]" - I think they're both the same.
<br />
<br />There are two complete versions of the game, with the original mapper 90 (JY Company's mapper), and the ability to swap between two title screens.  One is switchable between Aladdin and Aladdin II, AFAIK they're only different in the title screen - the ROM name for this is "Aladdin (Unl)".  The other is switchable between Aladdin III and Popeye 2: Travels in Persia - Popeye 2 turns Aladdin to Popeye, but that's it.  The ROM name for that is "Popeye 2: Travels in Persia (Unl) [!]".
<br />
<br />That said, the game's graphics are gorgeous.  Specifically the BGs - watch the demos, these are IMO some of the best graphics ever on the NES.  Sprites are also pretty decent too - although some of the enemies are too brown and have weird outlines.  Music is so-so - but it is pretty decent for a pirate game.  Gameplay is also pretty good, the controls are decent except for jumping - it gets pretty slippery there, and it's sometimes hard to jump with the distance you want.  Otherwise, this is a pretty playable pirate game - it's definitely better than <a href="http://youtube.com/watch?v=ik9XyRG3w6U&amp;feature=related" class="postlink">Virgin's version on PAL</a> - big time in the graphics department - and puts it to shame.

<br />Somari uses MMC3 (or a clone), IIRC. If the physics didn't suck so bad it would be an OK game.

<br />Were did you find pirate Contra 3 ?? I couldn't find any.
<br />And SF3 has just SF2 graphics with less colours, it's true that it looks impressive, but the pirate didn't make them. Gameplay isn't as good however.

It does feel a little chunky controls-wise, noticeably slower-paced than usual.  I'm not sure if it's just me, but I lose all my lives within a minute with the default 3 lives setting...and it seems a lot harder than either Contra or Super C.  Regardless, it's actually pretty OK with 30 lives - I have a different dump of the same game Celius posted up, "Contra Spirits" instead of "Super Contra 3" and allows for 12 or 30 lives.
<br />
<br />There's actually a nice parallax effect in the intro, and the second level has some parallax scrolling clouds.  That impressed me for a pirate game.
