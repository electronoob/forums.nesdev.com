And you clearly don't seem to be one.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">If you want a complete ROM hack that changes 100% of the ROM then you might as well write a new game.</div>
<br />
<br />Agreed.  But ROM hacks don't ever change 100%, that's the point.  That doesn't mean multiple ROM hacks won't collectively change 100% (ie:  what one ROM hacker decides to change, another might decide to keep, and vice versa).
<br />
<br />
<br />And let's not forget the value disassemblies have to homebrewers.  Examining other game's sources can be a very useful tool.  I can't tell you how much examining other emulators' sources have helped when making my first emulators.  And seeing how a game does a specific effect, or how it handles specific edge cases, or how it stores certain information, etc, etc, can all be useful to know when designing your own game.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Disch, what's a ROM hacker? Bregalad "hacked" Contra's japanese version from Konami VRC to Nintendo MMC3. He also was working on doing a similar hack for Gradius 2. Seems much like real hacking to me. 
<br />
<br />But I do think that it helps to disasm games and make fully commented and buildable source code, if you can spare the huge amount of time it takes to do that. In the end it's up to who does it if it is worth the effort and time to them. Personally I wouldn't bother with that sort of effort unless I planned to do some huge hack of the game myself. 
<br />
<br />I do think it is helpful to see how some games did various small parts of the game so that homebrew developers can benefit from that.

<br />
<br />From a homebrewer perspective, If we could extract some of those tricks done in various games in some kind of code repository that we could search about a specific subject, that would be great.  
<br />
<br />The problem is to take the time to extract that information and what information is really valuable since "valuable" is quite subjective.  In brief, something similar to Bootgod database but for coding.  I would be reading that site all the time I guess  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_lol.gif" alt=":lol:" title="Laughing" />

<br />How do disassemble-hack-reassemble modders distribute "patches" against the original copyrighted ROM in this case?

<br />
<br />They just distribute the ROM usually. But you could always write a program to do the patching on an original ROM, moving data around and such. I did that for my Splatterhouse SD mapper hack as massive amounts of data were changed and if I used an IPS patch then the patch itself would have included almost all the CHR.
