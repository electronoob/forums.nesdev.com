Well I remember there being a glitch originally with MCK that didn't allow arpeggio macros above a certain point, maybe A5 or something.  Probably something to do with high writes.  There was a "fixed" version but knowing the original MCK it was likely a small patch to a gaping hole of a problem.<br /><br />On another note the version of Notso that I have plays them fine (including explode).  It's version 0.851.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=34">RushJet1</a> — Sat Jul 11, 2009 5:31 pm</p><hr />

I've used my NSF player in ZSNES to make a few guitar tabs.  It was easiest with ZSNES's "increment frame" feature.  I should have put that feature in the player itself, but didn't.<br /><br />Logs may be useful.  There is also the NESA format, which was a logged music format before NSFs took over.<br /><br />I hacked Festalon NSF plug-in once, I'm a C newb but it was pretty easy (I redirected sound writes to the PC serial port for my NES to play in realtime).<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=10">Memblers</a> — Fri Jul 10, 2009 7:00 pm</p><hr />

I didn't know about that.  I will give it a try and see how it react.  This could be useful when trying to re-track some songs in FT.<br /><br />For some sound fx, I thought about an idea but I'm not sure yet how difficult it will be to implement. I'm thinking to check the code for an existing nsf player like nsfplug and add some debug logs when writing to the registers. This way, I can re-use the real raw data inside my code.  I know some of the players you can see the memory but that's a pain to look at it and write down the data by hand.  I will see if I can make the process simpler (if I can find the time). <br /><br />That will be useful for one of my project. I don't know (if I made it), if it can be useful for other people.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3559">Banshaku</a> — Fri Jul 10, 2009 6:42 pm</p><hr />

I would then sample the same part from my famitracker recreation, and visually compare the samples. I was then able to fix anything that was wrong using that as a reference.<br /><br />This method can ensure that you nail volumes, duty cycles, and arpeggios.

The notes shown in nsfplay are not the same of famitracker so I can only rely on my ears.<br /><br />For pitch, what I do is check the frequencies made by the original song in nsfplay then check after that my song is exactly the same in some situation. I'm very picky on pitch.<br /><br />One example that I was trying to do recently is to remake the simple song of mm2 when you get a weapon (track #17 of the nsf).  Kick drum could be remade in FT with a pitch of | 15 (learned that from Tssf examples) and it will sound similar BUT not the same if you listen closely: The pitch is wrong and you cannot adjust it manually for the complete song.  Why is that so?  Because the pitch counter is not constant and change based on which frequency it start.<br /><br />Here's what I got so far by trying to read the very fast frequency change even at x8:<br /><br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">First kick:<br /><br />Frequency : 244, 228, 214, 201, 190, 181, 172, 164, 156<br />Pitch slide:     16,  14 , 13 , 11,   9,  9,   8,   8<br /><br />Second kick:<br />Frequency: 559, 482,  423,  377, 341, 310, 285, 263, 245,  229, 215,  202, 191, 181 , 172, 164, 157, 150, 144<br />Pitch slide:     77    59    46   36   31   25   22   18    16   14   13    11   10    9     8    7   7    6<br /><br /></div><br /><br />This is what I found so far.  And in that, the sound seems cut too. Maybe you would say "why do you care so much, |15 sounds good enough no?". Yes, it can sound good enough for some but it's not perfect.  I hate to be a perfectionist some time.  <br /><br />For now I took a break on this specific song. At least I go the exact notes but not pitch perfect yet.  If I focus only on that small details, I will never finish to remake the songs I need for my project..<br /><br />Maybe I will modify the source code of nsfplug and see if I can make it slower.<br /><br />@RushJet1:<br />Cool, some megaman fx!
