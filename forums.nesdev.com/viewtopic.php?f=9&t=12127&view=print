		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" /><strong>story</strong>:<br />ok, so I got a brand new retro entertainment system (which is exactly the same as the retron 1 in terms of the hardware), and I wanted to modify it so that it only plays famicom games and give it to my friend on christmas as she have always wanted a famicom but didn't have the will to buy one XP<br />I got it in the mail today, and I tested it out. It didn't work. <br /><strong>issue</strong>:<br />It doesn't turn on. It only turns on when there is no cartridge inserted, and it shows weird ghostly shapes on the screen. my other RES doesn't do that at all. it works just fine, in fact. HOW CAN I FIX IT PLEASE HALP!!!!!!

The company that makes it is named <a href="http://hyperkin.com/retron-1-nes-gaming-system-black.html" class="postlink">Hyperkin</a> (they also make a white-and-red version).  <a href="http://hyperkin.com/contact-us" class="postlink">Contact them</a> for support; this forum has no relation to Hyperkin or their products (you're free to discuss them here, but this is not where you get support for Hyperkin products).<br /><br />2. I don't think it matters where you bought it, though if you bought it used that may be a problem.  Furthermore, Hyperkin sells stuff directly on Amazon.<br /><br />3. If you still don't like the product, <strong>send it back to Amazon!</strong>  They can exchange it with another one free of charge (you pay no shipping fees), otherwise just send it back and get your money refunded.  If the replacement has the same issue, they'll refund your money as well.  It's that simple.  Amazon is one of the few companies left in the United States who is <strong>extremely</strong> good about refunding a customer's money.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I'm guessing if you look inside it, you're not going to see much other than a cartridge connector and an blob of epoxy.  Unless you see something obviously wrong, broken wires or something, it's probably not going to be fixable.  It's really be faster to just return it.  If you can open it without breaking a warranty, it won't hurt to look inside but I doubt it would help.<br /><br />I don't have any of the newer clones, but with Retro Bit I can say I bought their NES controller extension cables to compare to 2 other manufacturers, and the Retro Bit cables were by far the shittiest, with unbelievably small wire gauge.  I would avoid their stuff, if the build quality is this bad.
