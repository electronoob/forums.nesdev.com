Doesn't seem worth spending any time on, along with all the other really obscure things that aren't currently worth the time it takes to figure them out.<br /><br />And yeah, just duplicate the last 16K PRG bank and increase the PRG count; it knows how many banks there are and won't go past the last test. Future releases should be more standard, as I've finally gotten it through my head that iNES isn't a "build-your-own-board" format, rather a "specify-something-that-can-exist" format. So I'll be using NROM for 32K PRG/8K CHR tests, UNROM for 32K PRG/0K CHR, and MMC1 with a power-of-two PRG size for the multi tests. Hopefully that will be compliant with everything.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=17">blargg</a> — Fri Oct 15, 2010 4:11 pm</p><hr />

Which of the test roms are you using.<br /><br />He posted  version 5 in this thread<br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://nesdev.com/bbs/viewtopic.php?t=3831">http://nesdev.com/bbs/viewtopic.php?t=3831</a><!-- m --><br /><br />I also cannot figure out how to get  9C and 9E working.  In the above post, blargg alluded that he would likely just remove those opcodes altogether.<br /><br />edit- the reason I ask which version is that version 5 is 265K in size, and the header indicates 16 PRG and 1 CHR bank which should satify the problem of 15 banks you mentioned.<br /><br />Al<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=772">albailey</a> — Fri Oct 15, 2010 11:43 am</p><hr />

I thought for fun I'd finish up implementing all the instructions into my NES CPU by adding the last 4 or 5 that I didn't add before.<br /><br />Anyways, 2 opcodes still don't work properly and I am not sure why.  These are 9Ch and 9Eh.  Both are "undefined" opcodes which do different things depending on which source you check.  I know that it doesn't really matter *too* much if they don't work right but I'd like to have them function properly.<br /><br />Other than that, everything else is Great Success(tm).<br /><br />Blargg, can you make a 256K version of that integrated test ROM some time like the others?  The current one is short a PRG bank (15 instead of 16) so I cannot run it.  Unless duplicating the last bank or something will fix it.  Thanks in advance if ya do.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=230">kevtris</a> — Fri Oct 15, 2010 7:28 am</p><hr />
