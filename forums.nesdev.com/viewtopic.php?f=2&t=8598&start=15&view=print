		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I have mixed feelings about english language. It's true you can say things shorter, and I think french is gramatically close to portugeese, something like "memory-mapped register" is shorter than "registre aloué en mémoire".
<br />Some computer science like "scrolling", "buffer", "sprite", "frame" or "bankswitching" are just untranslatable ! Or if a translation exist it just suck, for example "scrolling" could translate in "défilement" but this sounds weird so I just use the english words and I end up with "frenglish".
<br />Then there is also other non-computer science related words, such as "Snowboard", "Skateboard", which are untranslatable (read : all attempts at translating them have failed) so this is nothing new.
<br />By the way it's funny some untranslatable words are transated with another, unrelated, english word. For example "sneakers" translate in french to "baskets", so everyone here thinks "baskets" means "shoes" in english, and it's a big shock when you learn it's not the case !
<br />
<br />Back on the subject, it might not sounds like it for you guys, but I'm really not all that good in english and it takes some throught for me to read and write something in english language, when I can just type down my throught in french without thinking and read it back, it'd be useless to do all the effort to do it in english if nobody is ever reading my code.
<br />
<br />Especially since I don't comment much technical stuff (because  it's obvious at looking the code) but more what I tried to do and what routines does... and this is quickly complex to write in english for me.
<br />
<br />I agree that plain text support for non-english characters suck. Again, the ego-centrist of americans at it's peak. It's common I have problem with accented charatrers, which are not avoidable in french language. You can write without them but it looks weird. However if I use accented caracters with notepad++, and always use notepad++, chances are this won't be a problem.

"Sprite" in computer graphics is translated as "sprite" on fr.wp. As for "bank switching", Wikipedia's article links to "expanded memory", a standard for bankswitched RAM expansion on 8086 PCs, and the French term for that is "mémoire paginée" (paged memory). The <em>Nintendo Power</em> article about how Game Paks work uses a "pages" analogy as well:<br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">To understand Bank Switching, picture a game as one page in a story book. The first thing you'll notice is that you can only write so much on a single page. A one page story might be okay, but if you want to expand the story, you'll need to add more pages. It's the same with games. Program size is limited, but you can add programs to the chip. Bank Switching allows you to have several programs in one chip. When a new area of the game is reached, you'll automatically switch to the appropriate program,  which is useful in big game with many variations or worlds.</div><br />Extending the "one page story" analogy, where NROM games are like short stories and UNROM/MMC1/MMC3 games like novels, would turn a multicart into a short story anthology and WarioWare microgames into flash fiction. But now I'm way off on a tangent.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"> Or if a translation exist it just suck, for example "scrolling" could translate in "défilement"</div><br />Yeah, a lot of French technical terms have "interesting" connotations. A "buffer overflow", for example, is "dépassement de tampon". In English, a "tampon" is a cloth plug to absorb menstrual fluid.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">For example "sneakers" translate in french to "baskets", so everyone here thinks "baskets" means "shoes" in english, and it's a big shock when you learn it's not the case !</div><br />Probably a contraction of "shoes for basketball".<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">if nobody is ever reading my code.</div>
<br />So pretty much your entire answer to the question of this poll is likely to depend on the answer to another question: "Do I expect someone not sharing my native language to collaborate with me on this project?"

<br />In french too, so that's why we continues to say "buffer" even when speaking french  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt=":roll:" title="Rolling Eyes" />
<br />You now see why I see sometimes the proposed translation sucks. Some words translates well some does not.

<br />
<br />But even on GNU/Linux, I have quite a unpleasent memories of a Python IDE being totally confused about line numbers when debugging due to just a few of my comments using Swedish characters, and thus needing multiple bytes with UTF encoding.
<br />
<br />Usually I always write my comments in English though, and the above experience just gave me yet another (although pretty silly) reason to stick to this principle.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I thought everyone always wrote their docs in Japanese...
<br />
<br />Actually, I'm a native English speaker, so I don't really have an answer to this question. Personally I appreciate the effort non-native speakers make to put comments, code, documentation, forum posts, etc. into English. But I don't feel that they have too. (On the other hand, it is easier to get help if you do...)
<br />
<br />It's sad that Unicode support is still so badly implemented that many feel that they cannot use their native language, even if they want to. UTF-8 seems to be nearly universal on the web (when Unicode is used), but Windows (when it's not using ASCII or something) uses UTF-16. There are libraries to handle both (and many other encodings), such as one from IBM, but they don't seem to see much use.
<br />
<br />I would be curious as to the level of Unicode support available in the various tools produced and used by the community.

<br />Then again, I have seen it fail to draw certain characters (like ①) if there are no other Unicode characters on the same line...
<br />
<br />Also, from the Japanese code I've seen, code is often in English, comments are usually in Japanese.  Sometimes variables are in English, often times they are in Romaji, and in languages that allow it, sometimes Kanji.

<br />Variable names are (mostly) in english though.
<br />
<br />And does any language really accept Kanjis ?!!? I'd already by surprised if they accepted kanas. Well maybe kanjis can make their variables name shorter if they can replace words by a single kanji.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Most modern languages allow for non-ASCII characters only in comments and strings, not in identifiers. Older languages generally don't support character encodings larger than eight bits at all.
<br />
<br />Theoretically, a language (or language extension) could use the character type information present in the Unicode database to be fully internationalizable or localizable, but I'm not aware of any that does. (Although I'd be really surprised if there's not at least a few.) A lighter weight solution would be to treat any character outside a specific reserved set as allowed in identifiers. This could create potential ambiguities with allowing punctuation and variant space characters in identifiers, but such could be prohibited by coding standards instead.
