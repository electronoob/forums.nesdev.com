<br />Just 1 whole screen uncompressed.
<br />
<br />(256/16)*(240/16)
<br />16*15 = 240.
<br />
<br />Or (256/16)*(256/16) = 256
<br />if your "screens" are defined as 256x256 like mine are.
<br />
<br />I use 32x32 metatiles because I only have 1 page of RAM allocated to this, and I need 4 screens stored. I store my screens in RAM because otherwise I would have to battle through a few levels of compression to check every point. This method lets me do the time consuming stuff (working through the RLE compression of the screens) only on the frame a new screen is scrolled to, while the fast decompression (which 16x16 tile of the 32x32 tile are we in?) is done every time a point needs to be checked. 
<br />
<br />If it is not time consuming to decompress your data, you could certainly just read from ROM rather than doing what I do.
<br />
<br />If it is time consuming, you can get away with using only two pages of RAM to store separate screens of 16x16 tiles for this method since your game only scrolls horizontally.

<br />16x13 is used by Nintendo on SMB1... They know awesome things!  That's a savings of 96 bytes right?  That's quite a lot! <img src="./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" />

<br />16 is the height of a metatile. When you divide by 16 you get the number of metatiles in each column, and with that you can calculate how many bytes a screen would take if stored uncompressed in RAM.
<br />
<br />The fact that there are hidden scanlines doesn't mean every game has to do anything special about them. Most games show parts of the map in those areas normally, they just don't put important objects or structures there, but there's usually <strong>something</strong> there.

<br />
<br />You divide by 16 because that's the metatile size. You subtract the height of the status bar (32) from the screen height (240) and divide by the metatile height (16). You get 13. 
<br />You divide the screen width (256) by the metatile width (16). You get 16. 
<br />
<br />So, 16x13 is how much many bytes of RAM a screen takes up in Super Mario Bros. (According to Tepples, I haven't checked myself).
<br />
<br />It's only related to the the possibilty of scanlines being hidden as a cause/effect thing. Super Mario Bros. probably couldn't store its "MARIO WORLD TIME" at the VERY top of the screen, because some TVs might cut it off. If there was just map up there, it wouldn't matter if it got cut off. But it wasn't, so they moved the bar down which happened to have the bonus of saving some extra RAM/ROM. Since the top of the screen is scroll locked to keep the status bar from moving, nothing solid could be put there anyway since it would look strange not scrolling. 
<br />
<br />I've said how I do it and why. We've said how Super Mario Bros. works. Decide if you like either, or come up with something that suits your own game's needs better. You should be making design decisions based on what YOU need. If Super Mario Bros. didn't need to display so much text, it could have used sprites to display its information. This would mean the top of the screen wouldn't need to be scroll locked, and it could use 16x15 screens. They made their decisions based on exactly what they wanted and needed, and you must do the same.
