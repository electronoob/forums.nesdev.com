<br /> Well... now you found somebody <img src="./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" />  I can see the attraction of wanting to making something that's highly compatible across the board. There are quite a bit of fami-clones out there (not to mention emulation itself).

When you see games like Gauntlet or Rad Racer II on the incompatibility list, that is why.  At least the Yobo, NEX, FC Twin, GN Twin, and Gen-X are all wired that way.

<br />
<br />A side question: Has anyone considered just shoving 4 screens to the nametable and then just using those to as the "screen" and scroll around on that, and when exiting, scroll onto 4 new nametables? I think that'd be great for an adventure game/RPG. Scrolls and has difference screens, I think both would be awesome.

<br />Sounds to me like a very cheap and limited way to do scrolling. Four-screen just makes programming easier, it doesn't make games any better. Pretty much everything that can be done with it can be done without it, even if a bit of extra work is required.

<br />
<br />Well, you could make it scroll from there too if you wanted, but I though just the mechanic of scrolling, but not having it go many screens, and keep them smaller like 2x2, and then do a zelda 1 type of scrolling when you hit the edge of the screen. Just wondering if that'd be cool or annoying. I'm trying to think of games for SNES that do something like that, but I can't think of any. Gauntlet does that, shove all 4 screens up and forgets it, but it was to keep track of the game that way and enemies.

I don't see much reasons for NOT using it (assuming you don't care about it) but I don't see much reasons for using it either... It's really down to if you want to pay the extra $3 per cart or have a harder time programming the scrolling engine.<br />You could even start with 4-screen programming and go back to a standard configuration right before releasing the game if you want to save the $3 per cart. If your scroll engine was well written the effort for doing this would be minimal.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">Sounds to me like a very cheap and limited way to do scrolling.

<br />Well, pretty much everything is not everything. I guess it could be good for fake 3D or really crazy raster demo-scene things.

<br />
<br />Well when you need to put about 8+ 2x2 tile enemies on the screen, the flicker without using it would be insane, and they couldn't remember them all on the screen I guess, so it seems they just suck it to the screen since everything else would just not be plausible and they did away with sprites flickering. The no scrolling sucks, but I think that's the right choice to get the game done.
