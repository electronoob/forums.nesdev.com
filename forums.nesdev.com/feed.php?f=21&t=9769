Yes, you can modify a game's palettes. However, depending on the game and how those colors are determined it may be as simple as a single value change and as complicated as the disassembly and reassembly of some code that generates palette choices. <br /><br />It is possible that the &quot;correct colors&quot; you want may not be available on the PC10 PPU, though you may find suitable replacements.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=5314">mikejmoffitt</a> — Wed Oct 16, 2013 10:41 am</p><hr />

I'm sorry, this might be the wrong place to ask this question, but I was wondering if anyone knew of a way to patch NES games to correct the colors for RGB modded systems.  My personal opinion is that 90% of the time the colors look fine; Some may be different, but to my eyes look fine.  The game that really bugs me is Zelda:  The dirt in the background looks terrible to me.  Also, Mario 1 and 3 look weird...it's not terrible, but it would be nice to set it back the way it was.<br /><br />It would be cool if these patches already existed, but if not where's a good place for me to start looking?  Thanks for your help.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=6182">robneal81</a> — Mon Sep 23, 2013 6:32 am</p><hr />

Sometimes games disable sprites in the area where the status bar is, which requires a $2001 write. But even if there's no apparent reason, a lot of games reconfigure the PPU every frame (i.e. they write to $2005, $2000 and $2001), maybe out of fear that using $2006/$2007 might screw things up (like is the case with scrolling), or maybe simply because their NMI handler is able to reconfigure the PPU every frame (i.e. it dumps values from RAM into the PPU registers, so that the program can just modify these variables if it wants to modify rendering parameters for the next frame).<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=95">tokumaru</a> — Tue Jun 25, 2013 7:00 am</p><hr />

After using spikeman romhacking + game genie codes I got to the spot in cossack stage 3 with color emphasis.  I sent spikeman the savestate, he found the data, and it's changed.  I wound up changing the rising / falling water from emphasis to grayscale.  In the brightman stage the areas that you can't see are also changed from emphasis to grayscale.  I burned the rom, plugged it into my mmc5 devcart, runs great on my rgb twin.  I think this is done unless we find another part of the game that uses color emphasis.  The author of this romhack only mentioned these two stages.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=4533">Drakon</a> — Mon Jun 24, 2013 8:45 am</p><hr />

According to the original author of this hack dr cossack stage 3 lower route also has color emphasis which it does in a playthrough video I found.
