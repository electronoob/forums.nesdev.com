How about just data with attributes for movement patterns, hits needed to kill, etc..?  I'm sure Dezaemon must do something similar.

I.e. it is similar in design and gameplay, reuses the same graphics, but has many differences, like less levels, different level maps, etc. Kid Icarus has the maze levels that aren't present in NES version.

I don't think there's any way to escape the need to manually write the code for both platforms.<br /><br />Keep in mind, the NES/GB were in a time before code portability was a concern for most people. (Hell, even now, trying to set up a cross-compiler is still excessively complicated. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" />)

A game comes out for Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 but not PC, even though PC supports a lot of the same DirectX APIs as Xbox 360.</div><br /><br />That's the publisher's call. A lot of publishers are relatively uninterested in PC releases because of the perceived piracy risk.<br /><br />If the publisher is only interested in console release, and does not contract a PC port with the developer, the developer might create a PC version for their own internal needs anyway. However, because they aren't being paid for it, they never put in the work to make it publish-ready, and would never deliver it to the publisher for release.<br /><br />If the console release is successful, the publisher may decide to have a delayed PC release once console sales of the title have dropped off (supposedly mitigating the impact of PC piracy on console sales). I think this scenario might be the most common one for multiplatform titles.<br /><br />There are of course platform exclusivity deals made here and there, too, but if something came out on 360 and PS3 obviously that wasn't the case. This is kind of outside the scope of multiplatform development discussion.<br /><br />Also, sometimes a multiplatform release gets aborted before all platforms are finished. A game I worked on had a PC and 360 release, but no PS3 release, even though we developed for all three platforms. The publisher cared most about the 360 release and it passed official testing first. The PC version wasn't subject to official scrutiny so it got very quickly wrapped up and released. The PS3 version just had to pass official testing but it never got submitted; the publisher decided to wait and see how the 360 sales went before they bothered, and apparently they were so disappointed with that they just dropped it altogether, even though the game was all but ready to ship on PS3.<br /><br />At any rate, I have yet to be involved in any professional game development that didn't have a working PC version for at least internal use. This statement applies to TV consoles as well as handhelds and cell phones. (I'm sure there are developers/projects out there who don't do this but I haven't worked with them yet, and I think they're in the minority.)

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I was hoping to be able to program a game for both consoles simultaneously (i.e. not just port it) with the platform-specific stuff of course written separately, but where the game logic is exactly the same, so that you really have one and the same game for NES and Game Boy and every change to the contents is reflected in both. But it seems like the Game Boy is really too different from the NES to implement this.
