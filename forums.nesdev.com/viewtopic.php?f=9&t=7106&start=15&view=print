<br />
<br />good to know for if/when I dump mine.
<br />
<br />OK, I had another thought about this cart.  is it possible that they are using a single enable ROM and the edge detector is so they don't need to use the CHR /CE line?
<br />
<br />is it possible they are only using /RD to enable the ROM?  I think on fighting hero they are using two  single enable CHR ROMs though... so maybe that's not it.  It sure is odd.  
<br />
<br />The other option is the CHR ROM was too slow or too fast and that was their hack to get it fixed.  one of those "oh hell, those 10000000 ROMs we ordered don't work!  what do we do?" type of things.
<br />
<br />One clue the ROM isn't fully happy is you said it gets quite a bit hotter than the other chips.  maybe this is due to some lingering bus conflicts?
<br />
<br />---
<br />
<br />A followup... I think I figured it out.   Looking over the previous stuff in the thread, I suspect that the CHR ROM miight have a positive enable on it.  why they didn't just invert /CE to it though I dunno.  But it's a possibility.  The disablement at the end of /RD would theoretically be to allow for the ALE event to latch the address from D to A0-7 and/or to read the nametables

<br />Mmm, I thought it had to be registered or something, my fault.

<br />
<br />- Since it mentions "CCE", it sold lots of such 60-pin black cartridges in Brazil (199X), by altering or erasing the original developer. Example: "Rock Man 2" had the CAPCOM words replaced by NTDEC. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" />

<br />
<br />Well my thought was they were using CHR /RD for the enable, but I'm leaning toward your theory that something is up with the access speed of the ROM. It's looking grim that I'll be able to read this via copynes so I yanked the ROM and read it directly (matches Gluk), also /CE must be normal, because I didn't have to jump it to VCC to read it. Only had to mess with A16 being non-standard.
<br />
<br />I hate to throw in the towel before fully understanding what's going on, but the game is dumped now and I've spent enough time on this as it is. Besides that, the title and demo music are starting to wear on me <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />
<br />
<br />I do appreciate the help, and if have any last minute ideas before it goes back in the mail, I can test them out.
<br />
<br />As for releasing the ROM, it's not my cart so Ill let the owner handle that as usual, but AFAIK it will be released. 
<br />
<br />About NTDEC, yeah, I think they were a pretty shady company from what I've seen. I wouldn't be too worried about them lobbing a copyright infringement suite at you. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" />
<br />
<br />Profile will be in the DB shortly, need to scan some things first.
