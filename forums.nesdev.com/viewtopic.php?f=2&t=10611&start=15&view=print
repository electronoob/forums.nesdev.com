It's not like homebrew has been based entirely on those documents that only leaked 30 years after their original intent (longer than the expiration time of a patent).<br /><br />But yes those names are terrible, just like the ones that tepples made which are IMO pretty bad but still better than Rico's.<br />I'd still vote for adding them in addition to the register name and the names tepples made. That was, all the info is here, and anyone is free to use them as they want.<br /><br />Someone with knownledge of japanese should definitely upload the &quot;optional header&quot; page with all the info from those documents. It's very interesting stuff I think.

Back when I was active on gbadev.org, I seem to remember there being a big no-no against even mentioning leaked official docs. Perhaps the difference is that I was writing homebrew for GBA while the system was still manufactured.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">30 years after their original intent (longer than the expiration time of a patent).</div><br />Copyrights on the documents in question last longer than patents. Look at some of koitsu's recent locks of topics in SNESdev when That One Manual gets brought up.

I don't want newbies to think they absolutely must use one type of name table mirroring/arrangement to scroll in a specific way, I want them to know that there are other things to consider.<br /><br />I think it's OK to document Nintendo's wording for preservation reasons, but I don't think it should be used in new documents or Wiki pages if it may give people the wrong idea.

No mention of test registers either. I wonder if the early CPU versions that don't have periodic noise also lack the test registers.
