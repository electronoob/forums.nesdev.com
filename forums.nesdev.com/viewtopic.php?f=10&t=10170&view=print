		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Hello skilled hackers! I need a tiny bit of assistance. <br /><br />Recently I discovered the outstanding Rockman 4 Minus Infinity hack, easily the most impressive NES hack of all time. The least build even adds a language option to convert the entire script to English. Unfortunately, almost every line is broken Engrish. Of course, I realize that the skilled hacker is Japanese and English is very different than Japanese in many ways. <br /><br />the patch can be found here: (apply to Rockman 4, not Megaman 4)<br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.romhacking.net/hacks/910/">http://www.romhacking.net/hacks/910/</a><!-- m --><br /><br />If needed, pm me and I'll email you the prepatched 1MB rom. <br /><br />Although the hack is simply amazing, it is filled with Engrish. In this capacity, I'd like to help. <br /><br />With only some minor changes, the english could be so much better, and still stay within the character limits.<br /><br />Although I have no rom hacking skills myself, I'd like to fix the grammar mistakes through visual mockups of every string of English text in the game. <br /><br />Here's what I've finished thus far. Left is the original Engrish, right are my edits. <br /><br /><img src="http://24.media.tumblr.com/c3c23b0742d0d8b9d09a289e3852cf0b/tumblr_moeg2klMwF1rc7qlzo1_1280.png" alt="Image" /><br /><img src="http://25.media.tumblr.com/e6cdfef79abb27a471035aca3765ba09/tumblr_moeg2klMwF1rc7qlzo2_1280.png" alt="Image" /><br /><img src="http://25.media.tumblr.com/5ad6b7786d4415f79fee7a7bb4ea85ad/tumblr_moeg2klMwF1rc7qlzo3_1280.png" alt="Image" /><br /><br />The exact wording of the text isn't finalized by any means. Right now, this is all just a proof of concept. <br /><br />If there are any skilled rom hackers reading this, it would GREATLY help if someone could take a look at the newest version of the hack in a disassembler or such and could produce for me some sort of image file to tell me exactly what English characters the game can produce. <br /><br />Is it as limited as the Megaman 2 font? This is Megaman 2's font: <br /><br /><img src="http://24.media.tumblr.com/9f2446d8328c4ca5cbc15b8cc47e3fff/tumblr_moes7rsE511rc7qlzo1_250.png" alt="Image" /><br /><br />Or is it expanded like the Rockman/Mega Man 9 and 10 font? <br /><br />Mega Man 9 font: <br /><br /><img src="http://www.sprites-inc.co.uk/files/Classic/MM9/Misc/Screen/mm9_font.png" alt="Image" /><br /><br />If it's as limited as the Rockman 2 font, could anyone possibly add in additional characters? If just the lowercase a-z letters were added, it would add greatly. Typing all in caps, even in an 8-bit game, feels like everyone's always shouting. I guess that works for the time period, but I think it would be better overall if I could add lower case characters. <br /><br />Thanks!

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Usually, I'd find it unlikely that lowercase letters would be available. Since there are only 256 tiles for the whole background (unless there's mid-screen bankswitching involved), there's very little reason to waste 26 of them on letters that are already available in uppercase form... But since this game can switch between Japanese and English, and Japanese needs more characters, there might be some free space for the extra English characters.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />To further expand on tokumaru's point, here's a screenshot of the font I tend to use when doing development.  It consists of both English (uppercase only) and Japanese (hiragana and katakana), along with all the &quot;preferred&quot; Japanese symbols and diacritics (tenten and maru) plus some others (arrows, etc.).  It's a combination of fonts from two commercial games (Wizardry: The Knight of Diamonds and Megami Tensei 2) with some adjustments.<br /><br />This should give you some idea how little pattern table space you have left over for actual game graphics.  Specifically: you're left with 77 tiles free in pattern table #0, and 256 in pattern table #1.<br /><br />If you want the font itself (i.e. .CHR file), let me know -- it's not like I designed/drew the tiles.<br /><br />I also included a screenshot to give you some idea of what it looks like visually when used.<br /><br />Using compression of any kind doesn't help -- this is is a shot of what ends up in PPU RAM, i.e. the memory used to represent a tile on-screen.  Compression would only help decrease used ROM size/space.<br /><br />Other solutions:<br /><br />a) Release multiple romhacks of the game, one for each language (I wouldn't bother trying Chinese),<br /><br />b) Offer a single ROM and allow the player to choose which language they want -- but if they pick Japanese the language still ends up taking roughly half an entire pattern table, which means some languages might offer &quot;more graphics&quot; than others (this would be considered a very extensive/very complex romhack, FYI -- and whoever is doing your programming/assembly will hate you),<br /><br />c) Use a mapper that uses CHR-ROM (not CHR-RAM), then swap in/out the CHR-ROM page between scanlines.  There are commercial games which do this; it requires accurate/precise timing and some way (in the text engine) of inducing that swap in/out (you won't have enough time during HBlank to do this with CHR-RAM),<br /><br />d) Consider MMC5, which offers expansion RAM for the PPU (specifically, each tile has its own 4KByte CHR-ROM page associated with it, as well as its own individual palette -- I'm referring to background tiles, not sprites, by the way),<br /><br />e) Scrap the idea of lowercase letters -- this has my vote, just FYI.  Stick with the original style that the game offered.  Nothing pisses me off more than when I try a translation romhack where the author(s) decided they'd replace the font and entire text with a bunch of crap that looks awful.  Stay true to the roots of the game at all costs.<br /><br />P.S. -- Some English/translation clean-up:<br /><br /><ul><li>&quot;soler&quot; should be &quot;solar&quot;; Japanese (sometimes even today) often have no idea how to spell the word they're looking to use in English.  Surely you've seen &quot;CONGRATURATIONS!&quot; more than once.  Also, I highly recommend you change that first paragraph into this: &quot;Rockman's main weapon, powered by solar energy; infinite ammunition.&quot;.  You could use the word &quot;light&quot; instead of &quot;solar energy&quot;, but people like Tepples would throw a fit.  Same goes for &quot;ammo&quot; instead of &quot;ammunition&quot;.</li><li>&quot;Electrically charged&quot; is a hyphenated word.</li><li>&quot;Lightbulbs&quot; is two words; use the term &quot;light bulb&quot; once, then subsequently use the term &quot;bulb&quot;.</li><li>&quot;... to the barrel&quot; should be &quot;... into the barrel&quot;.</li><li>&quot;Press Up and B&quot; should read &quot;Hold Up and B&quot;.</li><li>I haven't played the game, but &quot;wave&quot; might actually be better translated as &quot;field&quot; given the context.  In the same sentence, you might also change the word &quot;that&quot; into &quot;which&quot;.</li></ul>

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />That's very interesting information koitsu. Since you obviously have the technical knowledge I'm seeking, I would like very much if you could take a look at the Rockman 4 Minus Infinity hack and tell me what's it's situation with it's font is. The game offers a language selection on the titlescreen for Japanese or English so it's text data must be similar to your wizardry + megami tensei font. <br /><br />Although I'm not not a romhacker, I've played hundreds of romhacks for the NES/Famicom and again quite readily willing to say that <strong>Rockman 4 MI is easily the most advanced, complicated and impressive Famicom romhack in existence.</strong> <br /><br />Although originally based on Rockman 4 (TGROM, MMC3-B (mapper 4) with a 512K combined PRG/CHR, 8K CHR-RAM and a password progress save system) this hack throws that all out the window with a mapper change and general overhaul to MMC5 (specifically, ETROM MMC5 (mapper 5) with 1 MB combined PRG/CHR, 8K Main Work RAM, and 8K Battery-based Work RAM. And yes, the hack USES the MMC5 to create effects you'd normally expect from 16 bit games. Even Gimmick isn't as impressive!) <br /><br />Given all that it is, I would please ask you to take a detailed look at it's character bank to tell me first of all what characters are available, and the feasibility of adding the English lowercase characters to it.<br /><br />I don't want the font changed, I want the font expanded. <br /><br />Again take a look at the Rockman 9 Wiiware font. This is the SAME font as the one created for Rockman 2, 3 ,4, 5 and 6 but expanded with more characters. <br /><br />If they're not there, the only ones that would need to be added are the lower case English letters. <br /><img src="http://www.sprites-inc.co.uk/files/Classic/MM9/Misc/Screen/mm9_font.png" alt="Image" /><br /><br />Thank you!<br /><br />Hmmm there doesn't seem to be a pm system on nesdev, or else I'd just email you the rom. I'll breifly host the rom until you can get it.<br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.mediafire.com/download/afy22id5e2kab23/rockman4_mi_MMC5_patched_satoshi.zip">http://www.mediafire.com/download/afy22 ... atoshi.zip</a><!-- m --><br />PASSWORD: famicom

Now, this is effectively hacking a hack (well, it already was when you decided to change the text), so it requires some reverse engineering of the routines that write the characters to CHR-RAM.
