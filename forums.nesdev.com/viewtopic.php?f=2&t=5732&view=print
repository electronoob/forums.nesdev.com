<br />
<br />I thought of quite a neat idea for the "play head" in my tracker and did a quick bit of rough timing code to prove it looks good. My idea was to have a 8 pixel high raster effect that changes the emphasis bits. The position of the raster bar would be the current step of the sequence.
<br />
<br />The problem is, once I have other stuff in my NMI (DMA routine for screen refreshing etc.) the timing is not as predictable and therefore not as easy to push the raster bar down the screen using loop delays.
<br />
<br />Any clever ideas?

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />A sprite 0 hit would probably work best for timing a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raster_bar" class="postlink">raster bar</a>. You can put it at any position, as long as you draw opaque pixels of sprite 0 in front of or behind opaque pixels of the background. Wait for a sprite 0 hit, overwrite the PPU tint bits, wait a few more hundred cycles, and change them back. One thing you do have to watch when doing sprite 0 is how much processing you do above and below sprite 0: you should finish processing before sprite 0 hit happens, and then you should finish processing before vertical blanking happens. If the Y position of sprite 0 will vary considerably, you'll need to schedule various subroutines to be called above or below the split depending on the position and how long they usually take.

<br />what do you mean exactly by introducing gameboy features.
<br />What exactly ? <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /> (my megaman 3 rom hack uses the mmc5 mapper) well i was just curious what you meant about gameboy specific things.

<br />In a typical tracker the raster bar effect is stationary in the middle of the screen and the sequences glide upward as the song is playing.  Perhaps make the raster bar stationary [use MMC3 IRQ, sprite 0, whatever] and use $2005/$2006 writes to scroll the sequences?

<br />For one thing, reading every English doc on the front page and then writing some test case programs. Since the wiki was started, I've been incorporating new findings (such as the double clock glitch when reading the controller and playing samples) into the wiki, and that means reading pretty much every page that anyone put on the wiki.
<br />
<br />A problem with MMC3 is the lack of a 72-pin counterpart to <a href="http://wiki.nesdev.com/w/index.php/TNROM" class="postlink">HVC-TNROM</a>, the only MMC3 board with CHR RAM and PRG RAM. So if your program's on-screen text is primarily in any language other than Japanese, you have to choose between CHR ROM and PRG RAM or CHR RAM and no PRG RAM. That, along with the availability of SNROM-clone boards (with MMC1 mapper) from RetroZone, is a reason that I haven't tried to find clever MMC3 tricks lately.
