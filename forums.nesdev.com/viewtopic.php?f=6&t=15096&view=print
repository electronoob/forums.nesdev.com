This means only 25 semitones (two octaves) are reachable at once, but there's also a command to shift this 25-note range up or down arbitrarily during a pattern. I know it'd cost a byte of RAM per track to store the range's base, but I'd bet it could save bytes of ROM all over the place. Worth a try?

I have it so that the note will end as soon as it (pitch slide down) overflows past x7 ff. That seemed logical to me, and consistent with the 1xx effect. But, I noticed that famitracker instead holds the note at x7 ff, instead of ending the note.<br /><br />Are there any musicians here who will be annoyed at inconsistency with famitracker?

What's the advantage of making it do something the user wouldn't expect?<br /><br />It's one thing to do so if it's for the sake of a more convenient implementation, but simply imposing your own &quot;logic&quot; about how the feature should work doesn't seem productive to me.

(He releases NSFs publicly, but everything is done in Famitracker, so he certainly has the .ftm files laying around).  <a href="http://famitracker.com/music/enl_track1.ftm" class="postlink">enl_track1.ftm</a> also uses 3xx and 4xx (see pattern 0x0c).<br /><br />Edit: I also noticed that the classical_9b.ftm (a strange remix of Pachelbel's Canon in D) uses 4xx, so I've attached that.

I'm not sure if 4xx or Vxx is the most popular Famitracker effect. You can probably find it in <em>most</em> FTMs.<br /><br />1xx and 2xx are a lot less common, because there are more practical alternatives, usually: the targeted slides like 3xx, Qxx, Rxx let you slide to a specific pitch easily, and the hardware slides Ixx, Hxx have the advantage of being logarithmic and they don't pop at power-of-two crossings. It's also very easy to replicate 1xx and 2xx as envelopes, if the feature is unavailable for some reason.<br /><br />Ixx/Hxx aren't terribly practical for games, but Qxx/Rxx/3xx are all basically just 1xx/2xx with a stopping point, and can be implemented as an extension of them.<br /><br />Trying to find in my music something that uses the three effects you asked, this one uses 4xx constantly, 2xx a little, and 1xx once: <a href="http://rainwarrior.ca/music/TotalTeeGolf.ftm" class="postlink">http://rainwarrior.ca/music/TotalTeeGolf.ftm</a><br />It uses most other effects too, though (excluding DPCM), so unless you implemented everything it might not be a good demo.<br /><br />Finding pre-existing music that's restricted to just some particular subset of effects and is also a good demonstration might be difficult. I could host a compo at <a href="http://battleofthebits.org/" class="postlink">battle of the bits</a> asking for something specific like that if you wanted.

There's no problems if you process them one at a time, but that is a huge pain.<br /><br />I'm not sure how to fix this.<br /><br />text2data does a bunch of things that make this extra difficult. It removes unused envelopes, and reorganizes them. It saves space by using references to other data.<br /><br />The problem seems to be, my text2vol is inserting junk data into songs. It seems to be bits and pieces of other songs, like old data left in a buffer.<br /><br />Any way. Don't use this on multiple songs, until I come up with a solution. Sorry.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I've made a few attempts to debug the problem of garbage data being (sometimes) emitted if multiple songs are processed. I'm not having a lot of luck.<br /><br />One of my problems is, it's hard to set a breakpoint for a large array, where any point in the array could be the problem... and the program keeps making a new array and renaming, and modifying the length of each chunk...so I can't wrap my head around which point of which song I'm at at any given break.<br /><br />I'm pretty sure it's parsing the text correctly, but by the time it's sent to song_split pattern length and row position is kind of a mystery.<br /><br />I suspect the problem is unusual or inconsistent pattern lengths (like song0 has 128 rows per pattern, but song1 has 70 rows per pattern). And the text2data is sort of expecting it to be a power of 2. Maybe.<br /><br />Any help from someone more experienced debugging C++ would be appreciated.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Hello !<br />I'm also working with Famitone and i add some feature you found with the volume and the &quot;every-note support&quot;.<br />I see some problem too.<br />With the <strong><span style="color: #FFFFFF">pitch envelope</span></strong> :<br />It's work completely different with Famitracker : the pitch is added in every loop for example :<br />pitch : 0 1 2 3 | 4 (&quot;|&quot; is the loop position)<br />the period offset will be : +0 +1 +3 +6 +10 +14 +18 .... in Famitracker<br />So i add a new variable in every channel who use the pitch and cumulate the value and the music's composer have to be careful to didn't go out of the frequency's bounds. In the case there is no loop, the converter have to add a zero value at the end of the envelope.<br /><br />I remake a converter in Java because yours didn't work on Linux (with Wine too, you used a C library specific to Window$, i didn't have the problem with Famitone 2 version) but i have some bug to correct and the change i made to Famitone make the values completely different. But i see an error with the <strong><span style="color: #FFFFFF">loop position</span></strong> when it's in a repeated value sequence like :<br />0 0 1 1 1 | 1 1 1 2 2 2<br />the Famitone loop send to the first value &quot;1&quot; because it's keep the sequence as a block (0*2,1*6,2*3). In fact the repeated value must to be split in two (0*2,1*3,1*3,2*3) and the loop need to go to the second repeat sequence to be correct. <br /><br />I also make a <strong><span style="color: #FFFFFF">PAL note's table</span></strong> (because i'm a frog eater ! <img src="./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" /> ):<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">_FT2NoteTableLSB:<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;.byte $ff,$ff<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;;note&nbsp; C-&nbsp; C#&nbsp; D-&nbsp; D#&nbsp; E-&nbsp; F-&nbsp; F#&nbsp; G-&nbsp; G#&nbsp; A-&nbsp; A#&nbsp; B- &nbsp; &nbsp;octave<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;.byte $ff,$ff,$ff,$ff,$ff,$ff,$ff,$ff,$d1,$60,$f6,$92&nbsp; &nbsp;;0<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;.byte $34,$db,$86,$37,$ec,$a5,$62,$23,$e8,$b0,$7b,$49&nbsp; &nbsp;;1<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;.byte $19,$ed,$c3,$9b,$75,$52,$31,$11,$f3,$d7,$bd,$a4&nbsp; &nbsp;;2<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;.byte $8c,$76,$61,$4d,$3a,$29,$18,$08,$f9,$eb,$de,$d1&nbsp; &nbsp;;3<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;.byte $c6,$ba,$b0,$a6,$9d,$94,$8b,$84,$7c,$75,$6e,$68&nbsp; &nbsp;;4<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;.byte $62,$5d,$57,$52,$4e,$49,$45,$41,$3e,$3a,$37,$34&nbsp; &nbsp;;5<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;.byte $31,$2e,$2b,$29,$26,$24,$22,$20,$1e,$1d,$1b,$19&nbsp; &nbsp;;6<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;.byte $18,$16,$15,$14,$13,$12,$11,$10,$0f,$0e,$0d,$0c&nbsp; &nbsp;;7<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />_FT2NoteTableMSB:<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;.byte $07,$07<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;;note&nbsp; C-&nbsp; C#&nbsp; D-&nbsp; D#&nbsp; E-&nbsp; F-&nbsp; F#&nbsp; G-&nbsp; G#&nbsp; A-&nbsp; A#&nbsp; B- &nbsp; &nbsp;octave<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;.byte $07,$07,$07,$07,$07,$07,$07,$07,$07,$07,$06,$06&nbsp; &nbsp;;0<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;.byte $06,$05,$05,$05,$04,$04,$04,$04,$03,$03,$03,$03&nbsp; &nbsp;;1<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;.byte $03,$02,$02,$02,$02,$02,$02,$02,$01,$01,$01,$01&nbsp; &nbsp;;2<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;.byte $01,$01,$01,$01,$01,$01,$01,$01,$00,$00,$00,$00&nbsp; &nbsp;;3<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;.byte $00,$00,$00,$00,$00,$00,$00,$00,$00,$00,$00,$00&nbsp; &nbsp;;4<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;.byte $00,$00,$00,$00,$00,$00,$00,$00,$00,$00,$00,$00&nbsp; &nbsp;;5<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;.byte $00,$00,$00,$00,$00,$00,$00,$00,$00,$00,$00,$00&nbsp; &nbsp;;6<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;.byte $00,$00,$00,$00,$00,$00,$00,$00,$00,$00,$00,$00&nbsp; &nbsp;;7<br /></div><br /><br />My friend who make the music is very sad to can't add Duty envelope so i add it and remove duty-strange-thing.
