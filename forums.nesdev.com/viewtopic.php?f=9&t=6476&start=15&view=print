<br />@MottZilla are you sure it's not just a timing issue as LCD Screens have a latency which CRT hasn't?

<br />If by NEWS you mean NES, then there are games that do rely on the top-to-bottom scanning of a CRT so that they can only iterate among the targets close to the scanline where the player shot. It's fairly easy to determine the time between sprite 0 and sensing light, even if the NES isn't fast enough to count how far from the left the shot was. One game relying on this is <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIJ5fCyQkeE" class="postlink">Operation Wolf</a>.

<br />Isn't there also a delay introduced by the LCD TV? Don't they spend some time filtering analog signals, meaning that when the white is finally displayed the NES game isn't even looking for it anymore?

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I don't think the latency or non-scanning even comes into play as the LCD doesn't emit light to the Lens of the gun. They would be the next issues to worry about. But the NES Zapper is very primative as I've heard. Something about only detecting not enough light, and enough light, combining with white hit boxes and black screen to figure it out. 
<br />
<br />On SNES and I think Genesis there are HV latches to help figure out shot location. On PS1/PS2 Guncon they even bring in the Composite Video signal to help figure out shot location. But these all rely on the scanning raster type update of a CRT at 15khz.
<br />
<br />I'm not expert on the details, but I can tell you as someone that enjoys lightgun games that they are all designed to work on a 15khz CRT. If they don't use a CRT, they aren't relying on the Light from the display for aiming and are using another mech for it. Like the Wii and Infrared.

<br />That and optionally detecting the time in scanlines from when the PPU started sending the frame to when the light is in range, which acts like the V half of an HV latch.
<br />
<br />Wii uses an 0.01 Mpx pixel camera in the remote that reads the positions of up to four IR emitters. (The Sensor Bar contains two banks of IR LEDs.) I wonder why Virtual Console doesn't emulate a Zapper with this information.
