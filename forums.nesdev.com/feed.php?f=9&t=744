If someone was to go to all this effort, they should include CopyNES support, Save states, movie file playback, NSF player all via USB..<br /><br />Would be nice if it could be done without hurting compatiblility.<p>Statistics: Posted by Guest — Mon Nov 14, 2005 7:56 am</p><hr />

Forgot to mention... the tools for designing and even simulating FPGA's are completely free from either Xilinx or Altera, so anyone could help even without investing in a dev board.  It would be a great way to get started if you have an interest in digital design.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=29">teaguecl</a> — Fri Nov 11, 2005 9:24 pm</p><hr />

There seems to be a lot of interest in this, and a growing amount of hardware interest in this community.  I think it might be time to start a open source project to re-implement some of the NES's parts.  I would propose doing separate VHDL implementations of the APU, CPU and PPU on the NES, as well as some MMC chips.  It wouldn't be too hard to wire a CPLD or FPGA into a toaster or cart to try each of these out individually.  Once this foundation started to work, people could start putting them together into stand alone systems.  <br />Kevin's FPGA NES doesn't make any sense to manufacture at this point in time - and neither would a system based on community designs.   However, the work can be done and tested now - and maybe by the time it's done there will be a more viable option to manufacture.  It will be fun and educational regardless of whether it ever turns into a product.  Plus, we can always test it out on demo boards like the one at Microsprite <a href="http://www.microsprite.com/documentation" class="postlink">http://www.microsprite.com/documentation</a><br />This idea gives us nice options... like adding s-video out to the PPU.  Sure, it won't be any better quality, but at least your more modern cables will fit in it.<br />If anyone would like to pursue this, please register your interest.  I've got a start on a MMC1 implementation to kick things off - it's pretty rough right now but you have to start somewhere <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" />  I also know a bit about microprocessor design, so I don't think re-implementing a 6502 will be that tough.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=29">teaguecl</a> — Fri Nov 11, 2005 9:18 pm</p><hr />

Already ahead of you, except I'm working on a single board Famicom designed to fit back into a old model Famicom, no more 74 series (now a small CPLD, so it has a little propriety), 2k/8k selectable WRAM, thinking about a NTSC/PAL switchable design using a PAL encoder (PAL video with real 60hz gameplay ;) I have a cool Hong Kong Famicom that can do this but since I don't live in a PAL country, I dunno if I should bother. I thought it would be cool to use the CPLD to additionally put in a HW debugger, that's way too ambitious for me however<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=20">kyuusaku</a> — Fri Nov 11, 2005 12:23 pm</p><hr />

Someone should really design a better NES.  I see two possibilities.  First, you design an almost-replacement system, differing in design.  It would probably look something like a top-loader.  Inside it would have a motherboard almost fully populated.  The electrical components would be in place, as would be the LSI chips (139, 373, 368, 2x2K S-RAM), the 2 port NES controller brick, the 72-pin connector (designed for NES carts) and the Nintendo AV multi-out + AC adapter connectors.  It would also have two 40 pin sockets for a 2A03 and a 2C02.  The idea is that you find the chips and put them in the socket yourself and you can play the NES.  The best place to find such chips would be from front-loaders, which would be desoldered therefrom for an additional fee.  Alternatively, the system could support a 2C03 RGB PPU chip.  This would have to do unless someone wanted to fully reverse engineer these chips and make clones.<br /><br />My other idea revolves around replacing the top half of the NES.  This top half should have a lower profile than the original and will have a slot in the middle for the cartridge connector.  The cartridge connector will be supported by a brace and will have a ribbon cable with a female edge connector fit onto the male edge connector on the PCB.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=58">Great Hierophant</a> — Fri Nov 11, 2005 12:10 pm</p><hr />
