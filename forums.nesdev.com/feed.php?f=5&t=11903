The problem with infrarred is that... it was just flawed, period. First of all the two gameboys had to be perfectly aligned, so that rules out multiplayer. Also there wasn't any proper protocol for it, the game had to bitbang the data through the port, meaning it was up to the game to define the protocol (also why it was so slow to use). Ouch. I think the only time it ever saw any serious use was with Pokémon, since trading is a crucial part of it and not everybody had a cable to connect both gameboys.<br /><br />A more serious compatibility issue probably came from the GBA: you could technically connect a GBA to a GB/GBC through a link cable... except it only worked for GB/GBC games. In GBA mode it used a faster clock speed, without any option to use the slower clock speed (which was only available in GB/GBC mode). This effectively made it impossible to transfer Pokémons from Gen I and II to Gen III (which probably wasn't a minor issue, given the games we're talking about). Good job Nintendo, all you had to do was to allow changing the clock speed and you screwed up that =|<br /><br />As for the New 3DS: I seriously think that the biggest problem with it is the name =P That makes it sound like it's just another 3DS revision, when it's actually a different system. If it was named something else nobody would have complained, it'd be just seen as the expected successor to the 3DS as usual.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=4526">Sik</a> — Mon Oct 13, 2014 11:43 am</p><hr />

Infrared communication was actually possible on the DMG with the HuC1. The difference was that Nintendo made it a standard feature of the hardware rather than a cartridge-based add-on, but developers definitely had the option prior to the GBC (though going Hudson's route would likely have been very expensive).<br /><br />The New 3DS is much more than what the GBC was to the DMG. The new physical inputs are expected to be used much more than something like the GBC's IR port (which was severly underutilized in all but a handful of game). Two new triggers and a new analog input alone are enough to create software incompatibilities depending on what the developers do. While the GBC's improved Z80-variant was faster (twice as fast) it didn't add any new usable instructions. Though I'm speculating, it's entirely possible that code for New 3DS game's might take advantage of NEON ARM instructions, in theory at least. That right there could also create software incompatibilities unlike the DMG to GBC transition. The bigger VRAM isn't as dramatic as the two other changes I mentioned, so that's not really unprecedented.<br /><br />Needless to say, Nintendo's never gone quite this far when making revisions to their portables within the same generation. Perhaps they feel some pressure to do so (faster hardware cadence?)<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=6368">Shonumi</a> — Mon Oct 13, 2014 6:49 am</p><hr />

<div class="quotetitle">ShaneM wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"><br />I recently saw earlier this year a commercial for the Zelda and Mario Wii U deluxe where there were kids in front of the TV...thinking of ways to get their parents to buy something. Whenever there is a new build or even a promotion, Nintendo takes advantage of the children because they know that's how they'll get the money. Parents don't know half the time what they're getting. I work in the electronics department at Meijer's and I can tell you some of the ridiculous things kids tell their parents about it.<br /></div><br /><br />Well, to raise another point, not every kid is the sharpest knife in the drawer, so I gather kids are going to say ridiculous things regardless of Nintendo's hand (I know I did...) A great many industries advertize to kids and for kids. If they can convince the kid on their product (fairly or unfairly), then they will. Nintendo isn't the only offender in this arena. It's probably something that can be tied to modern consumerism if anything. I mean, my friends and I were like that for just about everything game related. Any console that was new, it was on our &quot;gotta have it, need it&quot; list, and between the lot of us, at least one of my friends had one of every console when we were growing up, always from begging our parents. <br /><br />I guess we see less advertizing aimed at kids from Sony and MS simply because they don't really have the whole &quot;Family&quot; label that Nintendo dominates, unless you're the kind of family gets around the TV to play CoD, or Assassin's Creed, or the like. Nintendo's always been a kind of &quot;all ages&quot; console maker, bending towards younger players though. I suppose it's going to be inevitable that their marketing targets impressionable youths.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">ShaneM wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"><br />Nintendo is worse than PS/XBOX when it comes to being morally ethical.<br /></div><br /><br />From their perspective, they really don't need to. They're a business after all. As long as their PR remains good, and as long as their products sell, the considerations raised in this thread will likely continue to go on unaddressed. And apparently it takes a lot to flounder your PR with gamers, given all the things in the past few years that both Sony and MS have done themselves.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=6368">Shonumi</a> — Sun Oct 12, 2014 10:25 pm</p><hr />
