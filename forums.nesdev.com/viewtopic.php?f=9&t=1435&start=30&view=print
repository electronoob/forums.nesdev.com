<br />Okay, I really see now this was like the dumbest idea ever, because I have no idea what I'm talking about when it comes to pinouts. How would I figure such a thing out? I assumed that this was going to be okay, because I asked if I could just program the chip, and replace the PRG (which is still in good condition by the way, and I can solder it back in if I want) with the EPROM, and nobody said no, so I thought it'd be okay. Well, I didn't destroy anything, so it's all good.

<br />You will notice some difference on pins 1, 2, 24, 30 and 31.
<br />So you conclude the following modifications :
<br />
<br /><em>- Cut tracks to pins 1, 2, 24, 30 and 31. (that will be hard for 30 and 31 because they're tied to VCC, so bend up pins if necessary)<br />- Wire pin 30 to hole 1 (A17)<br />- Wire pin 31 to hole 2 (A18)<br />- Wire pin 24 to GND (/OE)<br />- Wire pin 2 to hole 24 (A16)<br />- Wire pin 1 to VCC (GND should also work, but do not leave it floating) (VPP)</em>
<br />
<br />It really isn't that complicated. I hope you will be able to do it even with the chip already soldered on the board, but it will make the task harder.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />It's a shame for your broken EPROM. Dissolvering a chip with more than 8 pins without damage is hard to impossible, at least for me.
<br />You basically have 2 methods for rewiring. Cut track, and place wires with the track that was leading to the pin, by scratching the track or sometimes you'll find a hole that change the side of the PCB for the track that will serve as a solder point if you're lucky.
<br />You can also bend pins up, and solder the wire in the hole, that is exactly the same. I prefer cut tracks, but if you prefer bend pins that really doesn't matter.
<br />Normally you don't have to wire to a hole where there is already a pin in, exept for VCC and GND, but then solder the wire on the pad next to the pin.
<br />To wire pin 1 to VCC, if you bend it up you'll have to place a wire across the chip, that's the easier way to do that. You could also found some other point that is connected to VCC or GND. On my datasheets, they say VPP can be either state. I don't know if it really matter if that pins is connected to something or not, but I'd not leave it floating just to be safe, espectially considering that all EPROMs are CMOS technology, and that leave floating is forbidden in CMOS technology chip whatever you happen to be doing, because you are getting parasited and you consumme useless power. LS technology chips don't matter if unused pins are leave floating.

<br />
<br />Also, when I wire stuff, I just use solder wire, because I can just melt the wire to where I want it soldered. Is that a bad idea for wiring?
<br />
<br />My 27C040, if it's the same brand, will have a notch on one end. That's the end with pin 1, right? There's this kind:

<br />Yes, it is a bad idea, unless you make sure that the solder won't make electical contact with anything else, wich is pretty hard on a PCB due to the number of solder pads there is on the board. You should found a trick to make sure that you get no short circuit whatever happen. I reccomand getting tiny isolated wire that will work better. I got from my dad some wire that is isolated by a strange tiny red stuff that melt when you solder, so the wire can make easily contact and still be isolated. I don't know hot to explain this in english, but it works good.
<br />
<br />PS: Pin 1 is always near the mark conter clock-wise.

One thing I don't like is when wires like that have such a tiny end, it is hard to solder. Like my 9V battery snap that I soldered to the end of my NES cord, the ends were so tiny, and it is not soldered on there very well. I guess I'm getting alot better at soldering. I successfully desoldered my CPU when trying to build my CopyNES, and I was told that was extremely difficult. It wasn't that hard for me. The pins were a little bent, but it made it out okay. I can still play on the system, but I've never successfully dumped a game on to my computer.
<br />
<br />I'm excited to continue on with this project! I hope it works, I really do.

<br />It's good if you're getting better at sldering. I really DO hate soldering. I'm unable to solver something with more than 8 pins without totally destroying it. I tried to disolver a CIC, but I totally failed, most pins were broken, and it was only 14 pins, I think. Disolvering pins isn't a problem at first, but when you removed solver on all pins, you notice that the chip still is fixed to the PCB and don't want to move. Then I have to figure wich pins are badly fixed and from here things get worse and worse to go to the catastrophe.
<br />I also hate soldering wires, because they're always moving. You need a hand to hold the iron and the other to hold the solder, so you need to trick to have your wire hold where you want it to be soldered, and this is quite hard, because you have to use the same hand that hold the soder and.... whatever, it is so horrible.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I know I've said this before on this forum but wire wrap wire is ideal for devcarts. It's just the right size, comes in spools of different colours and is reliable. It's really cheap. You buy a little tool like a small screwdriver which connects the wire to the pins and also removes the insulation. It's very cheap and available from almost any electronic shop like RadioShack. Also the cheap bulb desoldering iron from RadioShack ($12) makes taking out mask rom easy and safe. I can take a 32 pin mask out in around 5 minutes with no damage. I also found a used weller soldering station on eBay that was pretty cheap. I've used it for a few years now and it makes soldering a real pleasure. If you're going to do electronics for your whole life it makes sense to buy some good tools (used if you're on a budget).

It really depends. I'm not worried about destroying MASK ROMs though, since if the devcart works you can just program that same game and put those chips in. So you don't actually loose the game...
