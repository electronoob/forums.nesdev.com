The intended meaning may be clear to users of the forum, but necessarily to those with an outside perspective.<br /><br />More on topic, I think positive exposure to both something specific like NES development and more broad like an appreciation for computing is something that must be done early on. It is good that some high schools are willing to introduce students to programming, but at least from my experience the result is that people hate it or want to make money with it as mentioned earlier in the thread. Finding someone willing to teach at that level who can be passionate about why they enjoy it is certainly a challenge.

Yeah, I guess part of me is being a little sensitive to the matter too - in portraying NES homebrewing, I didn't want to come off as completely neglecting a demographic if that demographic did exist and I just had not met them yet.  I didn't necessarily want to make any sort of dramatic case for women in the community, but just wanted to make sure that if they were out there, they were proportionally represented.   Didn't mean for things to get all political.  haha.<br /><br />Just something I HAVE noted which might be interesting - I taught game development at the high school level for 6 years.  My classes averaged about 50-50 gender ratio, which I thought was awesome.  Every semester it was the same...the girls seemed bored (or pretended to hate it for appearances or whatever) while the boys were sort of ruthless in reminding them that game development was a boys club and only dudes understood what really made a good game.  By the end of the semester, EVERY semester for the 11 semesters that we invited outside developers to blindly critique and judge the games, girls took the top spots for best game.  Every single time.<br /><br />I thought that was actually really neat and inspiring.  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":-)" title="Smile" /></div><br />You lucky bastard... In order to take a programming class at my school, you have to take a class in 9th grade that teaches you how to use Microsoft Office, which about half of the class <em>still</em> doesn't know how to do, and a lot of the people are sophomores too. I learned how to use Microsoft Word when I was 6 years old at my old school in Virginia. It was really cool, because if you had any remaining time when you got done with the lesson, you got to play on Kid Pix. Anyone remember that? Anyway, I bet I'm not even going to like the programming class when I get there, because it's sure as hell not going to teach you ASM. (And not on the 65816. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=":wink:" title="Wink" /> ) it's probably going to be RubyPython+++++ or whatever bloated, inefficient garbage. That kind of reminds me, my father got me this Raspberry Pi thing to &quot;program&quot; on or whatever. I haven't even touched it. Should I?

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Hi there... female NESdever chiming in. I've been lurking on the boards since the early 2000s, and got my account here in 2006 or so, but I don't post much. I think a few folks here know me or have collaborated with me in some way, though. <br /><br />I'm the only woman I know of who has released NES homebrew. (Though I'd love to meet more!) <br /><br />I think there are a number of factors that turn girls away from homebrew culture before they can get deeply invested in it. For example, when I was younger, forums felt especially unwelcoming to girls, so I mostly taught myself 6502 out of old programming books. <br /><br />My latest NES release was in September (<!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://partytimehexcellent.itch.io/electronic-sweet-n-fun-fortune-teller">http://partytimehexcellent.itch.io/elec ... une-teller</a><!-- m -->), and I'm working on a new NES game now. I've been hacking various Nintendo platforms since I was about 17 or so. (My most recent hack was putting one of my NES homebrews inside of Animal Crossing for Gamecube: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkDweI9U4Jg">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkDweI9U4Jg</a><!-- m -->).<br /><br />My area of interest is in representing femininity and girls' cultures through 8-bit games. So you'll see that most of my graphics and music tend toward the pink and cutesy side.<br /><br />Hope this helps the discussion!

Although I am also a big fan of Castlevania which definitely isn't &quot;cute&quot; so this doesn't mean everything.

That includes the cute, but also other styles. Realistic stuff is boring because of the lack of character, and looks weird because it's never real enough.
