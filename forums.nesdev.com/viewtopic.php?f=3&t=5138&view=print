<br />
<br />The ppu memory $4000-FFFF is a set of mirrors of $0000-$3FFF..
<br />Then I do this.
<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">&nbsp; if &#40;address &gt;= 0x4000&#41; &#123;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; address &amp;= 0x3FFF;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &#125;</div><br /><br />But ... isn't better just made logical operation with all addresses?<br />  <div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; address &amp;= 0x3FFF;</div><br />I guess what is better? (check all the time or just made the operation o' the time)<br /><br />-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />I'm work with 262 scanlines.... I've read somewhere.. (I guess was on NinTech.txt) the following scheme:<br /><br /><strong>At 0 Scanline:</strong><br />                    ppuStatus.moreThan8ObjectsOnScanLine = NotSetted;<br />                    ppuStatus.verticalBlankStarted = NotInVBlank;<br />                    SpriteRAM.reset();<br /><strong>Between 1 and 240 Scanline:</strong><br />                    Normal scanline fetch<br />                    #1 - Name Table ==&gt; Tile Number<br />                    #2 - Attribute Table ==&gt; For that Tile<br />                    #3 - Pattern Table 0 and 1<br />                    #4 - Check all the Sprites(prior and positions)                     <br /><strong>Between 241 and 242 Scanline:</strong><br />                    I don't know what this scanlines does... what?<br /><strong>Between 243 and 262 Scanline:</strong><br />                    ppuStatus.verticalBlankStarted = InVBlank;<br />                    If the scanline is #262 I reset the scanline counter to 0.<br />                    During this period I check all the time if ppuControl.executeNMIOnVBlank is setted and execute the :<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">&nbsp; &nbsp; public void nmi&#40;&#41; &#123;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; flagBreak = 0;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; push&#40;&#40;&#40;&#40;programCounter + 1&#41; &gt;&gt; 8&#41; &amp; 0xFF&#41;&#41;;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; push&#40;&#40;&#40;programCounter + 1&#41; &amp; 0xFF&#41;&#41;;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; push&#40;processorStatus&#40;&#41;&#41;;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; flagIRQ = 1;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; programCounter = get16BitLittleEndian&#40;Memory&#91;InterruptNMI&#93;, Memory&#91;InterruptNMI + 1&#93;&#41;;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; cycles += 7;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &#125;</div>
<br />
<br />Need I to reset the SPR-RAM? (I mean clean it?)
<br />Exist this 0 Scanline?
<br />Am I forgetting anything on scanline scheme?

<br />
<br />Usually, yes.  Conditionals are often slower than just doing a simple operation because they can disrupt the pipeline.  I would recommend ditching the if() statement in this case.
<br />
<br />Regarding the frame layout, it's something like this:
<br />
<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">-------------------------------<br />&nbsp;1 &quot;Idle&quot; Scanline&nbsp; &nbsp;&#40;aka, Scanline 240&#41;<br />-------------------------------&nbsp; &nbsp;&lt;--- NMI occurs here, $2002.7 goes high here<br />&nbsp;20 scanlines of VBlank<br />-------------------------------&nbsp; &nbsp;&lt;--- $2002 cleared here &#40;all 3 bits&#41;<br />&nbsp;1 &quot;Prerender&quot; Scanline &#40;aka, Scanline -1&#41;<br />-------------------------------<br /><br />&nbsp;240 rendered scanlines &#40;aka Scanlines 0-239&#41;<br /><br />-------------------------------<br /></div>
<br />
<br />Since this is a repeating pattern, you may see it in a different order (VBlank at top, Idle at bottom).  It doesn't really matter what's on "top" as long as the order doesn't change.
<br />
<br />Every scanline is exactly 341 dots long (aka 341 PPU cycles).  The exception is the pre-render scanline which is sometimes 340 dots.
<br />
<br /><strong>VBlank</strong>
<br />Nothing happens.  PPU is not in rendering, safe to write to $2007, etc
<br />
<br /><strong>240 Rendered Scanlines</strong>
<br />Pixels output to the screen for dots 0-255.  PPU is constantly busy fetching data if rendering is enabled.  Not safe to write to $2007
<br />
<br /><strong>Prerender Scanline</strong>
<br /><em>Exactly</em> the same as a normal Rendered scanline in every way except for the following:
<br />
<br />1) No pixels output (but tiles are still fetched!)
<br />2) Scroll Reset (loopy_v = loopy_t) occurs on dot 304 if rendering is enabled.  This is <em>in addition to</em> all of the other scroll changes made to loopy_v that take place during rendering time.
<br />
<br /><strong>Idle Scanline</strong>
<br />Same as VBlank (PPU effectively does nothing) -- but not really part of VBlank because NMI doesn't occur until after it.
<br />
<br />
<br /><strong>Other Key Things To Note:</strong>
<br />- $2002.7 (VBlank flag) is raised on dot 0 of the first scanline of VBlank.  This is what triggers the NMI -- so NMI also occurs here.
<br />
<br />- All 3 bits of $2002 are cleared (VBlank flag, Sprite-0 hit, and sprite overflow) on dot 0 of the pre-render scanline (just as VBlank ends).
<br />
<br />- You never clear Sprite RAM
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />I'm too lazy to go over all the details of what goes in during the scanline.  Maybe I'll post later -- or at least find a post where I (or someone else) went over all of this already (I know I have before)

<br />Thanks very much for your effort and explanations here.  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /> 
<br />I was so fool when I think that if I could write one SChip8 emulator I would write an nes too... Now I'm seeing I realy don't know nothing about computers! (my initial goal was to have at least one game running within one mounth... :S) 
<br />
<br />This is the kind of good pain ... I want to make it real, I'm on the way, without this community I probably would had stopped... Thanks you all
<br />
<br />(  I was wondering, the guy who made the first nes emulator IS A PERSON OUTSIDE OF NORMAL LIMITS )

<br />Of course they ignored tons of details (probably not on purpose, they most likely didn't know about them), which made the task quite easier. The first emulators had serious timing and PPU issues.
