In 2007 or so I had considered creating Nomolos on XNA for the XBox 360 and windows. However, I knew I couldn't quit my day job or otherwise arrange my relatively balanced life so that I could kill myself over it to get it in the store before the technology changed, so I picked the NES. Sure enough, not long after I finished Nomolos for the NES Microsoft announced they were not supporting XNA anymore. Sure, if I had done it for that platform I could port it, but...it's hard enough for me to find time to build the games, period. Having a platform like the NES that is required to never change is perfect if you want to do a game programming hobby but not have it consume your entire lifestyle. Throw in that I grew up with the system, my favorite games are on it, I'm a huge fan of 8 bit music, and it makes it even more of an obvious choice (for me)<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3735">GradualGames</a> — Thu Feb 12, 2015 10:15 am</p><hr />

It's part nostalgia, but partly because it is a really nice foil against modern software development. In other words, it is really nice to feel like you're building a whole world from the ground up, without depending on fifty github projects, ten browsers, stack overflow, google, and ISP providers all at once. Plus, the NES is so widely emulated, that any game you make is likely to work 50 years from now just because of the strong historical interest there will be in keeping emulators up to date. Make a game for the PC, and the ever changing landscape of languages and open source libraries will likely require significant effort to keep working for that long. I could be wrong, maybe C/SDL (for example) will allow code to run 50 years from now without any modification, but I doubt it...seems much more likely that would be true for the NES, whose requirements are totally solidified and cannot change, the only requirement is that when more emulators are written, that the system emulation itself behaves exactly the same.<br /><br />Tangential: (no pun intended...see the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clavichord" class="postlink">clavichord</a> wikipedia article <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br />As for emulating a clavichord with a synthesizer, one typically encounters the &quot;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clavinet" class="postlink">clavinet</a>,&quot; which is not a clavichord but a modern electric equivalent, which is essentially a keyboard attached to an electric guitar, doing &quot;hammer ons&quot; for each note. A real acoustic clavichord is based on the same principles but sounds and feels much different. I've only ever heard a clavichord sound on a synthesizer once, and it wasn't remotely like the real thing. For instance, you can make any note have vibrato just by bouncing the key. Most synths have a wheel for doing vibrato, which is much more constrained as to what you can do with it. Maybe some synths have pressure sensitive keys that could emulate vibrato, but even then it won't be the same. The quiet acoustics of the instrument would be nearly impossible to emulate properly. Plus, it's fun to feel the string vibrate directly through the key you have depressed, as when you hold down a key it is actually in contact with the string on the other end. There's just nothing like it.<br /><br />Back on topic:<br />My sincere hope is the NES (and other systems and games from the era) will still be valued many many years from now. Maybe I'm wrong but I don't see why interest in something as old and irrelevant to modern culture as the clavichord isn't enough evidence that this phenomenon can occur with almost anything.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3735">GradualGames</a> — Tue Feb 10, 2015 9:53 am</p><hr />

Also the fact that what you could do in old systems can be done with exactly the same results in new systems, much more easily, and it even allows you to break the rules. The only reason to develop on an old system is to see if you can get it working with the real constraints being enforced.<br /><br />Sure, you can use modern waveform-based synthesizers to do clavichord sounds too, but in this case it isn't necessarily easier (especially not when it comes to doing the subtle parts, there it may actually become <em>harder</em>).<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=4526">Sik</a> — Sat Feb 07, 2015 5:25 am</p><hr />

Just my two cents: My favorite musical instrument is the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clavichord" class="postlink">clavichord</a>, which is first known to have appeared in the early 14th century. It's the predecessor to the piano and it still has a following today. Quite small and obscure, but I'd say there are perhaps several thousand people worldwide who appreciate its virtues. I suspect old video game consoles will have a similar fate. To me, old video games have a timeless, almost mythical value to them, much like old books, or old music. It seems every creative era starts out with things that are simple, constrained, and symbolic. It makes me wonder if humanity's gradually evolved tendency to communicate in symbols means that every time a new creative medium is invented, the first masterpieces made in that medium will always be the most highly regarded, because inevitably successors in a given medium will increase the complexity to the point where that deeply innate tendency to respond to simplicity is eroded.<br /><br />I'm hoping to still be playing the clavichord, and writing games for the NES til I'm too old to see or hear, hahahahah.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3735">GradualGames</a> — Fri Feb 06, 2015 10:21 am</p><hr />

The ideal future goal is synthesis onto an FPGA or eventually an ASIC from a definition written in an HDL to perform a potentially perfect recreation of the system. This also makes compatibility with old hardware not hard at all, and you remove a lot of layers that introduce delays in both the input and output from the whole setup.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=5314">mikejmoffitt</a> — Mon Jan 26, 2015 12:20 pm</p><hr />

I guess you could say that I have &quot;nostalgia&quot; for the SNES (even though, like I said, I lost it in my garage and found it when I moved many years latter) but I only really got to play it about three years ago. I honestly just find older games a bit more enjoyable, due to the fact that they don't feel like they drag on forever, and there's no tutorials or cut scenes or those idiotic quick time events to break up the pace. I feel it takes me about as much time to complete an SNES game as it does to complete and Xbox 360 or one or whatever game, not because it's as long, but because I don't feel like I can blaze through everything on my first try. (Beating R-Type III the first time for me was literally a 3-day event, even though you can easily beat the game in an hour.) One thing I really like doing stuff on the SNES is that it really doesn't look that bad (I'd say it's aged 10x better than the original PlayStation's 3D titles) even for today, and I'm not counting looking &quot;retro&quot; but legitimately alright. From what I've heard, its the perfect balance of looks and programming simplicity for a 2D based system.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">tokumaru wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"><br />The hardware will probably be gone not too long from now<br /></div><br />Why?

While it's true that the majority of NES enthusiasts are motivated by nostalgia, this isn't always the case. I believe that everything that was once relevant will not die easily. Take music for example: a lot of people still like artists that aren't around anymore, even if they weren't born when said artists were active. People still cover their songs and are inspired by them. Significant things are hard to forget, and are always around one way or another.<br /><br />Sure, there will obviously be a decrease in the number of NES homebrews as people who grew up with it &quot;retire&quot; or die, but as long as computers are here, games will exist, programmers will exist, and old consoles are a big part of computing and gaming history, so the NES is sure to get some attention from a few intrigued programmers at least.<br /><br />Not everyone is exclusively interested in the present... There are a lot of people today researching old civilizations and using old techniques to build or create things, for research or even for fun.<br /><br />The hardware will probably be gone not too long from now, but many people are working hard to document everything as well as possible and preserve all the software, so we can at least count on emulation or simulation. I really expect computers in the not-so-distant future to be able to run simulations of electronic circuits fast enough to run a perfect replica of the old consoles in real time.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=95">tokumaru</a> — Sat Jan 24, 2015 9:58 pm</p><hr />

I was just recently thinking about how people today in 2015 are still developing for the NES a console made in the 1980's and wondered. Would people still develop for this system 50 years from now?<br /><br />I think one of the main reasons why people still developing for the NES today is because was a very popular console. Many people including myself owned on. Some of those people who owned one also probably thought about what it would be like to make their own game and have it run on that console. <br /><br />The NES it seems just carries a huge legacy behind it. Many great games were made for the console and many franchises like Metroid and others debuted on this system which still exist today. To me the NES wasn't important because of how fast its processor was or any of its other specs. For me the NES was important because I spent a lot of time playing on it and many important games were made for it. <br /><br />One of the reasons why I personally want to make some games for the NES is because the system just means a lot to me. So because I care about the system that's what motivates me to want to develop games for it.  <br /><br />And so I've wondered, maybe developing games for older systems is related to having owned the system when that person was younger. If you were a kid when you had your NES then maybe you might have a tendency to want to develop for it when your an adult. So now I ask, what about the next generation? What will happen to development to systems when the generations of people who owned them isn't around anymore?<br /><br />Would my future grand kids ever want to make a homebrew game for an older system? Wouldn't they be more interested in their newest system and not some outdated one? <br /><br />It's true that some kids might not have an NES laying around at their house at the present when they grow up, but instead have PS4 and Xbox and so on, but what kids do have that older generations didn't is a greater access to older games more than ever before. <br /><br />I remember only having just a few NES games when it first came out and getting a new game was a big deal. Now, kids have access to the full library of most older consoles. So because of emulators and the ease of getting the games online this might actually inspire a whole new generation of developers so when they get older they too may want to make their own games.<br /><br />I think the most interesting thing about computer games is that they don't seem to die with time. Just the other day I was searching on youtube for  a play through of some old retro game and many of the videos that pulled up were recently made.  <br /><br />It seems to me that people really don't care if the game is old and if the graphics are primitive by today's standards. The only really thing that matters is whether the game is fun to play or not. <br /><br />So I think that people will still be making new homebrews for older systems for many years to come. <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=6785">Erockbrox</a> — Sat Jan 24, 2015 8:18 pm</p><hr />
