There's the NES, of course, and it competed with the Sega Master System and Atari 7800 in the home console market.  There were also home computers that were also used as gaming devices, the Commodore 64 and the MSX2.  I recall reading that the SMS could, I believe, access DMA during V-Blank while the NES could only do so at the end of V-Blank.  On the flip side, it was slower.  And while it may have been clocked at a higher speed, a 4MHz Z80 is allegedly as powerful and capable as a 2MHz 6502, and despite having superior graphical abilities, it had the exact same sprite display limitations as the NES.<br /><br />But I want to know more about the other machines, how they worked, what strengths and weaknesses they each had, and how was software development across each platform.

The Master System can even pull off good looking fighting games like Masters of Combat without having to resort to the trick of drawing fighters to the background, like happens with Mortal Kombat and Street Fighter.<br /><br />Another aspect about the SMS that is different from the NES is that each tile in the tile map has a priority bit indicating whether it should be drawn in front of or behind the sprites. This makes it easier to build a complex scene with background and foreground objects. On the NES, drawing priority is defined for each sprite instead, which is more versatile, but harder/slower to control, and some types of sprite masking that are trivial on the SMS, such as walking behind a pillar, require extra sprites on the NES, so they can't be abused.<br /><br />The SMS was a pretty good machine, and it's a shame we didn't get to see more games exploring its full potential. It would be awesome to have more games like Daffy Duck in Hollywood, Donald Duck: Deep Duck Trouble, Dynamite Headdy, Chuck Rock II, Ninja Gaiden, Land of Illusion, and so on...

Graphically it's fairly advanced, but the sound always ruins the experience for me. There's no bass, no punch to the music at all and that could've been solved with another frequency divider between the Z80 and the SN76489 to make up for the 10-bit period resolution. A lot of games also had very simplistic music, using simple decaying envelopes for everything, which also sounds very weak due to the logarithmic volume. (This could be because bankswitching never was fashionable on Sega consoles) I honestly don't know if there ever was a worse sound chip in game systems in that era (not counting the PAULA in the 2600, that lovely piece of detuned nightmare) , even the AY-3-8910/YM2149F was better despite only having three channels. It could go even lower than the NES triangle and also create bass tones with its incredibly fast envelope generator.

Graphics were on par with NES and SNES as well and they worked on the same screens so it was a fair comparison - not something like VGA versus EGA versus composite NTSC versus component NTSC(RGB) versus SVHS(S-connector).  Processing speed was about the same as well, for obvious reasons.  One thing that really makes game system versus home computer comparisons unfair is actually in the console's favor.  I'm talking about the patents that prevented home computers from using stuff like hardware sprites, although they did find some alternatives.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />If sprites were patented broadly then it's very likely only one system would have had sprites at all. Also it was common for many computers back then to support sprites, it's just that their sprite support was kind of lackluster in comparison (you needed multiplexing to get more than just a handful of objects out of sprites). Also the TMS9918 had some important sprite support (32 sprites on screen!) and it was originally made for computers.<br /><br />I'm pretty sure there were patents on sprites but those were patents on the specific implementations used in each hardware (down to the smallest details), so that wouldn't have really prevented using the concept of sprites elsewhere. Patent trolling wasn't common back then.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />So basically, it seems like there was no truly superior console, as they each had their own quirks that made development easier or harder.  Except the Atari 7800, it seems like it had absolutely no chance.  From what screenshots I've seen of its games, it seems you could use 8 palettes of three colors (and I assume transparency) just like the NES, except you could use those palettes anywhere and for anything.  Palettes weren't exclusive to either sprites or backgrounds, which allowed for greater freedom than the NES.<br /><br />I included the MSX2 and C64 because they seem to be fan favorites in the retrogaming community, as they have some exclusive titles that haven't been ported to anything else, such as MG2 and Konami's other games for the MSX2, and... whatever the C64 had.  Similarly to the Atari 7800, it seemed like the C64's pixels were actually twice as wide as other consoles, and it had only one palette of 16 colors (very bad colors might I add), and those colors could be used anywhere on the screen, not limited to a grid.
