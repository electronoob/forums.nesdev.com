OK, as you may or may not know, I'm making a homebrew game for the Mega Drive called <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RyJAoC1K9KE" class="postlink">Project MD</a>. It's just some generic platforms game. What am I doing talking about this here then? Well, you probably know about the whole console wars deal back in the day, so I was wondering, wouldn't it be possible for somebody in the SNES homebrew community to make a Project SNES? (yes, I'm actually asking for competition)<br /><br />As you can imagine, the idea for Project SNES is to be the counterpart of Project MD, so basically it should try to be somewhat similar. Project MD is a platforms game, and it's set in a virtual world, so you'll probably want to have Project SNES be something along those lines too.<br /><br />Now, though, some rules, so we can play on an even field:<br /><ul><li>Don't use code you aren't legally allowed to use (e.g. code borrowed from commercial games).</li><li>Avoid referencing Nintendo explicitly. "SNES" is the most you can do. This also means no Mario cameos and such.</li><li>Actually, avoid anything that's illegal, period.</li><li>Must be able to work on real hardware. Basically, don't rely on emulator bugs.</li><li>Don't use custom chips (this includes extra processors or memory).</li><li>As an exception to the above, you can include extra memory for storing savegames and settings.</li><li>Don't require add-ons. Also, it must provide support for the standard controller (d'oh!).</li><li>Both SlowROM and FastROM are OK. Use whatever fits you.</li><li>Don't use bank switching, stick to what the standard SNES memory mapping provides you.</li><li>Abusing the SNES hardware itself to do crazy things is OK.</li><li>Compressing data is OK too... although please avoid very noticeable loading times, they suck x_X</li><li>I currently have no plans of referencing Project SNES from my game, so I guess it should be like that the other way as well. If anything, contact me in case such a cross reference is wanted.</li><li>Yes, you can make a team to develop this game, no need to be a single person. If you do, though, make sure you have somebody who actually does the duties of a leader. I've seen other projects get stuck because they don't have somebody to impose the final decisions...</li></ul><br />If you need to ask anything, post here and I'll try to reply whenever I can.<br /><br />So, is anybody out there willing to do it?<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=4526">Sik</a> — Thu Aug 12, 2010 3:52 am</p><hr />
