Several NES games play back audio waveforms through timed writes to $4011. You can identify these in an NES debugger by catching dozens of writes to $4011 in one frame, or you can identify them without a debugger by finding missing samples in the NSF, incompatibility with PocketNES, etc.<br /><br />Many of these games, such as <em>Smash TV</em>, <em>Skate Or Die 2</em>, and one of the <em>Wheel of Fortune</em> games, use raw 4-bit samples at a rather low sampling rate. This sounds bad but sometimes better than a DPCM sample at 4x the rate, and it allows playback of longer samples on mappers that hardwire $C000-$FFFF, albeit with pausing in the action.<br /><br />Hi Tech's Sesame Street games with sampled voices, <em>Big Bird's Hide and Speak</em> and <em>Sesame Street Countdown</em>, use a different audio compression engine. It runs at 8 kHz and roughly 48 kbps (average 6 bits per sample). I've traced a bit of it, not having the patience to trace through the whole thing, and it seems to involve variable length coding of sample differences using 8 different word formats. Based on the bitrate, I'd almost guess that this is actually a lossless codec.<br /><br />I'm in the middle of developing a codec that uses sample-to-sample differences but on a logarithmic scale with 15 distinct differences (4-bit), so that it doesn't slope-overload but doesn't get too granular either. It sounds much better than raw 4-bit audio but somewhat worse than the Sesame Street games. <br /><br />Has anybody else either developed a $4011 codec or disassembled a commercial NES game's codec?<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=9">tepples</a> â€” Sat Jan 08, 2005 10:11 pm</p><hr />
