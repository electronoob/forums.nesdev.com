		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Hi, I'm totally new to all of this, but I have some questions. I want to ask my girlfriend to marry me, and want to be a BIT different (lol nerd joke). My girlfriend and I are avid Dr. Mario players and I would like to mod Dr. Mario to ask the question for me. I have found someone to put it on an 8 bit cartridge for me, so I know that is possible, but I don't know how I would go about modding the game, and making it ready to put on the cartridge. If anyone could help out a total noob it would be GREATLY appreciated.
<br />
<br />I would settle for the tittle screen asking the question, but if I could get the screen after someone wins in a battle, that would be optimal. I have no programming background, but I am a graphic designer. Thanks so much for even reading this post!

<br />When are you going to ask her?
<br />If it's in a long time, we might can cook up the last one there.

<br />Could it be an idea to have the Dr. Mario title screen, and when you press start, it's written with big letters "Will you, *name*, marry me?"  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />

If so, that would make it really easy with the right tool (a hex editor w/ a relative search feature).  Making it longer would require some actual hacking.  Editing the title screen is possible, possibly the easiest.  But it depends on how it stores the data (usually you can find it by (relative) search for any text that's already there.
<br />
<br />In any event you'll need a hex editor for editing the files.
<br />
<br />Good luck, as for myself I am currently engaged to get married.
<br />
<br />A few years ago I made an SMB hack for someone to propose with, though I ended up never hearing back from him.  It has Mario changed to be the princess from SMB2.  The koopas are little Luigis (!).  It was pretty funny.

<br />Because I think it would be easiest to just rip the title screen into it's own rom, and do some more magic after that <img src="./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" /> 
<br />Like, you choose 1 or 2 player, and instead of game difficulty, it proposes, with Yes and No as alternatives <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />
<br />
<br />I think the idea of making a game you both love ask the question, is genius <img src="./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" />

If we could still play that would be amazing because we could play with this version permanently. I mean there is a screen that loads after the round is done, and preferably, I would like to mod that. The further in to the game the better, I think it will add to the excitement of it. I just don't know how hard this all would be.
<br />
<br />But I would settle to have the screen after the first screen pop the question. Like use the first screen again and just change the text, and change the 1/2 player to yes or no... But the end of the game would be the best!
<br />
<br />Thanks... We play this game A LOT.

My idea is to have it on Tetris the Tengen version then when she gets to the end of the level and the dancers come out there is text asking the question. I always get there first but I could forfeit this one time.
<br />
<br />How possible is this idea guys, how long would it take to teach me how to do it on my own.

<br />If you'll take Tetris, not Dr. Mario, I could probably customize Tetramino for you. All I'd need would be a wav/mp3/ogg/whatever of you saying "Will you marry me?".

<br />The message box that pops up spans 6 characters horizontally and 7 vertically (not counting the frame). You would just need to come up with some text to put in there.
<br />
<br />If you are looking for a guide for text editing I would suggest <a href="http://www.zophar.net/documents/nes/art-of-romhacking.html" class="postlink">The Art of ROM Hacking</a>. Just note when you make a table file you may have to format it this way "00=0" instead of "00 0". I guess it depends on the program.
<br />
<br />The message box starts at address 000028AC and ends at 000028E1 (I am using PRG1).

<br />I've seen people hack their own levels, could this be done in a similar way?

I suppose the palette would need to be changed too so it wouldn't turn completely black in 20 hi as well as to make it more aesthetically pleasing.
<br />
<br />If you start off with 20 hi you would see the cut scene after you beat the level (Edit: but you already knew that).
