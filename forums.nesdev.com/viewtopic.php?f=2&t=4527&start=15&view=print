<br />I may have, but later found that it's only after pressing the reset button that they are ignored, or if powering up less than 20 seconds after having last been powered up, not after a "cold" powerup. See the <a href="http://nesdevwiki.org/index.php/Power-up_state_of_PPU" class="postlink">Wiki page about PPU powerup</a>.

<br />In that piece of code, it was probably to get the PPU address register away from the palette area. When it's within the palette area and rendering is off, the color pointed by it gets rendered instead of color 0. If the address register is not pointing at any color, color 0 gets drawn.
<br />
<br />Some people, however, insist on resetting the scroll by writing to $2006, even though $2005 and $2000 are enough to do it.

<br />Even worse, when I play games I usually plug the game in, power the console on, power the TV on and then spend some time so that channel '4' is selected (other channels are snow), so the player isn't likely to watch the screen for 20 seconds after a cold reset.
<br />This is different for a warm reset, tough.

<br />So, by "the player" you mean you, basically? =)
<br />
<br />I'm very different. I guess I have some sort of Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder... By the time I turn the console on, all cables must be already connected and the TV set to the proper input. Then I usually position my hand over the button but will not press it until I'm looking at the screen again. I want to know everything that's going on, and if the game does something weird at power-on I'll want to see it.
