They also seem to fail on my potentially out-of-date Nestopia and fairly recent copy of Nintendulator.<br />I imagine the tests pass on a real NES, but I do not have any way to personally verify this...<br /><br />Your 3 tests do pass on puNES &amp; Nintendulator, so I'll definitely take a look at those and the DMC test, too.<br />Thanks again!<br /><br />P.S: tvpassfail does pass, if you enable the NTSC filter :)

First of all, half frame and quarter frame can be generated only on odd cycles. But for 0x4017 it is actually generated on reset_cycle - 1, because reset (as well as any other change of framelfsr) can happen only on even cycle. But if both frame counter and 0x4017 generates half_frame, quarter_frame there still would be only one clock committed.<br /></div><br />If someone can explain what I meant there please tell me I am curious too.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Like the Wiki says, writing to $4017 has a delayed effect (applied 3 or 4 cycles later, to correspond with an odd cycle?).<br />Writing with bit 7 set to $4017 clocks the half/quarter frames, but does so after the 3/4 cycles delay (this wasn't implemented in my emu).<br />Additionally, it looks like if the frame counter is reset at or around the same time it clocks the half/quarter frames through its normal process, the extra frame clock that is normally caused by a write to $4017 (with the high bit set) does not occur.<br /><br />Implementing both of these behaviors makes Mesen pass all of these tests (1 to 11) - although I am unsure of how accurate my implementation is vs the actual NES.<br /><br />Thanks for making those tests!

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />The Kick Master issue was caused by a race condition (write to $2006 at the same time as the cycle 256 Y scrolling increment).  The game expects the $2006 value to win and the scrolling increment to be ignored (but it wasn't), which produced the weird effect on the title screen.<br /><br />The Incredible Crash Dummies is apparently not an MMC3 game, but uses the MC-ACC chip which has a slightly different IRQ behavior.  I implemented the behavior for it and it fixes the game, but this currently relies on proper NES 2.0 headers (submapper 3) since I'm not sure I want to start putting hash checks into Mesen..<br /><br />As for Battletoads freezing in Dendy mode:  Dendy mode was incorrectly giving 21 scanlines worth of vblank after firing the NMI, instead of 20, which caused Battletoads to freeze.  Both games seem to work correctly now.<br /><br />Thanks to the both of you for the bug reports!

I changed the code so that a write to $2006 that updates the vram address and occurs at that point (post 255, pre 256) will cause the PPU to ignore the Y scrolling increment on cycle 256, preserving the new value that the CPU has written instead (<a href="https://bitbucket.org/Souryo/mesen/commits/d773401a435ce2c6e2bd84416f09faa81aaabdf1" class="postlink">Commit</a>).  This fixes Kick Master in my case, and is the only fix I found that did not break any test rom.
