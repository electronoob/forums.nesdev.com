<br />Yet hobbyists port FCEUX and Snes9x to every newly cracked console as it appears. It appears to be the "hello world" of homebrew. So why <em>shouldn't</em> a publisher port its classic games to every console in an effort to satisfy players' desires before the ROM pirates do?

<br />Because they <em>should</em> invest their time and skills into developing good new games instead. (not crap like FF12 or FF13 as good new games).
<br />
<br />And I think SNES9x has been available for the PSP for year, I remember someone showed it to me some 4 or 5 years ago, so FF4 has been playable on that platform all the way along. Not to mention it should be possible to play an ISO of FF4 PS1 or an emulated FF4 Advance too on the PSP  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=":wink:" title="Wink" />

<br />In other words: "A work of authorship published in an obsolete format should not be rereleased in a new format. For example, any movie that has been distributed on VHS tapes shouldn't be remastered for DVD or Blu-ray." Did I misunderstand you? Because if I didn't, they'd also have to invest their legal department's time and skills into suing people who keep their good old games alive, and they'd have to invest their PR department's time and skills into fending off boycotts of the publisher.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />The good thing is that nobody forces you to buy remakes (at least for now while games are still distributed in physical media), if you don't like them, just don't buy them. You can't really expect a company to acknowledge that a game can already be played on a system through piracy on a certain platform and use that as a reason to not release a remake of said game on said platform.

<br />
<br />FFIV hasn't been remade six times. The PS1 version was a direct port. The wonderswan conversion was an enhanced port, but still a port. The GBA version was a port of the Wonderswan version with some slight tweaks. On Wii it's only Virtual Console so that means a port of the SNES version. 
<br />
<br />There are only two remakes - the 3D rough polygon one on the DS and this "HD 2D" version on the PSP. 
<br />
<br />Two remakes of one of the bes classic RPGs of all time that are very different from each other isn't too much. The only thing I hope is that V and VI will receive the same treatment before PSP support dries up. I love IV don't get me wrong, but I feel it was bested by the other two 16-bit FFs to follow, especially VI.

<br />
<br />The game I choose for review was Dark Void, a game my gaming peers seems to have hated, but I enjoyed quite a bit. Agree? Disagree? Fall somewhere in between? Let me hear about it.
<br />
<br />Anyway guys, enjoy!
