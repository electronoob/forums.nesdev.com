		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Well, I received an unmodified mobo (thanks bunnyboy), and I did see some very minor "glitching" with it, it was similar to what I saw on PAL NES, i.e. some of the "subpixels" (on my HDTV) around some lines were flickering when a program was polling $2000, but stopped when it wasn't. This is quite hard to notice though, and not what I saw when I posted the "twitching" ROM.
<br />
<br />So, as far as I understand this, this thing was a combination of couple of things. First of all, when I did the wiring to hook up the signals to my FPGA, the /CS and register select bits of the PPU were right next to the clock wire, and were glitching up the clock. FPGA saw the clock glitches as extra clocks, so that's where the erroneous SignalTap logs came from. I actually didn't think of this at all at the time I did the logs (due to inexperience with hardware) but it seems very obvious now.
<br />
<br />As for the minor "glitches" in video output in an unmodified PAL/NTSC NES, I'm guessing the /CS and the 3 register select pins/traces are adding a small amount of interference to the composite video output of the PPU.
<br />
<br />So to conclude, the only somewhat interesting find here seems to be that the polling of PPU regs does seem to be adding a very small amount of noise to the video signal. It's practically unnoticeable though. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />

<br />I doubt it, but that's a strange problem indeed. I've never noticed anything like that.
