Which means no NMI interrupt happens at the start of each frame. (Because bit 7 of $2000 is clear)<br /><br />So after your setup code is done, set bit 7 of $2000. What this causes to start happening is an NMI "interrupt". An interrupt actually interrupts whatever your program was doing before the interrupt, and starts running something else. When that "something else" is done, it returns to where it was before the interrupt took place. <br /><br />This is how nmis will change, even though your current loop does nothing to change it.<br /><br />So while your main loop is doing this:<br /><br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">&nbsp; &nbsp;lda nmis<br />:&nbsp; &nbsp;cmp nmis<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;beq :-<br /></div><br /><br />Eventually, a new frame will start. When that happens, your code will be interrupted and jmp to your NMI routine. Your NMI routine will change the variable nmis, and then return allowing your main loop to continue down.<br /><br />I don't know how to set the NMI vectors with your current setup, but you need to put the address for the NMI routine directly before the address of your reset vector.<br /><br />Edit: Here is a quick NMI to get you started that should at least get you out of that loop:<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">nmi:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;pha;The interrupt might have happened when you were doing something important<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;tya;So we save the registers to the stack<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;pha;And restore them later so that when it<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;txa;Returns, the same values will be in them.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;pha<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;inc nmis<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;pla;Restoring the registers<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;tax;From the stack.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;pla<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;tay<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;pla<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;rti;Return from interrupt<br /></div>

<br />
<br />That doesn't do anything with the stack pointer. Not that it matters. You already set the stack pointer at the beginning of your program. Once you transfer a number from X to the stack pointer (they are not the same thing) with TXS, you can use X for whatever you like. If you're not going to use the #$FF in X you loaded right then for something, there's no need to do it.
<br />
<br />In short: 
<br />
<br />1. Changing X won't change the stack pointer unless you use TXS.
<br />2. You don't need to change the stack pointer again since you set it up already.

<br />That's sort of how I feel. I *think* I understand it, and then later I find out that I was wrong. Anyways, I've certainly never programmed something where I have to take care of things like vblanks and interrupts before. I admit, lots of it seems cryptic. I apologize if it seems like I'm wasting your time.

<br />It goes like this: before the warm up, write 0 to both PPU registers (the purpose here is to "reset" the PPU... kinda), and after the warm up you write the actual configuration you're gonna use (this includes enabling NMIs).

I always thought those registers started with an unknown state, which isn't true. Even if they did start at something unknown, writes to them are also totally ignored for the first few frames.<br /><br />What tokumaru posted is what I was describing, but <a href="http://wiki.nesdev.com/w/index.php/PPU_power_up_state" class="postlink">the wiki says</a> you don't need to. <br /><br />I'll probably still do it to be safe, because I am paranoid. <br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">I don't understand yours. You push a bunch of stuff onto the stack only to pop it off in the very same routine after only incrementing nmis.</div><br /><br />Exactly. I explained why it does that in the comments, but Tepples makes a good point. The NMI I posted currently <em>doesn't</em> affect the status registers, but the idea would be that you add on to it once you're passed this hurdle.<br /><br />Here's a real world example of why the pushing and popping is done.<br /><br />Imagine this code is in your main routine:<br /><br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">&nbsp; &nbsp;lda #$FF<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;ldx #$00<br />loop:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;sta $0200,x<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;inx<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;inx<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;inx<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;inx<br />;*<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;bne loop<br />;We can continue only when X is exactly 0. I've used code like to remove all sprites from the screen &#40;by putting their y position below the screen&#41;.<br /></div><br /><br />Now imagine this is your nmi routine. It interrupts at some point during the loop. Say... where that * is.<br /><br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">nmi:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;inc nmis<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;lda #$20;This <span class="posthilit">line</span> will cause a #$20 to be written instead of #$FF<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;sta $2006<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;ldx #$03;This <span class="posthilit">line</span> will cause an infinite loop.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;sta $2006<br />&nbsp; <br />&nbsp; &nbsp;ldy #$00<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;sta $2007<br />;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;rti<br /></div><br /><br />When that code returns you're in an infinite loop, because the nmi changed X to something that makes completing the loop impossible.<br /><br />Can (4*Z+3)%256 ever equal 0? <br />(Z = the number of times we have looped)<br /><br />No. But (4*Z+0)%256 can be 0 which would allow your main loop to continue.<br /><br />We push the registers to the stack in the NMI because it can interrupt our code at ANY time. After they're pushed, we can safely change them in the NMI, and restore them when we're done for when we return.<br /><br />The inc nmis part might make sense now too. Because the opposite happens than this example. The nmi not changing that variable KEEPS us in an infinite loop when it should break us out of one.<br /><br />Is that clear? If not I'll try a different approach. Tepples also did an explanation of game loops where you can avoid pushing and pulling if you like.<br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">I know. My math routines use a stack based on the zeropage with x as the index register, as its stack pointer. That's what I meant by "stack pointer" here.</div>
<br />My bad. I'm a new guy in this thread, so I might have missed where that was mentioned. I'm just trying to make sure you're not doing anything you don't understand.

If so, even if $2000 and $2001 were set to something potentially harmful, you still couldn't do anything about it before the PPU was warmed up anyway.</div>
<br />Going out on a limb here, but I don't think so. As far as I understand, the reset <span class="posthilit">line</span> of the PPU simply isn't connected to the PPU on the Famicom, so when you push the reset button, PPU keeps running like nothing happened.
