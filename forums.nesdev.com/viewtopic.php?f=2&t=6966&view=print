<br />
<br />I have made a sub-routine "poll" which stores a 1 in "whitevar' variable whenever a white color is detected. Then the subroutine "change_white" would make all the sprites black except 1 in one NMI, it then polls it in the same NMI trying to detect a white. Then in the next NMI a second object is turned white and rest all are made black, then poll is called to detect white and so on

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />From what I can see so far, it looks like everything is happening in NMI (during vblank) and the main loop is an infinite JMP.
<br />
<br />With the Zapper, a photo-diode is connected directly to the NES port (it's not buffered).  I haven't tried to calculate the exact timing for how long it stays active.  In practice, you have to use a timed polling loop (or a timer of some sort) so you know which vertical screen position the hit occurred on.  Then you narrow down the horizontal position, by iterating through all the targets that are (still) in range on the next frame (by making the hitboxes white or not).  The more targets, the longer it will take since you can only iterate once per frame.
<br />
<br />You almost need a sprite-0 hit or something, so you can start the polling at a predetermined time.  I guess your code does, but with it being called from the NMI at first glance it doesn't look like it's running during the appropriate screen-rendering time (let me know if I got it wrong).

<br />Isn't that too hardcore for a newbie though? I mean, an experienced coder might make use of timed code to find the target faster, but AFAIK you can just make each target white during the course of several frames until you find the one that was hit, which is the simplest way to do it. Of course is only good if you have few possible targets, like 6 or so.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Yeah, that works OK too, for less targets.  But you still have to poll it the same way, during the frame rendering and during all the scanlines you want to check (it won't "remember" hitting it if you wait too long to read it).  So there really is no way to avoid using some sort of timed code.  From there it's pretty easy to increment a timer in that loop, and use it if it's useful (even if it's not exactly scanline-timed).

<br />
<br />2- Once you're timing the Y position, why not time the X position? I admit I'm only getting sextiles of the screen with my not particularly good loop (assuming that FCEU's zapper handling is correct)...

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />1. Mostly because you typically wouldn't want to overflow the frame time - you're gonna have to know how long you'll be polling it for.  So it doesn't have to be 100% exact, but you will want to know (at least roughly) how much CPU time, and how many scanlines, are being spent.
<br />
<br />2. I wondered about that, I didn't try it though.  But on the zapper test I did, it seemed like moving the gun horizontally was having no effect (but my code wasn't made to test H movement specifically).  Not sure I trust the emulators on stuff like this (stuff that no game probably ever did).

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />For #2.
<br />I found that emulators do not seem to handle X location.  ie: they set the diode at the same point of every scanline.    
<br />
<br />For my half completed lightgun game, I used multiple blank screens.  Typically 3 or 4 in a row.  That still works out to 4 out of 60 frames (1/15 of a second) which I personally didnt have a problem with.
<br />
<br />The biggest killer for me was that not all emulators treat sprite DMA the same way.  Nintendulator does it right.  What worked for me in FCEUX would not work on real hardware or Nintendulator.  Since reading the diode happens in screen draw, all my manipulation was being done in NMI.  My sprite manipulation code took too long so I didnt have time in NMI to actually do the DMA.
