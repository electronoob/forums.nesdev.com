The brightness of 255 isn't absolute. TVs use RGB as well, converting RF/composite/component into RGB before the amplifiers. At that point, they are voltages from 0 to some maximum, which can be mapped to the 0-255 range. Analog electronics have limits as well, and so do phosphors, they're just working well within the limits. I believe that later CRTs did some digital processing on the signal, so they may very well have digitized each component (R, G, B) into some number of bits. It would be indistingishable if they used enough bits. Also remember that the gamma-to-linear conversion occurs mostly at the phosphors, so the digitized version would have favorable non-linearity that gave more precision in darker tones where the eye is more sensitive to smaller differences.

In my app, a &quot;sat&quot; of 1.0 is basically a color explosion at the moment, so I know that's not correct. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" /><br /><br />For now, <a href="http://drag.wootest.net/misc/palgen.html" class="postlink">I've updated the palette generator</a>. Some of the new tweak settings are from suggestions. The hue was me, because even though a hue tweak of 0.0 <em>should</em> represent the exact hues being sent, it still doesn't look right unless I shift them by -0.15. Your mileage may vary.<br /><br />A CRT TV technically has a &quot;gam&quot; of 2.2, and it does help a little bit for some of the darker colors, but it seems to mess everything else up right now. Meh.<br /><br />Also, if anyone has a better suggestion for gamut mapping (converting the out-of-gamut colors to in-gamut colors), I'm open to suggestions.<br /><br />Edit: If anyone's interested, <a href="http://drag.wootest.net/misc/palette.nes" class="postlink">this is what I've been using on my NES for comparison.</a> It's based on the older PALTEST.NES demo floating around here, but I needed to have the colors all touching each other. I tried to minimize the flickering glitches as much as I could. No emphasis toggling support though, sorry.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Depends on the television.<br /><br />The last DSP-based ones scaled luma by the size of the sync pulse (scaling the entire input such that sync-to-blank was 40IRE), separate out chroma, and scale that such that the colorburst is also 40IRE peak-to-peak.<br />I believe the older analog sets only scaled everything according to the sync pulse. (Since NTSC was amplitude modulated, some kind of compensation for the distance to the transmitter is needed).<br />Many sets <strong>don't</strong> do this scaling for composite input, however.<br /><br />OTOH, the 2600 has two variants, one which transmits its colorburst at the same amplitude as the rest of the color, and the other which attenuates the amplitude for the colorburst (ties /BLANK to CHROMA through a 680Ω resistor); I don't recall people have mentioned variation of saturation between the CX2600 and the CX2600A or the various mods (which largely seem to ignore /BLANK).

However, I haven't thrown out the possibility that the colorburst is mainly used for its phase and nothing else. If a picture is too saturated, you can just twist the saturation knob, so it's plausible.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I can suggest for the emulator to have two modes:<ul><li>NTSC mode: Set up the conversion matrix and attenuation amount.</li><li>RGB mode: Set up the 64-entry palette, tint mode, and extra dot mode.</li></ul><br />Therefore you have accurate emulation, and you can configure it, and it work both with games meant for NES and NTSC Famicom, and with games designed for RGB Famicom. And you can make it act like a black and white TV set by using only the Y signal in the conversion matrix, in case you want to test if the picture is good on black and white TV sets. And what I suggested also means, you can turn off the attenuation or set it whatever you want, allowing to test how it might look on clone systems with wrong attenuation, to not use it at all, or to use RGB tint bits to see if the game still works in that mode.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />To address the out-of-gamut colors, I'm trying out using some rendering intents, and the first one I'm trying is absolute colorimetric.<br /><br />So basically, the color's RGB is converted to CIEXYZ coordinates (X, Y, Z), and then converted to CIELuv coordinates (L, u, v).<br />I also have the CIExyY coordinates for the R, G, B primitives (the points on the XYZ graph which give you #FF0000, #00FF00, and #0000FF), which I've converted from xyY to XYZ and then to Luv.<br /><br />That's as far as I've gotten. I don't know what I'm doing, and I can't find anything helpful from a google search. I don't know what kind of 3D shape the sRGB primaries make; in 2D, they make a triangle, but in 3D, do they linearly connect to the white and black points to make a diamond shape, or is it supposed to be rounder?<br /><br />Ugh, I'm so confused. Whatever shape it makes, if the color is outside of that shape, then it's out of the sRGB range (meaning R, G, or B is &lt;00 or &gt;FF), and the color needs to be remapped so the point is inside of the shape. If I've interpreted correctly, absolute colorimetry means the out-of-range colors are just brought closer to the white point until they're on the edge of the sRGB's &quot;shape&quot;, which means one or more channel is FF.

To the best of my knowledge, Y'IQ hasn't been used since the 1970s due to decoder cost.  And I think you had the in-phase and quadrature-phase components backwards on page 2.  Composite color for Y'IQ should be:<br />C = Q∙sin(ωt + 33°) + I∙cos(ωt + 33°)<br /><br />For Y'UV:<br />C = U∙sin(ωt) + V∙cos(ωt)<br /><br />For Both:<br />ω = 2π∙fsc<br />fsc = 315/88 MHz<br />Colorburst = A∙sin(ωt ± 180°) = -A∙sin(ωt)<br />A = 20 IRE = 142.8mV

The NES merely has particular waveforms that it outputs in response to palette indicies. These consist of either constant amplitude or a square wave of a particular phase between two amplitudes. Game programmers choose indicies based on what colors appear on a TV. They don't choose based on describing the NES circuitry as &quot;thinking&quot; of a particular color in a particular encoding space, outputting the proper phase of wave for it, then the TV decoding the phase and interpreting that as &quot;asking&quot; for a particular color, then converting that to RGB and displaying it.
