E.g. I've played a marimba with very strong 5th harmonics, where if you wanted to focus on it you can listen to that tone instead of the fundamental, and it's completely out of tune with anything else playing with it. In context though, the other sounds guide you to the &quot;correct&quot; hearing of it and the out of tune harmonics are sort of de-emphasized psychologically, just one of the &quot;non-tonal&quot; components to the sound.<br /><br />The noise channel does have the problem that you can't really control which loop you're going to get, but you could probably mitigate that issue just by letting it run in non-periodic mode to continually &quot;randomize&quot; between periodic tones. The majority of tones will establish the 93 step pitch.

Out of the 32767 valid states for the LFSR, 2976 of them have the three-times-as-loud 31st harmonic. I guess that does seem pretty safe.<br /><br />(By which I mean, when the 31st harmonic is present, it's 2.8x or ~9dB louder than any other harmonic component.)

Sounds much like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pG8RAbWs1yo" class="postlink">printer</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xk_XaJ7gE4Q" class="postlink">floppy drive music</a>, and it should, because what B00daw seems to do is start-stop alternate the channel just like the servo of a any such devise would (at least that's my understanding how they work).<br /><br />Yeah, solstice is a great one. Very nice use of (orchestral) triangle. Part of it comes from it being a bit varied in different parts, and part because it is allowed to play solo here and there, i think. <br /><br />That megaman tune (quick man) is a little above my threshold; wouldn't want to listen to that track outside its context. The off-pitch tuning is just too apparent. :S <br /><br />The higher end pitches definitely have a bit of the character the cymbals' bell part. It might sound even better if you have a separate noise channel (Pretty obscure case: Sunsoft 5b) on an external synth chip and use the 93 noise for the bell decay, simultaneously. Harder hits = the drum stick hit closer to the center of the cymbal.<br /><br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">pokun wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">BTW anyone knows some licensed Famicom or NES games that use looped noise?</div><br />Aforementioned Solstice, main <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?annotation_id=annotation_164919&amp;feature=iv&amp;fmt=18&amp;src_vid=iM14dCmYvjI&amp;v=N3YrrUtQ7-g" class="postlink">gameplay</a> theme. I think it sounds off in this NTSC playback, though. It must've been composed for PAL. (warning: subjective random thought. i don't know what tim follin actually thought, of course. but i'd assume they used a PAL unit for testing.) Edit: Ninja'd.

Why would anyone EQ a song, especially by so much, before uploading?  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_cry.gif" alt=":cry:" title="Crying or Very sad" /> <br /><br />Added this in an edit, but then you posted. Pasting the relevant piece here instead:<br /><br />found a quote. &quot;[...] if i typed in '42, 100', '42' would be the note and '100' would be the duration in cycles per second (in the uk, 25 would be one second). So I never knew what key or tempo I was writing in [...]&quot;. If it's about the same period, PAL seems to be the target platform, but tempo not an active decision.

(Also, several screens of the game have garbage in the top row of tiles, which is likely to be covered on NTSC but more often visible on PAL, AFAIK.)<br /><br />I'm not sure whether it can be said to primarily target NTSC or PAL. It was developed in England, but released in North America many months before it was in Europe. I think they were pretty savvy about testing on both by that point. (Though on the issue of tempo, I think they just did a &quot;don't care&quot;, and it's slower in the PAL version.)<br /><br />There was also a short making-of promotional video made, where it looks/sounds like Tim's music demo is NTSC: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=894_PNqBkx4" class="postlink">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=894_PNqBkx4</a>
