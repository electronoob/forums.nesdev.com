		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />It didn't help, but the situation was already I think unrecoverable. The word homebrew is used in an extremely broad fashion in numerous contexts. I've seen people apply it to:<br /><br /><ul>Hacks<br />Reproductions<br />Original games<br />Fan games on PC<br /></ul><br />And sometimes people use the word &quot;homebrew&quot; right alongside: &quot;hack&quot; as though it is almost synonymous. There's an air of illegitimacy, underground, or illegality when it is used. Most of the folks using the term are not technical. Some of them may have unspoken assumptions that ANY new game from an old console is necessarily a hack. Or homebrew. Or something. They don't know, they haven't spent more than a few seconds total of actual thought about the meanings of the words because they flat out don't care. Retro game fans just play the games and echo the words others used, and unfortunately the word homebrew, with the exception of the development community, is irrevocably tainted.<br /><br />So in a way I don't necessarily blame folks for wanting to distance themselves from the word. Any original homebrew is also an indie game, so might as well call it an indie game, to help clarify for the masses it is a labor of love somebody spent years making, often with a professional mindset.

This is to be expected, as one way of stating <a href="http://wiki.c2.com/?LaynesLaw" class="postlink">Layne's Law of Debate</a> is that every substantial debate goes through at least some phase as a definition debate.
