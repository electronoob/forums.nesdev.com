To add a second request to anyone reading, myself I was wondering<br />about a schematic for replacing a 16k SRAM with a 64k SRAM. I have<br />some NBA TE carts that would be alot more useful if I could add more<br />ram to them. <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3870">nintendo2600</a> — Wed Feb 19, 2014 5:54 pm</p><hr />
