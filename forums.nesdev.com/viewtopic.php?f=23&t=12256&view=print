		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I'm itching to try to write a Logo interpreter, but first I'd need a way for the user to type in a program. Which video game consoles had a QWERTY keyboard? I can think of only a few:<br /><ul><li>VideoBrain Family Computer </li><li>Odyssey2 </li><li>CreatiVision </li><li>Nintendo Family Computer (DA15 peripheral, for Japan only) </li><li>Dreamcast </li><li>PlayStation 2 (USB) </li><li>Seventh generation and later (USB) </li></ul><br />There was supposed to be a &quot;Workboy&quot; organizer with a keyboard for the original Game Boy. It was previewed in <em>Nintendo Power</em>, but it never reached stores.<br /><br />Was a keyboard ever released for the PC Engine? Or would it have made it too much PC and not enough Engine? Perhaps Hudson and NEC wanted to emphasize the &quot;Turbo&quot; part, and &quot;TurtleGrafx-16&quot; would have undermined that.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />It was more a matter that keyboards on consoles back then really didn't make sense at all (and these days they only make sense with the browser since almost nothing else really supports them).<br /><br />The Saturn had a keyboard with a rather easy protocol, so there's that. On Japan you had proper keyboards, in the US there was just an adapter to turn PS/2 keyboards into Saturn ones (that said, those are probably much easier to get). Given that the Saturn's I/O port is basically Mega Drive's with a different shape (i.e. the same 9 lines are there) I imagine this won't be much of a trouble to adapt to other systems.<br /><br />The Atari 2600 had <a href="http://blog.codinghorror.com/content/images/uploads/2008/04/6a0120a85dcdae970b0120a86dde02970b-pi.jpg" class="postlink">this</a>. Ew. (although I suppose you could grab three or four keypads and use your own labels, then somehow multiplex between them)

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Yeah, mednafen supports the keyboard in emulation. I wanted to make a tracker program for the PCE (on the real hardware) that could use it (that, and a Dungeons of Daggorath port). I was thinking a modern keyboard to PCE keyboard scan code converter. Maybe something akin to an atmel mcu. The PCE already has an official mouse; the two would be great together.

On top of that it shares the same device ID in the ROM header (&quot;K&quot;).<br /><br />EDIT: also found my documentation on the <a href="http://sik.titandemo.de/megadrive/xband-keyboard.txt" class="postlink">keyboard protocol used by XBand (Mega Drive)</a>, which takes PS/2 keyboards through an adapter, but unless you have the adapter it's probably not worth it (getting the Saturn adapter and then rewiring that would be much easier).

PCE games with the proper code can detect the keyboard's signature and map its reading to the keyboard.<br /><br />Emulating it was more or less a matter of emulating the detection protocol, and then using the Tsushin Tool<br /><img src="http://www.chrismcovell.com/TsushinBooster/14.png" alt="Image" /><br />to see what character each button press appeared as.<br /><br />The keyboard was modeled after the PC-8801 keyboard (Thumb Shift standard), so it had special &quot;thumb shift&quot; keys which needed remapping to English (and/or JIS) keyboards.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Actually, in this case it has to do with the fact that the keyboard uses a port that's missing in later models (it uses an 11-pin port if I recall correctly). I thought it was missing on the Mark III too, though. I didn't mention it before because I'm not sure if the pin count would make it feasible to use with the PCE (through an adapter).<br /><br />As for incompatibilities, yeah, there's the firmware thing (Mega Drive doesn't have the firmware but also won't work with Mark I/II stuff due to missing video modes). As for the I/O ports, it <em>should</em> work from Mark III to Master System (not the <em>other</em> way): the issue is that the former has the pin direction hardwired (except for two of them) while the latter allows assigning the direction for all of them.
