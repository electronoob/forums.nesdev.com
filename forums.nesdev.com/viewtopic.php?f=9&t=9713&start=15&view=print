Having another version of the 5b without the expansion sound would be pretty bad practise... why would you want indistinguishable chip variants around?<br /><br />I'd say it's more likely that the 5a has the expansion sound than there is a 5b variant that doesn't. This is a question several people have posed, but nobody seems to have offered an authoritative answer on these forums yet. I wouldn't presume that it does, but it remains an open question. (My money's on no, but I think it's chances are better than there being a different 5b with no sound.)

I mean learning two alphabets of 48 caracters is not too bad, but the fact some of them are alike is really confusing. There is also the mini-tsu characters which should not be pronounced &quot;tsu&quot;, and so on.<br />Also even if you master perfectly kanas, you'll only be able to read text in old video games and kid's stuff because everything else is written with kanjis and you should study dozen of thousands of hours to learn all of them.

The only real way to find out is to convert the cart to gimmick, wire up the audio circuit, plug it in, and see what happens.  Also if anyone has better pictures of or can look at a japanese gimmick! cart pcb for me that would be very helpful.  There's two capacitors at the top of the pcb, I want to know how many ufs and volts they are.<br /><br />These caps:<br /><br /><img src="http://imgboot.com/images/Drakon/gimmickpcbpartssidecaps.jpg" alt="Image" /><br /><br />The gimmick! cart audio circuit is completely reworked except for those caps values and which side of the 100k ohm resistor connects to which pin of the 5b (but there's only two possible spots so trial and error should do the trick).  I'm pretty sure I have the eprom wiring all figured out.  Now I'm just waiting on some eproms and resistors so I can build this thing (ordered them last night so this could take a while).<br /><br />I'm more curious what the difference between the 5a and the fme7 is (the 5b is a bit obvious, it adds audio capability).  I think the theory that the 5a is the earliest version is a good theory, which means the 5a could be identical to either the fme7 or the 5b.  Without someone willing to convert a 5a cart to gimmick and wire up the audio pins we'll never know if the 5a has the audio capability or not.

I guess pin 18 has been voted off the island.  1 uf caps, who'da thunk.  I found this by going into google images and typing in &quot;sunsoft 5b&quot;.  I was hoping to find a better picture of the gimmick pcb, not the entire schematic.  With the limited japanese I can read, I think this schematic says pin 2 is vcc.
