Just write what seems right for the game, otherwise, the game loses stability.<br /><br />Get some advice from a couple of friends to confirm it if you need to.

Do you play keyboards at all? I've been playing piano for a number of years now (about 11), and most of that time improvising. It's a whole secondary hobby to video games/nes dev. Anyway, it might be the best way to learn voice leading cause you focus on the sound of your music rather than pedantic rules.<br /><br />I strove for years to understand the reasons "why" behind voice leading and all those rules, and I believe I understand them pretty well. The ridiculously simple truth behind common practice era harmony is that composers/musicians back then were really fascinated with the sound of thirds and their inversions (so major and minor thirds, major and minor sixths, tenths, etc.). They felt they sounded "sweetest" of all the intervals. Use of dissonances and parallels are treated with care to bring out the sweetness of thirds (and as a consequence, the fullness of triads) as much as possible.  That, for me, is the root cause of all those rules. I am not sure I understand why that isn't mentioned in music theory books, because once you realize it it becomes quite clear. <br /><br />Video game music from what I've heard follows those rules rather loosely. You'll hear lots of parallel fifths for example. There are really no rules in music. If your premise is: "I'm an enlightenment gentleman and I believe in absolute truth even in music and I want to empahsize the sweetness of thirds at all costs!" then yes, follow those rules. If not, you can do anything you want.<br /><br />*edit* not to mention, video game music especially in the 8 bit era almost formed an entire language all its own, which probably violates all the traditional rules all over the place. One thing music theory books fail at miserably is treatment of rhythm. Video game music  in many cases has really creative use of rhythm, more influenced by jazz or rock music than it is by classical.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3735">GradualGames</a> — Sun Aug 14, 2011 9:08 pm</p><hr />

I don't have the most advanced understanding of music theory, but having taken a couple courses and having some experience with 4-part writing, my advise would be to pay more attention to the 'rules' and suggestions regarding chord progressions. <br /><br />A sure way to make sure your song "works" is to give it a solid chord progression. If you break rules of 4 part writing, like including parallel 5ths, etc, but you do it all within a framework of logical progressions (I IV V I, I ii V, etc), you should still have yourself some competent music. <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /> And then you can let your ear worry about the rest and not overly concern yourself with the myriad rules that come with 4-part writing.<br /><br />I think this particularly applies to the NES, because you often have to imply chords or kind of side-step how they work in the traditional sense. So my personal suggestion would be to pay closer attention to chord progressions and perhaps 2-voice counterpoint.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=1096">bucky o'hare</a> — Sat Jul 16, 2011 12:18 pm</p><hr />

I suppose, but I wanted to learn more about general tendencies and a set of general, practical guidelines. Four-part writing seems to be more like a learning how to solve musical crossword puzzles than a practical set of guidelines. You sit down with your puzzle, solve it according to a theorist's guidelines, listen to it, and by virtue of the many, many rules, it doesn't sound bad. I honestly can't imagine any one composing in the way four-part harmony puzzles are solved.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=153">mbrenaman</a> — Wed Jul 06, 2011 4:26 am</p><hr />

I don't know but it would most certainly help to get used to harmony thing with 4 parts even if you plan to only use 3.<br />(You could always use the FDS channel for one more part if you're only releasing NSFs.)<br /><br />I haven't composed any music for a long while (hell I should do that again how I'll forget how to do it) but I'm one of those guys for who less voices is a good thing. I've never managed to compose for many voices personally, but for some other people, it might be the other way around where the more voice there is the better.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=38">Bregalad</a> — Tue Jul 05, 2011 1:25 am</p><hr />
