I was wondering if anyone could create a custom game using custom drawn characters that I would provide.<br /><br />I would like it to be at least one world or enough to play through...not sure on the semantics. I also understand that being a specific custom game for one person would cost more, which I would like to discuss at the start but am willing to pay.<br /><br />Not sure what other information is need, but could/would you or anyone you know be able to create something like this? <br /><br />Fingers Crossed,<br /><br /><img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /> Savvy

If it doesn't matter, what are some of his hobbies or favorite NES games? How long (in minutes of play) do you want or need it to be? Is this meant solely for him, or do you plan to sell/distribute this somehow? Is music needed? I assume you want a physical cartridge, not just a rom? Is there a world associated with the characters to help make the level graphics? Is there  a hard deadline for all of it? Before an anniversary or something?<br /><br />I could likely make sprites of the characters, and have them walking around in a couple of days. I'm capable of world graphics as well, but would hope there's some kind of reference for that to go with the characters. How long the rest of the game would take/how much it might be would depends some answers to the above questions. I'd say expect absolute bare minimum of $250 for something really quick/short, though. And music (at least good music, heh) is outside my skillset.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I want this to be as nice as possible. I have more than a years time limit-I wanted to do this early to give plenty of time for it to be done well. This will be exclusively for our own personal collection. Preferably on a cartridge. It would be great if the rom was included. I would like music, even though it doesn't have to be anything special. <br />My husband is a gamer through and through and plays titles from Intellevision to Xbox 1. Some of his all time favorites are Zelda, Final Fantasy, Sonic, Mega Man, and one we like to do together, Mario.<br />Any game would be great, one based off of one of these even better.<br />The characters I would like used are the furies he draws him and I as-him as a humanoid cat and me as a humanoid bunny. There is not much background on these characters other than that they are married. Stage setting doesn't really matter much as long as they are both used, wither in a party like Final Fantasy or maybe two player or like mario-humanoid cat and peach-the humanoid bunny. <br />$250 is very reasonable, I do not mind paying more for a more complete and in-depth game.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />A romhack is probably a better idea.<br /><br /><br />Creating 1 world of a quality game is almost as challenging as creating 8 worlds of a quality game. There is so much overhead before you can get to the point where you can make the first finished looking level in a game. Don't think you are saving lots of work by asking for only 1 world, it does not reduce the scope as significantly as that sounds.<br /><br />Even a game as simple as Super Mario Bros. you must consider was the work of several talented people over the course of at least a year. Consider what it would cost to pay 5 people even minimum wage for a year.<br /><br /><br />That said, there are lots of people who are willing to do quite a lot for free, and some people may have some ready-made things available to throw something together more quickly, and we do indeed have better development tools than in the past. Making games, though, is difficult work, and there's probably a triangle here of TIME vs COST vs QUALITY that will limit what you can get.<br /><br />It's difficult to get one-off non-commercial projects like this done, usually because the cost or time involved isn't worth it. People who will work for free, or for very low cost, probably won't be able to stick with it long enough unless they are passionate about the project. The game you're proposing would be played by only two people, so, honestly this would be a very strange thing for someone besides to be passionate about.<br /><br /><br />I'd offer to do it for a fair price (if you told me your budget, I could estimate the scope of the kind of game you'd get), but I'll be occupied by my own game project for the next few months. I expect it will be difficult, even with cash in hand, to find someone who  is capable and available.<br /><br />A hack of an existing game, though, would be lightyears easier to accomplish, and there are many people here who could do it. (I could find the time to do it, myself. It's much quicker than creating a new game.)
