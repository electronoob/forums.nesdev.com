I first learned about it from this thread: <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/viewtopic.php?f=21&amp;t=6004" class="postlink">http://forums.nesdev.com/viewtopic.php?f=21&amp;t=6004</a> but the only details remaining there some vague praise, a few mockups and a broken youtube link. After a few days of ~internet sleuthing~ I learned about the hack, and found and contacted optomon, who emailed me these images. They are posted here with his permission. Thaddeus took down all his accounts and disappeared from the internet.<br /><br />These images are inspirational for me. I love how silhouettes are used to suggest depth, how colors bring out details like the rust on the walkways in the clock tower, and the amount of detail packed into cleverly re-used tiles like in the machinery, arches, stonework and Victorian buildings. Hope you guys like it too. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />

Then let me tell you about how I managed to find some videos posted by a guy making music for the hack that had badly upscaled screenshots as the background to his videos. And let me tell you about how I saved them anyway because they were that good.

(Besides the dude who made them of course.) I've always wanted 1:1 pixel versions of the art from this hack, but I hate contacting people out of the blue. The fact that you did it and got results everyone's willing to share is awesome. Seriously, thanks so much!

Right now I'm working to preserve another project where the only remaining images are in old youtube videos. Touching them up by hand in photoshop is time-consuming and not always successful.

I never noticed it until someone mentioned it, but NES games seem to use a LOT of black, most likely to compensate for the 16*16 attribute limitation.  These graphics make the limitations much more obvious, unfortunately.<br /><br />I'm not knocking on anyone's talents, though, this looks really good.  I like the use of colors, though some areas are overpowered by the black.

Other parts, on the other hand, like the grass and the rocks, appear to have many more colors than the NES usually allows.<br /><br />Yes, black was used extensively in these graphics to blend the different palettes together, but since Castlevania is a dark game the black fits in really well. The same technique couldn't be used as extensively in a happy cute bright colors platformer.

Neon green is a good color, as is white.  Contrasting dark colors with brighter ones will trick the brain into thinking there's more color there.  Sometimes, effective color use is more important than sheer color number; Kirby's Adventure, while colorful, can have pretty monochromatic colors at times, and it doesn't help that most palettes are simply variants of &quot;darker color/color/brighter color&quot;.  Some stages which are predominantly one palette such as <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.nintendoworldreport.com/media/19281/1/1.jpg">http://www.nintendoworldreport.com/media/19281/1/1.jpg</a><!-- m --> look quite... bad.
