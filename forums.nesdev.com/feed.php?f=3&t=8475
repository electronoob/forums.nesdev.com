JIT techniques could help a great deal with the CPU speed, but the PPU is a difficult problem to tackle, especially if you are aiming any kind of honorable level of accuracy.<br /><br />VGA can do smooth 4-way scrolling, but the addresses only wrap at segment boundary if I recall correctly, meaning that if you scroll the screen 20 pixels to the left, what you get in the right edge of the screen is the 20 pixels of <em>1 scanline below</em>. I may be mistaken at this, though.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=5043">Bisqwit</a> — Fri Dec 30, 2011 4:25 pm</p><hr />

A SNES w/ SA-1 could probably emulate the NES pretty well, but I doubt at full speed.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=20">kyuusaku</a> — Fri Dec 30, 2011 1:22 pm</p><hr />

I programmed a second NES emulator to try to achieve reasonable performance on my Pentium 233mhz laptop. I wasn't doing any assembly programming though. It was still all C++ but I optimized graphics rendering and emulation enough to get 60fps performance out of it even with Blargg's APU emulation for sound. <br /><br />I'm not sure if you could out perform Nesticle. I have a feeling it's heavily optimized for speed given its age and reputation. I never used LoopyNES much but it also was quite fast and I recall didn't have problems with various games like Ninja Gaiden 3 which Nesticle has issues with scrolling. <br /><br />As GBA was mentioned, I wonder if the Sharp X68000 could emulate NES fairly well since I believe it has console graphics capability but can have a 68000 cpu clocked reasonably high with plenty of memory. Not having to do software graphics emulation certainly helps reduce resources needed.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=1726">MottZilla</a> — Fri Dec 30, 2011 12:38 pm</p><hr />

i've been thinking about doing a secondary emulator for DOS as kind of a side project to my main one. i am wondering just how fast one could get. do you think it's possible to get much faster than NESticle? i was going to do it in 100% assembly, i'm working on the 6502 code right now.<br /><br />any tips? i'm not aiming for accuracy, just pure speed. as long as it could play a fair amount of games properly, i'd be happy. i've got an old 25 MHz 486 laptop, think it's feasible to aim for full speed on that?<br /><br />the PPU, of course, is going to be the tricky part. one thought i had was keep the whole 512x480 background rendered in memory (just the lower two bits of the pixel, since lots of games change attributes for background animation), only making small incremental changes when nametable blocks are changed. then i can just copy ready-to-go memory blocks for each scanline from the proper parts of the background, OR in the attribute bits, and write it to the PC's video RAM.<br /><br />do you think the goal of full speed on 25 MHz is impossible?<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=4572">miker00lz</a> — Thu Dec 29, 2011 8:37 pm</p><hr />
