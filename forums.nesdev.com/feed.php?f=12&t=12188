I know I ought to document this stuff more officially, as I've been schooled, but not yet.. Thus: <br /><br /><br />The issue was with songs that change the volume registers quickly -- this is what causes the discontinuity in the waveform and therefore the click.. Blargg compensated by developing an optional feature SMOOTH_DSP, which if defined in a preprocessor definition, would somehow smoothen out the volume transitions (don't ask me for details on how he actually does it, but I'd like to know as well <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />  -- it is a private change that he asked me to take my time using it to see how it sounds.. I love it!! &lt;3 I must have listened to 500+ of SPC with it by now.. Albeit the same hundreds (Mariokart, Star Fox, Super Metroid, Seiken Densetsu, Super Mario RPG, Kirby's Dream Course, Super Scope, Yoshi's Island, Super Mario World, and some others). <br /><br />The change is present in SNES Tracker github but I doubt anyone can find it <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" /> <br />If you do more power to you.<br /><br />K<br /><br />An official update to his APU is contingent on my approval, which I gave him in a recent email. ---&gt; Note, right now Blargg is kind of a mess when it comes to this APU &lt;--- but I have the following hope that he might identify which of his many code bases is the latest and greatest APU emulator, and then upload that to a Github repo. We'll see what he does, or doesn't do :{<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=4992">bazz</a> — Tue Feb 10, 2015 7:22 pm</p><hr />

Dammit, why didn't I think of an FFT analysis?  That's why we &lt;3 you lidnariq.  :-)  Yes, the latest file (spc_issue_solo.spc) contains the same problem.  And I think what's shown on the left is what I'm hearing as well / what bazz is reporting.<br /><br />Just for benefit: to see what lidnariq indicated in his screenshot, use Audacity to load up one of the wav files.  Once its loaded, on the far left of the waveform, near the filename, click the down-arrow and choose Spectrogram.  You can adjust some of the spectrogram behaviours under Edit / Preferences / Spectrograms.  I'd suggest increasing the max freq to 20kHz as well -- the top of the click seems to cap off at about 13~15kHz.<br /><br />And those definitely correlate with the clicks I hear.  Although when zooming in to look at the actual waveform itself, I really don't see any reason for the cause.<br /><br />One thing to note: the clicks seem to come in pairs if you look at the spectrograms.  There's a large one, almost always immediately followed by a smaller one roughly half its size.  I find that interesting.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3">koitsu</a> — Wed Dec 31, 2014 7:00 pm</p><hr />

The clicks are most definitely present in my last post lidnariq, that's precisely why I posted it, to point out the solo'd voice responsible, or at least apparently most responsible,, This happens on other tracks too.. like the &quot;Brinstar Red Soil Swamp&quot; (GREAT SONG). Note: There are tracks where it is unnoticed or nonexistent, but I have tasted the fruit of smoothness via SPCPlay / youtube renders and I want to obtain it in my tracker. Read more: Good news, Blargg is on the scene, I think. I just got a response from him. He's curious as to whether this is accurate emulation or not. But I told him, even if it IS accurately doing thing, that I would love to have an option to opt out of it! I want clean music, not that garble.. and when other SPC players are playing it nicely I know it can be done. and I know the APU emulation is causing it. I'm not an APU master, but I'm close. Tahahaha!! HAHAH! But, I told Blargg I'm willing to convert his good instructions into work if he knows how to solve it. We'll see what he says, he might end up solving it himself. I might be speaking too soon. Who knows..<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=4992">bazz</a> — Wed Dec 31, 2014 6:59 pm</p><hr />

Okay, I see what you're talking about now (for those reading/trying: turn your volume up a bit, it becomes quite noticeable then, but is easily missed at lower volumes).<br /><br />I hope lidnariq comments here, because I'm not sure how to exactly explain what I think the issue is.  IMPORTANT: I am *not* an audio guy.<br /><br />To me, it looks like either over-amplification that results in clipping (of the generated waveform), or something wrong with the waveform generation for specific samples.  The thing that seems to be causing the noise is the &quot;bass&quot; noise being used, or possibly that *combined* with the background &quot;rain&quot;, but I think it's the former.  It looks to me like some of the &quot;bass&quot; samples are very aggressively shooting up and down in their waveforms in such a way that doesn't seem... smooth.  I can try to upload a screenshot with areas circled if I'm not being clear.<br /><br />Although this gets me wondering... SNES samples loop automatically on playback, right?  I remember when doing music tracking on the PC, that looped samples tended to have &quot;clicks&quot; or &quot;blips&quot; if the end of the waveform didn't match the start; you'd get a &quot;popping&quot; noise that was very short and could sound &quot;high-frequency&quot; in some cases.  Maybe that's what's happening here?<br /><br />It would help if we could single out just a single sample (e.g. the &quot;bass&quot; noise by itself) and see if that's where the issue is, or if it's only present if there is something else being mixed with it (e.g. the &quot;rain&quot;).  Looking at the results in Audacity is hard because of the intermixed &quot;rain&quot; -- hard to do reliable waveform analysis that way.<br /><br />I'll see if I can find one of the SPC players I've used in the past which can let you mute tracks or play and extract individual samples/instruments.<br /><br />P.S. -- Have you tried contacting blargg directly (not here on the forum), i.e. via Email?  His Email address is in the upper right of his web pages under Contact.<br /><br />Edit: JCOM-SPC let me toggle individual channels.  The &quot;bass&quot; noise is on the 2nd channel, while the &quot;rain&quot; is on the 3rd channel.  Mute out all the channels except for the 2nd and you'll get what I think is most relevant.  I still can't find the SPC player thing I've used in the past which gave me a surprisingly large amount of control over all the samples.  Grrr...<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3">koitsu</a> — Wed Dec 31, 2014 6:27 pm</p><hr />

I don't really hear what it is you're referring to (and I have amazingly good hearing (tradeoff for having crappy eyesight), especially to high-frequency noises), at least in the mp3 you linked.<br /><br />There are a couple spots at the end of lightning/thunder that have a brief/soft pop, but other than that I don't really hear what it is you're talking about.<br /><br />Have you tried listening to the actual SPC/RSN rips in an SPC emulator like Alpha-II SPC Player or similar?  I can provide what that sounds like if you want (I tend to use settings that use Sinc interpolation, not Gaussian like the actual SNES, because I think Gaussian sounds like muffled crap).<br /><br />Can you snip out the portion(s) that depict the issue using, say, Audacity and then provide them here / links to them (preferably in .wav, since the source material you linked is MP3, so MP3 -&gt; MP3 is going to just add more compression/sound worse)?<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3">koitsu</a> — Wed Dec 31, 2014 1:46 pm</p><hr />
