I remember Pasofami files, also wasn't there even .DKA and .DKB files for FDS emulation?  That was a long time ago, but IIRC it was a shareware program in Japanese with limits in the trial version.  Around here, that's about as obscure as it can get.  I never tried it myself, but then again I never tried iNES either because I was using DOS/Win3.11 up until 2000. <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" /><p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=10">Memblers</a> — Sun Jan 25, 2009 12:22 pm</p><hr />

Or because it was the first and -- still is -- most prominently used file format for NES/FC games.<br /><br />I'm somewhat surprised that a community full of technically-savvy individuals haven't realised the sad reality of technology: what comes first is what usually wins.  Look at how long it's taken to get rid of the ISA bus from x86 PCs (we still haven't fully gotten rid of it, by the way).  We're still using ZIP archives, floppy drives (not entirely on the way out due to complexities involving booting from USB pen/flash drives), and (especially in this arena) parallel ports.<br /><br />So Nintendo uses the iNES file format.  So what?  There is no license, AFAIK, on that file format.  More importantly, has anyone actually spoken to Marat Fayzullin to see if he's received any contact from Nintendo with regards to use of his file format in the Wii?  I'm willing to bet not a single one of you has taken the time to do that (it would have been the first thing I'd done).  Seriously guys, ease up.  :-)<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3">koitsu</a> — Sat Jan 24, 2009 10:40 pm</p><hr />

I'm guessing Nintendo used the iNES header because 1. it had already been used in licensed titles based on the PocketNES engine, and 2. it happens to be a well-documented way to specify in general terms what PCBs a game is capable of running on. And I seem to remember that Sega hid even bigger nods in one of its classics compilation for the Dreamcast (or was it the Saturn?).<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=9">tepples</a> — Sat Jan 24, 2009 2:14 pm</p><hr />

Homebrew/emulation/piracy falls under the same umbrella IMO. They all feed off each other, despite ideological differences. I expect Nintendo feels the same way.  I suppose some distinction can be made for "antique" systems but it's splitting hairs. At some point it isn't worth pursuing, and they turn a blind eye to it instead.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=4">loopy</a> — Wed Jan 21, 2009 10:43 pm</p><hr />
