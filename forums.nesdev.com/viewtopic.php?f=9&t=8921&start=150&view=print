<br />
<br />Linear memory model predates use of bankswitched memory in 8-bit computers. It is only seems 'crazy' for people who get used to the NES design too much, I think.
<br />
<br />I don't think there are too many NROM homebrews that use save RAM, so this problem does not seem too large. Also, no one forces to use the mapper if someone needs save RAM, or more ROM, or anything else. It does not replace anything.

<br />That alone should serve as an indication of how crazy this whole idea is, don't you think?
<br />
<br />I still barely see the point in this extension, but I'm not against you trying to make it work. If someone does find that a slightly expanded NROM is better for their project than the most common/simple mappers, great for them.
<br />
<br />I will problably never use it though, because I really don't like the CHR-ROM constraints of NROM. Even for really small projects I'd rather go with UNROM.
<br />
<br />Like it's been said, nobody is forcing anyone to use specific boards on their projects, so the existence this extension isn't a problem at all. Don't like it, don't use it, like tons of weird mappers out there.

<br />The programmer solution is fixing CC65. While this is not <em>hard</em> it <em>is</em> a huge time sink, and since no one has mentioned that they're now investing effort into fixing CC65, I just don't understand the nay-sayers.**
<br />
<br />It's not even like one'd need to do this the really hard way with the aforementioned call graph: you could implement something like Borland Turbo C++'s Medium (bankswitched code, no bankswitched data, one trampoline in fixed bank, all calls involve bankswitch) or Compact (bankswitched data, no bankswitched code, all data fetches involve bankswitch) memory models.
<br />
<br />But I'm not volunteering, and until one of you do, I'm going to stick by the EE solution.

<br />I am fine with 46kB linear memory.

It does currently say that NROM-368 can be used for <em>all mappers incapable of banking PRG, such as discrete logic mappers 0 (NROM), 3 (CNROM), 13 (CPROM), 99 (Vs. System), and 184 (Sunsoft 1)</em>.<br /><br />For mapper 99, that's wrong. VS Gumshoe uses Mapper 99 for accessing 40K PRG-ROM (rounded up to 48K in iNES images). The game shares 4016h.bit2 for both selecting a 8K CHR-ROM bank, and simultaneously selecting a 8K PRG-ROM bank.<br /><br />I'll remove Mapper 99 from list of the NROM-368 compatible mappers (on the wiki).<br />If there are other NROM-368 docs elsewhere, please fix them, too.<br />If anybody has already made a NROM-368 game for the VS system, please add some warnings about the problem (to the wiki, and to this thread, and to whom else you might want to warn).

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />lidnariq: It's true that CC65 has no built in support for bankswitching, but it's not true that you can't do it without modifying CC65 itself.<br /><br />- The easiest way by far is to only place your C code in a single bank, and use the other banks only for data and assembly code. (The simplest way to do this is with AxROM/BNROM and no DPCM samples. This gives you a full 32k to devote entirely to C code, and up to 224k for other things too! It's also a &quot;one chip&quot; mapper, no more complicated than the 48k NROM.)<br /><br />- If you need C code in more than one bank, you can manage a small trampoline in assembly to transition between the banks. Each bank should be linked separately and combined at the end. You will need to link the CRT into both banks, and also remember to reserve enough RAM area for each bank's static variables (this can be policed fairly easily by the linker config for each bank). Also, make sure your startup code does the initialization for all the banks that need it.<br /><br />Maybe it's true that this is too advanced for someone who wants to only write in C, but it really doesn't require rewriting/modifying the compiler to accomplish! The only thing that would require doing that is if you want transparent native bankswitching in C. If you're willing to organize your code and write a little bit of assembly, it's quite doable.<br /><br /><br />This said, I'm not offering this as a counter-argument to oversize NROM, which I think is fine. I just wanted to respond to the idea that bankswitching is somehow unfeasible in CC65.
