I also know they butchered the hell out of it for no adequately-explained reason - everything I listed is a problem I actually had, that disappeared when I switched to Debian. (The audio issues were actually fixed by removing PulseAudio, but Ubuntu wouldn't let me do that and Debian does.)<br /><br />And that's not even including out-of-date and buggy libraries breaking my builds, making my code run at 0.2 FPS and wasting hours of my time searching for bugs that weren't my fault. When your unstable, bleeding-edge packages - which are nonetheless labelled 'stable' - are two years behind <em>Debian</em> of all distros, you're doing something wrong. (No I am not making that up - that was the state of SDL in Ubuntu in 2014. It was the straw that broke my camel's back.)<br /><br />YMMV, obviously, but I've now been using Debian for about as long as I was using Ubuntu, and for me the difference has been night and day. If you don't want to play or develop games and don't like diving into the terminal every five minutes, I imagine it would be much smoother sailing. And hey, maybe they've fixed all the issues I was having by now - but given the attitude of the staff, I somehow doubt that.
