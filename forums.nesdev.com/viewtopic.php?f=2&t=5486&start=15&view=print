<br />It might have been an artistic decision. When I was designing a NES raycaster, I pixelated the hand on purpose so that it wouldn't look so different from the low resolution background. Even the original Wolfenstein 3D does this. It's just so that the different types of graphics blend well together.

<br />You can see the 8x8 tiles pretty clearly when you get up close to a wall, but from a distance its very impressive. Adding objects with perspectives would be a challenge though, because you'd need a different set of 8x8, 16x16, 32x32 tiles for each distance, which would pretty much eat up all your sprite resources.

Then you wouldn't have to worry about doing CHR data transfers and you could just do NT updates. That might be more beneficial for when you have to scale complex objects, simply because it's easier to deal with only NT updates and not CHR updates. It would greatly reduce resolution, however.

<br />Then again, what would be the point of having more resolution if that would make the game dead slow? Casting the rays is already kinda slow, scaling the textures is quite slow too. With too much resolution not only will you have to do those steps with many columns more, you'll also spend too much time drawing patterns and updating them.
<br />
<br />Also, using CHR-RAM would force you to reduce the viewport because of the limited number of tiles, IMO killing the point of having better resolution.
<br />
<br />I believe that a CHR-ROM-based raycaster should be quite playable on the NES. Something like Celius said (which would look similar to <a href="http://www.nesstuff.kit.net/nesray10.jpg" class="postlink">this demo</a> - download and change the extension to ZIP) could work, but the low vertical resolution bothers me a bit. I prefer to have more vertical resolution and less horizontal resolution, which even reduces the number of calculations to perform, and it could look like what I posted in <a href="http://nesdev.com/bbs/viewtopic.php?p=23620#23620" class="postlink">this thread</a>. This is my favorite option, I must say.
<br />
<br />Another option that also works with CHR-ROM is something that looks like <a href="http://www.nesstuff.kit.net/nesray14.jpg" class="postlink">this demo</a> (again, change the extension to ZIP). The resolution is better, but there are no textures and there are only two colors for walls.
<br />
<br />There are several ways a raycaster could be made on the NES using CHR-ROM, and some of them don't even need all 256 tiles. With my favorite way I managed to leave 80 free tiles, enough for borders and a decent interface, and the other half of the pattern table is 100% free for sprites.

<br />You are right, you could make use of 256 tiles of 2x8 "textels" instead of 4x4, or use regular nametable changes to increase the resolution. I wrote once a demo that does that and my it was so much of a pain, I had code that does linear transformation *and* timed $2000 writes at the same time. Would definitely be better with an MMC3.

<br />Not really. If CHR-ROM is used, only the name table will have to be updated. Since the game cannot run at 60 fps anyway because of all the calculations needed for walls and objects, the data doesn't need to be dumped to the PPU all at once either.
<br />
<br />Say, if the game runs at 15 fps, the display will only change every 4 hardware frames, so we have 4 VBlanks to update the hidden name table. That's enough to redraw a very big portion of it, certainly enough for the 3D view and the HUD.
<br />
<br />As I see it, the only advantage of PAL hardware is the extended VBlank, which, according to the explanation above, isn't really necessary. Castle NESsenstein probably needed PAL because it's logic is faster (seeing as there are no objects, textures or even fisheye lens correction) and draws the whole name table at once.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Perhaps it might look stupid, but it's possible to have increased vertical resolution for the raycasting part and use 4x4 pixels on the sprite half of the pattern table. But once an enemy gets really close up, they would probably take the entire sprite page to be drawn, so maybe it's a good idea to use the BG for enemies and use all 4x4 pixels. Though I still have a feeling it would work/look pretty cool to have CHR RAM and use really minimal 3D calculation to draw the walls as wireframe models and fill them with XOR filling. I totally think you could do it and have it run at 12 FPS. That way you can have perfect horizontal and vertical resolution.

<br />
<br />I KNOW the NES can display some crazy stuff, but there is no way it can display perfect resolution ray casting at 30 or 60 fps.
<br />That's the first thing I noticed that had to mean it was fake.
<br />
<br />The second thing is what some others said. The sprites. The NES has a sprite limit, and it's not possible to stretch sprite images, though it may be possible to stretch an image and the render it as sprites? I donno I suck at this stuff but I know enough of it to know what's real and what isn't.
<br />It can't be part of the background either because it would be displaying more than 4 colors on 1 tile.

<br />Now imagine a microcontroller on the Game Pak rendering textured polygons into a frame buffer. For each 8x1 pixel sliver, it reads the pixels from the frame buffer, decides which of four palettes would best represent that sliver, and sends the palette ID and eight pixels. Done poorly, the attribute clash would look like the ZX Spectrum. Done well, it could look better than the MSX.

<br />Anyways he's still alive.
<br />I asked him in a PM why he's doing all this. Trying to get attention from people through some crappy edit of a Game Maker example.
<br />
<br />I really, really. think it was done throughout this DOOM Game Maker example findable on the site. Same physics and aspects and all.
