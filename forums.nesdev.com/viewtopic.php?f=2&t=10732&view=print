		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />My game supports four players and I just added a really basic menu so that I can have players join and leave instead of me having to reassemble the game to change the number of players.  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_surprised.gif" alt=":o" title="Surprised" /> <br /><br />Right now, I just read $4016 8 times for player 1, then another 8 times for player 3. I read $4017 8 times for player 2, then another 8 times for player 4.<br /><br />I don't check for the four score signature or anything like that. This works on a real NES with both official standard controllers and the NES advantage whether the four score is attached or not, whether all controllers are attached or none are or anything in between. <br /><br />Lots of emulators seem to not like this, and behave as if player 3 and 4 are holding all the buttons down when the four score isn't set as attached.<br /><br />So, reading the wiki, I'm gathering that certain controllers return 1 rather than 0 past the first 8 reads. So basically, I need to read $4016/$4017 8 more times, than zero player 3/player 4's controller is the result is $FF? Would I need to specifically check for $10 and $20 (four score signature), or is the $FF itself a big enough hint?<br /><br />Could I get away with zeroing any controller who ends up with a value of $FF for its 8 reads instead of doing an additional 8 reads for the $FF/signature, or would that break some hypothetical behavior in some controllers/emulators?<br /><br />Is there anything else I need to be aware of when supporting four players? (I'm not using DMC!) I'm asking all this because I'm bummed I have to do more stuff to make emulators happy, and for all I know some actual controllers people might be using might have behavior different than the ones I own and I can't test that and don't want to hope I'm understanding the wiki correctly.

So I have no idea why yours is giving you different results...</div><br />Okay, you both made me double check, and now I feel crazy because it's doing exactly that. I guess it's good to know I'm not doing extra work just for emulators. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_confused.gif" alt=":?" title="Confused" /> I swear I just tried it before I made the post, and got a different thing. I uh... wouldn't have made the post at all otherwise. (&quot;Broken on NES, must fix!&quot; rather than &quot;Broken on emulators eh...&quot;) I'm NTSC. <br /><br />If $FF to $00 will work with a four score or without on an American NES/emulators without weird options set, it sounds good at least for now. I already set left+right to neither left nor right and up+down to neither up nor down, but I figure a keyboard user might notice if I drop ALL input in those cases, rather than just the directions in question. It'd be rare, but I don't want change direction+jump with A to possibly ignore the jump. (Yes, yes, keyboard ghosting exists too. That's not a problem for me to solve.)<br /><div class="quotetitle">The Standard Controller Talk Page wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">After the first eight bits, the Super NES controller returns A, X, L, R, four zero bits, then all 1</div><br />So if I'm understanding correctly from the talk page on the wiki, an SNES controller connected to an NES is (8 buttons), (4 buttons, 4 zeroes), then 1s. I'm not sure how terribly much I care about R/L etc giving input to players 3 and 4 since it's not like they'll be non zero if the person wasn't pressing them. <br /><div class="quotetitle">Tepples wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">famiclones allowing play of Super NES games with an NES will return 00000001 after the 8 main buttons.</div><br />That's lousy... So an SNES controller on a famiclone might be (8 buttons), (7 zeroes, a 1), (Then what?). I'm very close to not caring about clones with SNES controllers. Depends on what happens for &quot;Then what?&quot;.<br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">(You might also consider adding support for the Famicom multitap.)</div><br />I already sort of support it for one to two players. (Player 3 also controls Player 1, Player 4 also controls Player 2).<br /><br />For four player it's as easy as:<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">lda $4016<br />ror<br />rol p1buttons<br />ror<br />rol p3buttons<br /></div><br />Right?<br /><br />Ay, so I guess at some point I just need to make another menu that lets the person choose the input type. <br /><br />Four Score style ($FF controllers to $00, player 3 controls player 1 on famicom) would be the default.<br />Famicom Multitap (Code above, maybe $FF controllers to $00 for consistency)<br />SNES (would just read the first 8 bytes of both controllers, or possibly use those buttons for something... I had considered supporting the extra buttons for the hell of it anyway)<br /><br />Let's say only Players 1/2 can control the menus. (I hate to do that, but it ignores the one stupid case of a famiclone's player 3 right key constantly held down provided the &quot;Then what?&quot; answer isn't favorable.) <br /><br />With the above plan, is there is no way for undesired input to happen (other than SNES controllers doing stuff if they press the extra buttons in Four Score Mode), and no way get stuck? That is, you have the option set one way, and try to play the game on different setup that will interfere with you changing the options.<br /><br />Getting into super hypothetical territory, is there an already existing way to support 4 SNES controllers? Doesn't seem like a thing that you could do with the fourscore, but maybe the famicom multitap? I know nothing of hardware, but I guess if I'm supporting every other setup under the sun I may as well see if this possible.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">Tepples wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">Or you could use two controller read routines:</div><br />At this point it's looking like I need at least 3...

(The first bit for a definitely player 1 byte, the next bit for a maybe player 3 byte.) <br />2. Read 8 more times, shift the lowest bit into a new separate byte of RAM.<br />3. Read 8 more times, if four score signature is found, the last byte created is player 3's, else the maybe player 3 byte becomes player 3.<br />(Same thing for players two and 4)<br /><br />Detect a press of A button to sign a player in. (Actually, doesn't the above ensure all players can even navigate all the menus? Weird stuff like SNES extra buttons/famiclone SNES holding right would get killed by failing the Four Score signature check, right?)<br /><br />I'd still need a code or something if I want to support SNES controllers for the regular 1 or 2 player campaign, but are there issues with the above that I'm not seeing? Seems like it'd work with SNES controllers (famiclone and not), NES controllers (four score and not), Famicom controllers (multitap and not) which is pretty much all the scenarios that aren't crazy.<br /><br />Also, thanks everyone!
