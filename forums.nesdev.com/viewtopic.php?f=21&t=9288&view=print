Technically, you can make sprites with more than 3 colors by stacking sprites, but when your frames are 25 pixels wide that means using nearly all of the 8 sprites that are allowed to be displayed per scanline just on your main character, leaving nothing for enemies, items and so on.<br /><br />I'm not too fond of the Mega Man sprites. They were OK for the first game, but then everything else improved with each game while Mega Man remained the same and started to look very dated. He's too flat (because of the lack of shadows and highlights), not very detailed (blobs of blue and cyan form the body), and some animation frames put him in rather weird/distorted positions (giant hand when throwing things, weird legs when getting hurt, etc.). Personally, I wouldn't use him as inspiration for my own sprites.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />If you intend to put these sprites on a real NES game, you have a bit to learn about how NES graphics work.<br /><br />Sprites are made from 8x8 pixel blocks with a palette of 3 colours. You can have four 3-colour palettes in use at one time. Keep in mind that all sprites on screen need to use these palettes, so it's not usually a good idea to use them all up on your character. If you need to have extra colours on your character, keep the area that uses the second palette group to a minimum. Notice that Mega Man is 3-colours except for his face, which fits neatly inside two 8x8 blocks (his arms are still blue for a reason). His shot uses the same palette as his face. The other two palettes belong to whatever enemies are in the current scene.<br /><br />Also, don't use your background colour as a hair highlight. The background will show through this, unless your character is always against a white background. You can use a white pixel instead of the background colour, but this is probably a waste of a sprite and palette space.<br /><br />Another rule that may be important is that taller is preferred to wider on the NES. You can only have 8 sprites on any given horizontal line, or else you have to do something like flickering them on and off to make sure all of them show up at least part of the time.<br /><br />Also make sure things fit neatly into 8x8 blocks. For instance don't make something 25 pixels wide when it could be 24 (8x3). The 8x8 blocks also don't need to be on a grid. Note how the tank in Blaster Master has a separate body and wheels, letting the wheels roll and stretch out without requiring extra frames of body animation. <br /><br />A lot of games will use separate sprites with their own palette if the character is using a weapon. For example look at the turtles in TMNT; each of them is only 3 colours, but the weapon is animated separately and has its own palette.<br /><br />There are probably other nuances, but this is a start.

Look at Super Mario Bros. 3: the overalls are actually black, and the gloves are skin color. Another pattern is seen in Contra: head and shirt with one palette, pants with another, both palettes reused elsewhere on the screen.
