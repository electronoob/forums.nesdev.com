I've seen MODs that had several looped songs and different sound effects are all in the same file (using loop and jump commands).  I'm not exactly sure how that would be implemented in the code, though.  Probably would need modification to the player of some sort.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=10">Memblers</a> — Sat Sep 25, 2010 12:54 am</p><hr />

Yeah, you'd have to learn the hardware, but I'm not sure what parts you would <em>have</em> to code in assembly (the interrupts maybe?).  regblah = 0 should translate to LDA #0 / STA regblah, just as useless if you aren't 100% sure what 'regblah' is, heheh.<br /><br />You sure about the amount of CPU power you need, too?  I mean, even with how slow the NES is (SNES is almost twice as fast) the main limitation to run into is the amount of PPU data to transfer during vblank.  SNES has DMA, so that has ceased to be a problem.<br /><br />Thanks for uploading that, I've been really curious to see it, but wasn't sure how to get started.  If you think you might want to maintain a windows build of that, and need an ftp account for storage, I could give you one.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=10">Memblers</a> — Thu Sep 23, 2010 3:12 pm</p><hr />

Of course it gets easier with the SDK as I can write C code. I also already had a small platforming engine running last time I tried it. But as I am used to programming on a PC where you have nearly unlimited power compared to the SNES it is quite difficult. It's interesting nonetheless <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br />The most difficult part however is that for some things you HAVE to use assembly... which is another hurdle.<br />Maybe you're right and programming on the SNES is as difficult as on other platforms, however I'm used to using libraries which simplify things.

Why is it high? I don't see any huge reason why it'd be that much harder than other platforms.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=1726">MottZilla</a> — Thu Sep 23, 2010 9:56 am</p><hr />
