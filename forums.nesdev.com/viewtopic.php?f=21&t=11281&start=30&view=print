To input that into the palette generator, click on &quot;get current preset&quot; and put that coordinate in for Wx and Wy. For you, it might look better or might look worse, this is just what worked best for me.<br /><br />If you're using a CRT TV with your emulator, I'm not sure what to recommend, because I haven't tested that. I guess it comes down to how warm or cool the grays are.

Are you just treating color 0x0E as black and colors 0x20 and colors 0x30 as white?</li><li>Are you using the color burst amplitude as an amplitude reference for the chroma signals?</li><li>What does a hue of -0.25 actually mean? How many degrees is that? I notice that 360 degrees (meaning no change) is at about 31.4, so it seems to be related to radians. Better specify it in degrees, because that is what the television literature does.</li><li>Are you taking US NTSC's 7.5% setup into account? It seems you do, given that the default brightness and contrast settings are different from zero, though to a larger extent than 7.5% setup would do.</li></ol><br />Suggestions:<ol style="list-style-type: decimal"><li>I assume that &quot;colorimetry&quot; refers to the colorimetry of the emulated (&quot;source&quot;) display, and that the target display is always sRGB. Since wide-gamut displays are quite widespread these days, allowing to select the target display colorimetry might be desirable as well.</li><li>There are at least two more white points that were (and to some extent are) in widespread use: 9300K+27MPCD (xWhite  0.281, yWhite  0.311) and CIE D93 (xWhite  0.285, yWhite  0.293). Should you decide to add these, you might want to separate the RGB primaries from the white point. Note that when trying to simulate D93 white on sRGB, the blue value will become greater than 1, so everything must be scaled accordingly. Right now that is not done when entering these as custom values.</li><li>I understand you are using the default YIQ/YUV to RGB matrix. Using this matrix together with FCC primaries will reflect what an idealized NTSC monitor would show, but not necessarily the actual behavior of an 1980s television set. They would instead use a modified YIQ/YUV-to-RGB matrix with custom phosphors. These can be simulated perfectly if the values are known, which they are to some extent. <br />I don't know how deeply you want to dig into this, but given the work you have put into this already, you might want to consider the following two documents:<br /><a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&amp;arnumber=4080122&amp;isnumber=4080107" class="postlink">Neal, C.B., &quot;Television Colorimetry for Receiver Engineers,&quot; IEEE Transactions on Broadcast and Television Receivers, vol.BTR-19, no.3, pp.149,162, Aug. 1973</a> This documents contains both typical primaries and the matching YUV-to-RGB conversion matrices for 1970s televisions, good enough for NES purposes. The method of creating modified YUV-to-RGB conversion matrices for any set of primaries is described in this document: <a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&amp;arnumber=4319950&amp;isnumber=4319939" class="postlink">Parker, N.W., &quot;An Analysis of the Necessary Decoder Corrections for Color Receiver Operation with Non-Standard Receiver Primaries,&quot; IEEE Transactions on Broadcast and Television Receivers, vol.12, no.1, pp.23,32, April 1966.</a></li></ol>

The reason the brightness is lower is because I noticed the darkest row of colors didn't look right until I lowered it, and when raising the brightness on my TV, it takes a while for 1D to actually start lightening, so I figured the brightness setting is actually supposed to be lowered.

Most early video game consoles don't support this, but the end result is that a console that doesn't compensate for this in the US will have a smidge more contrast and darker than in Japan.

Normal sRGB images will appear oversaturated on them. Most web browsers nowadays can be made to color manage these images, that is, convert their values from sRGB to the monitor's native primaries. I have not seen any NES emulator provide that functionality. Therefore, it would be useful to specify the target monitor's primaries to generate the correct colors directly. Another advantage of this is that on these monitors, saturated reds and greens can be seen without them needing to be clipped (as much).<br /><div class="quotetitle">Drag wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">The custom colorimetry was a quick afterthought, so it doesn't do any scaling or anything like that. I'm not even sure how I'd need to properly &quot;scale&quot; anything.</div>Convert 100% white (R=G=B=1.0) to the target colorspace, take the largest value, and divide everything else by that, i.e. if you get R=1.0, G=1.1, B=1.2, then divide everything by 1.2. All this with linear values (the ones you use for color space conversion), not gamma-correct values.<br /><br />By the way: if you wanted to get really crazy, you could emulate differential phase distortion as well. Basically, your current hue setting is amplitude-independent, so it influences the hue shift at zero amplitude. You could add a second hue setting that is multiplied with Y, resulting in a total hue shift for any pixel of baseHue+Y*diffHue. While it does replicate what is definitely going on in some devices, it might be a bit far out there for emulation purposes.

There's no clearly correct thing to do if given contradictory gains needed to normalize both colorburst and sync depth.

If you're looking to design some graphics and you really need an accurate representation of the colors and how they contrast against each other, this is what I'd recommend. Even though I said this palette is darker, you don't even notice unless you have something BRIGHT WHITE open next to your emulator.<br /><br />This palette is pretty awesome. One question, is there something i can do to make the palette retain the green color from the border on the second stage of contra for nes? It is supposed to look like this:<br /><br /><img src="http://cdn.wikimg.net/strategywiki/images/0/02/Contra_NES_Stage_2a.png" alt="Image" /><br /><br />but instead it is just one single gray color, hardly any green. When this palette is used in conjunction with the ntsc filter it really shines. Just a few little tweaks and it will be almost perfect. Just figured i would ask since you know more about the settings on the palette generator page than i do. I always remember the nes colors being dark and gritty than most emulators show. Do you know what i can do to retain this green back and possibly just lighten up things just a tiny hair?<br /><br />anyways this palette generator is awesome, thanks for all you have put into it. Im definitely getting use of it.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I apologize for bumping this topic. I am sure many are aware of my open source project Retro Graphics Toolkit <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/viewtopic.php?f=21&amp;t=9894" class="postlink">http://forums.nesdev.com/viewtopic.php?f=21&amp;t=9894</a>. If you don't mind would it be okay if I use your code for palette generation? It was easy to port to C++. I have not committed the code as I have not implemented de-emphasis bits yet which I believe to be a necessary feature. If you have any pointers on how to implement de-emphasis bits I would appreciate that greatly.
