Has anybody gotten this rom to work on any emulator, or how can I tell what mapper is used in this game, for it may just be unsupported?

Are you planning to make a repro? If it doesn't run in any emulator, it's highly unlikely to run on an NES anyway, especially if you think it's a custom mapper.)<br /><br />Nestopia has a file menu option to edit the iNES header, it will tell you what mapper is being used.

I know alot about this pirate version, it is actually the parent to many smb2j pirate roms (except Lf-36 and Kaiser), this is the first one to be public in asia in january 1987, just six months after the fds disk came out. I would really like get this rom to work. Any more tips?

It points the interrupt vectors to $6000, which is canonically RAM, and I don't think a mapper exists that maps its 32K PRG into $6000-$DFFF, as this game probably wants. Not only is it not mapper 3, I don't think it's mapper anything.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I checked out this ROM out of curiosity and it's very weird. It's just 40KB (32KB PRG + 8KB CHR), meaning that treating it as CNROM (mapper 3) is exactly the same as treating it as NROM (mapper 0). Also, it indeed has all vectors pointing to the $6000 area. I honestly can't see this being a working version of SMB2J.

Heck, they may have just taken the ROM, slapped some mapping similar to that of the FDS and sold the cartridge like that (so it'd be like an NROM with extended address space).

I couldn't care less if it's a &quot;pirate cart&quot; version either -- it could be that the people who made the pirate cart screwed it up or used a custom mapper of their choice, or possibly someone dumped the ROM wrong.  My advice is the same in either case: just move on.  :-)

FDS SMB 2, but where's the rest of it (iirc there's something like 40 or 48K total of prg data on the FDS disk)?  Vectors at $6000 for a mapper that puts nothing at $6000?  It's definitely mislabeled, at least.  GoodNES has all sorts of worthless junk in it.  If you want a best playing experience of SMB2J, play the FDS version in any of the NES emulators that support FDS.
