		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I didn't know where else to post this. There are numerous simultaneous, cooperative 2 player games for the NES that I like to play with my wife sometimes, but usually she will quickly tire of these because of difficulty. Does anyone know of any rom hacks out there that make the second player invincible or take significantly more damage (in games in which this applies)? If not, I think I finally have motivation to do a simple rom hack of my own.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Super Mario Galaxy for Wii has such a "Co-Star mode": player 2 can shoot candy at enemies with the Wii Remote. I'd like to see a hack of SMB1 to freeze bad guys by shooting coins at enemies with the Zapper. Then the Koopas would really be <a href="http://pineight.com/mw/index.php?title=Jump_on_the_duck" class="postlink">ducks</a>.
<br />
<br />In Sonic 2 for Sega Genesis, Tails can't get hurt.
<br />
<br />In Kirby Super Star for Super NES, player 2 can regenerate at will at the cost of a change in power.
<br />
<br />In Chip n Dale Rescue Rangers for NES, one rodent can carry the other across the hard parts.
<br />
<br />There are probably bunches of Game Genie codes for infinite player 2 lives in games like Contra, TMNT 2/3, etc.

<br />05B6 - player 1 lives
<br />05E6 - player 2 lives
<br />
<br />And Chip 'n Dale 2:
<br />00A7 - player 1 lives
<br />00A8 - player 2 lives
<br />
<br />Played the games with a friend a while ago. Both of us were bloody noobs at it so I decided to cheat which made the them much more fun. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />

<br />If by Zapper you meant mouse on your PC (or Wiimote via Bluetooth) this would be a good job for Lua.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Seems like I remember in the Game Genie codebook, there were some codes for games that would give more lives / other stuff to a specific player.  I believe it had a 'handicap' icon or something similar, for those types of codes. (which could be codes that give you LESS lives, always wondered how many people used those, heheh)

<br />
<br />Perfect Dark allows player's to regenerate, taking part of the other player's health.
<br />
<br />Beavis &amp; Butthead you both share the same brain, I guess.
<br />
<br />Edit:
<br />
<br />Double Dragon II Game Genie codes:
<br />
<br />AASVETGE        Player 1 starts with 8 lives
<br />AAVVSTGE        Player 2 starts with 8 lives 
<br />PASVETGA        Player 1 starts with 1 life
<br />PAVVSTGA        Player 2 starts with 1 life 
<br />
<br />&amp; of course, people who first play this game are going to need these:
<br />
<br />SZXAYKVS        Never lose lives from falling
<br />SZVESUVS        Never lose lives from water
<br />
<br />Double Dragon III forces players to use another character once you die:

<br />I made a romhack that gives you unlimited continues:
