		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Hi!<br /><br />I'm trying to find some solid information about what parts of the PPU are still active when rendering is disabled. When I say &quot;disabled&quot; is mean when both bit 3 and 4 in $2001 are cleared.<br />Looking at the Ntsc_timing.png it doesn't say which operations are affected by disabling the rendering. I've tried to look at several PPU implementations, both they all differ in some way from each other.<br /><br />Here are my assumptions:<br /><br />1. All VRAM fetches (background and sprites) ALWAYS happens regardless if rendering is disabled or not (light brown boxes).<br />2. Skip PPU cycle on odd frames does NOT happen when rendering is disabled (green box).<br />3. All v (loopy_v) updates (inc hori(v), inc vert(v), hori(v) = hori(t) and vert(v) = vert(t)) does NOT happen when rendering is disabled (red boxes)<br />4. Clear vblank flag on line 261 ALWAYS happens regardless if rendering is disabled or not (green box)<br />5. Clear sprite 0 hit flag on line 261 ALWAYS happens regardless if rendering is disabled or not (green box)<br />6. Clear sprite overflow flag on line 261 ALWAYS happens regardless if rendering is disabled or not (green box)<br />7. Set vblank flag on line 241 ALWAYS happens regardless if rendering is disabled or not (green box)<br />8. Secondary OAM clear (cycle 1-64) does NOT happen when rendering is disabled<br />9. Sprite evaluation (cycle 65-256) does NOT happen when rendering is disabled (or on line 261)<br /><br />10. I'm also not sure about how the sprite output modules are filled from the secondary OAM. It was mentioned somewhere that they are implemented using some counters and shift<br />registers. Does this mean that each sprite output unit is filled with a counter that corresponds to the x position of where the sprite data should be outputed, and that this counter<br />is decremented for each rendering cycle? And when the counter reaches 0 it will eat bits from the shift register and output it? Are these sprite output units running when<br />rendering is disabled? If not, they could output old sprite data on one scanline if rendering is suddenly turned on in the middle visible scanlines (0-239). I guess these output modules<br />reset themselves after the pixeldata is output (make sense if they are implemented with a counter and 2 registers containing the pixeldata (hi and low bits) of spritedata)<br /><br />11. And one more thing.. during sprite evaluation on scanline S, this means that a sprite will be &quot;in range&quot; if the sprite's Y position is: S &gt;= Y &amp;&amp; S &lt; Y + sprite_height. This spritedata will be rendered on the next scanline S+1, this is the reason why sprites show up one scanline too late right? However, since sprite evaluation is not happening on the pre-render line 261, this means that<br />no spritedata will be output on scanline 0. However, will scanline 239 evaluate sprites with Y position zero? or will the sprite data fetching on line 261 corrupt this?<br /><br />I know this was a lot of questions, but I'm not able to rest until my PPU emulation is perfect.... I guess I won't be resting for quite some time..... <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />-Eicar

Only when the CPU reads/writes $2007.

The last sprite evaluation was done on line 239, so does that mean that the result from<br />this is still in the secondary OAM and the eight sprite output modules? (as the secondary OAM is not cleared on line 261) Are these leftovers then<br />incorrectly displayed on scanline 0? (Like garbage pixels etc..) I guess most games would stay away from putting too much on the first and last 8 scanlines due to the<br />overscan on most CRT sets so this would probably not cause any issues anyway...<br /><br />Thanks so far for all the answers!<br /><br />-Eicar
