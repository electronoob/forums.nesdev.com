<br />Maybe,but there's one thing: my determination.I'v already(when not at PC) wrote some code in notepad using pen.I'm rewriting it to PC right now, same for grafics.I WANT do it.I'm not going to give up.
<br />...All this mess is because of my dictionary.By accident it translated me June as July.I was thinking I still have 2 months <img src="./images/smilies/icon_lol.gif" alt=":lol:" title="Laughing" />

Hopefully next year there will be more people.  Regardless, my hope is to give incentive to finish projects.  You see so many good starts, and people talking about there games, but most of them never see the light.
<br />
<br />Good luck to everyone.... I should also note that I still hope to submit an entry, but decided last minute to take a summer class, so maybe add me to the "Who isn't submitting an entry" list <img src="./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" />

<br />
<br />I guess if I actually end up finishing it, it could be entered next year, if the contest happens again.

<br />Any chance of extending the deadline another month?  Or would it not be worth it if it only resulted in 2 or 3 more entries?

<br />I'll second that.  I'm sure most of us are waist deep in ambitious projects we'd LIKE to finish, but you can save that for next years <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />
