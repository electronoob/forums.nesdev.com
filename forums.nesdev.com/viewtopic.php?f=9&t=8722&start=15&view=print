<br />
<br />1024 * 16 = 16384
<br />
<br />SRAM cells are typically 6 transistors, so 16384 * 6 == 98304 T, in a 128 * 128 bit array. That means there's also a 7 bit row address decoder == 128 * (7 + 1) = &gt;1024, and a 4:16 decoder for the column + a bit of glue. It's more like 100k+
<br />
<br />If we're going by transistor count then the SRAM should cost 1.5x what a NMOS 68000 costs.

<br />
<br />Are you 100% certain that they are a pin for pin replacement?  Not something like two /CE's on them or something.
<br />
<br />There was some discussion of WRAM (work) in the video.  That shouldn't be able to cause graphical glitches like that.  If the WRAM was bad the game would crash, not graphic glitch.
<br />
<br />Make sure the chips have really good connections to the cartridge.  /CE and A10 for those VRAM chips are driven by the cartridge.  So if those signals were weak you could easily have problems like this.  Maybe even more suspect based on the fact they are toploaders.  Things like coke can get spilled inside and corrode tracks.
<br />
<br />Assuming those chips you got aren't super slow, I'd blame connections with the cartridge CIRAM /CE and CIRAM A10 specifically, CHR /A13, A10, &amp; A11 as well.  No other connections could cause problems like this.  It's highly doubtful that you've got a mess of bad chips.

<br />I was also seeing different little glitches with different sram chips, but eventually I got two that showed zero glitches, already have 5 chips that are either totally fried or still show some sort of glitch.
<br />I had several instances where a game would not boot, most likely wram had a bad sram chip.
<br />As far as access times and pinout, I don't know, as stated in the first post I can't find a datasheet for the original srams.

<br />What do the actual chips say on them.  If they are too slow you'd have this issue.  Hard to know if the datasheet isn't available and the part number doesn't give away the speed.

<br />
<br />IDK, maybe there is a reason they stopped making them. They are all crap!  Either way you should be able to get other 0.3" SRAM to work even if they are larger.  It might be easier to bend all the pins up and slap em on the bottom side of the mobo.  Remember you don't have to worry about matching the address lines up perfectly.  A10 on the mobo could connect to the datasheet's A14.  An address line is and address line and same goes for data.  A data line is a data line, you CAN'T trade an address line for a data line though or vice versa if that wasn't obvious.  So that might make wiring up 8-32KB SRAMs a little easier.

<br />Yeah you're right on that, I forgot about the dang old x10 factor.  The data sheet does say 10ns for those new ones though.  I don't think being faster should cause issues...

PRG RAM is traditionally decoded using NAND(PRG /CE, A14, A13, M2), such as the 74HC20-based circuit in Family BASIC. The trouble is that PRG /CE (used to distinguish $6000 from $E000) changes a few dozen nanoseconds later than the other signals, meaning writes to mapper ports at $E000-$FFFF might momentarily write to $6000-$7FFF if the RAM is too fast. Old versions of the PowerPak's MMC3 implementation had this problem, clearly visible as map corruption in M.C. Kids and Crystalis.
