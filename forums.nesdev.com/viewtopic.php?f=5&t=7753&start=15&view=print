The shadows, which are supposed to be projected on the background plane moves along with the foreground, which looks weird.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">Zepper wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">Ok, so what's the red and green thing?</div>
<br />Red indicates background, green indicates sprites. First, the image is shown normally, then the same footage is shown using the color coding. The consoles that have more planes use other colors to represent those planes.

<br />Video dated 2011/02/18 (NES/Famicom)
<br />* red = background
<br />* green = sprites
<br />
<br />Video dated 2011/02/25 (PC Engine)
<br />* red = background
<br />* green = sprites
<br />* pink = background colour
<br />
<br />Video dated 2011/03/09 (Megadrive/Genesis)
<br />* red = background A
<br />* cyan = background B
<br />* lavender = window
<br />* green = sprites
<br />* pink = background colour
<br />
<br />Video dated 2011/03/26 (SNES/Super Famicom)
<br />Video dated 2011/04/05 (SNES/Super Famicom)
<br />* red = background 1
<br />* cyan = background 2
<br />* lavender = background 3
<br />* yellow = background 4
<br />* green = sprites
<br />* pink = background colour
<br />* Chart in the bottom right indicates video modes (modes 0-7), since each video mode has different capabilities (e.g. different background counts, on-screen colours, and methodology).
<br />* The video mode used is shown on the left hand side of the video window, drawn via coloured bars.  For example, in part of the Super Mario Kart video, the top 1/4th of the screen is dark gray (using mode 0) while the remaining 3/4ths is white (using mode 7).
<br />
<br />Two videos I found amazing (well a lot of them are to me, but still):
<br />
<br />* Lemmings (SNES/SFC): the lemmings aren't sprites, but actually background tiles.  This explains why the lemmings don't flicker when there's a ton of them on a single scanline.
<br />* Gradius 3 and Parodius (SNES/SFC): how Konami did the ship's single-pixel laser effect.
<br />
<br />And of course, all the Yoshi's Story stuff is amazing, but that's also because it uses the FX chip.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Those videos were all very interesting!
<br />
<br />I always enjoy discovering how the professionals worked their way around limitations, etc. :-)
<br />
<br />The following is a sloppy translation of the Famicom video:
<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">===============<br />Contra:<br />==================<br /><br />Title screen:<br />-----------------<br />Albeit a kind of mediocre title screen, the graphics of their hair and shirts contain<br />utilise sprites.<br /><br />Because the BG itself has an insufficient amount of colours, sprites are used in<br />order to gain more colours to the artwork.<br /><br /><br />Area 1 cleared screen:<br />-------------------------------<br />After the area is cleared we get to see this scene…<br />And this is how sprites are used to allow for more colours in the picture.<br /><br />GAME TEXT:<br />------------------<br />&quot; We've arrived at &quot;point A&quot;.&nbsp; &nbsp;Commencing infilitration from here! &quot;<br /><br /><br />~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br /><br /><br />===============<br />Castlevania:<br />==================<br /><br /><br />Title screen:<br />-----------------<br />Pay attention to the upper left corner!&nbsp; It's impressive how they're frantically<br />concealing the horizontally scrolling picture, eh?<br /><br /><br />Boss:<br />--------<br />When you defeat this boss &#91;Grim Reaper&#93;, it'll undergo a transition to it's other form…<br /><br />Just after the transition the remnant floor gets moved a little bit upwards.<br /><br />As expected, this pretty much result in being a distraction from an otherwise<br />interesting scene.&nbsp; &nbsp;The transition from BG tiles to sprites, however, is really well<br />done, eh?<br /><br /><br />~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br /><br /><br />===============<br />Flappy:<br />==================<br /><br /><br />Immediately after the game begins all of the stones are represented by sprites,<br />however, the brown coloured stones turns into BG tiles very soon afterwards.<br /><br />I don't know why, but it seems that stones which is in contact with the ground<br />becomes part of the BG.<br /><br /><br />~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br /><br /><br />===============<br />Karateka:<br />==================<br /><br /><br />Carefully observe the enemy on the other side of the gate!<br />The Famicom utilises some sprites which purpose is to overlap a part of the<br />foreground pillar.&nbsp; This is done in order to hide the characters when they pass<br />through the gate.<br /><br />Something appeared!&nbsp; Of course, I don't mean the enemy but rather that of the pillar.<br />Retreat, and it'll disappear;&nbsp; advance, and it'll appear.<br />A properly timed retreat makes the enemy pass through the gate without getting<br />concealed by the frontmost pillar.<br /><br /><br />~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br /><br /><br />===============<br />Punch Out:<br />==================<br /><br /><br />This game features unusually large foes.<br /><br />The player as well as the referee are drawn by the use of BG tiles, but the foes are<br />composed entirely by sprites.&nbsp; &nbsp;This is quite bold, really, seeing that it's normal practice<br />in games to use BG to draw gigantic bosses.<br /><br />Little Mac's smooth movement makes it hard to think that he consists of BG tiles only.<br /><br /><br />~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br /><br /><br />===============<br />Rock Man 2:<br />==================<br /><br /><br />Title screen:<br />-----------------<br />The front building and the backdrop scrolls as if there were two layers of graphics, but<br />in reality it's only one single layer of BG artwork.&nbsp; &nbsp; The entire front building seems to<br />scroll independently from the rest of the BG thanks to an illusion made possible by<br />its patternless design together with sprites which resembling windows.<br /><br />Sprites are used at the spot where the 'N' overlaps the '2'.&nbsp; It seems that the reason for<br />this would be because of an insufficient amount of BG colours.<br /><br /><br />Stage select screen:<br />----------------------------<br />This is the stage select screen.<br /><br />While just playing the game one doesn't pay attention to this, but the fact is that sprites<br />are used in this manner…<br /><br />Looking at it with this mind, it certainly looks more vivid, eh.<br /><br /><br />Woodman's stage:<br />-------------------------<br />This is Woodman's stage.<br /><br />Being focused on avoiding the enemy projectiles, it may be difficult to notice that the<br />enemy's body is made up of BG tiles.<br /><br /><br />Dr. Wiley's stage:<br />------------------------<br />This is Wiley's first stage.<br /><br />The blocks that you have to cross are part of the BG until a certain point.&nbsp; After that,<br />any new blocks are actually sprites.<br /><br />The change from using BG to sprites for the blocks first happen here.<br /><br /><br />~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br /><br /><br />===============<br />Fire Emblem:<br />==================<br /><br /><br />Speaking of Fire Emblem, its showy battle scenes are very fascinating.<br /><br />Among other things, the size of D-Knight is surprisingly large.<br /><br />The party which turn it is to make an attack has its graphics changed from BG tiles to<br />sprites.&nbsp; &nbsp; Here you can see the sprites' framework.<br /><br />Pay attention to the spear and the tail, and you'll come to see the superb design.<br />None of the sprites disappear nor do they appear cropped during the<br />animation sequence. <br /><br /><br />~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br /><br /><br />===============<br />Dragon Quest IV:<br />==================<br /><br /><br />Battle related…….:<br />--------------------------<br />Since DQ2, it has been thought that the enemies have been all composed up by<br />BG tiles, but there's actually a surprisingly heavy use of sprites involved.<br /><br />Observe how sprites are cleverly put together in order to allow the enemies to have more colours. <br /><br />There are also enemies which overlap the window borders.&nbsp; &nbsp;The parts of an enemy<br />that overlaps a window is naturally composed by the use of sprites.<br /><br />----<br /><br />This chap is all alone, isn't he?<br />For this reason, lots of sprites can be spent on him alone.<br /><br /><br />Bon voyage:<br />------------------<br />This scene is at the end of chapter 4.<br /><br />Here we get to see what is seemingly two layers of BG tile graphics.<br /><br />By continuously updating the ocean tile with an animation &#40;each animation is simply <br />the source tile being shifted an increasingly number of pixel rows&#41; that matches the <br />speed of the ship, we're led to believe that there are actually two layers of graphics:<br />One layer with the ship on it, and one with the ocean + wharf.<br />The wharf is made up of sprites.<br /><br />If you look at the frame boxes, you'll notice that there are some sprites in the upper-left<br />corner.&nbsp; It seems to be some sprite fragments.<br /></div>
