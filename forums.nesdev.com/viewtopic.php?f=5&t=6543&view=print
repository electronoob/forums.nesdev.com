<br />I mentioned this simply because many programmers think that you can simply check the result after an fwrite()/fputc()/etc., missing that last possibly-failing buffer flush/finalize that fclose() does.

<br />An fclose() failing isn't a program bug; it's a normal occurrence in some run-time cases. Using assert() to catch this is itself a bug, since assert is for finding bugs in the program, not validating external conditions. So maybe in this case assert is finding a bug, that being the assert itself. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />

<br />
<br />Something like the good old fashioned "Abort, Retry, Ignore?" prompt, maybe.  That way the program would be paused while the user (maybe overestimating their capability for some problems) corrects the issue.  I can't think of a really simple way to implement 'retry' though (other than passing the 'failed' function and all it's parameters along to fatal_error().
<br />
<br />Any better suggestions?  My program is saving data too, would be nice to have it implemented safely.  That's one thing I'm not doing error-checking on, but would be the most annoying to have corrupted.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Below I'm talking about close(2), not fclose(3) (one's a syscall, the other's a libc function).  Just want to make that clear in advance.
<br />
<br />I can advocate that checking close(2)'s return code is both good and bad -- but because of the latter I opt not to bother.  If you want proof, here you go:
<br />
<br />In my <a href="http://bsdhwmon.parodius.com/" class="postlink">bsdhwmon</a> software, I used to check/verify the return status of FD passed to close().  The FD was originally open(2)'d on a device (/dev/smb0 in this case).  On occasion -- not consistently, but it did happen somewhat often -- the close() call would fail (return -1).  I'm guessing there was some particular quirk with regards to lingering I/O between the OS and the SMBus controller (possibly a quirk with ioctl(2), hard to say), although SMBus doesn't actually work this way (protocol-wise).  I did spend some time trying to track it down userland-wise (ktrace, truss, etc.) but never really got anywhere.  I can't remember what errno was set to, but it was consistently the same thing when this happened.
<br />
<br />Bottom line: topic smells of OCD/Asperger's syndrome.  Don't bother checking it.  *Do* check and validate statuses for read/write operations (e.g. bytes transferred vs. how much you asked for), and eof operations.

<br />
<br />well, that depends on which platform you are using... perhaps it's just me, but i rather have a false positive indication of that there might be a problem than no a indication at all. and assert() will only be pressent in a debug environment anyway so i don't really see the problem <img src="./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" />
<br />
<br />@tepples: i don't think it's necessary to check if the logfile couldn't close, especially if the last thing you did to the file was a flush.
<br />
<br />if you really want to make sure you don't destroy a document, don't open it for anything other than reading (then it doesn't matter if fclose fails) or just create a copy of the original before you write anything and then if it fails, you atleast have a backup file you can recover <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />

<br />Well, I was thinking more of a batch-style tool, the simplest case. The idea is to see how to handle fclose() failure in the simplest case, then scale up once that's understood. With a batch tool, the user wants to either know that it completed successfully, or know that something failed and possibly produced a corrupt output file, so he knows not to proceed. This is basically my fundamental basic correct program behavior model. Do not hide error conditions from the user. Don't silently do nothing if there's an error, unless the operation really was one that had no failure state.
<br />
<br />For a GUI-based program, you should use an atomic replace. At least on Apple's platforms, there is a call that atomically swaps two files' contents. So when saving a document, you create a temporary file, save to it, then swap its contents with the old file.

<br />And under any other UNIX environment, rename(2) has the same behavior. But I expect a lot of my users to be on Windows XP, where rename() returns -1 and sets errno to EPERM or EACCES (I forget which) if the destination file exists. MoveFileTransacted(), which performs an atomic replace, wasn't added to Windows until Windows Vista.
