		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I'm about to try this mod on my SNES that has a PPU layer burned out, which displays this vertical bar in the center very faintly, as another fully-working SNES does. I'm going to first try just one or two wires, then add some caps, to find what minimally eliminates it. If that works, I'm going to apply it to at least one other SNES, and then possibly another fat one and a mini one.<br /><br /><strong>Oh yes, I want to remind everyone</strong> to avoid the fate of the above mentioned SNES when opening it: unplug power cord, then turn SNES on to discharge filter capacitor, and when you have it open, still be very careful with the power switch on wires, being sure it doesn't touch the PCB.

But I just used regular electrolytic cap, I didn't piggy back different type like you did (not sure why you did this though).<br /><br />Edit: I guess it was the placebo effect, I removed the cap and the bar is no worse. But then again my bar is a bit different, it's still in the middle of the screen but it's narrower and I can also see a few thin line around the screen if I look closely. I use the intro of FF3 to verify it. The title screen is all clear and then when the screen start to roll down with the cloud the bars appear. I also use a S-Video cable if that make a difference.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I'm also using an s-video connection.<br /><br />First off, others here, like TmEE, are significantly more knowledgable than I am about hardware, I just experiment a lot. I tried and in the end removed the wires, since the bars were very faint on this SNES to begin with, and the added wires posed a significant risk of future shorting if one came loose. Even with all thse I could still see a very faint discoloration. Here's what mine looked like (click for larger):<br /><br /><a href="http://i.imgur.com/esCuu46.jpg" class="postlink"><img src="http://i.imgur.com/esCuu46l.jpg" alt="Image" /></a><br /><br />As you can see, I first marked the positive and negative rails, then planned the wires. I added one for the negative rail to the video output section, but decided that the negative rail is probably lower impedance in most places than the positive.<br /><br />I wasn't sure where would best help, and it became tedious and tiring adding them and not seeing any obvious total disappearance, so I ended up removing everything. Maybe if I had a SNES with a really obvious bar, and perhaps an osilloscope to measure what places make the most difference (and whether more capacitors are needed). At first my idea was to get direct paths from the regulator to the video chips, but then I got the idea that TmEE's approach was to instead get direct paths to the DRAM to eliminate the droop there and thus on everything else as a side-effect. That would use fewer wires.

The small caps are capable of shorting high frequency noise to ground.  Large caps can't do that though, they are used for supplementing the powersupply during power surges to minimize/prevent 'drooping' of the power supply.<br /><br />I wouldn't be surprised if's the combination of wires to overcome the weak vias, and capacitors (both large and small) that are needed.   They are both going to help in a situation like this and it sounds like TmEE is the only one who implemented BOTH improvements.<br /><br />Blargg: Even if you don't have an oscope, you can get a rough estimate on each improvement by using a multimeter if you've got one of those.  Measure across the rails (gnd to vcc) on the VAC (~V) setting.  Gives you an actual number, although it probably fluctuates pretty well.  Even better if your meter has averaging like some of the better ones do.

It seem that TmEE piggybacked smd capacitor over the smd cap already on the snes board and then soldered disc cap and electrolytic cap over. Why the extra smd cap? And will just any value work for the disc capacitor? Thanks
