I implemented that feature a while ago after reading about it in the wiki and after discovering some other games (or demos) depended on it.<br /><br />As a test, I just modified the associated code to return white when that code executes: <br /><br /><img src="http://i.imgur.com/njGf5Qg.png" alt="Image" /><br /><br /><img src="http://i.imgur.com/ENXAkH1.png" alt="Image" /><br /><br />So, those glitches are related.  Maybe it is some sort of timing issue where the color is not updated at the right point.

The HBlank?<br /><br />As for timing, my emulator renders the text boxes in Marble Madness correctly and Battletoads runs without a problem.  I don't know if I can make it more accurate than that.

And, why would it have to anyway?  It should always be the same number of cycles after the sprite 0 hit to the edge.

But no, they decided to use an obscure/undocumented aspect of the console, that's not even guaranteed to work on all revisions (didn't OAM read back fail on some Famicom models?).

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Sprite 0 hit gets into a ~20-pixel-wide ballpark. Polling on $2004 over the next few lines allows correcting from that ballpark to an exact position plus or minus one pixel. This sort of precise alignment to the horizontal blank becomes especially important for mid-frame palette changes.<br /><br />And to Codemasters and Color Dreams, everything was undocumented.

That provides a 6-7 cycle/18-21 pixel jitter.<br /><br />It then tests $2004 over eight successive scanlines, adjusting the PPU/CPU phase by one cycle (+1 pixel / -2 pixels) if necessary on each of those scanlines.

A lot of unlicensed NES work was done on the basis of reverse engineering. The game was also never released on Famicom, so even if the technique would have failed on that, it wasn't relevant.<br /><br />If it works, it works. The fact that it's annoying to emulate is our problem, not theirs. The emulated-NES platform didn't even exist then, they had no reason to make any concessions for it (even if they could predict the future and know that this technique would be tricky for us).
