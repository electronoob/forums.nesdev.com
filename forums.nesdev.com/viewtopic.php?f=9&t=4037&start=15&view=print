I don't remember how old I was but got them as a Christmas gift when I was in Jr high and I am now in my mid 20s. I did not figure out till years later what they actually were. They are green N64 controllers with the word gamemaster printed up top with built in pirate games. and a famicom cartridge slot on the back along with a player 2 famiclone standard controller slot
<br />
<br />I do not know if they compare to newer clones or not.
<br />
<br />Well anyway the most common game with noticeable timing differences is SMB 1 using these famiclones

<br />
<br />But in my small amount of time using it, the SMB music being wrong, and the colors seeming off were the main issues other than it looking shitty and having shitty controllers. As far as I could notice, the games I played were fine other than that issue. I never noticed a game that actually behaved noticably different. Like tepples I'm really curious if there are games that have such serious problems. 
<br />
<br />Atleast everyone will agree that you should use a Nintendo original system for anything important.

<br />Level balance between the (fake) 2A03's PSG and the cart's PSG might be an issue, and various kinds of distortion from the mixer might be an issue.

<br />Those things are awesome.  I bought one for my mother in law.  I left my SNES at her house last Christmas when my wife and I visited.  I heard from ym upset father in law that she played Tetris Attack nearly non-stop for 6 months <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />  
<br />
<br />Well, I wanted my SNES back, and her regular NES had died. This new NES/SNES hybrid was an excellent gift for her.
<br />
<br />(I have the most freaking awesome in-laws in the world!)

<br />I have a Messiah NEXGen console I use quite frequently, as I like the size.  There are definately major problems though.
<br />
<br />My main issue with it is that it doesn't run any Koei games, which happen to be my favorites..  Does anyone know if this is a common thing with clones, or is this just the NEXGen one?  Is it the same story with the RetroDuo?

<br />I did not try any NES games this weekend, and I know that she doesn't have any Koei games.  I do have Genghis Khan.  If I remember, I'll take it down when my wife and I visit for Christmas and try it.
