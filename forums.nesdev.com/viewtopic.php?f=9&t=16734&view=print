(Maybe that only applies to RMW instructions, though? It seems like the read-only instructions aren't capable of doing a double read from the same address?)

I don't remember exactly the address pattern that happens during a DPCM deletion, so I don't know exactly how it would go.<br /><br />I guess that with the NES, you'll only get a single bit deletion, where as things that care about M2, such as the the Famicom and 2C02 $2007 you'll see multiple bits of deletion.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">It seems like the read-only instructions aren't capable of doing a double read from the same address?<br /></div>I think you're right.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />With a quite big risk i'm misreading your intentions (sorry, in that case): <br /><br /><br />You can load any addressable data into your A,X,Y registers and then write it to the controller ports, with an appropriate routine, but it's slow, since it is serial. You probably want to be frugal about what sort of data you're sending/receiving. <br /><br />Connecting two NES:es this way for 2-television, 2-NES multiplayer is possible, but the games probably need to be pretty basic. You're best off trying something turn based, like a game of battleships or a card game or something. <br /><br />You can put a dual ported RAM and shift registers between the two units as a middleman device, if you so wish. That may make interaction easier since the NES:es don't need to sync talk/listen phases. <br /><br />There was a thread recently about a realworld proof of concept, using a laptop as a middleman server. Another related item is memblers' usb-to-nes controller cable which is part of the kit that lets you reprogram GTROM boards. I think partytimeHXLNT:s twitter reader/poster for the NES used the controller port, too. <br /><br />You also need to be mindful of what cable you're using. Not all controller port cables (new or old) have all the wires present. Ask your manufacturer if buying new ones from china.

You can pass it on to the PPU from the CPU, if you want, though for CHR data that requires the use of CHR-RAM, of course.<br /><br />I'm not sure there's many practical applications for this kind of thing, though. The serial port is very low bandwidth, and not too bad for input devices, but sending bulk data will be very slow, and probably for most purposes you can just get more data onto the cart some other way that is cheaper and faster?
