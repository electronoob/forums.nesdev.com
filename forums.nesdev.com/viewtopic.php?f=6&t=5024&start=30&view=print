		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Drag's engine appears to handle the duty+volume side of instruments the same way my engine handles the duty+volume side of sound effects. In this case, you'd maintain a pointer to the duty+volume stream for each channel, and every time you start a note, you'd just reset the pointer to the start of the stream for a given instrument.
<br />
<br />To put it another way: If a note is longer than the duty+volume stream, repeat the last element(s) of that stream until key-off. If a note is shorter, stop reading that stream.

<br />
<br />To handle this I've though of instrument definitions divided in 4 parts: attack, decay, sustain and release. Attack and decay information would be used as the note starts, the data defined for sustain would be repeated over and over, and as the note is about to end the data for release is used. Hasn't anyone tried something similar?

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />When stuff needs to happen towards the end of a note, I usually calculate when it needs to happen based on how long the note is, and then have it happen at that point. Say that 4 "ticks" before a note ends, I want it to decay. So I know the note is 15 ticks long, so by the time 11 ticks have happened, I need to start the volume decay. I needed to implement this for the Triangle Wave so that right before a note ended I could silence it for a moment to make each note more distinct. That's about as far as I ever went for something like that.

<br />
<br />I don't use bits %00110000 of $4000 for the lists, since the software always sets them to a constant. So instead, I have those bits signify a command for the envelope.
<br />
<br />For example, you'd need a command for "stop the envelope here until key-off", or "loop back to position xx until key-off" in order to get what you're talking about.
