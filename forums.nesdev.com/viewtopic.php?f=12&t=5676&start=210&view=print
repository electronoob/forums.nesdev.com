		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Cic question. I have read the posts, downloaded the cic files, bought the 12f629 pics, my programmer has the capability to work this pic, so my question is this: there are 4 files in the cic folder &quot;lock.asm and lock.hex. + key.asm and key.hex. I assumed that the key.hex was the file to program (for cartridge cic replacement) but when I try the hex file, it's wayyyyy too big. So is the asm file the one to use? Or does the file need to be assembled? And how to do that?   The PIC has only 1k memory and the key file is much larger than that.  <br /><br /> I guess I'm just looking for the right file to directly program. Can I get some direction? I see you plan to sell them. Will they be &quot;locked&quot; or readable?  Will it come with jumper instructions for the different applications?<br />I plan to integrate this into some new cart designs I'm working on....<br />Thanks<br />Mark

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Hi<br />I don't plan to resell them but if I have the capability to burn my own, I'd like to be able too.<br /><br />I'm wanting to make my own cartridges but until I can make one without a MAD chip and don't need to outsource the CIC, I'm hesitant to go forward.  Too many times (in the arcade world) a source for ____ (fill in the blank for x part or info) something disappears and then you are stuck.  I've learned to try to do as much as I can for myself.  I totally understand the desire to recover some of your expenses for your time and trouble.  I'd be happy to contribute to that.  And it just bugs the heck out of me to not understand how and why something works.  I guess I must have the super CIC files.  I'm thinking that's why I'm not understanding this...<br /><br />So you plan to have a pinout adapter for original cartridges? Good idea.<br /><br />Mark

I just reassembled the source and it uses 510 words of the 1KW in the '629.<br /><br />If you are loading it correctly, then this sounds like a programmer problem, and something you should bring up with them.
