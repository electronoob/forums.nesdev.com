		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Since iNES mapper 004 includes both MMC6 and MMC3.... and they have different (incompatible) ways of disabling cartridge WRAM, in my emu I've just been having WRAM enabled all the time, and writes to $A001 (or whatever reg controls it, can't look it up right now) simply go nowhere.
<br />
<br />But I recall in other threads that some emus (namely Nintendulator) require the game to specifically enable WRAM before it can be used.
<br />
<br />How is such a thing organized in a way that allows Startropics 1+2 to be playable?  Are CRC checks being done to see if the game is MMC6 or not?
<br />
<br />Just wanted some insight into how other emu authors are handling this.

<br />All MMC6 games will write to $8000 with bit 5 set before accessing WRAM (if my understanding is correct), so that could be a way to test possible MMC6 presence (although it's not a guarantee).  If a game does not set $8000.5, that game is definitely not MMC6.

<br />
<br />I find myself doing runtime checks like this for several other mappers.  I always sort of sigh in dismay when I do it, but take comfort in that it really is unavoidable due to iNES mapper assignment issues.
<br />
<br />Mappers that come to mind are:
<br />
<br />071 - Fire Hawk uses one screen mirroring, but no other game uses one screen mirroring, so I have to watch for $9xxx writes and switch from "Normal" mode to "Fire Hawk" mode when the game writes there
<br />
<br />019 - Some games use $C000-$DFFF to control mirroring, others use vertical mirroring (hardwired?).  To make things worse, games which don't use mapper controlled mirroring still write to mirroring regs!  So I have to watch writes to $C800-$CFFF ... I stay in Vertical mirroring until the game writes to there, then I switch to mapper controlled mirroring.
<br />
<br />080 - One game (don't remember the name) uses 1-screen mirroring controlled by $7EF0 and $7EF1 -- other games use H or V mirroring controlled by $7EF6.  I stay in 1-screen mode until $7EF6 is written to.
<br />
<br />
<br />This is kind of unavoidable stuff though.  I mean I can leave WRAM on all the time to solve the MMC3/MMC6 issue... but I can't leave things in a fixed mirroring mode for the above mentioned.

<br />How about "file name contains the word tropics"? Or what MMC3 (not MMC6) based NES games have that word in the title?

<br />
<br />This all seems pretty crazy, since it's unrelated to NES emulation and even specific game emulation. Why is the iNES file format enshrined in stone? Add a new mapper number for MMC6 and supply some kind of utility program that has all this GoodNES-style knowledge, but keep the emulator pure. I can't think of any emulator author that wouldn't embrace something that simplifies their job, and the users would just have to accept the change if they wanted to use the latest emulators.
<br />
<br />Just my opinion. Emulation is already complex enough as it is.

Older emulators would just ignore those bits as usual and stay compatible, and newer emulators would interpret them as mapper sub-type number, eg. 1 for MMC6 when main mapper number is 4. This would make unreliable CRC checks and/or runtime checks unnecessary.

<br />
<br />The most important thing is to limit the scope of what is being attempted. As I understand it, the goal is to remove the ambiguity in specifying which mapper is being used (and possibly some extra hardware). Attempting to throw in a kitchen sink would definitely ruin the effort. I'll wait for Disch's new thread before I think more about it.

<br />
<br />Not all emulators work that way - mine will outright <em>refuse to open the file</em> if there is <strong>any</strong> data in the upper 8 bytes. The only side effect is that it will not load any ROMs meant for iNES 2.0 or later (for the 8KB RAM page count; iNES 3.0 or later for the NTSC/PAL bit), but, seriously, how many of those are there?
