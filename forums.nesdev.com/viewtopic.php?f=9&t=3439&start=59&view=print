<br />For audio out, I just stuck a resistor from pin 3 to pin 9 of the EXP port. Around 50kohm seems ok, though maybe you'd prefer using a pot instead. Previous posts about audio mods suggested sticking some caps in there too, but it sounds fine to me without any. <span style="font-size: 75%; line-height: normal">*shrug*</span>

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />The VRC6 mapper works in my PowerPak (on a Famicom with adaptor), and the sound through the expansion pin sounds fantastic: clear and beautiful.  You're sending sound out of cart pin #54 (pin #9 on the expansion port).  Is there any reason why you chose this pin?
<br />
<br />As an aside, but something that might be more than just a coincidence, the 72-&gt;60 pin adaptor that I use has the FC's audio in/out pins tied together and also connected to NES cart pin #51 (also pin #6 on the expansion port)  So if you send the VRC6 audio out through cart pin 51 rather than 54, I bet no physical connection is necessary to get this additional audio channel coming out of the Famicom.  (The extra channel does, however, drown out or override the regular Famicom audio when I connect pins 54 and 51 together...)
<br />
<br />Anyway, is EXRAM/extra name tables/ATT table emulation working for this mapper?  Akumajou Densetsu has very glitchy graphics running on my PowerPak on Famicom.  Also, when I connect the extra sound channel (NES cart pin 54) to anything, the graphic glitching increases and the game sometimes may crash.  Any idea why?  Or do I have just too much interference by having an adaptor, wires coming out of pins, etc?
<br />
<br />Finally, the VRC6 channel works in the NSF player, but the sound is very warbly, completely unlike the VRC6 game mapper.  I'm using your NSF player dated Nov. 10.

<br />You can't wire audio in, audio out, and exp audio all together like that, they need to be mixed somehow.
<br />
<br />VRC6 doesn't have EXRAM etc., that's MMC5.

I am tempted to try this out as it can't be very hard to solder a resistor from point A to B. I'd love to play CV3 with the Japanese audio expansion, as well as FDS if you decide to do that.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Akumajou Densetsu gives me weird vertical line artifacts. The lines are usually black (they seem to act the same each time), and they appear to occur more or less uniformly...about 2 or so pixels from the edge of the 8x8 tile. This isn't always the case, though. Sometimes, the vertical lines flicker and are barely visible(i.e. during the beginning scroll, on the holes at the edges of the film, on Trevor's sprite, etc). Other times, they don't even extend all the way to the upper edge of a tile, and aren't even in increments of 8 pixels away from each other...or are even doubled up. Except for the two above-mentioned exceptions, they're pretty much all solid.
<br />
<br />I am an idiot when it comes to this stuff, and I don't know what to blame. Maybe one of my pins isn't making good contact? (I had to tweak them) Oh, and no other games on the powerpak seem to give me this issue.
<br />
<br />On a related note, I thank thee, loopy, for the VRC6 powerpak mapper in all its awesomeness. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />
<br />
<br />
<br />MottZilla: I think he used a 47KOhm resistor, I got one at radioshack and it looked identical to the one in the photograph. I used it, and it works great <img src="./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /> The issues above are unrelated to the modification, they actually happened before (and after) I performed the modification.

<br />
<br />Its crazy, i was talking about this last month with someone, how powerpak could do it via the xpansion slot, and there you go, you went and did it.
<br />
<br />Now, i've got my pin 9 running through a 100k resistor to pin 3 (the original audio goes through 100k resistors, and i tested with a variable resistor and around 100k was the sweet spot where the vrc6 soundtrack to castlevania 3 japanese sounded like an NSF player, equal levels etc).
<br />
<br />now, here's a question.  I want to separate the vrc6 audio.  
<br />
<br />I've done the mod from raph.net where you take channels 0,1, and 2, 3, 4, and separate them (so i could boost triangle/noi/dpcm), but when i tried to hook the audio from pin 9, and the ground (pin 2, but i tested at many ground points), i got ZKKZKZKZKZKZKZKKKKZKZKZ in my audio mixer.
<br />
<br />Quick test showed it wasn't the mixer, the cable, or the nes messing up. 
<br />
<br />My question is, why does the vrc6 work going through the AIN pin and out the audio out jack, but not directly into the mixer?
<br />
<br />I know i'm missing something probbly very basic and obvious.  Maybe if you know what the nes audio circuit does to the signal form pin 3, i can just build a little board that will do the same, so i can have 3 rca jacks, 1  all for the vrc6 (and other expansion audio things you graciously provide us with).
<br />
<br />Well, here's hoping you know, and answer <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />
<br />
<br />thanks a million for this stuff.

<br />Duh, i just reread what you wrote and you claerly didnt' need my entire message.
<br />
<br />What i was going to say was basically what you said, but i had a less elegant solution.  But according to my pinout diagram, its pins 45 and 46 that are audio I and O, not 51?  Unless maybe VRC6 uses pin 51 for sure? 
<br />
<br />Either way, my 72 pin adaptor not only has esposed leads for you to solder to, it also has nicely drilled holes for you to solder any junctions or patches you desire in to it.  here's a picture, ignore the quality i took it with a webcam
<br />
<br />if your 72 pin adaptor is not like mine, let me know, and i can help you find one like mine
<br />
<br />
<br />note the little holes, for doing just the sort of mod you suggest.
<br />
<br />BTW, i would reccoment a 100k resistor, instead of 50k, but that ws my own audio preference .
