Also the RAM bankswitching gives a new advantage (assuming you need or want to animate everything at once), because you can have the partially-updated version of the bank only switched in during vblank.

Those are the main disadvantages in comparison to MMC1,3,etc.  But I think a program that plays well to Squeedo's strengths could do things never seen before on NES.  Especially when running useful code in the PIC, it's like parallel processing.  Other than when playing sound with my synth code, the PIC has tons of idle time to put to use.  It's just up to figuring how and what to make it do, heheh.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=10">Memblers</a> — Mon Jun 13, 2005 1:24 am</p><hr />

Only one project to make a universal NES cart has gotten anywhere.

Potential practical issues with the Squeedo design, as I understand it: <ul><li>I'd imagine that the PIC introduces latency. Thus mid-scanline bankswitching might be a bit tougher. In addition, the 2D lookup table technique of setting the bank to one register then indexing off another register won't work without a lot of speed-killing NOPs to wait for the PIC to catch up. </li><li>In addition, the VRAM bankswitching is 8 KB like CNROM, meaning you can't easily do a SMB2-style background CHR rotation loop, but if your scrolling isn't really fast, then perhaps you might be able to do it Battletoads style, with a hyper-unrolled copy of 8 tiles per frame. </li><li>With 32 KB bankswitching, you'll be limited in the amount of DMC samples you can use, as you'll have to either reproduce them in every bank (which you have admitted that the loader is capable of) or copy your whole game engine and map data into SRAM. (This is part of why Battletoads pauses the game whenever playing a sample.) </li></ul> I wonder if an MMC3 clone would fit on a cheap CPLD.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=9">tepples</a> — Sat Jun 11, 2005 9:47 am</p><hr />

Nope, you're limited to the 'mapper' that's on the cart.  Noone has made a universal one.  So you'd need to modify a cart for each mapper, and program some flash or eprom chips.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=10">Memblers</a> — Fri Jun 10, 2005 1:52 pm</p><hr />

Hey,<br /><br />I should be able to start selling them probably in a month.  For around $80, how does that sound?<br /><br />But, as has been mentioned in some past threads, Squeedo's hardware is different from what most games used.  Megaman 1 may be able to <em>run</em> on it, but it's likely to have graphic glitches making it unplayable.  The later Megaman games, and a lot of other games definitely can't work on it.<br /><br />It's pretty easy to use.  The quickest way will be to run a program to upload the file on PC (.NES, .NSF, or raw prg), then you turn the NES on (or cycle the power) and it should automatically download, flash the prg, and run it.  Same method for flashing the PIC microcontroller too, just using a different upload program.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=10">Memblers</a> — Thu Jun 09, 2005 5:38 am</p><hr />

I went with RS232 instead of USB because it's a lot simpler, no special drivers or software is needed.  Just a standard terminal program with XMODEM, at the very least.  It'd be possible to make a USB adapter for the rev1 Squeedo with the current PIC, but the USB transceiver chip itself costs $5 or so, and it needs more components still.<br /><br />Any 5V circuit can hook up to the rev1 Squeedo, it supplies 4 I/Os plus VCC/GND.  The rev2 (smaller) Squeedo I/Os are RS232-level off the board instead of 5V, that's the main difference.  I also need to do testing with the address latch on the rev2 design.  But the rev1 design is stable and finalized.<br /><br />I posted new pics in the hardware forum.<br /><br />For the Atari carts, most of them are just using recycled cases.  The newer cases aren't too cheap.  Someone either payed big bucks, or did a lot of work creating a mold for them.  That's the big cost with making cases.<br /><br />I've designed my cart in way that I can produce as many of them as needed, but there are no plans for custom cases.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=10">Memblers</a> — Thu Jun 02, 2005 10:17 am</p><hr />

Sounds like a lot of work to dump like that, though.  NES only has 2kB of RAM, so even dumping the smallest (24kB) NES cart this way would require swapping carts over 12 times.  A much better solution would be if I make more NES controller port versions of my serial adapters (I suppose I could, if people actually want to use them - I offered them before), that way you only need to swap carts once, since the COM port would always be available.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=10">Memblers</a> — Thu Jun 02, 2005 5:05 am</p><hr />
