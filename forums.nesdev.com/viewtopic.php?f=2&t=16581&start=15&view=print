Even though MMC3 uses $2000 sized banks, there's no reason you can't program in $4000 sized chunks, as long as you set both the $8000-9fff bank and the $a000-bfff banks every time you switch PRG banks.<br /><br />That would make it similar to MMC1 or UxROM boards.<br /><br />MMC3 is still better than both, because of the scanline counter IRQ, which can do parallax scrolling (for example).

Say you switch bank y into window 6 ($8000) and bank y+1 into window 7 ($A000), and y can be either even or odd. Then you can access anything in ROM that doesn't cross two bank boundaries. <em>The Curse of Possum Hollow</em> does this with its compressed tiles and background map streams.

At first Nestopia wouldn't load it at all (&quot;Corrupt rom&quot;) but when I used org instead of base, now it will load but not display the hud (even though FCEUX displays it perfectly)

If this is the case, the solution is to tweak the timing until the scroll change takes place consistently before or after the PPU's increment.<br /><br />As for the hardware issue, it sounds like the IRQ isn't firing at all. Maybe you're not setting it up correctly, and the PowerPak implementation is more demanding than the ones in the emulators you tested.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />If you do want to test with FCEUX, at least use the &quot;New PPU&quot; setting (Config &gt; PPU). It does a much more accurate job than the default setting.<br /><br />As for how to adjust the timing, the simplest way is just to add NOP (&quot;no operation&quot;) instructions between the start of the IRQ and the point where you set the scroll. Each NOP will delay 2 cycles (6 pixels) without affecting anything else. The ideal place to alter scroll is within the horizontal blank period. (You can use a loop to make the code smaller, each NOP is 1 byte.)<br /><br />In Nintendulator or FCEUX (or other debugging emulators) you can put a breakpoint on your scroll register write and see where in the scanline it occured in their debuggers. That can help find the right delay for hblank. (Always test raster effects on hardware, though.)<br /><br />There's some info here about the timing of the PPU, e.g. where to find hblank:<br /><a href="https://wiki.nesdev.com/w/index.php/PPU_rendering" class="postlink">https://wiki.nesdev.com/w/index.php/PPU_rendering</a>

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />FCEUX has been set to New PPU the whole time. The status bar is still rock solid in that one.<br /><br />I put in a loop to delay the scroll write until Nintendulator was reporting it happening at a tick somewhere in the low 300s (305 to about 311; it varies a bit). It was still jittery. Is that during hblank? I wasn't quite sure from the link, but I got the impression that it's basically any time after tick 257?<br /><br />To clarify a little, the status bar is solid when the screen isn't moving. If you just sit there, it looks solid. When the screen scrolls though, sometimes the status bar almost &quot;jumps to catch up&quot; as it were (but sometimes it doesn't and looks fine). I attached the rom in case you want to see the effect.

Then you won't have to deal with exact timing, as you can't see if a completely black scanline is scrolled wrong. I'm pretty sure that's how most original NES games did it, too.<br /><br />Edit: Oh, I was a little fast and didn't notice you're using all four nametables and scroll vertically. Nevermind my suggestion above, it obviously doesn't apply here.
