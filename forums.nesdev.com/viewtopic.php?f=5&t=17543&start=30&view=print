		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />It's hard to say. 30 years ago everything was in print and as a kid it was the only way to get information. I remember waiting every month for Nintendo power, sharing EGM magazine at school and other popular one like, what was the name, gamepro I think? It's was the only way to get information about the latest games and we were all over it.<br /><br />Fast forward today, those magazine don't exist anymore or are dying since now everything is available online and the need is not there. Even though in Japan Famitsu is still popular and is released weekly, I rarely buy one because the information is rarely worth it.<br /><br />So if you do such a magazine, you have to keep in mind that you want to do it because you have a personal interest in making such a thing (that what hobbies are for, isn't it <img src="./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" /> ). Maybe you will have a following, maybe not. It will depends on how much dedicated you are and how creative you will be.<br /><br />The best thing is to just make a simple one, a few pages, keep it digital at first. If it becomes popular then you can think about printing it.

If we did worried about that we woudn't still playing and making nes game today aren't we? <img src="./images/smilies/icon_lol.gif" alt=":lol:" title="Laughing" /><br /><br />Just try, improvise, let your mind free. Don't worry about being perfect. Just try and you will learn from it.  You are young so this is the perfect time to experiment.
