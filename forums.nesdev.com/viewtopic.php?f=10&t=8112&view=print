		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Hi! I'm John Doom. I'm making a little game using nbasic (no discrimination, pls xd). At the beginning, when I was using standard code (i.e. arrays using byte lists and sprites created per animation), it was ok. Now I'm using various tricks involving sub routines and cicles to save space:
<br />- 3 mass of sprites each using sprites associated to variables and sub rouitines
<br />- 4x4 tiles and auto-coloring (using variables each 4x4 tile is already associated to a tile and a palette)
<br />When I started the sprite thing, each emulator but VirtuaNES dispalyed missing sprites (each emulator a diferent one)
<br />And now, using the 4x4 trick, each emulator (but VirtuaNES, again) displays random errors in the background. Actually VirtuaNES doesn't display the first tile of the 4th line of each 4x4 tile, but the rest is perfect.
<br />Now I was wondering:
<br />1) Is VirtuaNES the worst NES emulatorever? I'm not sure, because, as I said, each emulator shows a different error, but not the same.
<br />
<br />2) Can someone test my game on a real NES? It uses 2prg and 2chr. If my game fails even on a real NES, I'll change my scripts.

Either test in Fceux/Nestopia/Nintendulator combo or at least one of those to use constantly for development or you're game probably won't work. Games that work in a certain emulator might as well be web pages, you'd get more people that cared.
<br />
<br />And I can't really help with your program, and I dunno if you can get much help. If your game isn't in assembly, then you either broke a rule of the program or it just can't do something the way you did it or something. I'd say just review it and look over it many times...and start reading the Nerdy Nights while you're at it. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" />

<br />
<br />And mediafire is much nicer than megaupload, use that instead.  No 40 second wait time.
<br />
<br />Edit: At least force the screen off before it draws the playfield, then turn the screen back on during NMI.  I have no clue how much implementation details NBASIC is hiding from you, but if you can't make it do that, switch to C.

<br />
<br />Well you can do _anything_ in assembly if you write it, so sure. But what do you mean exactly? I've never heard of "4x4 tiles"....You just mean stuff like meta tiles and bigger sprites? <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />

<br />Do you mean metatiles that are 4x4 tiles large and their attributes? Sure it's possible, lots of games used that. You just can't draw the whole screen at once in one VBlank... You can draw a complete screen when rendering is off, but once you turn it on, you only have the time of VBlank to perform screen updates (about 2273 CPU cycles), not enough to draw an entire screen.

<br />I have another question (but I don't know if I can ask it in this 3d): the game I'm developing uses an MMC1 mapper. I made bankX (which stores input and routines to draw sprites, pals and backgrounds), bankY (which stores a level) and bankZ (which stores a music). If I want to draw bankY's level and bankZ music at the same time, should I bankswitch to bankY and then to bankY? Is it possible?
<br />Or the code/data used together must be in the same bank (i.e: bankX stores code and data of an entire level)?

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Music doesn't run "at the same time" as anything else.  Usually you switch to the music code/data, and call your "update sound" routine there.  Then you're done, you've played the music for one frame, and you don't need the music code/data mapped into memory any more, until the next frame when you update sound again.  You can then switch to whatever bank you want to.
<br />
<br />There is one exception however, DMC samples must be in the C000-FFFF bank.  So if you use 16k bankswitching, it eats away at the fixed bank.
<br />
<br />Usually you call the music engine update code at the end of your vblank routine, after you're all done drawing new graphics and have set the scrolling.

<br />You should refrain from having code copied multiple times in your ROM. If all the data a certain piece of code will ever have to use fits in a 16K bank along with the code itself, then the code and data could be in the same bank. Otherwise, (to keep from needing to have the same code in multiple banks) keep them in seperate banks.
