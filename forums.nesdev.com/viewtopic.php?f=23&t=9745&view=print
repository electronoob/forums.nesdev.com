Hope it'll happen soon. What do you think?

I imagine this hooks into the PSX OS or something, similar to how the things on PS2 allow playing games from the hard disk (which also behaves differently and breaks some games, requiring lots of workarounds). So this response seems deceptive.

PSIO is not emulated, and it is the real deal.</div><br />Really, now, this thing acts <em>exactly</em> like a CD so that the game runs no differently at all?</div><br />The PS2's DVD drive defaults to acting like a 2x CD drive, despite being able to read CDs much faster than 2x, because some games crash if the CD drive is faster than the original PlayStation's 2x. Homebrew games designed for PSIO won't break, but some copies of proprietary commercial games are likely to break.<br /><br />The terminology &quot;PS1&quot; may be confusing for anything related to PSIO because the PSone intentionally dropped both the parallel port and the serial port. Even the last revision of the original PlayStation before the PSone (the SCPH-9000 series) dropped the parallel port because only unlicensed accessories were using it.<br /><br />Is an original PlayStation capable of reading and writing PlayStation 2 memory cards, or is there a hardware limitation? I wonder if this could be used as yet another Free McBoot bootstrap.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Apparently the I/O port may have Left and Right audio too. So I suppose if the BIOS calls for all disc functions are patched it's perfectly doable to run games from an SD card. I'm not sure how the Decoder works which handles the .XA or FMV video but if it's fed from the CPU reading the disc then I guess that's no problem either. I hope the project comes to market. Particularly with 32GB SD cards being so common and pretty cheap now. And I hope that compatibility is high.
