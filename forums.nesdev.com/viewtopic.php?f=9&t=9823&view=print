It worked, excepting for not figuring out how to solve the mirroring problem, witche caused some glitches and chaotic map stuff. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_neutral.gif" alt=":|" title="Neutral" /> Then I modified the whole circuit to AOROM-UOROM conversion, hoping that it will work fine. But now it doesn't work at all for UNROM/UOROM. It only works for AOROM but when I set the switches for UNROM no answer...<br />Has someone done this type of conversion?

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />It's certainly possible I implemented the conversion using several solder jumpers.  Post up your schematic and I can probably help you figure out where you're going wrong assuming your schematic matches your circuit.  Keep in mind the UNROM has 16KB banks and AxROM has 32KB banks so you need to make and break PRG A14 when going back and forth.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Where are the outputs of the first 4 UOROM switches going?  Based on your labels is sounds like you're connecting them to the PRG-ROM.  They shouldn't be, they should only be connected to the '32 inputs, and the outputs of the '32 should drive the PRG-ROM A14+<br /><br />I'm also making a lot of assumptions based on the labeling since I don't have the pin number definitions commited to memory.  I suggest giving them more useful names like PRG-ROM A15 vice pin #-32.  Oh nvm, I think I just figured out where the actual connection are, you're feeding those to the '32 and then back through the other dip switches.  It looks like it should work, the only condition to that is I'm assuming you're pin numbering is correct  I'll leave that for you're verification and/or labeling.<br /><br />Check your connections from NES connector to the expected in on the mapper and roms etc with a multimeter.  Check every single last one until you figure out what minor mistake you make in the connections.  You can also check for shorts in likely locations.  There are 100s of possibilities that could keep it from booting.  Your design looks fine pending my assumptions, so it's up to you to find the connection issue where your schematic doesn't actually match your design <img src="./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" /><br /><br />EDIT:  One suggestion would be to simplify your design significantly, you don't need to switch the inputs to the '32, you can tie them directly to the '161's outputs because you don't care when it's in AxROM mode.  You only need to switch the outputs of the '32.  If you make that simplification you might rid yourself of your bug in the mean time, less complex means less room for mistakes.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Thanx for the hint, it helped a lot! <img src="./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" /> I switched only the outputs and now it works. I forgot to mention that i used a breadboard. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /> That's why i thought that it would be fine to switch the inputs too, because i thought that there would be less chances for the board to work in AOROM mode when the hc32 is &quot;totally floating&quot;. Anyway, i'm getting the same mirroring problem i got when i first tried the UNROM conversion. I tested it running Castlevania burned on a 512k AMD flash chip. When i connect CIRAM/A10 to A10 and A11 i'm getting a lot of graphic glitches and the the mirroring is so bad that the sectors of the stage overlap each other. But when i connect CIRAM/A10 to the pin 11 of the 161 (witch is switched on with the PRG D3 line), the graphic glitches disappear, it runs perfectly except for the overlapping thing that is definitely caused by bad mirroring. Any ideas what it could be?

Depending on the UxROM game you'll have to select between vertical or horizontal mirroring.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Sounds like you have a bad connection on CIRAM A10 to the '161 somewhere and the line is floating based on the fact that you're saying things 'glitches dissapear, but still has wrong mirroring' when you connect it to the D3 output of the '161.  <br /><br />Are you saying that when you bypass your switch (but still schematically the same) things clean up?  If so you just proved your switch bad, but you still have a different issue (probably the D4 input to the '161 since it sounds like it's not switching and sounds like you've got one NT mirroring, aka CIRAM A10 to GND/Vcc.)  <br /><br />In any event bread boards are notorious for causing issues with poor connections.  If you really must use it, check all the connections related to mirroring with a multimeter to try and verify good contact.

See the M 'mirror bit' in the <a href="http://wiki.nesdev.com/w/index.php/AxROM" class="postlink">wiki</a>. I thought you had a switch to go back and forth between D3 and D4 on that input to the '161.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Well if you went back to UNROM with 1943 and things are all glitched up it sounds like things are now getting worse.  Didn't UNROM work properly after you took my suggestion on the '32 inputs?  <br /><br />In any event really 'dirty' graphics glitches are usually indicative of a bad connection somewhere probably a floating line.  If the tiles are 'clean' but just the wrong tile or you can see the NES updating tiles on screen while you scroll you've probably got the wrong mirroring.  Sprites don't rely on mirroring, so those should be clean.  If they aren't you've certainly got a connection issue.  Since I'm guessing all those CHR-RAM connections are already made for you by the original board and there aren't bad traces then you might just have a dirty 72pin...

You just have to keep searching till you find your bad connection.  Could be anywhere with a breadboard especially.  Another method would be to just bypass ALL switches and get AxROM to work, then take one step at a time to add in the switches back in.
