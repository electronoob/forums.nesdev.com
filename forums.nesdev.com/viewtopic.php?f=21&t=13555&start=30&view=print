(Plus, most — if not all — generators don't do the blacks correctly at all: tweaking the brightness in the generator does zilch to the blacks from what I remember, when it should definitely do at least <em>something.</em> (Though it's been a while since I last messed with a web-based palette generator.))

My eyes are so tired of colors that if they could, they'd scream. x_x<br /><br />Of course, if I'd been able to get NESten to work on my laptop without encountering a Runtime Error, I'd have that one on there as well. Also LoopyNES and FWNES, but those're DOS-only, alas; they'll have to wait. (And if I weren't so tired, I'd right now be working on adding the 3DS and Wii/Wii U Virtual Console NES palettes that I heard someone ripped…)

Maniac Mansion is one game I've actually never played, so I didn't know about this. ò.O<br /><br />I guess I could make one for Bee 52, and then change my main 'Definitive' one to have a $1D that's the same color as $xE/$xF.<br /><br />Thank you for letting me know! <img src="./images/smilies/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt=":mrgreen:" title="Mr. Green" /> I'll roll that change out between twelve and eighteen hours from now<span style="font-size: 150%; line-height: normal">*</span>, probably. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />And in screenshot gallery-related news, I was able to get NESten, FWNES, and loopynes all working on my Windows 98 PC, and so now they have pages up on <a href="http://procyon.com/~kizul/nes_files/screenshot_gallery/" class="postlink">the screenshot gallery</a> as of a few minutes ago. (Sadly FWNES, loopynes, BioNES, and FCEUX all look nearly identical to each other. xD)<br /><br /><span style="font-size: 85%; line-height: normal">Unfortunately, I <em>did</em> end up having to use DOSBox to get a screenshot of loopynes running rainwarrior's palette.nes, because while I managed to get it to run — I was correct that it didn't seem to have a screenshot-saving option. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_neutral.gif" alt=":|" title="Neutral" /></span><br /><br />Ah well! <img src="./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /> Now all I have left to add are just the Nintendo VC palettes, the Nestopia YUV &quot;Consumer&quot; palette, and maybe the palette of &quot;REW&quot;, an interesting emulator that played Game Boy, Game Boy Color, and NES games. And possibly JNES in there somewhere.<br /><br /><span style="font-size: 150%; line-height: normal">*<strong>EDIT:</strong></span> <a href="http://procyon.com/~kizul/nes_files/Kizuls_Definitive_NTSC_NES_Master_Palette.zip" class="postlink">aaaaaaand that's done now</a>. I decided instead to make a separate palette for Maniac Mansion; it was simpler to create a single palette that would work better for (primarily) one single game. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_neutral.gif" alt=":|" title="Neutral" /><br /><br />I may look around my local used-games shops and see if I can get my hands on a copy of Maniac Mansion and rent it to see how it looks on my Control Deck; I'm curious how the blacks look on the real hardware. ò.O<br /><br />Meanwhile, I may <em>also</em> end up rooting through almost the entire NES ROM set to see how games use which blacks and where; just in the few I was testing of the games I already own, I noticed that Dragon Warrior uses $0D for the mouths of Red Slimes, and $0E for the dragon silhouette on the title screen (as well as monster shadows). Meanwhile, Dragon Warrior III (and most other NES games, it would seem) uses just $0F for black, whilst Dragon Warrior <em>IV</em> uses $0F for black — except during battles, where it uses $<span style="text-decoration: underline">3</span>F. (Lunar Pool also uses $3F for its main black, but the glowing Cue Ball flashes to $0E when it turns black.)<br /><br />This is <em>maddening.</em> <img src="./images/smilies/icon_neutral.gif" alt=":|" title="Neutral" /> But hey, at least some of us can agree: my palette looks a dang sight better than many <em>other</em> palettes out there! <img src="./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /> (Maybe not <em>all</em> of them, but <em>a lot</em> of them… <span style="font-size: 85%; line-height: normal">In <em>my</em> opinion, at least…</span>) It would seem that about the only <em>major</em> problems my palette has lie in (some of) the blacks! <img src="./images/smilies/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt=":mrgreen:" title="Mr. Green" /><br /><br /><span style="font-size: 150%; line-height: normal"><strong>EDIT 2:</strong></span> And, of course, because accidentally creating dead links all the time isn't enough, I ended up accidentally getting the two palettes switched around, so the special Maniac Mansion palette was <em>still broken</em> (technically). <img src="./images/smilies/icon_neutral.gif" alt=":|" title="Neutral" /> I just fixed it, though. &gt;.&gt;<br /><br /><span style="font-size: 150%; line-height: normal"><strong>EDIT 3:</strong></span> after much deliberation (and going through nearly the entire library of NTSC-U NES ROMs), I've decided to instead have a special palette for Bee 52, and rename the one that I'd made for Maniac Mansion so that the <em>Maniac Mansion-specific</em> palette is now the 'default' palette (and I've retroactively uploaded the Zip file into my older post). Apologies for the headaches, everyone. This will be my final edit, both to this post, and to this palette. :p

	</div><br /><br />I no longer have a real NES console or a CRT TV, so I can't check for myself. Assuming that this palette matches the behavior of correctly calibrated 1980s TVs, it strikes me as very strange that Nintendo chose such a purple hue ($22, I think) when $21 or $31 would look much better.

I don't think humans really have much ability to remember absolute colours with any kind of precision.<br /><br />There's no way you could remember the exact hue of the SMB sky without having thought a lot about it and made direct comparisons with other potentials, etc., which is what you might be doing now that you're looking at palette possibilities. You need a framework of reference to be able to recall colours that way.
