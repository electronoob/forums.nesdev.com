<strong>Mirroring means ignoring one or more signals on an address bus.</strong><br /><br />In the case of PPU registers, it means "the side of the PPU on the CPU bus ignores address lines A12 through A3" because those lines aren't even connected. You can simulate this behavior by having the emulated PPU pretend that these address lines are 0 even when they aren't; hence (Address AND #7).<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=9">tepples</a> — Thu Apr 30, 2009 8:10 am</p><hr />

Instead of writing to $2000, $2008, $2010, $2018, etc. Just write to $200x any time there is a write between $2000 and $3FFF. I'm not so studied up on my C/C++, so in a sort of basic code:<br /><br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">If &#40;Address &gt;= 0x2000&#41; AND &#40;Address &lt;=3FFF&#41;<br />     WriteTo&#40;&#40;Address AND #7&#41;&#41; + 0x2000&#41;<br />End If<br /></div><br /><br />If that makes any sense. On a read/write to that location, only pay attention to bits 0-2 and add $2000 to it. So if a piece of code tries to write to $3012, it will actually write to $2002 (well, it would actually read $2002 as you don't write to that register). I don't think that there actually is a memory location $2008, or $2010. I think it only reads bits 0-2 when writing to that address range. But I don't know much about that. The code above will effectively implement mirroring though.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=138">Celius</a> — Thu Apr 30, 2009 7:30 am</p><hr />

When I read :<br /><em>"2000h-2007h   Internal PPU Registers (mirrored to 2008h-3FFFh)"</em><br /><br />I interpreted as : <br />every time I write to 200x (x varying from 0 to 7) I also write to: <br />        <div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">while &#40;&#40;address + 0x08&#41; &lt;= 0x3FFF&#41; &#123;<br />            Memory.writeUnhandled&#40;address + 0x08, value&#41;;<br />            address += 8;<br />        &#125;<br /></div><br /><br />but i don't do  this on reverse, I mean when the cpu writes to address 2008.. I don't do nothing, must I need to do the same treatment?<br /><br />why or where the mirroring is used?<br />all mirroring works like how?<br /><br />thanks in advance<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=912">dreampeppers99</a> — Thu Apr 30, 2009 7:07 am</p><hr />
