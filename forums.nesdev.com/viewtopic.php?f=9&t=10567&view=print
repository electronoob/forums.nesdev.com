		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I built a dev cart out of an NES-TLROM-03 board (<a href="http://bootgod.dyndns.org:7777/profile.php?id=181" class="postlink">this one</a> in particular), but it doesn't seem to work and I'd like some help <br /><br />I removed the roms and replaced them with 28 pin sockets (from which I'd clipped pins 1, 22, and 27 to support rewiring). I then ran jumper wires as follows:<br /><br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">&nbsp; &nbsp;Board&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Socket<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;PRG&nbsp; &nbsp;32 Vcc&nbsp; &nbsp;29&nbsp; &nbsp;27 /WE<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;PRG&nbsp; &nbsp;27 A14&nbsp; &nbsp; 3&nbsp; &nbsp; 1 A14<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;PRG&nbsp; &nbsp;22 /CE&nbsp; &nbsp;24&nbsp; &nbsp;22 /OE<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;CHR&nbsp; &nbsp;32 Vcc&nbsp; &nbsp;29&nbsp; &nbsp;27 /W<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;CHR&nbsp; &nbsp;27 A14&nbsp; &nbsp; 3&nbsp; &nbsp; 1 A14<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;CHR&nbsp; &nbsp;22 /CE&nbsp; &nbsp;24&nbsp; &nbsp;22 /OE<br /></div><br />This should have tied the write enables high, and the output enable to chip enable, so that EEPROMs placed in the sockets would act like ROMs. It should also have fixed the A14 line.<br /><br />I loaded the PRG socket with an Atmel AT28C256 EEPROM and tried it out, but it didn't work. So I started checking connections with my meter. Even though pin 27 was clipped, there was still a connection between the socket and the board (due to the jumper wire going to pin 1). This would have the effect of pulling A14 high at all times. That shouldn't (AFAICT) have changed anything, but  I fixed it anyway. After removing the jumper wire and a lot of work sucking solder out of the hole, I finally managed to break the connection. To avoid remaking it, I ran the A14 jumper wire to a pad connected to the MMC3's A14 line instead.<br /><br />I didn't fix the CHR, which had the same problem, as it didn't have any chip loaded in it. It still didn't work, so I removed all the CHR jumper wires (just in case) and tried again, but it still didn't work.<br /><br />I don't have access to a proper EEPROM burner (I'm looking to remedy that soon), but I've hacked together an eight-bit jobbie and it seems to work. By pulling all the unused address lines high, I'm able to write one page to the top of the ram, which should end up mapped to $FF00-$FFFF. As one page NES programs are in short supply, I wrote one of my own (which you can download <a href="http://static.karatorian.org/hardware/nes/one-page.nes" class="postlink">here</a>.) All it does is change the background color to purple and turn on sprite rendering (so that the background color shows), but it ought to be enough to confirm that it's working.<br /><br />My NES is out of commission, so I've been testing on a cheap 72-pin famiclone. The only thing I can think of that would be an issue with using the clone is that it doesn't supply a full 5 volts, it only puts out 4.16 volts. The datasheet on my EEPROMs calls for a supply of 5 ± 10% volts, so it's slightly out of spec. I haven't tested whether the EEPROMs work when under-supplied.<br /><br />At this point, I can't figure out what's wrong. Four possibilities come to mind:<br /><br /><ul><li> Something is wrong with my rewiring.</li><li> <s>The EEPROMs don&#39;t like the clone&#39;s under voltage.</s></li><li> The MMC3 doesn't function with the CHR missing.</li><li> <s>My test program doesn&#39;t work on real hardware.</s></li><li> <s>Despite appearances, my hacky EEPROM burner doesn&#39;t work.</s></li></ul><br />Here's some pictures if you think it'll help:<br /><br /><ul><li> <a href="http://static.karatorian.org/hardware/nes/tlrom-dev-front.jpg" class="postlink">Board Front</a></li><li> <a href="http://static.karatorian.org/hardware/nes/tlrom-dev-back.jpg" class="postlink">Board Back</a></li><li> <a href="http://static.karatorian.org/hardware/programmer/prototype-1.jpg" class="postlink">EEPROM Burner</a></li></ul><br />Would anyone with a MMC3 dev board be willing to test out the little ROM I made? Does anyone have any suggestions for troubleshooting?

(and then at 3.3V). It worked fine at 4.1V, and provided entertaining glitches from CHR being too slow at the lower voltage, so it's not that either.<br /><br />Hope that helps...

I don't know what was wrong with it, but it didn't work for me. It'd flake out somewhere in the CHR-ROM, and trash a little of the program to make it not work. At least that's what I remember.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Thanks a bunch lidnariq for messing about with hardware for me. My &quot;bench supply&quot; is a hacked PC power supply, so I don't have the option to put out arbitrary voltages. (I should probably hack up something to fix that.) You've eliminated two of the potential issues, so I can concentrate on the rest. I figured that little test program would run work, but without a dev cart, I had no way to be sure. I was rather worried that the low voltage was the issue (as it'd mean my cart would be useless to me, even if built properly), so it's nice to have that eliminated.<br /><br />The more I think about it, I rather doubt that the MMC3 really cares whether the CHR is there or not. Which leaves my rewire job or the burner. The burner seems to work, but the only hardware I have to read memory chips is the burner itself. If I've got some address or data lines crossed, it'd appear to work, but the actual data written would be garbled. But I think the wiring is more likely the problem. At this point I'm wondering if the problem is that what I was trying to do isn't correct or whether my implementation is flawed.<br /><br />I suppose it's probably difficult to tell exactly what I did or was trying to do from the description in the first post. I'm thinking about making some schematics, which might make things clearer.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">3gengames wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">Did you split the ROM with ReadNES3, my NES rom splitter?</div><br />I didn't use any ROM splitter. I used a modified version of my ld56 linker script that output the last page as a raw binary. If I where to split an arbitrary ROM image, I'd probably just use dd.

There's probably enough of the pins left to solder some wires onto, but it'd be a pretty messy hack.

Why didn't I think of that? I'll keep it in mind as I investigate.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I was able to solder leads onto the PRG rom I clipped off the donor board and read back the correct data, so I've ruled out my EEPROM programming setup as the problem. Must still be something wrong with my wiring.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">infiniteneslives wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">I've found that it's actually required to tie /CE to ground for most EPROMs due to timing issues.  Not doing so often results in graphics glitches interestingly enough.</div><br />That makes it sound like it's fast enough for the CPU's clock speed, but not for the PPU's higher rate. Either way, it makes sense to me to ground it. So that's what I've done.<br /><br />My current rewiring setup is as follows:<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">Socket&nbsp; 1 A14&nbsp; --&gt;&nbsp; MMC3 A14<br />Socket 20 /CE&nbsp; --&gt;&nbsp; GND<br />Socket 27 /WE&nbsp; --&gt; +5V <br /></div><br />Which I just realized is wrong, because it leaves the EEPROM's /OE line tied to A16. I'll go fix that and see if it works.<br /><br /><strong>Edit:</strong> I rewired the entire PRG side of the board. This time I cut some traces so I didn't have to deal with clipping or lifting pins and the rewire job was much cleaner. After a few missteps, I finally got it working. Thanks for all the help and suggestions.<br /><br />P.S. This whole experience has made me realize three things: Donor boards are not convenient, neither are socketed EEPROMs, and, I need a desoldering gun.
