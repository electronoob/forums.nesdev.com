<br />However don't take word of this as it, there may be differences, especially for board with weird names (like SL1ROM, etc...)
<br />
<br />Anyway the pinout of both mappers and FC cart connector is known, so you can just verify it with a beeping ohm meter yourself.

<br />
<br />The pinouts on official boards are the same, 3rd party boards aren't. I've made repros on famicom boards--only times I had to figure out pinouts were 3rd party boards. Do remember that the famicom chr and prg roms are on opposite sides of the circuit board.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I got an extra Olympus no tatakai for cheap yesterday (my original one was not working properly sometime). I was hoping to be able to use the old one as a test dev board since the english one was using an MMC1. After searching on the net, they used an UNROM instead... So it seems some game when they were ported were changed mappers in the US. I'm learning new things everyday, yay! (...)  Oh well. I don't mind to have a spare cart for the price I paid anyway.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Yes, this is also the case for at least Dragon Quest, Dragon Quest II and Maniac Mansion. For Contra it's the other way arround: The US version uses UNROM while the japanese version uses a more advanced mapper.
<br />I bet all non-Nintendo made board have standard EPROM compataible pinout, but maybe that's not the case. Konami could be evil enough to have swapped pinout as well, but I guess most other third-parties are safe (or just not rich enough to afford custom-made mask-ROMs).

<br />
<br />I don't think I knew some games made mapper upgrades, but that makes sense. Most of the mapper changes I could think of were 3rd party mappers to nintendo mappers like Tiny Toons 1 &amp; 2 and Rolling Thunder.
