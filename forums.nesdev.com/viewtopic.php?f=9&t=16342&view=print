		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />This kind of troubleshoot tends to be a little time consuming, since it can be anything: from an electrolytic or decoupling capacitor to an IC or a bad soldering doing a short.<br />I would suggest you to look to things that get hot, but seems you already have looked at the ICs...<br />I once had a problem just like this on a NES clone, and after removing almost all ICs I found it was the RF modulator. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_evil.gif" alt=":evil:" title="Evil or Very Mad" /><br /><br />Edit: I just remembered a nice trick!!<br />You don't need to desolder the whole IC in this case, just take the soldering out of the Vcc or GND pin.<br />Make sure the pin is not touching the board. Check with the continuity test.<br />It's kind of tricky, but it's a lot faster than removing all of the IC's pins!!<br />It also works with any kind of componnent, not just ICs.

If you came pass by ours, I'd gladly help solve the problem but I don't think it's possible for you.<br /><br />In those case you should visually analize the board, solders and everything. If all else fails, just insert several amperes between VCC and GND and the short-circuit should melt by itself. In cases where a tiny wire of copper causes a short, this is a life-saver trick.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />A very tedious but workable method to find a short is to measure the resistance at different parts of the board (on the chips). If you meter is accurate enough and has enough resolution the closer you get to the short the lower the resistance gets.<br /><br />edit: I dont recommend disconnecting the power/ground on chips and not removing the whole chip. This way the chip might get powered through an i/o pin and that's bad news(tm)

It is not guaranteed to work, but it can work if the short is caused by a tiny hair of metal.<br />If it fails, you can still see which part heats and this is where the short circuit is.<br /><br />And there is nothing paranoid about not wanting to use +30V on chips supposed to be powered in +5V, this would burn them quickly in smoke.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Another part you might want to check that fails often is the bridge rectifier. I believe it resides in the RF modulator which might be why you didn't notice it getting hot.<br /><br />edit: found a pic, its the part labeled D4 (upside down) <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://i48.tinypic.com/4tprmr.jpg">http://i48.tinypic.com/4tprmr.jpg</a><!-- m --><br /><br />edit2: just thinking some more, but the bridge rectifier sits before the 7805, so that wouldn't explain why the 7805 is getting so hot. Stil a good idea to check it though.

Check cartridge connectors, especially pin 1 and 31 (its GND and +5V and they're opposite themselves) - if they were bent to make better contact, they might short if no cartridge is present<br />2. RAM memories might be shorted<br />3. CPU or PPU might be shorted<br />4. 74HC368 might be shorted<br />5. Something inside metal box with  modulator might be shorted<br /><br />During repairing tens of famiclones, no other chips were cause of any problems.<br /><br />BTW. Famicom does not have bridge rectifier.

Do not power it up like this.<br /><br />If a chip has been verified to not be the culprit you can use some solder to rebridge the pins on the chip. <br /><br />Downside is that this is a bit of a destructive process.<br /><br />edit: check if its not something like a capacitor first though.
