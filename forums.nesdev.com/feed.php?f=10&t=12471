The MMC5 (being the only one that with extra audio that was released outside of Japan) still has the sound-generating hardware, so an option in a menu is a fine way to handle it.<br /><br />That said, when I'm playing games, I find myself sometimes wanting to replace the in-game soundtrack with my own music instead but keep the sound effects because are useful for audio cues.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3512">lidnariq</a> — Tue Mar 17, 2015 7:43 pm</p><hr />

Alright. What do I need for the audio? And is it possible to run my game while it's using audio on a hardware that doesn't have it? I mean, I want to make in the Options menu that the user can choose whether they want to use the extra channels for sound effects in order to not interrupt the music or shall they want to use the internal APU channels. On NES, extra channels won't play, but on Famicom, as much as I figured, they will.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=6924">8bitMicroGuy</a> — Tue Mar 17, 2015 7:30 pm</p><hr />

You are correct, it <em>is </em>really complicated :<br /><br /><ul><li> <strong>Famicom </strong>: Released in 1983 in Japan. First &quot;Famicom-compatible&quot; console, uses 60-pin cartridges, toploading, has this very nice white and purple colours, has hardwired controllers (but also a slot for attachable ones). Only RF output.</li><li> <strong>NES </strong>: Released in 1985 in USA, 86 in western Europe, australia and a few asian countries. Completely redesigned console, the electronics are almost the same as Famicom, but it uses 72-pin cartidges, is front-loading, has a grey colour and attachable controllers. Has both RF and AV output. Has the CIC lockout chips.</li><li> <strong>Famicom AV</strong> : Redesign of the Famicom released in 199? in Japan, accepts 60-pin cartridges also white and purple colour, but is smaller, lighter, better looking, and has only AV output.</li><li> <strong>NES2 </strong>: Re-released in the USA only it looks almost identical to Famicom AV (and thus doesn't look like the original NES at all). Also white and purple colouring, but accepts 72-pin cartridges (obviously), and curiously, lacks the CIC lockout chip and also lacks AV output (RF only).</li><li> <strong>Famiclones </strong>: Not made by Nintendo, released all around the world (most of the time illegally), they were the only NES/FC-compatible consoles available in many countries such as China, USSR and satellite countries. They also exist in countries where the NES was released officially though. Comes in all kind of shapes and colours, quality and compatibility with cartridges/games/software/controllers/TVs varies a lot. It was not rare to see them comping with 60-pin XXXX-in-1 cartridges containing pirated games. They are still made today, since 2005 the NES patents expired so they are legal to make and sell in all countries.</li></ul><p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=38">Bregalad</a> — Tue Mar 17, 2015 6:27 am</p><hr />

All I've had as a child when playing the little SMB game was a PSX-like clone of NES with a game selection screen saying over 9000 in 1 *paraphrased*.

There aren't that many, and most of them are japanese only. The most common 72-pin MMC5 carts are probably Castlevania III and Laser Invasion. Castlevania III is usually very expensive, because it's Castlevania. All of them should have desolderable chips, but you should click each game to see the rest of the board configurations, because they have varying amounts of RAM and so on, and it would be easier for you if you picked something that was close to the configuration you want, so you don't have to mod the board much.<br /><br />EDIT: I checked ebay and it seems that the only MMC5 72-pin game that isn't ridiculously expensive is Laser Invasion. The bad news is that it has no WRAM, so you'd have to hack that in. The famicom games are generally more accessible, so you maybe you should consider getting one of them, along with an adapter. Or buy a Famicom (the A/V model is a great console to have) instead of an NES, but that will obviously be NTSC.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=95">tokumaru</a> — Sat Mar 14, 2015 7:02 pm</p><hr />

At my local game store, you can get an original Xbox and a Gamecube for $15, or an SNES for $60 (and SNES's are obviously not rare). Xbox 360s and PS3's are only $100, so it's a bit funny that hardware made in 1990 is being sold at over half the price as hardware being released about 10 years ago.
