I would also like to know how these 2600 cart cases were produced. I suppose Ronen at videogame wiz should know, since they're selling them.<br /><br />Otherwise, I agree with Kevin. Making grand plans about mass-production of new NES carts is just silly when we have yet to see a homebrewn NES game of good enough quality that more than 100 carts could be sold. And the few nostalgics that won't settle for playing a new homebrewn game in an emulator probably won't mind spending $50 or more on it anyway.<br /><br />I too would really like to see the lockout chip get 0wn3d, but no one in their right mind should believe that the lockout chip is what's keeping people from making NES games today. The real reason is that there aren't many people in this world that will devote the time needed to make a big NES game just for the fun of it. Most big homebrewn-game projects get terminated before they reach halfway. The ones that do get finished are smaller games, where the author had more realistic goals for his hobby project.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=106">Bananmos</a> — Sat Apr 08, 2006 11:27 am</p><hr />

Wasn't the unauthorized cart pretty rampant with the 2600 anyway?

Also remember that Atari carts are tiny compared to NES ones, the cart shell and the board.  And they only need one memory chip (and a logic chip).  Compared to NES NROM carts that need 2 memories and some illogic (lockout <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /> ).<br /><br />Which doesn't make the prototyping cheaper, but does make it easier to make a bunch of them at once.  NES ones will just cost a little more (which is a little multiplied by some crazy quantity for the builder, it becomes a lot).<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=10">Memblers</a> — Fri Apr 07, 2006 7:14 am</p><hr />

You'd need to click off alot of cases to make that up... especially if you take into account how much money it'd save to use existing cases.  You might be able to buy NES carts for $3 in bulk, while cases might cost $2.50 to get made.  That means you have to amortize your $10K over 20K carts to just break even.

You're looking at $10K or more for custom molds.  This is way outside the realm of possibility for most hobbiests.<br /><br />Also, most carts will be a run of 100 carts or less.  This is a drop in the bucket.  There's thousands and thousands of SMB/DH and SMD/DH/WTM carts kicking around that no one wants.  And contrary to popular belief, it is easy to re-use the glop top lockout chip, just use some wire cutters and cut the board off leaving just the lockout chip.  You can then solder it to the edge of your board with 6 connections.  No muss, no fuss.<br /><br />Anyways, better people than us have tried to defeat the lockout circuit, and every one of them has failed.  Atari was on the cusp of victory, however, when their lawyers snagged the 10NES code... making alot of the work they did moot.<br /><br />Today we have some fairly powerful computing at our fingertips, so some kind of brute force attack *might* be possible.  I can record gigs and gigs of data if someone wants it, but without someone to process it and apply some good cryptographic knowledge to it, we're sunk.<br /><br />I highly doubt if I dump 20 gigs of data (using my simple delta modulation scheme to pack the data down 300 fold or so) I seriously doubt we will see a repeat of the data stream.  I could set an FPGA up to look for a data stream repeat, but IMO I think we'll be waiting months or more before it repeats.  If it's more than 64 or so bits, we won't see it repeating in our lifetimes probably.<br /><br />Again, I could set an FPGA up to dump the data in realtime, or possibly faster than realtime, but I need somewhere to stuff it to make it workable.  If I fill up a 400 gig HD with nothing but lockout chip data, it may not tell us anything useful even then.<br /><br />I am fairly serious about cracking the chip, but I'm only good for the "back end" of the affair, that is, supplying the data for others to work on.  I have absolutely no experience cracking any cryptographic functions.<br /><br />I'm sure if we show the right people some frequency distribution patterns of the data (which have been generated before) they MIGHT be able to shed at least a little light on the situation.  A true "cryptographically secure" algo would not have the curious frequency distrubution we have seen, and it would instead have a very even one.  Our data definitely does not look like a gaussian noise source, so there are some very very important clues that I just don't know how to interpret.<br /><br />Anyone got clues who we can talk to to get the ball rolling on some good crypto doods?<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=230">kevtris</a> — Tue Apr 04, 2006 5:52 pm</p><hr />
