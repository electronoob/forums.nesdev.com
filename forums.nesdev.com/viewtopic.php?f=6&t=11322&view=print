		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />So here is a project that I've been working on.<br />  It's a SNROM version of VegaPlay. With a 256KB flash you can load 7 non-banking  NSFs &lt;32K (you lose the vector table and trampoline bytes from each 32K 'slot'. One 32K 'slot' is used for reset code and CHR data that's banked out after reset.). <br /> The runtime is loaded into WRAM during reset, leaving the PRG space for NSFs. <s>The testing I&#39;ve done so far: works with FamiTracker NSFs but can have strange behavior with other NSF Players.</s> I use Nestopia so can't speak for other EMUs. <br />  I've tried to simplify the loading and compiling process, you don't need to strip the header from the NSFs and there is a User Configure file to do all the editing in, so the main ASM file can be left alone.<br />  Just drop all your NSFs into the build folder, edit User Configure with the NSF titles and load addresses and run the compile bat. It will spit out a .NES and/or a .PRG ready to flash.<br /> With a compiler switch you can use the normal playback timing based on the NMI or use Sync pulses on controller 2 (this is based on FamiSlayer v6.66 by Heavyw8bit). I'm working on a cheap (16F628 based) Midi Clock to NES Sync24 converter. Testing a proto board, so both the HW and the NES rom could change as things progress.<br /> These preview ROMs are NSFs from the FamiMiniCompo10, the User Configure.asm has the title info. <s>NSF 1, 3 and 4 have strange behavior, plays for a short time then triggers a bankswitch. Still testing <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":&#41;" title="Smile" /></s><br />  The Pad1 controls:<br />Up/Down - song # (all these are single song NSFs so trying to run a song other than the first will crash it)<br />Left/Right - cycle thru the 7 NSFs<br />Start Button - Start/Stop playback<br /><br />UPDATE 7/20/2014:<br />Added a preview rom with a fixed Read routines. No more strange behavior, at least from the NES <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://www.dropbox.com/sh/g6osy6uozookrng/AACKkVhjdeRg3Xe-yjh_7WJUa">https://www.dropbox.com/sh/g6osy6uozook ... -yjh_7WJUa</a><!-- m --><br />Yogi

The main thing I wanted was a 'no fuss' tool to put music on real hardware. <br /> I haven't changed the UI very much so there is lots of room there for improvement, but OTH I'm considering turning the PPU off during playback for the best sync timing. I'm finishing up a HW Midi Clock to Sync24 interface and after some testing will know how much NMI calls affect the playback.<br />Yogi

Does sound like the glitches I have observed; a random advance to the next NSF ( = to a 'Right' button press on controller 1). The odd thing, in my case, is I have the glitches testing on Nestopia (haven't tested on real HW yet) and the the same NSFs have the glitch when played  via the NMI or via the 'SlayerSync' variable timing, which so far amounts to me banging controller 2's trigger button to advance the Frame plays at a very slow rate. <br />   The Frame at which the glitch occurs ( through different for each of the troubled roms) seems to be fixed, regardless of the timing; so leads me to conclude the the trigger is associated with a particular Frame's actions. A false controller read due to a DPCM could account for the behavior but I doubt that Nestopia emulates the hardware this closely. <br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"> My project is play VRC6 songs on real hardware.

If you want a robust approach, read the controller multiple times. People often say to read multiple times until you get matching reads, but it may be theoretically possible that two consecutive reads get corrupted. In the thread you linked there's a routine by blargg that always reads the controller 4 times and should never fail (IIRC it can guarantee this because of the timing of the routine).<br /><br />EDIT: I realized (thanks to rainwarrior at #nesdev) that it shouldn't be possible for two consecutive reads to get corrupted if the reading routine is sufficiently fast enough. From a quick look at blargg's code it seems like it reads 4 times only because there's a chance that the button state may change inbetween the reads. But I didn't look further into it.

(I believe the &quot;A&quot; button can be read without DPCM interference.)

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />It might be a timing difference ultimately resulting from  a difference in PPU/CPU alignment between the Famicom and NES. Anything that affects PPU/CPU alignment is likely to affect 6502/APU alignment within the CPU because normally, the program running on the 6502 waits for the PPU to warm up before doing anything. I know the PPU reset line isn't connected one way on the front-loading NES and the other way on the Famicom and top-loading NES.
