		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Finally got around to playing the first batch of submissions. Excellent games!
<br />
<br />People say that it's easier to make a good (commercial quality) game for an 8-bit console than for newer systems. I don't think it's as much because of the technical limitations of an 8-bit system, but because the game industry in general wasn't as experienced back then.
<br /><strong>Lan Master</strong> and <strong>Lawn Mower</strong> prove this in a way. I am amazed by the quality of their music and graphics, it's a lot better than that of other NROM games I know. And both games are fun, too. Good job, Shiru!
<br />
<br /><strong>Forehead Block Guy</strong>
<br />The background collision glitches and dodgy physics made playing it a little frustrating, but it's a cool and fun concept. Dunno if there was any fix posted, all my roms are from June 5th.
<br />
<br /><strong>Slappin' Bitches</strong>
<br />My thumb died. I was a dirty cheater and enabled auto-fire eventually. I like how the music gets more intense as you go. There seems to be some strategy involved(?) to get most kills with a given wall integrity, but I found the game to be most enjoyable when I set it to 001 and just shot down tanks until the first one got me. Maybe re-balancing tank hit points and adding more unexpected events/different enemies that require fast reaction would make gameplay more diverse.
<br />
<br /><strong>thwaite</strong>
<br />Couldn't get very far, but loved it. The houses and people fleeing from them made me smile. It's a nice detail.
<br />
<br /><strong>Panesian Power</strong>
<br />Not sure what to say about this one. I remember discussing with a few people about how the NES needs more sexy treatment, heheh. Bunnyboy made it happen!
<br />I lost motivation after the first level, you can blame the internet and its abundance of true-color sexy pics for that. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" />
<br />
<br />
<br />I have yet to try Memblers's and Denine's entries.

<br />However, just played again and got to Mon 4:00. I tried to shoot all missiles on my first attempts so the "wreckage" tip helped a good deal.

<br />
<br />Super Bat Puncher Demo is good too but this is a demo version hopefully the full version would fix some things such as adding timed mode and fix the continue option, and more levels.
<br />
<br />I have other ideas and stuff too but at this time I will not type it right now.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />So recently I was contacted by one of the editors of <a href="http://www.infendo.com/" class="postlink">http://www.infendo.com/</a> (Blake).
<br />
<br />He asked if I could send one of my controllers for a review on his site and asked that I send an emulator and games with it.  Normally I deny requests to send games with my products for obvious copyright issues.  But after a few seconds it dawned on me that I could send him some homebrews!
<br />
<br />I'm sending the controller out today with the updated games from this competition and a few other homebrew favorites of mine including NES virus cleaner and Dpad hero.
<br />
<br />I guess what I'm asking is if you guys are okay with this.  I can tell him not to mention anything about the homebrews in the review if that's what you guys would like.  But I figured you all would like the publicity and since you're all freely sharing your work it wouldn't matter much.
<br />
<br />For what it's worth I did include all the blurbs and plan to inform him of the compo and the roms I sent.  
<br />
<br />If by chance he's interested in the games and expresses interest on doing a review of homebrew gaming would everyone involved be supportive?
<br />
<br />I want to make sure I'm not stepping on anyone's toes.  I can guess that you all would like to get your work out there as much as possible but I don't want to offend with improper assumptions.
<br />
<br />Once again, great work on all these games guys!  Looking forward to the multicart!

<br />Um...I don't know if he'l be writing about NROM category only, but... If you\he can't wait then please ask him to do not write about Melanchony Of Existance.
<br />Melanchony Of Existance is badly written and can make NES homebrews look as "poor" for some people, because of MOE bugs and collisions problems.
<br />There will be Full version soon.But if ou\he can't wait then please don't mention MOE.
