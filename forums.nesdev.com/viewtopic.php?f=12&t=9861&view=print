		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I recently built a homemade SNES Cartridge reader using MCP23017 expander chips for the Raspberry Pi:<br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://familab.org/blog/2012/12/snes-su">http://familab.org/blog/2012/12/snes-su</a><!-- m --> ... ed-system/<br /><br />I have broken out the IO from the center 46-pin connector, and have read write access to all of the lines with the exception of the CIC pins.<br /><br />I am aware that the CIC lock is needed for SA1 games. I have the desire to use the Super CIC lock chip, but I have no idea how it will behave outside of an actual SNES. Does the SNES provide the Super CIC with a clock source I'd have to emulate outside of the console? Anyone with experience would be greatly appreciated! <img src="./images/smilies/icon_cool.gif" alt="8-)" title="Cool" />

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />It theory it should be possible but I think that the SA-1 would also require certain clock signal from the SNES in order to unlock. I do not think it will only be a matter of hooking up the SuperCIC to the cart. I remember talking to the guy behind the Retrode about implementing the SuperCIC in his future hardware revision and he told me he couldn't manage it even after exchanging a few e-mail with Ikari.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Is that SuperCIC able to act as both Lock and Key? In cartridges you'd need a &quot;key&quot;, but in your case you'd need a &quot;lock&quot;.<br /><br />And, theoretically, you might be able to dump those carts without a CIC. What I mean is:<br /><br />The cartridge and console CICs are microprocessors, exchanging data with each other, and drag P10=LOW if the exchanged data is wrong.<br /><br />Now, if you don't supply the 3.072MHz clock to the CIC, then the CIC can't run, can't exchange any data, can't sense errors, and can't drag P10=LOW on errors.<br /><br />Only problem might be that the CIC might initially set P10=LOW on power up, in that case you could try to let it run for a couple of clock cycles (so it can initialize P10=HIGH) and then stop the clock (before it gets a chance to verify exchanged data). Somehow like so:<br />-  Issue a short HIGH pulse on SNES.Cart.Pin25 to reset the CIC<br />-  Issue some dozens (or maybe some hundreds) clocks on SNES.Cart.Pin56<br /><br />The goal would be to get P10=HIGH (pin9 on a 16-pin DIP-package CIC chip). If you reach that state (best test that with a regular SNES cartridge), then it should be theoretically also working with SA-1 cartridges (assuming that they do internally use a signal similar to the P10 pin).<br /><br />Don't know if that's really working, but maybe worth a try. Oh, and one caution: I am not sure if the above P10 levels are correct (after gazing at my docs... I am almost sure that they are inverse of what I've said above).<br />PS. Some overview on what is happening in CICs: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://nocash.emubase.de/fullsnes.htm#snescartridgeciclockoutchip">http://nocash.emubase.de/fullsnes.htm#s ... ockoutchip</a><!-- m -->

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Just noting that the CIC is inside the SA-1 on these carts, and it has a lot of added protections like not falling for key+key=disable CIC. It may not be so simple to trick it.<br /><br />I am genuinely curious how people dumped SA-1 games in the past. I use a SuperCIC-modded SNES, myself. I presume people were dumping the ROM chips directly after removing them from the game boards?

But otherwise the SA-1 boards have standard pinouts so it wouldn't be too unlikely someone might have removed them to dump them directly.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Well again, I'm just recalling something from long ago. You say you too remember something for dumping &quot;special&quot; carts. Perhaps that was it. It's not too far fetched that to dump SA-1 games someone would have just removed the chips and directly read them with a programming device. The pinout is standard I believe.

The best bet for dumping is to remove the DX2 from the SNES, play the SA-1 game for a number of minutes, switch off the machine (holding reset at the same time). Place the DX2 back on the SNES with the SA-1 cart in the cart slot. Switch SNES on dump ROM via parallel port. Didn't work every time, (some SA-1 carts seemed more problematic than others)
