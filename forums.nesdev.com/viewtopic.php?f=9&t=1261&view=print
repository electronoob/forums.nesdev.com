<br />but with memblers I think it's still under some design phase(?)
<br />and then we have the FunkyFlashCart that we're waiting for some status on too <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />
<br />
<br />that's what I "know"... but I think it's better that the creators them self answear this question instead of my speculations

<br />Yeah I know I've said it's almost ready before, but the past few days I've had actual chips and stuff arriving, the expensive ones that I saved for buying last. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />
<br />
<br />But, I've got some other stuff to do next week.  I started throwing together a webpage with prices and all that stuff, it still needs to be finished.  I'll be able to start shipping some stuff in April.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />What is needed is a RAM based FunkyFlashCart that can be programmed from CopyNES.  That would effectively be a true NES copier.  It could dump games, as well as play backup images without the original cart.  Of course, the copier would have to be tethered to a PC or laptop for loading games, but the Nano-ITX looks like it could do the job, as it even has a TV-out.  You could hook both NES and Nano-ITX to your TV at the same time, and control the entire setup with a universal remote.  Though some custom game and save management software would have to be written, to make controller via a remote easier.  Then just select the game and save you want to load, then switch the TV-input line from the Nano-ITX to the NES using the remote.

And if it came with a usb/similar connection, and didn't require any assembly at all, I'd buy it asap. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />
