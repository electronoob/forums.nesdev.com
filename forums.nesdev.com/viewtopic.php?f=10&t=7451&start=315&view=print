		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Super Mario Bros. decodes 16x208-pixel slices of the map to a 13-byte-long column buffer, where each byte represents one metatile. It passes this column to the screen drawing code (which prepares packets to be sent to the nametables), and then it copies the column to a 32x13-metatile buffer that holds a sliding window on the decoded map. One way you could use the data in such a window would be to give each metatile some properties, such as whether it can be walked through, and then use that map in your collision code.

And, then, most tiles you won't be able to put because of color differences, and it'll take 4x more memory to do it probably, because it's 4x more tiles. I think 16x16 tiles should be used pretty much always, unless you use MMC5 and can get single colored tiles. But even then it may be a waste. It'd certainly be waste of a mapper.

What doesn't make sense is not using any kind of compression (larger blocks, RLE, anything), because each screen would take an insane amount of ROM (with NROM you'd hardly be able to store more than 16 screens).
<br />
<br />Working with bigger blocks sure makes the levels more compact, and easier to handle because there's less data to work with. On the NES, 32x32-pixel blocks are particularly interesting, because that's the size of the area affected by each attribute byte.

Two types are mandatory: "empty" and "solid", and you have 2 left to choose from "water", "lava" (or anything that hurts), "platform" (only solid at the top), "conveyor belt", and so on.

<br />Attribute bytes select which palettes are used for the background tiles. Each byte defines the 4 palettes used in a 32x32-pixel area, one palette for each 16x16-pixel area. The good thing about using 32x32-pixel blocks is that you don't have to do any sort of attribute byte manipulation, you can just copy attribute bytes straight to the attribute tables (as long as you don't scroll vertically).
