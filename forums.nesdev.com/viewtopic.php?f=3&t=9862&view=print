I would find this much more useful than the existing .FDS format.<br /><br />Furthermore, in such case the FDS BIOS could be loaded as a normal ROM image and then you select the disk; if you select the disk image file directly then it automatically started instead.<br /><br />Separate program could be made to convert the file formats between FDS and QDI.

There are tools for manipulating .FDS files but I'm just too lazy ATM to find them out. We just need emulators to support it, like, say, it can recognise GAME_A.FDS and GAME_B.FDS as two sides of the same game, and as long as you load another image the emulator should not consider a new game being loaded and restart the machine. The latter is actually quite important, as it would make using say those graphics/disk editors easier. As most emulators will reset when a new image is loaded (or what it seemed to be when I last tried, which was a while ago), to use such tools you need to make a new disk image by putting the tool on the first side and the target to edit on the second, which is quite annoying.

I think the benefits do far outweigh the confusion it might cause, although I mean to have the emulator support .QDI in addition to .FDS, rather than requiring all games to be available in .QDI (you can convert if necessary between the formats), and some homebrew software made for save file editing and various other purposes, might be more useful in .QDI even though not all might be so.<br /><br />My format is also useful just if you want more precision in the operation of the emulation, and to test the BIOS and other features, and so on.

It seems to me what you want is an emulator that will let you specify which disk/side to insert and when, and possibly will let you switch to another disk file without restarting. I don't think any of that requires a new format, just a change to the emulator.

You don't have to go out and license a separate operating system to run Windows-only apps that don't work in Wine, and you don't have to go out and buy a separate computer to run Mac OS X-only apps whose author is unwilling to port them to GNUstep. That's one part of why I made a <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/viewtopic.php?f=22&amp;t=9119" class="postlink">background graphics editor that runs on an NES</a>: it was easier at the time than learning native application development for another platform.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">and benefit from the additional processing power, input methods (e.g. a mouse)</div><br />Infiniteneslives built me an adapter to connect the Super NES mouse to an NES, and I remember you added support for it to Nintendulator. The mouse driver already in <a href="http://pineight.com/nes/#thwaite" class="postlink">Thwaite</a> would work on an AV Famicom, and with some software changes (D1 instead of D0), the mouse through a similar adapter would work on the original Famicom as well. Or an editor could support the protocol used by Famiclone mice.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">display resolution</div><br />Double-edged sword. Run it on the authentic console and you get authentic NTSC filtering for free. That's the other reason I made my graphics editor: I was tired of having to edit tiles and the palette, copy to CF, insert into PowerPak, test, eject CF, and repeat, just to make sure they still look legible on a TV.<br /><br /><br /><span style="font-size: 83%; line-height: normal">[1] Or aliases or symlinks or whatever your preferred OS calls them.</span>

If you want to play with a disk editor, drop shortcuts[1] to the sides that you want to edit into the folder.</div>Actually I don't think it is such a good idea to only allow switching in a particular folder; you should be allowed to enter any filename. However, you could still have it to select the same directory as the currently loaded file by default, or have shortcut keys for files in the same directory.<br /><br />You could also have the &quot;insert disk from file&quot; function (separate from the &quot;load ROM&quot; function, with also allows selecting .QDI and .FDS, but reboots once selected and always selects the bootable side from a .FDS) to allow selecting .QDI or .FDS, and selecting a .FDS from such menu would ask the initial side and then enable the keys to switch sides (until another file is selected).<br /><br />Using this .QDI also allows write protecting individual sides simply by using the mechanism for such thing which is available in the operating system (the emulated game would get bit2 of $4032 set). You could also use this .QDI to be able to make the emulator and the games (and even the BIOS, including custom BIOS replacements) to test CRC errors and some other features (although battery low would not be part of the disks and instead may be a command in the emulator to set battery low bit).
