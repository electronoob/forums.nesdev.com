That could end up being well over 100KB, but would eliminate the need for complex math: for each on-screen pixel, you'd add the relative coordinates to the player's position and use the result to read a color from the map, which may use tiling to save space;<br /><br />- Objects/sprites would be drawn exactly like in a raycaster, possibly using logarithmic division and an arctangent look-up table to find the horizontal position of on-screen objects, and a multiplication is used to calculate their distances, and from that, their size.

I think we had discussed this idea, or a similar one for raycasting a while back.<br /><br />If I took a stab at it, I would do polygons with XOR filling in a window centered in the screen. My thought is that a wireframe racer would be doable; adding XOR filling could just be a step beyond (it's not always that simple to add filling, but if we assume just a single flat road, it should be rather simple). I wouldn't try to have too much detail on the road itself to increase frame rate. Could be pretty decent, or pretty terrible.

Using a lower resolution not only makes things easier to display on the NES, but it also reduces the amount of calculations you have to do in order to render a scene and the amount of data that has to be transferred to VRAM. 4x4 software pixels would look like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nw3OL4-tw4" class="postlink">the second video Chris posted</a>, which is more than acceptable considering it's the NES doing it in software. Drawing interesting tracks using only 4 colors would be a challenge, though... more colors could be simulated with dithering, but then the combinations won't fit in 256 tiles anymore. Maybe the maps can be designed to not have more than 4 colors visible at a time, so the palette could change on the fly.<br /><br />I feel like a higher frame rate is more important then resolution in a game like this, and since this is the NES we're talking about, there will have to be compromises.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">dougeff wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">my idea of having rendering off for 50% of the frame to write 240 tiles worth...3840 writes, over 4 frames is 960 writes per frame...is a bit crazy.</div><br />The problem is not so much transferring that data to the PPU, but calculating those 4KB of data. You most likely won't get a playable frame rate if you need to generate and transfer a full pattern table for every game frame.

CPU is unable to use of all of the available VRAM bandwidth and there's no DMA device to do it either, similar problem to SMS/GG which have much more bandwidth than CPU can use up on its own. MD and SNES add DMA that can use up all the bandwidth available.

I would try to find a balance between resolution and complexity of textures to increase speed. I'm not a fan of complicated textures at low resolution anyway (that's why I think a lot of games on PS1 looked so bad). If you did some sort of polygon method, you could make basic shapes with solid colors, like the road with gray, grass with green, water with blue... Essentially if you can find where to draw the corners of the shapes on the screen, just connect those points with line drawing code and XOR fill.<br /><br />The nice thing also about filling polygons with XOR filling is that it simplifies the line drawing code. You don't need to draw a line like this:<br /><br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">-------X<br />-------X<br />------X-<br />------X-<br />-----X--<br />-----X--<br />----X---<br />----X---<br /></div><br /><br />It only requires 1 pixel to be set per column of pixels:<br /><br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">-------X<br />--------<br />------X-<br />--------<br />-----X--<br />--------<br />----X---<br />--------<br /></div><br /><br />This speeds up line drawing tremendously. The more I think about this, the more I want to try this out and see how it looks!
