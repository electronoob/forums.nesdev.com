		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I was searching for the wiki and I ended up in that thread. I will give my opinion on the current subject.   
<br />
<br />I think there's at the least, a minimum that the user of the tutorial should know:
<br />
<br />- basic CS skill (what is a variable, a loop etc)
<br />- basic 6502 asm programming 
<br />
<br />Your goal is to write a tutorial about how to program on the nes, not about learning how to program in general.  
<br />
<br />This should be clear for the potential readers from the beginning.  For the readers that may not have the knowledge, referring then to an external reference about the subject that they may lack knowledge of would be a plus.
<br />
<br />Once you know about basic CS and 6502 you are automatically aware that developing your software will requires some tools. A basic introduction of the available tools without going into details would be a must.  Advanced users could use that information from the get go and beginners would be now aware of them.  At a later stage, how to use those tools would be explained in the appropriate module (or the module do a reference to the appropriate how-to).
<br />
<br />Now that we know which tools I have access to we need to know what steps are required to create my first application.  There is good chances the nes needs some basic initialization to work.  This is the first thing to explain.
<br />
<br />From that point, you go incremental in concept.  As long one concept can be built on top of the other, the better. The tutorial example grow with every step.
<br />
<br />Which step would be perfect, that I cannot tell since I'm looking exactly for that exact information. I want to learn how to program on the new but I don't know where to start from.  
<br />
<br />Finally, what is the most important in the writing process of your tutorial is to do a review with your target audience.  The problem with writing a tutorial is that you already know the subject: it's hard to confirm if what you wrote is clear enough.  Your target audience will bring all kind of questions that you may have not though about and it will improve the tutorial content.

<br />I would imagine that a lot of the audience knows programming but not assembly language for the 6502 family. So on what 6502-based platform should the user be familiar with 6502 programming? Should we refer people to an Apple II tutorial, a Commodore 64 tutorial, or something else?

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />If the tutorial is about programming the NES by definition, referring to other 6502 systems might be distracting.  The asm syntax, addressing modes, and i/o ports are really three different things to grasp.  Beginners should be aware up front that they'll have to study all three to make software (plus the quirks of PPU frame timing and bank switching when you want to make a side-scroller).
<br />
<br />It's probably best to learn 6502 instructions and addressing without a system-specific context, and juxtaposing it with a HLL might help experienced programmers learn asm:
<br />
<br />char array = {5,6,7,8};
<br />char sum = array[2] + 0x14;
<br />printf("%d\n",sum)          // would print 27
<br />
<br />in 6502:
<br />
<br />array:
<br />.db 5,6,7,8
<br />ldx #$02          ; load X register with 2
<br />lda array, X       ; absolute indexed addressing
<br />                       ; loads accumulator with the
<br />                       ; contents of the address of array+X
<br />clc                    ; clear carry flag before adding
<br />adc #$14          ; adds 20 to contents of accumulator
<br />jsr PrintAccumulatorContents ; must be implemented elsewhere

<br />
<br />This is a good question.  Like mentioned by Strat, if we refer them to a tutorial it should be platform independent.  Basic 6502 skill should be about pure 6502 asm only.
<br />
<br />For example, you can learn the C language without having to know about Win32, unix, ms-dos etc.  Once you know C, you can learn about the specific platform that you are interested.  That is usually what they do in CS classes.
<br />
<br />Since I'm in this situation, I would love to find a nice generic 6502 tutorial.  Then, what I would do is practice with a 6502 simulator.  I know there is one web based (<a href="http://www.6502asm.com/" class="postlink">http://www.6502asm.com/</a>) and another one for windows made by Michal Kowalski (<a href="http://home.pacbell.net/michal_k/6502.html" class="postlink">http://home.pacbell.net/michal_k/6502.html</a>).
<br />
<br />What would be interesting as an appendix to these tutorials is a section about common problem solving on the nes.  That is always a time saver.

<br />C programs written in CS classes rely on &lt;stdio.h&gt;, an I/O library whose implementations across multiple platforms share a standard API. Assembly language doesn't have this luxury unless a program written in assembly language uses the local implementation of C standard I/O.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />C was just used as an example since it exist on so many platform. You still learn how to use C in CS classes without learning how the platform works.
<br />
<br />In the case of the 6502, you're on your own unless a specific platform gave you some kind of library in their SDK.
<br />
<br />Since I'm looking (not seriously yet) to find one, this is what I think I would be looking for as a tutorial:
<br />
<br />It explains me about&#058;
<br />
<br />- The available registers (accumulators, indexes, segments if any)
<br />- The addressing mode 
<br />- The list of all possibles commands
<br />
<br />If some basic information about variables, loop etc is explained too, even better. Then I could test it in a simulator.
<br />
<br />Any of those tutorial exist or I'm just too optimistic?

<br />
<br />They introduce the architecture of the processor, explain the addressing modes, provide a really good reference for each instruction, and even have a "algorithms" section, where some basic principles are explained.
<br />
<br />Read that while trying out stuff on the <a href="http://home.pacbell.net/michal_k/6502.html" class="postlink">6502 Simulator</a> and you'll be good to go.

<br />About the simulator, it is a nice one, I tried a few time.  Since he offer the code, it would be great if we could make a nes simulator, but that would requires too much job.  That could be a great tool for developing nes games thought.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Yes, the idea of a NES simulator was discussed before. It would be a nice tool indeed. It would probably be easier to turn a NES emulator into such a tool though... The authors of the good (accurate) emulators could consider including an assembler somehow... There is a simple assembler in FCEUXD, but that's not exactly what we need. Something simple, like asm6, that can quickly assemble from a single input without much setup, so that the same type-and-go system featured in the 6502 simulator is retained. If options to save the ROM and the source file(s) was included, it'd make a nice all-in-one development tool.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Yes, I guess it would be a good idea to add extra ones, more like the first set of example that Blarg did.   Hiding too much about what the nes can do (second set) had the opposite effect on me: I was not able to understand what was going on.
<br />
<br />I started out of those and I was able to learn how to load some chr-data, show it on the screen, scroll it, show a sprite, change the palette, use the joystick etc.  I learned how to use the minimum for ca65 and create some makefile to simplify the process. I still have a lot to learn but I'm very grateful that I found those examples, it helped me a lot. By the way, thanks Blarg for your example, I never said it to you directly. It got me started and I'm happy about that.
<br />
<br />Now I put my nes project on hold because I need some tools to create the data. I'm planning to build a small map editor for my needs.  I want to make it as simple as possible, just to be able to show more things on the screen.  I just don't want to code my map by hand, I'm a visual guy and I want to see the result on the screen right away.  And it's easier to manage later.  If I do make it (I'm doing enough programming at work so I don't know if I can invest a lot of time on it in my spare time), I may give it back to the community, if anybody is interested.
