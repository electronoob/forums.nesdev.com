Normally, the NES PPU skips one dot before every second video field in order to make the dot crawl pattern appear stable. But it doesn't skip the dot if rendering is turned off. So to get that shimmering on an NES, you could leave rendering turned off for the first scanline for two consecutive frames out of every eight, ten. This may be tricky to time and may cause (invisible) flicker artifacts in the top overscan, I'll admit.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=9">tepples</a> — Thu Nov 09, 2017 8:54 am</p><hr />

You can see a lot of diagonal groups where it's discoloured, but it complements the texture nicely there, esp. because the angle of the artifacts is the same as that diagonal direction anyway.<br /><br />The regular dither patterns above the flat stones, though, you can see how the varying emphasis the the regular shapes there produces strange grouping patterns. This will shimmer and stand out very strongly as soon as you start to scroll as well. (Especially note how about just below the middle of the image, there's lines of 4 pixels that are emphasized. That will change with scrolling, dimming and brightening every 3 pixels.)<br /><br />If you want to try it out without using an emulator, you could make 3 images with the tool, each with 1 more column of pixels on it to adust the phase of the artifacts. (Note: the phase changes only when you scroll-- when standing in one place it will not shimmer, so it's going to be driven by player movement, rather than being a continual animating thing like this GIF.)<br />tower3_shimmer.gif<br /><br />It's a subtle problem, though, not necessarily something you have to worry about.

The parallaxing hanging chain is a nice touch (but doesn't really have to do with the curve).

At the same time, though, I probably wouldn't want to spend as many extra tiles as it would take to imply that more strongly anyway-- as a square tower it already looks great.

Aha, so the background would only be lines of colour, and the sprites would provide the detail. <br />I might change this, but right now, the wall is completely opaque (the bg colour is the bright sky one, and the black is shared by three subpalettes), so that's a start. <br /><br />I'll keep this idea in the options drawer for posterity*, thanks!<br /><br /><br />*(it'll take some time before we can actually work on this properly because we already have one game to finish).<br /><br />Another (simpler, less impressive) option is to simply center the camera so nothing outside is shown when scrolling vertically. <br /><br />If blarggs' tool is accurately showing these artifacts, i don't think the still image looks that bad?

I've been thinking about treating myself with one (to be able to play N.American releases properly, but also to be able to test things like these out).<br /><br />But yeah, these two mockups are so-far pretty heavy on dither in places I think it just might be the style i want, but i may want to revise it if i find it godawful on HW. <br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"><br />My initial assumption was that a tower level would have vertical scrolling (and thus vertical parallax). So I was surprised when you showed with that GIF that you meant to shift the parallax background only horizontally. Is this screen meant to be static vertically then?<br /></div><br />Yes <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /> <br /><br />I figured there's some merit to it being the other way around (not as a general rule for the game, but as a mode among others you can have in some level segment to vary the overall experience).<br /><br />Vertical progression + vertical scrolling, and<br />vertical progression + vertically static screens<br /><br />will provide very different opportunities to present platforming challenges, enemy behavior and so on. Think about Battle Kid 1/2 and how much the gameplay relies on a scene/screen being set up all at once for its platforming puzzles to work. It's also different from the church tower in <em>Warakiya village</em> in CV3, where the pit of death is constantly changing depending on your elevation because of the ratchet scroll, but in my mockup, pits of death are fixed-point.<br /><br />Another reason i wanted this segment to scroll horizontally is because i'm thinking of ways the player could interact with the outside (i don't want to spoil <em>how</em> at this point). <br /><br />&lt;Digression&gt;<br />Another study case i find interesting is <em>the clock tower of untimely death</em> in CV3: You go up, and after defeating Grant DaNasty's monster form, you go back down. The scrolling mode is ratchet scrolling which herds the player character in the right direction. The part i find so interesting is that they change the direction of the ratchet, so first when you scale the tower, if you fall down, you fall to your death. But on the way down, you can take plenty of shortcuts by simply falling. Besides the obvious point that it lets you get back to the door, i think they made it this way so that the downhill travel would intentionally take a lot shorter time and feel different (which makes a lot of sense since the level is reused). The fact that Grant is faster, jumps longer, can control his trajectory while jumping/falling, and climb walls also plays part in the shortcut taking/quick backtracking, all while keeping it fresh.&lt;/Digression&gt;<br /><br />Of course, you can do some timing-based platforming puzzles in a vertically scrolling tower, too. Above mentioned clock tower in the digression, for example, has a few instances where the spawning of a medusa head is triggered based on player elevation (you set it off by a jump that forces the scroll upwards). The puzzle here is to sync the enemies' appearance nicely with the cycle of constantly spawning medusa heads to make life a bit easier while maneuvering through the building. <br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"><br />Your estimates for tile permuations sounded like you only meant for 1 dimension of parallax, not 2.

If you make a checkerboard dither, there will be a repeating diagonal wave of emphasis 6 pixels wide across that dither.

So I was surprised when you showed with that GIF that you meant to shift the parallax background only horizontally. Is this screen meant to be static vertically then? Your estimates for tile permuations sounded like you only meant for 1 dimension of parallax, not 2. (Incidentally, using sprites could make both feasible at once?)<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=5165">rainwarrior</a> — Tue Nov 07, 2017 11:24 am</p><hr />

I wonder how it can be obvious it scrolls at the backgrounds' pace? The tile animation should be able to completely prohibit the gradient from appearing as scrolling (even if it techically is). <br /><br />An analogy might be in place: If you drive a car on a big treadmill, and the treads of the mill scroll backwards, and you drive forwards at the exact same speed, you remain in the same place in the eyes of anyone observing. That's what the tile animation should be able to do, towards the result as shown in the mock-up. <br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"><br />I don't think it should eat that many tiles, why do you mention a 512kB cart<br /></div><br />If the tree lines are using 80 tiles alone* in this tower section of a level, that's a trickle. In my previous mockup (the one with the castle and the low, flat stage), that scene alone is using up all 4kB:s, so it's a somewhat bigger trickle. Together (if they were strung together), they do not really make up a complete level of average actionvania length. So imagine many trickles adding up to a stream that makes up a level, and then add together a bunch of levels and you have a river wide of graphics and level data. Getting detailed and custom like this for a complete game would require those 512kB:s, and using 512kB prg-rom was mostly not in the budget of most historical NES games (128-256kB seems about average?).<br /><br />*actually, it can maybe be made with some fewer than 80 tiles and still look roughly the same, because i just might be able to reuse some same tiles in different attribute cells. That's for another day to experiment with. <br /><br />Thanks, i really appreciate that you've taken the time to discuss this.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">Diskover wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"><br />You do not have a CHR?

Everything is done in NESST, except the rendered camera movement and sprite layering of the chain, which is done in PS, in this case. Sometimes when i want to get fancy, i use AfterEffects instead, especially for sprite animation reviews. <br /><br />I could never draw that thing as seen from scratch using PS - it's too far away from how the NES graphics are laid out, + NESST helps me keep track of my tile budget.<br /><br />Sorry, i sometimes feel hesitant sharing the chr:s of works in progress because i don't want too many &quot;incomplete&quot; versions floating around. It's just me being a bit sensitive while in the process.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=7508">FrankenGraphics</a> — Tue Nov 07, 2017 7:35 am</p><hr />

Well, having the side trees rendered multiple times and changing the tiles on the fly when scrolling makes sense, this avoids eating sprites. However I do not think having that dithering on the sky gradiant scroll makes sense, especially after applying NTSC filter. I don't think it should eat that many tiles, why do you mention a 512kB cart ?<br /><br />I do not see how a sprite-based HUD is conflicting with it being a sprite, as long as it's never on the same scanlines.<br /><br />Leaving the sky-gradiant dithering as it, but scrolling with the main background might work but it might be obvious it scrolls at the frontground's pace and look weird. So I really think the optimal would be to stick with horizontal lines. Wasting tiles to represent a scrolling dither pattern really doesn't make much sense.<br /><br />Your work is amazing, I could never draw such beautiful graphics.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=38">Bregalad</a> — Tue Nov 07, 2017 6:42 am</p><hr />
