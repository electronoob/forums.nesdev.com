<br />
<br />I'm making decent progress on a mini-shooter I'm working on, though I'm not planning on it being anything mindblowing or anything. I'd say...mmm... I'm about 20-25% through of what I would LIKE it to be. It's still very early. Anyone else have a decent estimate on how far into development your projects you are? If you have more than one, feel free to post how you are doing on each.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I have a few projects, most of which are like 0% done, unfortunately. I'm currently working on my platformer, ChateauLevania, which is an intentional ripoff of Castlevania, it just takes place at a place called "Chateau Leveaux", which is somewhere I used to live. I'm writing a cheesy horror story about that place, and the game goes along with that story. I'm also working on an RPG with Bregalad. We are still planning a lot of stuff. I've made about 75% of the world map engine, so that's good. I was making a couple of other games which were simple platformers, and there was one that was a pacman style game that I haven't done anything for in a long time. But if I wanted to, I could probably start from scratch and make that game in like 4 days.
<br />
<br />I've been planning a lot for ChateauLevania, which I plan to make completely amazingly awesome. There's going to be huge background bosses, tons of parallax scrolling, 3D cutscenes, (which we're talking about in the "Polygon Filling" thread) and over all just really good graphics. I HOPE it turns out that way. Yeah, it's going to be a huge ROM (Probably 512k MMC3). But I've been kind of pre-occupied, so I'm not coding too much, unfortunately.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Up until my latest polygon filling craze I was working on a shoot'em up, just like you, except for the C64 (other 6502 platforms counts too, right? ;). It has all kinds of exciting new technology (a new hacked graphics mode, level streaming from the floppy, lots and lots of simultaneous sprites and so forth) but there just isn't much of a game in there yet. It is playable though, with a  few enemy types, some animation and this neat laser power-up thing..
<br />
<br />The thing is I still haven't been able to find a new graphics artist willing to work on the damned thing, which is quite discouraging really. I always kind of assumed that if you had a solid demo then skilled people would automatically come out of the woodwork and come to your aid.
<br />
<br />Here's <a href="http://minoan.ath.cx/~doynax/6502/botst.zip" class="postlink">the demo</a> and an old(ish) screenshot:

<br />
<br />Myself, my only project right now is to learn as much about NES game making as possible. I've been making little games all my life using various tools, and I think making a NES game would be sooooo cool. Making a PC bestseller wouldn't even come close. Unfortunately, learning how to program NES seems to be a tricky business, and I haven't found an easy way to learn how to do it yet, but am eagerly awaiting whatever blargg and tepples are cooking in the other thread.

<br />Tell you what, I'd be happy to send you the tools and describe the restrictions involved so you can try your hand at it.
<br />However may want to wait until that damned host comes online first to see if it's a project worth working on in the first place..

<br />I'm working on a game called Dragon Skill right now, it's an action game with RPG elements introducted. The game engine is 100% finished, and I have a couple of levels and enemies done, I still have quite some work to do until the whole thing is completed. Let's say the whole project is about 75% far by being optimistic.
<br />
<br />I had another RPG project that is like 0.5% done, and I have a couple of ideas for other games as well.

<br />I have a freewebs account. I have a ton of files uploaded on it, they haven't done anything about it even if it is against their policy. However, they do have an annoying "This site was created with freewebs" thing on the bottom of the page at all times.
<br />
<br />If you choose to make a freewebs account, don't make an easy-web builder account, make a raw-coding account. Everything just seems easier with it, ironically.
<br />
<br />Oh, Bregalad, I'm so envious of your finished game engine. I SO wish my ChateauLevania game engine was finished. I would be so happy. But I have a lot of work to do: making a non-constant palette system, making a scrolling engine that can scroll in two directions at once, making AI, making game mechanics (HP system, experience system, etc.), making a good map format (I've got a pretty good idea of what I'm doing, but I'm not all the way sure), making the sound engine, handling split-screen-scrolling, Heavy CHR RAM updates, and probably a bunch of other crap I can't think of.
<br />
<br />I basically know what I want the game to be like. That's about it. I've at least made a sprite drawing routine and a 4-way scroller that doesn't scroll in 2 directions at once. Trust me, the scrolling engine is the most annoying thing to try and make. I was so annoyed with it. Applying 2 directions at once won't be so bad. I'm still planning though, and I have a lot to think about. And it's also taking so long because I'm not just going to have garbage graphics with crappy sprites and really monotonous colors. I hope in the end my efforts pay off.

Also, a hard thing is to make the player move smooth and confortably in function of what the player wants. Design enemies is hard. Code scrolling, etc... is overrated in difficulty in my opinion.
<br />
<br />Also, if anyone wants to know which is the best homebrew on the NES, it's NESnake 2 without a single doubt. This game could easily be commercialized as it back then, and it absolutely rocks. When you think Heroes of the Lance was commercialized, it really look crap.
