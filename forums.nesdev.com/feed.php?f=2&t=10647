Cost is definitely a huge thing, if not the biggest thing when it comes to the actual product and production. I am a jack-of-all-trades who needs a lot of graphics for this project, so something like the MMC3 is ideal, and I don't have to pay an artist because I'll be doing it myself. But discrete parts are super cheap (like 20 cents per chip) and if all you need is 8 kb of CHR ROM or something then using MMC3 &quot;just because&quot; is just throwing your money away. Not only that, but when I was working with the UNROM format, I learned a lot while trying to tackle the various issues I was having with its limits, which of course is invaluable.<br /><br />The main reason I am developing a new game for the NES is BECAUSE of the limitations. I find they force me to think in ways that I otherwise would never have given the virtually unlimited freedom of, say, PC development or Flash/Air. The constraints are what drive me to push the limits of the console as well as my own limits of creativity and problem solving.<br /><br />Either way, at the end of the day, Super Mario Bros is NROM. Enough said.  <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_cool.gif" alt="8-)" title="Cool" /><p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=6204">mrmmaclean</a> — Tue Nov 12, 2013 11:15 am</p><hr />

The attitude that you don't need MMC3 if you don't have gobs of CHR data, or that you don't need anything more than UxROM unless you absolutely have to have WRAM, and that you don't need WRAM and can do everything in system RAM unless you want to provide battery-backed saves, and that you don't need saves because you can use a password system, is unproductive.

Well, it is catch 22/chicken'n'egg problem with things like that. Linux for example wasn't considered platform for gaming because no one made games for it and no one made games for it because no one was gaming on Linux. Until recently.<br /><br />It'll take some time until major players except Valve goes to Linux as target, but I'm digressing.<br /><br />I guess what I'm trying to say is that lack of ability to do something often inhibits any tries to do so. And often it's the other way around than you might think. Like with Linux gaming.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=4924">darkhog</a> — Mon Nov 11, 2013 7:38 pm</p><hr />

As a matter of fact, I must thank you for mentioning the MMC3 and both yours and tepples' links! I ordered his flasher and a couple of upgraded boards already!<br /><br />I have converted my code over to MMC3, and while it was an interesting learning experience to write and test a generic scanline counter for splits, having a built in counter that doesn't waste my cycles is already a boon. And with battery backed RAM in addition to double the ROM size, everything I require for sweet NESsing is on the INL board!

Alright, I was running it on FCEUX 2.2.1 and getting the weird glitch. I decided to check for a new version and there's now v2.2.2 and it works correctly!!<br /><br />Sorry for all the trouble. I'm sure anyone who tried the ROM and is not a fool probably didn't know what I was talking about. Note to self: check for the newest version of emulators to test...  <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_redface.gif" alt=":oops:" title="Embarassed" /><p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=6204">mrmmaclean</a> — Tue Nov 05, 2013 4:02 pm</p><hr />
