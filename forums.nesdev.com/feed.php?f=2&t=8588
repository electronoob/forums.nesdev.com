A local arcade has a PlayChoice-10 cabinet with Rad Racer, and it exhibits a lot of scanline glitches on the right side of the screen (way more than Nestopia or an ordinary console show). It's not a problem with the hardware, because the owner has another PCB that does the same thing. Both boards also show a single column of flickering pixels on the far right edge of the screen that seems to be related to OAM somehow.<br /><br />I'm really curious as to what timing differences and other quirks the RGB PPU might have compared to the original NTSC model.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=935">BMF54123</a> — Wed Mar 02, 2016 2:46 pm</p><hr />

On a side note, my original reaction was that it was some sort of NMI timing issue.  Nintendulator actually does not pass all the NMI timing tests.  I've been trying to debug it to figure out why, but I have yet to find a solution.  I would still like to fix it and I welcome suggestions to that end.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=6828">zeroone</a> — Mon Feb 29, 2016 4:36 pm</p><hr />

The 3D mode is created by alternating blue and red frames.  For some reason, I thought they were merged-color frames, which is probably impossible on the NES.  Anyway, Window mode is not vync'd and this was creating what appeared to be bands of color.  In full screen mode, that effect is gone.  I saw a similar effect in all the other emulators out there.  I guess it's just very difficult to get vsync to work in Window mode generally.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=6828">zeroone</a> — Mon Feb 29, 2016 4:31 pm</p><hr />

Don't worry you analized the things in much more detail than I. And I completely forgot about the lower 8 lines that gets their own scroll value. In level 1 I don't think this has any effect, but in the city levels (2 and 5) this is very visible, as well as in the Grand Canyon level (I think it's 3).<br />It gives an additional parallax effects to the background, and of course the sprite zero hit is right before this first split point (not right before the start of the road).<br /><br />It's interesting to see the game was designed to be robust on timing errors. Effectively everything is timed from the sprite zero hit and they had to prevent the status bar from shaking and stuff like that. Considering the tools they had back then it's impressive.<br /><br />I think the reason Rad Racer uses self-modifying code is because the game was originally written for the FDS. I know there was never any FDS release of the game, but it's pretty obvious it was intended for the FDS : The game engine is heavily based on 3D-Wolrdrunner which originally was a FDS game, and it still uses FDS registers like $100-$103 for it's interrupts.<br /><br />Also it uses raw uncompressed nametables, which sounds dumb at first, but on the FDS you could store nametables as files and load them directly into VRAM (without loading them in RAM) which the FDS version of 3D worldrunner does.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=38">Bregalad</a> — Sun Feb 05, 2012 10:35 pm</p><hr />
