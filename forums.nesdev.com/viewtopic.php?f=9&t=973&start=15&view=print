Did I place something incorrectly? Were you supposed to stick those 4 things into where the CPU used to be? And I didn't get 2 seperate things that connected the copyNES board and the NES board, I got 1 connected thing. I hope I was right in assuming that 1 connected thing took place of those two connected things. But yes, I put my CPU in the slot, and it luckily fit. But! I did burn a little plastic on the slot that you stuck the CPU in, I don't think it did damage though. Are the capacitors on the CopyNES board supposed to be facing a certain way? And! One final question. The Connector that connects the cable to the copyNES board. The plastic is supposed to be on the bottom of the board, correct? And you are supposed to connect the cable to the side with the plastic, yes? I'm sorry, there's like 10000 questions that are like (DUH.), but I just want to see why my copyNES won't work.

<br />Cool, yeah I should be able to make enough for everyone.  When I get some prototypes of that, you can get one of those if you want (the real fun will start a few weeks after I verify the proto).
<br />
<br />I have Squeedo pcbs also that are available to anyone, both revisions just sitting around needing something to do, but I haven't bought the PICs yet to fully build more (or serial adapters, actually I'm really thinking I may make a USB adapter though the parts are more expensive).

<br />
<br />I feel I should let you know that resistors do not have polarity - it doesn't matter which way they are facing. Diodes and (most) capacitors, however, do.

<br />
<br />[ ] Install RN2 - 4.7K ohm resistor network (marked 472G.  Make sure
<br />    dot on the resistor network lines up with the small "1" marking on PCB!

<br />
<br />They use Flashrom, so they'll keep their programming.  I also put a pull-up resistor to the CopyNES' extra control line, so the cart would also run in an unmodified NES (if the cart's lockout chip is installed, of course).  A single assembled one I imagine would be $15 or so.

<br />If you can demonstrate to eBay that you are the copyright owner of your work, then eBay permits you to list copies of your work.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Okay, I've brought up this dead forum like 10000 times, but this is the last. I have put my copyNES together, and so far, the NES part of my copyNES works, but I don't know if the COPYNES part of the copyNES works. He said something about how to test it that I didn't get. How am I supposed to test and see if the copyNES part of the copyNES is working with the PC? 
<br />
<br />I hope it works, I did notice a small tear in an I/O line by the cable connector, but I made the lines touch again, and I attempted to have a wire starting from 1 end to the other end of the I/O line, but it sort of broke off. Would that work? just a solder wire going from point A to point B substituting for a broken I/O line? I think the line should still be connected though. What are you even supposed to do for a broken I/O line?

<br />
<br />First of all: what? Second of all, what does that mean? That's the error message you get when the thing isn't on/connected/related to the computer in any way. My copyNES is on, the cord is connected, a game will play in the copynes, but it isn't associated with the computer in any way. Okay, let me just ask a few questions. Are you supposed to turn the power on at a certain time? Are you supposed to insert a cartridge at a certain time? Is the copyNES supposed to allow you to play a cart like a regular NES all the time? Sorry, I'm just trying to fix my copyNES, and I'm confused why it doesn't work. It makes me upset! Thanks to anyone who responds. =)

You need to extract it to the SAME PLACE as the MS-DOS client - specifically, in the same directory as the file "MAPPERS.DAT".<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">Celius wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">And you were saying to restore the directory structure?</div>

<br />That's for extracting the QBASIC client, which you already did a long time ago.
