<br />Wow thanks for digging this up!  I haven't seen this project before, LOTs of good files on that nesworld link.
<br />
<br />With all those files included it shouldn't be difficult to port the project over to a current Xilinx CPLD.  Although I'm not sure about the programming interface for the rom image, I didn't look at that much but all the source and schematics seem to be there.
<br />
<br />You need a JTAG programmer to flash the Xilinx CPLD.  I didn't see the files you would need to program the CPLD either (usually .svf) files. But you could easily make them by downloading xilinx webpack for free and recompiling the source, he's even got the project files there as well.
<br />
<br />Not sure what your experience level is but IMO you would have to have a fairly significant amount of knowledge about this stuff to consider it DIY.  I realize that was his end goal, but with the project in it's current state I wouldn't consider it DIY anymore.  It's definitely a good start though,  I fully intend to make use of some of these files for the <a href="http://nesdev.com/bbs/viewtopic.php?t=8084&amp;highlight=" class="postlink">NESDEV1</a> dev cart I'm currently working on.
<br />
<br />He really does provide most of the files you would need to pick up the project.  I would be interested to see any progress you make if you decide to pick it up from where it left off.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Thanks for your help. That's the problem, the fact that my knowledge in programing is quite basic. I'm actually good at electronics especially when it comes to designing and manufacturing but again my knowledge regarding digital stuff is kinda poor (i should have paid more attention to that microcontrollers and CPU Architecture clases <img src="./images/smilies/icon_neutral.gif" alt=":|" title="Neutral" /> ). In this case my only problems are programing the Xilinx and the writing of the software for the cart. I think i'll abandon the idea of reproducing the cart and i'll develop one of my own (with less performances of course) using the data from the schematic. But first i need to understand how the mappers work. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_confused.gif" alt=":-?" title="Confused" /> 
<br />
<br />Yes I know about your project. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /> Damn awesome. It actually came to my attention before finding about the FunkyFlashCart. But it seems to complicated for me and i lack in some certain equipment (the retrozone donor cart and that usb development board. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />) If you can point me in some direction were i can learn more about NES development and "how do stuff work" i would be very very thankful. Cheers!

<br />What USB development board are you speaking of?  If you're refering to my video that was only an atmega8 some descrete components and solderless breadboard.  Less than $10 all together.  I started with this serial eeprom programmer <a href="http://xldrx.com/xl/EE-Prog.html" class="postlink">http://xldrx.com/xl/EE-Prog.html</a> and just ripped out all the I2C code and replaced it with a parallel memory interface.  All AVR development in done in C.
<br />
<br />The retrousb.com board I play around with is only $4.
<br />
<br />But yes, there is some financial investment involved but it's really low if you want it to be.  You could learn and demo out a LOT for less than $50 assuming you already have some NES carts to investigate.
<br />
<br />The wiki is a good reference, but I found it pretty useless when I started the project (less than a year ago).  I had a good grasp of digital logic and programming in C and basic computer architecture, but no technical knowledge of the NES.  The problem was I was trying to learn the hardware of carts and the NES and most documents are written from a programming/software perspective.  Even the simple schematic on the UNROM wiki boggled my mind for weeks.  I mostly used Kevtris' nes cart types doc and ROM pinouts to reverse engineer some discrete mappers using a multimeter and drew out the schematics.  Then I looked up the datasheets and really figured out how the mappers work on a hardware level.
<br />
<br />Once you get to that point and understand what bank switching really is things start to make more sense.  At that point you could start playing around and running some demos and such.  Then you could invest the $4 in a repropak and reverse engineer that thing to understand how you can get most discrete mappers on one cart easily.  Eventually you'll understand enough to dive into MMC1/3 which I'm working on now.  Those schematics you linked to are especially helpful and knowing that they were tested and worked is a big bonus.
<br />
<br />One thing to get a grasp on early on is the NES memory map and there are good pics in the nes documentation.  All items I spoke of are below and were really my bible for the first couple months.
