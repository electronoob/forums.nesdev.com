		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Hello everyone,<br /><br />As far as MML goes, I have seen nesmus, and I've seen mck and its relatives. For FamiTone, the admonition is to use FamiTracker. <br /><br />I've been working on a command-line tool to translate MML to assembly which is compatible with FamiTone. It's written in Lua, and I currently have it under a BSD 2-clause license <a href="https://github.com/Heathcode/famml" class="postlink">here.</a> It is a WIP and not ready to use in production, but I'd be happy to have some help with it. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />Demo:<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">$ lua52 famml.lua<br />Famml! - Convert MML to assembly compatible with NES and FamiTone<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;-h&nbsp; See this help screen<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;-o&nbsp; Redirect output to a file, as opposed to standard output<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;-p&nbsp; Accept input from a pipe<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;-a&nbsp; Load assembler settings from a file (default is ca65)<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;-s&nbsp; Output sfx<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;-m&nbsp; Output music (default)<br />$ cat foobar<br />@v0 = {12 1 2 2 3 3}<br />$ lua52 famml.lua foobar<br />@v0:&nbsp; &nbsp; .byte $CC<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; .byte $C1<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; .byte $C2<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; .byte $C2<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; .byte $C3<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; .byte $C3<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; .byte $7F<br />$ cat foobar | lua52 famml.lua -p<br />@v0:&nbsp; &nbsp; .byte $CC<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; .byte $C1<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; .byte $C2<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; .byte $C2<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; .byte $C3<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; .byte $C3<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; .byte $7F<br />$ cat foobar | lua52 famml.lua -p -o output.s<br />$ cat output.s<br />@v0:&nbsp; &nbsp; .byte $CC<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; .byte $C1<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; .byte $C2<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; .byte $C2<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; .byte $C3<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; .byte $C3<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; .byte $7F<br /></div><br /><br />It supports ca65, but all assembly output is in a Lua table, so this is easily expandable to other assemblers. The -a option allows for that, and more assembler output can be added into the code over time.<br /><br />Currently, I'm only beginning to do the actual assembly output. (I've been fighting with an interactive mode for a couple days, which I decided to throw away.)<br /><br />Notes:<br />* I don't like the name all that much. &quot;Famml&quot;. Any suggestions?<br />* Of course, in the demonstration, I'm typing in lua52. On Unix, a quick <tt style="margin-left: 2px; margin-right: 2px; padding:3px; background-color: #3355aa; color: white;">cp famml.lua famml; chmod +x famml</tt> should do the trick just fine.<br />* AFAIK, it is compatible with Lua 5.0+, and I'm most certainly using it with Lua 5.2. It shouldn't be that difficult to change it so it'll work with previous versions of Lua, if you really must use one of them.<br />* HALP?<br /><br />Thank you everybody. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />

(ppMCK supports multiple expansions at once, because NSF does, but if you are making a game you must use the expansion audio of the mapper, so only up to one is possible.)<br /><br />My program is at: <a href="http://zzo38computer.org/nes_program/ppmck.zip" class="postlink">http://zzo38computer.org/nes_program/ppmck.zip</a> (it is an enhanced version of ppMCK).

I hate the name &quot;Famml&quot;, but I'll keep it until the program gets better. What I'd really like is to keep learning more, and more, and target more systems than merely FamiTone. Just as Famml is expandable to other assemblers besides ca65, it should also be expandable in a similar way for other audio drivers. That way, Famml could become a little more of a general purpose MML-to-assembly translator, and then the name can go away, if it hasn't grown on me yet. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />
