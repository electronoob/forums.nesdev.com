(i.e. ignore the contents of A0)<br />Upper 16 and lower 16 bits of address bus go through two transparent latches inside the ROM, effectively latching the address on a falling edge of ALE_H or ALE_L.<br />A rising edge of /RD or /WR automatically adds 2 (i.e 16-bit aligned) to the current address. There are 8 bits of this behavior. (i.e. A1 through A8)<br /><br /><a href="http://assemblergames.com/l/threads/reflashing-or-making-reproduction-n64-carts.61695/#post-883560" class="postlink">This flashable board</a> uses a pile of 74-series parts with an ordinary 3V flash ROM. It's good enough for any of the save-less games.<br /><br />The N64 bootstrap expects to be able to read from the cart ROM starting at address 0x1000_0000. I think I remember reading that it reads a few bytes, setting properties of the Parallel Interface (the name for the cart/expansion port), then loads the first 4 KiB somewhere... and I think that in turn loads the first 1 MiB into RDRAM and the game &quot;really&quot; starts.

Even if the attached computer can capture game state, you'd need a way to verify that states match and adjust as necessary.

And it's not connected on PAL units; only on NTSC units.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"> I was wondering how hard would it be to hook those via the bottom to a rpi or similar, to get online play.<br /></div>Online play really requires the cooperation of the game, unfortunately. Especially in a console as complicated at the N64.<br /><br />In contrast, in the case of NES, the total game state is small enough, simple enough, and  that just brute-forcing it (and sending the entire 4K of RAM, plus coming up with some way to force the CPU-internal registers synchronized) is ... ridiculous, but plausible.<br /><br />But ... if you're writing all-new homebrew, sure, there's something here. The N64's Serial Interface is identical between the controllers and the on-cartridge EEPROM. It's a comparatively slow interface—only 250kbit/sec—but there's already a linux kernel module to interface to the controllers (&quot;gamecon_gpio_rpi&quot;). I don't know how hard it would be to make the RPi emulate a SIO endpoint instead of host, but I bet it's doable.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">would it have to bitbang on both sides, using way too much cpu?<br /></div>Only for things for which there's no native support. The N64 natively has both the Parallel and Serial Interfaces; although the former would be very awkward to emulate, it would connect easily and conveniently to, say, the ENC624J600 ethernet IC. And the latter is slow enough that bitbanging it is mostly within scope.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">I read that there are several protocols suitable for 3 wires or less, but even the good old serial uart bitbanging uses a lot of cpu.<br /></div>Depends on what you're doing, of course. If you use something shaped like asynchronous serial, you can save a lot of CPU time either by using an extremely slow timebase (e.g. sending 5N1.5 at 45.45 baud won't really tax anything) or an extremely fast timebase (Because then you're done with each byte in so little time that you can probably get back to whatever else you were doing).<br /><br />Similarly, bitbanging an I²C or SPI host is easy.

I'd like the unit to be compatible with all cartridges, not requiring its removal when playing any game.<br /></div>Well, other devices could be put on the Serial Interface via the expansion port. The protocol is a little janky, but does seem to support multiple endpoints per host. (See: the <a href="http://jackblackregion4.blogspot.com/2016/05/dobutsu-no-mori.html" class="postlink">NUS-07A</a> PCB, exclusively used for <s>Animal Crossing</s>Doubutsu no Mori, which connects both an EEPROM and an RTC to the Serial Interface)<br /><br />But then, if you're going to just use the Serial Interface, you really may as well just use the controller ports instead. Sure, it limits you to a three-player game (or else building a special Y cable), but that's probably ok.<br /><br />I think a much more practical option is to not aim for an expansion port thing. If your device is the only one attached (via the cartridge slot) you don't need to worry about what you'd conflict with.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">BTW, do you happen to know how much current is safe to pull via the 12v or 3.3v lines?<br /></div>The 12V supply seems to be barely used—just used by ENC-NUS (video standard encoding), AMP-NUS (audio), made available to the cartridge and RF modulator—so you probably have the vast majority of the 0.8A that the power supply specifies is available. I assume most of the spare ampacity was intended for the 64DD.<br /><br />On the other hand, I have no guess as to how much headroom is available for the 3.3V supply.
