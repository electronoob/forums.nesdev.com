It only remains as surnames or city names. Maybe some old company names, too. Some old cities were even upgraded to the modern Å, such as Århus.

I'm not sure but it could also prove problematic in finland even back in the day with its distinct use of double and single letters, where a can be spelled aa in words and å is called &quot;ruotsalainen oo&quot; and preserved in the alphabet for certain names only.<br /><br />On a technical level, if you have a full chr-rom and want to make å and ä fit, removing w and z would work for a localization given how rare they are outside names.

The paper slip that came with the game is supposedly a note that explains this problem with mixed up letters.<br /><br />Yeah a Scandinavians are probably very sensitive to the small differences between an å and an ä even in an 8x8 font so it would be a problem if they where mixed up.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">tepples wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"><div class="quotetitle">Pokun wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">I guess the Japanese people didn't think the diacritics was a required part of the letters or something.</div><br />&quot;Try reading kana without dakuten.&quot; The diacritics are even shaped nearly the same:<br /><span style="font-size: 150%; line-height: normal">ä – べ; å – ぺ</span></div>Yeah one Japanese friend that majored in Swedish combined dakuten characters togeter with A and O to represent Swedish letters on his phone. This was before the smartphone era and monospaced fonts was common, so you could combine dakuten with any character.<br /><br />Actually classic Japanese didn't use the diacritics as the sounds they represent didn't exist in Japanese when that writing was established. As the spoken language changed and got these new consonant sounds the written Japanese remained without a way to represent them for a long time. It was apparently Portuguese missionaries that invented the diacritics because they had trouble remembering when to change the consonant sound and not when learning the language. Thus old texts in classic Japanese don't use them, and so does certain machines that are printing in very low resolution fonts (like certain receipt printers).

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />A friend and I rented Shadowgate several times back when we were approx. 11 or 12 years old. This happened to be the Swedish version of the game; I never noticed there being an English language version of this game in Norway, if at all.   With the exception of a relatively few words (can't remember which, unfortunately), we didn't have any noteworthy problems understanding what was going on in the Swedish translation.<br /><br />In our childhood, we used to watch a lot of Swedish movies/television series like for example, 'Pippi Langstrømpe' and 'Emil i Lønneberget' unsubbed and undubbed on prime time telly, which I in hindsight find to have been a great influence.  Younger people nowadays also seem to communicate quite well with the Scandinavian neighbours.  I personally only know of a few fellow Norwegians who find the Danes to be difficult to understand orally.<br /><br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">Sumez wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">I laughed out loud in Shadowgate when I came across this huge snake, and the game described it as an &quot;orm&quot; (worm) <img src="./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" /></div>I see what you mean there. For some reason, 'snake' in Norwegian translates to both 'slange' and 'orm' ('slange' is the more proper word, btw), but 'worm' is usually 'meitemark', 'mark' or 'makk', depending on which part of the country one is from.

In fact I heard Norwegian is the best language to study if you want to be able to communicate with more Scandinavians.<br /><br />Slange is so funny because it sounds like slang (hose pipe). The Swedish word for worm is mask. Mark sounds like the Swedish word for ground so it kind of makes sense for something crawling on the ground.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">tepples wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">Dunno if I forgot to attach it or if the attachment didn't survive the split, but this is what I meant to attach with the double spacing.
