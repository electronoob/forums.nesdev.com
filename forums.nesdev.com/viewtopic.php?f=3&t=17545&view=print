It's recommending running FCEUX through WINE. I would prefer something native so I don't have to install WINE. It's very possible the answer to this question is that there is no Mac native NES emulator with a good debugger in 2018.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Your choices for good/quality debugging in NES emulators are three (3) emulators: FCEUX, Mesen, and Nintendulator.  All 3 are intended mainly for Windows, with Mesen being the exception.  <a href="https://www.mesen.ca/#Downloads" class="postlink">Mesen</a> (which is .NET-based, also using glibc and SDL 2.x) happens to work on Linux through Mono which means there may be some distant possibility it could work on OS X (but OS X != Linux).  I do not know how to do it.<br /><br />If you find other NES emulators that provide quality debugging on OS X, let everyone here know so they might use those options.  The <a href="http://wiki.nesdev.com/w/index.php/Emulators" class="postlink">Wiki</a> could also be updated to reflect that.

I think it is more something with my current setup than anything else. I will share my finding in the mesen thread once I figure out the cause.<br /><br />As for the thread mentioned by Koitsu, Nintendulator does work but sometime I had some UI glitch because of wine. Nintaco, just found it recently and it does seems to work well but I do not know about the debugger yet so I cannot comment on which one is better depending on your needs.<br /><br />I kind of code on one machine, debug on another one so I do not work in any specific environment these days ^^;;  The mac just happened to be my retired work machine which is faster than my main pc (core 2 duo/hdd) so I prefer the mac since it compile faster but always get my shortcut wrong <img src="./images/smilies/icon_lol.gif" alt=":lol:" title="Laughing" /><br /><br />I think for mac Wine is the way to go.  If you don't launch from the command line, just install wine bottler or something like that and it should simplify things.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Of course its debugging is not very extensive (see attached screenshot), but it's better than nothing and may be an okay stopgap for some until they get access to something with more extensive debugging capabilities. There are many emulators that are not often mentioned on NesDev but very popular on GitHub. That doesn't mean any of them are necessarily good <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /> And I don't know yet if any have good debuggers... I will keep looking.

I will check how to add the link for IOS one since it's a different repo.<br /><br />edit:<br /><br />I just separated the link since it will be easier that way.  As for the OS name, well, technically the older version is OS X and not it is called macOS so the author said OS X but I don't want to get into a &quot;name wars&quot; over small details <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />  The Wiki mentioned up to now OS X for the platform and people can figure out if it will work with their latest version or not. The wiki per se doesn't go into detail about the version though. <br /><br />I think the most important is that the emulator and the target platform is mentioned.  The rest, we can decide later what naming is better.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />My point was that a classic Mac user (read: from the 80s) would know how silly it would be to hem and haw over &quot;Mac OS&quot; (with a space) vs. &quot;OS X&quot; vs. &quot;macOS&quot;, and thus, arguing capitalisation and spacing semantics (esp. when most of those emulators were probably from 2016, which during late of was when Apple marketing decided to switch from &quot;OS X&quot; to &quot;macOS&quot;) was sad -- hence, sad Mac.  If a person says &quot;OS X&quot; we know what they mean, if they say &quot;MacOS&quot; when talking about present-day software/Macs, we know what they mean; the pedantry isn't necessary but is funny (to me) since Apple is effectively going back to the original name (sans a space and capitalisation -- again, who cares?) as their System 1 through 9 software.  ;-)<br /><br />Super off-topic as mentioned: as for the crash codes shown: it depends on the model of (&quot;classic&quot;) Mac, and *when* the crash/issue happens.  I remember that 0x0F meant an exception error, and that the remaining part of the code (or the code on the 2nd line) represented a detail/state code that was more indicative.  I had to do some digging, but <a href="https://udcf.gla.ac.uk/~gwm1h/Error_Codes/Sad_Mac_Codes.html" class="postlink">here you go</a>.  From that you should be able to discern that the Mac depicted is probably a Mac SE or Mac II indicating code 0x0000000F (exception error), subcode 0x0000000D (SCC failure; SCC = Zilog SIO (serial controller) used for controlling the serial ports).  SCC isn't a new term to me, since the smae chip is on the IIGS (an 8530) -- and I sure hope I'd be familiar with it, considering <a href="https://macgui.com/downloads/?file_id=10042" class="postlink">I wrote a IIGS CDA</a> back in the early 90s called QuickPort II that allowed setting the serial port &gt;19200bps, haha.  :D
