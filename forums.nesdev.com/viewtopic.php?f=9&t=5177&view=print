The only problems that I saw were the different palettes and the status bar jumping up and down when picking up ice blocks. Other than that, it works fine. Your wiring is probably incorrect somewhere.

<br />And then if you're feeling really evil, donate the cart to Nintendo, saying you discovered a pirate hack while working undercover.

<br />I'll chip in for that. I'm not too impressed with trying to earn money off of someone else's work. I appreciate the reproduction service, but claiming ownership is something else entirely.

<br />I agree, I was wondering how the author of Super Mario Adventure thought of someone hacking it to run on real hardware and then selling it without giving him a cut. Also, doesn't that borderline on piracy since it's based on SMB3?

<br />Well, technically all NES reproductions are intellectual property theft unless the game is fully homebrew. Bomb Sweeper is the closest to a legitimate game on that site, but even that is a close of a Game &amp; Watch game.
<br />
<br />I'd be willing to supply a donor cart if necessary to get it dumped. I'd prefer to chip in cash though, as I'd be shipping from Canada, so it would take longer.
