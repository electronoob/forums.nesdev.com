		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />The add-on chips (SuperFX, SA-1) would be pretty much impossible to interface to properly through a cart adapter, given the aforementioned port rate issues.
<br />
<br />Merging the video from a SuperFX in properly would also be a goddawful mess, as that's going to be running even faster.
<br />
<br />For anything else, the added instructions don't have much of an effect, as the bulk of the added cost is in decoding teh address to figure out what to do with it (have to find out when the code is writing to PPU registers for instance) and the added cost is so miniscule as to not be worth mentioning. Adding a couple of instructions to the access, when you're burning a million+ cycles on PPU+APU+CPU emulation is completely meaningless.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I said accessing of cartridge memory. Not the impact of emulating a coprocessor. Ofcourse it makes BSNES need more computing power to emulate something like SA-1. But there is no practical way to use a real SA-1 in conjunction to take that load off. 
<br />
<br />If you are concerned about BSNES's performance, buy a new computer. It doesn't that that expensive of a PC to run BSNES well. Also the increased requirements are not due to adding the "special chips". Yes games that use them will take more than games that don't, but games that don't would have incurred minimal related increases. Other increases would be all the non-special chip code that gets changed and added.

<br />I recently bought a Dell Mini 10. Does bsnes work well on low-end laptops? Or if I'm on a laptop, should I stick to developing game logic using the "inaccurate" emulators and then testing it on bsnes and a PowerPak once I come home to a full-size PC?

<br />LOL, I run bsnes just fine on my desktop. Although I acknowledge there are ppl out there that are not as fortunate as me. The point is that it would be neat to play with actual carts. This issue came up years ago on the ZSNES forums (I think it was about 6) and data transfer/reading rate was already blamed/determined to be the reason nobody had tried or done it. BTW just a little nitpick issue, but byuu doesn't want it written as BSNES. He like the b to be lowercase for some reason.

<br />As far I know Acer == Low Cost crap. BSNES works fine with NTSC filter on my 14'' Lenovo laptop, so I guess it'll work with anything with about equivalent processing power, that is 2.6 GHz dual core.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />When I went netbook shopping I opted for the Gateway Netbook with a 1.2 Ghz Athlon 64. It runs windows 7 just fine and it does Snes emulators just fine. Although I sometime can tell it's single core, it performs as if it were a 2ghz machine at least. I'm well pleased with it. I've seen a few Atom based netbooks that my customers have and I'm glad I went with the Athlon. I want to try it with a 64bit windows but I don't like the prospect of formatting it just to switch to a 64bit OS.
