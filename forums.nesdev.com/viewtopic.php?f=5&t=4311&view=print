<br />
<br />Yes, let us make retroactive rules that specifically ban specific people just to ban those specific people alone for life, then undo the rules. Even though they have not broken any rules already in place either intently, or in the first place.

<br />
<br />Yeah, I've actually noticed that these boards are usually very clean and professional compared to others, and it's sad to see vulgar language and content in recent posts here.
<br />
<br />Actually, Tepples, I think you should put up some rules regarding vulgarity. It would be nice to keep these boards clean and not have them become all trashy.

<br />Good idea. I don't plan to go as far as ACC and AXA do, with their "keep it E-rated" rule. Would a UserFriendly.org style "keep it T-rated" rule work?

<br />
<br />+1 on that.  I care less about the jargon issue than this. F^ck making up rules.
<br />
<br />jargon is clearly disrupting this board, you can't deny that.  Just give him the boot and move on.

<br />
<br />of course interpersonal stuff is hard, nobody relates to me because most have aspergers/autism or something and i am schizoid, two completely diametrically opposed personality types. people with trust issues on the aspie/autie level don't understand that most schizoids have completely seemingly alien, but are there, different trust levels.
<br />
<br />people usually assuming people with schizotypal personality disorders of some kind or another either trust anything or nothing. quite different actually, we trust based on what we believe to be trustworthy. just like how aspergers/autistics trust only who they trust to be trustworthy, usually based off cues that are just as backwards as the cues of schizoids.
<br />
<br />actually i never voted.
<br />
<br />i attempted to go back and swap out vulgarities with more acceptable words or just cartoon-like scrambles, but can't seem to find all the old posts easily, for my sleep cycles are messed up now, and i keep going back to bed after just two hours.
<br />
<br />making a bright-line word for vulgarities isn't quite fair when the persons that often use vulgarities are often not aware of the level of crass in their language, and could just as easily be reminded to once in a while go back and edit it out on their own. this is phpbb, the posts are "freakin" dynamic SQL data.
<br />
<br />i am 27, or something close to that, i realize i need people, doesn't mean i get along very well. often i find myself screaming inside at normal people just as often if not more often than most people on this board feel like screaming at me, difference is i do not let myself indulge in a "mass-scream" at someone like most boards including this one especially, seem to think is cool in this new millennium. i am starting to think this has become the millennium of spoiled tarts, not acceptance and group growth; it is as if personal tolerance has flown out the window.
