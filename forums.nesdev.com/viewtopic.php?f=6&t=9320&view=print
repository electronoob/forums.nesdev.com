(I am working on a similar thing for someone else, and can start once I have 6.nsf; the program will be public domain including source codes so you can use it if you want (but I will not release the pictures and music; the people who hired me will do that).)<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">from what ive read, vegaplay is not able to support any expansion audio, but can be modified to do so, i dont know how to program NES code, so im at a loss, and i believe its creator (NOCARRIER) has stopped all development on it.</div>I may be able to help to make it support expansion audio; however, you cannot use multiple expansions unless using a custom mapper.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">i did see a thread on here about CombiNSF, which sounds similar to what im looking for. just a way to combine all my songs into one nsf file, or playlist for live shows.</div>CombiNSF puts each song at a different track number, so you will still need to advance the track manually.

The output will additionally use FDS RAM, and will be bankswitched; the input files cannot be bankswitched.<br /><br />It may be possible to improve it to remove these restrictions. This can be discussed in the proper thread for doing so.
