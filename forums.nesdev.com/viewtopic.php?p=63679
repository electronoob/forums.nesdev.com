						<div class="postbody">Even if I've spent quite some time, in the past year, to improve compatibility in the NES emulation of MESS (by adding new mappers, by adding support for UNIF files and by implementing preliminary iNES 2.0 support), I have never been really happy with the current NES formats.
<br />Being my background mainly related to MAME, I've always been under the impression that gluing together the different chip contents + an 'arbitrary' header was not the best solution. Especially, given the large number of ROMs floating around with the wrong header (while working on pirate mappers, I have found tons of chinese roms generically assigned to Mapper 4 or 0, which in fact required different features to work), and the generic lack of consensus on some mapper numbers for obscure chinese carts.
<br />
<br />This is why, starting from today, MESS publicly supports loading zipfiles containing separate PRG and CHR files, <strong>in addition</strong> to iNES and UNIF! 
<br />The matching between the ROM files and the correspondent boards is obtained through a .xml database which gets read when carts are loaded and which is public for anyone to use (as long as new findings about obscure boards are made public so that anyone can use them): you can get a copy from this link (click on 'plain' and save the ~2.5MB xml file)
<br />
<br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://git.redump.net/cgit.cgi/mess/tree/hash/nes.xml">http://git.redump.net/cgit.cgi/mess/tree/hash/nes.xml</a><!-- m -->
<br />
<br />Before getting into the xml details, I would like to point out that only 3 things are required to add support for these files in any emu:
<br />1. an xml parser, to read info from nes.xml about the board type, the memory sizes, the mirroring, the dispwitches, the peripherals, etc.
<br />2. the capability to load separate files from inside a zipfile based on checksums or filenames (like MAME, Nebula and FBA do for arcade romsets)
<br />3. a lookup table to pass from the board type [read in nes.xml] to the correct mapper emulation. NEStopia has a lookup table of this sort in src/core/boards/NstBoard.h, if a reference is needed
<br />
<br />once the file is loaded in memory and the emulator has chosen the appropriate read/write handlers, emulation can go on as it would usually do after loading an iNES file to memory. 
<br />
<br />Now let's focus on the xml format. Let's examine a typical entry (in this case for Aerobic Studio)

Other possible 'dataarea' are "vram" (if present on the board), "wram" and "bwram" for PRG RAM with or without battery, "mapper_ram" and "mapper_bram" for mappers which have internal RAM with or without battery like MMC5, MMC6 &amp; Taito X1-005. At start, an emu should simply load prg &amp; chr, and take note of the other dataarea to setup VRAM &amp; WRAM like it would do by parsing the iNES header<br />- from &lt;dipswitch&gt;, you would read if the cart had switches on it (this is needed for a few pirate multicarts)<br /><br />Here are other three examples for Excitebike, Shin Satomi Hakkenden and Taito Grand Prix, respectively<br /><br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">&nbsp;

<br />
<br />Notice that, as shown by Excitebike, the "prg" dataarea is always at least 32KB wide, with smaller roms reloaded/mirrored where necessary
<br />
<br />A few more remarks:
<br />
<br />Concerning accuracy of the info in the xml list, the first part of the list is very precise, being based on the latest version of Bootgod's database.
<br />On the other hand, the second part is not so complete (yet): it contains files (around 2500)  from various other collections (GoodNES, nointro and NonGoodNES), with pcb, mirroring and vram/wram settings taken from the headers. As such, there might be mistakes which I hope to fix little by little... Moreover, additional info are mostly missing (I will add them next, but I thought checksums had definitely priority over Manufacturers and Release Dates <img src="./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" /> ) and some Alt sets might actually be bad dumps which got incorrectly labeled, and they will need further investigations to be sorted out. 
<br />However, I think the current list is not that bas as a starting point, given that 95% of the games shows something when loaded <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />
<br />
<br />Concerning included file, you might notice that the xml list does not contain hacks or translations: this is done in purpose, since in my opinion these should be made available as IPS patches (to be applied at loading time, after the separate prg &amp; chr have been loaded into memory). On the other hand, dumps from pirate carts are included.
<br />
<br />Finally, concerning the file availability (a not so trivial question, given that it's what basically killed the nice UNIF format), conversion from iNES &amp; UNIF is pretty easy since it mainly consists of splitting PRG and CHR chunks from the existing files: MESS is already capable of dumping out the data when the user loads one of his files, if required, and rommanager programs like clrmame or romvault can use the xml list to create zip archives with the correct names from the split files. Also, there is a group of users actively splitting the files so that ready-to-use zipfiles might <em>appear</em> soon-ish through rom collector websites. I'm not sure this will be enough to gain some momentum,
<br />but I hope I can find some more people not exactly happy with the iNES format and the arbitrary mapper numbers <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />
<br />
<br />Of course, I'd be interested in feedback and suggestions (as well as critics, of course) and I'm ready to answer to any question which might arise.
<br />
<br />That's all folks. Thanks for reading. Cheers.</div>

<br />If you want to handle them like MAME handles clones, a zipfile with an IPS in it would have the main ROM as its parent.

						<div class="postbody">I think moving past INES is an important thing for the future. However I'm not sure some XML + rom thing is the best way forward. Firstly it doesn't help either emulator authors or end users. With no standardized compression/format for the actual ROM data we will still be left to support a myriad of formats for the data, or a format such as ZIP which is antiquidated. Who wants RAR, ZIP, 7ZIP, TAR, GZ, etc support in every single emulator? It's a waste.
<br />
<br />Secondly, it seems XML is favoured because of the ability to 'be liquid' in the future when it comes to adding new features. Considering the games we are covering here are almost 30 years old, we pretty much know what they contain, the best solution is to have people spend the hundreds of hours necessary to write appropriate things for each game, and bundling data into appropriate containers. Not adding simple INES -&gt; XML converters which do nothing except change the data into another form.
<br />
<br />Any solution which doesn't involve some people spending the hundreds of hours going over  each game isn't really a solution and will never take off. I know from my experience with RetroCopy and the new .GAME format, without people helping you with the databases there is pretty much no point in trying a new format.
<br />
<br />As a developer I look at what you have done etabeta and go, what do I get out of it? If you can't offer developers a positive benefit they aren't going to take a new thing up. MESS isn't like MAME in that it can dictate formats as very few people actually use it. Without proper consultation of developers it's pretty much going to be like running on a treadmill any time you waste on such an endeavor.</div>

						<div class="postbody"><div class="quotetitle">etabeta wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">eventually, I'd be interested to add homebrew programs which run on the real hardware</div><br />With PowerPak becoming more widespread, it's far more common for homebrew to work as advertised on an NES.<br /><br />Because a homebrew game might be released early and often, a database (or section) designed for homebrew should probably not list outdated dumps. For example, <a href="http://pdroms.de/files/711/" class="postlink">the entry for LJ65 on pdroms.de</a> lists only the latest version (0.41). But common ROM cataloging tools are designed for commercial games, and far more prototypes can be found for a homebrew game than for a commercial game. The database might end up with entries for versions 0.01, 0.02, 0.03, 0.04, ..., 0.45, 0.46 of a program, as if they were alternate dumps. It becomes complicated when cataloging tools such as GoodNES include a function to spit out NESMiss.txt, a report listing ROMs in the database that the tool could not find. The presence of outdated dumps in the default view of NESMiss.txt encourages people to try to collect a "compl33t GoodNES set!!!11" including every outdated prototype version ever released. That's why the copyright screens of very early versions of LJ65 (formerly Tetramino) included notices to the maintainer of GoodNES that they weren't yet ready for wide distribution, let alone for the database.<br /><br />And while researching this reply, I found your post in a <a href="http://www.allgoodthings.us/mambo/index.php?option=com_simpleboard&amp;Itemid=42&amp;func=view&amp;id=272&amp;catid=5" class="postlink">discussion on how NESMiss.txt expresses excluded ROM categories</a>.

<br />
<br />I'm not trying to dictate anything and I would really like to know where you did take this impression from... 
<br />I was unsatisfied with iNES and displeased that neither UNIF nor iNES2.0 were getting success. I looked for inspiration in NEStopia (with its emulation based on the board types and its internal xml db) and in bootgod's website, and I pushed their approach to the extreme consequences because it matched my needs, my background and MESS capabilities.
<br />
<br />Once the list was ready, I thought the result could be of interested for other developers as well. I also added the controller and dipswitch settings, that MESS cannot even use at the moment, because they could be of use for some other (better) emulator. that's all.
<br />
<br />I don't expect iNES to be dropped at all (and indeed MESS will always keep supporting it). hence if you don't like xml, feel free to ignore it.</div>

<br />
<br />I'm not advising a 100% closed solution is possible at this point, however it seems to me most of what you have done is automation with a few tweaks on top. You can't take your few hours? of work and expect it to matter much when hundreds, likely thousands of hours is required.
<br />
<br />You are merely fixing small issues with INES, you aren't helping to cover all cases needed by emulators going forward. Unless you have a complete solution that fixes all issues and improves on nearly every aspect of INES I can't see how you can champion a minor improvement that no emulator supports. For something that RetroCopy requires I don't see any real benefits for me to convert, and that to me is what matters. Until you cover all the cases that *I* need, which is a rather advanced setting, you won't have a good replacement for INES.
<br />
<br />That said, I welcome any improvements you can do because my helpers will be taking everything they can when they add NES support to .GAME <img src="./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /> Or alternatively if you do want to get serious about it I welcome a complete solution, I'd prefer not to be the one that does all the work (or manages it rather).</div>

<br />please be so kind to give me some examples of *all* the cases you think you will encounter and I will happily take a look at them... until then, I still think a 1:1 representation of the cart hardware (as the separate files + xml &lt;fearure&gt; fields allow) is way more effective than .GAME <img src="./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" /></div>

<br />I am very thankful of those that have spent their time trying to improve the NES scene in any way possible, even your attempt here. I welcome change.
<br />
<br />However if you spent 6 months coming up with what you did you haven't worked optimally in my opinion. In reality whatever work you've done is going to be mostly wasted because what you offer isn't a complete solution for emulators going forward. REsolving the problems of the 1990s isn't going to help those of us in 2010.</div>

<br />
<br />I had a goal in mind and I reached it with the easier solution I could think of (a solution which makes wonder for ~9000 games in MAME). 
<br />this same solution would also allow people with the right instruments like bootgod to repair broken carts. is this enough for me? yes, in my eyes it is.
<br />
<br />That said, I'm not interested in converting anyone to see separate PRG &amp; CHR as a revolution. 
<br />They just represent an alternative approach to iNES. In particular, an approach capable to address most past complaints and all my needs in MESS. And an approach publicly available to anyone who wants to use it.
<br />
<br />If no one wants to use it, ok, I'm still happy with the result I obtained for the reasons I listed above. In the end it's just an hobby <img src="./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" /></div>
