It basically always draw the dark shape where it is, and it draws the moving piece at a specific location + a decrementing variable for the X coord.  This is just a demo of the frame changing concept working. Once I get a decent format, I can start making my movies!
<br />
<br />Though size worries me a little. A one-minute movie might take up a great deal of space. But like we were saying, it is possible to make use of objects to reduce the amount of space eaten up.
<br />
<br />I might also work with attributes to get a little color capability. Though it would be very limited, it could work. And also, it wouldn't take up that much space. I like this idea.
<br />
<br />In the future, I might even add support for polygonal sprites! This would require a fair bit of work though. But it would be great for things passing over the BG that aren't the same color if I use attributes. Though this could be a really big amount of work, it could be an amazing result.

<br />
<br />I don't know how many polygons an human creature would take but I bet at least 20 or something like that. If it takes you 9 frames to make 2 polygons, it would take 90 frames (1.5 sec) to draw a human model, which is way too long. I guess 0.5 sec would be a great maximum if you want to do any movie (it wouldn't look exeptional but still very impressive because it's the NES !).
<br />
<br />If you want to do movies you'd better have to store directly coordinates else you'll have to do 3D matrix transformations which certainly would slow things down a lot. You could also store only coordinates that changes or something like that.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />? 90 frames? No way! Maybe if I were drawing a line every frame!
<br />
<br />The longest it would ever take to completely update a game frame is about 9 hardware frames. It's 5 frames ALWAYS to update the PPU data. Then it's 1-3 (usually 1) frames to draw the polygons in SRAM. 3 would be really complex frames. So actually, 3+5 = 8. 60/8 = 7.5 FPS. If I were drawing REALLY REALLY complex frames, the worst FPS would be like 6 FPS.
<br />
<br />And my movies are stored 2 dimensionally. It'll be 5 bytes for a completely new line, and 3 if I am starting where I ended drawing the last line.
<br />
<br />Thanks for telling me about the register! I completely didn't think about that. I'll go fix it now.
<br />
<br />EDIT: Okay, so this one will work in NEStopia:

<br />
<br />Though I couldn't get it to run in 1.09, I got it working in 1.40, which I'm pretty sure is adequate. Also, NESTen runs it now, as it didn't before.
<br />
<br />I tested it in several emulators, and it runs perfectly in NEStopia, FCEUXD, Nintendulator, Nessie, VirtuaNES, and I'm sure others that I didn't test. But I tested it in NESTen, NNNesterJ, and JNES, and the screen jumps around. Would this be a result of inaccurate emulating of setting the Y scroll midframe?
<br />
<br />Oh, but surprise surprise, NESticle doesn't emulate this very well XD!
<br />
<br />If it works perfectly in NEStopia, FCEUXD, and Nintendulator, is that a sign that the timing is adequate?

<br />About the scrolling I guess you should just write $0000 to $2006 right before enabling the screen and you should be okay (since you don't scroll). Possibly write $0400 to get the second nametable if you don't do a $2000 write afterward.

<br />
<br /><img src="http://www.freewebs.com/the_bott/Polygon.png" alt="Image" />
<br />
<br />The ROM that produced this image:

<br />
<br />It will look a lot better once I have a program that will make it easier. But I think it's pretty cool for being all polygons with 1 palette!
<br />
<br />I plan to have a shot like this, but when I add support for sprites (Both polygonal and predefined (I'll also add support for predefined BG tiles)), I plan to have the moon behind the building with clouds moving by that will appear behind the BG. These, I will probably have predefined, as the moon wouldn't look good made like an octagon. Though perhaps I'd have polygonal clouds to have that "glass" effect when they pass over the moon.
<br />
<br />I worry though that it may look too much like cut out construction paper like the cartoon South Park. But I think this won't be as much of an issue once I have it actually moving "3-dimensionally".
<br />
<br />EDIT: Oh, and this frame between 2 planes is 255 bytes (coincidence). It's 146 for color plane 1, and 99 for color plane 2. If this were all predefined, it would be much larger! There are some parts where I needlessly define "Start of new polygon" and stuff like that, so it's probably more like 245 bytes. It should also be noted that each plane separately has a maximum size of 255 (or 256, I don't know, I have trouble with the whole counting starts at 0 thing sometimes) bytes, so frames can be fairly complex. Though there's always 3 bytes used in the first plane, and 1 in the second. 1 in each is to define the number of lines being drawn.

However, I am concerned about tile usage... when I look at the tiles that were generated for this picture, I can see that 3/4 of the pattern table were used, even though the image looks pretty simple, with lots of flat areas. It might be hard to keep them inside the limits once there are characters moving around and all that.
<br />
<br />BTW, how do you know when to reuse tiles and when to create new ones? I'm really curious about that! Are only the first 4 reused or is there a more complex system?

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />This is one of the problems with the engine... I really don't think I have enough CPU time to sacrifice to check and see if I can reuse tiles for things like completely horizontal/vertical lines. Though there is somewhat of a solution, and I use it for things like the tree trunks.
<br />
<br />Only the first four tiles are reused, yes. If I have large polygons that are filled with one solid color, it would be a really bad idea to use all "unique" tiles to do it. So I use those 4 tiles for solid areas in the middle of a large polygon. And also, I define absolutely no completely vertical lines. In order to define a square, I have to define the top and bottom borders of it. If I make it start at  an X coordinate that's a multiple of 8, and if I make it a multiple of 8 pixels wide, I can fill it with those solid tiles all the way down besides the top/bottom lines. This saves tiles, and I do it with the tree trunks. Check all the tiles in FCEUXD; They are almost completely made up of one of the first 4 tiles.
<br />
<br />But in a lot of cases, I can fine tune the graphics to use less tiles. If I have a line with a slope of 1, there is one condition where it can use half as many tiles as it ever does. If the line cuts exactly across the tile from the top left corner to the bottom right, then it will use much less tiles. If it's slightly off, it will use twice as many! There are many tricks like this to reduce the amount of space used.
<br />
<br />I'll most likely program my application to warn me if all tiles are used up, or anything like that. But most of the frames will have side-by-side polygons sharing many tiles. So this isn't SO much of an issue right now. I don't plan to have REALLY complex frames, as this isn't so possible with only 256 tiles.
<br />
<br />Oh, and it also helps that there are lots of long horizontal lines in this, and I currently have to define every one with unique tiles. However, I have an idea for a solution of this. I'll have a special command in my line definitions that tells to draw a row or column of solid tiles instead of using unique tiles. Though this would take an extra byte as a line definition, it would save me lots of pattern table space.

<br />You should learn how to use blender. I gess there is a lot of tutorials in english. I also found a tutorial in french I'm going to use to learn at least the basics. When I get the basics done if I want to move further I could switch to more complex english tutorials, but I don't want to deal with that now.

<br />I guess you shouldn't draw clouds and moon at the same time. If you have ever looked the sky during the night, you'll probably notice that clouds are invisible you only notice the "absence of stars" in that direction (of course not technially the absence of stars but you don't see them).
<br />
<br />Oh and it's possible to have the sky during daytime with clouds and the moon, but it would look stupid without the sun then, altough it would be possible to have the moon on the north and the sun invisible on the south, and cloud arround it, so that would be possible.

<br />
<br />Oh, and also, there are very few actual polygons in this picture. The engine doesn't care as much about the number of polygons as it does the number of lines. In fact, any polygons that are the same color that appear to be overlapping are not 2 separate polygons, but 1 big polygon.
<br />
<br />EDIT: Okay, so I've done a little modification to save tiles by adding support for drawing rows of solid tiles. Also, I can't believe I missed this, but I wasn't correctly starting a new column when I was filling, so it was as if I were filling one big column for the whole thing! So I fixed this, and now I can "cheat" by not defining the bottom border of a polygon if it's off screen. This uses less tiles and line defs! So have a look just at what impact the little modifications I did had:

<br />That uses much less tiles! Though I don't want to right now, this image could be heavily modified to use WAY less tiles now that I have my routine. For instance, the top part of the building could be a row of solid tiles instead of unique ones. Though they act just like lines do. I can't just leave a row by itself. I would like to take the chimney top and use solid tiles instead of unique ones, but it would start filling all the way down the screen, which would be bad.
<br />
<br />But it can't be TOO modified, otherwise the movies will look really strange if everything "snaps" to tile boundries and whatnot.

<br />make a demo of a dotted line wireframe seashell, a multi-colored spinning icosahedron, along with a third animated scene of a set of eight octahedrons orbiting a center point passing in front of each other.
<br />
<br />This is some of what i did in the first VGA graphics demo i did for PC using QBasic called '19990328.EXE'.
<br />
<br />in order to render a convex polyhedron all you need to do is test whether the vertices are clockwise or counter-clockwise per triangle and only render ones that are clockwise on the screen.
<br />
<br />then for multiple convex polyhedrons you need to split triangles into 2 or 3 new triangles every time two triangles intersect in 3d space, and use an algorithm to only draw triangles that aren't completely engulfed by other polyhedrons.
<br />
<br />you need to also for concave polyhedrons, figure out how to split them into multiple convex polyhedrons.
<br />
<br />also you need to figure out how to skip rendering any triangles that are completely masked by other triangles.
<br />
<br />also you need to figure out how to shave off pieces of triangles that do not need to be rendered.
<br />
<br />beyond that it is simple gourad dithering and texturing.
<br />
<br />forget lighting effects on the nes, btw.
<br />
<br />you need "QBasic" 1.1 for this, use GliDOS, DOSBOX won't work with the palette rotation.
<br />
<br />"Quick Basic" 4.5 might work, but "QBX" PDS 7.1/7.2 isn't compatible with the source code.
<br />
<br /><a href="http://mediaplague.com/projects/jargon/19990328/MS-QBX/source/19990328%20%28QBX%29%20%28full%20src%29.LZMA.7z" class="postlink">http://mediaplague.com/projects/jargon/19990328/MS-QBX/source/19990328%20%28QBX%29%20%28full%20src%29.LZMA.7z</a>
<br />
<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">19990328.BAS<br />3DFLOOR8.BAS</div>
<br />
<br />are the two major source codes to look at.
<br />
<br />3DFLOOR8.BAS does a majora's mask style effect that i just happened to independently create unaware of each other's project the same time nintendo did it.
<br />
<br />why no emu uses this effect by interpolating 3 to 7 frames of the same pixels on top of each other using a weighted average instead of using frame-skip, i have no idea.
<br />
<br />with this method you don't have to render the entire screen per frame.
<br />
<br />reminds me of windows 3.11 'mouse trails', only a lot cooler looking.

My guess is he isn't, because his goal for this engine is not to make one of those "super cool mega demos", he's actually trying to be original and make movies of things that actually resemble things you'd find in a real (or fantasy) world, like the entities in an actual a game.
<br />
<br />When you start talking like that it just seems you are showing off, trying to make us see the cool stuff you have made. But instead, you end up looking like a dick who thinks he knows more than everyone else.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I will admit, those demos are extremely cool! The best thing I've made on QBasic was my wireframe 3D simulator. It was like yours, but it didn't have mouse support or different colors. But you could spin the models around and move them all about. Oh, and there was no polygon filling as I didn't know how to do any at the time.
<br />
<br />But my polygon engine wouldn't be able to do those simply because it assumes everything is pre-defined. And overlapping polygons of the same color cause major issues with the filling routine. I originally planned on having 3D sequences, but then over the course of about 6 months I concluded several things about this weren't necessary for making a polygonal sequences.
<br />
<br />Making a demo like that on the NES would be cool, but like tokumaru said, I'm not into making random demos that I'm not going to use for anything besides just being a demo.

<br />Celius, I assume your rendering engine reads the data using a pointer, right? Theoretically, you could generate a dynamic scene to RAM and have your engine render that data. The only problems I see are the extra time needed to create the scene (too much time is already spent rendering it), and the lack of complexity checks (to make sure no more than 256 tiles are used).

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Yes, my engine uses a pointer to get the data. Several, actually. But it is theoretically possible to do real 3D rendering with my engine, though it'd be terribly slow and the complex checks would take way too long. It'd run at like a frame a second, probably XD.
<br />
<br />Also, the display area is 160 scanlines large. There are 40 on top and bottom that aren't visible. This isn't a very good looking display area for a game. It would be a headache to play, probably. It's fine for movies, since it makes it more cinematic like widescreen.
