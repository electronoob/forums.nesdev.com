<br />If the guy wants to destroy the cart to turn it into something that for him is obviously more important, just let him, it's not like his decision will change anyone else's lives.

<br />Even if you weren't kidding, what would be the difference between the cart being locked in a guy's basement and the cart not existing? For the rest of the world, none, because nobody would have the cart anyway. The only person that sees any difference is the one that owns the cart, so it should be up to him what to do with it.

<br />Yeah, I get that, but what difference does it make to <strong>you</strong>? You won't have the cart either way, so why bother? It's exactly the same as if it didn't exist.
<br />
<br />If someone really considers a cart to be so important, they should be trying to buy it from the current owner so that they can "guard" the carts themselves. If that's not an option, I don't see why bother the current owner.

For me it's almost as if people came and asked for ROMs. However, the second case is stricly forbidden, while the first one is very common here. Why ?<br />I guess all posts about making bootlegs of commercial games should be systematically deleted or at least locked by the moderators. Posts to make dev-carts for nesdev purposes should be tolerated, of course. If people REALLY wants to make bootlegs the least they could do is lie and say they are making devcards so it looks legal.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">I started to buy old stuff just recently, I don't have so much money to say that 30usd is not "that expensive"!

<br />You can probably get a random TLROM game for about $3 in most countries.

<br />I have read many topics about why not destroy games to make other games. Simillar to that are people that buy Sonic and Knuckles cart just to rip out the connector for their Radica mod. 
<br />But ok, I will change my plans if you are saying that this particular game isn't a common one. Haven't got a clue about that. I newer wanted to destroy a not common game. Really. Japanese only RPG's are something that I never have considered rare. I think it's obvious for somebody not able to read japanese texts.
<br />
<br /><strong>EDIT:</strong>
<br />ok I've scratched the project, can at least somebody tell me whitch ips patch should I apply to the original J rom to have the MMC3 version, untranslated and closest to the real thing? thanks (I already mutilated one SMB3 cartridge for SMB2j so this one is lost anyway)

<br />I agree. I was proud when I made my first devcart (4 or so years ago), even though it doesn't seem like that big of a deal nowadays. So don't put him down for that.
<br />
<br />Also agree with tokumaru.

<br />And I don't think anyone else here was all up in arms about this either. We are just pointing out the trend of people destroying cartridges that have a finite number for the purpose of building worthless bootlegs.
<br />
<br />Sounds to me like you just want a MMC3 version of Contra that is not translated? I think Bregalad can do that for you.
