<br />I agree. At first I throught it was SCV4 that was the sequel to Dracula X so I throught it was decent, but when I learded it was released 5 years later, and that they reverted the controls all the way back to what it was in the SNES days, I just don't understand. The graphcis are kind of washed out too (not that they're bad but they are better in SCV4). The music is great through. The gameplay is especially horrible, and it's SO difficult just because of how stupidly the whip and jumps works, if it would be like CV4 this game would be a piece of cake to beat.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />To be clear, Dracula X on SNES is a port/remake of Dracula X Rondo of Blood for PC-Engine. It came out on PC-Engine Super CD-ROM 2 years after Super Castlevania on Super Famicom. The only reason I can see for the Super Famicom port of Dracula X (somewhere between 1 and a half to two years later) was probably to reach a greater audience. 
<br />
<br />Personally I think the SNES Dracula X is a solid game on its own. It's different in many ways from the source material but it's not really bad. It definitely seems out of place with the timing from our perspective. But if you take it for what it is, it's not a bad game.

<br />
<br />Bregalad said it looks better than Dracula X, and thought SCV4 came out later.
<br />
<br />I don't really know why he thinks that, SCV4 looks pretty blocky, the colors look kind've clumped together onscreen, and the sound quality is nowhere as clear.

<br />
<br />SCV4 is worth a few dollars in japan. On the other hand, dracula X is more expensive to get (either version , snes/pc-engine), so is the megadrive version.  Do the math.

This might not even be a fair comparison, considering the time between the two games, which makes it even crazier the fact that someone thinks SCV4 looks better.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">Banshaku wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">SCV4 is worth a few dollars in japan.

<br />Personally I don't think this means anything. There's hardly a direct connection between how good an old game is and how much it costs, sellers usually go with stupid things like availability or other shit invented by stupid collectors.

<br />You'd think so, but I met a crazy seller once that charged more for SMB3 just because it was "Mario", you know, the big-name company mascot.

The lower half of stage 5' was absolutely psychotically difficult, though. Much harder than the top half with that awesome Hydra boss.
