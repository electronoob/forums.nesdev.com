<br />Man, I don't know why you still hang around with the guy... I wouldn't care if he's family or not, if the guy is as troublesome as you make it seem I wouldn't want to have anything to do with him.

<br />Hmm, yeah, but I still think it's better than AVG, but that's ME anyway. ^_^;; Any suggestion, other than AVG?

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Well, being rather impulsive I've already reverted to windows XP. I don't have the patience required to get linux to, for example, play sound properly, or another example, use vsync in my favorite emulators =D.  What I'm realizing is, if you want linux to work as well as windows you have to make it a hobby. I already have a couple of time consuming hobbies, one of which has nothing to do with computers. So, I'm willing to pay Microsoft $$$ to give me an OS that just bloody works =)  Linux is getting startlingly close to an os that "just works" but it isn't *quite* there yet! (at least not for what I use it for---for people who just want to browse the internet and use facebook I'd say its there)
