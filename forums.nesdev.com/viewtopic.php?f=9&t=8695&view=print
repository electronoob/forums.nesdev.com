<br />
<br />Escape from Atlantis is Mapper 11, 64kb PRG/CHR, Captain Comic is Mapper 11, 64kb PRG/CHR
<br />
<br />Thanks

Unless it's not produce a fake prototype which would be very lame. I've heard that if you play Escape from Atlantis more than 5 min, a small japanese girl will come out of the TV and punch you in the family jewels... It might be an urban legend but why risk it? <img src="./images/smilies/icon_lol.gif" alt=":lol:" title="Laughing" />

<br />
<br />Okay, here's pics of the PCB... maybe a trace is bad or something?  The original game worked fine before, I have a feeling something is wrong with the PCB, possibly when I took the chips out. Pin holes?  Any help is appreciated, thanks a lot!

Because if you haven't disabled the CIC on your NES I can imagine you might have problems.  I don't know the details on how thier CIC stun works but I know it's driven by the games' code and that might not be compatible between boards with possible different stun circuits.

<br />
<br />Just re-make the connection with some wire.  As long as things are electrically connected properly and there are no shorts it doesn't matter that the pad is missing.
<br />
<br />EDIT: it's hard to see in the picture.  But it looks like the only one that is detrementally broke is PRG ROM pin 13.  Looks like you pulled up the pad and there were two connections being made there.

<br />
<br />So I just solder wire directly onto the EPROM pin from a trace of the broken pinhole pad?
<br />
<br />Oh wow, pin 13 definitely, the trace is gone for like a centimeter...
<br />
<br />Thanks for the help guys <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />

<br />
<br />Yeah just manually make the connections with wire that used to be done by the traces which are now lifted.
