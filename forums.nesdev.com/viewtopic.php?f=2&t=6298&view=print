		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />So I finally got sick of converting bitmaps with a pen and paper and wrote a script to do it for me.
<br />
<br />This script takes a bitmap, splits it down into whatever size meta-tiles you want, then outputs it into tile data you can include straight into your source code.
<br />
<br />It'll work with any size tiles you specify, the default is 16x16 but you can do 8x8, 16x16, 32x8, it'll even do 10x93 if you want it to. Just make sure your image is actually divisible by the tile size. If you split a 100x100 px image into 8x8 tiles, you'll get weird results.
<br />
<br />As always, I don't presume this is the best method of producing these results. This script is linux only and requires imagemagick to be installed. You can probably get it to run under cygwin, but you're on your own for that.
<br />
<br />I've included sample input and output if you want to try it out: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://cinematicbazaar.com/?p=111">http://cinematicbazaar.com/?p=111</a><!-- m -->
<br />
<br />There is one limitation to the script. If a meta-tile is only used once in the original bitmap, it won't be included in the data file. This was intentional to keep the script from counting the original bitmap as a tile itself. So make sure each tile is used at least twice and you'll be fine.
<br />
<br />I'm going to drag linux kicking and screaming into NES development one way or the other... even if I do have to write all my own tools.

<br />
<br />The artist i'm working with uses photoshop to create the original background design, i use GIMP to edit them. He gives me images that look like this: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://cinematicbazaar.com/images/BioForceApe/Level1.bmp">http://cinematicbazaar.com/images/BioFo ... Level1.bmp</a><!-- m -->
<br />
<br />then i convert them into data. The next step will be to add in a hybrid RLE compression so the script's output will be exactly the same as my engine's input.

<br />
<br />I haven't used photoshop, and gimp just a little bit, so maybe it's easier than I think, but it seems like placing tiles in a normal kind of pixel-based editor would have potential for off-by-one errors all over the place.  Also seems like it would be a pain to change the character set used (as displayed in the editor), that's something that's useful to do.

<br />
<br />I just needed a tool to take the files he gives me and turn them into data files.
<br />
<br />I haven't really run into off-by-one errors working on the files. Turning on a grid and "snap-to-grid" keep most things in line. Basically the process we use is to design the 16x16 meta-tiles, then just copy+paste them into place to assemble the background. The system works pretty well for us, but it may not be for everyone.

From that, I could create meta tiles. From the meta tile, I created meta-meta tile. Then with the result I could draw maps.  Once all meta-tiles are defined, drawing/prototyping was quite fast. Then once the map was over, I export the data in the format I needed.

<br />Ahhh, so that's what were discussing here. Years and years back when I was trying to make a game I had to write this kind of thing, because I ran into the same issue. It sucked to have to spend so much time on a support tool.

<br />That's what I do when editing level maps using GIMP. You can set the grid size to whatever your (meta)tiles' dimensions are.
