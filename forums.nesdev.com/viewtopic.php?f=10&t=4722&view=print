<br />
<br />But yeah, my site will have my homebrew projects information on it eventually, but if you go there it currently says that construction will continue tomorrow, but that really means just some time soon. My most important project is "ChateauLeVania", taking place at a castle underneath a resort called "Chateau LeVeaux", and it's a spoof on Castlevania.

<br />
<br />You could try PDROMS, but a lot of those have never been tested on an NES but only on the emulators that were current when they were developed. Prior to the rise of more accurate emus starting with FCE Ultra and culminating with Nestopia and Nintendulator, it was a crapshoot whether would a rom would even do anything on an NES. I'm just glad I was able to snag a PowerPak.
