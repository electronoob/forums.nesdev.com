		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Hi all
<br />
<br />Im new to this and i am very interrested and exited to start, i just have a some questions. I hope that someone can help me.
<br />1 - How much of the rom file header must i remove. I read 16kb somewhere and 8kb somewhere else.
<br />2 - Do you have to completely fill the eproms that you put on the cart
<br />3 - Is it possible to create your own mapper chips to put on the cart - (it is a bit difficult for me to find some of the carts where i live.)
<br />4 - How difficult would it be to make a multi-game NROM cart
<br />I would really appreciate any help. Thanks <img src="./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" />

<br />2) No, but you must be sure unprogrammed ROM will not be accessed
<br />3) Yes but if you have to ask this, you are nowhere near ready. First learn some digital design and NES carts. Then you may be able to come up with mappers through discrete design or synthisization with programmable logic. After that though, you still need to be able to build a PCB which is by far the most difficult and costly step. Regardless, it would be far easier/cheaper for you to order NES/FC carts overseas if you cannot find the mapper you are looking for.
<br />4) Not very since NROM has no provisions for CROM bankswitching and all all games use at least 8k CHR, the maximum for NROM. You should be able to squeeze two 16k PRG games onto a CNROM or four 8k PRG games if that many even exist however.

Normally the PRG/CHR data match an EPROM size exactly. You can have larger EPROMs and tie the additionnal adress input to GND, but that is a bit odd I think.<br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">3 - Is it possible to create your own mapper chips to put on the cart - (it is a bit difficult for me to find some of the carts where i live.) </div><br />Again, I'm unsure what you're asking. It is possible to "cheat" and to mod a board to another. For example it is possible to rewire an UNROM board to have it behaving like AOROM, but this needs a lot of rewiring.<br />Or are you asking making your own board with you own circuit doing the memory mapping ? Memblers did that several times.<br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">4 - How difficult would it be to make a multi-game NROM cart </div>
<br />You mean multi-game on a NROM card, or multi NROM games on a card ? The first one is impossible because NROM has no PRG nor CHR bankswitching. The second is quite easy I think. Just write your own "menu" programm, and when a game is selected, swap the good PRG and CHR banks, and jump to its reset vector.

<br />
<br />about the size of the EPROM. i want to start with nroms since it seems like the esiest ones to start with. I know the 32k PRG rom will fit onto a 27c256 Eprom, but the 8k CHR rom wont fill the whole EPROM, as i understand it, i could be wrong. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" />

<br />If you really only have 27C256 on your hand, you can just ground the two supperior adress bits, but I'm unsure if both types have the exact same pinout those two pins aside. If that is not the case, you'll need additionnal modifications.
<br />And yeah, black-blobs boards are unusable and annoying. Only multicards ever used it (both licenced and pirate), as far I know.

<br />But AFAIK it would be possible to make a cheap NROM multicart using a relatively easy modification to a CNROM board. Wire the CHR ROM bank lines to the PRG ROM upper lines, so that the same bank number controls both 8 KB banks of the 32 KB CHR and 32 KB banks of the 128 KB PRG.

<br />You can also just fill the upper banks with the same data.
<br />
<br />so if you have an 8KB rom for a 27C64, and you have a 27C256 just do:
<br />
<br />copy /b 8k.rom+8k.rom+8k.rom+8k.rom 32k.rom
<br />
<br />and burn the 32k.rom to the 27C256.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Another way of making a simple multicart (regardless of mapper) would be to use an EPROM that's larger.  Put several games on there, then have the extra address lines connected to something like a DIP switch.  Then you can pick a different game while the NES is off, no menu.
<br />
<br />As for making a mapper, you can wire up some standard logic chips to make a simple one.  Ones like MMC1 &amp; MMC3 are custom chips though, in those cases you'd be better off finding carts that have them.
<br />
<br />Yeah, you can't really use the ones with the black blobs.  Unless it has a normal ROM you could replace, but I doubt that.
<br />
<br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">You don't have to ground the upper address lines.</div>
<br />But you don't want to leave them unconnected, either.  So either VCC or GND would be good.  I imagine almost any board will already tie unused input pins to VCC.

<br />
<br />Memblers : I tried the switch thing some time ago. I had wanted to make a Double Dragon / Castlevania II multicart with an original Castlevania II board. Unfortunately I failed. Castlevania II was running correctly, but the graphics were totally glitchy. Double Dragon were running the title screen with terrible glitchy screen as well, but crashed when the game was starting. I think that was because I burned the NTSC verion. And also, now I think I tried to fix it, and definitely broke the cart. Also I wasn't able to re-close the game pack, and that wasn't very handfull to play.
<br />Eventually I think I just grabbed back and erased the EPROMs, and throw away the PCB. That wasn't a good idea for my first hardware project. Fortunatly, my following hardware projects had turned better.

<br />
<br />This is what I've always done, and it works just fine.
<br />
<br />As for removing headers, I use CajoNES. It's an awesome little program. You can download it here: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.snakeyes.org/util/nes.php">http://www.snakeyes.org/util/nes.php</a><!-- m -->
<br />
<br />When you run it, simply open the selected ROM and you'll get a list of options. Select "Output Pasofami PRM/PRG/CHR". It will generate the CHR and PRG files in the same folder for you. The header is removed and the files are ready to burn (or copy, as explained above, to fill the eeprom).
