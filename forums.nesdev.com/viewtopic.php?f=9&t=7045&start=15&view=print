<br />
<br />
<br />But I am guessing that only 1 CHR-ROM line will be connected and the rest just grounded or whatever? a ground pulls low, right? Or is it floating?
<br />
<br />
<br />What pins on the MMC1 do you want me to test exactly?
<br />
<br />
<br />And like I asked before, how much do revision numbers matter in the wiring of the cart?

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />You should check pins 9-11, especially pin 11. Pins 9 and 10 (A14 and A15) very likely go to pins on the CHR-ROM, that are unused by DW, but are here for support up to 64kb CHR-ROM.
<br />
<br />Pin 11 (A16) however, is what I'd want you to look where it leads... On MMC1 boards with 128kb CHR-ROM this is A16, on SUROM it is the main 256k page switch and on SNROM it is a second WRAM enable.... so I'm very curious about if it is used on SAROM.
<br />
<br />I don't think revisions matters in any way, usually they just changed the layout of the traces and componant, not the shematics. The only place I remember they changed something on the same board was that they added a capactiy on SNROM-04 and + to make saves more reliable than SNROM-03 and -
<br />
<br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">a ground pulls low, right? Or is it floating?</div>
<br />Ground pulls low, and unconnected is floating. Unused inputs are usually pulled low or high (ground or VCC respecively), while unused outputs should be left floating.
<br />
<br />EDIT / PS : The fact that A16 was sometimes connected to WRAM /CE was already doccumented, at least from Kevtirs's site, and even the nesdev wiki. It's just that nobody really noticed it.

<br />
<br />
<br />UPDATE:
<br />
<br />(MMC1 Pin)-(Where)
<br />A12-Pin 2 on CHR-ROM
<br />A13-Pin 26 on CHR-ROM
<br />A14-Pin 27 on CHR-ROM
<br />A14-Pin 1 on CHR-ROM
<br />A16-Seems to go nowhere.
<br />
<br />
<br />It seems that these are all the right pins by looking at the MASK ROM pinouts on the sheet.....do I pass? <img src="./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" />
<br />
<br />
<br />EDIT AGAIN:
<br />
<br />Just opened up my Zelda 2 cart and tested A16, It does go to the SRAM pin 20 for enabling. Well, since I am figuring this junk out, time to attempt to make a SUROM board....if I can find the parts.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />So yeah, A16 is usunsed and doesn't go to the WRAM enable. That's all I wanted to know, thank you very much.
<br />
<br />EDIT : Oh and does anyone have a SJROM board ? Like SAROM, the upper CHR line is unused, and could potentially be used for WRAM enable. Although if it's not on SAROM I doubt it is on SJROM but who knowns.
<br />
<br />EDIT 2 : Never mind I checked bootgod database, and the A16 line isn't connected on SJROM.

<br />
<br />
<br />And on the DW board, the pins that weren't used went off the board directly to the left of the chip looking at it from the 1 pin on the top left, so if you look at pictures, you might be able to see what is used and what is not easily.
