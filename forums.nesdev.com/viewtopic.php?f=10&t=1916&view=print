		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Hi. 
<br />
<br />I've been recently looking into things about the 6502 that I never really payed attention to, like comparing if something is greater or less than something else (Yeah, I really didn't know how to do that). And it was quite apparent that I needed to, so I did. Do not fear, I understand 6502 quite well, and I program with it. I'm not a newbie, there are just some dumb things like that that I've never really payed attention to. I've been wondering about reversing a byte, though. It seems like a complicated routine, but I was wondering if there was an easier way... What I mean by reversing a byte is this:
<br />
<br />Take this: 10010100
<br />
<br />And Make it: 00101001
<br />
<br />Does anyone know?

I looked at a routine that Tokumaru made, it was a hex to decimal routine. I still do not understand why that works. It'd do me well to understand why, I suppose. I was wondering about this for reversing graphics with CHR RAM. As in background tiles, not sprites. I know how to do that. Thanks though!

<br />Oh, but that wastes alot of space... It's like the MMC1 bankswitching technique:
<br />
<br />lda #$XX
<br />sta $E000
<br />lsr a
<br />sta $E000
<br />lsr a
<br />sta $E000
<br />lsr a
<br />sta $E000
<br />lsr a
<br />sta $E000
<br />
<br />I just do:
<br />
<br />ldx #5
<br />lda #$XX
<br />-
<br />sta $E000
<br />lsr a
<br />dex
<br />bne -
<br />
<br />I like to save space, beings as we work with such a space-unplentiful system.

<br />
<br />A programmer would obviously let the computer build the above bit reversing table. Even if tedium weren't an issue, building it by hand would be error-prone. But the above doesn't matter, since above we have the table ready for copy-and-paste above.

<br />
<br />For just one tile, I'd agree.  But if this is going to be a common occurance, that is a <em>major</em> waste of processing time.
<br />
<br />Q's loop takes 100 cycles
<br />tepples' unrolled loop takes 59 cycles
<br />
<br />using a lookup table with:
<br />
<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">tax<br />lda table,X<br /></div>
<br />
<br />takes a grand total of <em><strong>6</strong></em> cycles.
<br />
<br />This is not peanuts we're talking about here... the speed difference is astounding.  When you consider this process will have to be done SIXTEEN TIMES for a <em>single</em> tile to be flipped... we're talking major slowdowns.  using Q's loop and dedicating your <em>entire frame</em> to flipping tiles, you'll be able to convert maybe 18-19 tiles.  Whereas using a lookup table... 19 tiles can be converted in roughtly 2000 cycles (~17.5 scanlines)

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />This is true. It really does make a huge difference in speeds. I think the lookup table is a good idea if you need it to be fast, but if you are leaving the screen black for about 1 second (60 frames), I think you can handle saving the space. When you're making an RPG, you MUST conserve as much space as possible. Especially when you have 350+ maps, a huge world map, a ton of graphical data, and all this text and all these events going on in your game, you really don't want to dedicate 256 bytes to anything that could possibly be shrinked down to about 20 or so. Wasting space is not a good thing to do. I say go with the table if you're making a game that moves fast, but if you're making an RPG, dude, save the space, and go with the small routine.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />If you're trying to conserve space in a program, optimizing tile flipping like this would be one of the last places to look (unless it's an entry to the 2K/4K competition or something). The savings is at most 256 bytes, which wouldn't be worth the time. Much better places are where the savings is multiplied by some large amount of data, like levels, graphics, or text. These are the areas where big savings can often be made as the data are rarely in the most compact form possible. Another possibility is an interpreted scripting language in place of some portions of machine code for games like Maniac Mansion where there's a significant amount of game logic that doesn't have to run continuously.
<br />
<br />The general point is that micro-optimization can obscure the big picture and opportunities for major optimization. The most productive areas for optimization are specific to each program. A particular program might arrange data in a way that allows for a major optimization that wouldn't be relevant in any other program.

<br />
<br />But yeah, like blargg said, optimize where it counts.  Don't sweat the little stuff.  Code size (including small-ish lookup tables) is usually nothing compared to data.  With 512kB, give yourself a 32kB bank for code, and probably the rest of the ROM for data.
