This thread doesn't really require priority over any other thread imo.<br /><br />For example I don't recall the controller reading bug getting a sticky and that was imo MORE important to development than this.

(One thing I have read about it on esolang wiki is that it uses a linear feedback shift register to advance the program counter, but that is all.) Perhaps it can be known, and assembler and emulator can be written too?

However, Tepples is correct in pointing out that the CIClone can only be used as a &quot;key&quot; (in a cartridge) and not as a &quot;lock&quot; (in a console).   A original CIC could operate either way (based on pin 4).  However, due to the region searching feature of the CIClone it certainly would not operate properly as a lock.<br />satchsatch33: why would you want to put a CIC into a console?  I can't think of a reason, other than as a repair of a damaged one.  In that case, it's way easier to just pull a CIC from an old cartridge.
