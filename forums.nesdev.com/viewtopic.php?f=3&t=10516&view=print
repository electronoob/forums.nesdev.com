More often than not (in my experience) all they do is introduce an added amount of latency; double buffering is perfectly fine if you ask me.  In all my years I've yet to see a single DirectX application using exclusively triple buffering that solves screen tearing.  (Note to those who want to debate me about this: you're wasting your time, I will not discuss it.  What I said is true and based on my entire experience in every single regard, including for commercial games, and your efforts debating/argument will be wasted time on your part)<br /><br />Proper Vsync can be accomplished.  Go look at the NES emulator that was just released (mentioned here on the forum) called kindred, it gets windowed mode Vsync correct on OSes like XP SP3 with DX9.  Ask him to describe his buffering + Vsync mechanism and/or provide some example code.  It's supposedly even easier to accomplish on DX10 (Vista onward); guys like James here on the forum has an emulator that does proper Vsync on DX10 and later.

Everybody has a different tale to tell about that one, but IMO the various tricks people claim &quot;work&quot; for this are just a kludge that works on their particular machine.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />From what I heard, you have to adjust the amount of samples to better match 60hz. You have to do some kind of scaling or buffering, I'm not sure though. All I remember is that the NES runs slightly faster than 60hz so if you generate the proper amount of audio samples, you have more samples that will be played back in the amount of time when using 60hz vsync. So depending on how you generate audio will determine what you can do to fix it. It's also possible to sync to your sound buffer/sound playing I believe. But it can be a tricky problem. The easy way out is to change how many audio samples are generated so you don't have that issue.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I post again here becouse i can't sync video and audio. I really don't understand very well those links.<br />Im using a DirectSound class that has a method called CanWrite() that returns the number of bytes free in the DSound buffer. What i did before was:<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">While (CanWrite() &lt; samples &lt;&lt; 1)<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Sleep(1);<br /></div><br />where &quot;samples&quot; were the samples generated in one frame comming from the APU, usually 735 APU samples and then shifted left by 1 since im using 16 bit samples. I did that every frame and i synced to sound. <br />I post in GameDev my problem and as i suspected they told me to create a separate thread for sound. <br />I created a thread that looks like:<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">for (;;) //loops forever for the thread<br />{<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; if (can_stream)&nbsp; &nbsp; <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; {<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; While (CanWrite() &lt; samples &lt;&lt; 1);&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;//waits samples free for the frame<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; WriteToDirectSoundBuffer(samples &lt;&lt; 1); //Actually write to DSound buffer<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; can_stream = 0;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; //reset can_stream flag<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; }<br />}<br /></div><br />Where &quot;can_stream&quot; is set to &quot;true&quot; every ending frame.<br /><br />Anyway, i have problems. Sometimes the sound sync, sometimes don't. It's ramdomly, i load a rom and if syncs sound is not disturbed, but if i load other rom it's not synced.<br />All this waiting for PC VSync before writing any samples to the buffer at the beginning of the frame.<br />Im waiting for PC VSync to then render graphics using a:<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">While( ! WaitForVSync())&nbsp; &nbsp;//if its &quot;true&quot; PC is in vsync<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Sleep(0);&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; //let other trheads do their tasks<br /></div><br />At the beginning of the frame.<br />Any help is preciated.

Buffering without sync can still be useful if you compose the scene in a roundabout fashion or draw things over others during composition. Triple-buffering is meant to reduce latency by allowing the producer to continuously generate frames, with the video system displaying the &quot;freshest&quot; one.
