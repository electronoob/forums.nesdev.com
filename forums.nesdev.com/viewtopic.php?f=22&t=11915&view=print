Rom space was one of those. Menu expansion was another. Font compression, crashes, inconsistencies in the translation. More stuff I probably shouldn't talk about. But I've been doing this long enough to know what the best solution was for most of the problems. This is the result. It was an awful lot of work though.

I would suspect that the FPGA is not even powerful enough to do so, FM synthesis is considerably more complex than audio used in other expansions. If that's to much for it, perhaps a wavetable based approximation good enough for Lagrange Point could be cooked up? I dunno.

There's a lot going on here compared to any of the other expansion audio devices.<br /><br />I dunno, maybe it's doable, I don't know the limits of the PowerPak's FPGA, but I think it could be out of scope. What's the reason it was never implemented? Everdrive N8 doesn't have a VRC7 emulation either.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />If I recall correctly the Mega Everdrive can provide the YM2413 for Master System games (and the VRC7 happens to use similar hardware for sound), so it seems to be feasible for a FPGA.<br /><br />The biggest problem would be where to connect it honestly. Like, doesn't the NES have the audio lines in the expansion port instead of the cartridge port? Making a companion hardware for the PowerPak (i.e. a separate thing altogether) that connects there would be easier and make more sense I think (although probably more expensive since you'd need to get two things instead of one, but hey at least it's optional if you don't care about it).

I would expect that if Krikzz already had a working FPGA YM-2413 he would have reused that code for the Everdrive N8's VRC7 already...<br /><br />Connecting the audio isn't a problem. There is a now-standard expansion port mod that a lot of PowerPak or Everdrive N8 users have already made for this purpose.
