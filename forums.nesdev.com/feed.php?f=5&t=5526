Look at the Sega Genesis/Megadrive for example, my friend had one when it came out and we'd rent games regularly.  It seemed like for a long time there weren't any 3rd party games at all.  Everything was by Sega, or EA (unlicensed).  Until Street Fighter 2 and Mortal Kombat, it seemed like there were virtually no identical games for both systems that I could notice.<br /><br />I bet Nintendo was quite fearful of the TG16/PCE, as it's so similar to the NES I bet that a lot of developers would've had a very easy time porting their stuff to it.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=10">Memblers</a> — Sat Sep 05, 2009 5:12 pm</p><hr />

This is one tactic I didn't like from nintendo (buying a lot of carts).  But now that the DS still "print money", I wouldn't be surprised that they're still using that tactic...<br /><br />Another fact was that you had to make your game exclusive for the nes.
