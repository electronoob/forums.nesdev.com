I don't think any SEI is needed exept between reset and the run of the code.

Disch, I'm too lazy to look for it right know, but recently you posted a MMC3 IRQ example where you mixed up 2 registers. That might be what he's talking about.<br /><br />EDIT: <a href="http://nesdev.com/bbs/viewtopic.php?p=30404#30404" class="postlink">Here it is</a>. You said $E000 enables IRQs and $E001 disables them, but it's the other way around. If he finished the setup with a $E000 write, there'd be no IRQ.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=95">tokumaru</a> — Sun Apr 06, 2008 6:17 pm</p><hr />

Well, adding something that just reset the IRQ counter in the NMI handler, remove the sprite zero hit waiting routine at all and make the IRQ handler points to modified sprite zero hit waiting routine is all you have to do to get it working. Then replace the sprite zero waiting per resister saving/restoring and IRQ acknownledging and you'll be fine.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=38">Bregalad</a> — Sun Apr 06, 2008 12:05 pm</p><hr />

You should use WRAM if you need more space for code. Just copy code there for a seperate bank at reset. Replace whatever code you have to write over though. Just an idea. I agree with Disch you should just write your own hack. You could use Loopy's as a reference but don't take it and try to copy paste it. <br /><br />And finally, when is all this flickering occuring? I'm guessing you made a hack that has a ton of enemys on screen at once?  That's the only thing I can think of since I never remember any status bar flicker on SMB but I recall hearing it could happen if you have alot of enemys on screen.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=1726">MottZilla</a> — Sun Apr 06, 2008 11:28 am</p><hr />
