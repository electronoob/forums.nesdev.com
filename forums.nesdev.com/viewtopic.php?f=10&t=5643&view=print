<br />
<br />I'm not really sure how it is with Computer Engineering, but I guess they'd focus more on the architecture of processors, which should mean looking into some assembly, but maybe they aren't as focused in programming logic.
<br />
<br />Whatever you choose, don't expect to learn how to program games in college. Every programming course nowadays (excluding those specific to games) will only focus on basic logic operations while the students are first learning how to program, and the advanced classes will be all about modern application crap: forms, databases, reports and that kind of shit. most programmers have no clue on how to make a real-time interactive program such as a game.

Once you have a basic understanding of loops, if/thens, structures etc. you will have an easier time reconstructing these actions on a more basic level.
<br />
<br />College teaches either beginner stuff you can find on Google, or the forms and database management of typical business apps.
<br />
<br />Video game schools teach things like collision detection and the advanced structures needed for complex games, but nowadays I would expect them to mostly be based around modern languages and 3D engines.
<br />
<br />For assembly, your best bet is forums like this one!

This teaches x86 assembly; so this would be a roundabout way of learning another processor like 6502. But, it is the background I came from and I can easily say that what I learned from that book made it very easy to learn 6502.

<br />Man watch your words no reason to be so rude.
<br />
<br />And I've actually had assembly courses in the contex of electronics course, but they really sucked real bad, it was damn easy for me and hard for others as the course sucked terribly. And video games aren't programmed in assembly any longer exept for really old machines when it's needed, so even if you are teached something about video games it won't be assembly, and vice-versa. Assembly is teached for embeded systems applications in electronics.
<br />
<br />And in my country currently nobody learns any actual programming in college unless you choose a special job-oriented college like I did.
<br />
<br />PS : I wonder what they do in those video game college in France, but I'm afraid it's some kind of trap for rich people to fall in, and learn nothing really usefor nor getting a proper diploma recognized internationally when they therminated the scool and passed the exams.

A lot of it applies to all kinds of games, from pong to the most advanced 3D game. However, once you learn those concepts in a high level environment you'll spend quite some time figuring out how to apply them on the old stuff using assembly.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">Bregalad wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">Man watch your words no reason to be so rude.</div><br />Say what? I just said that most programmers have no idea how to make games. Most can only do linear programming, where a limited number of tasks are performed in order as consequence to some kind of input, because this is all business programming really needs, so this is what they teach in regular programming courses.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">And I've actually had assembly courses in the contex of electronics course, but they really sucked real bad, it was damn easy for me and hard for others as the course sucked terribly.</div><br />Yeah, we worked a bit with some made up processor, but since I already knew 6502 it was all too damn easy. All other students hated those classes because they just didn't get a thing. Not a surprise at all, since most of them couldn't even program in Pascal!<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">I wonder what they do in those video game college in France, but I'm afraid it's some kind of trap for rich people to fall in, and learn nothing really usefor nor getting a proper diploma recognized internationally when they therminated the scool and passed the exams.</div>
<br />Here in Brazil the game programming market is kinda heating up, so there are in fact a number of courses (all very expensive) teaching that. I'm not sure it works, because the marketing appears to be oriented for players, who think it would be cool to make games but most don't have what it takes. So I guess the course makes them happy with some 3D modeling and basic scripting or something, and they get out of there thinking they can actually make a game.

<br />
<br />Basically, once you've learned enough from school, the rest lies in your hand and your own determination. No school will help you on that. So if your goal is just to do it as a hobby then you can learn it by yourself actually, a school is not necessary.

<br />Problem is that a lot of Bob Rost games are known to not work on hardware, so that's really not the best place to learn from.
