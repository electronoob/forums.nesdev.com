		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />There has been a little bit of talk, but I've wondered if anyone has actually used a XC9500XL series before with the NES.   Any issues noticed?
<br />
<br />I've been planning to stick to the XC9500 series, but the XL is often tempting.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I haven't used either, but AFAICT any device that is 5V-tolerant should be just fine without any kind of external protection.  Actually, later I'm planning on trying a device that isn't 5V tolerant, but will use series resistors to make it so (as described in one of Xilinx's app notes), so wish me luck on that, heheh.
<br />
<br />Timing-wise you need to be careful with the PRG bus (because of odd sprite-DMA issues and maybe other stuff), but the same thing applies when using 74-series chips or anything else as well.

<br />
<br />Could you describe a bit more in detail your last sentence?

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I don't know what's going on for sure, but what I've encountered while using an EPROM emulator was that sometimes just one or 2 sprites (I think always the same ones, too) would be corrupted.  What I believe is that the sprite DMA is changing the normal operation of the memory access cycle in a way that would only affect something fast (like 10ns response) such as a bus buffer.  Same thing as this other thread: <a href="http://nesdev.com/bbs/viewtopic.php?t=6212" class="postlink">http://nesdev.com/bbs/viewtopic.php?t=6212</a>
<br />
<br />So, I don't know the problem, or the fix, but the work-around is to use series resistors on the data bus.  The NES PowerPak seemed to have ran into a similar issue.  I don't think resistors don't fix the problem, but rather they prevent a bus conflict from becoming the problem.

<br />
<br />Do you mean the PRG data bus?  Why are pull-ups needed?  If it's 8 resistors or so to put on the board, that's not too bad (assuming the CPLD upgrade is worth it, I'm not familiar with the differences).
