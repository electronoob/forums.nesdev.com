		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I've read about "garbage reads" (sometimes specific to PPU stuff, other times specific to joypad stuff) over the years.  The terse explanation I've seen is that there's "crap on the bus" or something like that, which is why for certain things you supposedly discard the first read from some registers, etc...
<br />
<br />I'm pretty sure I remember seeing this sort of behaviour on the original Apple II+, but it was always thoroughly documented in whatever docs you were reading (usually official technical manuals from Apple, sometimes other people's source).
<br />
<br />I was hoping someone could take the time to explain to me what the deal is.  :-)
<br />
<br />P.S. -- No, I'm not getting back into NES development.  These are just things that I've read about time and time again, and was hoping someone could explain them.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />When the CPU reads from memory, it puts the request on the bus control lines, then reads whatever's on the data bus at the time. When reading from unmapped memory, the CPU gets whatever happens to be on the data bus at the time. Some devices don't output a full 8 bits, so the other bits likewise get whatever is on the bus at the time. The data lines on the bus tend to act like they have capacitors connected to them, so that they store whatever the last voltage was when they were being driven. The capacitance is very small, but MOS device inputs usually don't draw much power, so they don't drain it to zero volts that quickly. What happens is that the data bus tends to hold the last logic level it was driven with. When the CPU reads from an unmapped area or device that doesn't drive some lines, it gets the last byte that was read on the bus, which is usually that of the high byte of the address, since that's what the CPU had just read.
<br />
<br />I was recently reading about the ARM processor architecture, and apparently it internally uses this "charging the bus" to reduce transistor count. Apparently it "charges" the bus with logic 1 (positive voltage) during one clock, then something outputs a value on the next clock by either leaving the line charged (1) or draining it to zero volts (0). Just something related where this effect is used for a practical purpose.
<br />
<br />Hmmm, perhaps you are referring to having to do an <em>extra</em> read before you get useful data? Like with the PPU's read port at $2007, where it has a one-byte buffer. In that case, I'm assuming it's to give some flexibility as to when the actual read occurs. When you read from it, you immediately get what's in the buffer, then the PPU can refill it at its leisure. The data you get isn't garbage, just not what you'd expect if you thought there was no intermediate buffer. The DMC uses something similar.

<br />Examples of reading $2007 are given (not that I'd know why someone would really want to read from the PPU), but in another recent thread (can't find it right now) someone mentioned that you had to do this for joypad reads as well.  That said:

<br />How exactly does a programmer know when to do a dummy read, and on what registers?

You could also use CHR-RAM for some extra RAM if you can spare a few tiles and that RAM isn't accessed very frequently.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">someone mentioned that you had to do this for joypad reads as well.</div><br />I believe that the issue with joypad reads is that while DPCM samples are playing, the NES fetching DPCM data could trigger some ghost reads of the joypad data, corrupting a full joypad read made by the program.

<br />I think this has to be tested and documented. We know for a fact that $2007 reads are delayed because of tests made on actual hardware.

<br />The controllers don't need dummy reads. But DPCM can double-clock $2007 reads just like it can double-clock $4016-$4017 reads, causing the program to skip a byte when it reads VRAM. That's one reason why I chose <em>not</em> to store a side-scroller's environment destruction log in an otherwise unused part of sprite VRAM.

<br />I bet not many, since the double-clock issue was probably known at the time, as some games appear to be aware of it when reading the controllers.

<br />Tecmo Super Bowl reads from the PPU when you select certain menus that have a dropdown box. It was only really necessay on a few dynamic screens, but they chose to use it for some static screens as well. Probably to avoid having to redraw the entire screen?
