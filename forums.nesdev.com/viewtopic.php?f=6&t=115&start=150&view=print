<br />
<br />The title theme consists of these 2 codes:
<br />9BB5 2F
<br />9BBD 42
<br />
<br />Using the second screen's music as the title screen requires these 2 codes:
<br />9BB5 37
<br />9BBD FF
<br />
<br />Using the third screen's music as the title screen requires these 2 codes:
<br />9BB5 33
<br />9BBD FF
<br />
<br />It'll mostly be a disassembly search, looking for LDAs, followed by sequential JSRs to E331, and E33C. You seem to have some music code written, since you know about differences between pieces of music. I guess I can leave this up to you, now that the song loading pattern has been identified. A quick disassembling, and a search for calls should lead you to sounds/music you can test using the title screen.
<br />
<br />I can't even handle the Bases Loaded 4 rip yet, so it seems like a shot in the dark to try and finish this thing in the hour I intend to stay up from now...and it would be duplicated effort to find and debug the rest of the inits(821F is a Sound Init)

<br />Heck in the age of 500 MB PSF2 rips (<em>Katamari Damacy</em> and anything else that uses streaming), I wouldn't mind if the NSF is as big as the .nes file's PRG. You can just 00 out stuff that it doesn't use, and it'll compress away to nothing anyway, praise Phil Katz.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />It took a while, but I ripped 'Kid Klown'. I also have the idea of using the Memory Viewer, and pasting everything before the music area of memory from active game memory to the NSF memory(by using the Memory Viewer opening trick), at some point after any memory clearing is done. This would have made it a bit easier to rip Kid Klown, had I figured it out before...because all it was really missing was a default jump location.

As you said you were having trouble with the title screen, but I was easily able to record an mp3 of it from the original easily, just to complete the soundtrack. You did great work overall though, lots of songs I didn't even know were in the game!

<br />
<br />Namco Classic 2's 8K music bank is split into two portions - one is a pointer table used to init, the other is the music data. For the pointer table, the bank is placed at $8000-$9FFF, and for the music, it's placed at $A000-$BFFF. The game also does a bunch of writes to $4012, but DMC is never turned on.
