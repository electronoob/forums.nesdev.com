I finally figured out it was my TV's fault by using my Wii U and comparing the screen on the Gamepad to the TV. I had never noticed it before because there's nothing essential that far on the sides of the screen.<br /><br />I thought I'd go on Emerson's website and download new firmware for it, but it just displays &quot;page not found.&quot;  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_lol.gif" alt=":lol:" title="Laughing" /> <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.emersonaudiovideo.com/support/download.php">http://www.emersonaudiovideo.com/support/download.php</a><!-- m -->

Really no excuse for it, not even &quot;but we started with CRT HDTVs and people will whine if the image doesn't go to the corners&quot;â€”1- CRT manufacturing was good enough at that point that you really could display the entire picture without obvious underscanning, and 2-even if it <em>did</em> there's still no reason an LCD HDTV should assume there's no valid signal in the corners anyway; the overscanned region has to be encoded into the MPEG2 stream over-the-air anyway.

What's really bizarre, is that putting it in 4:3 still cuts off the left and right sides of the screen...<br /><br />And I've got go say, who even had an HD CRT in the first place? I have yet to see one in person.
