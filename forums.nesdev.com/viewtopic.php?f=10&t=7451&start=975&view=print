How are you calculating the sprite coordinate then? You can't simply take oX and use that for the sprites, unchanged.<br /><br />You have to keep in mind that when you're dealing with scrolling games, you have 2 coordinate systems to care about&#058; level coordinates and screen coordinates. Level coordinates are absolute, they indicate where in the level the objects are, and this doesn't change, no matter where the camera is. Screen coordinates, however, are relative to the camera, so before displaying objects on the screen you have to convert level coordinates into screen coordinates. Since the left edge of the camera represents the left edge of the screen, you have to subtract the camera's coordinate from the coordinate you're converting: <strong>SpriteX = oX - CameraX</strong>.<br /><br />You may take shortcuts, but generally speaking, you have to convert between coordinate systems for everything you'll display on the screen, since the relative position of everything changes as the camera moves. For example, if you want to render a metatile column at the right side of the screen, you have to convert the column number from screen coordinates into level coordinates so that you know which column to read from the level map. You may have taken shortcuts here, but conceptually, this is what's happening (or should be!).

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Yes, but I can't think of many cases where that would be necessary. Things often happen in the level, and you need to translate that to the screen so that the player can see what's happening, but the opposite should be very rare. In a device with a touch screen you'd do that to check what parts of the level are being touched, but this is obviously not the case of the NES. Would you mind telling us why you need this conversion?

Both work, I just happen to find one method more appropriate than the other.

So in one screen it draws every other 32 bit wide column twice.  And also it starts in the wrong nametable... it should take a break at the beginning while our girl travels across nametable 0 and nametable 1... now it starts drawing the columns on nametable 1.

(Because cameraposition = ladyposition - 128) Except the cameraposition is the leftmost point of a 256 pixel box. 128+256 = 384. You're showing 128 past the right edge of the level.<br /><br />So if cameraposition is greater than levellength - 256, you set it to levellength - 256.<br /><br />This works for any value of levellength that is equal to or greater than 256 pixels.

The camera shouldn't be negative. <br /><br />As for how, just subtract the numbers and check for a clear carry which tells you you went below zero. If that happens set camera position to zero. It makes no difference if you're using 8bit, 16bit or 24bit numbers. (But if you want to actually scroll, you want a range greater than 8 bits will provide)<br /><br />Think in unsigned bytes for this.</div>Brilliant!  Thank you Kasumi! <img src="./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" />  <span style="color: #808080">...I remember that cmp would work because it acts just like subtraction only it discards the answer... and that would be fine... the carry would still be cleared.</span><br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">Kasumi wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"><br />Edit:<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"> Right now there is one thing I notice that's wrong... cameraposition can be greater than 127 because the levellength+1 is = to 4. So would that mean that the negative value would span two bytes</div><br />Huh?</div>levellength+1 is 4... so cameraposition would have to be big enough to reach 768... my logic doesn't work well right now.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">Kasumi wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"> Let's say your level is 256 pixels long. Your lady is at 256. This puts the camera at 128. (Because cameraposition = ladyposition - 128) Except the cameraposition is the leftmost point of a 256 pixel box. 128+256 = 384. You're showing 128 past the right edge of the level.<br /><br />So if cameraposition is greater than levellength - 256, you set it to levellength - 256.<br /><br />This works for any value of levellength that is equal to or greater than 256 pixels.</div>Thank you so much for stepping through both of your ideas! <img src="./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /><br /><br /><span style="color: #808080">edit.</span>
