Lack of citing everywhere, and all too often it's an obviously summarized, truncated, and freely interpreted/winged translation/mistranslation of the english version.<br /><br />Then again, a traditional dictionary is completely oblique. Is an article drawn from research? a single source? how much of the authors' interpretation has bled into the description without telling so?

Is it really that complicated to use proper structured sentences when writing something down ?

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I'm not entirely sure it's just to sound young and cool. In anthropology, the term &quot;creolization&quot; has been extended to work as an analogy for the mixing of languages and cultures when meeting on a new platform. Just replace &quot;the new world&quot; with &quot;world wide web&quot;, on which english is the dominant language as far as people from different nations talking to each other is concerned.<br /><br />In teenage and early 20s years, i heard the phrase &quot;men obv&quot; which is a sweded version of &quot;well, obv&quot;, which in turn of course is a chat abbreviation for &quot;well, obviously&quot;. Overusage of this phrase is perhaps something you'd tie to youthful edgyness, so it's not the best example, but my point is that we're seeing a creolization of sorts where chat speak, english, and native languages are cross-pollinating. The effect should be most recognizeable in other languages since english is the main mode of communication.<br /><br />It's not wrong in itself, it's just informal. Though ever so often, use of informal language often leak into formal use, eventually. In the early 90's, the swedish state made a fruitless effort to standardize the term &quot;elpost&quot; (meaning electric post) and insist state employees use the word, which sits better in swedish, but as it turned out, people preferred saying and writing anything but this specific variation. E-mail, emejl, mejl, epost, e-post. Throughout the 90s, you could also see people writing/saying ebrev (e-letter), but i think that use has ceased completely. These have since long been so integrated in everyday use that &quot;elpost&quot; sounds outright wrong and confusing.

I don't know whether other users experience this, but when I write &quot;proper structured sentences&quot;, I often don't fill in a paragraph from start to finish. Instead, I type phrases as they come to me, moving the insertion point to where in the sentence they belong with Ctrl+Left and Ctrl+Right on a computer's keyboard and occasionally rearranging them using Shift+Ctrl+Left to select text, Ctrl+X, move insertion point, Ctrl+V. When rearranging a sentence requires changing a word's inflection (such as <em>copy</em> vs. <em>copies</em>) or derivation (such as <em>revise</em> vs. <em>revision</em>), Ctrl+Left and Ctrl+Right make moving the insertion point to the end of a word fairly consistent. But touch-driven mobile devices make it a chore to move the insertion point, particularly to the start or end of a word because the space character's glyph is so narrow. This makes going back and editing what I've written less practical. Other users may adapt by typing in the same stream-of-consciousness mode in which they talk or even using the operating system's speech-to-text input method.

How they manage to keep the pace or how that could be better than pen and paper, i don't know. You'd need to write your papers on a regular computer later. <br /><br />iOS could easily have had letter/word left/right jump keys in the white field right above the keyboard, but it doesn't. Such a miss, IMO.
