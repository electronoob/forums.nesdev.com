		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Hi all,<br /><br />I am working on the Sachen game Beast Fighter and I notice the status bar at the bottom of the screen doesn't show up.<br /><br /><a href="https://imgbb.com/" class="postlink"><img src="https://image.ibb.co/kjD03R/bf_screen.png" alt="Image" /></a> &lt;-- Normal Frame<br /><a href="https://imgbb.com/" class="postlink"><img src="https://image.ibb.co/hApexm/bf_window.png" alt="Image" /></a> &lt;-- The one loading frame where we can see the status bar.<br /><br />The window is set to 0,0. <br /><br />On the one frame where the rest of the screen if off during loading, you can see that the status bar shows up correctly. In this case the game turns the window on at line 0 and just runs to the end.<br /><br />But, on normal frames after loading, it does this:<br /><br />- LY = LYC interrupt at sacnline 114<br />- turn on the window<br />- turn off the window again at vblank.<br /><br />My understanding is that when you first turn the window on it always begins at the location specified by the window coordinates, regardless of the current LY value. So is the correct behaviour to not draw the status bar as above? Some videos online never the less show the status bar, what is the correct behaviour here?<br /><br />Thanks for any insight, it's either one way or the other but I don't know which is correct.

(What I'm calling the line counter selects which line from the map is drawn for that LCD line.) However, if you set the window bit to 0, you can pause the rendering of the window.

If it does so at some point after line 0 has started (perhaps still in the VBlank interrupt handler) window rendering mode could be entered and that could be used to resume it later on in the frame. <br /><br />So my follow-up question would be, could you log any writes to LCDC, WY and perhaps also WX and note at which line they each happen?

Though it's set to 0, it can still render. Even though Nintendo explicitly said values under 7 shouldn't be used, values of 0-6 apparently act as 0 anyway. For future reference (if you start emulating GBC stuff) Star Wars Episode I - Racer does uses this behavior briefly when drawing your pod in the garage. It puzzled me for a long time because I thought if window offsets were out of range (7 supposedly being the minimum x value) it wouldn't draw, but that's not the case.<br /><br />It sounds like Beast Fighter ought to be changing WY during the LYC interrupt, similar to how Mega Man I - V handle their status bars via the window. They trigger an LYC interrupt on some line (128?) but the relevant window tiles are at the bottom portion, so WY is adjusted accordingly.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Fwiw, I'm just assuming values of 1-6 of WX get translated to 0. I never got around to making a test ROM myself. I believe that garbage data is supposed to be drawn to the screen, but the window in SW EP1 - Racer is all black, so even when it ends up pulling &quot;random&quot; values, the BG/WIN data in VRAM is all the same, making it moot. I've had the game since I was a kid, so I can verify that it looks fine on real hardware. It's the only commercial game I know that does this with WX, and now that you mention it, looks like the devs came up with a workaround.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Thanks for the help so far.<br /><br />I do still draw the window when WindowX is 0, so that part at least is not the issue. Actually the game never writes to WindowX or WindowY anyway.<br /><br />(The LY=LYC interrupt happens on 104 not 114 like I wrote in the OP, my mistake.)<br />Here are all the writes to the PPU regs that happen in a frame:<br /><br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">SL, Reg, (ID), value written<br />144 FF43 (SCX) 0x00<br />144 FF42 (SCY) 0x00<br />144 FF46 (DMA) 0xC0<br />146 FF40 (LCDC) 0xD3<br />104 FF40 (LCDC) 0xEB <br />104 FF42 (SCY) 0x00<br />104 FF43 (SCX) 0x00 </div><br /><br />So, it definitely turns off the window in vblank and doesn't turn it back on until LY=LYC interrupt. Maybe the writes to SCY and SCX at the interrupt are supposed to be writes to the window instead of scroll, but the whole interrupt routing is just this:<br /><br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">====IRQ==== <br />0048:&nbsp; F3&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; DI&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A:00 F:70 B:00 C:10 D:C0 E:A0 H:CF L:10 SP:C1FD Cy:91196112 LY:104 zNHCie<br />0049:&nbsp; CD AE 02&nbsp; CALL #02AEh&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;A:00 F:70 B:00 C:10 D:C0 E:A0 H:CF L:10 SP:C1FD Cy:91196116 LY:104 zNHCie<br />02AE:&nbsp; F5&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; PUSH AF&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;A:00 F:70 B:00 C:10 D:C0 E:A0 H:CF L:10 SP:C1FB Cy:91196140 LY:104 zNHCie<br />02AF:&nbsp; C5&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; PUSH BC&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;A:00 F:70 B:00 C:10 D:C0 E:A0 H:CF L:10 SP:C1F9 Cy:91196156 LY:104 zNHCie<br />02B0:&nbsp; D5&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; PUSH DE&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;A:00 F:70 B:00 C:10 D:C0 E:A0 H:CF L:10 SP:C1F7 Cy:91196172 LY:104 zNHCie<br />02B1:&nbsp; E5&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; PUSH HL&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;A:00 F:70 B:00 C:10 D:C0 E:A0 H:CF L:10 SP:C1F5 Cy:91196188 LY:104 zNHCie<br />02B2:&nbsp; 3E EB&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;LD&nbsp; &nbsp;A,#EBh&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;A:00 F:70 B:00 C:10 D:C0 E:A0 H:CF L:10 SP:C1F3 Cy:91196204 LY:104 zNHCie<br />02B4:&nbsp; E0 40&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;LDH&nbsp; (#FF40h),A&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;A:EB F:70 B:00 C:10 D:C0 E:A0 H:CF L:10 SP:C1F3 Cy:91196212 LY:104 zNHCie<br />02B6:&nbsp; FA 03 C2&nbsp; LD&nbsp; &nbsp;A,(#C203h)&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;A:EB F:70 B:00 C:10 D:C0 E:A0 H:CF L:10 SP:C1F3 Cy:91196224 LY:104 zNHCie<br />02B9:&nbsp; E0 42&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;LDH&nbsp; (#FF42h),A&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;A:00 F:70 B:00 C:10 D:C0 E:A0 H:CF L:10 SP:C1F3 Cy:91196240 LY:104 zNHCie<br />02BB:&nbsp; 3E 00&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;LD&nbsp; &nbsp;A,#00h&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;A:00 F:70 B:00 C:10 D:C0 E:A0 H:CF L:10 SP:C1F3 Cy:91196252 LY:104 zNHCie<br />02BD:&nbsp; E0 43&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;LDH&nbsp; (#FF43h),A&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;A:00 F:70 B:00 C:10 D:C0 E:A0 H:CF L:10 SP:C1F3 Cy:91196260 LY:104 zNHCie<br />02BF:&nbsp; E1&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; POP&nbsp; HL&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;A:00 F:70 B:00 C:10 D:C0 E:A0 H:CF L:10 SP:C1F3 Cy:91196272 LY:104 zNHCie<br />02C0:&nbsp; D1&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; POP&nbsp; DE&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;A:00 F:70 B:00 C:10 D:C0 E:A0 H:CF L:10 SP:C1F5 Cy:91196284 LY:104 zNHCie<br />02C1:&nbsp; C1&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; POP&nbsp; BC&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;A:00 F:70 B:00 C:10 D:C0 E:A0 H:CF L:10 SP:C1F7 Cy:91196296 LY:104 zNHCie<br />02C2:&nbsp; F1&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; POP&nbsp; AF&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;A:00 F:70 B:00 C:10 D:C0 E:A0 H:CF L:10 SP:C1F9 Cy:91196308 LY:104 zNHCie<br />02C3:&nbsp; C9&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; RET&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;A:00 F:70 B:00 C:10 D:C0 E:A0 H:CF L:10 SP:C1FB Cy:91196320 LY:104 zNHCie<br />004C:&nbsp; FB&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; EI&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A:00 F:70 B:00 C:10 D:C0 E:A0 H:CF L:10 SP:C1FD Cy:91196336 LY:104 zNHCie<br />004D:&nbsp; D9&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; RETI&nbsp; &nbsp;</div><br /><br />So yeah, seems like it shouldn't really be drawn. Any ideas?<br /><br />EDIT: Also, If i don't draw the window at all the status bar displays just fine since it's also available in the BG. So, maybe it's really not drawing the window somehow afterall?<br /><br />EDIT2: Does CGB boot up with WX and WY as 0xFF instead of 0x00? GB seems to boot to (0,0) according to Gekkio's tests, meaning the window would hide the status bar, but if CGB boots to (0xFF,0xFF) it would be really disabled and the the BG version of it would show through. Plausible?

So alternatively it might be easier to make a test rom that tries to display a window without writing to window x,y and see if it behaves differently on GB and CGB.<br /><br />Either way I'll be interested to see what the results are.
