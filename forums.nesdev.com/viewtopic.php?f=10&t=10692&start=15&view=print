Although, I was under the impression that the header covered most of that.<br /><br />In any case, I'm just trying to get things set up for myself to a point where I can begin learning coding for the NES, and it's proving a lot more complicated than I had expected. I managed to find a syntax highlighting file for Geany easily enough and I figured from there I could just set up the commands to run the compiler, linker if necessary, and have the &quot;run&quot; option launch FCEUX. However it appears it's not quite that simple. There are many different compilers, none of which are overwhelmingly considered the &quot;industry standard&quot; (please correct me if I'm wrong about that, but that's the impression I get) and it seems that code written for one compiler isn't trivially compiled by the others. CA65 is the only one I was able to get working on my computer (also tried ASM6, NESASM, and WLA but couldn't get any of them to work), and it too is proving to be much more complicated than I thought to get set up. If each source file needs (or could need) its own special configuration options, I can't just download someone's source and try it out, they need to have posted their config file or I need to otherwise figure out the necessary settings somehow.<br /><br />Anyway is there some kind of standard config file that you guys would reccommend I use for getting started?

I guess the copy of the code I had before was borked or something. Anyway ASM6 now works like a charm and I don't appear to have to worry about linking or fooling around with config files or anything like that. It was quite straightforward to just plug in the compile command for Geany and let 'er rip. I tested it on a file that was written for it and it worked perfectly the first time. So now that I'm set up I think I can get to work on the actual guts of trying to code my first NES rom(s).<br /><br />Thanks again for everyone's help and patience with a newbie like me ^_^;

NESASM uses [] instead () for some of the funnier memory modes. Still others allow for automatic translation of text data into a different character set (e.g. places where &quot;A&quot; isn't represented by the number 65). I've never found one where it wasn't obvious to me what they're trying to do, although I can't say I know what the full set of equivalent commands are.

Then everything goes off the deep end.
