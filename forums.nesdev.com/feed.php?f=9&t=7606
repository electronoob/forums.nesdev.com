What a coincidence, I'm building an MMC1 dev cart next week <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /> I'll have a crack at this.<br /><br />In my opinion these clones are the future of the NES scene. Like it or not, the number of functioning NES units gets smaller and smaller every day. These clones are a new breath of life for an aging hardware platform. And with so many out in the wild now, I feel like I pretty much have to support them.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3706">qbradq</a> — Sat Apr 02, 2011 10:54 am</p><hr />

Supporting incorrect clones is up to the individual author. Really no one should bother supporting it unless their target market is one that the NES or Famicom was not officially released in. Even still, the hope would be that someone would fully clone the NES <strong>correctly</strong> instead.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=1726">MottZilla</a> — Fri Apr 01, 2011 9:06 pm</p><hr />

Clones got these ratios inverted: when the waves are supposed to stay up 75% of the time and down 25% of the time, they do the opposite, 25% up and 75% down. Something like that.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=95">tokumaru</a> — Fri Apr 01, 2011 7:09 pm</p><hr />

I'm not aware of any possible way of fixing it since the Clone chip is already made with the error. Now provided you could reprogram a cartridge you could swap the duty cycles in the software so that it sounds right on the messed up clone and wrong on the authentic hardware. <br /><br />In theory homebrew could have an option to allow for swapping duty cycles so if played on a clone system it would still sound correct if the user enabled the swap. <br /><br />The best solution is to just use authentic hardware. Leave the cheap clones to people that don't know better.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=1726">MottZilla</a> — Fri Apr 01, 2011 2:57 pm</p><hr />

I have noticed that my Yobo FamilClone (part number OT-8008). I have noticed that on some games the music goes a little askew every now and then. For instance, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. But two days ago I picked up a copy of Crystalis from a local reseller, and it sounds like absolute dirt. About every other note is *very* flat, turning the music I once loved into non-stop pain.<br /><br />Does anyone know what causes this? I've read in an old post that there are "duty cycle problems", and something about the duty cycles on the square waves being "swapped", but nothing too specific.<br /><br />And is there any way I can make my homebrew games sound decent on both the original hardware and these clone systems?<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3706">qbradq</a> — Fri Apr 01, 2011 1:23 pm</p><hr />
