		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I have noticed that several Game Boy games contain a 32-byte footer at the end of one or more 16KB banks. For example, in &quot;Kirby's Pinball Land (USA, Europe)&quot; and &quot;Kirby no Pinball (Japan)&quot;:<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">07fe0: .. C6 01 .. 05 00 .. C1 80 .. C3 F3 .. 8A E8 .. 08 98 .. 11 10 .. 62 00<br />0ffe0: .. 0F 01 .. 8D 00 .. C5 13 .. 86 C0 .. 90 AD .. 23 81 .. 98 F3 .. 20 00<br />23fe0: .. 6E BF .. 7F DF .. FF BE .. F7 CF .. 07 DB .. 2C ED .. FF F8 .. BB 00<br />2bfe0: .. 66 F7 .. 5F DF .. 7F F7 .. AD DE .. EB 3D .. F3 23 .. 7F 7D .. 3F 00<br />2ffe0: .. 08 40 .. 40 A4 .. 15 49 .. 15 36 .. 50 8F .. 6B 0C .. F0 4D .. 10 00<br />3ffe0: .. 98 85 .. 21 09 .. 41 33 .. 83 48 .. F8 51 .. 33 22 .. 90 74 .. 14 00<br /></div>(.. represents a pair of &quot;blank&quot; bytes - either $00 $00 or $ff $ff)<br /><br /><br />Very similar footers exist in &quot;Kirby's Dream Land&quot;, and footers in the same format exist in other games, including:<br /><br /><ul><li>Adventures of Star Saver, The (USA, Europe)</li><li>Alien vs Predator - The Last of His Clan (USA)</li><li>Bonk's Adventure (USA)</li><li>Desert Strike - Return to the Gulf (USA)</li><li>Jetsons, The - Robot Panic (USA, Europe)</li><li>Jurassic Park (USA)</li><li>Mysterium (USA)</li><li>Pac-Attack (USA)</li><li>Snow Bros. Jr. (USA)</li><li>Spud's Adventure (USA)</li><li>Top Gun - Guts &amp; Glory (USA, Europe)</li></ul><br />Another thing these games have in common is that they all seem to use the same pattern to fill blank space - 32 bytes of $00 alternating with 32 bytes of $ff. In some cases this filler contains a significant number of flipped bits.<br /><br /><br />Does anyone know whether these 32-byte footers have any meaning? The values do not seem to be dependent on the contents of the 16KB bank - note that the two releases of &quot;Kirby's Pinball Land&quot; contain exactly the same footers, even for banks which differ.<br /><br />Have bank footers similar to these been seen anywhere else? What might be their purpose?

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Could be code, perhaps part of a library or some other commonly used codebase. One way to verify this, use a debugger and set breakpoints for that memory region. I'd chose a game with fewer banks to watch and see if any of them execute in the footers. Understanding what it does requires disassembling it though.<br /><br />Actually, quicker way to see if it's code is to just set a breakpoint at $38. If the &quot;..&quot; in the footers happen to be $FF, that will jump to $38 in memory (it's the RST 38 instruction). You could use a trace function in a debugger to see if it ever returns to one of the footers.

At least for the Kirby games, the footers are not accessed at run-time.<br /><br /><br />As mentioned, the footer at $07fe0 in both versions of &quot;Kirby's Pinball Land&quot; is also present, unchanged, in one version of &quot;Kirby's Dream Land&quot;. Very similar footers exist in other versions of the latter game.<br /><br />Interestingly, the exact data from &quot;Kirby's Pinball Land&quot; is also present in one version of &quot;Shanghai&quot;, but the other two versions of &quot;Shanghai&quot; contain no footers at all. The only version of &quot;Shanghai&quot; which contains a footer is also the only one to use the alternating $00 $ff pattern to fill blank space.<br /><br />Thus, I think it is likely that the footers come from the blank space (into which they are embedded) rather than from the useful data. Perhaps the build tools used for the games output a format such as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel_HEX" class="postlink">Intel HEX</a>, which can contain &quot;holes&quot;. The footers may then have been inserted by the tool/method used to convert the output into a plain binary, filling in the blank space.<br /><br />Whatever method was used to fill the blank space, it seems to have been imperfect - the pattern of $00 $ff contains several &quot;wrong&quot; bits. Perhaps another imperfection led to the presence of the footers.<br /><br /><br />I have also found similar footers in a few NES games, including &quot;Empereur, L' (USA)&quot;, &quot;Mega Man 6 (USA)&quot;/&quot;Rockman 6 (Japan)&quot; and &quot;Romance of the Three Kingdoms II (USA)&quot;. Again these use the alternating format for unused data - perhaps the same HEX =&gt; binary method was used for these games as well?

Because it's possible they were overwriting the same memory chip. Alternatively, it could be a leftover from a development tool (it wasn't uncommon for data that remained in RAM in the development PC to end up in unused areas of the ROM).
