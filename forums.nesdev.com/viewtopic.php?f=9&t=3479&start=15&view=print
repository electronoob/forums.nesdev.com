<br />
<br />Not really, for several reasons. First of all, it's not designed for good readability - it has sparse comments and it's difficult to follow the logic because of all the poorly named variables and structures. (This is a serious flaw, in my opinion. MAME is supposed to be a documentation project, after all.) Secondly, much of it is probably inaccurate guesswork. Right off the bat I see some tables full of raw decibel values, as well as some fixed-point stuff. Does this actually reflect how the chips worked on a DIGITAL level? Maybe, but it smells like guesswork to me. Some information in the YM2413 core is listed as verified on the actual hardware (or rather an OPL2, which is a superset of it) but not all of it is confirmed. And I know for a fact that some of the other FM stuff in MAME is inaccurate; Genesis fans have been complaining for a long time about the poor state of YM2612 emulation.
<br />
<br />A lot of the basic stuff about the YM2413/VRCVII is still unclear to me. I know they use phase accumulators for each operator and that the upper portion of these are used as an offset into a sine wave table. Apparently, one of the F-numbers is modified by the output of the other wave (therefore providing "FM" or phase modulation) but it is not clear to me how this is done. On what scale (numerically) is the sine output? How is the output of the modulator wave converted into a delta for the carrier wave's F-value? I don't have a clue and none of the source I have read is particularly enlightening on this front. That's not even beginning to get into the more complicated stuff like how "feedback" or "vibrato" affects oscillator values.
