		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />My first NES Homebrew game is now complete. Basically, it is a remake of the popular mobile game &quot;2048&quot; but enhanced with the music of Blurred Lines. It is a shot-for-shot recreation of the music video complete with dancing half-naked ladies and music that is very accurate to the original song. I will be creating a YouTube video the compares the game's video to the actual music video so people can see the shot-for-shot intricacy of everything built.<br /><br />The game is meant to be a novelty - people will probably play it through once and then show a friend. I started this game last year and have been working on it off and on since then.<br /><br />Let me know what you think! Yes I understand many people hate this song. I used to like it somewhat but after having to hear it 1000 times to study it, I don't want to hear it anymore.

Well put together, and pleasant sound.<br /><br />The only thing I'd suggest is that the music should just loop instead of stopping and restarting, kinda killed the moment for me when it just stopped in the middle of a game. (I guess this is a bit of a conflict between being background music for a game, and an accurate representation of the music video?)

It's random with a very uneven distribution, but unpredictable nonetheless. Any given bit could be 1 or 0 on power-on.<br /><br />What NDX does is evenly distributed, I think, so it's not a good statistical model, but it is sufficient to demonstrate what could happen on a real NES.

The purpose of the randomization is to make it easy to notice if your (or somebody else's) program relies on uninitialized memory, which is almost always a bad idea. Most emulators paint a too optimistic picture (from homebrewer's point of view) by zeroing out memory and initializing mappers into an NROM compatible state.<br /><br />(I'm not randomizing mapper register state just yet, but I've planned to add an option for that as well.)<br /><br />EDIT: And by &quot;nope&quot; I meant: no, it doesn't happen exactly like that on real NES, but the implications for the program you are developing are the same.

Problem I found was that no matter how hard I tried, I couldn't see to get the samples to reach the full 4095 byte size. I think each ended up being 4082. This made it so when I played them back to back, there was a brief pause between them. Not sure how to get that correct. After I produced them in Audacity, I used FamiTracker next and that created the ultimate files that I used.<br /><br />The next thing I need to accomplish is to transfer the game to a cartridge I bought (TKROM 512) that can be flashed. Problem is that the program I used asked me to separate the file so that the PRG file is separate. I have a .chr file, and I have the file that I program with that is compiled using NESASM but I don't know how to save just the PRG to a separate file.

(255 * 16 + 1)<br /><br />See: <a href="http://wiki.nesdev.com/w/index.php/APU_DMC" class="postlink">http://wiki.nesdev.com/w/index.php/APU_DMC</a><br />It's an 8-bit length value (max 255), shifted by 4 bits (x16), and the DPCM unit always reads one extra sample (a mistake in the implementation, IMO).
