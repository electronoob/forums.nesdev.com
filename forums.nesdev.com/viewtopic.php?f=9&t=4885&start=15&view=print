Make one that is more costly/more chips but it FME7 100% clone, and another that is FME7 compatible to a point and cheaper/less chips? It would be nice to have the designs both available so anyone could just put together their own FME7 mapper for their purposes, whether they want a 100% compatible or less.
<br />
<br />I'm guessing that you would be making the PRG registers for each section the same as the $6000 section where they are 6bits in size and the upper 2 bits are used for selecting ROM enable or RAM enable? 
<br />
<br />I do look forward to seeing what you come up with and hope that I can look at it and try to understand "why" it works and how it works.

<br />
<br />Use the XC95144XL (~$6).  It has 5V tolerant inputs, and you can do an easy tristate/pullup to get 5V outputs.  I am sure it will work because a board coming out very soon uses it  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />  If you use some external registers like the HC670 then the XC9572XL gets down to ~$2.

<br />A through hole discrete logic board still may be a good idea because the CPLDs aren't really hand solderable except for the plcc 44s.

<br />
<br />I do think designing the discrete version would be a good project still. But then again I really want to be able to make FME-7s so I'd say that anyway. Ofcourse if you have pre-made boards with CPLDs for sale I guess that's ok too. But the discrete version seems more useful since anyone could build it and there is no mystery behind it then.

<br />
<br />Currently it uses:
<br />
<br />2.5x 74 (two can be switched to 161 which are cheaper, 0.5 can be dropped if one screen mirroring isn't needed)
<br />4x 191
<br />2x 139
<br />1x 161
<br />6x 670
<br />2x 00 (just for mirroring... one can be dropped if one screen isn't needed)
<br />6x pullups (for fixed bank... yeah.. but that is what the pirate does too)
<br />
<br />I'm guessing it will take 3 more chips at most bringing the total to approx. 20.

It would be nice to be able to map ROM or WRAM there like the FME-7 original. 20 chips isn't too bad I guess. =) I wonder what all the components will cost for building a cart. Not that it really matters as anything beats butchering the supply of Batman RotJ cartridges.

<br />
<br />The PRG mapping is kinda a big issue; internally the FME-7 probably isn't arranged as a register file so it's hard to fit it into one. By building a custom mapper, all this stuff can be taken care of so easily ;) Every time I build something of 74 series chips I'm astonished how poor the selection is...
<br />
<br />Something ghetto I've thought of is using a 8K ROM as a poor man's PAL to take care of the random logic ;) I think it's fast enough though this is really not a good idea heh

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Just curious, does the FME-7 style of mapper require more logic than the VRC4? I wonder about that because it affects the way you write and the size of your mapper functions when you have to select a register and write it through that two address system where as with the VRC4 it's a good bit faster, except for the 4bit CHR registers. Mainly curious as other than MMC5, FME-7 and VRC4 are the most "powerful" mappers. I haven't ever seen inside a pirate konami VRC game cartridge but I wonder if they already did the work of creating a discrete version of the VRC4 similar to how a FME7ish discrete was made in that other pirate cart linked to here somewhere.
