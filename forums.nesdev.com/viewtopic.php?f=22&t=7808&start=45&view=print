		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />ccovell, it was very helpful. You mentioned the two issues that are bothering me the most.
<br />
<br />I may be able to improve the graphics, but I'm not sure how to combat "dead space", as somebody put it. Ideally, I'm hoping that more different types of enemies will make the problem solve itself eventually, but with the amount of backtracking you may be tempted to do in the full game, this...
<br /><div class="quotetitle">Gilbert wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">I'm exceptionally impressed by how well the game memorises defeated enemies (so those damn bats won't respawn immediately like Rockman hell) and destroyed blocks.</div>
<br />is actually going to pose a problem.
<br />Other games never feel empty <strong>because</strong> of the respawn. There is always something looking to kill you, I like to call that the "Arcade Spirit".
<br />
<br />Again, thanks for everyone's feedback! Very inspiring. :)

<br />Or make them respawn on locations where you can use enemies to advance.

<br />NO !!! DON'T FIX THIS. Good NES games MUST use incorrect english !!
<br />
<br />Other than that, no I didn't watch the video. But if I should watch it to play this is the equivalent to vatch a video on youtube to beat a part of a game you can't beat (I do that quite often in fact) and this normally shouldn't be needed, at least not in level 1. Don't take it wrong, the game is great, it's just that a walkthrough shouldn't be needed to beat level 1.
<br />
<br />OK I know some NES games (Castlevania II, Zelda I/II, Metroid etc...) which are impossible without using a walkthrough.
<br />
<br />EDIT : It's the trick at 4:21 that I couldn't find on my own. Oh well...

<br />
<br />I knew what it was doing but I didn't know at first how to enter that "mode". After some practice I figured it out.
<br />
<br />As for the secret level, I'm almost done but that level of hard kill the fun. It should only be as an extra for people that want to test their skills. If something similar ends up as a normal level, you will lose your audience.
<br />
<br />Even thought the enemies were sparse I didn't mind much at first about that detail. The game is so fluid that I didn't focus on that since I was having fun playing it.  If there is a way to put more then yes, that would make it less empty.

<br />
<br />I finished the extra level (no cheating but with savestates, of course) and even found the 3rd-stage lady hanging around there.  That level was quite the mind &amp; reflex-twister, so good job!  I also liked the various messages that you get from exploring the levels and newly-reachable areas on the second time through. 
<br />
<br />I did spot two block-elimination bugs while playing... One when I destroyed a bat and he flew towards the right edge of the screen and destroyed a block that was on the right edge, or maybe halfway off the screen.  The block hadn't been erased when I then jumped over to the right, even though it was now physically gone and I fell through this visible but incorporeal block.
<br />
<br />The other was in the extra stage in the final part.  One of the archers at the bottom of the screen was destroyed by me and so he destroyed the spikes to his left but also the floor under the spike directly to his left got a black 16x8 chunk erased from it.
<br />
<br />Good luck fixing those...   <img src="./images/smilies/icon_confused.gif" alt=":?" title="Confused" />

<br />I saw this too and I wonder what's the advantage of this method. I guess he can squeeze 3 lines of text plus top and bottom border in 4 lines of nametables, which is smart (you could only fit 2 lines of text the standard way).
<br />I guess for tiny boxes like this it takes the same VRAM as the whole alphabet, but if you want larger boxes then you're pretty much forced to go the standard way or else you're going to need way too much VRAM.
<br />
<br />In the case of Faxanadu, it'd be hard to see why they used that technique if you don't investigate the original Faxanadu (J). Most FC games used simple 8x8 hiragana character while Faxanadu (J) used this technique to allow a mix of large 16x16 hiragana, katakana and kanji (I guess...) characters.
<br />
<br />Small boxes looks very good for this game in fact. But in the case of a RPG for example it would probably be inappropriate.
<br />
<br />Personally I think Ufouria is probably the main source of inspiration of this game. I might be wrong, but if I had to name a similar NES game I'd name it.

<br />From top to bottom: Screenshot of game (from previous page), mock-up of the same font drawn proportionally, mock-up of a narrower font drawn proportionally.
<br />
<br />And would it be a balance killer to center the view a couple tiles in front of the character, as Yoshi's Island does? Or to let the player move the view up and down by holding up or down on the Control Pad?
