<br />Putting the data in there took time, but this time wasn't vblank time.

A different unrolled loop involving specially interleaved tile data might work better for character animation using uncompressed cels.

<br />I wasn't thinking about someone making MMC5. Afterall we don't even have MMC5 for PowerPAK yet. I was thinking of a mapper a little more like MMC3 or FME7 where you have good banking abilities and some sort of IRQ generation.

<br />
<br />And for most kinds of prototyping your powerpak will work fine until you actually make something worthwhile. Sure it increases the costs of making the carts somewhat, but the increase is still within reasonable limits, especially if the alternative is a relatively expensive CPLD that will do much less.
<br />
<br />Of course, the fact that most FPGAs are RAM based (there are exceptions to this) may seem problematic. But if you use the 15K variant the FPGA configuration you need to load is only around 24KB uncompressed, and by using some extra logic parts for the reset sequence you could make the NES CPU start at a fixed 32kb bank where the consifguration data and FPGA loading code is stored.
<br />
<br />Sure it will be somewhat expensive to mass manufacture, but if you're already considering advanced mappers I don't think it's that critical. I don't buy the argument that this is what's stopping anybody from trying out more complicated mapper designs. I think the main reason is we tend to talk too much about ideas and play around too little with them around here... ;)

<br />MMC5 is too much, but I constantly miss good bankswitching and IRQ's. My main main project went through many rewrites already because I can't decide between going with a mapper with these features that can't be easily mass producted or with a simple mapper and crazy programming tricks.
<br />
<br />I want to use advanced bankswitching and IRQ's, but I also want my cart to be easy to manifacture.
<br />
<br />Greatness will come with time, the features must be available first.
<br />
<br />Of course we talked about making advanced mappers before, but this is the first time I see someone proposing a simple, yet very versatile mapper idea.

<br />
<br />I don't really see the need for a new "better" mapper, just that it would be nice to at some point see even a cloned MMC3 board or FME7 board that anyone could use to produce their own game on. I do agree that I don't think the lack of more advanced mappers is the only thing holding anyone back, but it still does influence design. The capabilities of your mapper have to be taken into account when you design all of your game. And features like the IRQ generation you might want to have that for some fancy effects or a status bar or field break in the middle or lower part of the screen where sprite hit #0 isn't practical without burning alot of cpu time.

<br />Exactly. There is a number of things I had to cut from my main project just because I can't use a reliable IRQ system, stuff that would easily make the game look more advanced.
<br />
<br />I agree that mappers aren't magical things that cause awesome games to spontaneously pop from the ground, but they do provide means for the ones that are willing to play with a bit more power to add that "extra something": larger characters, more animations, richer music, some parallax, and so on. Sure, games can be made without those, but isn't it a nice surprise when you find those things? The games simply stand out.

<br />Well, you'll explain me how the lack of mapper-generated IRQs would prevent you from making progress to your game. There is several reasons keeping me to make progress on my game, mostly my low abilities when it comes to program enemies' AI and to design monsters overall, added to my own lazyness, but definitely not the lack of a cart generated IRQ.
<br />
<br />And nobody outside of nesdev communauty is going to be impressed by your graphics, no matter if you use raster effects or not...
<br />And I'd remember that you can generate IRQs with the DMC channels that can be combined with sprite-zero hit to trigger raster effects without wasting too much CPU time. This don't need any more hardware, and it seems to be supported by most emus. Using $2004 reads you could have more than 2 sync points without the need of external hardware but I'm pretty sure no emus would support that proprely... but the one who release a great game using that is indirectly forcing emu authors to upgrade it so it's allright.

<br />It's hard to release a great game if you can only test it on hardware.

Seems to be getting better though.  A 64 macrocell CPLD (with 32 I/O pins) can be had for little over $2.  That's about the price range that I'm interested in.
<br />
<br />If there is an inexpensive FPGA, it could be paired with an MCU for more flexible configuration options.  I suppose the same could be done with a CPLD, but they might not have enough erase/write cycles to be interesting for that (not sure).  It's just that when I think of something like this, I think the NES itself should really be able to fully use it.  It shouldn't matter as much how many crazy features the chip supports, if you can get by with only loading the parts you need at the moment.
<br />
<br />Yeah I remember thinking of the tile $FF trick, I didn't know at the time that MMC2/Punchout does that, so I was a little surprised.

And it has never ever resulted in anything but people (including me) disagreeing about exactly what hypothetical features they want on their hypothetical ideal mapper for their even more hypothetical game release.
<br />
<br />Tell you what, go finish that awesome game for any existing mapper you might find (including homebrewn powerpak ones), and I will personally spend late nights of my free time to help you design a version intended for massproduction.
<br />
<br />The reality is that doers decide what gets done, not thinkers. And doers get things done because they have learned to spend enough time on just one of all the cool crazy ideas they get. (and scaling it down where appropriate)

<br />
<br />And there is no doubt lots of other introductory material out there about fpga development in general.
<br />
<br />For the powerpak specifically, I guess the only official info is bunnyboy's CNROM example at <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.nespowerpak.com/powerpakdev1.zip">http://www.nespowerpak.com/powerpakdev1.zip</a><!-- m --> , which uses schematics rather than vhdl. Though you could try asking loopy or kyuusaku nicely to share any of their mapper implementations publically.
<br />
<br />On a practical note, a digital oscilloscope/logic analyzer and some appropriate wires from the cart edge would be extremely helpful when developing. But these things are also very expensive unless you find a really good price on a used one, so it's a luxury you might have to do without. (no, I don't have one myself)
