Roth, I know this can be overwhelming at first. In fact, you can get away with simpler sprite handlers depending on the type of your game.<br /><br />What we've been presenting you is very useful in dynamic setups, when a variable number of objects can be active at once, in which case some sort of sprite handler is necessary to cycle them, hide the unused ones and so on.<br /><br />If your game is so simple that it allows you to hardcode individual objects to certain OAM locations (should only happen when you have a small constant number of objects on screen), there is no problem with that. Just keep in mind that this is not the standard way to do it (as in "not many commercial games did it"), because it's very limited.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=95">tokumaru</a> — Sun Nov 02, 2008 12:57 pm</p><hr />

Heh, that's fun because I'm re-doing all sprites for my game those times.<br />Yes, the way Roth did it is really terrible, you shouldn't rely on any value in OAM, it's just a buffer to be sent to the PPU via $4014, nothing else. You should have a system that handles objects and all, and a routine that maze the object's sprites in OAM. This routine itself call the general-purpose sprite mazing, which can maze any sprite in OAM instantly. Basically it just compies data for a few sprites to OAM, but changin the Y and X position to add their relative componant (and check if there is overflow), and optionally change the color and flipping.<br /><br />To handle sprite cycling, I have the routine that update sprites in RAM, and I toggle some instructions every so frame, so that when I call that routine to maze object it will maze the sprite forwards every so frame and backward every other frame. This is needed because I need the objects to be drawn in a sorted order, as my game has top-down view. The sorting routine takes very long by the way, but it's doable.<br />For sprites that needs to be mazed in a specific order, I just call the ROM version of the routine so that it doesn't do sprite cycling as the RAM version does.<br /><br />I could share my routine if you guys want it, but this could discourage some people to write their own, which isn't good.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=38">Bregalad</a> — Sun Nov 02, 2008 2:32 am</p><hr />

Like, how to 'lock them together' as one thing, I guess is what I'm saying.<br /></div><br /><br />Ah, I understand. It can be rather complex. Generally, object placement is specified by one set of X,Y coords which is used as a reference point for the metasprite definition. Here's how I define metasprites:<br /><br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">MetaSprite:<br />  .db NumberOfSprites, FlipXAdjustment, FlipYAdjustment<br /><br />  .db RelativeXCoord, RelativeYCoord, Tile, Attribute<br />  .db RelativeXCoord, RelativeYCoord, Tile, Attribute<br />  ....<br /></div><br /><br />It goes on for how ever many sprites make up the object. Take a look at this definition:<br /><br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">MedusaHead:<br />   .db $03,$08,$18<br />   .db $00,$00,$B1,$03<br />   .db $08,$02,$B3,$03<br />   .db $10,$03,$B5,$03<br /></div><br /><br />This definition says that 3 sprites make up the Medusa Head. The FlipX and FlipY adjustment are there to adjust the position of the sprites if it is flipped horizontally or vertically, as sometimes it needs to be adjusted because it looks weird when you flip back and forth. So if this metasprite is flipped horizontally, it will be placed 8 pixels to the right to make it look like a smooth flipping.<br /><br />Now say I wanted to place the medusa head at 123, 42. My drawing routine would take this metasprite, and assuming there's no flipping, would put the sprites at the following coords:<br /><br />123, 42<br />131, 44<br />139, 45<br /><br />Because those relative coords place the sprites relative to the object's X/Y coords.<br /><br />Don't get confused by my order of definitions. I know it's standard to have Y, Tile, Attribute, then X, but it makes no difference performance-wise the way I have it set up, and it's just easier for me to read as X, Y, Tile, Attribute for me.<br /><br />Does that make any more sense? That's how I specify groups of sprites as one object.<br /><br />You should have a sprite drawing routine that takes a list of objects that are going to be drawn on screen, and use metasprite definitions like this to have it draw them accordingly.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=138">Celius</a> — Sat Nov 01, 2008 11:43 pm</p><hr />

Yes, yes, Tokumaru is completely right. An object is just a thing in the game world, usually made of sprites. A candle or an enemy in Castlevania is an object. It's usually something that has it's own mind/purpose.<br /><br />But it's great for sprite cycling to do it this way, and it's a lot less coding. For example, you could tell the sprite drawing routine to place an enemy at coordinates 143,102, and have that enemy's sprite data defined somewhere in RAM. This data tells the arrangement of the sprites + the attribute data. The routine will also have to be told if the object is flipped in any way.<br /><br />Oh, and just so you know, these routines can take a very long time to execute! There's just a lot it has to compute. Though you can optimize the routine to take less time, obviously. There was actually a topic about it:<br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://nesdev.com/bbs/viewtopic.php?t=3772">http://nesdev.com/bbs/viewtopic.php?t=3772</a><!-- m --><br /><br />Where before posting, I'd always thought of having to work with sprites in a hardcoded way. But it's so much easier when you don't have to.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=138">Celius</a> — Sat Nov 01, 2008 7:56 pm</p><hr />

You could even have the routine automatically handle the flipping of each sprite based on the flipping of the object, as well as other attributes (such as palette changes because of water, and so on).<br /><br />This makes it all very dynamic, in a way that a certain object is not tied to specific OAM positions, which is really bad for sprite cycling, for example.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=95">tokumaru</a> — Sat Nov 01, 2008 6:55 pm</p><hr />

The MSX has an interesting sprite feature: When a sprite is placed at a certain coordinate, all sprites after it are ignored. The NES doesn't have such a feature, so you have to manually hide all the sprites you're not using, preferably at the bottom of the screen.<br /><br />Now, I'm not sure I got what your sprite problem is, but it seems to me like you are using them in a very hardcoded way. Most games have dynamic ways of drawing sprites (routines to draw them based on coordinates of objects and sprite definitions), because of sprite cycling and many other reasons, and they are rendered every frame, even if they didn't change since the last frame. Just look at the OAM area of any game in FCEUXD and you'll see how crazy that part of the memory is.<br /><br />Anyway, a quick fix for you would probably be to clear all the sprites before using them, with code similar to what smkd suggested. However, as Celius observed, the optimal solution would be to use all the sprites you want and only clear the remaining ones, but that may require you to do heavier changes to your program.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=95">tokumaru</a> — Sat Nov 01, 2008 6:22 pm</p><hr />

So is your problem that some sprites during the cutscenes are carried over to gameplay because there aren't enough ones used during gameplay to completely overwrite the ones from the cutscenes? If so, that sounds like you're not clearing the sprite page before you write to it, which would be wise to do when switching "modes". Also, you should use the concept of "objects" to draw sprites on the screen every frame, overwriting all 256 bytes of the sprite page each frame. If you use this, you can have a list of all the objects that will be drawn on screen, and once they're drawn, clear out the rest with $FF. Sorry if that doesn't make any sense.<br /><br />EDIT: smkd, that seems like a pretty wasteful way to do it. Why not overwrite the sprites previously displayed during the sprite drawing routine and when all that are meant to be displayed are drawn, then clear the remainder?<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=138">Celius</a> — Sat Nov 01, 2008 6:06 pm</p><hr />
