There is a diagram detailed on this forum, I'm not sure where exactly, about hooking up a 16 bit EPROM to a SNES cartridge by using I think 3 simple logic chips to handle decoding. In my opinion it seems easier than fitting 4 of the 8 megabit eproms in and wiring the decoder chip up. <br /><br />With the SRAM swap, I've heard you can swap a 2KB for a 8KB chip, and ROMLAB has some sort of guide on it. But I don't know about anything else.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=1726">MottZilla</a> — Fri Jan 29, 2010 10:55 am</p><hr />

Thanks Banshaku. That is what I'm doing. I'm just pointing out the facts and sharing my opinion. There are people that repros appeal to, such as people with a sort of collectors attitude where they like to have their own built cartridges in some collection, and then there is the unsympathetic group that build repros in hopes to sell them for profit. <br /><br />For the average gamer, or really any gamer, the flash cartridges and copiers are a much better investment. The cost of a EPROM programmer and parts quickly will become more than most alternatives. A classic Copier can be obtained for as little as $30 pretty easily. Prices will vary but they will certainly be less than even a decent EPROM programmer. It's also important to consider the labor involved in building repros. If you are a gamer, and just want to play a game, solutions like flash cartridges, Powerpak, and copiers are for you. There is little difference playing on a bootleg cartridge, copier, flashcart, or powerpak. You may think so but for the stand point of playing the game it is the same.<br /><br />Also as Banshaku pointed out, this is not a "help me bootleg games" forum. Also I don't see how you can call Flash Carts for idiots. Do you think that soldering and building bootlegs is hard? It's not. It is however quite tedious. It seems to me as I made the point before, repro bootlegs are for two purposes only. People that like to build a collection of homemade bootlegs, and people that hope to profit from selling them.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=1726">MottZilla</a> — Thu Jan 28, 2010 9:58 pm</p><hr />

I understand your point but I want to remind you that it is a dev forum: not "help me bootleg my game" one.  Motzilla is not rewared by any manufacturers or anything. It just that many beginners comes for making repro just to play their games when the easier way is a copier, flash cart or something similar. Often they are not aware of that and the investment in the hardware you need to make that repro is a lot more than that flash cart/copier.<br /><br />A flash card is the same thing as a repro: it is a cart that contain a game on eeprom. The advantage it that it can have any games at any time. From a hardware point of view, it does the same thing so your point about "not the same thing" is moot. From a hardware point of view, it is the same thing, the rest is in your head.<br /><br />Sorry to be rude but this attitude piss me off too.  Recently this board as been flooded with many request about repro because it seems to be trendy or something.  Motzilla is just making sure to make people realize that there is other alternative to repro so he's doing nothing wrong.<br /><br />Sorry again. End of my rant.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3559">Banshaku</a> — Thu Jan 28, 2010 4:07 pm</p><hr />

It is possible I imagine. But it would probably make more sense to use a single 27C322 with some other chips to replace the original maskrom on the original cartridge instead. The ROMLAB site had stuff about swapping SRAM chips but there could be errors in the diagrams, I have no idea. If you just want to play the game, a Tototek or MashMods flash cartridge would be a much more simple and useful solution to playing it on real hardware. Building repros is relatively expensive compared to a reusable device like a Flash Cartridge, PowerPAK, or old style Copier unit.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=1726">MottZilla</a> — Tue Jan 26, 2010 3:13 pm</p><hr />
