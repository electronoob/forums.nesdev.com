It was fixed a while back to not freeze, but some of the tracks just start at different spots. Or something. You can hear how they sound or start differently in-game (all tracks are easy to find within moments of starting the game, there's only title/ bgm/ battle music).
<br />
<br />I don't think I've had problems with Silver Surfer freezing? I'll have to dig for whichever NSF I used, because I'm pretty sure I sampled the whole soundtrack from the NSF at some point...

<br />
<br />I've tried the Silver Surfer nsf from knurek's, akumu's, zophar's, and HCS's archives. They all freeze on track 9, which is the high score theme: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6mKJYnr_l2E">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6mKJYnr_l2E</a><!-- m -->
<br />
<br />Though I did find one that works. It was the one on arc-nova's.
<br />
<br />So, never mind. Problem solved. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Now it is time for a massive update this month. I haven't released this many at one time in a long time. A note about some of the NSFs, I have tested all of them in various players and including on the NES PowerPak. With the exception of Cyberball that doesn't play right in NotSoFatSo. I had some help this month, thanks to thefox for assisting me with Cybernoid. Also, a big thanks to Dommmaster1994 for finding composer names, playing entire games to find credits, number of songs and to see if the songs sound correct for some games. I'm also happy to add that finally, I have ripped all the Advanced Dungeon and Dragons games. Also, I'd like it if someone plays Swords and Serpents all the way through to see which tunes are right and which ones are not. Some of them I think might be glitch songs that start at the wrong time or add in another part of a song to verified good song. I still have a little bit of work to do on Klax but it's as close as it's ever been right now. If anyone finds any problems with these rips, let me know and I can try to work some of the problems out, perhaps. 
<br />
<br /> There are some other games that I'm having problems with, although I am close to getting them done. Classic Concentration; there are two songs that I haven't been able to get. Major League Baseball; there are two songs that I haven't been able to get. Ultima Warriors of Destiny; I've actually managed to get a couple of tunes working but the rest I have not, I found four music banks. Dudes With Attitude; I am close to getting this one except that in the rip the songs starts several seconds later which is a problem that I need to work out. Remote Control; I have a completely stripped 32KB ROM with only the music but haven't been able to get it to work in NSF form yet. Rollerblade Racer; I've only been able to get that one to work in Nintendulator so far.
