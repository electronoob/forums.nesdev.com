Older fighting games (like Street Fighter II) are not computationally intensive at all, seeing as there are few active objects and hardly any object management (objects aren't created/destroyed that frequently or in large quantities).

I don't think SF2 would have any trouble on the NES. For instance, unlike SNES, you have nearly instant bankswitching to load new fighter graphics for any frame of animation. And I do think typically the level/arenas are only 2 screen widths wide so you don't even have to update nametables during scrolling. You'd have all the time you could need to run a GOOD fighting game engine. An experienced developer/team could probably make a version of SF2 on NES that is actually fun to play. And as I said, there are numerous ways you could have all 6 attacks.

Rotation, scaling, and shearing are all special cases of affine transformation. Rotsprite and Rotpixels are designed to perform affine transformation on pixel art while avoiding some of the undesirable edge artifacts commonly associated with nearest-neighbor resampling.

Sprites overlapping one another to expand color palette should be minimized in order to keep flickering down. Maybe Ryu could just be dark brown, skin, and white for his body, and then a single red sprite could handle his headband and maybe dark blue hair shine? Those SNES-based sprites look pretty good, but I would be worried for what it would be like with two sets on-screen, especially with two players using different palettes.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Mappers like MMC3 allow to switch 1K/2K parts of the CHR, so it helps a lot for a fighting game - you can select needed frames of two characters with just two register writes. With CHR RAM you would have to upload frames, which will take many TV frames to complete and require double buffering, as you only can upload like 300 bytes per frame. So actually bankswitching is the only real option for a fighting game on the NES, and that is what they actually use (TMNT Tournament Fighters, for example).<br /><br />Answering to the original question, well, with all these chinese bootleg Street Fighter ports and other fighting games (Fatal Fury, Samurai Spirits, Mortal Kombat, etc), it is clear that it is possible - these ports just needs some polishing that is lacking, especially in the controls and the music. A good fighting SF-like game is also there, the Tournament Fighters. One major problem is that large sprites will have to flicker inevitably, so choosing a smaller size, perhaps without BG scrolling even (not really needed with small sprites), could help to create better impression.

Shame they didn't port the music =| Also that's some rather good job with the backgrounds there (and even moreso with the sprites). Three of the characters are gone, but then again those are the big size characters so I guess that may be the reason. And Claw is still a bitch as usual.<br /><br />And there must be several revisions because in the cartridge I had only eight backgrounds would be used at all (Dictator's stage uses Chun Li's background). I don't get that problem in emulators. No idea why, probably a different ROM. (also I used to have the great idea to play the game at the hardest difficulty back then... *sigh*)

Using 32-128KB of CHR-RAM on a MMC3 give you 32-128 banks of RAM to work with and 4 of them (1KB each) are visible at once for use with sprites.  So 2 banks per character, or some other uneven method of sharing with one fixed/shared and 3 for animations.  32-128banks is quite a few banks if they only have to store what needs to be viewed in the current fight, so they don't have to be horrendously optimized.  With that much you probably wouldn't even have to draw the characters because of bankswitching.

The biggest problem would be vblank time, and that can be extended with a Battletoads-style top status bar and late enabling of rendering.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />There are other non-pirate fighting games on the NES besides Joy Mecha Fight and the Ninja Turtles game. I can think of Datach's <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LERxMJgSOg0" class="postlink">Dragon Ball Z</a> and <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fvs4dHvSOw" class="postlink">Yuu Yuu Hakusho</a> games, which use fairly small sprites. I believe these games use CHR-RAM rather than bankswitching.<br /><br />Also, the Dragon Ball Z RPG games have fighting sequences that look a lot like fighting games, even though characters aren't directly controllable. They do make use of the background color as an extra sprite color though, and one of the characters might be drawn with background tiles instead of sprites, preventing flickering by sacrificing background detail.
