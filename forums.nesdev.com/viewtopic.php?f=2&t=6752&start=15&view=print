<br />Meh, the bit of money that would come with it would just make more sense to make a new game and then work harder on both, so I'd like that, but PD would be good to....wait, this is going to be a NROM game, right?  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_surprised.gif" alt=":o" title="Surprised" />

<br />If you have an idea for a game that won't fit on the NES due to <a href="http://wiki.nesdev.com/w/index.php/Limitations" class="postlink">hardware limitations</a> and won't fit on a PC due to the lack of home theater PCs (that is, PCs connected to a TV-sized monitor) among non-geeks, you have to make it for a modern console, and there are <a href="http://warioworld.com/apply/" class="postlink">two requirements for that</a>. One is leasing office space, and the other is "game industry experience". I don't think a game on your CV counts as "game <em>industry</em> experience" unless you've been paid.
<br />
<br />But then NROM games like the ones for this compo aren't the sort of things that sell themselves alone.

<br />Back on topic, are the enemies just placed there to look good or do you have the engine doing it dynamically yet?

<br />Interesting point. But if you get to the point that sombody consider to hire you in the video-game industry, you can give a link to your potential employer so that it can play your game, it will definitely be a HIGH plus for you. I don't think this will ever be happening to any of us, but it it were to happen to me, I'd be glad to show off that I made a game or even just a game engine, all from scratch. Not many people could claim this I guess.

<br />The console makers demand more. If you want to get a devkit so that you can get onto a console's download store, you have to show that you are capable of making something that people want to <em>buy</em>, not just play for two minutes and go on to the next <a href="http://www.tetrisconcept.net/forum/showthread.html?p=29783#post29783" class="postlink">steaming pile of tech demo</a>.

<br />Jeroen: XNA has <a href="http://pineight.com/mw/index.php?title=XNA" class="postlink">known limitations</a> that make it suitable only for "little toy games", as <a href="http://slashdot.org/comments.pl?sid=1838584&amp;cid=34018016" class="postlink">a Slashdot user put it</a>. It also needs a PC made in the past four years or so with Windows and a discrete video card, and I don't have that.

Yes it's not gears of war or halo in terms of technical achievement but you can make fun and GOOD games with xna, and most importantly on modern consoles. Also I think having to have a modern pc is a far better option then having to spend several thousands on actual licenses no? I AM aware of the limitations...but I do think that as an indie studio you can make a decent game with it, for cheap.

Allegro seems okay, but I can't find any info on it. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" />

I thought "indie" was short for independent, and it sounds to me like Microsoft is turning the definition on it's head, seems like anyone developing under their system would be very much dependent on Microsoft with their forced standards and rules.  I didn't know that they even get to choose what words you can and cannot use in your game, what kind of independence is that?
<br />
<br />Sorry for off-topic post, Dwedit your game looks pretty cool from the screens.

Just looking it up quickly I see that everything has to be in C#, not C/C++/anything else.  So you also have to use a Microsoft-designed language, it seems they basically "own" your game in a sense.  Maybe there is a C to C# compiler though.
<br />
<br />65024U: I forgot to mention too, look into SDL and that tutorial I posted in the other thread.  Allegro probably is mentioned more because it's been around for longer, I remember a lot of emulators in DOS and other stuff used it.  SDL must be more recent but it is used a lot, and well-documented.  It's not as easy as NES development though, overall (IMO).

Isn't it standard DirectX with some C++/C?</div><br />XNA on the Xbox 360 uses an API reportedly similar to Direct3D. However, you can't use C or standard C++; instead, you have to use C# or a language called "C++/CLI with /clr:safe" that's C# with C++-style syntax. You can't take your existing C++ codebase and make a new XNA front-end for it because standard C++ and C++/CLI with /clr:safe are not compatible languages. In addition, you can't use DirectSound; instead, you have to use XACT and lose the ability to synthesize audio at runtime. To break these limitations, you need an office and a commercial game on your CV.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">Why not just do it on PC in the first place</div><br />Because most of your audience has their PC connected to a monitor far smaller than a living room television, and it's hard to fit four people around such a monitor.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">is there any real way to do games on PC easily with well documented programs?

<br />SDL and Allegro are the popular libraries for native development that's cross-platform among Windows, Linux, and Mac OS X. Both let you use OpenGL for graphics if needed.
<br />
<br />And I agree it was a hijack, but I'll forgive and forget if you let me know at which point you want the topic split.
