Ah, don't worry about the hardware-side of things too much.  Writing an interesting game is more of an achievement then building a simple memory storage interface.  You can put a read and a write routine in your game, and just by changing those 2 routines later (the hardware dudes will supply the code), it could read and write from any hardware.  For modest amount of testing of your save/load, you could just keep it in a .SAV file and hex edit the data in and out manually, as most of the needed testing will be for the PPU and game logic, I'm sure.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=10">Memblers</a> — Sat Sep 25, 2010 2:21 pm</p><hr />

Here.s the problem that I see...<br /><br />While your method would work for people that live close to eachother, many NES geeks live all around the world, and if you made a game based on the exchange of data, people it would be ideal to be able to share that data with friends all over the world. <br /><br />How would you get the data to them? You'd need a way to interface your storage device with a PC, upload the data to a hard drive or other storage card, then e-mail it. This means creating a USB link between your dongle and a PC, which may be as complex as using an SD card on the game cartridge. <br /><br />Id you want to go the route you are planning, you should investigate the Famicom 'Battle Box', which was a device for storing FC game save data after power-off for games that didn't include battery-backed RAM. I'll have to look at its schematics to see how it did it, but you can find them on-line to view yourself as well. (If you can't, PM me and I'll send them to you.)<br /><br />It only worked with titles specifically designed for it, and there way no way to extract the game data from the deice externally, but you could plug it into another Famicom, which is essentially what you're talking about. The ability to save game data this way and share it is nothing new, but being able to send that data to another person or interface the NES to a PC in a manner conducive to doing so is (thus far) relatively new. <br /><br />Only the PowerPak can do it, thus far. (in fact, it would be possible to create a custom mapper with a serial number and sell the game as a ROM that required a custom mapper, generate a mapper file for the PowerPak with an encrypted serial key in its source--randomly generated for each single one sold--- then track the serial numbers to prevent piracy and do this entirely on the PowerPak. Just a wild idea, probably due to lack of sleep...)<br /><br />As to SD cards being frail, people trust them to gold photographs taken on vacation, and they are common and easy to replace (inexpensively). It's a simple manner to back-up whatever you have on the card and it you lose it, or it is damaged, you can replace it. If you design a device with internal memory, and it develops a fault, then not only will you still lose the game data, but you'll have to take it apart, desolder a SM memory chip and put a new on in its place. <br /><br />Additionally, SD cards are pretty tough. I've only had one die. It wqs a Sandisk USB2+ folding card, and I accidentally snapped it at the folding seam when it was sticking out of a device, severing the ground connection. I recall that I lost another one that became saturated in Coca-Cola and developed corrosion, but i can always clean its contacts if I ever need to do so. <br /><br />They're really tough little buggers, and as long as it's fully inserted into something, I don't see how you'd break one. (The folding card is an exception, because, well, it was hinged and I bent it the wrong way.) You may lose the card, but as long as you can plug it into a C (or Mac, or Solaris station, etc.) at the end of the day, that isn't a problem.<br /><br />If all you want to do is develop a game that uses an external device to hold game SRAM data, but you don't want to share it across a network,(which will severely limit its usefulness, and your sales these days), you should essentially clone the 'Battle Box.' That's all it was, and that is all you'd need. <br /><br />If you want to ensure that people can share the data on the Internet though, it will require connectability of some sort, and if you want to make it easy, it needs to be SD or USB. Anything else will limit who can use it. <br /><br />Many systems today have only USB and micro-card ports, so serial is out, and if the USB controller doesn't recognize it and its data natively (using built-in or existing software drivers), then you'll need specialized software to view and extract it, which you'd have to make multi-platform (PC, Mac PPC/x86 dual-binary//Linux) in order to ensure market durability.<br /><br />That's why, in my eyes, SD makes the most sense, but 'tisn't my project, so don't feel any pressure from me, unless my word that if I couldn't plug it into a Mac and share it with my mates means I wouldn't buy it is meaningful. <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" /> (Just about all of my mates that play NES/FC games live a long distance--500-600Km--away from me...)<br /><br />I only have three local friends that do, and they don't own the console themselves, but visit on occasion to relive past memories. I'm pretty sure this isn't too uncommon, considering the age of the console, after all. <br /><br />-Xious<br /><br />UPDATE: I looked at the schematic for the Battle Box, and it indeed is exactly what you need to view, as it uses the $4017 register signals available on Port II of the NES. If you improve it to add USB attachability to a PC, you can pretty much use it as-is.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=4070">Xious</a> — Sat Sep 25, 2010 8:12 am</p><hr />

Well I was thinking if we had a dongle to go the P2 port or Exp. port that it would be easier to swap stuff. If we made the NV storage on the cart, tranferring would have to be done by ram and I wouldn't trust that at all because if you inserted the cart you wanted to transfer it to, it might fail and youd never know it.<br /><br /><br />But with the NV storage on lets say the P2 port, You'd send items or whatever to it, turn off the system, insert your friends cart, then give him the items on the dongle. It seems more safe to me, am I right?<br /><br /><br />And then you could always do Serial RAM on the cart, but then the 8K of extra RAM would not be usable by the system so I think thats out.<br /><br /><br />And by the looks of online, the serial chips require 2 pins. Could D3 be used by the devices that if D3=1 then memory dongle was being read, where if D3=0 then then Controller is hooked up to D0 instead?<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=4311">3gengames</a> — Sat Sep 25, 2010 6:35 am</p><hr />

With the 2nd controller port, you'll almost perpetually have access to $4017's D3 and D4 registers. The d0 register is used by the 2nd controller, so although you can utilize it, you'll need to ensure that when reading or writing to your external memory device, you disable all external D0 input to avoid corruption. <br /><br />(I expect that you will permit pass-through of the signals required to operate the 2nd player controller.) I dot remember if the NES 2nd port has /OE for both $4017 ans $4016, but it may. I can't remember the singular remaining line's allocation (+5DVC, GND, $4017.OE, $4017.0, $4017.3, $4017.4 and...one more. (I think it's a data write line for the Latch signal?)<br /><br />If you're making your own game, and your own carts, may I suggest adding an external memory device to it for SD storage? You could interface it directly with the internal SRAM, and allow for nonvolatile storage of game data. This way, you have a fully integrated, software-controlled storage medium directly on your cartridges, which would be much easier to use for the exchange of game data and wouldn't require extra dongles that people have to constantly swap out. <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />-Xious<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=4070">Xious</a> — Sat Sep 25, 2010 1:49 am</p><hr />

And that P2 port serial device seems like an EPIC thing to have, so you can carry your Pokemon in it, like the little tiny Pokeball thing for DS.<br /><br /><br />One down side....If I start this project.....There's going to be ALOT of cart testing and ROM burning, since Emulators probably don't have something like this implemented...yet.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=4311">3gengames</a> — Thu Sep 23, 2010 5:03 pm</p><hr />

Actually, you won't lose Famicom compatibility if you do it right (through $4017, mostly - and it won't interfere with the controllers).  Toploader support is a lost cause, sadly, but isn't nearly as common as the old front-loader anyways.  The expansion device I'm working on should work on NES or Famicom.  And yeah you'll be able to save and load data from there, I'm planning on having it provide more non-volatile storage than anyone would ever want, heheh.<br /><br />You can get a large serial flashrom, say 4Mbytes, for just a few bucks.  Cheap!<br /><br />If you want to copy your SRAM data off of a cart, for backup and restore, you can do it today if you use a CopyNES.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=10">Memblers</a> — Thu Sep 23, 2010 2:48 pm</p><hr />

I think Famicom won't be needed and Toploading would be nice since they're a little more popular, but toasters are just EVERYWHERE, and the only things I have.<br /><br />Yet the 2 player thing would be smaller, easier to make, but then then the P2 port would be taken up.

I've never done serial stuff so this also kinda of scares me....<br /><br />Also, I am thinking of doing this for the Pokemon project I have planned next, no promises, but this would be a necessity and I would even love to find other things to make any other games more interactive.<br /><br /><br />EDIT:<br /><br />Also, the extra pin on the cart.....I was thinking of using a MMC1 and 512K rom and a 8K CHR-RAM with 8K of SRAM if this happens. I doubt there would be anymore hardware on the cart left over for such a thing so it might be better to go the P2 port-&gt;Serial Flash ROM. Wow, I can't believe I never thought of that as an option! -facepalm- You guys know all the good tricks.

So you want an external memory card that your own game can read and write, so that players can trade doodles or pokeymans or whatever between Game Paks. There are two ways to do this: either an I2C flash connected to the expansion port, or an I2C flash inside a dongle on controller port 2.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=9">tepples</a> — Thu Sep 23, 2010 1:55 pm</p><hr />
