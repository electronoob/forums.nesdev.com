I'm the one who first posted about the mod after finding that wacky datasheet - apparnetly 1K to ground is the way to go. I've had different results between two seemingly identical SNES machines, however - one shows up perfectly on any TV which takes YPbPr, while another was almost completely washed out (prompting the need for the 1K resistor...). Can anyone shed some light as to why the two machines would act differently?<br /><br />The Jr doesn't have an even vaguely compatible encoder I don't believe... I thought they all had the S-RGB encoder that spits out clamped RGB, S-video, and composite, like the late model 1 SNES.<br /><br />@Kyuusaku, thanks for your clear explanation of how the signals should be properly terminated. I will modify my guide accordingly.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=5314">mikejmoffitt</a> — Fri Jun 08, 2012 5:49 pm</p><hr />

Very interesting read. I decided that my SNES S-Video output was doing a good job so the mod was not really needed for me, specially after hearing some people mentioning the component video mod was giving them a ''weird'' image or color. But if kyuusaku would be willing to redesign the circuit with his recommendation I would definitely try it.<br /><br />Also, I like the comment about the proper thing rarely being done because it's deemed "unnecessary". You know, deodorant is unnecessary but I sure as hell like the fact that most people still choose to go that route <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_lol.gif" alt=":lol:" title="Laughing" /><p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=4859">SkinnyV</a> — Fri Jun 08, 2012 5:04 pm</p><hr />

Indeed, I am constantly amazed at how forgiving electronics are.<br /><br />Most times when you are required to ground a pin, I find just lifting it "gets the job done." Yet it's obviously horribly wrong.<br /><br />I've even managed to get an SNES controller working without the +5V line connected. Somehow it pulls the power from the other lines by some magic I don't understand.<br /><br />Certainly possible the hardware will fail later as a result of these shortcuts, sadly.<br /><br />Definitely good to list the correct way for those who are able and not lazy. I may attempt this info on my RGB circuit. Right now I just have 220uF cap + 100ohm resistor (no 75's here) on each line (RGB+CSync [-not- CVBS]) Resistor's only needed on SNES Jr because the image is -way- too bright otherwise.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=375">byuu</a> — Thu Jun 07, 2012 11:25 pm</p><hr />

Doing things the right way is rarely necessary in life.<br /><br />I know that video needs to be terminated correctly. I know that TVs have very forgiving AGC and most people will never know that they're doing it wrong. I know that when issues do arise people will apply fallacies and will blame everything but the true culprit, which is probably out of their repertoire. That's the nature of electronics and everyone is guilty of it, some are just more guilty than others.<br /><br />As someone who strives to understand the "right way", it irritates me to see bad design succeed as it often does, especially when it involves the alteration of remaining video game stock. That was the only point of my post--to help anyone else on their quest for the "right way".<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=20">kyuusaku</a> — Thu Jun 07, 2012 4:30 pm</p><hr />

@ kyuusaku - After reading your reply I remembered reading about the internals and their differences for PAL/NTSC scart cables. This got me to doing some reading and searching old posts for RGB issues with SNES/SFC even ones that you had posted in several years ago. Thank you for the little memory jog and further excersize, tomorrow I am going to rewire this mod based on what you have said and others likewise.<br /><br />@ byuu - it's not easy anymore <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=":wink:" title="Wink" /><br /><br /><br />thank you<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=2415">marvelus10</a> — Wed Jun 06, 2012 11:12 pm</p><hr />

Realllllly shouldn't call it easy. Easy to skilled people, sure, but that's obvious enough.<br /><br />Even with a few months of soldering experience, I totally botched my first SNES Jr when soldering to those pins. I did eventually pull it off, but it wasn't fun.<br /><br />Chances are if you're of the skill level of using Radio Shack irons, you probably shouldn't attempt something like this unless you know you can do it or don't care about the hardware much.<br /><br />Also, there's a tiny bit of interference when running your own wires off that chip and out the SNES. But still absolutely worth it compared to the horrible RGB output quality of older SNES units.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=375">byuu</a> — Wed Jun 06, 2012 10:58 pm</p><hr />

Not surprisingly it doesn't look like anybody is using the signals correctly, even after 10 pages of wall-o-texts. The datasheet apparently shows 1K resistors to GND at the outputs, those are required because the last stage is a common-collector/drain amplifier buffering the matrix output. The actual output impedance will be very low. For proper use the Pb/Pr outputs must be amplified 2X (approx 6 dB gain) and series terminated with 75 ohm. It may be possible to do single-ended parallel termination, or dual-parallel termination to skip the amplifier, but they present a heavy load to the output.<br /><br />Since apparently only Y has internal gain, and it sounds like people are simply series terminating the output with 75 ohms, that means their Pb and Pr will have half the appropriate amplitude leading to incorrect color (not brightness which is constrained to luminance).<br /><br />The correct use is: output pin -&gt; high impedance 6 dB amp (PNP input) -&gt; 100 or 220 uF C -&gt; series 75 ohm R -&gt; out<br /><br />or with single parallel: pin -&gt; 100 or 220uF C -&gt; out<br /><br />dual-parallel termination: pin -&gt; 100 or 220uF C -&gt; shunt 75 ohm R to GND -&gt; output<br /><br />The caps and circuit order are very important because significant current can be saved by removing the DC offset. The caps can probably be smaller since Pb and Pr technically don't have low-frequency components like Y does.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=20">kyuusaku</a> — Wed Jun 06, 2012 4:47 pm</p><hr />

You can pick up inexpensive upscalers that will accept 240p then I'm sure it would be fine if you were to run into the issue I had on my plasma.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=2415">marvelus10</a> — Tue Jun 05, 2012 7:49 pm</p><hr />
