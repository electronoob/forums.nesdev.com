	</div> (I've erased some of the metal and polysilicon for clarity) They really liked their transmission gates in this era.<br /><br />It's a synchronous up/down counter. Carry out indicates whether the next more significant bit should toggle on the next φ0. It always flows from top to bottom; at the end of each 8 bits there's a big hook that goes to the next one. Carry out from the last bit doesn't go anywhere (node 307).<br /><br />——<br /><br />From left to right, the columns in 2a03dead are: I/O buffers to 2A03-internal data bus; 8 LSBs of counter, 8 middle bits of counter; 8 MSBs of counter; control logic; 8 bits of ... broken prescaler? I guess I can fix that:<br /><br />The control bits ($11) seem to be:<br />* $00 = 1/8th prescaler (not ÷16 ??)<br />* $01 = Count rising edges on JOY2<br />* $10 = 1/128th prescaler (not ÷256 ??)<br />* $11 = Count falling edges on JOY2<br /><br />All of these options are inscrutable:<br /> * Why is there no smaller prescaler option?<br /> * Why would we need to count 2³¹ cycles? That's 20 minutes. It seems Memblers was on to something?<br /> * JOY2 is normally an output controlled by software. But even if it was an input, why would we want to be able to count a choice of rising edges or falling edges?<br /><br />Requesting a load (either by writing to $401F with $40 set or the automatic reload) also clears the prescaler.<br /><br />Also, I don't quite trust those exact prescalers; I think they &quot;should&quot; be ÷16 and ÷256 given the number of bits in-between.<br /><br />——<br /><br />There's two places in the control logic where things were meant to be readable, but are miswired (<s>there&#39;s no &quot;read from $401F&quot; signal and</s> it incorrectly uses the &quot;write to $401F&quot; signal):<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">$401F reads: &#91;Exxx xxxI&#93;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; |||| ||||<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; |||| |||+-- Interrupt would be requested<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; |+++-+++--- special internal-timer open bus value<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; +---------- Interrupt is allowed to be requested (i.e. value written to $401F &amp; $80)<br /></div> (Look at nodes 875 and 916)<br /><br />Reads from $401F <em>are</em> detected and <em>do</em> acknowledge the interrupt.<br /><br />——<br /><br />Oh, speaking of errors, they're incorrectly generating all the &quot;read from $401C/D/E&quot; strobes ... detecting writes instead of reads.<br /><br />There's a missing polysilicon-metal junction with node 356. It should be connected to node 60, but isn't. (in hardware. Obviously the sim doesn't have it either.)<br /><br />And the $401F &amp; $06 bits <s>are still inscrutable ... but it</s> appears to be some alternate function for JOY1.<br /><br />$401F &amp; $04 = directly controls JOY1. When the count becomes 0, it causes both $06 bits to invert.<br />$401F &amp; $02 = doesn't appear to actually change anything, even though the latched value toggles.<br /><br />I have no idea what this functionality was intended to be.
