<br />Bomberman GB 3 (J) = Japanese release only
<br />
<br />I expected you already were aware of this if you were requesting Bomberman GB 2/3, which was (J) only.
<br />
<br />Ripped Bomberman GB (J). The simplicity from Bomberman GB 2 was here, without the complex stuff to add 2 hours of effort.
<br />
<br />Ripped Bomberman GB 3. It suffered from the same problems that #2 had, but with a simpler solution. Just an hour total, instead of 2 after locating the music banks.
<br />
<br />Ripped Bomberman Quest. The sheer number of tracks that needed sorting was the worst of it. Internally, the bank-switching used matched up with what the GBS needed, so that made it pretty easy to get it working.

<br />
<br />Actually I was aware only that Bomberman GB (J) was released stateside as Wario Blast. 
<br />
<br />Still, thanks for the Bomberman rips. Nice music there, as per usual with Hudson Soft.

<br />If Dubble's gamerip of Gameboy Bomberman games is to be believed, Bomberman GB games were composed by Yasuhiko Fukuda (with the standard Bomberman tracks by Jun Chikuma), while Bomberman Quest was done by Keiji Ueno, Goro Takahashi.
<br />
<br />Great rips too!

<br />
<br />I added a modified, but still broken, Harvest Moon 2 rip. It plays super-fast in my modified player, but it does work. If I could figure out why it keeps refusing to work in the normal player, or wants to keep being difficult in the emulator, I'd have a better chance of working out more natsume drivers. As it stands, they have a nightmarish quality to them...
<br />
<br />Added a fully working Harvest Moon 3 rip. The main problem was rewriting a banking table/including correct banking, and deciphering a problem where writes to 3000 were immediately un-banking the banks that were put there by writes to 2000.
<br />
<br />Added Alleyway, F-1 Race, Felix the Cat, Bomberman Collection(Game Selecter), Bomber Boy.

<br />The version I used to rip the GBS was the version I played the entire way through, and when I got to the credits screen, there was no music present.
<br />
<br />Edit: This is in regards to my DK rip.
