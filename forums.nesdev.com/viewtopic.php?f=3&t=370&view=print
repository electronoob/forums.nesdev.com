		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I'm guessing such a thing doesn't exist, otherwise there would be an actual iNES-&gt;UNIF convertor... But anyways, I have been wanting to make such a utility for ages but just don't have data for it to use. boardtable.txt is the only doc I've seen, but it only has the board name, no mirroring info and the like. Nestopia seems to have a good database packed in, but some of the board names seem ambiguous, for example some are simply called MMC1 rather than the specific board name.
<br />
<br />I'm working on a FCEU fork, and I would really, REALLY like to remove iNES support completely and if one were to try and load one, it would bitch and force you to convert. I don't want to go on a rant about it, but the fact that iNES is still around just irritates me to no end.
<br />
<br />I'm sure some will not agree with that, but some of the arguments I've heard that keep people sticking to iNES seem ridiculous to me. Like IPS patching not working with UNIF. WTF? Yes it's true that existing tools wouldn't work anymore, but an emu could easily remap the IPS and do a softpatch. Or if you like to do hard patching, creating a program to do so is trivial.
<br />
<br />About the UNIF format itself, I of course love it. But I personally would like to see some additions to it. Supplemental info like publisher and year released would be nice. Something else I would really like to do is have an SRAM block and store your save in the same file. I of course would have the option to clear the block out. This wouldn't work if you were running from a read-only source, but I figured if that were the case, it would just create a local copy.
<br />
<br />And finally (I know people will hate this idea), I think it would be cool if the UNIF container had blocks for holding images of the cart, box, and manual. Yes this would bloat the hell out of the filesize, but if you don't like that, you could always delete those blocks. I would really like it for manuals to be converted into vector type format. That would make them typically a lot smaller and much more useful. But I know this is unrealistic, wishful thinking. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />
<br />
<br />But back on topic, I'm ready to make a conversion tool but I'm gonna need help on the database. I certainly don't want to be making guesses based off the iNES mapper number. I own ~200 carts so if needed I can have the fun job of opening them all up to get what I need <img src="./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" /> Kevin Horton seems like he must have (or had access at one time) to damn near every cart. I wonder if he was recording such data for each game.

By contrast, the iNES format needs only 'copy /b'. Such a UNIF building tool would be needed to make homebrews, and it would reduce the scope of your app to creating the board spec.

<br />For creation of them, I opted for a simpler approach - I wrote a small program, named <a href="http://qmt.ath.cx/~nes/tools/makeunif10.zip" class="postlink">MakeUNIF</a>, which takes a small textfile and creates a UNIF file based on the parameters inside. For .NES files, I made a similar utility named <a href="http://qmt.ath.cx/~nes/tools/makeines10.zip" class="postlink">MakeINES</a>.

	<tr>
		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I've been throwing around a few ideas on the database specifics. I'm planning on using MySQL for the database. I would prefer to write the client interface as a standalone program as opposed to a web-based one. I use Windows, but if I stick with using strict Win32 API, Linux and such should be capable of running it without trouble (actually I would prefer to use MFC, but AFAIK that pretty much limits it to Windows only). Worst case, if one wanted to contribute, but couldn't use the program, they could pass the details along to me to add on their behalf. Also you could technically connect to the DB using any SQL client you please and add the data manually, but that would be a bit of a hassle.
<br />
<br />As for the specifics of what the DB would contain, I've come up with this preliminary list. Some of it is not absolutely neccesary or even applicable in some cases but I think is useful nonetheless.
<br />
<br />Before each entry, you will have to point to what ROM data your working on. It will allow you to load iNES, UNIF, or raw PRG+CHR. This is so it can calculate CRC data. If you load a UNIF file, it will also pull any other relevant data it can.
<br />
<br />Game Name: 
<br />The full game name
<br />
<br />Board Name:
<br />The complete board name (ex. NES-AOROM-3, NES-NROM-256)
<br />
<br />Hardware Onboard:
<br />Chips on board besides the ROM/RAM/CIC (ex. MMCx,LS161)
<br />
<br />Copyright holder/year:
<br />Game publisher and year released (ex. Nintendo 1987)
<br />
<br />PRG/CHR ROM sizes:
<br />This will be auto-generated
<br />
<br />PRG/CHR CRC:
<br />Auto-gen'd
<br />
<br />VRAM &amp; WRAM Sizes:
<br />Size of said if present, otherwise leave 0.
<br />
<br />Battery:
<br />Flagged if cart contains battery.
<br />
<br />System: (See note later)
<br />What system the cart is intended for. (NTSC,PAL,PC10,VS)
<br />
<br />Country:
<br />Country of origin.
<br />
<br />Mirroring:
<br />Mirroring on cart. (Horz, Vert, Mapper Ctrl'ed, 4 Screen, 1 Screen (there are 2 types of this?))
<br />
<br />Catalog #:
<br />The cat number for the cart (ex. NES-XX-USA)
<br />
<br />ROM Names:
<br />The ID stamped on the ROM(s) (ex. NES-XX-0 PRG)
<br />
<br />Controller Type:
<br />Controller used by game. This one is kinda iffy to me, it doesn't really have anything to do with the cart. Only reasoning for having this one is so an emu could auto-select the proper input device and also as a reference such as ("What games use the zapper?")
<br />
<br />Cart Classification:
<br />This is to ID the type of cart, as in "(Un)Licensed, PD, Proto, Pirate"
<br />Any others?
<br />
<br />The DB would also store your name/date submitted.
<br />
<br />Something else I think would be a rather important item is a "Verified" flag. If all information is complete and you personally dumped the associated ROM data, you would check this off and this would lock the entry from future updates. This would also allow people with carts (and ability to open them) but no dumper, to add entries based on ROMs from elsewhere. Which 99% of the time should be good enough,unless the ROM associated with the entry is a bad/altered dump or a revision.
<br />
<br />Back to the note about the system item. It's my understanding that PC10 games have something like an extra 8K? ROM that contains that menu program that runs on the upper screen. Also the VS Unisystem has the various dip switches. Also they have custom palette ROMs. Do you think there should be means to handle this info?
<br />
<br />Sorry for the long post. To sum it all up, I'm asking for your insight on the interface idea, any items you think should be added/changed etc.

<br />
<br />Hardware on board: NES-EVENT has a DIP switchbank. VS Unisystem has a color ROM. All licensed NES games have a CIC chip; unlicensed games have either a CIC clone (Tengen) or a -5V generator (Camerica, Color Dreams, AVE).
<br />
<br />Copyright owner: What happens when a game is subject to multiple copyrights? Example is NBA Jam. Publisher listed on the box is Acclaim; characters and scenario are licensed from NBA Properties; game design is by Midway; program is by Iguana; some low level code libraries are licensed from Nintendo.
<br />
<br />Cart classification would have to distinguish programs that have one or more of the following: <ul><li>"Pirate" : title screen hacks to remove copyright or change the name of a game, often found on multicarts </li><li>"Graphics Hack" : Mario Baby would be both a pirate and a graphics hack </li><li>"Conversion" : any of the various fighting games based on the TMNT Tournament Fighters engine would be a pirate and a conversion </li><li>"Pirate Original" : game which has an original program but uses copyrighted character likenesses without permission, such as Kart Fighter or Somari or the various ports of Aladdin </li></ul>
<br />Despite the prominence of pdroms.de, I'm rawther not fond of the designation "PD", as its expansion "public domain" implies that all copyright in a work has been abandoned. Some authors give a blanket license to noncommercial distribution of verbatim copies but reserve all other rights under copyright. I'd say "freely redistributable proto" instead.

<br />Alas, don't count on ANYTHING that has Win32  APIs to run well under Linux. Wine is still lagging in most areas. Standard libs and cross over libs are the only way to keep the fustration to a min. 
<br />
<br />Also, if you are going to force users to use something different, then you must at least provide a conversion tool. 
<br />
<br />A great idea though. I am thinking of integrating such a (simpler) DB into my emulator.

I had initially planned on having this work by each submitter would basically be running this program, and create entries that would have to be sent to me or wherever to be merged into a master DB. But I basically I decided it was going to be easier and much more streamlined to use SQL. It's not a matter of performance, just convience all around. As for the DB server, I was intending on just having it run on a local machine off my own connection, since this isn't something that going to put much load on it. The reasons I'm leary of the web interface: While I want it to be as hassle free as possible, I don't want it to be so easy that any old meathead can come and punch in a bunch of garbage. Not that I suspuct that would be much of a problem. Secondly, I'm not a big VB fan, and the only other way I could go about this would be a VB ActiveX control. I'm sure it's possible with PHP and the like, but I am unfamilar with that. Also this way would require me to be running a webserver as well.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">Omega wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">Alas, don't count on ANYTHING that has Win32 APIs to run well under Linux.

<br />Caution: Most residential Internet access terms of service do not permit running a web server, and even if it does you can't turn off your computer or boot it into a different operating system, so you'll probably have to use some sort of shared hosting plan. This costs per year, as the free web hosting packages generally do not support PHP and MySQL.

<br />I'm wondering though, other than boards that have the H/V select pads, mirroring can always be implied by the board name can't it? If so, it seems unnecessary to make that distinction and the [MIRR] block would only be necessary if the board has the solder pads and only have a value for H and V.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />That is correct - the UNIF "MIRR" blocks is <strong>ONLY</strong> relevant if the board (described in the "MAPR" block) has solder pads on it to select hardwired mirroring. Many [non-Nintendo] cartridges are simply hardwired to horizontal or vertical mirroring (in which case the board name would imply it), while there are also a few Nintendo boards (MMC3, possibly MMC1 as well) which have solder pads to select between Horizontal, Vertical, and Mapper-controlled.
<br />
<br />The fact that there are <em>two</em> different "hard-wired single-screen" settings in UNIF is rather stupid, since if it's hard-wired you'll NEVER be able to tell which half you're using.
