Just FYI, if you're ever worried about the status bar tiles taking up valuable CHR space, most decent memory mappers will allow you to swap CHR banks mid-screen. Super Mario Bros. 3 (MMC3) does this with its status bar, as do many RPGs. <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />You can also change some palette colors, but AFAIK this can cause glitches if not done properly.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=935">BMF54123</a> — Mon Sep 19, 2011 1:43 pm</p><hr />

Just a lil post before I head off to say I've tinkered more with the Player 2 palette and after using light brown (which worked fine on wood but made the dragon look like a turd) I've gone a different route and used pink which seems fitting for a girl dragon and looks significantly different to the fire palette so she clearly upgrades.  Also it gives a bit more color to the levels too with the pink gems and flowers and enemies.<br /><br />Because of the new pink some of the things had to be removed from that palette such as the chicken but then it hit me that because of the use of black added from using those dark faraway trees I can swap more things from sprites to background tiles.  For example the chicken is now a tile using the wood/rock browns and has a solid black background which means I can put it anywhere which would be black or mostly black anyways.  Can do the same when I want to add lots of coins as background tiles.<br /><br />Ok I'm gone.  Seeya soon, folks <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /><p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=5006">Carnivac</a> — Mon Sep 19, 2011 1:12 am</p><hr />

The green dragon would turn blue and use ice and the orange one would turn deep red to use fire.  They would be selectable at the start as to which one Player 1 would want to be.  If both are playing then, like LittleBigPlanet, there would be small areas that both players have to co-operate to gain access to and often do it by combining their abilities.  Such as setting fire to a particular obstacle and then using ice to put out the flames and clear the path.  So niether dragon would ever be the same color as each other.   And I didn't waste colors like you say, I needed a sort of orange range for sprites that could be 'woody' or 'rocky' but still needed the red/yellow for fire effects and to me they certainly look different enough to be clearly recognisible while being just similar enough that I can flicker between the two for the flames to give them a nice effect.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">tepples wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"><br />And about palette changes to reflect power-ups: Super Mario Bros. 3 shows the hero's tailed form by changing the shape with the same palette.

As for 'changing the shape' there isn't much room in a 16x16 sprite to do a lot to it and I've no idea what fire or ice powers would do to a dragon's shape that could work in that small an area or make any sense.   <br /><br />I'll have to think about it but I'm pretty busy with training and rehearsals for the next week or two so won't be about much.  By the way that TV-like filtered image seems alright.  I prefer sharp clean pixels (with or without scanlines) but yeah it's nice to see how it might have looked on a real NES plugged into TV.<br /><br />Anyways seeya sometime <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />  Thanks for all the help.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=5006">Carnivac</a> — Sun Sep 18, 2011 1:51 pm</p><hr />

How flickering works:<br /><br /><img src="http://i.imgur.com/mvM6l.gif" alt="Image" /><br /><br />Here's Megaman 2 with a bunch of sprites in the same row.  Everything is flickery.<br /><br />Whenever the NES draws sprites, it takes the first 8 sprites it finds in that scanline, and discards the rest.<br />So the game has to put the sprites in a different order, so a different group of sprites gets discarded instead.  So instead of sprites missing, you get flickering.  This is called "OAM Cycling".<br /><br /><img src="http://i.imgur.com/Yas9Y.gif" alt="Image" /><br /><br />Here it is again in super slow motion, so you can see that sprites are clearly disappearing.<br /><br />If a game has 8 sprites and projectiles, it needs to flicker the sprites so projectiles or sprites don't disappear.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=53">Dwedit</a> — Sun Sep 18, 2011 12:14 pm</p><hr />

Mainly I wanted to see if there was a way I could bring back the fire and ice dragon idea I originally wanted where a power up would give the dragon the fire ability in the same way as Mario (though with more uses such as a quick small fireball, a more concentrated short range flame and it affecting certain things) and also an ice power up used to freeze and shatter things (like freezing an enemy to stand on, or freezing an airborne enemy to have them crashing down, frozen 16x16 enemies turning into a generic ice block with eyes much the way that in Bubble Bobble enemies in a bubble would have visible eyes which I felt added some charm) but the way I had it before, the palettes wouldn't allow a physical sign that the dragons had one or the other.  I've now swiched things about a bit so that the 2nd player dragon is more of an orange and now both can go red/yellow when they obtain a fire power up and also the other sprite palette has now an icy blue scheme so they can turn blue when they have ice power.  Ok the downside of the color switching is that the coins now have a bit of a reddish look but then NES graphics are all about compromise and I think I can get used to them looking like that.<br /><br />Also I added some more edited stuff from past abandoned projects I felt fit well here.

I love the new HUD. You are a really talented artist!<br /><br />My only complaint is the green dragon... I mean, his side of the HUD is not mirrored from the other half, so to me it doesn't make sense to mirror just the dragon, it just causes his right side be cropped by nothing. I think it would look much cooler if he was simply facing right too.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=95">tokumaru</a> — Sat Sep 17, 2011 10:05 am</p><hr />
