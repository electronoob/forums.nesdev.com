Hey, just wanted to let you all know that there is this little NES/Famicom/Pegasus Party in Poland (since the community in Poland is little) each year during summer break (middle of July) simply called <strong>FamiCON</strong> and this year (2018) we will going to have an Anniversary.<br />Yes!<br />It is 10th time in a row since we started this project!<br /><br /><a href="http://mwk1.vot.pl/contrabanda/img/fCON10_teaser01.jpg" class="postlink"><img src="http://mwk1.vot.pl/contrabanda/img/fCON10_teaser01m.jpg" alt="Image" /></a> &lt;&lt; it's just a Teaser Poster <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_cool.gif" alt="8-)" title="Cool" /> <br /><br />We are not a big scene (if you can even call it a scene). We are just a bunch of crazy people super-loved in this console basically since the beginning - at least the beginning in terms of Poland and <em>Fall of the Great Iron Curtain</em> in 1989 - when a semi-shady company <em>Bobmark International Join Venture</em> started to import a kick ass Famiclone called <strong>Pegasus</strong> (similar to its variant - Kega's <em>Ken-Kid</em> in Russia). We are also not good at all at coding, we only have just a few but yet very talented technicians/engineers (such as <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=4898" class="postlink">krzysiobal</a>) and musicians (such as <a href="https://soundcloud.com/milosandchipjockey" class="postlink">Milos &amp; Chip Jockey</a>). BUT we have a BIG hearts for our beloved console and WE ARE awesome in what we do - which is keeping it alive <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_cool.gif" alt="8-)" title="Cool" /> We are <em>ContraBanda.eu</em> team and you can see some of our work at our youtube channel &gt;&gt; <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCMFiejE_fUK-1b_xbFYTaog">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCMFiej ... b_xbFYTaog</a><!-- m --><br /><br /><em>[[  if you are not afraid of Polish language here is a brief look aka a quick preview what are we up to during our convention parties &gt;&gt; <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://youtu.be/bniKAbwhOhU">https://youtu.be/bniKAbwhOhU</a><!-- m -->  ]]</em><br /><br />HOWEVER, despite all that potential we are not able to celebrate this anniversary as fully and properly as a scene should without your help guys.<br />So.<br /><strong>We would like to ask YOU if ANY of you wish to participate in a task to prepare and code a demo for our 10th Anniversary Party this year?</strong> Even a simple one.<br />We can of course provide a music score for the demo in a suitable form - absolutely no problem, but that is all we have...<br />There are absolutely no bottom or top limits. Pick up a mapper of your choice and unleash yourself. NTSC, PAL, whatever you feel comfortable in.<br />All we urge for is that the demo should run on a real hardware so that we could present it at the party.<br />ETA Deadline is yet to be settled, but let say by the end of June/first week of July.<br /><br />What do you all think about it?<br />Is it possible?<br />Can we count on your coding mad skillz?<br />Who knows - maybe it's a perfect opportunity to make something like <em>High Hopes part 2</em>? THAT would be AWESOME! <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_twisted.gif" alt=":twisted:" title="Twisted Evil" /> <br /><br /><strong>Thanks in advance for everyone!</strong><br /><br /><br /><em>edit::</em> btw. have you seen our first intro demo for the first party? no? then here you go, just hang on tight, intense stuff inside, lol &gt;&gt; <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://mwk1.vot.pl/contrabanda/stuff/fCON1_intro.nes">http://mwk1.vot.pl/contrabanda/stuff/fCON1_intro.nes</a><!-- m --><p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=4331">MWK</a> â€” Sat Mar 10, 2018 4:50 pm</p><hr />
