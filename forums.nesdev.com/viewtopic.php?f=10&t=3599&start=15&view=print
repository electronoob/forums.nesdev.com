		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I think I'm still not grasping one important concept.  That is, when does the hit flag (bit 6) of $2002 go OFF.
<br />
<br />The reason I am not grasping this, despite very good responses listed above, is that this piece of code invoked within the NMI works.
<br />
<br />: BIT $2002 
<br />BVS :- 
<br />: BIT $2002 
<br />BVC :- 
<br />
<br />The Overflow flag gets set (BVS)  and I loop again until it is cleared (BVC).
<br />If I am on scanline 32, x position around 240 when sprite #0 is hit (the first loop, bit 6 gets set)
<br />
<br />then does that means my second loop is waiting until the END of the NMI.  Youch!!!
<br />
<br />When I use this code, I can clearly see the screen being split properly, which doesnt jive with the responses I am reading, so I'm pretty sure I am clearly misundertanding what takes place during the second loop.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />The first loop waits for sprite 0 hit to clear (turn off).  This happens at the end of VBlank.
<br />
<br />The second loop actually waits for sprite 0 to hit.
<br />
<br />The reason you need the first loop is because if you try to wait for sprite 0 hit when it's still in VBlank, the flag may still be set from the previous frame -- so you'll get a "false positive" so to speak and will split the screen at the very top instead of mid-frame like you want.
<br />
<br />You seem to be getting BVS and BVC mixed up.  BVS will branch when V (sprite 0 hit flag) is set.  When put in a loop like the ones you're using, that means it will keep looping as long as V is set -- therefore, BVS is really waiting for V to clear -- not waiting for it to become set.

<br />
<br />I was mis-understanding 2 very important things.
<br />
<br />1) I was miunderstanding the branches.  I was mistakenly thinking they were branching forwards, lol.  Thats just me being a fool.
<br />
<br />2) I was misunderstanding thinking that the hit flag was cleared at the time the NMI was fired.  This was a huge mis-understanding on my part, because if I thought it was clear then my first loop wouldnt even have been needed (and obviously it is).
<br />
<br />
<br />The first loop waits until scanline #0 occurs. 
<br />The second loop waits until sprite #0 intersection occurs.
<br />
<br />Got it.  Time to update my code comments <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />
<br />
<br />I really appreciate all the responses.  It greatly clarifies things for me.
