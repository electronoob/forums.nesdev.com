<br />
<br />And no, the these-games-aren't-sold-anymore-but-new-games-should-be-supported argument doesn't hold up. (maybe it would if you're holy enough to either buy or delete every game available on Wii virtual console or the like)
<br />
<br />I have no objections to people trying to make money from a game they've spent late nights coding on, and I can't claim that I myself would be first in line to dump and distribute a NES game if I had made it. But whining about people pirating your precious game only makes you look silly.

<br />
<br />Well, regarding the engine, I still need to get some water mechanics and it's POSSIBLE I might have weapon changes.  Maybe have you shoot a big fireball.  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />  I'm not too worried about water yet as that should only be a jump modification.  (plus nowhere uses it yet)
<br />
<br />Right now, the main focus is enemy creation and level design.  I've got a guy who does some good graphic work and he's made up some nice designs for some future areas.
<br />
<br />I recently implemented some RLE and LZ compression for the room tile data, which will be handy.  I just need to apply it to all the uncompressed rooms eventually...  I wish a C++ program to do it for me would be simple to write...
<br />
<br />I guess if we needed a percent...  I'd say 12-15%

<br />I haven't played I Want to be the Guy but I could understand if that's how it does scrolling and he wants it to be the same.  The demo I'm working on now is meant to be similar to Knytt Stories and it works the same way.
<br />
<br />Additionally I have been playing a lot of NES games lately and the little things really get to me.  A lot of games have annoying little forced slowdowns here and there, and his game is going to be faster and smoother overall without something like Megaman/Zelda edge scrolling.
<br />
<br />Anyway that looks really great, I especially like the way the bricks look at the end.  I haven't seen a lot of homebrew sidescrolling engines.

<br />
<br />Regarding scrolling:  I considered it, but by this phase I don't think it'll happen.  It's another layer of complexity that seems beyond the scope of this project by this point.
<br />
<br />If it's any consolation, the credits screen will scroll upwards.  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I think the non-scrolling aspect kind of adds appeal to it. And besides, I believe he said the screens are individually RLE or LZ compressed, and that would be a nightmare to decode in real time (though I've decoded RLE in real time for an RPG map scroller). But trying to decode between multiple compressed screens when scrolling would be a painful task. Especially considering the presence of a status bar  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /> .
<br />
<br />And the scrolling isn't <em>quite</em> like Zelda's, though it's similar. Well, this one doesn't have scrolling, I guess. In Zelda, the screen scrolls really quickly to the next one. This one just goes screen to screen with no scrolling.
<br />
<br />I actually have a scrolling engine which scrolls all directions (diagonally too). Since I'm using vertical mirroring and no special tricks, I had to make a small status bar out of sprites. A BG status bar I don't think would work without doing really tedious garbage. In Sivak's case, I imagine this would equally suck.

<br />At one point, I was planning to make a platformer that decodes a screen at a time based on some RLE+Markov scheme, yet still scrolls smoothly. I rejected it in favor of a column at a time when I realized I might not be able to fit the decoding, physics, and NPC/monster logic into a single frame.
