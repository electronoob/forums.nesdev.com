In this use they're also known as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decoupling_capacitor" class="postlink">decoupling capacitors</a>.  It solves the problem of having noise in the power supply.  The so-called noise is the state changing inside all the various ICs.  With larger ICs having hundreds of pins, there will be dozens of bypass caps all around the part.  So I was wrong when I said one per IC, it's one for every VCC pin on the IC.  Clearly it's not critical on an NES cart, in the same way it is it is on a faster CPU, FPGA, or something (look on a PC mainboard, they usually have many tiny caps directly under the CPU socket).<br /><br />Kreese:  Because it appears to work, it'd be a waste to use the caps if they really weren't needed.  Small waste, but it would add up.  The NES is well-built and should put out some reasonably clean power, but the exact power requirements are application-specific.  It's possible that they're all fine, if they were all built like that - I imagine there would be a lot of complaints if the games crashed randomly, or depending on the NES's temperature, and so on.<br />  <br />It might be interesting to run an NES with some bypass caps removed, or smaller sized, to simulate failed caps or ones that are in the low end of their allowed tolerance range.<br /><br />You can get ceramic caps up to 10uF that are cheap, small, and surface-mount.  That's what I'll be using to replace that pesky and huge electrolytic cap.  Usually the main power input cap is 4.7uF or 10uF.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=10">Memblers</a> — Mon Jan 17, 2011 4:20 pm</p><hr />

It's not a problem to solder one on the board, but it's a problem to find room for them when designing the board.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=38">Bregalad</a> — Mon Jan 17, 2011 12:54 pm</p><hr />

Wow, there isn't a single capacitor on the board?  I guess there's no surface-mount one on the back?  Every cart I've seen at least hast a 'bulk' capacitor, usually electrolytic 4.7uF-10uF on the power input.  The rule of thumb is a .1uF cap per IC, but it may be overkill to put them all on.  Of course I'm sure you've noticed those things can cost less than a penny each, so it's not like it's expensive kind of overkill, heheh.<br /><br />No, you don't really need it - if it's working on your NES.  It's <em>probably</em> OK in general, but I would want them on there if I was going to use it on different systems or trade/sell it and wanted to be sure.  And yeah, the caps you linked to would be fine.<br /><br />I know Codemasters at least seemed to have put carts out that didn't have any bypass caps.  But I've also heard of one case where one of their games (Fantastic Adventures of Dizzy) was crashing during the intro, but was perfectly fine after bypass caps were added.  But even that cart I'm sure still had a bulk capacitor.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=10">Memblers</a> — Sun Jan 16, 2011 6:57 pm</p><hr />
