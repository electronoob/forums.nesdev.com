<br />
<br />I've been pretty much reading through everything first to get a feel of what to expect.  I tried making a .nes file from day 9:
<br />
<br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://k2pts.home.comcast.net/gbaguy/day9n.htm">http://k2pts.home.comcast.net/gbaguy/day9n.htm</a><!-- m -->
<br />
<br />I can't get this to actually work.  I have everything that is needed (i.e. a sprite, background, and palette), and I'm not sure if the coding is weird or not because of my inexperience at this time.  Is this a good place to get a feel for how coding will be, or is everything else going to not assemble correctly?

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Alright, I went to my local library, and it seems they only have one book on assembly... and it's not directed at the 6502.  It's called Structured Assembly Language by Len Dorfman.  But perhaps it could help me out.  Here's what the table of contents has:
<br />
<br />Part I : Assembly Basics
<br /> 1. EXE and COM File Comparisons
<br /> 2. Macros
<br /> 3. Simulated Extensions to Assembler
<br /> 4. BIOS Video Procedures
<br />
<br />Part II: Adding Structure to Assembly Programs
<br /> 5. Introducing the CHUCK Programming Language
<br /> 6. CHUCK: Subroutines, SWITCH/CASE, Looping
<br /> 7. CHUCK: Conditional Branching
<br /> 8. CHUCK: Mixed-Language Programming
<br />
<br />Part III: Adding Procedures to CHUCK's Library
<br /> 9. Direct Video Access
<br /> 10. Miscellaneous and Cursor Procedures
<br /> 11. String Handling and Code Conversion
<br /> 12. Reading a Text String form the Keyboard
<br /> 13. Disk Drive Procedures
<br /> 14. Window Procedures
<br />
<br />Part IV: Demonstration Programs
<br /> 15. COM Programs Become TSR
<br /> 16. Menu Demonstration
<br /> 17. Wari Demonstration
<br />
<br />I'm not sure what this CHUCK language is, and was wondering if by the table of contents if you guys could tell if it's in a good order, or if this also looks like something I should avoid.  Thanks.

So yeah, I don't think you'd want to read that. I could be wrong, but I don't know. I say if it's not directed to the 6502, or 65c02, don't waste your time. That's just my oppinion.

<br />Both the 6502 books I have, I found on ebay.  "Programming the 6502" by Rodnay Zaks is said to be pretty good, I haven't seen it myself.  But it's on ebay for about $6 total right now, pretty decent price.

<br />Execactly the one with I've started. It's great, and I'd reccomand it to anyone.
<br />
<br />(I actually started with NESASM tutuorial, but I eventually needed to know more about the 6502, because the tutorial does expand on how basically works the PPU/APU rather than the coding itself).
