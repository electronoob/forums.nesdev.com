In the case of CNROM you can safely have 1 (pointless, because that'd be the same as NROM), 2 or 4 CHR-ROM banks.

If you want to have background graphics in one bank, font graphics in another, and display text as the background, you'll have to do a mid-screen bank change, without mixing graphics from two banks on the same scanline.

Since there can only be 8 sprites in a row (any more than that are not displayed), you can't really write much with them.<br /><br />Some games do however have separate tilesets for text, but they use a &quot;trick&quot; that consists in bankswitching CHR-ROM halfway through the rendering of the screen. This is common in RPGs for example, where text boxes use a different tileset from the rest of the screen. This is a bit hard to pull off though, because it requires timed code or sprite 0 hits or mapper IRQs, or even combinations of these.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">I'm not sure of the sizes, how would I check?</div><br />Check the sizes of the CHR files. In windows you can right-click the a file and ask for its properties, then it will tell you the size of the file in bytes. The NES can see 8KB (8192 bytes) of tiles at a time, usually half of this is for the background and half is for sprites (but when using 8x16 sprites the sprites can use tiles from the background side).

I was including one chr was was 4kbs and another from one of your examples which was 8 <img src="./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" /><br />So if I'm using two 4kb chrs I need to use the technique your describing to show them both on the screen at once? Is there any examples of this or can you give me some function names I should take a look at?<br /><br />I guess to explain what I'm doing is making a card for someone special, just a static picture for the background with text below it. The background took up all the space in the first chr that I need another for the text. <br />Here is a pic:<br /><img src="http://s11.postimage.org/kgokjuaen/emulator.jpg?noCache=1353793061" alt="Image" /><br />The white below is where I'd like the text. <br /><br />Thanks for bearing with me, although I am a programmer I'm not to familiar with any of this... I can say I am having fun though <img src="./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" />

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />No, you need to display more tiles, there's many ways, but sprite 0 is the easiest. You do this by changing them as the PPU is rendering. Sprite 0 is a flag on the PPU that when a sprite0 non-zero pixel overlaps another non-zero pixel from the background, it will set the flag, allowing for you to then go and change the graphics used by the PPU in $2000, resulting in having more graphics available for the background. Or you can just change the 4KB graphics page if you're using a mapper, which also works.

The easiest way to detect *when* to make that change is a sprite 0 hit.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">I'm just not sure how to.</div><br />How do you write to the PPU ports in C? The PPU has this control register ($2000) that you can use to configure some aspects of the PPU, one of them being which pattern table is used for backgrounds and which is used for sprites. The idea is that during VBlank (i.e. before rendering starts) you set the background to use the pattern table that contains the picture. Also during VBlank, you position the first sprite (sprite index 0) right below the picture, making sure that a non-transparent pixel in it overlaps a non-transparent pixel in the background (that's the only way the PPU will detect a &quot;hit&quot;). Then you wait for the hit to happen, by reading the PPU status register ($2002) repeatedly until it indicates that a hit has happened. At that point, you make another write to the control register and make the background use the other pattern table, the one that contains the font. Hopefully Shiru will provide details on how to do this in C.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />tokumaru, the whole point of my library is that is high level, so it frees the user from thinking about ports.<br /><br />It is possible to write and read ports by a pointer, though, but as the screen splits are picky to the timings, I think a better idea is to just write a function in assembly code, a simple loop that waits for sprite 0 hit. There is an explaination of how to add an assembly function to C program in my article and in this thread.
