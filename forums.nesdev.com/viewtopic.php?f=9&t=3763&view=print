<br />look at my design draft ^-^
<br />that is for next year's NES project of mine

<br /><img src="./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /> FOR GREAT JUSTICE <img src="./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" />
<br />
<br />i say why start from scratch when i can work off what you guys have already accomplished <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />
<br />plus, you guys would start selling powerpaks and copynesses like hotcakes
<br />
<br />imagine, powerpak + copynes working together seamlessy with the power of the social mutiny for globally remote multi user play <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />
<br />
<br />this makes xband look like crap imo.  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt=":roll:" title="Rolling Eyes" />

<br />Except for the cost, I'm sure.  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_eek.gif" alt=":shock:" title="Shocked" /> 
<br />
<br />I don't get the part about combining game engines.  But I've long thought a multi-cart-slot expansion (if it's software controlled) would be really cool.  2 is not enough of those.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />No offense but this seems like a pretty convoluted dream project. If you want to dump and playback and network, better make your own self contained device that ties everything together. For your idea to work you'd need to vastly rework the PowerPak and CopyNES anyhow.
<br />
<br />CopyNES is really just a PC interface so your shared board part doesn't make any sense, CopyNES needs to be installed into the NES.
<br />
<br />Why do you even need modified ROMs? If you have a self-contained network interface and a NES pad interface, you could relay pad data from each of the player's controllers to eachother's consoles via the internet. If you have a PowerPak with custom network code, consoles could be synced by timing the reset. 
<br />
<br />You could even remove your "Social Mutiny" box by just moving the ethernet module to the PowerPak's FPGA. The NES code could set up the connection and the FPGA could handle the controller relaying.
<br />
<br />You could eliminate the CopyNES too by just adding a single expansion connector and gating the control signals with the FPGA.
<br />
<br />If you directly connected to eachother over the net, you wouldn't need a central server either. 
<br />
<br />This entire project could be housed in a single large cartridge too, except you'll need a patch cables and a connector for the controller ports.

<br />
<br />Shared CopyNES would house Kevtris' FPGA NES he is working on.
<br />
<br />so no need to Frankenstein an actual NES.
<br />
<br />also the Shared CopyNES is not required if you provide your own dump images.
<br />
<br />btw this is for telnet style games, without hacking a system to crap. just hacks the roms to crap.
<br />
<br />
<br />just to make this clear, this is for telnet based massively multiplayer NES carts.

<br />
<br />in reality all you need is your pc, an isp, a single PowerPak, a SM-NXM CF emulation driver + cable for your pc, and a SM-NXM controller 2 telnet driver for your pc in order to play SocialMutiny.tv games. (Plus a NES/Famicom, TV, and controller 1)
<br />
<br />btw did i mention the SM-NXM-CF emulation driver + cable also would work with a digital camera.
<br />
<br />btw did i also forget to mention there will also be an SD version of the cable and driver for use with Wii?
<br />
<br />(Yes, i realize the SM-NXM-SD cable and driver is seemingly pointless for Wii until homebrew boot discs that update using homebrew Wii firmware and real-time SD save file editors come into play. Yes, I am already aware that the save files on SD for the Wii are just encapsulated carbon copies and not actually saved to nor loaded from during gameplay.)

<br />
<br />Now may we please get back on topic as to my planned NES Development related products for Spring 2008?
<br />
<br />Now to answer your question, atari2600a, and to ignore your 'retarded' comments from now on:
<br />
<br />Planned Social Mutiny Product line for Spring 2008:
<br />
<br />Parts Legend:
<br />SM = Social Mutiny
<br />-
<br />XC= eXpansion Cable
<br />-
<br />CF = Compact Flash
<br />S4021 = Strobe 4021
<br />SD = San Disk
<br />
<br />Drivers Legend:
<br />x86 = Intel/AMD x86
<br />PPC = Apple/Mac PPC
<br />SMJ = Sun Micro-Systems Java
<br />MVJ = Microsoft Visual J
<br />
<br />SM-XC-CF + SM-XC-CF Driver [x86|PPC|SMJ]
<br />SM-XC-S4021 + SM-XC-S4021 Driver [x86|PPC|SMJ]
<br />SM-XC-SD + SM-XC-SD Driver [x86|PPC|SMJ]
<br />
<br />No, I will not write drivers for non-Intel/AMD x86 or non-PPC. If you want a driver outside those bounds you will have to make do using the Java driver, or write your own.
<br />
<br />The drivers for the SM-XC-*'s i have listed above in this post will be open source just as the components and construction methods I use will also be open information.
<br />
<br />However, the Social Mutiny Ram Drive software for the CF and SD models will be closed source until possibly as early as Summer 2008.
<br />
<br />btw info on the NES Controller's Strobe 4021 can be found <a href="http://www.diylive.net/index.php/2006/02/03/decoding-nes-controller/" class="postlink">here</a>.

You may want to actually explain what all this stuff you're babbling about is because it sounds like you're just making random things up on the spot which is very confusing.
<br />
<br />You bought pre-made boards from "Apache Reclamation", OK... what are they?
<br />
<br />What do you mean by telnet style games? Like MUDs? If you're not talking about terminal games, what does telnet have to do with anything?
<br />
<br />What are you talking about when you say hack ROMs to crap? Are you going to be hacking the ROMs? And for what?
<br />
<br />When you say massively multiplayer NES carts, you mean more than 2 player that the games were intended for?
<br />
<br />Do you have any prior experience programming NES or designing hardware?
<br />
<br />Why should anyone not ignore this thread?

<br />
<br />The CF cable will allow you to do things like ram drive the contents of the Compact Flash card inside the PowerPak using your own computer.
<br />
<br />The SD cable will do the same thing as the CF cable, except for San Disk. This will allow you to toy with the Wii for example, somehow or another, or toy with future PowerPaks or look-alikes that optionally use San Disk instead.
<br />
<br />Once the PowerPak, or PokerPak look-alike, is able to use either savestate or savedata to the card in real time, you can ram drive the contents of an emulated SD or CF card in real time, and sync the Strobe cable to either Controller port 1, 2, or both, using that data with your computer.
<br />
<br />You can then use a 3rd party homebrew application to do the handshaking server-side between the computers hooked to each NES/Famicom.
<br />
<br />Thus 2+ player gaming via globally remote NES/Famicoms will easily be feasible with this method with the release of this portion of the Social Mutiny product line-up by Spring 2008 (hopefully), using completely unmodified PowerPaks and NES/Famicoms.
<br />
<br />Disclaimer 1: You would only have to buy the main Social Mutiny unit, if you don't own a computer, all the main unit is, is a custom computer for the sole task of allowing you to use the cables, drivers, and 3rd party software in the first place if you lack a computer. The main unit may never be put to production, but if it were, would simply be a small desktop computer case containing the minimum required hardware orderable prebuilt possibly by ThinkGeek.com as a custom box order with most, if not all, funds going directly to <a href="http://thinkgeek.com/" class="postlink">ThinkGeek.com</a>. Possibly, if this pans out, I will make arrangements with ThinkGeek for handling the custom construction and sale of middle range and optimal range prebuilt Social Mutiny main unit computers in addition at a later date.
<br />
<br />Disclaimer 2: The Social Mutiny 'Shared CopyNES' will possibly never be put to use, as Kevtris vowed never to allow a CopyNES to fall into my hands for some reason or another, despite my ideas put forth upon him to make a multiple  cartridge slot version using the FPGA NES he is working on currently, of which even holds true to the quirks of the actual NES and Famicom systems.
