<br />
<br />I believe the prerender scanline makes the same triple-fetch that other scanlines do, so I'd hypothesize that the MMC5 looks for the first triple-fetch to see when the PPU starts rendering.
<br />
<br />The only other way to triple-fetch an address (aside from how the PPU naturally does it) is to do it intentionally, by writing the same address to 2006 three times (reading from 2007 each time), so it seems plausible to me. It'd even be easy to implement the in-frame flag this way; whenever the scanline counter is clocked, set the in-frame flag.
<br />
<br />That's how it could detect the <em>start</em> of a frame, but how it detects the <em>end</em> of a frame is beyond me. Krzysiobal's earlier post mentioned that he watches for a read from CPU$FFFA, which would happen when the vblank NMI happens. Right now, I'd be most willing to wager on that being how the MMC5 does it. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" />
<br />
<br />This is all just speculation though. I don't have the same amount of free time I did when I first made this thread, otherwise I'd be more gung-ho about testing things. :\

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Yes, the thread I didn't think it was serious was the "OMG I invented the MMC7" one, not <em>this</em> thread.
<br />
<br />I guess I'd had to say "I didn't think <strong><em>that</em></strong> thread ..." instead of "<strong>this</strong> thread" to be more precise - in french (my language) we only have a single word for "this" and "that" so it's hard for me to know which one to pick when I'm writing in english.
<br />
<br />When it comes to deteting the end of the frame, wouldn't it be as simple as counting 240 scanlines ? Of course it you enable rendering late (Battletoads style) it will not work, but who ever said the MMC5 counter worked properly in this setting ?
<br />
<br />Detecting reads from $fffa can be clever, but it will only work if NMI is enabled. We all agree it's almost always the case, but you could decide for some reason not to always use NMIs, and then this would make the MMC5 counter fail as well ?
<br />
<br />I think there is at least a NROM game, Portopia, which relies entirely on $2002 pooling and never uses NMI. This game hardly uses any animations so randomly missing VBlanks has no visible effects on the game.
<br />
<br />Anyways this should be extremely simple to test by reading $fffa manually. If the MMC5 however looks for a $fffa read followed by a $fffb read on the next cycle we can't do that with code so we'd have to test this by disabling NMIs and see if the counter still works or if it's stuck in its "in frame" state.

<br />
<br />If it watches for CHR RD to settle down, then the in-frame flag should go low before the NMI fires, because there's supposedly an idle scanline before the PPU actually sends the NMI.
<br />
<br />Also, continually alternating between reading 2007 and 5204 would hypothetically cause the in-frame to stay high (since reading 2007 would generate activity on CHR RD), even when it's supposed to be low.
<br />
<br />Again, speculation, but easily testable. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" />

<br />Just wanted to add portuguese to the list: it also has 3 in theory (este/esta, esse/essa, aquele/aquela) but "este" is hardly used in spoken form, where "esse" is used in both cases.

The fetches at x=337 and x=339 of one line have the same address as the fetches at x=1 of the next line.<br /><br />Now we just need to figure out how to do the same thing with fewer I/Os. I'd bet just watching for several consecutive reads with bit 13 set ($2000-$3FFF) would do it. The most consecutive fetches you get from $2000-$3FFF during a scanline is two, and the end of a scanline has four: x=337, x=339, x=1, x=3.<br /></div>
<br />
<br />Did some probing around with my logic analyzer to try and prove the validity of your idea Tepples.  It might be even easier that that, I'll have to test this at some point but it appears that a simple flipflop could sense scanlines if the timing was properly established.
<br />
<br />Watching the CHR A13 line you see the four consecutive reads like you discussed.  Below the blue trace is CHR A12 where you can see the sprite fetches for the scanline.  Yellow is CHR /RD, Red is CHR A13, and Green is CHR /WR (not much to see).  This is coming from the intro of "To the Earth" for anyone curious.
<br />
<br /><img src="https://dl.dropbox.com/u/18341918/B_ca12%20Y_chrRD%20R_ca13.jpg" alt="Image" />
<br />
<br />But looking at the traces above one other thing sticks out.  CHR A13 and CHR /RD always rise WITH eachother, but there's ONE exception.  Between scanlines CHR A13 falls low for a small period of time, and when it rises again for the 3rd read CHR /RD has 'hung' for that same period of time.  So it almost looks like you could just have a counter that was allowed to be clocked when CHR /RD was high and then clocked with CHR A13.  This looks like a great solution with the above discrete traces.  In actuality CHR A13 lags CHR /RD slightly as expected, which wouldn't allow the idea above to work if the logic was reasonably fast.  One way to get around that would be to add some extra delay to CHR /RD with a few gates or something.  I wouldn't expect this to be to stable, just thought it was interesting how CHR A13 toggling could be taken advantage of.
<br />
<br />Your idea to merely check for 4 consecutive writes seems pretty sound.  You could even reduce the counting logic from 3 to 2 bits and just check for 3 consecutive reads I'd think.  The IRQ's would be delayed compared to MMC3 but you'd loose the mess of goofing things up with $2006/7 only using TWO inputs.
