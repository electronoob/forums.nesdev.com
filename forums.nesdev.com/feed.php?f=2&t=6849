Well, I'm not even sure if my current method is any good, it basically goes like this:<br />The platform and player keep their Y-position of the previous frame in memory. If their collision boxes overlap, it is checked whether the player was above the platform in the previous frame. If so, he's ejected upward and the "standing on ground" flag is set.<br /><br />It is a very dumbed down version of what I originally had in mind since it only handles landing on top of a platform.<br /><br />Before that I've been trying to come up with code that checks for collisions on all sides (like SMB seems to do for its platforms) which always resulted in a buggy mess.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=1377">miau</a> — Sat Aug 28, 2010 3:34 am</p><hr />

Alright, I whipped up some C code to test my ideas.<br /><br />This doesn't have all of the features I talked about, yet, but it's simple and the collision detection should be pretty fast when converted to 6502 ASM. Currently, the platforms behave like Item-1, 2 and 3 in Mega Man 2. You can stand on them, but also move through them from below.<br /><br /><a href="http://morphcat.de/crap/collision_src.zip" class="postlink">Here's the source</a> (uses Allegro) and <a href="http://morphcat.de/crap/collision_win32.zip" class="postlink">here's a Windows binary</a>. Maybe it will be of use to someone someday.<br /><br />For now that's all I need, so I'll leave it at that and get back to it when solid objects become a necessity.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=1377">miau</a> — Wed Aug 25, 2010 9:30 am</p><hr />

I haven't implemented this yet, but what I plan to do in order to move the player along with the platform he's standing on is this:<br /><br />A variable indicates if the player is standing on another object (it will be set when the player and the object collide and the player is on top) and which object it is (an index that points to one of the active objects). Using that I can read from the object's memory how much it moved last time (in absolute pixels - objects that can be stood on have to calculate this and put the result in a specific location) and change the absolute position of the player by the same amount.<br /><br />That sounds simple enough, and shouldn't screw up the physics because accelerations and speeds are not modified at all.<br /><br />I'll get back to you on collisions, 'cause I have to go out now.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=95">tokumaru</a> — Mon Aug 16, 2010 6:22 am</p><hr />

A few days ago I decided to add support for moving platforms to my platformer engine.<br />However, my brain is having a hard time coming up with an implementation that's fast and doesn't cause all kinds of havoc.<br /><br />By moving platform I mean any object that is "solid" and movable within the game world, e.g. blocks that can be kicked or thrown etc, enemies that can be used as platforms like in SMB2 or Gimmick.<br /><br /><br /><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">I - Collision detection between platforms and sprites</span></strong><br />I'm not entirely sure how to handle this efficiently, yet. Code for checking whether two sprites' collision boxes overlap is already available and it's quite fast. Moving platforms would basically be sprites that require more advanced collision checks than that.<br /><br /><br /><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">II - What happens if a sprite is standing on a moving platform?</span></strong><br />There are two ways I can think of to handle this.<br /><br />First of all, the following is done once per frame.<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">update_position:<br />sprite_x = sprite_x + sprite_xspeed <br />bgcollision_check_horz&#40;&#41; //checking for background collision, ejecting the sprite if it's in a solid tile<br />sprite_y = sprite_y + sprite_yspeed<br />bgcollision_check_vert&#40;&#41; //same, but for vertical movement</div><br /><br /><strong>Method A</strong><ul>Change update_position to:<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">sprite_x = sprite_x + sprite_xspeed<br />sprite_x = sprite_x + platform_xspeed<br />bgcollision_check_horz&#40;&#41;<br />sprite_y = sprite_y + sprite_yspeed<br />sprite_y = sprite_y + platform_yspeed<br />bgcollision_check_vert&#40;&#41;</div><br />Unfortunately, now sprite_xspeed and sprite_yspeed don't reflect the sprite's absolute movement speed anymore. E.g. background collision will be broken since it uses sprite_yspeed to decide whether the sprite should be ejected upward or downward.<br /><br />To solve this issue we separate the different kinds of movement speed and add them together before running the original, unaltered update_position.<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">sprite_xspeed = platform_xspeed + sprite_xspeed_rest<br />sprite_yspeed = platform_yspeed + sprite_yspeed_rest</div><br />That's 2 or 4 additional bytes of RAM per sprite depending on if you use 8-bit (like Super Mario Bros. 3/Super Mario World) or 16-bit speed values (like my engine currently does).</ul><br /><strong>Method B</strong><ul>Changes of platform speed affect sprite speed directly.<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">speed_add&#40;xchange,ychange&#41; //platform speed should only be changed using this function<br />&#123;<br />   platform_xspeed = platform_xspeed + xchange<br />   platform_yspeed = platform_yspeed + ychange<br />   if&#40;sprite_standing_on_platform&#41; &#123;<br />      sprite_xspeed = sprite_xspeed + xchange<br />      sprite_yspeed = sprite_yspeed + ychange<br />   &#125;<br />&#125;<br /><br />speed_add&#40;3,0&#41; //increase platform's x speed by 3</div><br />This method is slow because of all the checks needed, setting platform speed to an absolute value would require even more awkward calculations while sprite speed cannot be set to an absolute value at all without breaking everything(?). Yup, now that I've written all of this down I realize it's not a good method at all. It just feels a bit closer to the real world where the car, elevator or whatever moves YOU (in b4 "tepples: But in Soviet Russia..."). <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" /><br /></ul><br /><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">III - What happens if a sprite is pushed into a solid tile by a platform?</span></strong><br />Haven't given much thought to this, yet, but here's how I'd attempt it:<br /><ul>- the background collision code ejects the sprite and sets flags on where the collision occured (up, down, left or right side of the sprite)<br />- if one of these flags is set, either...<br /><ul>- the platform won't try to push/eject the sprite into that direction anymore (platform can move through sprite, boring)<br />or...<br />- platform should stop movement in that direction and "rest" on the sprite (multiple objects could be stacked if done properly, interesting!)</ul></ul><br /><br /><br />So... am I on the right track? Are there any other pitfalls that I am not aware of?<br />How do you handle this kind of stuff / how do commercial games do it?<br />Any kind of input is appreciated.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=1377">miau</a> — Mon Aug 16, 2010 5:54 am</p><hr />
