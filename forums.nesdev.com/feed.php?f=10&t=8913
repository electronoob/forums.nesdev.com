<title type="html"><![CDATA[A question about programming AM29F032B chips]]></title>

<content type="html" xml:base="http://forums.nesdev.com/viewtopic.php?t=8913&amp;p=94107#p94107"><![CDATA[
I have a MiniPro Universal Programmer (model TL866CS) which has been quite a good programmer compared to the Willem I had years ago but I recently wanted to get into doing SNES reproductions and the method that seemed the best and most cost effective was using M29F032 TSOP chips with the type III conversion boards from buyicnow. The programmer has an adapter that is capable of doing AM29FXXX chips so I bought the adapter, bought the chips and the boards, a whole box of donors and all that stuff only to find that the MiniPro software doesn't seem to do AM29F032 as a selectable option, though it does have AM29F080 and 016 as one.<br /><br />Is anyone familiar with this programmer or its software that know a workaround to this, I know with some software you can add new chip types to it but I don't know how to do this or if it is even possible with MiniPro. It is a shame too because the MiniPro is a fantastic and fast programmer with a huge support list for not a lot of money and can work on even windows 7 machines.<br /><br />The software can be found at <br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.autoelectric.cn/minipro/MinProUpdate.htm">http://www.autoelectric.cn/minipro/MinProUpdate.htm</a><!-- m --><br />if anyone can take a look at it (page is in Chinese).<br /><br />If there is no workaround can anyone recommend an inexpensive USB programmer that will work with AM29f032b chips that also works with windows XP?<br /><br />Thank you in advance.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=5303">pyrexsteel</a> â€” Sat May 19, 2012 2:08 pm</p><hr />
