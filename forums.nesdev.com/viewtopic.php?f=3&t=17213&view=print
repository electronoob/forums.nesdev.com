Note how huge the PAL/SECAM zone is. Compare it to which countries the NES/Famicom console was sold in.<br />en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_Nintendo_Entertainment_System#Going_international_(1984-1987)<br /><br />You will notice that most of the world has never seen official NES/Famicom release. That led to pirated clones of this console being sold all over Eurasia in early 90's.<br /><br /><a href="http://e.huawei.com/en/videos/global/older/hw_206603" class="postlink">A Taiwanese hardware manufacturer</a>, <a href="http://txccrystal.com/index.html" class="postlink">TXC Corporation</a>, developed a device compatible with Famicom and with PAL/SECAM signal at the same time. They called it <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Micro_Genius" class="postlink">Micro Genius,</a> and it was sold under different names all over Eurasia, where no PAL NES or Famicom was sold.<br /><br />In Russia it was sold as Dendy, and by that name it was <a href="https://wiki.nesdev.com/w/index.php/Clock_rate" class="postlink">recognized by the emulation scene</a>, because it was Russian enthusiasts <em>(one of them you can see right above this post)</em> who studied how Dendy operates and how it differs from official consoles, and they convinced several emulator authors to add Dendy mode, in addition to NTSC and PAL. In most emulators it's called Dendy mode, but in fact it was a Hybrid mode technically speaking: NTSC games working on a PAL console, and Dendy wasn't the console this mode originated from, Micro Genius was.<br /><br />Most of the time pirates were simply ripping off NES and Famicom games, occasionally adding cheats to them, sometimes breaking them by this. Some games were developed for PAL Famiclones from scratch, but it's not easy to find them (TXC themselves <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Micro_Genius#List_of_games" class="postlink">developed some of them</a>). And finally, there were ports of other consoles games to this platform.<br /><br />One of the developer teams doing such ports was <a href="http://bootleggames.wikia.com/wiki/Hummer_Team" class="postlink">Hummer Team</a>. There is a HUGE article about its history, in Russian, called <a href="http://emulate.su/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/DF_Mag_7.pdf" class="postlink">Hummer Team: все, что вы хотели знать о главных пиратах</a>.<br /><br />Right now I have no info on whether such bootleg games were sold outside Micro Genius area. Since they were perfectly compatible with Famicom, there is a high chance they were sold in Japan. But carts such games were released on are incompatible with NES, and PAL NES timings were incompatible with those of Micro Genius. Considering that even official PAL NES wasn't very popular in Europe, bootleg games had vanishingly little chance to ever exist on the PAL NES market.<br /><br />This leaves us with a conclusion that bootleg games made by Asian developers for Micro Genius market were basically only spread within that market, with little possible exception of appearing in official NES/Famicom area.

What I mean is a 50 Hz PPU with 312 scanlines that starts the NMI at scanline 291. Games that &quot;need&quot; Dendy timing use screen splits timed according to an 21-scanlines-long NMI period, but have an NMI handler that sometimes takes more than 262 lines and thus will freeze on a regular NTSC console because the next NMI is raised when the previous has not finished yet, for example when massaging level data.

Because this happened to my country in that map, I don't know how accurate it is for all other countries.<br /><br />BTW, I find it really amusing how pirates found a better way to make a PAL version of the NES/Famicom than Nintendo itself. I don't know if Nintendo intentionally made the PAL NES more different from the original than needed, as a form of region-locking, but judging by the many poor conversions that were made for the European market, I'm pretty sure that developers would've benefitted from better compatibility between the two systems.
