<br />Itll load it up, and use the following options: (Dumping Operation Wolf this time)

<br />Dump Cart
<br />Nintendo:  less common mappers 
<br />NES-SL1ROM (which is what this one is, opened it and looked)
<br />Hit OK
<br />Pick the name of the file (owolf)

<br />Itll get to:

<br />Initalizing parallel port...
<br />Resetting CopyNES...
<br />Unloading any existing plugin...
<br />Resetting CopyNES...
<br />Loading plugin...
<br />Running plugin...

<br />then itll sit there for about 20 seconds, and I get this error

<br />
<br />This happened with Tecmo NBA Basketball, and Super Mario 3 as well.  
<br />
<br />Any insight on why this is going on?  Thanks!

<br />
<br />Plugged in Fully
<br />
<br />And I had to format, and it has not worked since.  Its a NetMos 9805 card (ya had added the option to manually put in the address a while back) because my card would not let you use lpt's...it was set to other, and A800 before (AC00 only works now)
<br />
<br />But it does it on every game I have tried
<br />
<br />
<br />I was hoping our past conversations would help, but they havent (refering to link below)

<br />
<br />I tried every setting combo possible with the card, and it still wont work....Also purchased a new cable, still didnt work.
<br />
<br />I tried on LPT1 with options 
<br />
<br />"Try not to use an interrupt"
<br />"Never use an interrupt"
<br />and
<br />"Use any interrupt assigned to the port"
<br />
<br />Tried all those on LPT1/LPT2/LPT3 (same with copynes and used "other" as well), and also tried all of those with "Enable Legacy PnP detection"
<br />
<br />
<br />Any clues?? 
<br />
<br />I could get it to detect a bios, could stop/start the game via the software too

Maybe other cables running in parallel with it can cause interference sometimes. I'm using the 6' cable kevtris supplied, a shorter one or better sheilded one may be less prone to it.

<br />I don't know if this helps any, but I have a NetMOS 9715 and it quit working when I stopped using win98.  Can you be sure the pport is working at all?
<br />
<br />I wish mine would work again, it's annoying having to power down the PC to switch between devices.

<br />XP Pro on both.  Tried with SP1 and SP2 as well.  Also tried erasing the bios chip and burning it back on with the one included with the copynes software, and still the exact same problem.

<br />
<br />Yeah, I dunno why people were having trouble with the 6522's... this is the second one I heard of.  After the first one, I started testing every 6522 to make sure it worked;  I had 1 other that didn't work on the last batch I tested, so I don't know what's up with that.
<br />
<br />Jameco seems to be about the only place where I can get those chips these days and theirs are all pulls supposidly, though lately they seem to be brand new chips;  clean, angled leads (like on new chips) and apparently unused.  Out of those, I have had no failures.
<br />
<br />The other option is it could be static zapping the chips thru the parallel port when it's connected to the computer.  If there's a voltage difference between the PC and the copyNES when it's plugged in, there is a chance it could zap the port chip.  Unfortunately, there's not much in the way of protection on the data lines.
<br />
<br />When I sell out of the copyNES boards, I may redesign it with some robust protection on the port pins, as well as a driver so it can handle 3.3V parallel ports as well as it handles 5V ones.
