<br />
<br /><a href="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/36237540/2009_11_27_paltest_mine.png" class="postlink">http://dl.dropbox.com/u/36237540/2009_11_27_paltest_mine.png</a>
<br />
<br />Here is what the correct output should look like (running on NEStopia):
<br />
<br /><a href="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/36237540/2009_11_27_paltest_good.png" class="postlink">http://dl.dropbox.com/u/36237540/2009_11_27_paltest_good.png</a>
<br />
<br />It seems that in my emulator the far left column of colors is being displayed for all 4 columns.  I could probably fix this but the problem is I don't know what the 4 different columns are supposed to represent  (brightness levels?) or how they translate to the PPU hardware.
<br />
<br />I know someone has the answer...I just hope it's not too obvious or I'm gonna feel really silly.  LOL
<br />
<br />THANKS!! <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />

<br />Edit: Fixed links.

<br />I don't know what could be wrong in your emulator... it seems to be displaying only color 0. Can you verify that the Name Table has been correctly written to and that the scroll is properly set to display it?

<br />
<br />Anyone have some insight into exactly how loopy generates his output palette in his paltest ROM?  Is he using some obscure PPU feature to get his ROM to work?  If so, then I probably just don't have it implemented yet. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />

During rendering it modifies that one palette to display different sets of 4 colors every few scanlines.<br /><br />Your emulator only displaying color 0 leads me to believe that there's something wrong with the set up of the background (meaning that the 4 columns don't get drawn) or with the scroll (which would cause the wrong Name Table, the one without the stripes, to be displayed). This is why I asked you to check the contents of the Name Tables (check if the stripes are even there - they use tiles $00, $01, $02 and $03) and to check if the scroll is being properly reset to the start of the NT that contains the stripes.<br /><br />Another thing you don't seem to be emulating is the fact than when rendering is off and the VRAM address points to the palette area, the PPU draws the color being pointed, not color 0 as it normally does when rendering is off. If you look at the correct output you can see that the 4 colors of the previous section are briefly displayed as the palette is rewritten.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">Is he using some obscure PPU feature to get his ROM to work?</div>
<br />I haven't seen anything "obscure" about it, but it does rewrite the palette and resets the scroll several times during rendering, which is not a common thing in games.
<br />
<br />EDIT: Don't take this the wrong way, but the source code is distributed with the program, it's very short, and since you are writing an emulator you *should* have enough knowledge of how the NES works to debug this.

<br />No offense taken.  I will look at the source code - I just thought there might be something really simple to fix since quietust's palette test was working perfectly.

In fact, since I don't know how far along your emulator is, it's kinda hard to debug this. Maybe there is something among the basic things that you haven't implemented yet (attribute tables, maybe? setting the scroll through $2006? it could be a number of things), and since you know what's implemented and what isn't, you might have a better clue of where the problem is than I do. It could even be a CPU bug. Are you sure your CPU is 100%? If it isn't it might be failing during the loop that draws the tiles and they don't get properly drawn.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">since quietust's palette test was working perfectly.</div>
<br />As I usually say, there are a million different ways to do the exact same task. The final effect of displaying the palette can be accomplished in many ways, Quietust just happened to use a particular set of features you have already made accurate enough.
<br />
<br />Blargg also made a palette demo, that even shows all combinations of color emphasis in action, but it wouldn't work in your emu because it relies on the PPU displaying the color pointed by the VRAM address (which you just said you haven't implemented yet).

<br />
<br />Tokumaru, you used the term "rendering is off" twice.  I think you meant to use "rendering is on" the first time.  Is that correct?

<br />When rendering is on, $3F00 is always the "fill" color (if sprite and BG pixels are transparent, then $3F00 is used)
<br />
<br />When rendering is OFF, then $3F00 is the fill color <em>unless</em> the PPU address is pointed to somewhere in pallet memory.  In which case, whatever the PPU address is pointing to is the fill color.

<br />Ho ho ho!  This might answer a question I've had for many years, as a result of working on FF2j/FF2e for Demiforce.  Square would set the PPU address to $3F00 using $2006, and then immediately set it to $0000 again.  Let me see if I can find the code snippets in my work folder...

<br />
<br />Hmm... I have lots of questions about this.
<br />
<br />Not to hijack the thread for my own use, but -- is there anyone willing to sit down with me online (IRC, Live/MSN, AIM, Yahoo, ICQ, whatever) to assist me with actually fixing what's broken in my FF2e intro?  *looks complacently at Disch*  :-)
<br />
<br />I'm almost certain it's something to do with the $3F00/0000 stuff, in addition to resetting $2005 to $0000 (which I still don't understand, re: loopy's scrolling skinny).  The intro works fine on (most) emulators, but what happens on an actual NES is different; someone once recorded me a video of it, so I know exactly what it looks like.  I do have a ROM image that exhibits (visually) on emulators the exact same problem as the NES, so I'd be more than happy to send someone that as a test.  The issue only happens when the text fades in/out, indicating the issue is probably within my palette fade routine.
<br />
<br />Please let me know, either privately or in this thread.

Why hasn't anyone talked to me about it?  Yes, I'm incredibly hard to find, aren't I?  *sigh*<br /><br /><a href="http://www.romhacking.net/trans/139/" class="postlink">http://www.romhacking.net/trans/139/</a> mentions nothing of the problem, and the only reference I can find is <a href="http://www.romhacking.net/hacks/453/" class="postlink">here</a>.  Quoting the readme:<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">The patch for Final Fantasy 2 also fixes the intro so that it work on real hardware (it orininally had glitches in the intro), and make sure the mapper is effectively MMC1 not mapper 2 (it shouldn't hurt if it already way MMC1), because a mapper 2 hack distribution was (and still is) very common, and it's not possible to make a cart out of it. For this reason, it's not recommended applying the PAL fix patch before the english translation because it's not likely to work. But it should work with other translations in various european languages based on this english translation as well (there is plenty of them).<br /></div><br /><br />Your fix/patch is highly focused on re-working Square's code to work on PAL consoles, with the "added bonus" of "fixing my intro".<br /><br />EDIT: I did find another fix-up of some sort <a href="http://www.romhacking.net/hacks/149/" class="postlink">here</a>, released in 2006.  I don't know who Parasyte is or what was truly changed, other than what the readme says (which includes other changes as well).  I haven't looked at the IPS to work out the differences between what Demi released and what the patched version does.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">Bregalad wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">The error was that you did writes to $2006 without writing a correct value to $2000, and the wrong nametable was shown when plalette fading, because only $2005 was reset. Another error was that you used $2002 polls to wait VBlank instead of using the reliable NMI waiting routine.</div>
<br />
<br />Let's expand on this, because none of the above helps me to the extent that it should.
<br />
<br />1) People seem to be intentionally forgetting that this intro was written in late 1997.  That means it was based on what the community (that included me at the time) knew 12 years ago.  Getting all in-my-face in 2008 is a little ironic, given that the console itself is from 1985 to begin with.  :-)
<br />
<br />2) You sound outright annoyed by my request; I read what you write and it gets translated into "tons of people have already fixed your fucked up code, you don't know shit, go away".  If I'm interpreting that correctly, wonderful -- I don't even know what to say to that, because I've already been down this road with the nesdev community in the past many times over.
<br />
<br />3) Since when do you have to write to $2000 before writing to $2006?  None of my intro code writes to $2000, and why should it?  I have a feeling this circles back to bits #1/#0 of the register (Name Table selection), but again, see Item #1.  Please expand on this.  Point me to thorough documentation.  I wouldn't ask for help if I knew what the problem was.
<br />
<br />4) Regarding "only $2005 was reset" -- same comment as #3.  This very likely relates to loopy's "skinny on NES scrolling", which further complicates matters.  I think I've already stated on this forum a few times now that all the explanations are highly cryptic and that something concise/easy to understand/examples needs to be written before people will truly understand such PPU details.  I'll also point out Item #1 again, which is when none of this information was available.
<br />
<br />5) Regarding polling $2002 for VBlank status -- yep, I do that, specifically monitoring D7 (VBlank status).  The code in question therefore becomes something like this:
<br />
<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">-&nbsp; &nbsp;LDA $2002<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; BPL -<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; LDA #$3F<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; STA $2006<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; LDA #$09<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; STA $2006<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; ...further palette modifications &#40;writes to $2007&#41;...<br /></div>
<br />
<br />Can you expand on what's wrong with this?
<br />
<br />The reason I wrote what I did was because I did not want to have to re-write Square's NMI routine -- given that VBlank lasts a certain number of cycles, I didn't want to risk screwing up their routine and making a mess of the actual game itself.  It's difficult enough working with cramped ROM space to begin with.
<br />
<br />I can see some mistakes based on what Disch has said in the past, specifically setting $2006 to whatever address first, then writing $0000 to $2005.  I say "mistakes" because I think the order you write to the registers affects how the PPU behaves internally (circling back to loopy's skinny on the PPU again, causing me to point out Item #1 again...)
