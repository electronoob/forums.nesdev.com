*double checks*<br /><br />Yeah,  I suppose it is oblique projection. (shrug)<br /><br />Regardless, it's there, it's free, and it uses around 9 tiles.  (some of the tiles in the sample's bottom are not used in the sample. they are included for "finishing series" when put next to solid colors, or for use with combining with another tile using a logical AND, such as against a sky tile.)<br /><br />It's just something different from the stock 2D platformer (megaman, Mario), or Zelda-Like overhead flat projections.<br /><br />For completeness, I need to make "archway", "Door", and "steps" tiles though. Might do that tomorrow.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=4301">Wierd_w</a> — Thu Mar 25, 2010 4:05 am</p><hr />

<content type="html" xml:base="http://forums.nesdev.com/viewtopic.php?t=6827&amp;p=58845#p58845"><![CDATA[
Here is a quick set of 16x24 "Jacket Man" tiles I started working on for Wombatguy on the IRC channel.<br /><br />Here they are so far in both brown and grey versions.<br /><br />*replaced with PNG versions, per req.<br /><br /><br /><img src="http://i186.photobucket.com/albums/x248/wierdw/brownjacket-1.png" alt="Image" /><br /><br /><img src="http://i186.photobucket.com/albums/x248/wierdw/Greyjacket.png" alt="Image" /><br /><br />These are simple 3 color sprite sets. To get the most out of the color palette, I reused the hair color as the highlight color for the jacket and pants, which limits how these sprites can be colored, but I still think they look OK. (considering the limitations.)<br /><br />I haven't tested the animations yet, but there is a run/walk, a "Crouch", "Pant/heave", and a "Punch" animation in the set.<br /><br />There are some "eye-less" frames, since wombat guy wanted some kind of "idle" animation.  I might add 2 more frames for the crouch, so that in the fully crouched condition he continues to "breathe", but I'll leave that up to wombat guy if he likes what I have so far.<br /><br />If anybody else wants some sprites, I am available on weekends. Stop by the IRC channel, and drop me a line. I work second shift, so I get up late in the afternoon CST.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=4301">Wierd_w</a> — Mon Mar 22, 2010 8:42 pm</p><hr />

You know, I would actually find it fun and entertaining if someone gave me graphics that they made for me to improve upon. That way I wouldn't feel like it's that much work, and it would be easy/relaxing to do something like that. Maybe that's a better thing to do than asking an artist to make graphics from scratch for you.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=138">Celius</a> — Tue Jan 12, 2010 11:22 pm</p><hr />

In order to be as generic as possible, I think a public domain barebones graphic set should include:<br /><br />Solid block<br />Ladder<br />Semisolid block (i.e. ones you can jump through and land on top)<br />Harmful block (i.e. spikes)<br />Collectible A (i.e. coins)<br />Collectible B (i.e. keys)<br />Collectible C (i.e. powerups)<br />1-up<br />Door (the most generic "goal" I can think of)<br />Up, Down, Left, Right Arrows<br />Fontface (Numbers and uppercase letters as a bare minimum)<br /><br />That's for BG anyway. Let me think up some sprites...<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=21">Drag</a> — Tue Jan 12, 2010 8:32 pm</p><hr />
