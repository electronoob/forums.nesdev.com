Just to verify - the original clock input to the MMC3 was the (21.47727M / 12) clock correct?  Or was it the raw 21.47727 clock?  If it was the faster clock then I could see how it could detect rising edges of A12 _within_ a CPU cycle.  But if the MMC3 clock was the CPU div-12 clock then they must have been doing some fancy analog circuitry stuff in order to detect edges that is not possible for me to do in my FPGA.  *However*, I do have a way around this - I will work on it and get back to you.</div>
<br />The PPU [CHR A12] pin is what MMC3 is watching, not the CPU [PRG A12] pin.  The cartridge doesn't get any kind of "clock" input.  The cartridge simply counts rising A12 edges.  If I understand correctly [and this certainly may not be the case as I have currently broken my own MMC3 implementation trying to make it PPU-cycle accurate], A12 can rise up to 42 times in a single scanline (if BG and Sprites are at $1000).  The rising A12 occurs on PPU cycles [scanline relative] 4, 12, 20, ... [for BG], 260, 268, ... [for Sprites].
<br />
<br />BG @ $0000, Sprites @ $0000 - 0 A12 rises per scanline, no IRQ clocking
<br />BG @ $0000, Sprites @ $1000 - 8 A12 rises per scanline, 1 IRQ clock
<br />BG @ $1000, Sprites @ $1000 - 42 A12 rises per scanline (the additional come from the garbage fetches after the sprite fetches], 1 IRQ clock
<br />
<br />I'm hoping that my reply helps both you and I as I have to think through this also to get my emu back to passing Blargg's tests.

<br />I used them to get some sanity checks on my verilog core, which I think is mostly bug-free now (for the documented instructions at least). Since you're on an fpga, I highly suggest rigging up a serial port connected to some unused portion of the address space. It will be invaluable.

<br />According to the pinout the MMC3 mapper does get the PHI2 clock input.  I'm not sure what it would do without one.
<br />
<br />
<br />I like your explanation on the A12 rises.  Every little bit of info helps with MMC3!!

<br />I honestly don't have any idea what you're talking about here but I think that's simply because I don't know anything about this CPU test environment.
<br />
<br />Thanks for the info!

<br />Another point of confusion is I've found documentation referring to A13 as the pin that MMC3 monitors.  This one does reliably toggle 42 times per scanline no matter where BG/Sprites are located.
<br />
<br />So which is it...I think of A12 as $1000.  A13 as $2000.  A0 = $0001.

<br />It is most definitely A12 assuming bits are numbered starting with 0.  So that would be $1000 as you say.

<br />I thought so since obviously Blargg's test roms check $1000 and I [used to] pass them until I embarked on an scanline IRQ accuracy reorganization.  [I wasn't passing the MMC3 timing test and I think it has to do with where in the frame I raised IRQ -- I used to raise it right after cycle 256 and get "happened too early" fault.  Seems I should be raising it on 260.]
<br />
<br />But...the dreaded 0/1-based monster always lurks in my mind and refuses to let me believe A12 is always what I think of as A12.
<br />
<br />I mean...A13 makes more sense, doesn't it?  Why did they use A12 which toggles dependent on BG/Sprite organization, when A13 toggles *always* 42 times per scanline, no matter what.
<br />
<br />$2000 - nametable fetch
<br />$23C0 - attribute table fetch
<br />$0000 - pattern fetch
<br />$0008 - pattern fetch
<br />$2001 - nametable fetch
<br />$23C0 - ...
<br />
<br />Boggles the mind.

<br />I can think of two reasons: For one thing, it saves a few gates compared to a divide-by-42 counter. For another, Nintendo might have been planning to change the memory access pattern of a future major version of NES PPU, such as an expansion from 8 to 16 sprite slivers removing the dummy nametable fetches. Remember that the Super NES was originally supposed to be backward-compatible.

<br />
<br />Makes sense.
<br />
<br />Update: Got my MMC3 IRQ handling rearchitected [I pass PPU cycle and address to the mapper classes for every PPU access; the mapper class ignores any rising edge within 8 PPU cycles of a prior one, runs IRQ count logic otherwise] so now I'm passing all tests except for the A and B variant tests.  It feels good to have an implementation that possibly matches the 'real thing'.  
<br />
<br />On the way I found that I was passing the test roms ok, but SMB3 wasn't firing IRQs at *all*.  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_eek.gif" alt=":shock:" title="Shocked" />  I had read somewhere that all unused sprite pattern fetches are from pattern index $FF, so I had hard-coded $0FF0 as the address to fetch these pattern slices from.  Well, SMB3 uses 8x16 sprites which means the address for the fetches should be $1FF0, not $0FF0.  This obviously then causes an IRQ on cycle 260 of a sprite-less scanline.  Once I fixed that then SMB3 and the test ROMs all work.

<br />
<br />I think I may have found at least one bug in my A12 counting.  One problem that I see is that A12 is also toggling when the PPU accesses the mirrored region of the Name/Attribute Tables (e.g. $3000).  I know that the name/attr table ram is an external chip on the board so obviously the external A12 bit on the PPU would toggle.  So wouldn't the mapper also see A12 toggle at that time as well?  At this point my mapper is counting those toggles too.
