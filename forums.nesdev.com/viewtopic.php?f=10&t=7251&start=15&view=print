<br />As for $B2, it's not entirely silliness. NESASM was based on an assembler for TG16, which has a 65C02 family CPU. This also shows up in NESASM's preference for the 8 KiB bank size of MMC3-class mappers, which matches that of the TG16.

<br />Well, it is silliness if the program is named <strong>NES</strong>ASM. No matter what it's based on, it shouldn't generate instructions the NES doesn't understand. Does NESASM also accept BRA? STZ?

I guess it's time to get bunnyboy to add a command line switch to choose NES mode (6502 + "this is illegal you know" unofficial opcodes like SAX + iNES header) or PCE mode (65C02 + Hu6280 extra opcodes like SMB3 + whatever header PCE uses if any).<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">Does NESASM also accept BRA?</div>
<br />Nintendo wouldn't have back in the "Seal of Quality" era. (Oh wait, that's bra, not BRA.) I wonder if SMB3 still works.

<br />
<br />
<br />And yeah, I agree, I don't mind not having labels and other features assemblers have because I am comfortable with NESASM, but it's also this stuff that scares me too. This is the first time I've seen it do this and now I don't want to use it because without doubt, I don't want bad binarys full of stuff I didn't intend to happen. I'll learn a new assembler over having a bug that shouldn't happen because of the assembler. If he fixes it I might switch back, but until then, I guess I have to find a new assembler. Oh well. I don't want to, but now maybe having + and - branches will make it worth it? ^_^

<br />Anyone tell Bunny of this yet?

<br />
<br />Sorry to sound like The Grinch, but:
<br />
<br />Become more familiar with the tools you use.  Questions like "why doesn't the tool do what I'm hoping it will do?" (effectively that is the question being asked in the OP) are, and I do mean this sincerely, completely silly.
<br />
<br />I'm not sure what it's going to take for people to actually sit down and read the documentation that's associated with the tools they use.  If the tool doesn't come with any documentation, don't use it -- yes really.  I wouldn't trust any low-level tool (that includes assemblers) which doesn't come with documentation outlining syntax, macros, and other functionalities.
<br />
<br />There's a reason I recommend asm6 to people these days, and it's because the syntax matches what those of us "old timers" are used to, meaning it's what you'll find used in most books, 6502 tutorials, and so on.  But ultimately every assembler is different.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I'd say that is kind of iffy. I mean I would very well expect my C++ compiler to make basic optimizations and so I expected the same out of NESASM. I'd never seen anything in the documentation about it so I figured it was one of those trivial little things that the compiler takes care of, but I was feeling frisky and as it turns out it does not support zero-page unless directed by the user. Its not so much a lack of documentation as it is poor documentation but in the end, I didn't pay for it so its not all that big of a deal.
