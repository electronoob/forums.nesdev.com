<br />I only have good things to say about them. They're easy to unsolder, only a few pins to swap (or none if you use eproms). It didn't took me that much time to make them compare to the mess of the MMC3 that I did yesterday that was hell to unsolder and so many pins to swap. 
<br />
<br />Can't wait to experiment with them. Now I need to figure out how to make music for the VCR7. I will need to check if PMCK can do it.
<br />
<br />If some people when to test some VRC6/7 code on the real hardware some day, I can test them now.

<br />
<br />I've never had a VRC7 cart, or any non-clone FC stuff for that matter, so I've never really known.  Plus that MML was from 5 years ago, many winamp plugin updates ago.  If there is any info about the instruments from kevtris and Quietust, I'd believe it to be accurate.
<br />
<br />I'm more impressed with FM chips now than I was when they were more common.  I know in DOSBox, it doesn't sound exactly like my old OPL3.

<br />
<br />Good to know.  I checked very fast a website that talked on how to use PPMCK and it seems that you can export to a nes file directly.
<br />
<br />If I have any issue, now I know who to ask <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />  By the way, did you make any songs with the VRC-VII?
<br />
<br />Edit: 
<br />
<br />Compiled the MML with PPMCK and asked to make a nes file but the sound doesn't work in emulator.  I guess more work will be required to test it on the real hardware then.

As in - all channels can use a custom instrument at the same time, but then it'll be the same instrument for all channels, since only algorithm 0 can be customized. It's a shame they didn't pick a slightly better chip, like the YM3526. But it should still be possible to make some cool tunes with the VRC7 (though N106 still has the lead ;)

My guess is that I need to init the mapper properly if I want to use it.  Once I figure that one out, I should be able to test those NSF on the real thing.

<br />
<br />No problem. But first I need to figure out the contradiction with the wiki (which is down at the moment, again) with what I saw in the rom for mirroring, the proper init sequence (if any) and why does it need to do a loop 8 time for nothing after writing/init to the sound registers.. Small break from my main project, if I can figure it out <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Double post again, my bad.
<br />
<br />I was able to make a sample with my current test code that can play the NSF file on the VRC7 and show some content.  For now, I was able to only play Memblers song: <a href="http://membler-industries.com/banshaku/memblers_Guardic_gaiden.mp3" class="postlink">Memblers - Guardic Gaiden</a>
<br />
<br />In general, the sound is very close or almost the same to what we have in current emulators.  The only issue is that the sound sometime goes wild: the sound change on every reset, sometime fine, sometime not or break randomly during play. This could be caused by the driver that doesn't init properly or some quirk about the hardware that we are not aware about (there must be a reason that they didn't make that much game with this sound chip after all...).
<br />
<br />~J-@D!~: For now, I'm not able to make your files run in an emulator either because of size or just doesn't work.  Once I can make something comes out, I will see if I can record it. There is good chances that the sound could be distorted like Memblers's one.  PPMCK nes files doesn't work for VRC7 (the quick test I did) so I have no choice but to include the nsf file directly in my own test sample. That's a pain since I have to test 1 file at a time.
<br />
<br />I will need to find a file host if I record other MP3 since I don't think my provider will like if I put too many mp3 on it (and I'm limited in size too).
<br />
<br />I could always post the sample I used for playing the NSF but since it use some part of my test code for showing my meta-metatile, it kind of a little bit complicated and maybe have less value because of that.   I didn't saw any code sample for VRC7 but for now it doesn't differ much from other mappers usage.
<br />
<br />Edit: 
<br />
<br />Updated file link, location only changed.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Thanks for recording that.  It sounds very cool, though it is definitely glitching out.  Actually I do recall that the VRC7 support in the MCK version I used (whatever it was) seemed to be hacked on top of the N106 support.
<br />
<br />What's very interesting to me here, is that I also hacked MCK, replacing N106 with support for my Squeedo synth (possibly based on the same code?).  But there were glitches in it that were suspiciously similar to the mp3 and what you described.  I looked all over my code for the problem, on the NES and PIC18F, but never really suspected it could be somewhere in MCK..!!  This was the first test: <a href="http://www.parodius.com/~memblers/nes/squeedo/samps/007.mp3" class="postlink">http://www.parodius.com/~memblers/nes/squeedo/samps/007.mp3</a>
<br />
<br />If you don't mind using ftp, I have another host with nothing else on it yet.  I could create an account for it there.  You could use MP3, WAV, FLAC (lossless), any size should be alright.
