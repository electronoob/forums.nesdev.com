I don't think there are many games that touch VRAM from active display. You still get 16 or 18 bytes per line and could use that to transfer some/all of the sprite list during a statusbar etc.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">ccovell wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"><strong>Blue's Journey</strong> on any Neo-Geo and double-check that the borders around text during the introduction or in-game are all visible.  That's 320 pixels.</div><br />Unfortunately I don't have that game (and it seems way out my budget too), I only have the Metal Slugs, Neo Turf Masters and Riding Hero and none of those do more than 304 no matter what I tried. My TV shows almost all the image from sync to sync with only few pixels worth clipped off on left side in the porch so it isn't a matter of me not seeing the pixels if they were there, plus I had scope running simultaneously and it never showed any activity at the edges of regular active display area when I was testing around.<br />EDIT: When I looked through my chat log with Furrtek I saw that I did manage to get some noise show up in the sides of screen when I toyed around with some control signals but there was never any actual graphics there. <br />I'll remain unconvinced about the 320 pixels until I see them myself. I don't plan to take up NG programming yet and I'm not very familiar with the machine to write a small test ROM anyway that would set up things so that in theory there will be stuff visible at the sides. I could swap out the 68K program ROM in one of my carts for sake of testing.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Yeah, I thought it was well known the Neo Geo outputs 320 pixels horizontally, but that 8 pixels on either side are commonly blackened out by plain black tiles in the fix layer? It'd be no different than putting a plain black window on both sides of the screen on the SNES or any other thing to block part of the screen in software (Not natively supporting reducing the rendering area, like on the NES).

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Perhaps the smaller res (304x224) was more compatible with marginal monitors, particularly aging MVS monitors and the TVs used with the AES.<br /><br />If you compare the AES's output timing to that of a standard TV, you find that only 315x240 pixels are in the 4:3 frame, the rest in what Rec. 601 calls the &quot;nominal analog blanking&quot; area. (The AES pixel aspect ratio is 65:64.) Assuming 3.5% overscan on all sides, you end up with close to 64/65*.93*320 by .93*240 = 293x223 visible.
