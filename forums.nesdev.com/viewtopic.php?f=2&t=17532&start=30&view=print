They’d change title on context. So, the 8th button would be labeled MATH. if you push it, you then set x id (buttons now labeled 0-F), then y id (same), then operation to be carried out between them (OR, AND, XOR, ADD and so on).<br /><br />D-pad = cursor<br />A = confirm<br />B = go back a step and erase<br /><br />Sel + A or B = step forward or backward without editing<br />Sel + d-pad = move edit cursor freely. <em>// remember to update the soft key readout contextually/accordingly. <br /></em><br />Start = takes us to a menu from where you load, save and run programs and change file metadata like emulation speed, if possible. <br /><br /><br />edit: you could perhaps let the player use 2nd controller for user defined hotkeys. maybe initialized as <br />the most common opcodes used as per frequency count in public domain games. <br /><br />edit2: you can speed up this input procedure even more by predicting likely followup instructions, and set the cursor to the corresponding soft button after one opcode is completed. For example, a chip-8 branch instruction (which always increases PC by an absolute 2 if taken) will mostly be followed by a jump or jump to subroutine, so in a LUT, it makes sense to let all branch cells point the cursor to jump. Other follow-up predictions can be derived from a frequency analysis of pairs in the freely available chip-8 library, just like how we can sort the frequency of the most used single opcodes. <br /><br />An analogy is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Letter_frequency" class="postlink">letter frequency analysis</a>. A <a href="http://homepages.math.uic.edu/~leon/mcs425-s08/handouts/char_freq2.pdf" class="postlink">table of (opcode) pairs</a> where one axis represents the first of the two could then be frequency sorted in order to generate the LUT to be used.<br /><br />I suppose cursor positions for X and Y register ID:s are well enough predicted to often be the same or neighboring ID:s, which also makes the editor simple in this respect. Just keep the last used x and y ID:s in RAM.<br /><br />edit3:<br />sel + start = toggle insert mode editing

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Perhaps instructions' cycle counts in the original interpreter for RCA 1802 might inform roughly how long we have for each instruction in an interpreter on NES or Game Boy, including sprite blits, though we probably don't need to be anywhere near cycle accurate. Is that interpreter archived anywhere accessible?

There are <em>always</em> a lot more interesting ideas around than there are capable developers to implement them. If you're hoping to get a wish, you need to wish for something a <em>lot</em> smaller than this project.

There's actually very little NES-specific stuff involved... once you figure out the screen drawing and input, the rest is basically pure 6502 logic.<br /><br />Ditch the crazy RAM layout though, there's no way that'll work. OAM isn't even a full 256 bytes you can use, since the unused bits of the sprite attribute bytes aren't even stored.
