On the NES there is a problem with IRQ and NMI, indeed - well, if one wants to prevent them, he can use a macro that will disable it before getting into endless loop. Of course this method in general is inferior to emulator-supported breakpoint triggers, but could help in some situations nevertheless.

<br />Log, not step. It's a last resort, though.  I would try the breakpoint testing first, though.
<br />
<br />But, a giant TXT file is created with all the instructions that were run, and you browse that. You can do it with the Trace logger of FCEUX. Log to file. Get the debugger stopped at your reset address. Click start logging on the trace logger. Click run on the debugger. Let it run a couple of frames. Stop logging. 
<br />
<br />It'll still be trouble getting to the end of loops, but you can page down or use your text editor's scroll bar. 
<br />
<br />I would ctrl+f $2007 in the log, and see what's being written (if anything). If you can see this code being run, and it updates, I honestly have no idea what's going on. One thing that may be worth trying is either disabling NMI interrupts before writing to $2006, (remember to re enable them), or bit $2002 before writing to $2006. 
<br />
<br />One other question, do you see your palettes in FCEUX's PPU viewer?

<br />Well after doing this I have two ideas.  
<br />
<br />1.) What does <span style="color: orange">LDA $C3EC,X @ $C3EC = #$00</span> the = #$00 mean?  Does that matter?  Sometimes it makes some sense... but lots of times it is just #$00.  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_confused.gif" alt=":?" title="Confused" />

<br />That's true for memory (RAM at $0000-$07FF or $6000-$7FFF, or ROM at $8000-$FFFF). But it's not always true for memory-mapped ports where reading has a side effect or ports that can't be read, such as most PPU and APU ports.

<br />That's what being written, and what you should pay attention to. I personally ignore the "= whatever" in most cases. It doesn't help when I load. Whatever was loaded is in A in the next row. It also doesn't help when I store. Because I know what I stored, it's in one of the registers, and listed in that column.

<br />Edit: I guess it helps for bit test, and bitwise instructions, but that's pretty rare.
