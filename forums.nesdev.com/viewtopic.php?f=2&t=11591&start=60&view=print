		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />The GBC was much more amicable than the DMG to processing voice samples in Sound 3 (its wavetable) thanks to its double-speed mode (takes 1/2 the time to generate and update wavetable entries). Perfect Dark and Army Men II make great examples of it. Just about every sound effect in PD seems to use it (gunshots, footsteps, voiced dialog), but Rare always seemed to push the limits of whatever system it used. Except for voice samples that did not need tight timing (or when nothing else is going on) I do not recall Sound 3 being frequently used on the DMG for detailed, synthesized sounds. As mentioned above, Pokemon Yellow is the only one I can think of off the top of my head. If any one else has DMG examples, I would love to hear more about them <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />

One of the components starves the SID of power (or vice versa), which might explain that sound.</div><br /><br />No, what I was referring to is that there is no per-channel volume control. Each channel has an ADSR, but this envelope always goes to full volume. There is a global volume control that will fade all three channels at once, and there is a filter which can be applied to any of the channels but it only has global settings, not per-channel (it also had poor consistency across machines, many composers avoided it because of this). As such, there is no easy way to make one channel quiet while another is loud. This is part of the reason why the triangle is more sparingly used on SID, it doesn't compete with the pulse or saw very well. Another trick is to release a note before the attack has finished, which can make a non-sustaining note that doesn't go to full volume. It's a limited technique, but it's enough to have a little bit of volume control. Of course, the ADSR is also fickle and sometime fails.<br /><br />So, ultimately every way of trying to get per-channel volume on the SID is a bit of a pain. Use the dull timbre of triangle for &quot;quiet&quot; parts. Use the filter to make something quiet, and pray it works on most machines. Abuse the ADSR, usable only without sustain, and sometimes it will fail anyway and produce erratic loud notes. etc.<br /><br /><br />The parasitic power thing was merely a constant bias on the amplifier that (unintentionally) would let you use the global volume control as a 4-bit DAC under full CPU control. When they revised the SID, though, they used an amplifier with a much smaller bias, so it made things using this trick extremely quiet. So, this was fairly well known, and doesn't really have to do with making music on the chip. Mostly it was used for stuff like speech samples.

Looked at a YouTube playthrough and I immediately saw what you were talking about. Impressive that you could still move around while the sample plays. There is no hit detection while it plays though? That'd save a lot of cycles necessary for it. Glad you brought that to my attention; it looks technically interesting at any rate.

At the final boss, the heart does not start beating until the sample ends, and notice how the player does that surprised look, also right after the sample plays.  If it was beating while the player got there, it probably would stop beating to play the sample, and then resume.

They don't quite sound like square waves, but what else could they be?<br /></div><br /><br />It's basically an LFSR with a short period before it repeats, similar to the NES 'periodic noise'.  POKEY chip uses that method too, I like it's sound.  It was mentioned the POKEY has 8-bit frequency control, but it also has a combined mode where you only have 2 channels with 16-bit frequency.  Atari must have liked it pretty well too, at one point they were making quad-core versions of it.  I bought a cheap, broke-down Millipede arcade game, at first I was like WTF when I saw that it uses 2 POKEYs.  It seems like every enemy type has a sound channel dedicated to it, and it's actually useful when the game starts getting intense.<br /><br />Another sound chip that uses type of synthesis was in the Atari Lynx.  It's LFSR, but for each channel it lets you select the taps and seed value, and I think that is a really cool idea.  But I've played some Lynx games (not a lot of them), and I've only ever heard the music use square waves and noise.

I don't remember, but it was like, setting attack and decay to 0, and the sustain level to your volume. After that, whenever you wanted to change the volume, you had to send a key off and immediately a key on again.<br />At least I know I managed to pull that trick to completion back when I did some C64 experiments.
