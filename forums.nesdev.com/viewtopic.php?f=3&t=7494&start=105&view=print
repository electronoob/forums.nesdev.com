<br />
<br />You responded before I could edit, but I was going to give ease of future validation as the reason tools control distributors and not vice versa. But then I realized, according to my spec, emulators wouldn't play the files either. So there is truly no way unverifiable, broken roms would get distributed.
<br />
<br />So if I understand what it is you're saying, you'd go out of spec for the folders because you don't think it would affect distribution. And you'd be right because it would be the least used variant. God that's underhanded.

If I have a ZapFC game and change one byte, it is no longer valid, so I would need other tools.</div><br />But only the <em>authors</em> of hacks would need such tools: extract the .prg and .chr from the pristine ROM and the .ines from the database, make the hack, and then make and distribute a patch against the .prg and .chr files. I think the idea is that the <em>end user</em> of a hack obtains the pristine ROM in ZapFC format and then uses in-emulator IPS support to patch the PRG or CHR at runtime.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"><div class="quotetitle">FitzRoy wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">If bad headers is the problem you are trying to fix then ignoring/replacing the file headers is far easier than a new file format that is incomplete by design.</div><br />That's like saying the NES emulator itself is incomplete by design because it will never emulate clone systems. Define what the NES is as it pertains to preservation. Can you do that for me? Does it include toasters and calculators? What is NES hardware? Everything in the world or something more exclusive?</div><br />NES emulators are expected to run games from the original NES console.  Your idea rejects hundreds (thousands?) of those games that were released during the NES era.  It also rejects all homebrew games being created now.  That is what makes your idea incomplete by design.</div><br />Emulators would continue to support iNES. They would also support zipped .prg+.chr+.ines, and they would support zipped .prg+chr without .ines for games that are on someone's canonical list of good headers. FitzRoy would make the list of North American NES games with the Official Nintendo Seal. Someone else would make the list of Famicom games using Nintendo boards or from publishers that were licensed in North America (e.g. Konami), and someone else would make the list of North American NES games from the well-known unlicensed publishers (Tengen, Color Dreams, Camerica, AVE).<br /><br />FitzRoy's big problem appears to be that the proposal for switching from the iNES container to split PRG and CHR in a PKZIP container and the proposal for <em>allowing</em> games with the Official Nintendo Seal to be distributed without the header have been conflated into a single proposal.

<br />
<br />Sorta yeah, but there is no source release for the PowerPak, so I would still have to implement file unzipping by myself (if the NES could even do it with all available WRAM).  And for absolutely no benefit at all to the user (compression doesn't matter for something this small, these aren't floppy disks), I surely wouldn't waste my time on that.

<br />I'm just curious.  Why write such a one-time use tool as a GUI?  This would be ~20 lines or less in perl or python, or ~40 lines of ANSI-C as a command line app that just takes takes filenames in argv[].  Let the shell expand the wildcard glob for you (well, in Windows you still have to do that yourself, but its pretty trivial, 10 lines of code using the win32 api).  A gui app w/ drag + drop seems like overkill to me.
<br />
<br />I'm not trying to pick a fight / flamewar.  I'm just curious about why a GUI app.

<br />I don't think he meant to make a GUI application, since you can drag files and drop them on command line application EXEs, which causes the dropped files to be passed as parameters.
