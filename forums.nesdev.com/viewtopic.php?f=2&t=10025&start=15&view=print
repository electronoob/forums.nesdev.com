My custom score saving system is stored within SRAM, as well as some of player 2's in-game piece &amp; controller functions.<br /><br />During my searches and fixes, i was slowly getting various functions back up and running, but then i came across that if you obtain a high score, the name entry screen was bypassed, and you were unable to write your name.<br /><br />I already had a write of 80 to $A001 within the HW bank, which enables SRAM. But for some bizzare reason, i've had to add that same code throughout the rom, before every write within the region of $6000-$7FFF.<br /><br />So what i wil do, is just paste the things that i added/changed from my notes.<br /><br />Force WRAM At End Of Bankswap Routine, Wipe Out WRAM At CHR Routine<br />$FE2D = EAEAEAEAEA<br />$FF27 = A980 8D01A0<br />OK! Scores Appear!

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Tried this on a real cart tonight and the player 2 controls are working now. Player 2 pieces are also working but I think there may be a bug where p2 does not get the piece shown as next. I can't figure out what the condition is for that, or even if it's happening for sure. Might just be my short attention span. Anyway, the big issues from the first patch seem to be sorted out. <br /><br />In the 2 player modes, is clearing multiple lines supposed to bump up the other player's field? I was expecting that would happen with this patch for some reason- maybe just confusing that behavior with a different version.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />No I dont believe you're seeing things.<br /><br />Ive tried very hard to create a separate NEXT piece for p2.<br /><br />Originaly in the hidden 2p mode, both players go for one NEXT piece. Whichever players piece lands/completes first, obtains the NEXT piece. <br /><br />It was difficult trying to keep my code from glitching. I thought I finally figured it out, but I guess not.<br /><br />As for the random block appearances for the opposing player, I think I removed that back in my first initial release.
