		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I don't like antivirus programs anymore. AVG or Avira doesn't seem to matter, they both keep blocking things that's clearly not viruses or other malware and lately they started to scan my own programs I made myself whenever I compile. This greatly increases testing time as I need to wait for the stupid antivirus to check the programs I made my self (sometimes from scratch) and I'm sure I didn't made them with any bad intentions. Talk about insulting! I don't need protection from myself!<br /><br />Now I'm making a game in C++ and Avira keeps scanning my compiled program every single time I compile it and with its heuristic search it even sometimes detects &quot;malware behaviour&quot; and then blocks the file so I can't run it or test it. It said it was put into quarantine but it's not even there when I check! Not only is this beyond insulting it's also straight out lying!!<br /><br />I put the file and directory under the list of exceptions but Avira doesn't seem to care about that list at all. The only thing I can do is change the name of the output file, but that only lasts until the next time Avira decides that I'm making viruses.<br /><br />Have anyone else experienced similar things? What should I do? Is there any better free Antivirus programs that actually do what you tell it to do?

I have no problems on the Linux side, only this Windows antivirus nonsense. Maybe I'll just go with Windows Defender for a while. Or see if AVG is any better at the moment...

If I need to do something potentially dangerous, like visiting shady websites, installing/running dubious software or software I only need to use once and don't want its left overs in my system, I use a virtual machine. If all goes well for a while inside the virtual machine but using the virtual machine feels inconvenient (for performance or any other reason), I install the thing on the real machine.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Both AVG and Avira have saved me many times in the past from unexpected viruses, they used to be very good and fast (better than many antivirus programs that you had to pay for like Norton). I didn't get half as much adware as I used to and you could add exceptions to false positives. Nowadays they don't care what I put in the exception lists, they decide for me what's dangerous and don't allow me to interfere even if it's just &quot;potential malware&quot; (programs that could technically be used for bad things by the user) or something that the heuristics decided looks like &quot;malware behaviour&quot;, plus they seems to be unnecessarily bloated. I don't like not having full control of my own computer (one reason I like Linux).<br /><br />I do use ad-blockers but I'm not comfortable in the idea of not using an anti-virus at all. I guess Windows Defender may be good enough nowadays though. Good, free open source alternatives seems to be scarce.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />You could turn off the heuristics detection while you're testing your code (just remember to turn it back on after you're done). <br /><br />AV software has to be constantly reevaluated. What was good a few years ago might not be good today. There's a few independent sites that test and rate AV software. I usually check AV-Test.org. Windows Defender for Windows 10 (I don't know what OS you're on), in the months of November and December, had a MUCH higher rate of false positives than AVG or Avira.<br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://www.av-test.org/en/antivirus/home-windows/">https://www.av-test.org/en/antivirus/home-windows/</a><!-- m -->

It does seem to falsely trig on software written in Processing attempting to read files, which requires a case-for-case exception, but else it has been fine.
