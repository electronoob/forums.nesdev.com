Hmm I don't think I've ever used that chipset before, so I couldn't tell you from experience if it should work or not <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_neutral.gif" alt=":|" title="Neutral" /><p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=158">BootGod</a> — Tue Jun 19, 2007 8:55 pm</p><hr />

I don't recall the exact model (and the original packaging is buried somewhere or thrown away), but I do know that my motherboard has a SiS 648 chipset. The parallel port is part of the "Super I/O" section of that chipset, according to the BIOS, which I think is pretty standard for modern boards (no one uses discrete components any more for this). It's running a Pentium 4 Willamette 1.8GHz @ 2.4GHz.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=110">Josh</a> — Tue Jun 19, 2007 7:08 pm</p><hr />

Yeah you basically have to take the whole damn thing apart to detach the copynes pcb :/ The 6522 is socketed, so if you have one around it'd be an easy thing to check.<br /><br />Do you happen the know the motherboard model in your PC?<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=158">BootGod</a> — Tue Jun 19, 2007 6:48 pm</p><hr />

I had some trouble with it before it was packed away, but I wrote that off to problems with the DOS client. No, I haven't used it on this computer before.<br /><br />I opened the case and checked the ribbon cable going from the board to the DB-25 connector; it seemed solid. Getting to the board itself would require removing the cartridge connector. (Incidentally, I replaced that with a new MCM connector right before having it modded, so there shouldn't be any problems on that front.)<br /><br />I have no idea why the 6522 would have blown out. I suppose if it was that, I could pull one from a 1541 floppy drive, or just buy one on-line for a couple of bucks. Is it socketed, though? I don't really feel like doing soldering on the board.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=110">Josh</a> — Tue Jun 19, 2007 6:01 pm</p><hr />

That sucks to hear :/ My CopyNES has started to act a little flakey the past couple weeks as well. What seems to fix it for me is re-seating the copynes board or just playing with it. If you have the top off, you can get your fingers underneath the copynes board and play with it a little.<br /><br />The DB-25 cable can be fussy too, try and make sure it doesn't run along with other cords, it must be a shielding issue. This usually won't cause it to stop working completely though, more so it just causes random stalls during dumping.<br /><br />Did your unit work before you put it in storage? If so, are you using it with the same PC as before?<br /><br />Also, from what I've heard (and I had one like this as well), the port chip (6522 i think) has been DOA. If you happen to have a C64 disk drive around, you could pull one out and try replacing the copnes one with it.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=158">BootGod</a> — Tue Jun 19, 2007 5:24 pm</p><hr />

I took my CopyNES out of storage to try to see if I could dump some Famicom and NES cartridges with it. Unfortunately, when I use the Test function in Bootgod's software, it can't establish communication. I did have the CopyNES turned on during the test, and I am using the original DB-25 cable provided by Kevin. I tried all four parallel port settings in the BIOS (SPP, EPP, ECP, EPP+ECP) and none of them worked. What is the next step in troubleshooting?<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=110">Josh</a> — Mon Jun 18, 2007 11:29 pm</p><hr />
