You can even use GCC as your compiler.</div>
<br />I have been coding for both the Sega Mega Drive and the SNES. From my experience I can tell you that coding on the Mega Drive is much much easier. Finding documentation about programming the hardware is also much easier for the MD than the SNES. The Mega Drive uses the 68000 processor, which is extremely popular and used in many machines, so you can borrow documentation on it from everywhere - Amiga, Atari ST, Sinclair QL, Apple Mac - all they used 68K processors and there is litterally thousand of documentations you can use for reference. On the other hand the 65816 in the SNES is much less popular and only used in the Apple IIGS which was neither popular, nor prettly well documented. Hopefully the 65816 have 6502 mode you can use, but coding in assembler is much harder with all the required switches to 8 and 16 bit. The 68000 does not have problem with 8 and 16 bit modes.
<br />
<br />I prefer to code in assembler for the consoles, but C comes very handy. For Sega Mega Drive you can use almost any 68K compiler and tweak it to work for Mega Drive. And there are dozens of 68K C compilers. For the SNES there is the cc65 compiler, but its 65816 support is limited. There are not much compilers that can be used for SNES development.
<br />
<br />For the assemblers, I have dozen of very good 68K assebmlers on the Amiga, but WLA-DX is also very good assembler. Thanks to the author, WLA-DX is open sourced, so I have compiled it on my Amiga as well.
<br />
<br />With the Mega Drive you mostly need to know 68K and some hardware registers, while on the SNES you need to program the sound separately in another language. This makes SNES development even harder.
<br />
<br />The Mega Drive beats the SNES coding in terms of being easier and faster, but I enjoyed more coding for the SNES, because of the bigger challenge and the need for more experiments, than developing for Mega Drive, where is it much less fun.

<br />To be fair, you pretty much have to do that on the MD as well - at least if you want to use the DAC, since there's no timer interrupt, and letting the the 68k just sit and poll the timer is usually out of the question. 
<br />At last the z80 can access ROM directly, but the serial bankswitching mechanism sucks.

<br />Even if it is documented, the documentation isn't in a form that compilers' code generators understand. Plenty of compilers for Pascal, C, and other compiled languages popular in the early 1990s generate reasonably efficient code for the 68K family; fewer do for 65816. Show me a 65816 back-end for GCC to match the 68000 one and I'll listen to you.

<br />By well documented I did not meant only the instruction set. Instruction set is easy to find, but what about certain algorhytms, techniques, tricks to save processsor cycles, registers usage and memory?
<br />
<br />For the 68K it is much easier to find such documentation and tutorials. For the 65816 I read a Apple II coding newsletter for a while, which also had some 65816 topics covered, but for 68K you will find more information, easily, more techniques and better tricks. Assembler is not only about learning the instruction set. The instruction set can be learned in a day, to master Assembler you need to practice for years.

<br />I highly doubt many people had SMS consoles break and need the MD for BC. Plus Nintendo didn't support any BC and I don't recall people throwing a fit over it. It's a nice feature to have I agree. But it was a bad business decision I think. I really doubt the benefit from having it was worth the cost not only in the cost to the existing MD, but the cost it had on the MD not being able to be something better. As I said before, more Colors like 4 * 16 sets for each of Scroll Plane A, B, and Sprites would have been excellent. Pair that with an improvement in the sound department and I really think Sega could have blown Nintendo away in the 16bit era, atleast in the US and Europe though maybe not Japan.

CRAM memory needs to be fast so it's probably SRAM, which is usually implemented using complex gates (e.g. NOR gates), which eat up quite a fair share of transistors and thereby space. VSRAM may be the same too, which may explain why it has its own memory instead of being stored in VRAM (which is a separate chip in the original VDP).<br /><br />Basically, the built-in memory probably was too expensive in terms of die space, so they'd have needed to go with separate memory for those too if they wanted to expand them, definitely making it much more expensive.<br /><br />And if we're going to talk about missing features, well, what about their "superscaler" technology? That one would have been cool =/ Or how about having some proper sample hardware? Because the DAC implementation is completely crap, having absolutely no hardware timing at all. I think no arcade systems used the YM2612's (or whatever clone they used) DAC feature, but instead they used separate PCM chips.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">MottZilla wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">Unless your SMS broke.

<br />That theory I had made before is crap because it turns out S/H gives a color range that's definitely not 16 shades, besides they could have always made it an internal bit not used in CRAM =/ To be fair I think that the main reason that the LSB is unused is so each component belongs to a separate digit in hexadecimal (e.g. orange is $08E, with 0 = blue, 8 = green, E = red).

<br />
<br />I think that applies to Nintendo too, because of the Snes's near backwards compatable design.
<br />
<br />If Nintendo really wanted it to be backwards compatable that much, I think they should've used a slighty upgraded NES PPU, and have a second full fledged 16-bit PPU sitting next to it.  The full fledged 16-bit PPU doesn't have to be as powerful as the Genesis's VDP, as long as the sum of both PPUs are more powerful than the VDP.

<br />Or developer compatibility. By using a similar scheme as the NES, all the NES developers would be able to pick up the SNES more quickly. Same for the graphical scheme, which is quite similar.
