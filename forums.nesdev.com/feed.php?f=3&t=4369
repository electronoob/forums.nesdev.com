What if the default settings of monitors aren't the proper settings?  My LCD PC monitor's default settings puts contrast at 50 (out of 100) and brightness at 100.  If I put contrast at 100 and brightness at 0, it fixes the gamma problem somewhat, but it actually becomes extremely sensitive to viewing angle, so some pairs of colors (such as $0c and $02) still flip in luminance depending on if you're looking at the top or bottom of the screen.  My LCD HDTV's default settings sets brightness at around 33 out of 100 (there's no number) and contrast at around 67 out of 100, but there's no gamma problem.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3329">strangenesfreak</a> — Tue Nov 04, 2008 7:30 pm</p><hr />

The common gamma value of 2.2 (or 0.45 in reciprocal) includes the 2.0 from the fact that the power of the electron beam is proportional to the <em>square</em> of voltage under constant resistance (P = I^2*R = V^2/R). I don't know where the remaining 0.2 comes from.<br /><br />My understanding is that both a properly adjusted PC monitor and a properly adjusted TV will use this gamma value 2.2. But the black level control on consumer TVs is labeled "brightness", encouraging users to set it too high, and a high black level reduces the effective gamma value.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=9">tepples</a> — Tue Nov 04, 2008 6:22 pm</p><hr />

It' sworse than that.<br /><br />Many games were developed for consumer Ntsc on the NEs/Famicom.<br /><br />WHat this means is that many games orginally developed in japan were made for a yellow boosted palette, which was common on JP tvs at the time.<br /><br />US TVs usually boosted the REDs instead.<br /><br />If a game was developed in the US, generally the "consumer" palette in a NES emu gives correct output.  But if the game was originally japanese, the yellow boost should be turned on.  the RGB versions of the NES chip most closely replicate the yellow boosted palette, which is why rgb modded NESes look different from normal ones. (there's also the different handeling of the color emphasis bits)  ALL the screenshots in nintendo power were taken with a Famicom Titler which is effectively an RGB NES, which is why they didn't look like they did on your TV.<br /><br />On a JP consumer TV, fire mario wears yellow clothes instead of white.  Ths is replicated in the arcade version.  ON US tvs, he wears white instead. Luigi wears white on either, though.<br /><br />Nowadays, TVs dont'do that anymore.  A correct FPGA NES would tr and autodetect if the game needs a red or a yellow boost to display correctly adn adjust the palette as needed.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3700">_Zaphod_</a> — Fri Oct 10, 2008 7:01 pm</p><hr />

Sorry for double posting, but I tested my NES on my LCD TV; it looked wrong at 75% brightness, but after resetting to factory settings (25% brightness), it looks perfect.  So I don't think the LCD TV has a gamma problem.<br /><br />After reading <a href="http://www.poynton.com/notes/colour_and_gamma/GammaFAQ.html#desktop" class="postlink">this</a>, it appears that all of my monitors have 2.2 gamma; they just interpret the input's gamma differently.  So according to this article, video (I'm guessing this means TVs) interpret input gamma as 0.45.  I'm now guessing that my LCD PC monitor adheres to the "Computer Graphics" gamma standards, since gamma looks linear here and it is for the input images of "Computer Graphics".  I think my CRT PC monitors are either following the video (or even Macintosh) gamma standards for some reason, or are part of the monitors that have "poor or no standards" as mentioned in the article.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3329">strangenesfreak</a> — Sun Sep 28, 2008 5:57 pm</p><hr />

I have tested Battletoads's 1st level (the ground and the boss's red display) and I after playing with the brightness on both the LCD computer monitor (using an accurate palette with a PC emulator) and my CRT TV (running a real NES), I can confirm that the LCD monitor's gamma is off from the CRT's gamma.<br /><br />I think the real problem here is that my LCD monitor kind of sucks.  I cannot directly change gamma of my monitor without touching my video card settings, and neither the monitor itself nor my video card can change sharpness.  Thus, my monitor can never properly pass the <a href="http://www.lagom.nl/lcd-test/sharpness.php" class="postlink">Lagom sharpness test</a>.  In addition, I can never differentiate luminances 30-32 in this <a href="http://www.lagom.nl/lcd-test/contrast.php" class="postlink">contrast test</a> with decent black and white levels.<br /><br />For what it's worth, my monitor is an <a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=U&amp;start=10&amp;q=http://www.pcworld.com/product/specs/id,24354/acer_al1715.html&amp;usg=AFQjCNEIhxwARPmUC9A1ah78MFPLAoAjaw" class="postlink">Acer AL1715</a> and my computer uses a GeForce 2 Integrated GPU as a video card.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3329">strangenesfreak</a> — Thu Sep 11, 2008 2:19 pm</p><hr />

<div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"><br />In my LCD monitor, hues of the same luminance are much more closer to each other in value than on my CRT monitor.<br /></div>Properly calibrated sRGB LCD monitors should look exactly like properly calibrated sRGB CRT monitors. If not, it's a calibration problem, nothing to do in particular with the NES. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SRGB" class="postlink">sRGB has a somewhat complicated gamma</a>. Generally, people creating palettes should use a properly calibrated monitor in a defined viewing environment.<br /><br />If you're using an actual television connected to a NES as a reference, keep in mind that American NTSC uses a setup of 7.5%, meaning they are darker than Japanese NTSC at the same gamma. <br /><br />Also keep in mind that on the NES, most of the 0x colors generate negative RGB values after decoding, which will have different effects on different television sets. This is actually of great importance, because this is what determines whether color 0x07 will look "brown" or "red-brown, almost red". Konami games such as Life Force will expect the latter, Ghosts 'n' Goblins will expect the former, judging by how it is used with other colors.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=133">NewRisingSun</a> — Thu Sep 11, 2008 2:12 am</p><hr />

Wow Celius your uprgaded avatar is a lot better than the previous one !<br /><br />And I don't have much gamma problems with my NES, but have a lot of them with my PS2. Most games looks terribly dark, unless it's night it's often impossible to see anything on screen. For this reason I only play the PS2 in winter or during the night so that there is less sun light.<br />Some games with colorfull graphics like Dragon Quest 8 are completely spared, but some darker games are unplayable unless it's complete night. <br /><br />The problem may also come from a weird AV -&gt; RF converter that I belive was made by my dad, maybe he got something a little wrong with luminance ?<br /><br />PS : In the game I'm making I use red pixels surrounded by black to simulate punk needles on my character's belt. Unfortunatlely those are invisible on my CRT screen. I hesitate to modify the sprite but I don't know what to do to have them looking good.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=38">Bregalad</a> — Thu Sep 11, 2008 2:11 am</p><hr />

I'm surprised that (AFAIK) very few people, if any, had noticed this gamma problem with NES games on LCDs, since I'd imagine it could really interfere in creating "accurate" palettes...one test pic to see if your monitor (or NES palette) needs to be gamma corrected would be Celius's avatar.  Correct me if I'm wrong, but the Dracula form seems to use this kind of shading that's meant for the CRT gamma (2.2); it looks pretty nice with the correct gamma, but if it's too low (&lt;1), it'll look ugly.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3329">strangenesfreak</a> — Wed Sep 10, 2008 10:37 pm</p><hr />
