<br />Currently both SPC uploaders seem to do the same for me (as an outsider). Is that so or is one better than the other?
<br />If I understand that correctly there is no way to upload another SPC after the first is uploaded to the APU. How did the game developers do that? It has to work somehow I guess. IIRC there were games in which the music was stopped during the game, too. Would this be done by uploading an empty SPC file?

<br />Each SPC program can receive commands on the four input ports. One command might be "stop song"; another might be "start other song whose note pattern data is already loaded"; another might be "reset and prepare to load another SPC". But these commands differ from one player routine to another.

<br />
<br />Or you could run the entire .SPC (at least everything between offsets $00100 and $100FF) through an SPC700 disassembler and search for such reads in the resulting code if you think using a debugger is cumbersome. The problem with this is that the disassembler can't tell code from data so it may end up messing up the disassembly.

The SNES SDK uses a modified version of WLA 9.4 with which I can not create a ROM from your spc player source. I got it working only with the usual WLA 9.5 I found somewhere, however I can't use this version within the SDK because of strange errors when assembling/linking.
<br />I somehow integrated parts of your source into my game though and tried calling the ASM "function" LoadSPC from C, although something went wrong because the game freezes when calling it. I'll have to investigate a bit further although currently I have no real idea what I'm doing <img src="./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" />
<br />Is there a way to step through the LoadSPC function while my program executes it (maybe with the BSNES debugger or something)?

<br />Use bsnes-debugger.exe.  Open Tools-&gt;Debugger. Check the "Step S-CPU" box. Press Break. Press Step as many times as you like.
<br />
<br />One thing that might help is if you could see the assembly that the C compiler generates from your C code. Like how it's actually calling the LoadSPC function.
<br />Since I haven't used SNESC myself I don't know if it's possible to make it output an assembly file for you.

<br />What does this tell me and is there something I can do about it? At least it looks like the ASM code is called correctly. I found out the SNESC compiler does not allow inline ASM for the 65816 target...
<br />
<br />Is there a way in BSNES to see the log of the running program without clicking STEP a thousand times? Other than that it's pretty helpful <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />
<br />
<br />And yes the compiler itself only creates ASM files so I can see my program in assembly.
<br />
<br />edit:
<br />I used Geigers debugger to get what I wanted. I've reduced my code to a minimum to find the error. Here's my current code:
<br /><a href="http://pastebin.com/TcHKqG2i" class="postlink">http://pastebin.com/TcHKqG2i</a>
<br />And here's the log from shortly before it hangs. Can anybody see what happened before it hangs? My assembly knowledge doesn't seem to suffice <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />

<br />Yes. Check the "Trace S-CPU opcodes" box in the debugger window. You'll get a large file in the BSNES directory that lists all the instructions that were executed.

<br />
<br />Anyway, the fact that you don't hear any music could mean e.g. that you're uploading the wrong data to the SPC. My loading code relies on a LOROM configuration, with the .SPC data being located in banks 1, 2 and 3 (this could be changed by altering SPC_DATA_BANK and SPC_REG_ADDR in loadspc.asm). Take a look at your .SMC file in a hex editor and make sure that the data starting at offset 0x10000 in the .SMC matches the data starting at offset 0x100 in the .SPC file. And the data at 0xC000 in the .SMC should match the data at 0x10100 in the .SPC.
<br />
<br />You can also use the memory editor in BSNES' debugger to look at the S-APU RAM to see if the correct data has been uploaded to it.
