It's pretty easy these days to deliver an emulator-specific rom format if one felt that the legacy standard was holding back compatibility gaurantees. A set of 2300 files uploaded to numerous hosting sites and linked to on several forums would eventually show up on filesearch engines and google. You can't convert a bad or missing header into a working file, any sort of tool would take significantly longer and be less reliable than finding one of these links where the conversion work has been done for you.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3720">FitzRoy</a> — Tue May 22, 2012 7:25 pm</p><hr />

Are you sure you want to discuss this here? It'll detract from your NES format discussion. But well, think of it like this:<br /><br />On the NES, you can have the MMC1 or MMC3, and these chips control what ROM data is mapped to what bus address range (eg it controls what the CPU reads from certain areas.)<br /><br />Their biggest use is that the NES is limited to 32KB ROM space. So you write to these chips to ask it to swap some (or all) of that space with other ROM data.<br /><br />The only analogues on the SNES are the SPC7110, S-DD1 and the BS-X town cartridge. Possibly the SA-1 if you stretch the definition. And true to form, when those are described in my markup, they just say "these bus addresses can be remapped by these chips."<br /><br />When it comes to all other SNES carts, they can easily map up to ~10-12MB into the existing address space without a bank mapper. So in all honesty, the bank remapping is pretty stupid. There was no SNES game that ever required that functionality. It just made SO and FEoEZ harder to develop.<br /><br />So most SNES games had their own mapping chips. The most popular was the MAD-1, but it was overkill for the simplicity of games on eg 1A0N boards. Those just used simple logic gate chips like the 74LS series. What these chips do is translate SNES bus addresses to ROM and/or RAM chip addresses. It selects the appropriate chip for an address, and transforms the address to be linear for that individual chip.<br /><br />So in a very real way, we could replace all of the &lt;map address=... offset=... size=...&gt; stuff with &lt;mapper type="MAD-1" pinout="..."/&gt;, and reproduce the map that way as well. But that's a lot like saying "we can eliminate half the board types on the NES", a lot of these boards are just simple 74LS logic chips once again. Only they're a tiny bit more advanced, since they have primitive bank mapping by way of being writable (they are decade counters, usually.)<br /><br />So when we say "NES-CNROM", we are really saying "board with a 74LS decade counter connected to these pins of the ROM address line." And when we say "S-DD1", we are saying something similar about that mapper+ROM chip. And when you talk about a0=x,a1=y pinout on VRC-n boards, what you're really doing is describing the only pins that change between officially released titles. The real VRC chip probably has something like 20 - 80 different pins on it. It's a huge jump to allow arbitrary connection of those pins to support any possible configuration (even non-sensical ones like connecting +5V to bus audio left channel, for instance.)<br /><br />Now it would be nice to come up with an implementation that allowed us to wire every pin between every chip in XML, but it would be an absolute nightmare to emulate such a beast, and performance would drop dramatically. Think about that Pong circuit simulator I used to talk about, or Visual 6502. And I think we both know that's not an option at this point anymore.<br /><br />My SNES XML maps build a 16MB mapping table, so that when you read an address, all it has to do is a memory fetch to determine what type of memory is there, then call a function pointer form a table indexed by that type. That function can mask the address, and return the underlying memory. Even this is already painful, but it's very linear.<br /><br />Trying to do a chip-level simulation would be far more complicated. And I'd be surprised if we didn't have NES carts with more than one 74LS chip.<br /><br />There is also the fact that with the SNES, I'm more interested in homebrew development there. For instance, there would be no way to do the FEoEZ expansion nor run neviksti's Star Ocean 96mbit patch, if not for the XML remapping. And we don't even really have all the details of the pinouts for all logic mappers on the SNES side, so we couldn't simulate that even if we wanted to.<br /><br />Technically, the SNES XML format I use can do everything SNES-used 74LS and MAD-1 chips can do, and much more. And it results in faster emulation. But it does make the spec more complex. The same, however, cannot be easily done on the NES, because unlike the SNES, the NES almost always needs to bank-swap in more ROM data. You can't describe something like that with just a plain list of range+offset+length entries. The underlying content changes dynamically.<br /><br />This is basically the big problem I have with MAME/MESS. You can't mash every system ever into the same structure. It just makes them all overly complicated and confusing. Instead, you should take into account the realities of each system, and make something that works best for it. And I'll say right now, I don't currently have the expertise to do this for the NES, like I do for the SNES. So my spec is very much going to be evolving for the next several years as I learn more.<br /><br />To be quite honest, I don't even think it's appropriate for emulators to share an XML game mapping. It's highly dependent upon how the emulator was developed. It really should all be done internally with a database for games. But the problem there is you just can't support homebrew that way, so at some point you -have- to describe something for board formats. And then you get people jumping down your throat thinking you're out to kill iNES 1.0, which is nonsense.<br /><br />As such, worrying about a hypothetical NES cart with non-linear mapping of two PROMs is kind of silly. You're going to need a logic chip to decode the bus address and select the appropriate chip anyway. So we specify that logic chip in the markup, and the emulator will know what to do with it.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=375">byuu</a> — Tue May 22, 2012 2:05 am</p><hr />

If a sha256 hash keeps working, then why would anyone switch to sha3?<br /><br />But let's say you legacy supported everything and just pretended that people updated. You could write a version tag into every manifest file. If version 11 adds sha3 support, then the emulator would know by the version tag what hash type the manifest contains.<br /><br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"><br />The SNES loves to do this, which is why the SNES has the map mode+offset+size attributes.<br />*If* any NES games do this, then it's most likely a detail of the mapper. Mappers are kind of a recurring trend on the NES.<br /></div><br /><br />If the SNES did this, then you're referring to 1YAON boards and stuff where the program is multi-chip, but could have or was released single chip on a 1A0N. If the 1YA0N board behaves differently than a 1A0N board, but the behavior is superfluous in output to the 1A0N variant, then I see no reason to release the rom in both variations and give them each their own mapping entry. The destination is the same even if the journey was different, it's redundant.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3720">FitzRoy</a> — Mon May 21, 2012 1:33 pm</p><hr />

&gt; Unlicensed games that your emulator's users are likely to have actually owned, such as those by Camerica and Color Dreams. I currently own a copy of Bee 52, and at various times, I have owned a copy of Bible Adventures, The King of Kings, and Exodus.<br /><br />In that case, I really hope Bible Adventures uses some non-standard hardware. Religious proselytization in a children's video game is disgusting :P<br /><br />&gt; In 10 years, iNES 2.0 will be there<br /><br />Hahahahahahah, keep dreaming. I'll bet you all the money in my 401K that won't happen. Even No-Intro has zero interest in it.<br /><br />Moving on from iNES requires more than 10% of people to agree on anything. Judging from this thread, that'll be one cold day in hell.<br /><br />You <strong>must</strong> remove support for iNES 1.0 first, and nobody here is idealistic enough to do that. Casual gamers will never upgrade their ROMs if you continue to support them in 1.0.<br /><br />&gt; and this won't be anywhere. Deal with it and move on from this garbage.<br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgRLG1tl9DE#t=47s">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgRLG1tl9DE#t=47s</a><!-- m --><p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=375">byuu</a> — Mon May 21, 2012 1:25 pm</p><hr />
