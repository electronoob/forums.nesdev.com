		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />1. The official way to install XAudio2 is just as part of the DirectX runtime installer. Microsoft forbids developers from distributing individual DLLs like that, and DLLs often have their own dependencies, so you might need more than just that one.<br /><br />2. The DirectX runtime is actually installed by Windows Update at this point because it's a critical part of windows. You should have it already, unless you're running XP, I think?<br /><br />Here's some info:<br /><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ca/kb/179113" class="postlink">https://support.microsoft.com/en-ca/kb/179113</a><br />(There's info on this page about how to get the installer.)

Windows 7 doesn't come with DX9, nor are there any Windows Updates for it.  Not sure if this is relevant to the situation or not though.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />As far as I know(correct me if I am wrong), Windows from Vista onwards(don't know about 10) install a <em>very</em> old version of DX9 for whatever stupid reason, alongside the recent version of DX that the Windows support (since DX10 and above aren't downward compatible with DX9). And that DX9 would not be updated automatically by Windows Update, so if anyone gets a DX9 error (which is very common, unfortunately), he/she should try to manual update DX9 first.

Nvidia, AMD or Intel?<br /><br />I'm on a AMD R9 380 card using Crimson 16.3.1 drivers. Could be GPU/Driver related but that's only a guess.<br /><br />Mind posting a screenshot of how this crazy colored palette looks and which palette?

I thought D3D9 meant Direct 3d or something else for advanced pc's and that SDL was the regular standard version because I don't know anything about computers LOL. I have always had problems with OpenGL with other emulators for example when I try openGL with Snes9x it stops responding and shuts down.  I tried the D3D9 version and it works perfect. Thanks again.

Turned off Pixel Aspect Ratio - GLSL soft stretch and colors are normal.<br /><br />Bug? 8:7 aspect ratio + Use NTSC RGB filter + Fullscreen = doesn't look correct ratio using Tepples' 240pee.nes (linearity test) - looks 1:1 unstretched<br /><br />Also if I use PAL mode, how do I switch to PAL TV aspect ratio?<br /><br />Thank you for great project (and adding Firebrandx palette)
