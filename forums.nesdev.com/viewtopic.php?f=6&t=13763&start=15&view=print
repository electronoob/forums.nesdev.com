An option to just ignore $4011 writes <em>is</em> another way to do it, but this has undesirable effects on the nonlinear mixing of the triangle + noise + DMC, i.e. anything that's trying to use it for limited volume control of the triangle (e.g. Super Mario Bros, Startropics) will lose the intended effect.<br /><br />Personally I would support both these options.

Even rainwarrior and his modification of the <a href="http://rainwarrior.ca/projects/nsfplay/" class="postlink">NSFplug/play</a> library has evolved since audio player routines have evolved out of the 25 year old drivers used in videogames into something else.  (See <a href="http://www.delek.com.ar/deflemask" class="postlink">Deflemask</a> and its PCM routine used to get around NSF1's lack of IRQ.)<br /><br />If you want to even reference the realm of commercial music and games see <a href="http://dutycyclegenerator.com/" class="postlink">Neil</a> <a href="http://www.nes-audio.com/" class="postlink">Baldwin</a> of modern and classic 2a0x audio and art (ex: Magician, James Bond Jr., Hero Quest, etc.)  Some of his modern music creation software cannot even be replayed with the NSF1 format.<br /><br />I fail to see your stance that art/music that you find an interest in enough to create a player for a format that's not currently up-to-date is irrelevant.  Even kevtris (author of ported format resembling PSID) plays modern art NSFs on his hardware players and has introduced the 90% complete NSF2 format due to some of the issues that are limitations of past and future creations that are capable to be replicated on hardware with ROMs/mappers/expansions.<br /><br />I don't think you're rude; but I'm confused in your perspective and intentions with your NSF player -- unless you intend to keep it to yourself for personal enjoyment.

That's the realm of a full emulator, and while I could write a full emulator if people wanted me to, there are already plenty of them out there that do a better job than I would.

He's never offered a working player to the world, there's no reason anyone trying to push an NSF2 spec would have to work with whatever arbitrary hardware decisions he made.

RQ_Variant</a><!-- m --><br /><br />On further consideration, perhaps we should consider promoting it to an official part of the spec, though? The complaint was that it uses SEI to mask hardware interrupts, which interferes with hardware that might rely on them, but because it is a non-returning play I think it might be a non-issue. If it was supposed to drive PLAY with interrupts, SEI is actually appropriate in a non-returning PLAY.

RQ_Variant</a><!-- m --><br /><br />On further consideration, perhaps we should consider promoting it to an official part of the spec, though? The complaint was that it uses SEI to mask hardware interrupts, which interferes with hardware that might rely on them, but because it is a non-returning play I think it might be a non-issue. If it was supposed to drive PLAY with interrupts, SEI is actually appropriate in a non-returning PLAY.</div>That is what I thought too when I looked at it; yes since it is a non-returning PLAY, it should be safe to do so (although some hardware implementations might then make it impossible to stop the music or select a different track without resetting the console, but I do not consider this to be a significant problem).

That's my only problem here - time, documentation and testing. I'm one person with limited free time and lots of other things I'd like to do with it - and I haven't even seen a single NSF2 file. Why support something that, as far as I am currently aware, doesn't even exist yet?<br /><br />Just to clear up any confusion, my complaint with your original comment was that you suggested features that would require me to emulate things like an arcade machine or a PPU, both of which are outside the scope of this particular project - I seriously doubt that any NSF-related format would require support for two CPUs or a PPU. That's the realm of a full emulator, and while I could write a full emulator if people wanted me to, there are already plenty of them out there that do a better job than I would.</div><br /><br />I could make a NSF2 file with original music easily but unless people have the interest to create an emulated player my art dreams don't fly.  You also mention Famicompo Pico.  That is run by a colleague of mine (and fellow administrator) in <a href="http://battleofthebits.org/" class="postlink">Battle of the Bits</a>  We've been known to host competitions to test FamiTracker betas before they were released and we distributed SuperNSF source after Famicompo from mukunda and #mod_shrine.<br /><br />Where I have more expertise in creative and &quot;out of the box&quot; thinking my expertise in high-level programming is not the greatest.  I understand assembly code and hardware fairly well.<br /><br />My position is advocacy for a community who does not understand potentiality of IRQ support for the 2a0x chip for music/art production.  Let's consider <a href="http://membler-industries.com/squeedo/" class="postlink">Memblers's Squeedo cart with MIDI in and custom driver/&quot;patches&quot;</a> (a cart relying on IRQ and cycle counting to produce additional timbres)...  I doubt any hacking of LOAD/INIT/PLAY routines could get code to play on modern NSF players or hardware players.<br /><br />I never said NSF2 was complete.  It's about 90% done.  I believe I remember that kev has made NSF2 rips and has played a few on his hardware player; but he and we know that the format lacks a few things and has a conflict:  <br /><br />1.)  Nobody has agreed on where the Title/Author/Track/etc documentation header/footer is.  <br />2.)  The NSF IRQ &quot;registers&quot; are located overtop of the 2a0x audio TEST registers and need to be moved elsewhere.  Just in case these are used.  <br /><br />Someone who's writing an NSF(2) player just needs to move forward with these two discrepancies to have much desired/needed IRQ supported.  Who really wants to write their own hacked routine to rip PCM or IRQ related routines when a proposed format can do it.  This would ease in the ripping process and allow for growth into readily-present hardware capability.<br /><br />Regarding your comment on the hardware emulation requests:  Most of those features are already emulated by MESS/MAME; as you say -- and there's no shame in taking readily available code.  Even rainwarrior's NSFplay is hardly original.  Two things out of the bunch that are not currently emulated are 2a0x audio TEST and Mitsubishi M50805 for &quot;Family Trainer 3: Aerobics Studio&quot;; which is an LPC decoder with factory ROM and hardware modes to allow for input of LPC datastreams.  I've created test NSFs that rely on $6000-based expansion registers for this setup.  (I should probably just write a test CopyNES driver with the cart in to make something artistic with my Aerobics Studio instead.)<br /><br />Nobody's making you have an interest in anything because that's impossible.  Interest is sprouted from within.  Let me know if you want to make some music and come by Battle of the Bits for some fun.
