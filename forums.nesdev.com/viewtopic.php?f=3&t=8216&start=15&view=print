From my viewpoint, we deal with 3 modules: CPU, APU and PPU. Well, the mother-thing is the CPU - we deal with instructions being executed as "steps", read a byte from a given memory adress, add with the accumulator register etc., and then the PPU is "clocked". Actually, I must call APU before the PPU because of DMC DMA thing, but that's another kind of abstraction.

<br />Back to the subject, <strong>that's what I fear</strong> while running most of the blargg's tests. An easy hack (or workaround) would get a pass. That's "unfair", a penalty in your emulation scheme.
<br />
<br />Remember that even the Nintendo and its Virtual Console doesn't emulate the things perfectly. I played Star Fox 64 recently and... wow, it has lots of emulation quirks.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />With the APU, it isn't much of an issue, since all of its features are clocked at either the CPU clock, or one half that.
<br />
<br />As for the fears of what the Right Way is, there's only three ways to determine that:
<br />
<br />Get a rather fast logic analyzer, and oversample all the pins between the CPU and PPU, and see what the waveforms look like. Depending on how fast the LA is, there'll be some quantization error, but above 20MHz or so that shouldn't matter.
<br />
<br />Watch the clock, R/W, NMI, address, and data lines on a Fast Enough oscilloscope (probably take several, given the number of signals) and see what things look like in analog.
<br />
<br />Get a Visual 2A03 and a Visual 2C02 set up and connected with each other, and run a simulation trace to give you the equivalent of the waves above. This will probably be subject to certain idealistic simplifications regarding transistor speeds, trace delays, etc.

I don't see much point in hacking an inaccurate workaround just to get points on some arbitrary checklist, when the result would likely be wrong for every other register on the system anyway.

<br />
<br />Agree completely. I actually have about 1,000 SNES tests, but I don't release them because I don't want people trying to pass them explicitly to the detriment of doing things right.
<br />
<br />Fundamentally, there is a core minimum level necessary to express all hardware effects cleanly and without unnatural checks and hacks/workarounds. Whether that level is at the cycle-level, or if we have to simulate phi1/phi2 phases, or we have to simulate the warming up of transistors as the system runs ... there is a point where we can perfectly simulate all observable behaviors.
<br />
<br />And that point is, to me, quintessential to preservation. No, emulators do not have to work at this ultimate lower-level. We only need ONE emulator that does it, and documents all of the lowest-level timing information. And from here, we can abstract general-purpose playable emulators that take appropriate shortcuts where applicable. The biggest and most obvious being the elimination of the "pseudo-random" effects of things like power-on states for RAM, bizarre hardware glitches, etc ... stuff that no official or sane homebrew software would ever rely on.
<br />
<br />It's very disappointing to me, because I believed the NES scene was at this point already. What I've discovered is that cycle-level PPU timing for the NES is "easy" (once you know how it works; it was still a reverse-engineering marvel that it was figured out in the first place), and can be done in 10-15KB of code. I mistook it as being more amazing because the SNES PPU is ungodly complex by comparison. Aside from that, NES CPU timing actually seems, in some ways, to be more primitively understood than SNES CPU timing :/
<br />
<br />I just really feel like, across the board for every system ... we start emulation as a top-down approach, instead of the bottom-up approach that it should be. And it just takes so much longer to reach perfection this way, it's not even funny. You don't build you house by starting with the roofing.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I would challenge that claim that SNES CPU/PPU timing is more well known than NES. I see nothing in any doc regarding which master clock read data comes from, or write data hits.
<br />
<br />Unfortunately, the same testcase you're running into on the NES wouldn't translate directly to the SNES, since the vblank flag and NMI there are generated on the CPU, and I don't see any mention of NMI suppression or a readback glitch with $4210 or $4200. I'd suggest that SNES timing isn't that well understood either, but the current state of the art for CPU/PPU interleaving there happens to match, since I don't see any particular register setups where the subtleties would be visible. On the NES, the VBL/NMI interaction is about the only one I can think of, as it requires a register that is readable, that can also have the value changing underneath it across the read cycle, and that also has some other functionality dependent on writes elsewhere, and where the update portion is running at a higher frequency than the CPU.
<br />
<br />Emulators tend to start top down, because that's usually how the documentation tends to approach things.
<br />
<br />Incidentally, if Q's visual 2A03 is to be believed, the divided CPU clock is 50/50 in the NES.
