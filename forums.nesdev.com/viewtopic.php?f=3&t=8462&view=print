		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Argh! Started adding the shell of a PPU and now none of blargg's tests pass at all. (See example below). This makes no sense to me at all, because I can pass nestest.nes with flying colors until the undocumented instructions - about 5260 instructions in.
<br />
<br />I'm guessing that I'm fouling up one instruction slightly that is in the harness of blargg's tests that is causing it to fail the tests even when they would pass. I tried comparing a nintendulator log with my run, but the comparison gets all fouled up because the test is banging the PPU:
<br />
<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">E947&nbsp; 2C 02 20&nbsp; BIT $2002 = FF&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A:00 X:31 Y:15 P:24 SP:FB CYC:300 SL:240<br />E94A&nbsp; 30 06&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;BMI $E952&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;A:00 X:31 Y:15 P:26 SP:FB CYC:312 SL:240<br />E94C&nbsp; CA&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; DEX&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;A:00 X:31 Y:15 P:26 SP:FB CYC:318 SL:240<br />E94D&nbsp; D0 F8&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;BNE $E947&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;A:00 X:30 Y:15 P:24 SP:FB CYC:324 SL:240<br />E947&nbsp; 2C 02 20&nbsp; BIT $2002 = FF&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A:00 X:30 Y:15 P:24 SP:FB CYC:333 SL:240<br />E94A&nbsp; 30 06&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;BMI $E952&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;A:00 X:30 Y:15 P:A6 SP:FB CYC:&nbsp; 4 SL:241</div>
<br />
<br />(There's something I don't understand in this snippet where nintendulator does NOT set the negative flag on P after doing a BIT on $FF and $00 but then DOES set the negative flag a few instructions later doing the exact same thing. Is nintendulator lying about the value returned from the PPU? ($2002)).
<br />
<br />I tried debugging the instruction test by hand, but it seems impossible. Does anyone know what I might be getting wrong to trip up blargg's tests but not nestest.nes? Any suggestions for alternate debug paths? Is there a way to whip up a version of the tests that don't access the PPU at all, so I could compare with nintendulator?
<br />
<br />Aside from all that, I can run Donkey Kong with my faux PPU at least far enough to watch it set the different registers, throw data at it for the name tables and image/sprite palettes, and ask for DMA transfers.

Typically passing nestest.nes yet failing all of blarggs CPU tests means one your CPU flags isn't working correctly, I would check to make sure you are handling status bits 2, 3, 4, and 5 correctly.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />i had the EXACT same problem you are having. passed nestest easily, but failed blargg's in the exact same way. check your BIT opcode. how are you settings the flags in that one?
<br />
<br />the highest two bits of the status flag should match the highest two bits of the instruction's operand before any calculations.
<br />
<br />here's what mine looks like:
<br />
<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">static void bit&#40;&#41; &#123;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; value = getvalue&#40;&#41;;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; result = &#40;uint16_t&#41;a &amp; value;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; zerocalc&#40;result&#41;;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; status = &#40;status &amp; 0x3F&#41; | &#40;uint8_t&#41;&#40;value &amp; 0xC0&#41;;<br />&#125;<br /></div>
<br />
<br />zerocalc of course sets the zero flag based on the AND result of the accumulator and the operand.
<br />
<br />anyway, i'm betting your problem is incorrectly handling those flags like it was for me. my bug was a typo on the last line. i had (status &amp; 0xBF) instead of 0x3F so if the sign flag was currently set, it remained set even if it was not set in the source operand.

<br />Great guess! I was setting IRQ_DISABLE in php. Now I pass all of the tests except for the stack instructions (which I seem to "fail" all of) and brk. No clue with those either. Is failure there still likely to be P flags or something else?
<br />
<br />(Having tests is awesome! Not having any idea why they believe they are failing is less awesome. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" alt=":(" title="Sad" />).

<br />I think IRQ_DISABLE was mostly the culprit here, since I'm now passing the majority of the tests. I double-checked my bit anyway, and it looks fine. Thanks for the advice, though.
<br />
<br />Now if only I could find the problem with the stack functions and I'd be 99%.

<br />I think what I have meets the spirit of that, e.g. I think "ignoring bits 4 and 5" is equivalent to asserting them low and high respectively.

<br />
<br />EDIT: i guess that doesn't matter either way, as ~ definitely has the highest precedence of those operators... nevermind me.
