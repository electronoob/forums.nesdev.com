		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Hello there guys, I've successfully created some repros.<br />So much fun ! lol, except i've only made single rom 8bit ones.<br /><br />I have a question, because my next try, will be multi eprom.<br /><br />I know that, to use more than 1 EPROM in a single rom donor cart, the donor cart needs to have a mad 1 right? <br />(if I'm wrong, how to use multi eprom on a non mad-1 chip donor cart?)<br /><br />Then, if we need more than 1 extra eprom, we need 74hct139 right?<br />Please correct me if im wrong.<br /><br />Well, I opened a donor cart here, SHVC-1A3B-12.<br /><br />This doesn't have a MAD-1 . It has an HD74LS139P.<br />I am confused because, it looks to me it does the same job the mad-1 would, but it isn't a mad-1.<br /><br />How do I wire to eproms with this?<br /><br />Thanks !

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />You need to search the forums.  This topic has been discussed many times with diagrams and pictures.<br /><br />The 139 decoder works like this:  it only allows 1 of 4 EPROMs to be enabled at any time.  So it is a rom selector.   If more than 1 rom is enable at the same time, that's called buss contention....when you have more than 1 rom on a databuss, only 1 can be enabled.   So the &quot;OE&quot; signal is transferred to any 1 of the 4 output lines.  And when the OE is high, it disables ALL the roms connected to the 139.  This is so the SRAM can be activated and used.  Rom enabled-- SRAM disabled.  SRAM enabled--rom disabled.  The mad1 chips is just a decoder like a 139 with added battery memory retention circuitry.  The mad1 passes the OE signal to the rom or roms just like a 139.   <br /><br />Every additional address line doubles the roms size.  Your 8mbit EPROMs has a high address line of A19.  So a 16mbit device would have a high address A20,   32mbit .... A21,   64mbit .....A22<br />So if you want a second 8mbit EPROM to add, then you have to have a decoder so only 1 rom is enabled at any given time.  So you would connect address A20 to the decoder as 1 of the inputs and when ever A20 is selected, it disables the first rom and enables the 2nd rom...<br /><br />Anyway, search the forums, you should be able to find your answers
