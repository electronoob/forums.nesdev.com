<br />So you are assuming that what defines an emulator is the existence of the simulated machine? You know, some may describe emulators as programs that simulate machines different than the ones they run on, whether they exist or not.
<br />
<br />It may make more sense that way, because if it was the other way around a program would have its status changed once the fictional machine it simulates was built in hardware, without any actual change to it. The same thing goes for NES emulators, that would stop being emulators once all NES consoles of the world perished (like blargg said).
<br />
<br />To me, emulation is just a specialized form of simulation, and you can in fact simulate things that haven't happened yet. Emulation/simulation doesn't necessarily rely on reverse engineering.

<br />You didn't get the idea, as it seems so... <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /> If a system doesn't exist, you can't emulate it. Ok, it was <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-order_logic" class="postlink">first-order logic</a> - as you need a blueprint/project/whatever defined description of an hypothetical machine.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Sometime last year I wrote a weird emulation system that simulates 1,000s of 6502 based robots, all executing in parallel.  Actual bot code is built using cc65/ca65  I defined my own devices (they live from $0200 to $02ff).  Bots can communicate with each other, move, fire weapons, etc...  They have an energy budget, and "die" when they run out of energy, exec an invalid opcode or self-terminate.
<br />
<br />The bots all execute in lock-step.  Each one gets XX cpu cycles (normally 64).  The system keeps track of any "cycle overage" and it gets billed against the quantum on the next turn.  All "live" bots execute in round-robin.
<br />
<br />I never finished the project, but it does run.  It is kind of neat to watch 1000 vs 1000 of wolf-pack vs serial-killer (two of my bots)
