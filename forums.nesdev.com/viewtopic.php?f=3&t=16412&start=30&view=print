I posted the Kazzo dumping script so that some other collector could dump his copy and come forward and publicly release his dump. Having emulator support ready might increase the willingness to do so.

And those caps on this PCB are indeed for CIC purpose.<br /><br />But later I saw at this PCB in more details and saw only 1 latch so there is no possible of having 2 regs.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"> I'm still waiting for krzysiobal for clarification of the D0...D3 instead of D3..D6 bits before I change the wiki article</div><br />Do you see any way how tracks from CART-45, CART-48, CART-48 can go to U1-11 (D0), U1-12 (D1), U1-13 (D2) and simulatenously go to U4-3, U4-4, U4-5, U4-6?

It would have to write $00 and then $08 according to your schematic. (And the PRG-ROM content at $FFE0/$FFE1 matches what is written.)<br /><br />Actually, I don't see how you know for sure that cartridge pins 46-43 must go to U1 and then to U4A, but that pins 49-47 cannot. You've drawn the red lines that way, but I don't see that from the original pictures. If one had another picture with U1 removed, it would clarify further, but I don't think that's something I can ask of the original cartridge owner.<br /><div class="quotetitle">tepples wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">But how can emulator support be ready if it cannot be tested?</div>Nintendulator support is ready, since I already have posted a tested source file (and can repost a compiled Mapper DLL file).

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Hm. There is at least one other NTDEC board (Asder 20-in-1) that does in fact latch the address rather than the data bus, so it wouldn't be out of character for them. So it would be actually:<div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">void&nbsp; &nbsp;MAPINT&nbsp; &nbsp;Write8000 (int Bank, int Addr, int Val) {<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;PRG = (Addr &gt;&gt;2) &amp;3;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;CHR = Addr &amp;3;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;Sync();<br />}<br />void&nbsp; &nbsp;MAPINT&nbsp; &nbsp;Reset (RESET_TYPE ResetType) {<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;iNES_SetMirroring();<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;for (int i=0x08; i&lt;0x10; i++) EMU-&gt;SetCPUWriteHandler(i, Write8000);<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;if (ResetType == RESET_HARD) PRG = CHR = 0;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;Sync();<br />}</div>This would at least provide working emulation. For the $6000 write one would still need to resort to the &quot;compatibility write for a different PCB&quot; explanation though. Maybe it's used on a 60-pin version of the game.

In FCEUX, this belongs in addrlatch.cpp.<br /><br /><br />Register at $6000 could be equally easily excused as &quot;changed in development&quot; or &quot;there to confuse reproduction-makers&quot;

The Kazzo dumping script needs no modification, as it just straight-up replicates what the game writes, including the spurious $6000 write.

The Kazzo assumes it can just completely overpower the ROMs on the cart, and it's almost always right.<br /><br />It'd still be ideal if the dumper script took steps to prevent bus conflicts.
