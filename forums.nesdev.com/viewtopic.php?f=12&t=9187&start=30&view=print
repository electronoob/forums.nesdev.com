If you wanted to get the same effect horizontally you'd start having issues though (as trying to change the scroll every pixel is just... plain insane, and it may even be cached at the beginning of the line making that impossible).

In English, there's a difference between &quot;screw with&quot;, which is neutral, and &quot;screw up&quot;, which carries a connotation of breakage. The various raster effects on NES hardware, especially the $2006-$2005-$2005-$2006 writes and extending vblank with forced blank, are methods of &quot;screwing with&quot; the PPU to produce a desired, stable result. So are the methods to manipulate so-called &quot;bad lines&quot; on the Commodore 64's VIC-II in order to produce smaller attribute areas, larger sprite counts, border intrusions, and the like. So are the various extended modes of the MMC5, in fact. I was just wondering if toggling mosaic at just the right point on the scanline would trick the PPU into forgetting the mosaic data that it had saved for the scanline and fetch new data for the next scanline instead.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I have no idea how the SNES PPU works internally at all, but if it's anything like the Mega Drive, it doesn't cache the tilemaps at all but reads them on-the-fly as it rasters. No idea if the mosaic data is cached, though (which could be a possibility, especially since it can work with non-power-of-two values). It's also possible it may work, but only on a 16 pixel granularity (considering that mosaic seems to work on that step amount).<br /><br />Is there any research on how the SNES PPU renders each scanline? Maybe Byuu has more info?

Sorry if I got your hopes up.  It's not actually direct colour; it's just a dynamic palette, changing entries during HBlank as the opportunity arises.  It doesn't do anything fancy with the hardware.<br /><br />But at least it doesn't halt the CPU, and the pixels are normal-sized...<br /><br />According to byuu (circa bsnes v0.22) CGRAM internal addresses are scrambled during active display, like the OAM, and according to nocash force blank is always black.  Also I don't think the SNES displays glitch pixels like the MD when you change the palette (but I don't have a source for that and you can probably disregard it).  So I'm not sure how one would go about accessing the full 15-bit palette directly.<br /><br />...on the other hand, Joshua Cain's 32,768 colour demo from 2002 really does display 32,768 colours - it just looks more like that &quot;Font colour&quot; box to the right of this post editor I'm using than any sort of actual picture.  And it doesn't come close to filling the screen.  And it works fine in ZSNES.  I suspect it's just a combination of fairly conventional methods.<br /><br />Either way, precisely-timed hardware exploitation isn't really my speed right yet - this is literally my first ROM.  It's just a bloody hack of the slideshow demo from Neviksti's SNES Starter Kit, and the HDMA code started out as a copy/paste from the tutorial on smwcentral...<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">Sik wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"><div class="quotetitle">93143 wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">If you get the chance, could you post it?

I don't know how much colors are actually display but in conjunction with the RGB555 master palette the result is definitely very good and far better than what the MD RGB333 BITMAP mode can do !<br />Actually you used the &quot;classical&quot; scanline palette reprogramming but maybe at the maximum capabilities for the SNES.<br />The same method is used in the &quot;Overdrive&quot; MD demo to display a 512 colors image: they abuse of palette reprogramming during HBlank. The advantage on SNES is that you can use HDMA for that and so have CPU free (it just need to prepare the HDMA tables).<br />In &quot;Overdrive&quot; the HBlank area is extended so we can send more colors during blank period than usual... but because of that, we cannot use the H-Int anymore and the CPU is almost 100% busy in handling that (only VBlank period to do something else).

Mode 3 gives you a 256-color BG1 and a 16-color BG2, and 256-color layers can be set to &quot;direct color&quot; (a constant BBGGGRRR palette). This &quot;direct color&quot; alone nearly equals anything that can be done with the Genesis. But then you can do color addition between a direct color layer and a 16-color layer with a BBGR palette. Or did we already rule that out pages ago?
