If the level design manages to silently guide you on your way without explicitly/openly telling you instructions, i think that's perfect. But arrows and button instructions are decidedly the more sureproof way.

I can't really think of an elegant way to imply that &quot;holding down changes the behaviour of the A button but only in certain contexts&quot;, especially when pressing down normally does nothing in this game.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Thanks for the feedback so far !<br /><br />First of all, this was my very first attempt at level designing, so I knew that it wouldn't be perfect, especially that 'drop down' part ...<br />I wanted to add an arrow, or a sign to read with instructions, but I ran out of space and time. So I guess I just done it the lazy way...<br /><br />Sprite flickering is clearly noticeable in the game.<br />I could test what rainwarrior said to lighten the effect, but as a lot of stuff happens aligned with the dragon, there will always be glitches somehow.<br /><br />@FrankenGraphics : I really like your example for the DOWN+A action, and your advice for the jumps over the spikes with the low ceiling. I sure will update this after the compo results.

When is the right time to present a scene where the maneuver is mandatory, <em>if ever</em>?<br /><br />As said, down+jump follows a fairly established convention, so for the main segment of the user group, i suspect the difficulty arising is simply becoming aware that the game includes such a maneuver. Visual cues like hard-to-reach bonuses is one way; it guides the player towards being experimental/creative with the control pad. Adding a duck feature/animation is another, because that shows the game is aware of downward d-pad presses. That doesn't do it on itself, but is enabling the player do discover the control scheme in minute portions that's easy to bite.<br /><br />The game <em>shovel knight</em> doesn't do the former. While it repeats opportunities to try both the shoveling and pogo jump mechanic, it has a sharp tutorial element requiring the pogo interaction in one place in order to progress on the second board of the first level. Instead they call for the player to induct that there's soft earth + player character is using a shovel = ???, which works about as well. That's a third approach. All three can be combined in a best case scenario.<br /><br />(shovel knight also has a second approach to moving platforms: instead of easing in and out of turning poins, they have the background tiles telegraph how far the platform will go).

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Gesture #2 and #3 share having a security latch so you don't do it by mistake (dropping down on a bullet, enemy, or deadly pit by mistake). Maybe #4 is partly in this category, too. Though, in super smash, speed is more important than full platforming security, so that makes sense. I haven't tested kirby super star. But i think scheme #1 and #4 is fine in games without one- or even two-hit deaths. <br /><br />For the second boss in twin dragons, i think #1 and #4 would mean potential trouble.
