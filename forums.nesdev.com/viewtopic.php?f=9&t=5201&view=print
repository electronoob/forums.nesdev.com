		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Hi,
<br />
<br />Some AVE cartridges use a lockout-defeating chip developed by Macronix, marked MX8018-0002-A. Kevin Horton's site has pics of some boards:
<br /><a href="http://www.tripoint.org/kevtris/mappers/ave/nina-03.html" class="postlink">http://www.tripoint.org/kevtris/mappers/ave/nina-03.html</a>
<br /><a href="http://www.tripoint.org/kevtris/mappers/ave/mb_91_a.html" class="postlink">http://www.tripoint.org/kevtris/mappers/ave/mb_91_a.html</a>
<br />
<br />How compatible are carts which use the MX8018-0002-A chip with late-model front-loading consoles? (If testing an AVE cart you'll have to open it up to ensure it contains the Macronix chip; some AVE carts contain different lockout-defeating circuitry.)
<br />
<br />Operation of the Macronix chip is probably described in one of their US patents, number 5004232. You can view that on (for example) the Espacenet site: <a href="http://v3.espacenet.com/publicationDetails/biblio?adjacent=true&amp;KC=A&amp;date=19910402&amp;NR=5004232A&amp;DB=EPODOC&amp;locale=en_EP&amp;CC=US&amp;FT=D" class="postlink">http://v3.espacenet.com/publicationDetails/biblio?adjacent=true&amp;KC=A&amp;date=19910402&amp;NR=5004232A&amp;DB=EPODOC&amp;locale=en_EP&amp;CC=US&amp;FT=D</a>
<br />(Click the Original Document tab, then the Save Full Document link to download the patent in PDF format.)
<br />
<br />The patent envisages the lockout-defeating circuitry being integrated in the PRG ROM chip (which makes sense because Macronix made mask ROMs), but I guess they never did that, making a separate chip instead.
<br />
<br />Kevin thought the chip was a microcontroller, but its circuitry may be much simpler than that. Quoting from the patent: "It can be seen from FIG. 1 how simple the security circuit can be made: a pair of digital counters, a pulse generator, a clock dividing circuit, two simple gates and a capacitor."
<br />
<br />Since the circuit doesn't use negative voltage to stun the CIC in the console, I'd be interested to hear whether it works in late-model consoles. (The patent was filed in 1989.)
<br />
<br />If it <em>does</em> work in all NES consoles, implementing that circuit could reduce the cost of making things like the PowerPak cart, since the lockout-defeat logic could be integrated into the FPGA rather than needing a separate chip.

<br />
<br />It's interesting that it says that, because the NINA-001 PCB doesn't use the MX8018, but instead uses a rather large 24-pin chip like seen <a href="http://bootgod.dyndns.org:7777/profile.php?id=221" class="postlink">here (chip U3)</a>.
<br />
<br />But now take a look at this <a href="http://bootgod.dyndns.org:7777/profile.php?id=1081" class="postlink">one</a>, which is even bigger, 28-pin, and has the very ROM-like part # of 23C1033.
<br />
<br />And finally, <a href="http://bootgod.dyndns.org:7777/profile.php?id=1241" class="postlink">take a look at this one</a>, what's sitting in spot U1!?
<br />
<br />I hope I still have that second cart, now I wanna pull that chip out and try reading it as if it was a ROM....

<br />
<br />And there's the part that makes the patent completely useless.  Like the Nintendo CIC patent there is not enough information included to actually make a working device.
<br />
<br />On a side note the CIC can't go in a device like an FPGA because the FPGA starts out unprogrammed when the NES powers up.  There isn't enough time to program the FPGA before the CIC has already failed.

This specific patent appears to have expired in 1995 due to non-payment of maintenance fee; click the "INPADOC legal status" tab on the Espacenet page for the patent.<br /><br />Update: You can confirm that on the USPTO web site. Go <a href="https://ramps.uspto.gov/eram/patentMaintFees.do" class="postlink">here</a> and enter 5004232 for Patent Number, 07421164 for Application Number, then click "Get Bibliographic Data".

So it looks like at least some carts have a combined ROM and CIC defeat chip. Looking at the board pics, NINA-001 REV. A has space for a 32-pin IC where the 24-pin chip is fitted. Have you traced the layout of the U3 pins on that board? If you dumped those carts, did the amount of data correspond with there being an additional ROM chip on the board?
<br />
<br />It does seem a bit strange though. For the Impossible Mission II with NINA-001 REV. A board, the 23C1033 part number (and chip size) suggests it's a 1Mbit ROM, which definitely doesn't tally with the game size.
<br />
<br />If the U3 chip <em>is</em> a ROM, the only thing I can think of (and it seems unlikely) is that AVE had a load of spare ROM/CIC-defeat chips, maybe from older titles that didn't sell well? But then, why wouldn't they just use a combined ROM/CIC-defeat for the main PRG ROM???

<br />Using a cpld over the ciclone would be useless though. Unless this also works on snes.

<br />
<br />But still interesting, if someone with hardware knowledge feels like experimenting with it. Maybe a future flash cart could use a CPLD instead of FPGA, in which case a little money could be saved on the CIC hardware. Or maybe a future rev of something like the ReproPak MMC1 board.
<br />
<br />I'd guess that the Macronix method (if it even works with late-model NES consoles) wouldn't work for the SNES; Nintendo would surely have been aware of that patent and made sure it wouldn't work for the SNES.
