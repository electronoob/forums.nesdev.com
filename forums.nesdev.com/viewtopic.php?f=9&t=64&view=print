		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />It is a common statement that Nintendo manufactured all the cartridges and ROM memory boards for the NES.  This statement is mostly true.  However, Konami supplied Nintendo with boards for many of its more popular games, while Nintendo handled the rest.  They use 6-digit codes.  However, some of the games also use Nintendo boards as well, which leads me to believe that Konami supplied its boards to avoid shortages and eliminate surplus ROMs.  
<br />
<br />351258: UNROM
<br />351298: UNROM
<br />351908: SLROM
<br />352026: TLROM + LS32
<br />
<br />I have also seen a Konami UNROM board with a LS02, (Metal Gear) presumably to eliminate bus conflicts.  There is no board name visible on the board.  
<br />
<br />Acclaim also produced both boards and cartridge shells late in the Nintendo's life, and their boards use five digit codes.  The cartridges contain somewhat different looking warning labels on the back.  The PCBs are marked as Acclaim and lookquite different from Nintendo's.  
<br />
<br />51555: TLROM
<br />54425: AOROM
<br />55741: MC-ACC + LS08
<br />53361: MC-ACC
<br />56504: NROM-128
<br />
<br />It is interesting that Acclaim used what is essentially a TLROM board with a Nintendo MMC3 for one game (Smash TV) and the MC-ACC for a bunch of others.  All the MC-ACC games use mapper 4, and all of them came out later than Smash T.V.  Probably Acclaim convinced Nintendo to allow it to use its own hardware as Nintendo's own factories were busy churning out Super Nintendo hardware and games in return for supporting the NES during its lean years.  Or perhaps the MC-ACC is not a true clone of the MMC3 but like Tengen' MIMIC-1 chip (also used in Nintendo's D series of boards) only implements some of the MMC3's functionality.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I have news.  The 56504 cart, supposed to be used in Namco's rare version of Pac-Man, is not used.  Namco's Pac-Man uses a regular NROM-128 in my cart.  However, I also have acquired an Overlord cart.  My Overlord cart has the number 56504 right below the SN1-ROM designation.  It is a custom board that looks just like the Acclaim boards, but it nd the cartridge shell were manufactured by Virgin Games.  Apparently it is the only one they did themselves.  As far as I can tell it should work identically to SNROM.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />There is an easy way to tell if a given Konami cart has a Konami board in it. Flip the cart over and look for a printed "24" on the upper left corner of the back label. This particular plant printed the number rather than embossing it in the label like the others.
<br />
<br />As for knowing which ones have Acclaim boards, below the back label, there is that engraved rectangle that usually says "Nintendo" in it, but these ones will have the Acclaim logo.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />That's very interesting to me because I was under the impression that Nintendo did all the Nintendo official boards at least.  When a non Nintendo mapper is used, is the board by Nintendo too?  Is Famicom Castlevania III on a Nintendo made board?  
<br />
<br />I recently opened up a copy of bubble bobble and one of the chips says taito on it.  It wasn't only odd to me that one of them was manufactured with taito's name on it, but that only one of the two was by taito (don't remember which was PRG and which was CHR at the moment).

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Generally speaking, Nintendo-made boards are only used with Nintendo-made mappers - its various discrete setups (AxROM, BxROM, CxROM, GxROM, UxROM) and the MMC1-MMC6 (SxROM, PxROM, TxROM, FxROM, ExROM, HxROM).
<br />In addition, licensed NES games (NOT Famicom games) using non-Nintendo mappers (the only known ones being the Namco[t] 118 and Sunsoft FME-7) were released on Nintendo-made boards (DxROM and JxROM).
