<br />
<br />I notice the Ganbare Goemon 2 rip has the same problem in Notsofatso. Thanks for the illegal opcodes suggestion though as it seems to work fine. 
<br />
<br />Its been a little while but here are some other nsf suggestions if anyone wants to do them.
<br />
<br />Shin 4 Nin Uchi Mahjong - Yakuman Tengoku - One of the few games by Nintendo left that doesn't have a rip
<br />
<br />Ginga Denshou - Galaxy Odyssey - An FDS game. It plays very similar to Super Star Force. Has an excellent sounding title screen.
<br />
<br />Bio Miracle Upa cart version - Although the music doesn't sound as good as its FDS counterpart, I do like the way some of it sounds. 
<br />
<br />Mach Rider - I think this game needs to be rensfed. Tracks 4 and 5 which both play the level theme sound screwy on the current one. 
<br />
<br />Rush n Attack/Green Beret (FDS) - Current rip is missing 3 songs, ending theme, game over theme, and underground. It seems to only be possible to get to the underground segement in Green Beret as it was apparently removed from Rush N Attack. (Blow up a mine and if a ladder appears climb down it.)

<br />Uhh, are you sure about that? I had Bases Loaded 2 nsf in my colly before (granted, it's 24kB vs yours 7, but it has two more subsongs). But for the life of me I can't say where I got it from...
<br />
<br />Still, the other rips are mighty fine (and I seem to have not noticed that you put Deep Dungeons 1 in there). Great job. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I ended up ripping all 4 Bases Loaded NSF files. I don't make significantly optimized rips, because I both don't know how, and have seen the effect of over-optimizing a rip when trying to add missing music to it.
<br />
<br />I added all the NSFs from my main page to the list I'm keeping, and updated all the page info, except the one divided into A-Z file pages.
<br />
<br />I also added WWF King of the Ring. If you actually play this game, you should check the NSF for missing music, because there is the slightest bit of question in my mind as to whether I got it all or not.

<br />Thanks for ripping Galaxy Odyssey. Unfortunately I haven't made any real progress in that game either, so I couldn't tell you if anything is missing at the moment.

The two more subsongs are probably just sound effects. Nevertheless, I'm removing mine, since his came earlier.
