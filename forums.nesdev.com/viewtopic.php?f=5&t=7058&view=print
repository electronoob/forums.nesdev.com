		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Since Youtube videos still get the most publicity and a few people here use this platform, I thought I'd share my approach to encoding game footage.
<br />I don't claim it's the best way to achieve high quality. In fact, it most likely isn't and it all comes down to personal preference anyway.
<br />
<br />
<br />First of all, I capture gameplay with the emulator's built-in AVI recording (FCEUX in this case, Nestopia kept failing on me and I didn't try Nintendulator). The video will have a resolution of 256x224 if recorded using NTSC emulation (256x240 for PAL, Nestopia always outputs 256x240 it seems).
<br />Then I call MEncoder, which comes with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MPlayer" class="postlink">MPlayer</a>, from the command line with the following parameters:
<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">mencoder in.avi -o out.avi -ovc lavc -lavcopts vcodec=mpeg4:mbd=1:vbitrate=8000 -ofps 30 -vf scale=512:448,expand=640:480 -sws 4 -oac mp3lame -lameopts vbr=2:q=2:aq=0:mode=1:lowpassfreq=19700</div><br />This will double the base video's size (-vf scale=512:448) using the nearest neighbour algorithm (-sws 4), so the pixels will remain crisp and clean. Then, black borders get added (expand=640:480) to fit the native size of Youtube's player. This ensures Youtube won't apply any further resizing, and hence blurring, to the image. Also, our video will get the 480p tag which will use higher video and audio bit rates and can improve overall quality.<br /><br />Unfortunately, MPEG4 seems to be the best(?) codec MEncoder supports for this purpose (it's well-accepted by Youtube). It is quite lossy, so be sure to choose a high bit rate, especially when there's a lot of things going on in the video (waterfalls in MM2/Bubble Man Stage come to mind).<br />The downside is that the produced files will get rather large.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93ZU21IpBLM&amp;hd=1" class="postlink">Test video (MEncoder)</a><br /><br />Not the worst quality, but <strong>be sure to watch it in the large player</strong>.<br />However, the 30fps limit is still bothering me. Fluency suffers a lot from it. Also notice how Mario becomes invisible when he gets hit due to his flickering at 30fps.<br /><br /><br />So, the other day, after a lot of googling, I came up with an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AviSynth" class="postlink">AviSynth</a> script that converts 60fps to 30fps video by blending odd and even frames together.<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">function BlendFrames &#40;clip video&#41;<br />&#123;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;v = assumefieldbased&#40;video&#41;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;out = layer&#40;v, trim&#40;v, 1, 0&#41;, &quot;fast&quot;&#41;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; out = ChangeFPS&#40;out,30&#41;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;assumeframebased&#40;out&#41;<br />&#125;<br /><br />directshowsource&#40;&quot;enctest.avi&quot;&#41;<br />ConvertToRGB32&#40;&#41;<br />BlendFrames&#40;&#41;</div>
<br /><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDQkvFLYHoQ&amp;hd=1" class="postlink">Test video with frame blending (AviSynth+MEncoder)</a>
<br />
<br />Now Mario effectively becomes transparent when hit and sprite movement in BladeBuster looks pretty smooth.
<br />Scrolling can get kind of mushy, though. I think it works best for old arcade-style games with plain backgrounds.
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />If you have any improvements or other/better methods, feel free to post them!
<br />
<br />Also, what would be a good (60fps-)alternative to Youtube if, for example, all you want to do is embed a video in your blog?

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I too use Avisynth to help reformat emulator video into something VDub can encode with Xvid, although I use a slightly different method to do the 60-to-30 blurring: <a href="http://avisynth.org/mediawiki/Select" class="postlink">SelectEven/SelectOdd</a> followed by <a href="http://avisynth.org/mediawiki/Overlay" class="postlink">Overlay</a> at opacity 0.5. If you're using animated subtitles, as I did for one of my own videos, make sure to add them before the motion blur so that they get blurred too.
<br />
<br />But to give an accurate impression of the NES's non-square pixels, you need to start with the 256x240 pixel clip and then do this:
<br />
<br /><a href="http://avisynth.org/mediawiki/AddBorders" class="postlink">AddBorders</a>(14, 0, 10, 0) # add a bit of hblank to make it 280x240, slightly offcenter to the right like the NES signal
<br /><a href="http://avisynth.org/mediawiki/Resize" class="postlink">BilinearResize</a>(320, 240) # restore pixel aspect ratio
<br />
<br />If you care about sharp pixel edges when the video is viewed in 480p, you can blow it up before correcting pixel aspect ratio:
<br />
<br />AddBorders(14, 0, 10, 0)
<br /><a href="http://avisynth.org/mediawiki/Resize" class="postlink">PointResize</a>(560, 480)  # make the pixels twice as big with sharp edges
<br />BilinearResize(640, 480)
<br />
<br />And if you're using subtitles, be careful of whether you add them before or after the resize operation.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Thanks tepples, I didn't even stumble upon these functions. AviSynth is one hell of a tool, a few hours are definitely not sufficient to learn enough of it.
<br />
<br />I'm always torn between the crisp pixel look (=integral scaling values, Nearest Neighbour-resize, the pixel artist in me likes that) and the accurate look (=correct aspect ratio, possibly even with blargg's NTSC filter enabled).
<br />
<br />I guess it doesn't matter too much as long as you don't stretch your emulator videos to a 16:9 ratio just to fill the player as some people do. Probably the same kind of people that hates black borders and hits the zoom/stretch button on their tv remote whenever a show in 4:3 starts. It does make skinny actresses more bearable, I must admit. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />
<br />
<br /><div class="quotetitle">tokumaru wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">I use a lossless codec</div>
<br />That's great! Back when I tried I couldn't find a lossless codec that worked well with Youtube. I'll definitely need to check that DOSBox one out.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />The 30fps thing always bugged me about youtube. But, if you upload HD 60p footage, it do some sort of smart frame drop (not just an every other drop to get 30p). But it's still not that great. Shmups and the like, tend to have bullets/projectiles that existing in interleaved frame format. So viewing as 30p frame drop, you miss half of those type of bullets, etc.
<br />
<br /> I experimented with capturing at 60p, and down converting to 30p with avisynth via frame blending style. But with a twist. I add an oscillation to the process, so that you can see the blinking stuff still. It just won't appear solid transparent. Here's an example: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbljxwgyKOw">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbljxwgyKOw</a><!-- m --> It's not perfect, but for shmups I think it works fairly decent as an alternative.

<br />Seriously? Because of one lousy video site that might not even exist in a couple of years (or change its policy towards 60fps videos as internet gets faster)?
<br />
<br />Just concentrate in making the best game possible, because that will be your legacy, not a couple of stupid playthrough videos people will post online.

<br />True, but I think that a lossless codec would be better than x264, which AFAIK is meant primarily for real-life images, right?
<br />
<br />I'm pretty sure I used <a href="http://wiki.multimedia.cx/index.php?title=DosBox_Capture_Codec" class="postlink">this codec</a> in the past with great success. I'm not sure if you can download just the codec or if you need to install DOSBox first, but if you do install DOSBox you can just go to its program group and install the codec from there.
<br />
<br />EDIT: I just checked, you can open the DOSBox installer with an archiver (I used 7-Zip) and get the video codec from it. Then you just need to right-click the .inf file and select "install". DOSBox is a pretty useful program to have installed though.

<br />Yeah, I actually checked that same page yesterday but couldn't find a VFW codec from anywhere. I thought DosBox might have the encoder internally, but I'm glad to see it's VFW DLL. I already had DOSBox installed, it's in the DOSBox installation directory under "zmbv" if anybody else needs it. The .inf is also there. (EDIT: should have read your message better: yes, it can be installed from the program group also)
<br />
<br />And it shows up in Nestopia too! Thanks! <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />
<br />
<br />Too bad there's apparently no way to compress audio with Nestopia.
