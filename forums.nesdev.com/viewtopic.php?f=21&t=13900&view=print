		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />You'll have to debug the game to find out how this information is stored. A good starting point would be to see where in the OAM the relevant sprites are, and then set up a breakpoint for these specific slots in the shadow OAM (the page in RAM that gets copied to OAM by a sprite DMA).<br /><br />Then, by looking at the code, you'll be able to see how the OAM entries are formed, and where sprie attributes and pattern indices come from. Hopefully it will be something straightforward, uncompressed data straight off the ROM, but it could also be coming from RAM, meaning it has been previously decompressed from ROM, in which case you'd have to set a breakpoint for that memory range, and keep going until you find where this data comes from.

I see the Trace Logger, but I don't know how to read the data that comes from that.</div><br />Open the CPU debugger an pause the CPU (click &quot;step into&quot;). Now open the trace logger and select &quot;log to file&quot; (I find it easier to use a proper text reader to view the fine than that awkward window), then click the &quot;start logging&quot; button. Now go back to the CPU debugger and set up the breakpoint for $0200-$02ff and click &quot;run&quot;. I clicked &quot;run&quot; a few more times to catch a few writes to the OAM, so I could get a better overview of the process. Once you think you have enough just stop logging and open the file in a text editor. The are messages indicating where the breakpoints happened. I just did this and noticed a few things about Hogan's Alley:<br /><br />1 - The X and Y coordinates come directly from a table, probably reused for all characters, and offsets are added to them so the sprites can move around the screen. The resulting Y coordinate is then decremented by 1, probably to compensate for sprites being delayed by 1 scanline.<br />2 - The attributes are read from ROM through a pointer at memory location $12. This pointer is probably changed for each character, so you have to see where it points to when the game is drawing the character you want to change and that will probably be the table you're looking for.<br />3 - The tile index also comes from the table pointed by $12, but it's read beforehand and goes through some processing before being written to the final location. Some values appear to have special meanings too (maybe things like &quot;end of line&quot;?).<br /><br />So yeah, pay attention to $12 and try to see where it points to when the character you want to change is being processed. There you'll probably find a table of alternating tile indices and attributes.

I hit 'step into' until I found one, went to the address in rom, and was happy to find that changing it did what I was looking for. But... I saw that changing one tile would also change subsequent tiles next to it that shared the same palette, but I've played that game before and was able to configure it the way I needed (&amp; with exactly the same number of bytes, thankfully).
