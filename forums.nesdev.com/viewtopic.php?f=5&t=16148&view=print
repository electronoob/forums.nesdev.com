But the game remained black while NTSC games still worked.<br />So, simply breaking off the plastic that prevents the cartridge from entering wouldn't help.<br /><br />Also, I don't want to mod the console (disabling the lockout chip or whatever).<br /><br />And it doesn't need to be able to play the game with 50 Hz. I simply want my SNES to treat the game as if it was an NTSC game.<br /><br />What's the best way here?

If this is the case with a certain game, then so be it. But in the moment it's the plain task of putting a PAL cartridge into an NTSC SNES and get it to boot. Whatever software-sided issue might appear because the programmer included a lock or because the game doesn't work due to relying on PAL's longer vblank etc., that's to be seen on a game by game basis.

I don't think any of them has a CIC inside, and CIC is the only thing preventing things from running other than software level incompatibility. Integrated CIC or &quot;borrowed&quot; from another cartridge won't make a difference.

The &quot;Fire SNES game converter&quot; that I got has no plastic where the stoppers are in USA SNES cartslot and will fit and the Datel thing has slots in same places as real USA game carts so it will also fit in the slot of a USA SNES.

This is extremely useful, as many games will have software insered to them that refuses to run the game if it's in the wrong region. This is independant on whether the game actually runs on the wrong region or not - countrary with the NES this is hardly a problem with SNES.<br /><br />For example PAL Donkey Kong Country will refuse to run if the PPU registers reads back as NTSC. Japanese game &quot;Live a Live&quot; only runs if the PPU registrs reads back as &quot;NTSC&quot;. I don't know other exaples by heart but there's probably a lot. So in my case, <strong>I have to run &quot;Live a Live&quot; with the adapter, even if I run it on my Power Pak which has a PAL cic.</strong> On the other hand <strong>I have to run &quot;Donkey Kong&quot; (PAL) without an adapter, even though I run a PAL cartridge on a PAL NES</strong> (I just leave the adapter for convenience because it's annoying to remove it - for most games it doesn't change a thing).

You know the two short additional edge connectors on each side of the standard one. The linked Honeybee adapter has them, though. That's the kind you want.<br /><br />On top of that, there is of course the 50/60hz difference, as with NES which can potentially cause some games to behave wrong, though I haven't ever actually seen an example of that. A lot of games do a built in check though, and refuse to start if you're running at the &quot;wrong&quot; refresh rate. You can always just start those in one and then switch to the other though, if you have modded a switch on your SNES.<br />This is the solution I use personally - I don't have a region mod on my console, but I do have a 50/60hz switch, and use it in combination with my passive adapter.<br /><br />ONE MORE THING, though, I have come across exactly one game that refused to work with a regular passive adapter like the ones discussed in this thread. That jap-only Godzilla fighting game. I can make only make it work on a PAL console using an Action Replay 3. I think Super Mario RPG may have the same issue, but I always played that on my NTSC console, so I can't confirm or deny. I think this may be irrelevant to you though. I've never heard of any PAL game giving the same issue on NTSC consoles. Though it's pretty uncommon to even try it, so it might be unknown territory.<br /><br />Finally, the best &quot;catch-all&quot; solution is the &quot;Super CIC&quot; custom chip you can mod into your SNES, it works without switches and automatically detects the correct region for the carts you insert.
