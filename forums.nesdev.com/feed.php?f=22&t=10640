Well, I don't know if &quot;truncated ROM&quot; is really a problem you need to address, that's just something I happened to try in this case due to misunderstanding, but maybe something similar could arise from e.g. a board without a working bank switch or otherwise miswired ROM? ...or maybe not worth worrying about?<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">tepples wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"><br />...whether it'd be practical to limit the size of the test's PRG ROM to 16K so that it can be duplicated into all 16K banks to ensure that a message is displayable even for a truncated ROM.<br /></div><br />Hmm, well, eyeballing it with shiru's space checker it looks like there's only about 8k of stuff in the ROM at the moment.

Well, maybe I wouldn't suggest that particular text. I don't know if anyone else would do what I did, because my <em>actual</em> problem was just that I failed to edit the M0 ROM's header correctly. (My fault for not verifying the hex, or for not interpreting FCEUX's crash correctly, or maybe nes2edit's fault for not displaying the &quot;NES 2.0&quot; flag.) I only started trying to adapt the M34 ROM because that attempt had failed.<br /><br />What I think would be more helpful is just to say a version of something you said to me earlier in this thread, something like:<br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"><br />All PRG-ROMs of any given size are the same. Otherwise they differ only by iNES header and the presence of CHR-ROM.<br /></div><br />I think saying that is a lot simpler and addresses the point of putting this ROM on various mappers to see what it will do, which is exactly why I wanted to use it in the first place.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"><br />However, you can't chop off the end of a larger ROM and use that on a smaller ROM, as it will be missing the special tag that identifies it as the last bank of the ROM. This is intentional in order to prevent builds with disconnected upper address lines from silently working.<br /></div><br />So, as above, I don't think it's very useful to say this specifically, but also because this text just raises another question for me:<br /><br />Why do you <em>want</em> to produce a morse-code-only error when you <em>could</em> produce one that displays diagnostic text as well? The choice isn't really between &quot;silently working&quot; and &quot;morse code error only&quot;, is it?<br /><br />It's a very onerous way to diagnose an error-- and that's why I was making the suggestion to put the actual morse code in the documentation (instead of making it <em>even more onerous</em> by requiring users to look up a morse code table as well). Shouldn't it only be used as a very last resort?<br /><br />Or to put it a different way: this ROM does many useful tests at once, most of which are independent, but here you seem to state that this one test result has veto power on all the others. This is why I wanted to use it in the first place: I knew it could test for the presence of PRG-RAM and CHR-RAM, so I thought it would be a good/easy way to test various emulators' response to different headers.<br /><br /><br />Anyhow, that's just a suggestion, not a demand or anything. It already works fine, and it's certainly acceptable and useful the way it is.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=5165">rainwarrior</a> — Mon Oct 16, 2017 2:55 pm</p><hr />

There's no urgency to any answer. I'm just giving feedback because you asked why I was confused by the error.<br /><br />I was just wrongly expecting all the banks to be the same except for bank numbers, so I thought any bank would be fine for booting up. I didn't think all the custom ROMs for various boards were going to be putting different stuff in each bank.<br /><br />I was not trying iNES 2 headers, only setting CHR-ROM size to 0 to specify CHR-RAM, i.e.<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">4E 45 53 1A 02 00 01 08 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00</div><br /><br />On second look the crash is actually FCEUX's fault, so don't worry about that. nintendulator rejects it as a bad header, and puNES accepts it as 0 = 8k CHR-RAM where it runs OK. Didn't run into the same crash with the modified M34 ROM because that header was already iNES 2 to begin with, apparently.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=5165">rainwarrior</a> — Sun Oct 15, 2017 8:22 pm</p><hr />

Sort of related request: does WB have to be a hard fail instead of just a diagnostic message? Is it not valid to run this on a discrete mapper board?<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=5165">rainwarrior</a> — Sun Oct 15, 2017 6:42 pm</p><hr />

<div class="quotetitle">tepples wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"><br />How much more does, say, the Action 53 mapper cost compared to a plain old UOROM (161+32)?<br /><br />How much does it cost to level-shift each pin?<br /></div><br /><br />Action53 multimapper with 512KB of PRG-ROM still fits in a smaller CPLD, so it's more cost effective to still use a smaller 5v-tolerant CPLD.  It used 27 macrocells in the XC9536XL.  My plan would be to migrate it to use A 32 macrocell lattice M4A3 or isp4000V series CPLD that are close to $1.26 which is comparable to the Xilinx XC9536XL used thus far.  So the concerns of level shifting each pin aren't an issue.  <br /><br />The parts cost between a discrete mapper and the CPLD and 3v supply is around $1.50.  There is added labors involved with CPLDs compared to discrete mappers though too, but I've tried to keep those minimal for Action53 doing most the work myself.<br /><br />For a more complex mapper on par with the MMC3/FME7 (effectively something with an IRQ counter and/or fine CHR banking) and beyond that would now make more sense to put in a non-5v tolerant CPLD the cost per level shift would most likely be grouped by 16bits at a time.<br /><br />FME7, fits perfectly in 16bits, where MMC3 comes goes one bit over with the addition CPU A0<br />(8) PRG-DATA<br />(3) PPU A10-12<br />(3) CPU A0, A13-14<br />(3) control (PRG R/W PRG /CE M2)<br />17 bits total.  <br /><br />I'm toying with the idea of using a voltage divider for something like CPU A0, but I'd have to do some thorough testing before that sat well with me.  There are smaller options for 4-8bit level shifters, but I'd rather not hassle with them for stocking reasons. EDIT: I guess there are single bit levelshifters under 10cents in qty..<br /><br />Once pushed to the point of needing two level shifters there are added benefits since you'd get the whole CPU bus down to 3v.  Now you're no longer restricted to 5v memories for WRAM/PRG-ROM.  So super cheap 4-8MByte 3v TSOP-44 flash becomes attractive if you can stomach the finer pitch that comes with them.  That and the cost of 5v sram/flash has been on the rise some of mine have even been EOL recently as well.<br /><br />The actual cost of level shifters is greatly dependent on quantity purchased, but $0.50/16bits is prob the best number to use I'd say.  There are added assembly costs as well to consider.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=4832">infiniteneslives</a> — Sun Aug 23, 2015 4:26 pm</p><hr />
