<br />
<br />The unfortunate reality of the internet is, we will always have people looking for an easy way out looking for someone willing to do the work for them. Even if there was a wiki or visual site dedicated to reproducing carts from cannibalized donors we would still have people come and ask I soldered A-B and never got C what did I do wrong.
<br />So if we had that visual instruction site with detailed pictures and instructions for the lazy (maybe cut out any theory but add a troubleshooting guide) then there would be sufficient reason for a Mod to lock a thread at the instant the questions are asked and a referral to said instruction page.
<br />As for those who whine bitch and condemn those who come here for help on touchy subjects, quit wasting your time energy and sanity on these people and put your minds together and create this instruction site to rid yourselves of this annoyance.

<br />
<br />Maybe so, but you were not the direct target of my rant. 
<br />
<br />So I will use this as an "example" not attack to you, this reply you made could come across as being somewhat abrasive and being that your name was not mentioned in my rant can be interpreted in a negative way.
<br />
<br />We all have our opinions on all matters, maybe we can use this as an example of when to silence our opinion and just tolerate that its out of our control. I'm sure it would cut a huge percent of the negativity we see corroding our forums. Some of the people here just need to practice a little self control.
<br />
<br />We also have to understand that our forums are international and some things are lost in translation including the context of what we say. We may think we are contributing by voicing our opinion, but a couple of misused words or grammar is interpreted as an attack. 
<br />
<br />Peace Love and NES

<br />
<br />This is not entirely accurate (nor fair).  There are other reasons/aspects too which have nothing to do with Bregalad.  The only person here who knows what those are is me, since I've been in contact with blargg.
<br />
<br />I would love to provide more details of the problems, but cannot out of respect for blargg (same for anyone else on this forum, just for the record; I don't want to sound like I'm giving blargg special treatment or something).
<br />
<br />This situation should not result in a witch-hunt.

Don't take that the wrong way, I'm not telling you to leave or shut up or anything.  You make great contributions all the time.  I just notice that when negative things are said that you have often been involved in the past (for whatever that's worth, on this relatively slow moving board).  Sometimes I read the things you post directed at others and I just think "geez, who cares, let the guy do whatever he wants."<br /><br />I hope this doesn't lead to ganging up on Bregalad or anything, just what I've seen at times.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">tokumaru wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">I agree with whoever said that the best policy against threads about subjects you oppose is to just ignore them.

<br />
<br />Yes, this is the best policy.  If you can't say something nice, don't say anything at all.  And there is also a difference between mean statements and polite criticism (which I am trying to attempt here).
<br />
<br />I really do like this forum and everybody on it, and don't understand how these big misunderstandings can happen.  Most of the time nobody's being unfair/overly critical.

<br />
<br />Anyway, I believe the problem isn't blargg. Different opinions I'd say. Unfortunately, a few members seems to enjoy the "rightness of its ego" and fires without mercy.

<br />The percentage of arguments/disagreements/drama is directly proportional to how easy it is for the masses to participate in a discussion, compounded by the number of people participating.  The old nesdev (and SNESdev, for those who remember it -- guys like myself, Gau, Charles Doty, Donald Moore (MindRape), and many others whose names I've sadly forgotten) mailing lists had fewer participants.
<br />
<br />Email lists, generally speaking, have a higher signal-to-noise ratio (e.g. more signal than noise), while public Web forums have a lower SNR.  This isn't always the case (look at the NANOG mailing list sometime -- practically every thread is an argument), but generally speaking it's true.  The reason being: people consider Email more personal (less anonymous), and there's a sense of professionalism when it comes to mailing list participation.  What you say in Email can actually come back to haunt you (professionally) in many cases.  A web forum offers an easier-to-achieve level of anonymity.
<br />
<br />IRC is equivalent to a web forum (and in some regards much worse).  #snes on EFnet still exists, though I don't recognise 90% of the inhabitants.
<br />
<br />The younger generation (born post-1988) tend to prefer web-based everything.  Hello Geocities and MySpace.
<br />
<br />There are trolls on all mediums (IRC being the worst of the bunch) so I'm excluding those -- and those generally aren't a problem here anyway, nor are they part of the reason for blargg not returning here.

<br />
<br />No.  He and I discussed primarily 3 reasons, and two (well more like 1.5) of those are focused around this forum.  They aren't necessarily focused on individuals.  What I took away from our discussion is that the moderation here need to be improved, or at least refined.  That doesn't equate to "more rules", it equates to "when problems occur, try to get to the root of them and solve the issue" (vs. just banning people).
<br />
<br />I think the latter relates to what tepples has applied for quite some time, which is basically sticking to what the <a href="http://www.parodius.com/policies/" class="postlink">Parodius Policy Rulebook</a> goes over, with the (IMHO positive) addition of <a href="http://nesdev.com/bbs/viewtopic.php?t=1961" class="postlink">don't be a dick</a>.
<br />
<br />I'm a continual violator of the latter (which is why I come off sounding stern most of the time :-) ), but as I've gotten older (health problems, personal issues, you name it -- real life stuff) I've resorted to the <a href="http://www.thefreedictionary.com/can%27t+be+bothered" class="postlink">I can't be bothered</a> form of thought.  Don't worry, I still rant/rave daily.  ;-)
