Maybe the cartridge connector was better, but I have some doubts about it.<br />I recently have fixed one of these on <a href="https://forums.nesdev.com/viewtopic.php?f=9&amp;t=15458" class="postlink">this thread</a> and looks like Zepper is trying to fix one <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/viewtopic.php?f=5&amp;t=15229" class="postlink">here</a> too. I really hope he succeeded!!<br /><br />It was told that Gradiente had an contract with Atari, and sold the old VCS here with the brand Polyvox.<br />They were intending to release the 7800 too, but since it has not a stunning succes as the NES, they decided to use the already made molds and clone a NES instead.<br /><br />I also remember calling the CCE controllers the &quot;Batman controllers&quot;.<br />Sometime later the console was shipped with a Batman cartridge with it. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" /> <br /><br />AFAIK all these &quot;heavyweight&quot; manufacturers release their clones because of the market reserve politics, that basically forbid importings and such.

	</div><br />It's a Phantom System cartridge. Yup, a few others remove copyright notices, like Ghostbusters II - they removed the &quot;activision&quot; word from the credits. Other carts are entirely fine with no mods.

As soon as mask protections became a thing, why didn't they immediately apply that to all their chip technologies and start demanding royalties.

From what I can make out, the law was only applicable to mask work that was first commercially exploited on or after July 1, 1983.  Anything prior was potentially still up for grabs.<br /><br />It's really difficult to believe that Nintendo's entire empire originated off a piece of stolen technology.
