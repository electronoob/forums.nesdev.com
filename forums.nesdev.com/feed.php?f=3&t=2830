Hey, can we have this thread back for discussion of the Wii virtual console's accuracy? I'm very interested in reports about it, but not interested in a digression about memory mapper availablity or Konami's custom chips. Thanks.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=17">blargg</a> — Wed Dec 27, 2006 11:01 pm</p><hr />

In reply to <a href="http://nesdev.com/bbs/viewtopic.php?p=20620#20620" class="postlink">this post</a>:<br /><br />I don't think you can call CV3 as a hack. A hack would be to tricky replace all mapper writes by JSR commands so that another routine is called. I think Konami just ported their game to MMC5 mapper for some reason. (Nintendo seems to not allow Konami to use their VRC outise of Japan ? For some reason Sunsoft was able to use their FME-7 for Batman - Return of the Joker).<br />They would have to change the music anyway, or include adaptaters to input on the bottom NES connector, wich I don't think Nintendo allowed either.<br />A lot of other games were ported from older VRCs to UNROM, and some (like Contra) were degraded. However, Konami could use Contra as-is with the MMC3 and very few mapper hack (I did that), instead of downgrading the game and compress graphics to hell to fit a smaller UNROM cart. Or maybe they did just the UNROM version first, and just added cutscenes in the japanese version right before the release ?<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=38">Bregalad</a> — Tue Dec 26, 2006 3:15 am</p><hr />
