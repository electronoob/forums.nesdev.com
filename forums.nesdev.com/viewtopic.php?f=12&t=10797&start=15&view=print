		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Cool. Looked to me as if your original pinout wasn't that wrong. But it's easy to get trapped if the MMX3 cart didn't wire /CE as it should, I would have probably trusted that it's wired properly, too.<br /><br />Okay, /CE1 and /CE2 are swapped... just for curiosity: Does that match up with PCB text layer &amp; ROM chip names? Or are they indicating that the &quot;first&quot; ROM connects to /CE2?<br /><br />Funny that they used GND instead /CE1 for the single-ROM board, but they can do so if there is only one ROM (and no SRAM) on the board. Though that makes me wonder if the ROM is mirrored to the SRAM area in banks 70 and up on the MMX3 board? Theoretically it should be so (unless there is some I/O port for deactivating SRAM reads).<br /><br />Yup, Hi/Lorom select would make sense. Battery sensor might make sense too (so the chip could disable /SRAM when VCC is less than Vbat), dunno if they've took the effort to include such analogue circuitry in the digital Cx4 chip.<br /><br />Since the Cx4 has some on-chip RAM, maybe there's even some way to have that internal memory battery backed (then one of the VCC pins might be actually &quot;Vbat&quot; for internal RAM... I don't remember if you've checked if the VCC pins are interconnected inside of the chip).

Also, /CE1 is /CE for the single-ROM board.  There's a register in the Cx4 to switch out the upper 8Mbit space between single or double ROM, which affects the CE1/CE2 decoding.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">nocash wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">Though that makes me wonder if the ROM is mirrored to the SRAM area in banks 70 and up on the MMX3 board?

I'll have to test it out some time, or byuu might know from his US dumping endeavor.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">nocash wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">I don't remember if you've checked if the VCC pins are interconnected inside of the chip).</div><br />I didn't.  And I don't remember if I checked all of the Gnd pins, or just pins 74 and 75... I don't currently have a chip desoldered, so I can't say at the moment.<br /><br />Once I get the signals traced out, assuming the SRAM /CE just works, I'd like to mod a RMX2 PCB with 16Mbit ROM and 256Kbit SRAM.  We'll see.
