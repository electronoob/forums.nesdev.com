		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />The thread about nostalgic game-related stories got me thinking of my experiences playing games as a kid, so I thought this might be a fun side-topic to that.  And yeah, I'm aware of tvtropes &quot;nightmare fuel&quot; section, but this is for here.<br /><br />Probably the creepiest gaming experience I had was going over to my older cousin's house, who had a Ti99/4A (maybe my first experience with a computer?).  He was telling me about how fun Parsec was, I remember trying it, and thought it was meh.  Then we played <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGVOw8gXl6Y" class="postlink">Hunt the Wumpus</a>, and that seemed mildly scary to me.  I'm pretty sure I never got the Wumpus.  But that was just warming me up for the next game.. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCALI3TdpjY" class="postlink">Microsurgeon</a>.  I became fascinated with it.  As if seeing an inside view of the patient's eyeball, and moving your character around inside their brain wasn't creepy enough, my cousin showed me that the patient can die (IIRC a nurse walks into the room and says something, memory is kinda hazy).  I'm not certain, but I'm pretty sure that was my first exposure to mortality.  So there I was, frantically trying to figure out how to play this relatively complex game, to save this poor bastard from dying in the hospital bed.  That game still creeps me out to this day.  On a somewhat related story, on another visit my cousin wouldn't let me play his Ti99 for whatever reason, and I don't know if he was doing something else to taunt me or what, but apparently it made me mad enough to punch him and bloody his nose.  He was maybe 8 years older than me and was a fairly big dude.  I don't even remember doing that, but my other cousins always reminded me of it, because they thought it was hilarious.  Oh holy shit, thinking about it now, I might be confusing it with another time, but I think he might have been insisting that my sister and I have to watch Mary Poppins.  Instead of video games?  <em>Fuck that.</em>  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_lol.gif" alt=":lol:" title="Laughing" /> <br /><br />I used to play Atari games over at a couple of my friends' house (they were brothers), and they had the game <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LsOMpzlyido" class="postlink">Ghost Manor</a>, and that game seemed really scary to me.  Not much else to say about it, but looking at the video now I can say holy crap, I'm not surprised.  They also had <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiI2yrT5I-o" class="postlink">Porky's</a>, and it seems silly now, but for some reason that white dude that chases you around kinda scared me.  Maybe it's just the relentless way he chases you.  I've never seen the movie it's based on, so I never did (and still don't) have any context to what's going on in that one.<br /><br />On Coleco, Smurfs: Rescue from Gargamel's Castle seemed a little scary to me too.  Maybe it's how the music is all cheerful when you're outside, then you're in a cave with darker music playing and even the jump sound effect changes.  Before long, you're using a human skull as a platform to rescue Smurfette.  I wonder if kids' games are much like that these days, heheh.<br /><br />When I got my NES, I received Ikari Warriors with it, and played the hell out of it.  I soon discovered the ABBA code (probably the easiest cheat code ever), so I was able to play further into the game.  The fact that you can get stuck inside the walls seemed a little disconcerting.  Eventually I made it to the end of the game (or what I thought was the end, it's actually not) where you eventually reach a dead end with.. a gigantic corpse sitting behind a desk.  WTF.  It doesn't do anything, and it didn't seem like you could anything at that point other than sit there and wait to die, or reset the system.  Again, WTF.<br /><br />A friend and I one day discovered the arcade game Chiller, it didn't seem scary though, more like holy shit this is gory and awesome.  Sometime later in a used game store I saw an NES Chiller cart on the shelf, and I had to have it.  So it became the only unlicensed (well, non-Tengen) NES game I owned as a kid.  By that point, I guess I was old enough to where nothing in games really seemed to disturb me.  OK wait, I take that back.  When I rented the game Uninvited, that lady in the fancy dress scared the shit out of me.  Running out of torches in Shadowgate was also kind of intense.<br /><br />Ooh, I guess there is one more too, for SNES.  Drakkhen.  Good god, those things that form out of the constellations in the sky, giant deadly shadow people, and the giant black cat head that shoot lasers from it's eyes, if you bump into those things that I assumed were grave markers or something.  I'm pretty sure Drakkhen was the last game that truly scared me.  I love the music and sfx in that game (coincidentally, IIRC it was done by the same guy who did the soundtrack to Shadowgate and Uninvited).<br /><br />I saved the weirdest for last.  When I was a kid one of the Atari games I was stuck with, was Swordquest Fireworld.  It never seemed scary or anything, just confusing.  Until many years later, when I was maybe 13 or so, and it made an appearance in one of the most bizarre nightmares I ever had.  So in this dream, I was walking in this creek that I always used to play in when I was a kid (Bean Creek, and it now has &quot;Danger: Raw Sewage Overflow&quot; signage around it, but that's Indianapolis for ya), in an area of it that has these steep cliffs on both sides.  Suddenly the cliffs rose up to be much higher, and a huge crab rose out of the water in front of me.  It looked like I was watching this happen on TV, and I yelled out &quot;Oh my god!  It's Samhain!&quot;  Then all at once, <a href="http://youtu.be/_h9Xj0rp65s?t=46s" class="postlink">some &quot;music&quot;</a> from that game started to play, getting increasingly faster and louder as it does in the game, while the crab starts moving towards me while <strong>breathing fire</strong>.  And during all this, Japanese subtitles were appearing at the bottom of the &quot;screen&quot;.  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_eek.gif" alt=":shock:" title="Shocked" />

The reason she's chasing you around has to do with what happens in the film.  I'd rather not give any spoilers, but certain scenes should explain some of what's going on.  (It's not a great movie by any means, but I still remember a few scenes from it).  <a href="http://movieclips.com/6Hqu-porkys-movie-trailer-1/" class="postlink">Here's one of the original trailers</a>, which should give you more than a sufficient idea what the film is about.  (Folks judging should remember it came out in 1982 :P).  Also, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m3Qhrs_Uh1c" class="postlink">AVGN did a small segment on Porky's for the 2600</a> which does disclose why Balbricker is following you (read: movie spoiler).<br /><br />P.S. -- Parts of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbjVffUGjxA" class="postlink">Haunted House for the Atari 2600</a> used to scare the shit out of me (but still played it nonetheless).

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />The game that scared me the most when I was a Kid was <em>Ecco the Dolphin</em> on the Genesis. Looks silly, but I've always been scared of deep sea creatures and fish in general. As Ecco swum down, the water would get darker and darker, and I literally could feel the room getting colder. The levels with prehistoric creatures and aliens certainly didn't make it any easier! The cryptic messages (which were particularly cryptic because I didn't understand english back then) over the animated sea surface were pretty gloomy too.<br /><br />When I read Memblers' stories, I was surprised to see Atari games on his list, but now that I think of it, some aspects imposed by the hardware limitations of the 2600 did create pretty moody environments. The lack of music (no ROM for anything beyond short tunes) deformed or faceless characters (because of the blocky graphics), the black backgrounds (used for contrast against the monochrome objects), all contributed to these weird worlds that could sometimes be considered scary.<br /><br />I remember being reasonably scared by <em>Apples and Dolls</em> on the 2600. Judging by the cover art (my cart was a bootleg, it had no art), I guess it was supposed to be cute, but back when I was 6 I really didn't see it that way. The main character has huge deformed feet, and moves around by shaking his/her hips and making a strange sound, instead of walking like a normal person. The enemies are mindless silent zombies, blindly walking from one side to another. If they catch you, you'll slowly fall to your death, IIRC. Scary shit for a little kid.

I guess Sony made the BIOS really creepy to some.<br /><br />Personally, I was only afraid of water-based levels or segments where you could drown. There's just something wrong with being in tight, confined underwater passages as the game continually reminds you that you're going to die. The Sonic The Hedgehog games were the worst offenders, for obvious reasons. I never played Ecco the Dolphin on the Genesis, but only because I figured the whole game would be like that. Plus, the bosses looked freaky, and I do not like dealing with underwater creatures to begin with.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Well, I kind of have two games that scare me (both equally). They are:<br /><br />1) Donkey Kong Country 2<br />2) Super Mario Bros. 2 (USA)<br /><br />DKC2 is really a dark-themed game. And there are wayyy too many bones in the game as well as ghosts. SMB2 (USA) scares me but I know not why. Probably because it's not a real Mario game. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" alt=":(" title="Sad" /><br /><br />DKC1 is kind of scary but not as bad and World 8 of SMB3 but those aren't listed because they are minor. On the contrary, I really, really enjoy DKC3 and DKL III.  Banjo Kazooie is sort of scary and Metroid and Zelda II onward and Kirby Superstar. But I'm only listing my worst one. (Anything non-Nintendo is basically hair-raising to me, especially PS series and Xbox series.)<br /><br />Well, the above still scares me to this day as a grown man in my 20's. But I'm not ashamed. We all have fears. Some more than others. I was able to hack SMB2 (USA) regardless of my fear of it in the Homebrews section, so I consider that a step forward. --ShaneM, the Master of ASM

At all. For a long time.<br /><br />Then when I got a bit older (third grade, I think), we borrowed a Macintosh, and I got to play a couple of the real ICOM games. Deja Vu always freaked me out because the game over screen featured what looked like a pair of rotting corpses, but Uninvited was, and still is, genuinely frightening in almost every way. It didn't help that, being Mac games, they were completely silent most of the time, and then would startle you with a sudden blast of audio...that skull that followed you around the mansion was the worst, you never knew when it would pop up...and one time, I tried to run away from the computer before it got me, and the noise still startled me, and I lost my balance and ran into a wall &gt;_&lt;

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />It' strange reading these, because I can't relate in the least for when I was younger. I saw 'Heavy Metal' when I was 5, and Poltergeist when I was 6, Conan when I was 8, Alien when I was 9-ish, The Thing when I was 10years old (the 80's version), etc. Stuff like that. I don't ever remember being 'scared' or such when play any video games, especially 8bit and 16bit era. I remember feeling anxiety and anticipation for a <em>couple </em>of games, but mostly cause the enemies were difficult (Dungeons of Daggorath; you could hear the enemies coming by the noises they made, but couldn't see them. It's a maze first person dungeon crawler). Resident Evil 2 is probably the closest to feeling scared, but that's still a bit of a stretch; more like creeped out. I would purposely <em>only </em>play it at midnight, to get the full effect of the game. Same for the Dead Space series.
