I've been doing it in Verilog, and I get the Nintendo logo on my original DMG and Pocket, but then it goes to a blank screen every time. All 32K games like Tetris or Dr Mario work perfectly on a GBA or GBC console, though.<br /><br />Here's my super simple mapper below, where FL_xxx is the flash memory:<br /><br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">module no_mapper(<br /><br />input not_wr, not_rd, not_cs,<br /><br />input&nbsp; &#91;15:0&#93; addr,<br />output &#91;7:0&#93;&nbsp; data,<br /><br />input&nbsp; &#91;9:0&#93;&nbsp; SW,<br />input&nbsp; &#91;3:0&#93;&nbsp; KEY,<br /><br />output &#91;21:0&#93; FL_ADDR,<br />input&nbsp; &#91;7:0&#93;&nbsp; FL_DQ,<br />output &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; FL_OE_N,FL_CE_N,FL_RST_N,FL_WE_N<br />);<br /><br /><br />assign FL_ADDR&nbsp; = {6'b000000,SW&#91;0&#93;,addr&#91;14:0&#93;};<br />assign FL_OE_N&nbsp; = not_rd;<br />assign FL_RST_N = 1'b1;<br />assign FL_WE_N&nbsp; = 1'b1;<br />assign FL_CE_N&nbsp; = addr&#91;15&#93;;<br /><br />assign data&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;= FL_DQ;<br /><br />endmodule<br /></div><br /><br />I've got FL_ADDR[15] wired to a switch, so I can toggle between two 32K games, for testing. <br /><br />The board I'm using is a simple pass-through that connects the pins of the console to a 40-pin IDE header in order to interface with the GPIO pins on the FPGA.<br /><br />Anyone have any ideas of what could be at fault?

Have you tried to research this?  Perhaps something going on differently at boot to detect cart type?  Perhaps it's accessing at different speeds?  How is your setup wired?  Big long wires to a dev board?  These are the types of things I would suspect vs your verilog.  The fact it works on oldies but not new sounds like your biggest clue.

It's working on newer ones, but not older ones.<br /><br />We know that the different generations of game boy use different bootstraps, but I don't know if that's relevant. Maybe it's a voltage level thing? i.e. maybe the original DMG is 5V CMOS and the GBC only requires 3V levels?<br /><br />I'd throw a logic analyzer at the problem to see if I could figure out what was going on.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Yeah it's the other way around. Newer ones work, older ones don't.<br /><br />Could be voltage-level related, as my dev board is running at 3.3V TTL levels, where the console would want 5V TTL (or CMOS? can't recall). Should still be good enough to register a high (1) for TTL/CMOS, though, but it's the only possible thing I can think of if my code isn't the problem. The original DMG and Pocket, as well as GBC all run at the 5V levels natively. I'm using a 6&quot; IDE cable to run between the console and the dev board, so I don't think excessive length is at fault.<br /><br />I was thinking maybe the double-speed mode of the GBC/GBA could be a factor, but that shouldn't really be enabled without the MBC5 running, which I haven't written yet. I've got a basic MBC1 and MBC2 mapper running as well, but neither of those work on the original models either. Again, work fine on the GBC and GBA.

The old ridiculous <a href="https://forums.nesdev.com/viewtopic.php?t=9520" class="postlink">gameboy modem</a> wouldn't work on newer consoles because of that.<br /><br />Have you checked whether the CPU has halted at a specific address when boot fails?

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Krikzz's new Everdrive GB X series had a problem on Gameboy Pockets, it failed to start on them because that system took longer to ramp up to full voltage than the others. The FPGA then failed to initialize itself. It did work on the original DMG, but perhaps yours has a similar issue, just being less tolerant than it.<br /><br />Try your DMG or Pocket with a power adapter.

I wouldn't be surprised if something has broken or behaving weirdly because of this...<br />I looked at the S29GL032 data sheet and couldn't see any obvious problems. Your Xilinx board also works, so this definitely hints at some Altera issues like the maximum voltage rating.<br /><br />I'm not very familiar with Verilog, but I don't see any obvious code that handles putting the GB data pins into high-impedance mode. Is that in some other file or are you always driving the GB data pins?<br />Also, how have you configured the GB pins? Are you using bus hold, pull-up/pull-down resistors or any other special settings? Which IO standard and drive strength settings are you using?<br /><br />PS. If you're curious about the read timings of 1st generation Game Boys, look at this: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://gekkio.fi/files/rubbish/M1.png">https://gekkio.fi/files/rubbish/M1.png</a><!-- m --><br />It describes a fetch cycle but normal reads have the same timing. Data is sampled at T4, RD is not pulsed on each read but chip select (A15 in case of $0000-$7FFF) is.

The plot thickens.</div><br />The fact it was working on some systems showed signs that your code was already working on the DE1.<br /><br />I don't suspect it's related to what's going on here, but something to keep in mind..   Synthesis tools and underlying hardware all differ between vendors.  I've had issues where Lattice diamond will synthesize two completely different things depending on which synthesis tool I select.  That issue seems to be mostly corrected with recent updates.  Anyway, my only real point is here is that &quot;your code&quot; is widely open to interpretation, hdl's are no where near as standardized as languages like C.  Part of this is simply because the underlying hardware varies from one device to another, and things like timing constraints can become a concern.  Any number of things can cause the same hdl code to work on one system, but not another so it's good to keep that in mind.<br /><br />Unfortunately your DE1 board throws a huge wrench into your system that could be the source of a large number of issues.  For reasons like this I typically avoid dev boards and start all projects with a prototype board as close to the end design as I can imagine.  Highly likely a number of things will crop up, or disappear when you migrate between the DE1 and what I assume is the excessively smaller device on your end project.  This is effectively what you're already seeing between the DE1 and xilinx board.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Yeah, I figure it's always better to have a dedicated dev board for each system. But it starts getting to be a nuisance if you have to make any revision changes to the design and have to order more boards. I thought it would be nice to have a dedicated platform that can handle anything I throw at it, and just use pass-through boards. Also saves on assembly time for each prototype.<br /><br />Anyways, I'll play with it some more and report back if I find anything out.<br /><br />Thanks for the pointers so far everyone!
