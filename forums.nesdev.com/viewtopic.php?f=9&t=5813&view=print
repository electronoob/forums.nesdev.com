		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />thanks for the pm answer.  so i check the mapper of holy diver (j) and it said 78.  on retrousb mapper #78 is Good. so i suppose holy diver will work . great.
<br />
<br />you said that its better not playing (E) on a NTSC system. But i suppose i can play (J) japanese one without problem right ? if the mapper is good ?
<br />
<br />thanks for all your help.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />The NES picture is 240 lines tall. The rest of the signal is "vertical blanking", or time for a CRT's electron beam to get from the bottom of the screen back to the top. The NES CPU updates the data that the PPU uses to generate the picture during vblank.
<br />
<br />Japan, North America, and Brazil use a 60 Hz TV signal, which has 262 lines. But most of the rest of the developed world (notably Europe, Australia, and New Zealand) uses 50 Hz and 312 lines. This means the European NES spends a <em>lot</em> more time in vblank, and several Europe-exclusive games will crash or show severe glitches when run at 60 Hz because they are designed for this longer vblank.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I’ve found that it's often better to know *why* something may or may not work, rather than to just assume that it won't at all. There isn’t a definitive yes/no answer to the question on European titles and that's good all-purpose information on PAL video in any case, which may help other people curious on the subject who aren’t experienced with PAL/NTSC scanrates.
<br />
<br />The simplest answer is: ""Some PAL (E) games will run and others won't, and the only way to know for sure is to try and load them."
<br />
<br />I think the PowerPak handles some PAL conversions internally as well, as PAL games I’ve run tend to overscan and don’t scroll or flicker (or do anything usually associated with PAL video on NTSC systems), but if that's the case or not, I've can attest that I’ve played many PAL (E) games on the PowerPak, and it handles them quite nicely. 
<br />
<br />It's certainly not that hard to convert PAL&lt;-&gt;NTSC carts, as there are adapters to do just that (bidirectionally). I can't say that I've had one *crash* on my PowerPak, but I've run into many games, often hacks or obscure titles (and some "popular" games) that load, and then give a solid black display.
<br />
<br />“Arkanoid” is one of them... No version of the “Arkanoid” ROM will load and run properly (for me—if you can get it to work, please let me know). I'm not sure what mapper it uses, but I guess the PowerPak thinks it’s weird or unsupported. 
<br />
<br />I have “Arkanoid” for both the NES and for my Fami, so I can just pull the cart when I want it, but it'd be nice if it ran on the PP as well so that I wouldn’t have to remove it to play that one game, which I do quite often. 
<br />
<br />Back to the original topic, essentially, you won’t hurt anything by running PAL (E) games, so give'em a shot. Either they'll run or not, like any other title, so the worst case scenario is that you'll have to delete non-operational titles from your CF card after testing them.
