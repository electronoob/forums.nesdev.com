I'm a newbie NES programmer and I'm using ASM6 and 6502 assembly.<br /><br />So far, I've done the Nerdy Nights tutorials and am trying my hand at my own game. I've got everything pretty much working and I even managed to integrate the GGSound engine without too much trouble. I added the examples from the <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://wiki.nesdev.com/w/index.php/The_frame_and_NMIs">https://wiki.nesdev.com/w/index.php/The_frame_and_NMIs</a><!-- m --> page but now I have rogue pixels at the top left of my screen and I can't figure out where they're coming from.<br /><br />I've moved the scroll values around and tried turning off the background, palette, sprites, etc. Turning off the palette blanks the screen so it's hard to tell if it's still there.<br /><br /><div class="attachtitle">Attachment:</div><div class="attachcontent">

My first guess is &quot;sprites.spr&quot; is not long enough, or has errors.<br /><br />My second guess is something similar with rogue.nam.<br /><br />The longshot:<br /><br />Behold, the way to draw all the colors on the screen at once: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://wiki.nesdev.com/w/index.php/Full_palette_demo">https://wiki.nesdev.com/w/index.php/Full_palette_demo</a><!-- m --><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">Normally, the PPU displays the palette byte from $3F00 as the background color. When rendering is disabled and the PPU address is in the $3F00-$3FFF range, the PPU displays the palette byte at that address.</div><br />But the only way I can see that happening in the code you posted is if the sound engine wasn't set up to use unique RAM.<br /><br />Another potential issue is a negative scroll value for Y, but similarly I can't see anything that would cause that except RAM collisions here.

There is actually not a lot of newbie-friendly documentation out there about how to &quot;disable&quot; sprites, even though it should be obvious once you think about it. The NES hardware always renders 64 sprites, wether you want it or not. You can use invisible tiles, etc. for sprites you don't want the player to see, but by far the best and easiest solution is to simply push every unused sprite out of the visible area by setting the Y coordinate to something higher than 240 pixels (where you don't have to worry about the 8 sprites on a scanline limit either).<br /><br />I'm assuming you're copying a full object table from a &quot;sprite buffer&quot; every NMI, so a good cause of this issue could be that you simply have a bunch of zeroes in your unused part of the RAM buffer, which places sprites in the top left corner like dougeff describes. A lazy way to initialize your sprite buffer if just to write $ff to every byte, but you also want to clear out unused sprites every single frame, so you don't leave old garbage ones hanging around.

(239 works because sprites are one pixel lower than the coordinate which is used in OAM).

Cheers! <img src="./images/smilies/Mfr_icon_homebrew.png" alt=":beer:" title="Beer" /> <br /><br />I had originally zero filled my sprite table thinking that was the way to go. I went back and replaced everything but the onscreen sprites with $EF and that fixed it. And now I realize why just turning off my sprite drawing routine was also causing the error since the PPU memory would still be zero when I turned sprites on.<br /><br />I've included the fixed rom file and source if anyone wants to check it out. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /> Deconstructing source and rom has really helped me fill in the gaps between the tutorials and actually making a game so I'm hoping someone finds it useful.<br /><br />You've also cleared up why setting my initial yscroll value to #$08 was the only way to get the screen to show properly.<br /><br />I've been using FCEUX as an emulator. Is there any way to see the PPU memory values?<br /><br />Next up is actually figuring out how to store, unpack, and display levels.  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_neutral.gif" alt=":|" title="Neutral" />

Yes, wrapping around, but in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two%27s_complement" class="postlink">two's complement</a> representation, a signed byte -8 is the same as an unsigned byte 256-8 (248).<br /><br />The NES picture also wraps to the next screen at Y=240, though, so it has two wrapping points, which is weird. (It's supposed to skip over 240-255, where the attribute data is stored, but if you start inside that range it will render a few lines of garbage data from it.)
