		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Parallax is a pretty good multiple-layer effect, but I think an even better effect is having it so that the background shows through transparent parts of the foreground, instead of having solid areas surrounding any foreground objects that don't quite fill up a whole block. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_lol.gif" alt=":lol:" title="Laughing" /><br /><br />That's one of the main reasons I decided not to have slopes outside of these minecart tracks, since I would need different slope tiles for every single thing I want to have the slopes overlaid on top of, and palette issues would complicate that a lot even if I did want to spend the tiles on it.

There's still some jitter, as you can tell by the vibrating player. They're rideable, and there's track pieces that cause minecarts to reverse direction, jump into the air, and speed up/slow down. I gave them only one pair of wheels instead of two because it looks less wrong going up and down slopes.<br /><br />Surprisingly they didn't take up nearly as much space as I thought they would to code the logic for, only about half a kilobyte so far.

Can I get some feedback on that?<br /><br />Ronald finally makes his appearance too in a level all about the burger ability. (2-3)<br /><br />Nova the Squirrel also now supports a SNES controller.

Running left at the last segment of 2-1 will do this. [acc: fast, speed: slow]<br /><br />Boulders instant kill? Well, that's one way to prevent skipping past them. It's not friendly, though.<br /><br />The push-one-space blocks' instant move doesn't look good. 2-2's three-tall stack-to-push can also be skipped by not pushing any and run-jumping from the top of its initial position.<br /><br />Ice block [or hamburger] may skip the final segment of 2-2; this seems intentional given the provided platform access.<br /><br />The cannons that just drip fry-bombs look odd, since they just drop straight down. (or was Ronald stuck in a cannon? not sure)<br /><br />2-4 the second switch (enables a floor to run over a gap) may be skipped with runspeed fast. Or burger.<br /><br />in fact, you can phase through the top brick on the screen in 2-4 by jumping and down-B burgering.<br /><br />You can get in the ceiling with burger down-B. if you have an upper corner you're facing away from. you gradually come out, though; I was unable to actually get stuck. (Burger also lets you bypass pushing that block all the way, but I expect that's intended.) In fact, burger lets you get through 100% of the item placement puzzles in this level, without placing any, if you're good. (Not something you should change, imo.)<br />…however, that you can just jump over the item-placement section with a jump, down-b, jump is maybe bad?<br /><br />Placed items vary in resulting palette.<br /><br />exiting the shop puts you on the latest world, rather than where you were.<br /><br />Dying after buying something means you don't have it? huh.[a: no, your inventory override for 2-5 is why I couldn't. The ice block I bought is back at 2-6]<br /><br />Being unable to see where Nova is when placing blocks is a handicap when you're trying to place from midair+inventory.<br /><br />Dropping onto screen 1 of 2-5 can have the sunmask get a cheap hit. In general such screen transitions that aren't ladder-based can yield a cheap hit.<br /><br />2-5 killed me a lot until I started using the items. Nice secret cache.<br /><br />2-6: Chips, and suction boots to defeat conveyors? (oh, and green-button alternator blocks?) Very obviously taking from Chip's Challenge. (except suction boots don't make much sense for defeating mid-air force-direction-thingies.)<br /><br />Did you forget to implement the actual counter for chips remaining? There's a chip by the HUD but no number. (or is that &quot;regular inventory is disallowed&quot;? guess it's the latter.)<br /><br />Tornadoes don't quite have a consistent carry spot for Nova; was bounced up and down while in one.<br /><br />Attack-while-climbing lacks animation. Or facing indication other than attack.<br /><br />2-7: placed items still don't affect the palette of a square. This means that the placed up-arrows (which aren't hinted to be forcibly-inventoried) don't look red as an arrow that WILL go off when headbonked(/touched) should.<br /><br />Standing up against the side of a boulder as it begins to fall = death<br /><br />Standing precisely between two pass-through platform squares still means you can't pass down through either.<br /><br />Ah, finally see the point of the dithered blocks: boulders can't pass through.<br /><br />2-7's second-to-last enemy placement, with two tracking monkeyfires and two remote bomb turrets, is a bit nasty…frankly, easiest to just tank a hit there.<br /><br />2-8:<s>uh, whatb oss?</s> known, I guess.<br /><br />Ice power doesn't have the burger 1/j limit. It's not really possible to abuse this, though. Also, it won't freeze all of a surface if you slide it off the edge normally, only 3 on, 1 off.<br /><br />I managed to defeat one of your &quot;don't go over the level&quot; bits in world 2, <s>can&#39;t remember which,</s> by …going over it. (2-1's first, using an iceblock or burger, and jumping)<br /><br />Running over the roof at start of 3-1 doesn't hit the money-and-checkpoint platform. Also, you can access this roofrun from that platform or the very beginning.<br /><br />I managed to beat 3-3 without riding on any minecarts (except to move them out of the way). I suspect I'm not on the usual difficulty curve. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" /> It was fun and challenging the first time.<br /><br />Occasionally checkpoints wouldn't count. I couldn't figure why.<br /><br />Pressing start in the options menu, even if you reach it by pausing, sends you out to level select. This is bad, if you were expecting to unpause and resume.<br /><br />edit to add: no guard against using a block on Nova's location, and it only takes one to trap yourself…but there is always that &quot;restart from checkpoint&quot; menu option.<br /><br />edit to add 2: winning 2-8 fight in mid-air put me in a place I instantly fell to my death, rather than the exit location.<br /><br />eta3: discovered a roundabout infinite jump. Down-B iceblock, jump, pause, select ice block (using one up), repeat.

Though the people on this forum are probably going to be awesome at platformers.<br /><br />&quot;Asume&quot; is a typo but &quot;das&quot; is intentional; the person that character is based off of actually does type like that.<br /><br />Looks like I need to finally get around to making the ChangeBlock routine update the palette of the changed block too. That shouldn't be too hard since I already have code for that from DABG. Money bags in world 3 also have the same problem where the money palette stays even though it changes to the background tiles.<br /><br />Boulders being deadly was because I thought the player would get stuck otherwise because of how I've implemented them (invisible solid blocks), but it looks like they just eject the player out of the way, so I've removed damage. If it somehow does cause a player to get stuck I suppose they can reset to the checkpoint.<br /><br />I noticed that a lot of stuff was skippable via ice or burgers or good jumps when I made the levels, and I decided that's usually fine. I could see someone having fun speedrunning the game and trying to get through the level with practiced jumping and ability use, and other players can take the safer and easier route of going through the level as intended. I'll stop them from bypassing huge chunks of the level though.<br /><br />The chip symbol was originally supposed to indicate &quot;this is a puzzle level, so the rules are different&quot; but I abandoned all the ideas for how they'd be different except for having a temporary fixed inventory set and ability. I should probably use a different symbol that's more related to what it actually does, and make sure the player knows to look in their inventory when they see it. I intend on marking them on the level select too. Chip collecting does need some sort of counter, I agree.<br /><br />World 2 is very, very blatant with being Chip's Challenge inspired. I mean, it even says &quot;bummer&quot; when you die. Yeah I guess it doesn't make sense for suction <em>boots</em> to apply to more than just floors, but it makes it more obvious what the function is. Chip's Challenge for Lynx uses a magnet to represent that item and that would probably be even worse.<br /><br />World 2's boss wasn't even coded yet so it's just World 1's boss again and an obviously unfinished level. Yeah I know you can die after the win text, I need to look into that.
