<br />
<br />SNES: all modes
<br />
<br />GameBoy: Mono and Color only, no support for advance.
<br />
<br />VGA and Mono PC Textmodes with 8x16 Font support
<br />
<br />Sega 1000 and compatible, MasterSystem, GameGear and MD/GEN mode
<br />
<br />Open Source as always
<br />
<br />EDIT - The reason I had PC Textmode in there is because most if not all editors require a package that I still cannot download with windows. (The QT Programming Package is too big)

<br />You can also write your own map editor. Or write a program that analyses a BMP, where the colour of a pixel corresponds to the appropriate tile. Then you can use a simple paint program as your map editor.
<br />
<br />...but if you're writing a port, why do you need a level editor at all? Why not just use the level data from the original ROM?

<br />What I am talking is the format of the 8x8 Tiles and Attributes for such formats, They do differ.
<br />
<br />This is not really a rushed thread, But one question remains, If there are no other formats besides NES supported, Why even bother?

<br />And yes, I can still disassemble 6502 quite well.

<br />
<br />Nametable is formatted in such a way to build screens, or in most cases Status bars, Cutscenes and Dialog/Text.
<br />
<br />Maps, on the other hand, Require Metatiles that are then put on top of the name table.
<br />
<br />Metatiles also handle Properties and Attributes for a Metatile as well as Collision for Sprites!

<br />
<br />So I suspect you could very easily use Open tUME or Tiled as a "name table" builder for those other consoles, the only
<br />
<br />But SMB is not exactly abundant, as far as I can see, in name table data that isn't either text, dynamically generated (numbers), or the result of drawing level data. The title screen, maybe?

<br />
<br />I guess it can be considered a TILEMAP, so you're right for the most part!
<br />
<br />Nametables (like Pattern tables) is actually a segment in VRAM that does screen works by rendering.
<br />
<br />I use Nametable Tools like Shiru's or YY's, But one is for Gameboy-like format and one for NES, I do not like making attributes with characters next to them like in SNES or Sega systems by hand in big amounts, Ick!
<br />
<br />Generators are only for images, even then, Duplicated 8x8 tiles do not really appeal to me!

<br />
<br />Honestly, I don't really understand your problem. Making a port of SMB1 is way more difficult than making a nametable editor, and basically you always need to make some custom tools for development for old platforms. So, if lack of ready made tool could stop you, I don't see how you going to accomplish your goal.

<br />Is that a threat? I don't think anyone really cares, we can all play SMB just fine now.
<br />
<br />EDIT: BTW, why is a name table editor so important? Most of the game's graphics are generated by the game engine dynamically, not prepared by the programmer. That code will have to be modified for every system you want the game to run on... I really don't see why the lack of a name table editor is a deal breaker for you.

<br />
<br />There exist plenty of generic map editors. They work for any game whose underlying world model is essentially a 2D array: the converter just has to understand the compression scheme that the game engine uses. They don't work for games that have an object-based world model like SMB series, where a converter would have a much harder time recognizing arbitrarily placed objects optimally.
