		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Interesting topic <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />
<br />
<br />Someone asked me recently (paraphrased): why, despite you hating trackers*, did you attempt to write one on the NES, of all platforms!?
<br />
<br />It's not an easy question to answer. I certainly don't stand to gain from it financially and it's been an utter drain on my spare time. I guess I fancied the challenge because it's something that hadn't been done before. Of course, once the giddiness died down and the rose-tinted glasses were off, the plethora of good-reasons-nobody-has-done-it-before was sobering <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />
<br />
<br />I guess I'm lucky that (despite a few naysayers) I've been overwhelmed by support, help and ideas for the tracker. I'm sure without that I'd have probably given up. There are pretty excruciating times where I'm at the point of breaking and ones where something works *just right* or better than you expect that make you smile again and renew enthusiasm.
<br />
<br />I'm certainly learning A LOT! I've never done anything like this before so I've had to learn quite a bit about areas of the NES that I've never touched.
<br />
<br />As for organising, I too have a huge text file (well, several) that I just fill with ideas/bugs as I'm working. Then when I've finished the current task I go back to the list and find something else to do. I never delete the notes though as sometimes it's important to review what you've done previously to stop you redoing something you'd earlier discounted or coding the opposite of something you've already done. I know this from mistakes <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />
<br />
<br />And I agree 100% about documenting stuff. And commenting your code. There was a period recently that I just had to stop coding and write the manual (despite it now needing a big revision) because I just couldn't remember how a lot of stuff worked in the editor, especially stuff like tokens for commands, which bits did what in parameters. I've also had to rewrite some big chunks of the editor recently and I had to go back over code that I wrote during the beginning. It was all mostly un-commented and I had a hard timing figuring out why I'd done stuff. There are still sections like that but mostly I have enough notes/comments to still understand the trickier bits.
<br />
<br />Actually, something I've started doing when embarking on a new bit of code is to write it out in english in comments first, breaking it in to logic flow. Then when it comes to coding, I put the code in between the comment lines. I find it helps visualise the code easier and also you have instantly commented sections.
<br />
<br />Finishing is something I have nightmares about. I keep getting really close to a releasable version and then something else crops up. I'd gotten my bug list down to one item the other day (plus I relegated a few features to "Medium Term Goals"). Then I decided to rewrite the player code. Then I decided the Song Arranger needed proper copy and paste features. So my to-do-list just exploded again.
<br />
<br />I know I have to finish this project and I'm utterly determined to get it released. I do worry that it's become somewhat of an obsession <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />
<br />
<br />
<br /><span style="font-size: 75%; line-height: normal">* I don't and have never *hated* them, I just didn't get them until I started to do some research. SDI on the C64 was probably the catalyst.</span>

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I would just like to apologize ahead of time if all this seems obvious, but it is important to any project to understand the software development life cycle. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_development_process" class="postlink">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_development_process</a> 
<br /> 
<br />while this sounds like a no brainer, i have tried to approach a number of ambitious projects with the code first, patch till working method, and it never net decent results.
<br />
<br />This sucks bad enough when working on a modern PC, but it gets even worse when working in a limited environment like the NES.
<br />
<br />I like to be REAL anal about keeping track of how i plan to use the available RAM.
<br />
<br />I also like to have a relationship between the locations of tiles. (EG, moving sprites have a set location for standing still, then have two animation frames for moving in each direction. for instance, '66' is standing, '76' and '86' is walking up, '46' and '56' is walking down, '67' and '68' is walking right, and '64' and '65' is walking left. ) You can make a define for the standing, then the rest are intuitive. if you map it out, you can arrange quite a few of these into a tileset if you stagger them, and you can use the tons of other tiles that have little relationship to one another in the gaps. this will save time wasted on looking at tile maps while programming, but requires preplanning.
<br />
<br />the trick when you want to do the work, if you wait until you are programming to start planning, you need to work within the scope of your existing code. if you plan ahead, you can make programming a lot easier, but you need to know what you are doing long before you start doing it.
<br />
<br />then again, the only project i ever actually completed was hangman, so take my advice with the weight of a grain of salt.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Hey guys,
<br />
<br />Long time lurker here.  I'm actually coming from the Atari 2600 dev community, but I can identify with a lot of what's been said.  Keeping motivation is the hardest part of any project I think.  Inevitably you'll have stretches where you do no work, and  I think this is where many projects die because it's just too easy to say "I don't want to bother with it right now" when you've been away from it for a while.
<br />
<br />What I do to overcome this is to tell myself "well just look at the code, you don't actually have to do any coding today.  Just look it over and try to refamiliarize yourself with things."  I think this is usually more effective in getting back in the game than telling myself "ok I have to sit down and start coding a solution for XY and Z".  Laziness almost always wins when you set your expectations too high. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />

<br />
<br />Do design work if you get burned out from code, so that at least you know what <a href="http://www.43folders.com/2005/09/12/building-a-smarter-to-do-list-part-i" class="postlink">to do</a>. In your design work, break things into individual steps that take no more than fifteen minutes, preferably five to ten.
<br />
<br />Times will come where you just can't think of anything. Have a B project for those times.
