I assume EST?  Also I would try to make it a little more explicit that the general guidelines don't apply to category 3.  I know you mentioned it, but perhaps move the guidelines above category 3 and name them &quot;Category 1&amp;2 General Guidelines&quot;?  Reading through it the way it's structured confused me for a min.<br /><br />Explaining the intent of category 3 might help people understand why it exists.  The main benefit of category 3 I see is that it's a means for people to include their work on the multicart which would otherwise be disqualified due to timing, prior compo entries that were submitted previously as WIP, etc.  Even if not able to be placed on the cart, it also allows people to get some publicity, aknowledgement, and praise for their work.

So should I try my hand at making an automated tool to mapper-hack individual NROM and CNROM images to mapper 28 so that entries won't exhibit failure modes like Concentration Room, LAN Master, Lawn Mower, Zooming Secretary, and MineShaft did when they mistakenly overwrote CHR ROM?

This can happen with overzealous VRAM clearing (as in games using older versions of Shiru's library) or with accidental +32-mode writes to the palette (as in Concentration Room). </li><li>In a mapper 28 entry using a fixed bank, write to register $81 only once, at the beginning of the program, so that the builder can NOP it out. </li><li>In a mapper 28 entry, make sure the value written to register $80 matches the size of the game. For example, always use $0x for a 32K entry or $1x for a 64K entry. </li><li>An 8K entry needs to leave a few bytes of RAM open for NMI redirection, and if it's included, we may ask you to relocate it to $C000 or $E000. </li><li>Leave $FFD0-$FFF9 unused for reset redirection. </li></ul>

IMO it would be much better to just have the entries be NROM/CNROM/BNROM/UNROM/AOROM images.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />My thought was the only REQUIREMENT be that the config/mapper be supported by mapper 28.  Not that submissions be mapper 28 roms necessarily.  We need to be able to get it on the multicart.  We should suggest different standard configs NROM/CNROM/BNROM/UNROM/AOROM etc and accept entries as those configs to help make things clear to people who don't care to have knowledge of mapper 28.  We will have to make sure they play freindly with the mapper 28 hardware in the end.  Specifically listing out Tepples' guidelines is a good idea, but I don't think we should go as far as disqualifing an entry for messing that up.<br /><br />I just don't want to limit people from being able to use the available hardware on the cart.  Not only is the selectable mirroring useful, but having bankswitchable CHR-RAM is a nice zero-cost feature.
