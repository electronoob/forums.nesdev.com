<br />When I connected this mouse to my Famicom through an adapter made to fit the 15pin exp connector on the front, I was able to controll the SMB1 mario with the mouse, even control the speed mario was running... But the controllers on the FC are always connected, so the behavior on real nes without plugged in controllers can be different.
<br />
<br />Is there anybody who's interrested in the NES/FC mouse anymore? Just asking...

The only thing I can confirm is that by connecting this mouse to original Famicom (minding the correct pinout) the result is different in comparison to this famiclone. It doesn't work with the original cartridge (pirate) software on normal Famicom. So there must be something in the famiclone itself.

<br />
<br />Were you thinking about just making your game run off a SNES mouse?  Then all you would need is a SNES to NES adapter that wouldn't require any electrical components.  All you'd have to do is solder two extension cords together.
<br />
<br />
<br />But if someone actually wanted to use it with original games you'd have to go this route:
<br /><div class="quotetitle">tepples wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"><br /><div class="quotetitle">Great Hierophant wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">Your idea involves rewritting input routines in these games and using something like a SNES-NES adapter on the 2nd controller.<br /><br />What about the other alternative, build an adapter that converts the mouse movement to control pad directions?</div><br /><br />That would limit movement to the speeds and directions available through the Control Pad, and the uC in the middle would have to model the game's own acceleration or autorepeat in order to translate distances accurately. </div>
<br />
<br />I'm kinda interested in this solution.  I realize the issue your bringing up though Tepples.  If there was a problem where you couldn't find one repeat periodicity that worked with most games, I wonder if you could implement a sensitivity adjust or something.

<br />That's what I was planning on doing. I'd make such an adapter, get a couple mouse-compatible homebrew games working, possibly make IPSes for a few popular commercial games, and try and talk emulator authors into supporting it.

<br />Thanks for the adapter. Here's one thing I learned while getting a simple mouse demo to work on an NTSC NES: If you support a mouse and a standard controller at the same time, your game MUST NOT use a DPCM-safe controller reading routine while the mouse is plugged in. Whenever you send a latch pulse (ldy #1 sty $4016 dey sty $4016), the mouse resets its tally of accumulated mickeys (movement quanta). The two reads in a typical DPCM-safe routine will discard all mickeys.
<br />
<br />This means that to patch, say, Duck Hunt, I'd have to rewrite the woof and quack sound effects.

<br />-- NovaYoshi after he played a special version of Thwaite with mouse support. But then he wants me to clone Videomation too; at that point, why not just replace his broken SNES and buy a copy of Mario Paint?
<br />
<br />Bug report: Mine appears to have a touchy solder joint. If the taped part isn't in just the right position, it'll stop returning mouse-like signals.

<br />Tepples:  Not sure what's up with that thing.  I actually had issues with it myself.  So I cracked it open and redid all the crappy solder joints that the chinese did so poorly.  It seemed like it did the trick when I retested it but I guess something else is going on or causing issues too...
<br />
<br />I'll whip you up another, I think I'll actually do it without the splice this time around.  I was thinking about it after I made it.  Those SNES connectors are pretty easy to crack open and I can just solder the NES cord to the SNES pins directly.  Should help prevent issues from arising again.
