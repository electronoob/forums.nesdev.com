		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I've recently done an overhaul on my sound engine by incorporating the DMC channel into it. The samples I currently have, a gunshot sound effect and an &quot;empty clip&quot; sound effect, sound okay on their own, at least as good as I feel they can sound for 1-bit DPCM (They use the highest sample rate), but when I put them in with the rest of the game, they always seem to be drowned out by the rest of the channels. When I compare it to other games' samples, especially those from sample-heavy games like Konami and Sunsoft games, theirs just seem a lot richer and louder overall. I guess I am currently just using the DMC channel as a glorified noise channel, so it kinda gets drowned out by the actual noise channel.<br /><br />Basically I'm just wondering if there's any auditory techniques or anything that can be done to make samples sound as good as they can; not fidelity-wise, but more volume-balance-wise. I know this is kind of a vague question, and I can elaborate better if need be.

For a long time I've had a &quot;convert FFT to best-fit NES APU registers at 60hz&quot; note on my to do list, so it's pretty cool to see someone actually has done it, at least for noise. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Three tips:<br />1) I don’t know about best, but you can get them smaller and reduce hi-frequency noise at the same time by speeding the clip up to a higher pitch, save, import, then play it back in your sound engine at a slower speed (ultimately this means fewer samples per second and as a result a treble roll-off). This might even suffice as a good enough lowpass filter instead of hardcoded filtering, if you’re lucky, but check case-for-case.<br /><br />Castlevania 3 does this. You’ll notice that the grunting noise, the tom, and the thunder is higher in pitch when played back neutrally.<br /><br />2) Low bitdepth is in an unhappy marriage with dynamic content. Abrupt volume changes result in noise. Try to keep the body of your samples flat, with the help of a limiter, compressor or compander plugin (compressor + expander).<br /><br />3) Really low frequencies take more energy to push than higher frequencies. If dynamic depth is limited (which it is), you may get better results by filtering out the lowest frequencies, so that they don’t suppress more important frequencies.

EQing a sound (esp. reducing bass) can go a <em>long</em> way to finding a balance that minimizes the distortion.

This shouldn't really produce a different result than just importing it at the final samplerate, so I was merely speculating that if it does happen to be effective this is maybe some quirk of your importer's resampler acting as a filter conveniently?<br /><br />...or ere you just saying to try a lower target samplerate to see if it sounds better? (It's that you specifically suggested to pitch it up before importing that throws me here... why not just import at the samplerate you want it to be played at?)

With a pitch shift up and a low output samplerate, you eventually start to push harmonic content outside the window if you go high enough = aliasing and low pass filtering. Of course, if you go low enough with the sample rate only, you get the same result. <br /><br />It is better (more controlled) to condition the sample with EQ:s / filters beforehand, at any rate.<br /><br />I agree setting just setting the sample rate is more straightforward. I just got used to a method where a sample in audacity is shifted by the count of semitones, and then account for that later.

If your sample isn't loud enough to reset the &quot;midpoint&quot; of the sample, this can be a thing (and even if it IS loud enough, you can tilt the data toward zero with RJDMC and FamiTracker).
