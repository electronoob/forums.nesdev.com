Wouldn't use candles be a little TOO much copied from the Castlevania series ? Anyway if you're making a castlevania parody anyway I guess it's allright, but even that NES parody Boko Dracula Kun (or somethingl like this) featuring Kid Alucard doesn't have candles if I remember right.<br /><br />I have never played Castlevania SOTN, but I have Castlevania Arria of Sorrow for the GBA, so I'll assume both are similar. By the way that game rocks.<br /><br />Display the health bar like in Castlevania 2 could do it ? It's a vertical bar too, and it only use 3 pattern tiles with a intelligent use of palette changing and flipping to display the whole bar (with 8x16 sprites). This has always impressed me a lot how they did it.<br /><br />Else you could go the Batman way : Display the status bar with sprites, and just after this bankswitch the CHRROM in order to get the actual player sprites swapped in, and make in sort that the player never reach the top of the screen.<br />Else just do a regular NES status bar using another nametable portion etc, etc... This will be a pain if you don't use 1-screen mirroring, as you'd have to relocate the status bar vertically (using horizontal mirroring), or even worse, change the screen position midframe so that it warps arround the status bar (using vertical mirroring).<br /><br />Something absoultely infamous would be to use sprites only in the middle of the "mini status bar", and always manage to have blank BG tiles below it or something like this. If you're scrolling only horizontally you could draw horizontal lines on the BG to look good. Do something like this if you want some challenge or something.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=38">Bregalad</a> — Sun Dec 16, 2007 4:05 am</p><hr />

I always expected to have many sprites on screen at once too, so using 8x16sprites was a certain thing.<br /><br />It's just a shame that the scanline counter of the MMC3 does not work well when you use 8x16 sprites from both pattern tables.<br /><br />But I believe you made a good choice, of using the MMC3 and 8x16 sprites I mean. Sprite 0 hits would be too difficult to manage inside the game, with scrolling and all the action going on.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=95">tokumaru</a> — Sat Dec 15, 2007 9:38 pm</p><hr />

Oh I see. So maybe I should use MMC3. I don't see how my old demo worked (and still works) on Nintendulator then, because I never put the init code in $E000-$FFFF, I had it in $8000-$9FFF.<br /><br />So yeah, I think I'll just use MMC3, and I think I may use 8x16 sprites to be able to have more going on.

9/10 sprites per enemy + character, 10 sprites for HUD, rest for candles?<br />Sounds like a lot to manage. Why sprite 0 anyhow instead of IRQ? With that many objects, I'd image bankswitching is a must for decent animation.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=20">kyuusaku</a> — Sat Dec 15, 2007 1:37 pm</p><hr />

I've said it many times before, but for anyone who doesn't know, I just have to say it again: The game I'm working on is almost exactly like Castlevania SOTN. If there was a hacking program, I'm pretty sure you could change everything to be exactly like SOTN. So you know, the player runs around doing all sorts of platforming, and his health is displayed in the top left corner like so:<br /><br /><img src="http://www.runjumpshoot.com/images/content/8/symphony-of-the-night-1.jpg" alt="Image" /><br /><br />There can be 4 enemies in my game on screen at once. All of them can attack at will. There's also candles and whatnot to take into account. This can easily take up all 64 sprites, and it may appear that there's not much going on. It will be even less action packed if I use sprites to display my character's Health, MP, and Hearts/Subweapon. I also want to do things with sprite 0 for background enemies. So all in all, my problems are:<br /><br />- I want to display my character's health with sprites to make it more appealing to the eye.<br /><br />- I would use a sprite #0 hit to just do a background display, but I need to use that for other things.<br /><br />Anyone have any suggestions?<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=138">Celius</a> — Sat Dec 15, 2007 12:32 pm</p><hr />
