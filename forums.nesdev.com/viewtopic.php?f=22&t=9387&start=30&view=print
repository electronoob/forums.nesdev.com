A cool one has to have a twist in the rules, good graphics, sound, music. An extremely large dictionary isn't actually needed to make a nice game of this kind.</div>My game does have sound effects and time limit though (but not much else, it is true). It is also public domain so if someone else want to make their own modification to this program and publish it that is OK with me.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">Sik wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">Actually, publishers want mostly complete games, but not finished. If it's too early then it's too risky to finance, if it's finished then they can't put any influence over it that can give them a legal advantage later.<br /><br />That's big publishers though, homebrew publishers are different... though they generally want exclusivity licenses or something like that =P</div>What if you want self publishing, is it better in some ways?<br /><br />Another possibility is even if no publishers will do it on NES/Famicom cartridge, it may be possible to publish it for use with emulators and include an emulator with it (for example, on Wii Virtual Console, on Windows PC, or whatever, with the proper emulator for each one; you can still sell cartridges too if you want to, I suppose).

The only requirement is that I make it explicitly clear that my CD is a video game.

I guess you ship off 5 copies of your master CD to them.  So, whatever your target platform can put up with.  I guess that'd be SegaCD if one can get Mairtrus's conversion code to work.  DreamCast could include an emulator for the game so much easier.  Whether you can order the tracks right for an average CD player.. Hmmmn..

They don't look anymore professional than any of the other hobbyists involved in this retro business. I know that many of these so called &quot;publishers&quot; don't even manufacture their own PCSs and cartridge cases, and still resort to recycling used carts... unlike Retrozone, who makes everything new.</div><br />Both of those publishers do manufacture everything new, and both take everything quite seriously.<br />I had a pretty good experience working with Super Fighter Team on Zaku.<br />I've only chatted with Fonzie at WaterMelon a few times, but they seem to be a nice group.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">rainwarrior wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">For these reasons I'm going to say just finish the game first. If you don't have experience and/or finished games to show off, no publisher is going to care about your game that is currently just ideas and sketches. Once it's done, or at least finished enough to be fun and playable, it should be fairly easy to sell to somebody who is in a proper position to publish that kind of game.<br /><br />When you do sell it, negotiate a proper contract. <span style="text-decoration: underline">Hire a lawyer</span> to look over your contract.<br /></div><br />This, this, a thousand times this. Especially the latter statement.<br /><br />If you don't want to manufacture the carts yourself, just email all of them and pick whichever gives you the best deal.<br />But I cannot emphasize enough, if you have a character-based game only sell the distribution / publishing rights and make sure you keep the character licenses under your control.<br /><br />With CD stuff, the Mysterious Song guys (on the PC Engine) got new CDs pressed. Maybe you could contact them and find out what manufacturer they used?
