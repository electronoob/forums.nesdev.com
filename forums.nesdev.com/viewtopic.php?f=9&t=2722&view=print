Are there any docs anywhere on how to do this? Im trying to make a Final Fantasy 3 but do not know how to battery save it =(  Thanks!

<br />Well, *do* a battery is a bit tricky. You need lithium and do some chimical thing on it. You cannot just add a battery to a board that haven't any slot for one. Well, you could, but that would be tricky to do. You'd want to had 2 diodes, 2 resistors, one capacity and one battery on a board that have no room for that. I don't think you'd learn much from it.

What does all the extra stuff do?  Does it just make sure the power is stable and clean?  Does it help prevent reset erase?

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Well, you cannot just connect the battery to the VCC/GND pins of the chip, else I'd be surprised if your battery don't leak when you turn on your NES.
<br />Why ? Because your NES uses a 5V power voltage, and lithium batteries are 3V (or 3.6 V). You need 2 diodes and 2 resistors between each power supply to avoid current drop from one power source to the others. A capacity is to be added to ensure proper transisions when the chip's powering source changes (so when you turn on and off your NES, the voltage on the SRAM chip will just slide smoothly instead of having bad pulses). Early SNROM boards doesn't have that capacity, but to personal experience saves are VERY OFTEN lost whathever on what you're doing on such boards, so be aware.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />So the diodes keep the power from kinda mixing and leaking back.  The capacator keeps the power stable as it switches between the two voltages.  what do the resistors do?
<br />
<br />If there were a 5 volt coin battery, would it only need the capacitor?
<br />
<br />So, why can't I cut the VCC and the Ground and then just attach the battery?
<br />
<br />
<br />Tormenter:  I have been looking for a battery holder that will fit myself, so if I find one, I'll let you know.  
<br />
<br />Personally, I've been using the Famicom Final Fantasy III cart for a donor and then using a famicom to nes adaptor from a Stack-up to make it a nes cart.  It really costs about the same and then you only have to replace the prg rom with an eprom.

<br />I'm myself not too sure about that, but a diode in fowrard polarity drops a 0.7V voltage. So you cannot connect just both diodes together, you'll need at least one resistor to drawn the voltage between both source, I think NES carts uses two resistors, but I cannot give the exact shematics, I've just noted that on carts I have. This isn't the ultimate shematic. It's also possible to use circuits with transistors to do battery backup, and there is even integred circuits that does the work. I'm not an expert, it's just the NES games uses two diodes and two resistors. You can go with the shematic you want, actually.
