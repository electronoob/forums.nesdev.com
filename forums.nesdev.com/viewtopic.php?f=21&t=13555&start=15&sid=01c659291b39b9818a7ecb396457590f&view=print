The NES does colour emphasis uniformly in the YUV colour space.<br /><br />What's not uniform is how people convert YUV to RGB. Every way of doing it is compromised in some way.

There's maybe good methodologies and bad ones, but even with good practices it's ultimately a matter of choice about what compromises you want to make to fit a square peg into a round hole.

	</div>As you can see, in the top screenshot (with the UnTweaked palette), $24 appears to be too close to the 'warm' side of the spectrum, and thus looks out-of-place compared to $14 and $34.<br /><br />The hue I tweaked $24 to (bottom screenshot) looks more like an intermediate shade between the 'light' and 'dark' purples used in that room.<br /><br />As far as $xC goes: I liked when it was slightly bluer like in the other palette that I posted much earlier in this thread. In the case of $24 and the $xC colors, I copied the un-tweaked color, changed its Hue to match the one I wanted, then tweaked its Value until it looked about the same (luminosity-wise) as the original, un-tweaked color.<br /><br />Aside from the hue-replacement I did on the four colors mentioned above, I also did some minor tweaks to the tint on ten other colors: using NEStopia's Hue control, I tinted the palette to -0.6º to make it a little warmer; from that, I copied $06 and $16, $07 and $17, $08 and $18, and $x9 over the un-tweaked colors.<br /><br />It made the reds and browns look more like what I see on my actual TV, made the dark yellows look ever-so-slightly less green (helping to separate them from the <em>actual</em> greens), and… I just like the slightly-yellower/warmer $x9. Green's my favorite color — and I have a soft spot for that particular set of greens in particular. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt=":mrgreen:" title="Mr. Green" /><br /><br />Those are the only tweaks I did to make my 'Definitive' palette from this base, however. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><div class="quotetitle">M_Tee wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">I never thought someone would post a palette that I prefer to NEStopia's, but I really dig what you've done there, Kizul.<br /><br />The main fault with NEStopia's palette, as far as I can tell, is the strong value jump between $x0 entries and $x1. The darks are just too dark. The other fault that nearly all NES palettes have is that they're just too saturated. If I were to adjust the settings on my TV to produce colors that saturated, then actual live-action television would be unwatchable.</div>Hurray! <img src="./images/smilies/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt=":mrgreen:" title="Mr. Green" /> I'm happy you like it.<br /><br />In regard to the saturation levels: my tuner card uses a Bt8x8 tuner (I don't remember the exact one), and aside from using DScaler's Gamma Boost filter (and a few noise-reduction filters — also in DScaler — whose settings I cranked to maximum), I used as close to the default picture settings as possible.<br /><br />If I recall correctly: in the Bt8x8 advanced settings, I turned on the 'Full Luma Range' setting, and also the Automatic Gain Crush (AGC) for both Odd and Even scanlines; if not for those being on… yeah, the colors would've looked hideously garrish and over-saturated. (And I also turned <em>off</em> Odd/Even Luma Peak, to help reduce noise.)<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">M_Tee wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">As for the blue at 23, that was <a href="http://www.fceux.com/web/pressrelease-2.2.0.html" class="postlink">an admitted mistake by FCEUX's developer</a> and corrected with version 2.2.0.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">FCEUX 2.2.0 Release wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">Fixed wrong default palette entry</div><br /><br />FCEUX is up to <a href="http://www.fceux.com/web/download.html" class="postlink">version 2.2.2</a> now, so it may be time to update your copy.</div>Ahhhh, I see.

XD)<br /><br /><span style="font-size: 150%; line-height: normal">*<strong>EDIT:</strong></span> What dougeff said here kept nagging at me:<br /><div class="quotetitle">dougeff wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"> I much prefer 0,0,0 for all blacks. I think is gives better contrast.</div></div>He's technically correct. (The best kind of correct.)<br /><br />I was showing off my palette to my sister just a little while ago tonight, comparing it with a game that she was familiar with (Bucky O'Hare) in both an emulator and in the actual NES on our TV.<br /><br />And I noticed something: the blacks on the TV were a lot darker than the blacks in the emulator. <em>So:</em> I have retroactively revised the palette files in this and my previous post, and also the palette image in this and my previous post to reflect the <em>improved</em> black levels. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_neutral.gif" alt=":|" title="Neutral" /><br /><br />Also, I'm curious, dougeff: is my palette with newly-revamped black levels better/more acceptable? <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />$0D is now pure black (0,0,0), and $xE/$xF are now 20,20,20 instead of 35,35,35 — which really <em>was</em> much too bright — so as to keep 'compatability' with The Immortal. $1D, however, still <em>is</em> 35,35,35, because any darker and it doesn't show up correctly in Bee 52. I checked the brightness level for $1D in Bee 52 against my TV, too, in the first dark level that uses a mostly-black screen. (You can easily warp to the level I used via going through either door and entering the farthest flower from the hive in Level 1.)

There's no such thing as a <em>perfect</em> RGB-format NES palette, alas. But at least all of the colors look like maybe they go together pretty well and contrast well against each other. (A bit better than many other NES emulator palettes out there do, at least.) And the brightness levels along each successive row is fairly consistent, and the hues in each column are cleanly separated. There are some palettes out there where the $0x colors are nearly black, the $3x colors are nearly white, and vibrance of the $1x and $2x fluctuates <em>wildly</em> (with some colors being either far too saturated, the wrong hue, or both).<span style="font-size: 85%; line-height: normal"><br /><br />I still need to see how my palettes would look on my actual TV — just to see how close they really are to the actual hardware from which they were 'ripped'. :p But I digress.</span>
