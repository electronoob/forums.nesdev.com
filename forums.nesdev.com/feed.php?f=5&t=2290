Nothing prevent you to planify your work if you have a lot of free time. But effectivly, having free time isn't all you should use it the best you can, wich is the real problem. Too often I'd just rather relax doing nothing, surf the web without any goal or playing games instead of working on my project.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=38">Bregalad</a> — Fri Oct 20, 2006 9:02 am</p><hr />

Take it from me, even with 100% free time, there's still not enough to finish everything desired. I'd say that one always strives for more than is possible (and that this is a good thing). I think that with less free time I'd get more done because I'd value it more and prioritize and plan project work better.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=17">blargg</a> — Thu Oct 19, 2006 6:06 pm</p><hr />

I think we all probably suffer from not having enough time in the day to do all the things we want to do.  I'd like to spend more time on NES stuff as well as learn to code for other systems.  Here lately I've only had just enough time to write little tech demos to make sure I understand key concepts of NES programming.  All these pieces will eventually be used in my game ..... just don't know when.  I stopped taking "side jobs" a while ago ... just because I found my free time (to do what I want) is more important.  However, even lately my free time isn't very much ... maybe an hour or so a night.... so if you figure out how to get more "free time" .. by all means ...share!<br /><br />PS Tokumaru ... I'd like to see some of the games you were telling me about.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=284">lynxsolaris</a> — Thu Oct 19, 2006 6:00 pm</p><hr />

Well, unless you're in serious lack of money, there is no way you could waste your time to get any.<br />I REALLY wish I could exchange money for free time myself. Nothing's like free time. And as long as you have enough money to buy food, all the electrical devices and games you want and some extra for whathver, you don't need to get any more.<br /><br />Working can be good if you're doing something that mostly interest yourself, but else you're just wasting your time. And anyway, work for yourself is always better than work for someone else, regardless how selfinsh it sounds.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=38">Bregalad</a> — Thu Oct 19, 2006 1:40 pm</p><hr />

You know, today I was offered a few bucks to code someone else's final project for college. It's not something very big, and I could probably do it (it's just regular, boring database/form coding, in Delphi). But I'm still thinking if this is worth my free time. I work all day, and I have school at night. So no free time for me during the week, except for one or other morning or evening (when I don't have classes).<br /><br />Now, I'm already terrible at focusing on my own projects, but accepting this offer means leaving them completely aside for quite a while. Then I started to think about this the other way around: If I dedicated myself to one of my (8-bit) projects as much as I'll have to for this job, I could probably finish a game.<br /><br />Then I though: "What is more important for me? A few extra bucks (after hours of boring coding), or a finished game (after hours of fun coding)?". The answer is quite clear my friends, of course I'd rather have my own project finished.<br /><br />There was a time where I would accept any job, so that I'd have money to buy stuff. The problem is, I end up buying a lot of stuff but don't have any time to use them, 'cause I'm working. But then, if I don't work, I can't buy anything to use. So it's a vicious circle, really.<br /><br />Anyway, I have decided now to not get any extra work, besides my regular job. I already have very little time as it is, and I won't sell that time that easy (and I doubt anyone is willing to pay what I think it's worth for me). So now I'm thinking of a way to refuse that offer gently.<br /><br />It's jut that I just can't spend all my time working. I can't live like a robot. I see people living like that and it scares me. I don't wanna end up like that. If I don't get any fun on a regular basis, I'll go crazy. Seriously.<br /><br />How do you guys handle these situations?<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=95">tokumaru</a> — Thu Oct 19, 2006 11:58 am</p><hr />
