Anyway, the pin pitch, size and position are the same in all three packages.<br /><br />GSU-2 and GSU-2-SP1 share the same pinout altough pin layout is not the same as you said.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Well, I just finished measure the GSU-1A and MARIO Chip and added it to qwertymodo's EAGLE library. The pin pitch is 0.65mm and pin width 0.35mm. The dimensions are:<br /><br /><a href="http://imageshack.us/photo/my-images/641/mariogsu1.png/" class="postlink"><img src="http://imageshack.us/a/img641/4101/mariogsu1.th.png" alt="Image" /></a><br /><br />I will compare this size with GSU-1 but my feeling is that all three chips have the same package, pin pitch, pin width and even height (0.3mm, so is not a Thin-QFP, but an standard rectangular QFP100). BTW, if somebody is planning to make its own developing board, this adapter could be the most suitable for soldering the SuperFX and placing it in a standard through-hole board:<br /><br /><a href="http://www.ace4parts.com/Products/QFP--100-Pins-065mm-Pitch----2-X-2-Grid__201-0010-01.aspx" class="postlink">http://www.ace4parts.com/Products/QFP--100-Pins-065mm-Pitch----2-X-2-Grid__201-0010-01.aspx</a><br /><br />This could be useful to for testing the SuperFX without having it soldered to a board.

	</div><br />The thing has three test screens:<br />1) showing all GSU I/O ports, including the GSU version register, and unused/writeonly/undocumented ports.<br />2) showing results of a simple RUN-STOP test (with things like the program counter after stop)<br />3) showing timings for different CPU and Multiply speeds with &amp; without code cache enabled.<br /><br />Easiest way to run the test program would be to boot the test program from cartridge, and then replace the test cartridge by a gsu cartridge (you'd only need to bypass the anti-eject mechanics).<br />Booting via my &quot;xboo cable&quot; should be also working, at least with some small modifications (namely deactivating /RD in similar fashion as /ROMSEL).<br />And finally replacing the GSU ROM by Test EPROM should also work, but that'd be a LOT of work, especially when doing it for all MC1/GSU1/GSU1A/GSU2/GSU2-SP1 variants.<br /><br />The included source code contains some Argonaut RISC code, which can be assembled with current (still unreleased) no$sns version. Don't know when I'll get around to release it, but I can upload a beta version of the assembler in case somebody wants to modify the source code.<br /><br />Currently I've tested the test program only in my emulator - test results on real GSUs would be interesting! Both to see how the GSUs work in general, and to see differences between the 5 chip versions.<br /><br />If somebody would <strong>donate a GSU cartridge</strong> for research purposes - that would be pretty motivating to add more tests the test program (like testing memory mirrors, open bus things, timings, unused opcodes, unused pins, etc.) doing that tests would be nice, but isn't too much fun without having real hardware :-/

If I get one, I'll probably cut it apart, wire stuff to it, and prefer to keep it (for cases when I should happen to do more tests).

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I can help you with that part.<br /><br />Ground pin 4 of the SNES CIC (the one inside the console itself.) I have had success on three consoles by just lifting the pin (leaving it in an open state), but obviously the proper way is to ground it.<br /><br />By doing this, you will no longer be able to play SA-1 or S-DD1 games on that console. So if possible, see if you can make it a switch. The pins are insanely tiny, the onboard CIC is surface mount, and about the tiniest of any pins I've ever encountered.<br /><br />The way it works is +5V on this pin means it acts like a lock, and GND acts like a key. When two keys see each other, both chips give up and disable. But this doesn't engage /RESET, so you are then free to swap carts, which you obviously need to do with the lid off so the eject lock doesn't get in your way. Obviously, the SA-1 and S-DD1 will not unlock their ROMs until they are speaking to a master, and you still need a valid CIC on the cart to make the SNES CIC disable itself.<br /><br />The much nicer way would be to install the SuperCIC with ikari's modifications to allow hot-swapping, then you can even do it with SA-1 cartridges. He has custom code to put onto a PIC (or PIF maybe? Not sure ...) that emulates the CIC. I think the PIC he was using has been discontinued, but someone here has ported it to a different chip.<br /><br />As for running custom code on the SuperFX, you can execute it out of RAM, but getting ROM-based timings won't be possible. Doesn't matter for a whole lot, just means you can't test things like the ROM buffer cache (which is probably similar to the RAM buffer cache) and such.<br /><br />Not sure what all there is to glean. I've pretty much gotten all the timings down for that chip, even down to the 16-byte stripe filling of the 256-byte instruction cache. The differences between multiplication speeds and such between GSU-1 and GSU-2 are well documented.<br /><br />The only mystery to me at this point is what happens when the secondary pixel cache is filled, the primary pixel cache needs to dump its data, and code is executing out of RAM ... does it stall the code execution to the program (most likely), or does it interleave program code and secondary pixel cache dumping (crazy), or does it glitch out and lose the contents of the secondary pixel cache (horrifying)?

For GSU1/GSU2 differences I am only aware of the different pinouts. Though maybe that's actually all about it and there aren't any further differences, and even the VCR register returns the same version number for either chip?<br />In bsnes_v091-source code, I've found this folder &quot;bsnes\processor\gsu&quot; containing some GSU info, though I haven't spotted any timing or version related things there. The risc opcode emulation looks similar as in no$sns. The problem (in my emulation) is that I've just guessed the mirroring for undefined opcodes; don't know if you've guessed that stuff too, or if it was tested on real hardware.<br />Multiply speed is more or less documented, I don't know if fast multiply works on all chip versions, and don't know what happens in the &quot;invalid&quot; combination (fast cpu speed plus fast multiply speed enabled together).

Sadly, I can believe people were stupid enough to try that. But it would take a monstrous amount of force to damage the deck that way, and it wouldn't stop the problem with the 30% of games still using the old style.
