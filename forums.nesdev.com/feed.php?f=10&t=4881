For volume envelopes and arpeggio envelopes (basically like pitch envelopes), I actually keep my "ticks" system. Seriously, 1 tick is usually super fast (many times 1/40 of a second). I use software envelopes ONLY. If you plan on adjusting the speed of a song and its volume envelope speed, do not use hardware decay. Anyways, an "instrument" that will play a pitch fading out would use a volume envelope that looks like:<br /><br />VolumeEnvelope:<br /> .db $08,$08,$08,$08,$07,$07,$06,$06,$05,$05,$04,$04,$03,$03,$02,$02,$01,$01,$01,$00<br /><br />Where each entry is a volume for the square wave. Each "tick" it moves onto the next entry.<br /><br />Seriously though, like I was saying before, I would stay away from hardware volume decay. Manually update the volume. It may seem like it'd be "blocky", but it's not at all. It goes too fast for you to notice.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=138">Celius</a> — Sun Feb 22, 2009 10:29 pm</p><hr />

If you need really accurate precision for whatever reason (like that one guy who made that metronome program), then you definately would not want this approach.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"><br />OK, if the shortest note I'll be playing is a 16th note, somehow I have to make it last 7.5 frames (if the tempo is 120 bpm).

So 60Hz (or even 50Hz) is plenty fast enough.<br /><br />I had a semi-solution to this that I never actually tried.  The idea was similar to Celius' idea, but compounded.  Basically every frame you add N to a counter, and when it wraps, you have volume and everything take 1 step, and you also add M to the tempo, and when that wraps, you decrement note lengths and whatnot.<br /><br />So it's basically exactly the same as Celius' idea, only its two stages.  The tempo (M) wouldn't need to be changed for NTSC/PAL, but instead the rate (N) would change.<br /><br />Of course this is a little extreme, and is probably pretty computation heavy.<br /><br />Another, possibly more reasonable approach would be to do a variation of my tempo idea and use different LUTs for NTSC/PAL, rather than trying to do the computations at runtime.  Rather than saying "wait 5 frames between volume changes", you can say "wait 5 units between volume changes", and look up 5 units in a LUT (which could be 5 frames on PAL, but 6 frames on NTSC).<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=33">Disch</a> — Sun Feb 22, 2009 8:06 pm</p><hr />

<div class="quotetitle">tokumaru wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"><br />Disch, can you explain this part a little better? I'm not getting it.<br /></div><br /><br />One "beat" is typically one quarter note.  If you want a resolution higher than a quarter note (in my example I used a 16th note as the highest resolution note length) you need to scale the frames-per-note appropriately.<br /><br />Here's a working example:<br /><br />If you have 90 bpm, that's 40 frames per beat (NTSC).  This would mean that a quarter note would last 40 frames, an 8th note would last 20 frames, a 16th note would last 20 frames, a 32nd note would last 10 frames, etc, etc.<br /><br />Another way put my previous example would have been:<br /><br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">.macro make_tempo_table   fpb<br /><br />.byte &#40;fpb&#41;*1/4  ; 16th note<br />.byte &#40;fpb&#41;*2/4  ; 8th note<br />.byte &#40;fpb&#41;*3/4  ; dotted 8th<br />.byte &#40;fpb&#41;      ; quarter<br />.byte &#40;fpb&#41;*3/2  ; dotted quarter<br />.byte &#40;fpb&#41;*2    ; half<br />.byte &#40;fpb&#41;*3    ; dotted half<br />.byte &#40;fpb&#41;*4    ; whole note<br /><br />.endmacro <br /></div><br /><br />Where 'fpb' would be the frames per beat.  This would be without the /4 -- so 120 bpm would be (60*60)/120 fpb.<br /><br />However you subject yourself to truncation errors when you divide like this, which would result in music desyncing.  If you were to make a 120 bpm table with this macro.. you'd get the following:<br /><br />quarter note = 30 frames<br />8th note = 15<br />16th note = 7 (truncated)<br /><br />Due to the truncation, two consecutive 16th notes would only last 14 frames instead of the desired 15.<br /><br />So rather than divide in the table, my original example scaled the whole table up so that division wasn't necessary.  Rather than passing the "frames per beat" to the macro, I pass "frames per shortest note".  Since the shortest note in the table is a 16th note, I'm effectively passing "frames per 16th note" -- and since a 16th note is 1/4th the length of a quarter note, I divide the fpb by 4 to get that.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=33">Disch</a> — Sun Feb 22, 2009 6:58 pm</p><hr />

<div class="quotetitle">Celius wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"><br />For this reason it's good to have a tempo that's easily adjustable. And in NTSC songs you'll want to make it so the tempo is not at max speed (at max 5/6 of max speed so you can convert it to PAL). I'm not quite sure what you're doing for tempo, but I have a system where I specify one byte as the tempo. Each frame, it is added to itself, and if there's a wrap around, there's a tick. All note lengths are measured in these "ticks". So if you have the tempo set at $A0, it would look like this:<br /><br />Frame 0: $A0 + $A0 = $40 (tick)<br />Frame 1: $40 + $A0 = $E0 (no tick)<br />Frame 2: $E0 + $A0 = $80 (tick)<br />Frame 3: $80 + $A0 = $20 (tick)<br />Frame 4: $20 + $A0 = $C0 (no tick)<br /><br /><br />See in some frames, there isn't a tick, so there aren't 60 ticks a second. (There are actually 37.5). So you can raise this value to be higher so that it ticks more often:<br /><br />Tempo = $FF<br /><br />Frame 0: $FF + $FF = $FE (tick)<br />Frame 1: $FE + $FF = $FD (tick)<br />Frame 2: $FD + $FF = $FC (tick)<br /><br />Though you'd only want to use tempo $FF in PAL mode, because otherwise you couldn't adjust it from NTSC to PAL to be faster.<br /><br />Which brings me to my point. What you'd want to do is for NTSC have a max tempo of $D5 (5/6 of 256). This tempo will give you 50 ticks a second on NTSC, which is what $FF will give you on PAL mode. If you follow those guidelines, once you want to convert it to PAL, you can just multiply the tempo by 6/5.<br /><br />I think Bregalad is the one who suggested this method of timing to me. It's actually quite clever, I think.<br /></div><br /><br />Dude, you've accidentally helped me out a lot again!  I had some question marks in my sound notes - had very little idea what was going on with certain values - and now I know what they are!  It now appears to me that The Guardian Legend uses this same method to keep tempo for its music.  Only they don't seem to keep PAL much in mind because the intro song (the one I've been tracing) adds #$DE every frame <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />.  I'd like to check the PAL version of the game to see if there is a little bit of slowdown in the song (I think there must be).<br /><br />Anyway, this was the missing piece of the puzzle for me and now I think I've finally cracked TGL's music format (minus a few effect-related details).

Yeah, even if you don't use the method I suggested, I'd still highly recommend basing all music around an easily changeable tempo. As long as you can do that, you can pretty much do whatever you want otherwise, just multiply the NTSC tempo by 6/5 for PAL. If you can do that, you're completely set.<br /><br />I'm actually rewriting my music engine. I'm still in the planning phase, because I really don't want to do another rewrite again, so I know how it is.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=138">Celius</a> — Sun Feb 22, 2009 4:10 pm</p><hr />

Thanks guys. This is still hypothetical for now, I don't have a working engine yet, NTSC or otherwise. I figured I'd ask first so that I could make it as versatile as possible, before it's too hard to modify.<br /><br />I appreciate the suggestions, and you can really suggest whatever you think works best, as I don't have anything coded yet on the sound department.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=95">tokumaru</a> — Sun Feb 22, 2009 3:55 pm</p><hr />

Alternatively, assuming you don't need a super flexible tempo, you can use one or more fixed LUTs which have tempos for note lengths pre-calculated into number of passing frames.  I saw this technique used in FF1 and it actually seems extremely practical and efficient, and makes for very simple PAL tempo adjustment.<br /><br />Here's pseudocode to illustrate the idea:<br /><br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">.macro make_tempo_table   n<br /><br />.byte &#40;n&#41;      ; 16th note<br />.byte &#40;n&#41;*2    ; 8th note<br />.byte &#40;n&#41;*3    ; dotted 8th<br />.byte &#40;n&#41;*4    ; quarter<br />.byte &#40;n&#41;*6    ; dotted quarter<br />.byte &#40;n&#41;*8    ; half<br />.byte &#40;n&#41;*12   ; dotted half<br />.byte &#40;n&#41;*16   ; whole note<br /><br />.endmacro<br /><br /><br />tempo_ntsc_120bpm:<br />  make_tempo_table &#40;60*60&#41; / &#40;120*4&#41;<br /><br />tempo_pal_120bpm:<br />  make_tempo_table &#40;50*60&#41; / &#40;120*4&#41;<br /></div><br /><br />Hopefully my math is right:<br /><br />60*60 = frames per minute (NTSC)  [f/m]<br />50*60 = frames per minute (PAL)<br /><br />120 = beats per minute  [b/m]<br /><br />4 = quarter note is *4 in the table, therefore you must divide by 4 to cancel that out.  Don't want to divide in the table because that will result in data loss that will make music desync if you use notes faster than a quarter note.<br /><br /><br />(f/m) / (b/m) = f/b   --  frames per beat.  That divided by 4 = frames per 16th note.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=33">Disch</a> — Sun Feb 22, 2009 3:11 pm</p><hr />

For this reason it's good to have a tempo that's easily adjustable. And in NTSC songs you'll want to make it so the tempo is not at max speed (at max 5/6 of max speed so you can convert it to PAL). I'm not quite sure what you're doing for tempo, but I have a system where I specify one byte as the tempo. Each frame, it is added to itself, and if there's a wrap around, there's a tick. All note lengths are measured in these "ticks". So if you have the tempo set at $A0, it would look like this:<br /><br />Frame 0: $A0 + $A0 = $40 (tick)<br />Frame 1: $40 + $A0 = $E0 (no tick)<br />Frame 2: $E0 + $A0 = $80 (tick)<br />Frame 3: $80 + $A0 = $20 (tick)<br />Frame 4: $20 + $A0 = $C0 (no tick)<br /><br /><br />See in some frames, there isn't a tick, so there aren't 60 ticks a second. (There are actually 37.5). So you can raise this value to be higher so that it ticks more often:<br /><br />Tempo = $FF<br /><br />Frame 0: $FF + $FF = $FE (tick)<br />Frame 1: $FE + $FF = $FD (tick)<br />Frame 2: $FD + $FF = $FC (tick)<br /><br />Though you'd only want to use tempo $FF in PAL mode, because otherwise you couldn't adjust it from NTSC to PAL to be faster.<br /><br />Which brings me to my point. What you'd want to do is for NTSC have a max tempo of $D5 (5/6 of 256). This tempo will give you 50 ticks a second on NTSC, which is what $FF will give you on PAL mode. If you follow those guidelines, once you want to convert it to PAL, you can just multiply the tempo by 6/5.<br /><br />I think Bregalad is the one who suggested this method of timing to me. It's actually quite clever, I think.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=138">Celius</a> — Sun Feb 22, 2009 12:51 pm</p><hr />
