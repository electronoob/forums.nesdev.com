I have found the reason why Cuba Solider and Pac Land died. they both wait 2002.7 to be set with NMI enabled... I have read this in some material before. But treated it as a very special case and thought that little game would do this...<br /><br />  But Dragon Quest 1 and Adventure Island still not work.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=528">darklink</a> — Sun May 21, 2006 7:31 pm</p><hr />

First of all, i repeat my signature. my English is poor, so don't be crazy on me if you have a hard reading. And I'll be very happy if you understand what I want to say.<br /><br />  my nes emulator was finished several days ago.  it is scanline base now for simpleness.<br />  seems some game works well on it, such as <br />NROM: Balloon, Mario1...<br />MMC1: Dragon quest 4(japanese and english version), Zelda1,2...<br />UNROM: Castlevania1,Rygar, Dragon quest 2(japanese)<br />MMC3: Metal max(by data east), Shadow of ninja, Mario2<br /><br />  I test it with NESTRESS.NES downloaded from the main page. it is ok for all cpu and addressing mode test, as well as all ppu test except the SPRITE#0 hit. I think it is impossible for scanline base emulator to pass that test because VIRTUAL NES which is scanline base is fail, too. <br />  I aslo test it with S0.NES, and seems it is ok because the result is same as what VNES and FCULTRA except for the mid-scanline effect. Aslo by considering this that I believe my ppu implement is correct as a scanline base emulator and the cause of the failure above is no mid-scanline-hit detect.<br /><br /><br />  following is the problem on some games:<br /><br />  PAC LAND by NAMCOT in 1984-1985, title screen is normal, but after pressing START to start the game, it halt with a black screen.<br />  CUBA SOLIDER by SNK in 1987, when power on or reset, the BG turn  white and hold it there. It should display the blue 'SNK' sign then.<br /><br />  when implement CNRON(mapper 3). I test it with DRAGON QUEST 1(japanese) and Adventrue Island 1. both failed. <br />  For dq1, the background trun black(not gray set in reset) but hold it there(should display the title).<br />  For adventure island, the screen keep gray all the time.<br />  UNROM is one of the simplest mapper, and I have check the code(less than 20 lines) again and again but found nothing(aslo read this part of VNES and NESTER source). So I believe that the bug in not in mapper implement, perhaps it is the same one as that holds Cuba Solider.<br /><br />  these are all early games(before 90), so I think that they doesn't use the quirks that not scanline base emulator could handle(and VNES could emulator them all). But with all the games and test result above, I can't figure out which part is the cause of this problem. (Adventure Island must be not relate to APU because even a semi-emulator without sound implement could display the title and start the game).<br /><br />  Please give me some advice for all about this. Thanks !<br />  And  Aslo Thank you for read all my broken words patiently.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=528">darklink</a> — Sat May 20, 2006 1:11 pm</p><hr />
