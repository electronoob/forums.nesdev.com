<div class="quotetitle">MetalSlime wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"><br />I plan on writing a bunch of articles with example code to tackle specific topics, so that influx might be coming <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /></div><br /><br />Great to hear!  I already read your article and this is simple and useful. There is only one issue but not specific to your article.  Right now the article was made with some code sample in ca65. Everyone as it's own taste of assembler they like. How to make everyone happy in that situation... I would like to find a way to be able to show the article with different syntax but how. hmm... For example, when you use MSDN, you can select for which language to see the sample by checking some checkbox at the top.  I don't know if we can find a way to make something similar or if there is a plug-in for the wiki for this.  Another possibility is that we do all the sample for 1 assembler only for uniformity but hmm..<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">MetalSlime wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"><br />I think programming articles should be separated from hardware/reference articles.<br /></div><br /><br />Yes, this is correct. It should explain the hardware only and not show example. Right now the reference section is a little bit messy about that. The programming section can go in more detail for a specific option.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">MetalSlime wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"><br />I envision a main "Programming" section, and then under it have different sections like "Compression", "Mappers", "Sound", "Graphics", "AI", etc.  Then those sections would have individual articles under them.<br /></div><br /><br />I have the same idea too.  And some section that explain which assembler exist, tool for map etc. There is not enough information about that. I was searching recently for a tool that can import some bmp but there was no information about that in one place, which one is better for what reason etc. You often end up making your own tool when there could be already one available!<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">MetalSlime wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"><br />For example under "compression" you'd have a bunch of articles: "programming RLE", "programming Fixed Bit Length Encoding", "programming Huffman", etc.  Then, if someone is writing their game and they think "hmm.. I wonder how I should go about compressing the text in my game", they can head to the programming-&gt;compression section and read through the articles there.  They will get a good idea of how many compression algorithms work, and they will get to see some example code so they have an idea of how they can get it up and running.<br /></div><br /><br />Yes, this is what the getting started(or) programming section is for, explaining about common problems that you have to solve while programming for the nes.  There is many common one like:<br /><br />- compression<br />- Using mapper for more data<br />- How to organize data (interleaved, column based, screen based compressed etc)<br />- How to scroll an infinite map<br />- How to scroll with less artifact<br />- How to split the screen for a status bar<br />- How to do parallax scrolling with the scroll register<br />- How to keep state<br />- Frame based algorithm <br />- Trick of the trade from well known commercial games<br />- Graphic editing (map, tile etc)<br />- Music, how to make, to play, sound fx<br />- NMI, best practices (Dish already started a good document about this)<br />- etc etc<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">MetalSlime wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"><br />My hope is that the "Programming Mappers" section will one day be full of articles teaching you how to use each of the different mappers.<br /></div>  <br /><br />Yes. Once you understand a specific "breed" mapper, often many a related so we could group many type of mapper together too.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">MetalSlime wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"><br />I'm going to continue writing little articles like this and organizing them under the Programming page.  They aren't really going to be tutorials, but rather example solutions for specific, targeted problems.<br /></div><br /><br />It doesn't have to be a tutorial.

You can still learn from the old masters.<br /><br />I know there are people around with a huge amount of knowledge about specific games. Knowledge which currently, if shared at all, seems to be scattered throughout many different places.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=1377">miau</a> — Sun Jun 14, 2009 8:27 am</p><hr />

<div class="quotetitle">MetalSlime wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"><br />Yes, I think it's really useful personally, though of course it will be better once the rest of the articles are organized and accessible.<br /><br />I actually do most NES programming when I have free time at work, which is a place where I am not connected to the internet.  So an offline version of the wiki is actually pretty sweet for me personally.  I've been carrying around a lot of printouts stapled together, which makes my backpack heavier than it needs to be.  I can probably retire the papers now <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /></div><br /><br />Yes, still some work to do for the articles. Maybe the not organized one yet will just be set temporary in the getting started section until they can be put at the right place.<br /><br />The idea of a local version came to me because of 2 factors. Recently, the wiki was down randomly so it was annoying to not have access to the content when you really wanted it. That fix the first issue. The second one is I remember Tepples saying that he was programming while commuting (i.e. no internet access) so in that case, a local version is quite useful.<br /><br />With a local version, "printer friendly" sections are less useful but we can still make them for people that prefer paper.  Before you get rid of your paper version, make sure that all the content you need is there. <br /><br />Now we need to go through the content of nesdev files and add everything that is missing and is useful.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">miau wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"><br />hmm, that reminds me...<br />Has anyone ever had the idea of creating a "quick reference card" for the NES (like there is for unix commands, apache and a lot more stuff, even GB programming) that fits on a single (or just a few) sheets of paper? Always liked them. They make nice posters, too. <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /></div><br /><br />This could be an idea and it could be put on the wiki too.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">miau wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"><br />More on-topic:<br />Maybe it would be helpful to have a database of commercial and homebrew nes games in the wiki? E.g. each entry could have:<br /><ul>- general information on the right side like company, release date, - mapper used, prg and chr size and possibly more<br />- info for emulator developers: emulator requirements, things to pay attention to<br />- put a link to the corresponding entry at <a href="http://datacrystal.org" class="postlink">http://datacrystal.org</a> somewhere for ram/rom locations and a list of hacks</ul>Likely not enough points to warrant an article for each game, but maybe a single page for difficult-to-emulate games?<br />I just like having easily accessible in-depth info about games around. From a nesdev point of view that doesn't seem to make much sense, though, except for emulator developers.<br /><br />Well, it's just an idea.<br /></div><br /><br />I consider emu authors also nesdev developers since they contribute  emulators that will help for making new software so they should not be excluded. <br /><br />Any information about software made is ok too.  It's not like we have any space restriction or something <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /> The only problem is always "who" will fill that information.  Nothing was going forward about the wiki (i.e. the waiting game) so I took the time and moved everything.  Now I need people to contribute if we want the idea to fly. It should not be a one man army thing.<br /><br />Regarding a list of commercial games with their specification, yes this is an idea because I wanted to find some details about X game and the bootgod database was down (now it just went back up).  I would be useful a simple list of game N uses mapper X, board type X, has Y ammount of rom etc, anything that can be useful.
