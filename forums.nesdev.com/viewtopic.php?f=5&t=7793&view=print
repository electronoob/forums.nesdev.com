		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Hey, just wanted to note on here (rather than send out a bunch of PM's and posts everywhere), that I'll be out for a week or so.  My PC decided to start biting it (HD failure signs, then seemingly a videocard failure).  So it'll be almost a week by the time I get new parts in, and get everything up and running again.  Then maybe a bit longer for me to catch back up with stuff.
<br />
<br />I can still read the forum and post a little bit from work.
<br />
<br />My NES projects are just fine though, I didn't lose anything on the HD (yet, AFAIK).  The important stuff is backed up twice a day automatically.  But for this Seagate 1.5TB HDD, this will be the 3rd time I've had to send it in for replacement under warranty!  (first 2 times were when it was brand new).  So to remind everyone, if you don't already, keep backups!
<br />
<br />Unfortunately the vidcard I had, was built by BFGTech and they went out of business.  It would have been under warranty.
<br />
<br />Oh, and the week before, the power supply for my wife's laptop failed, also.  Still waiting on the replacement to arrive for that.  What a horrible week it's been for computer-running.  Only computer that still works is the one in my MAME cabinet. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />

Considering that, and that the BSOD error is "driver stuck in infinite loop" (for the video driver), hopefully that's all there is to it.

<br />Seemed wierd to have 2 things fail it once, but I guess really I'm actually not surprised by that HDD.

<br />
<br />That seems to happen to me all the time...
<br />For a long time everything works fine, and then BAM!
<br />All of the sudden everything seems to commit suicide at once.
<br />(Might be just me though...)
<br />
<br />A HDD that fails that often doesn't sound realiable. Never had a Seagate one and I think that'll stay like that...

<br />Your video driver issue may have something to do with the bad disk. Maybe one if the driver files has been damaged.

<br />
<br />I won't have a spare video card for 2-3 weeks (waiting on a Gigabyte RMA, re: <a href="http://koitsu.wordpress.com/2011/05/14/gv-n560oc-1gi-hardware-failure/" class="postlink">my GTX 560 Ti went bad</a>, with screenshots! :D), but if you want it let me know (though you'll have to pay for it, since it's basically new).

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Thanks koitsu, but I already ordered another drive and vidcard.  Figured I would back it all up before doing the RMA.  Then I'll have more storage than I'll know what to do with, heh.  Lots of old stuff, the NES folder has survived since 1996 (nes-lord, nesa.com and a few ROMs being the oldest).
<br />
<br />qbradq: My main drive is a solid-state type (which I'd recommend to anyone, it's totally worth the cost).  Unfortunately, crashes continued after removing the failing drive, and removing/reinstalling the drivers (also cleaned the heatsink and sped up the fan).

<br />I recommend mirroring or dropbox for critical data.

<br />
<br />As for failure rates, I am not too sure about the consumer grade drives, but the commercial drives from Intel have a failure rate around 0.03% per year for our disk arrays here at work. For comparison we see around a 6% per year failure rate for our disk-based drives, and those have a much lower I/O demand.

<br />
<br />SSDs are nice for OS/boot drives, though you get to deal with the 4KB/8KB page alignment ordeal -- you have to make sure your primary partition starts on a 4KB or 8KB boundary, or else your performance ends up sucking.  Vista and Windows 7 seem to do the "right thing" during partitioning, but 2K/XP requires manual intervention.

<br />
<br />That makes sense to me. We use Intel drives here at work. One thing I forgot to mention is that when I say an SSD "failed" I mean "failed prior to it's expected failure date" as specified by the manufacturer. These things do have limited erase cycles after all <img src="./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" />

<br />This makes me sad though. The SSD I have is an OCZ  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_mad.gif" alt=":x" title="Mad" />

I had to reinstall the OS to use AHCI mode, otherwise it would BSOD instantly.  I don't know how much worse the performance would be without all that, since I did the special formatting / alignment thing and enabled AHCI mode before using it much.
<br />
<br />Now when loading Civ 5, instead of having a black screen for about 3 minutes, now it's more like 15 - 20 seconds.
<br />
<br />Heh, my SSD is an OCZ also.  Oh well, the failure modes for an SSD aren't too bad.  Though I guess with a magnetic disk the control board could get totally fried and the disk would still be readable (just replace the control board).
<br />
<br />Oh btw, stuff isn't done blowing up around here yet.  Today our refrigerator started putting out a nasty burning rubber smell.  No prob, got ice and a big cooler and a cheap fridge on the horizon, but holy shit, heheh.
