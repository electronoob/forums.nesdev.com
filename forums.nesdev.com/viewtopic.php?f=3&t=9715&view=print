		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Hey guys, I currently have my 6502 emulator passing all the nestest tests without any errors.<br /><br />However, when I was fixing bugs I came across a problem with <strong>one </strong>of the BNE instructions in nestest. I figured out what was happening: When I was &quot;jumping&quot; I was adding the immediate directly to the program counter (PC += immediateByte).<br /><br />I realized that it was wrong because the highest significant bit would <strong>wrap-around</strong>, so I fixed the bug this way:<br /><br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">this.PC = (UInt16)((this.PC &amp; 0xFF00) | ((this.PC + immediateByte) &amp; 0xFF));</div><br /><br />And after that it worked all right... So I replicated that line in all the other Branches and removed the old (PC+=immediateByte) code.<br /><br />But when I do this to all the other branches, nestest starts failing. :/ So I kept it only at the BNE. Today I loaded another NES ROM and it was also messing up with the jumps, so I also replaced the BPL to do the wrap-around.<br /><br />Now, obvisouly there is something REALLY wrong here. :/ Do you guys have any ideas? Am I missing something about the branch instructions? Oh by the way, when I say &quot;PC&quot; I mean the PC at the beggining of the instruction.<br /><br />Thank you guys!

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I'm surprised your emulator passed all the CPU tests, as I'm sure there's one that catches this bug. You should simply be adding the operand byte interpreted as a signed 8-bit value. Since a (two's complement) byte simply has a negative weight for the top bit (-128), you can portably convert an unsigned to signed with (n^0x80)-0x80.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />For a taken branch, you need to compute both the address that you'd get from 16-bit addition to the sign-extended value and the address that you'd get from 8-bit wraparound. If the two addresses match, the branch is 3 cycles; otherwise, it's 4 cycles, with one of the cycles being an unused fetch from the 8-bit wraparound address. (Not taken branches are always 2 cycles.) Either way, execution resumes at the address resulting from 16-bit addition.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Yes, but somehow, that didn't happen and it would jump to the right line... which is odd, probably just &quot;coincidence&quot;.<br /><br />You see, I created my own &quot;test function&quot;. I made a function to parse nestest.log that generates a similar file containing only the registers in each line (removing scanlines, disasm, etc), so I compare nestest log line by line with the output of my cpu. When the strings are different, I output them both, and the line number in nestest.log. I could reach the end, even with that bug.<br /><br />Still no PPU, though. Also haven't tested the instructions timing yet.<br /><br />Thanks again! <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />

The PPU produces a new pixel, or dot, every four master clocks. One CPU cycle is twelve master clocks. CYC in the nestest log counts dots. So every time CYC increases by three, the CPU performs one cycle of work.
