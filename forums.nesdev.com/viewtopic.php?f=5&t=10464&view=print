Yes you are probably right, and I'd never get the competence of writing a web browser, so it's very easy for me to do blind criticism.<br /><br /><em>However</em>, I still think it sucks that browsers tend to leak memory so much. But at least knowing the problem is good enough, I could explain a colleague why a PC he left on with both Firefox and Chrome running for a whole week ended up having some serious lagging problems at resume (with 100% of memory used and disc caching enabled etc etc...)

Also, <a href="http://kb.mozillazine.org/Memory_Leak" class="postlink">Reducing [Firefox] memory usage</a>.<br /><br />If blame is to be laid, I lay it squarely on website designers who bloat these things beyond recognition, slowing down multi-hundred-MHz smartphone web browsers. That is what requires such sophisticated web browsers that implementations are complex enough to leave unsolved memory leaks and need lots of caching and other memory-intensive approaches to running at an acceptable speed.

I regularly have Firefox open continuously for days. I'm not sure why you think this. At various times, various builds of each of the major browsers have had serious flaws, often manifesting for only a small subset of users, perhaps you had a bad experience with Firefox at some point, but it will hardly &quot;destroy any computer&quot;. I've had builds of Chrome, Firefox, and Opera that failed to run well for me at the time, but in general I think all three of them are kept in good working order most of the time (not sure about Opera these days, haven't used it regularly in the last few years).<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">koitsu wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">This is just how a lot of software is today -- &quot;our&quot; days of KISS and minimal resource usage are pretty much over; we're a dying breed of peoples.

This included very simple web pages from the 90s and would go to the point where one page was using over a gigabyte. I think part of the problem had to do with trying to cache every single decoded frame of an animation as it was running, even when it was offscreen.

Doing this is a specialized skill, and it's not needed for most cases. The majority of people take the naive path, and either don't have a problem at all because their task is incomplex, or don't notice the poor performance of their stuff because it's not really an issue to them, and/or they don't care about how it runs on more limited platforms that they don't use themselves.<br /><br />For example, the recently released Hate Plus visual novel game has horrendous performance, and it uses all available CPU on its thread at all times even though it is largely just static screens of text. It causes a mild annoyance for people playing it (lag between input and feedback, jerky transitions, etc.), and I suppose causes a waste of electricity, heats up my laptop and gets that fan going annoyingly loud, etc. but it doesn't make the game non-functional at all. All these things annoy me, and the issue is probably really easy to fix for a programmer who is specialized in optimization, but it's not enough of a problem that its author is going to solve it. I'm not trying to single out Hate Plus, it's just an example-- a great deal of indie games have very poor performance for what they do.<br /><br />There have always been programs and games and websites that run slowly and use way too much memory. Yes, resources were a bit tighter in the past, but the result was just that people managed to accomplish less complicated things before they hit their performance barrier. There was never a good old days when people cared more about performance, that's always been specialized.
