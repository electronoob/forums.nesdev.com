<br />
<br />The SNES PowerPak came in the mail today, and I can't believe how amazing a device it is. It works perfectly on my 2/1/3 SNES (PAL). Of course, I have no idea how long it will operate as well as it does now, but for as long as it does I'm going to be a fully satisfied customer.
<br />
<br />Everything works, the PowerPak, the card reader, the card itself, the DSP-1...
<br />
<br />Way to go, bunnyboy!
<br />
<br />Ah, by the way... I got a 2GB card instead of the 1GB one I paid for! If you're reading this, bunnyboy, please tell me if you want me to reimburse you for the difference in price.
<br />
<br />P.S. In case you haven't had the chance to use a CF card yet (like me), be careful when putting the card in the reader, so as not to pull out/push in any pins in the reader's slot - push the card in as straight as possible.

<br />I am getting the exact same error. I formatted the card to FAT32 with winxp and loaded the POWERPAK dir to the root directory of the CF Card. I am using a Sandisk Ultra 8gb CF card. What does this error mean exactly?
<br />
<br />Also, I tried 3 different snes model 1's. All had the same error.

		<td><b>Battery RAM broken for US NTSC v1 SNES rev 1/1/1 consoles?</b></td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Hey guys, I'm a member over at Digital Press and thought I'd bring up a "bug" I'm encountering with my PowerPak
<br />
<br />With over 20 different games good (U)! dumps I have not been able to reach the SNES PowerPak Saving battery RAM screen. Holding RESET for 5 seconds keeps the game playing until I let go in which that time the game resets like it would normally do with a real cartridge. Thus, I am unable to update Battery RAM onto the CF card. This problem is repeatable over and over for me on PowerPak(NTSC CIC DSP1 Installed) 1.02/1.02 on an NTSC US v1 SNES rev 1/1/1.
<br />
<br />I am using a properly setup(with DMA=1 working fine) FAT32 PNY Optima Pro 4 GB 133x CompactFlash Memory Card P-CF4GB-133W-DVDC with premade 8kb .srm files from the Retrousb site.
<br />
<br />This problem however does not exhibit itself on my US NTSC v1 SNES rev 2/1/2. During holding of RESET the screen immediately switches to black with my proper video 2 channel indication(as I'm assuming from change of resolution) instead of the game continuously  playing. Upon release of RESET I'm greeted with the Save Battery RAM to CF Card screen as I should be.
<br />
<br />So... bug for rev 1/1/1 systems for the time being? Anyone else here have a 1/1/1 system to test this on? I believe pre 1.02 there were DMA/HDMA problems with 1/1/1 systems?
<br />
<br />Greatly appreciated,
<br />
<br />jupitersj

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I got my PowerPak a couple weeks ago, and I feel like I've used it enough to report on some things.
<br />
<br />My Super Famicom Jr. doesn't work with it (big surprise).  So I went back to my dad's to get my regular Super Famicom, and while there, I tested it in my US SNES (NOT an SNES2, though I don't know what model/revision it is).  Strangely enough, the menus tended to lock up on the SNES, and even when they didn't, I couldn't get anything to run.
<br />
<br />It runs like a charm on my Super Famicom though, and everything I've thrown at it works.  All in all, I'd say I'm 95% satisfied - the only things I could have asked for would be better hardware compatibility (but again, I have it working, so no biggie, and I'm sure this will improve with time) and maybe a USB-in port (to further encourage homebrew development).
<br />
<br />Personally, I got this for RPGs (to avoid the loss of battery saves) and the potential for homebrew (though I haven't seen much yet), and I can read Japanese, so I haven't messed with any hacks.  As such, I'm obviously not going to have as many problems with weird ROMs as many of the other non-devs who bought this.  But I can at least add that the Star Ocean fix posted by renejr902 and others works fine on the Japanese Neviksti version as well, though I doubt that's a big surprise to anyone.  I agree that it would be neat if someone converted Street Fighter Zero/Alpha 2 in the same way as Star Ocean (if only to improve compatibility by one game), but I have the original cart, and there is no save data (or at least I don't think there is), so personally I'm not that concerned.

FFIIUS is actually harder in some respects than regular FFIV - for example, Dark Wave is convenient for taking out large groups of enemies at the very beginning.  And just try getting a Pink Tail in FFIIUS! <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />  You may think FFIV is hard<strong>er</strong> than FFIIUS, but that doesn't make it <strong>hard</strong> - it's still a pretty middle-of-the-road RPG for its time, I'd say, especially compared to FFIII (ugh, the final dungeon!).<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">renejr902 wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">You CANT  compare these 2 games.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Hi guys, I'm just a visitor here, sharing a problem I've got with my SNES PowerPak which arrived last week. I get some errors and have not been able to get any games running on it, but it works fine on my friends SNES, which I found unusual, since his is the exact same model as mine. Both our systems are european (PAL) and were sold in AustraLia. They are both in good working order.
<br />
<br />Here's my SNES system details...
<br />
<br />Serial Number: UP18110013
<br />Model No.: SNSP-001A(AUS)
<br />Rating: AC9V 1.3A
<br />
<br />Errors at power on... "DSP1 not installed" (it is installed)... "SDRAM error"
<br />
<br />Cannot get any games running but attempting to load, I get the following... "Copying game... Game copied... Checking BRAM....(some text)... "No Internal Header Found... Check game list......"
<br />
<br />And my friends system, which it seems to work ok, though possibly a bit picky with the games and locked up a couple of times on loading a game.
<br />
<br />Serial Number: UP16517792
<br />Model No.: SNSP-001A(AUS)
<br />Rating: AC9V 1.3A
<br />
<br />Anyway, hope that info is of use to someone. I've just ordered myself a retro duo v2 system so I'm counting on that to fix my problem for the time being, though I will be checking for software updates as I would rather be using it with my SNES.
