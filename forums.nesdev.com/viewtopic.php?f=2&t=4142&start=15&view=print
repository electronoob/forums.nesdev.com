<br />
<br />It's probably easy now that he's coded it, just as it's kind of easy now that I've coded my scrolling engine. I had such a hard time coding it before, but I have it set up so I can -easily- stick it in almost any game that I make that will scroll. And by the way, "crying around" sounds a little harsh, if you want to know.
<br />
<br />I do agree that people might get all bitter and angry since money is involved, but also, money kind of insures that there will be progress in the project. And if there are many people involved, the project should move along fairly quickly. If it's a simple NROM side scroller, it might not take long at all.
<br />
<br />I wouldn't even feel bad if I didn't get paid. The only time I'd get annoyed/angry is if I OWED money. If I don't get any, it's not like I'm any worse of than before.

I seriously don't recall "crying" about the scrolling, as that was completed pretty smoothly.

Find these posts where I "cried" about my scrolling system, I'd like to see that. BTW, even if I did have trouble blanking a part of the screen, that'd not be a problem when side scrolling. And even if there were any scrolling problems at some point, Celius is right, it may just be easy now because the engine is ready, although this isn't the case.

<br />Well, you were kind of a dick when you said I was "crying around". That's the first effect of the involvement of money I have noticed. My response to you was probably the second.
<br />
<br />Seriously, I don't need more money, I can work on plenty of stuff for money. It's just that it would be nice to be paid to program the NES for a change, so I'm interested in hearing more. And when I say "more", I'm actually more interested in what kind of game ideas he has than on how much he's going to pay.

<br />
<br />I honestly think that it may have been a misunderstanding of how offensive "crying around" sounds, so I wouldn't take it to personally/literally.
<br />
<br />I think I'd be more interested in what kind of game would be made rather than the money involved, like Tokumaru said. We'll have to learn a little more about the project from the author though.

It's just that when I said scrolling was an easy part of writing a game engine you replied you disagreed and that was complicated if you did it during gameplay, as I don't do it during gameplay. And now you said it was easy. I guess once you did it it's always easy, as Celius said.
<br />
<br />Anyway yeah we have to learn more from the author, as I still doubt he was that "serious". Honnestly, who would suddently produce and sell hundreds/thousands of NES games and pay unknown people to do the job all of sudden without being even an already known game developper ?

<br />Why would a well known game developer pay others to make a game instead of making it himself? There is nothing strange about a person paying to have a NES game made, as long as this person likes the NES and the type of game in question, but lacks the knowledge to program it himself.

So you may have to show what's special about this one, to get the attention being sought.
<br />
<br />I can do programming, sound, hardware design and manufacturing, general advice.  But I'd have to know why to get interested and involved.  I don't think anyone here does it for the money.

<br />
<br />The amounts payed wont be huge,but just so that the project would move
<br />along on a nice pace and not take 2 years to complete =)
<br />I don't think this should create rivalry, at the festival in London i worked with artists who's works sell for thousands of dollars yet there is no rivalry..
<br />we can all respect each other i think for the we do and our personal devotion just as here on this forum.
<br />Of course people's drive shouldnt be the money alone =)
<br />
<br />Right now i just want to know who the people are who have the skills and then adress those people with more details..
<br />
<br />Thanks again everybody!

<br />Yeah, but having a job is supposed to gives you a hard time everyday, and in the end you are paid for you bothering all the day with more or less annoying stuff. Of course not all jobs are that annoying, but overall if you could live with a job or without any job and without the financial and social consequences that this have, most people would chose to not have a job. Hower, if that would happen everybody would do nothing, and in the end everyone would die hungried as nobody would cultivate/sell food for everyone.
<br />
<br />What I mean is that you usually don't be paid to have fun (okay there is soccer players who are paid bilions to kick a ball). NES coding can be both fun and annoying at the same time, but overall it's a lot more fun than annoying, and there is probably more people that would like code a NES game than people that would buy it.
<br />
<br />Now back on the subject, you still didn't mention what skills you are exactly looking for. After you've done a whole load of routines it's not hard to copy/paste them and modify them to be used in a different game. However, probably for example tokumaru's routines and tepple's routines have few in common with mines, while not being better or worse, and megre them would be almost impossible due to the low-level nature of assembly language.
<br />
<br />Personally I have probably skills to code a game of decent simplicity, altrouht I haven't released any game yet so I'd feel bad showing off I'm able to code a game. But I have a complete game engine, which has it's limits, but is still complete. I have no skills if you need something like artificial intelligence or something like that.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Yeah, that's another thing. We all code so differently, with different goals in mind. For example, some people make code that will be space-efficient, but have its limits. I'm the type of person who codes trying so hard not to have any limits on anything. I try to make everything as universal and open-ended as possible. However, I don't really have much to show off, because the only game I ever showed anyone was this piece of garbage simply called "The Game" which probably wouldn't even run on the NES because it's coded so sloppily. I believe on my site you can find it, the link's in my signature. But don't worry, my coding style has changed drastically since then.
<br />
<br />We also are all used to different assemblers. So a project where we are all working together would be a little complicated, as I understand lots of people around here use assembler-specific macros and stuff.
<br />
<br />EDIT: Are signatures not showing anymore? I can't see anyone's... If you're REALLY interested, just click on the www button.
