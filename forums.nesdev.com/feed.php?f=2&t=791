$5104 can be changed as will, and maybe $5100-$5103 also can, but (probably) all known games does change it only on startup, that doesn't mean that it isn't allowed, that means that it could not be allowed.<br />I'm not totally sure about mode 0 and what it does, but I think that $5c00-$5ffff will just be used as a third nametable, swappable in via $5105 by written logic 2 to one of the four nametable spcace. In that mode, write trough $5c00-$5fff must be done during rendering, but you can also write to it via normal nametable writes via $2006/7 out of rendering. Mode 0 is the most obsure one for me at least, so I'm not very sure about everything.<br /><br />In mode 1, nametable 2 can also be swapped in for use, but the result isn't usefull, scince the attributes/high 14-bits index will be read from the same loction as the low 8-bit index, so this isn't of any use (exept if you want to write to EXGrafix RAM via $2007 in VBlank, I'm not even sure that would work, but it probably would).<br />In practice, you'll most probably want to use mode 1 to only have one-screen miroring, and the low values would be done trough one of the normal values, and the high values trough ExGraphix RAM via $5c00-$5ffff.<br /><br />Mode 2 works for regular RAM, but it can be usefull if you want to write to EXRAM during VBlank, because the PPU cannot acess it it will work, unlike mode 0 and 1.<br /><br />Mode 3 is read-only RAM, writing to it has no effect. I have no idea about how it could be used in practice, maybe just for read content of EXRam during rendering without risk of corruption with the PPU ?<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=38">Bregalad</a> — Fri Dec 16, 2005 9:43 am</p><hr />

Wait, no known MMC5 games write more than once at reset to $5100-$5103. I didn't check that myself, but if I remember right J2 told me that, meaning that change PRG bankwitching or CHR bankwitching size any time *may* not work fine. This was just a notice, I'd recomend to make test on hardware to make sure changing CHR banks size cause no problems before doing that.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=38">Bregalad</a> — Thu Dec 15, 2005 10:21 am</p><hr />

OK, Disch, thanks for clarifying this. I thought that maybe $5130 was sort of "active" on the loaded CHR banks. It is a very good thing it works the way you said.

That must be the most weird thing I've ever heard about the NES (the fact that ExRAM writes work exactly in the opposite way as PPU memory).<br /><br />Now, I have a somewhat unrelated question to ask. If any of you could answer it, that would be great! The question is about address $5130 of MMC5. I understand it is used for the high bits when you're swiching small CHR banks in, and also used to define wich 256kb bank to get tiles from when in extended attribute mode. But are these related? I mean, the tiles mapped into the pattern tables must be from the same 256kb page as the BG?<br /><br />The document Disch pointed me to says: "The upper 2 bits are stored when the register is written to, and their value is determined by 5130" wich makes me think that, regarding bankswitching,  the value at $5130 is only important at the exact time the switching happens. Is that how it really works? Or must all graphics belong to the same 256kb page?<br /><br />Thanks for the help, again!<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=95">tokumaru</a> — Wed Dec 14, 2005 5:32 pm</p><hr />

Yeah, writing to EXRAM during rendering works just fine, Just Beed does this A LOT (and my game will too).<br />Doing it during VBlank will NOT work, all your writes will write the value $00 instead. That's doing it the other way arround than PPU acess. In other words, you can only acess PPU or EXRAM, but never both at the same time.<br />However, if you change something in EXRAM that the PPU is just displaying, you may get glitches. I'm not sure about that, but the first and last 8 scanlines are  safe on a standard NTSC system (however, glitches may still be here on a PAL system).<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=38">Bregalad</a> — Wed Dec 14, 2005 10:34 am</p><hr />

Interestingly enough, ExRAM, while in mode 1, can only be written (via $5C00-$5FFF) <strong>while rendering</strong> - if you try to write during VBLANK (or while rendering is disabled), the data won't make it through properly.<br /><br />Regarding Fill Mode, it's a very handy way to instantly produce a solid screen of a particular color (since you can change all of the tiles and all of the attribute bits each with a single write). Laser Invasion/Gun Sight uses this in numerous places where it scrolls an image in from a solid screen - namely, at the titlescreen animation, taking off into the flying areas of levels, and boss battles in said flying areas.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=7">Quietust</a> — Tue Dec 13, 2005 12:47 pm</p><hr />

If you keep ExRAM in mode 0 or 1, the PPU will get the proper values from ExRAM when read.<br /><br />Interestingly, modes 0, 1, and 2 are all CPU writable (but only mode 2 is CPU readable).  So that leads me to believe that it <em>would</em> be possible to easily change tiles around by messnig with $5C00-5FFF during rendering (if you're using ExRAM as a 3rd nametable in mode 0)... although somehow I find it hard to believe that would work.<br /><br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"><br />Logic says it is possible, right? Since we're not messing directly with the PPU, we're messing with what is sent to the PPU... but not always the NES follows any logic. =)<br /></div><br /><br />I don't really know enough about hardware to really analyze the logic... but the idea of RAM being accessed by two different areas at the same time (worse yet... one read and one write at the same time) would cause conflicts and potentially corrupt one of the accesses.<br /><br />It wouldn't suprise me at all if the MMC5 contained the hardware to sort all that out and allow you to access everything during rendering.  But at the same time it wouldn't suprise me at all if you couldn't write during rendering.  I'm afraid I can't give you a definative answer on this one =/<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=33">Disch</a> — Tue Dec 13, 2005 12:46 pm</p><hr />
