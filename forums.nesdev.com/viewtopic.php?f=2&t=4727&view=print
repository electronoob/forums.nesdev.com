		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I've been trying to figure out a way to hide scrolling glitches again, something that has already been discussed in topics such as <a href="http://nesdev.com/bbs/viewtopic.php?t=4424" class="postlink">this</a> and <a href="http://nesdev.com/bbs/viewtopic.php?t=4320" class="postlink">this</a>). I was trying to come up with a new method that didn't require IRQs or special mappers (i.e. NROM-friendly) and didn't require a lot of sprites (like <em>Alfred Chicken</em> or <em>Felix the Cat</em> do). I was also trying to avoid relying on obscure PPU behavior (such as $2004 reads), but something's gotta give.
<br />
<br />The only obscure thing I need is to change the scrolling through $2005/$2006 in the middle of a frame, which isn't such an obscure trick, as it's already known for a long time. I decided to ask this in a new thread because this isn't necessarily related to scrolling glitches.
<br />
<br />Anyway, does anyone know the protocol for safely resetting the scroll to any point in the name tables? I do understand Loopy's scrolling documents and know how to modify the registers, what I need to know is the correct time to modify them. Can that be done during HBLANK without the need for turning rendering off? Are there any problems regarding the two tiles that are fetched in the previous scanline (glitches)?
<br />
<br />Also, if anyone can point me to a game that has done this and is proven to work on hardware without glitches, that'd be great. Thanks for the help.
<br />
<br />If my idea is proven to work, I'll be sure to describe it here later.

<br />
<br />First, I write the 113.666 cycle loop, then I put a delay before it starts, messing around with the start delay timing until it all lines up.
<br />
<br />In the progam I'm working on now, here's part of the loop for writing the regs each scanline:

<br />I can give you those tables if you want them.
<br />
<br />I think Fantastic Adventures of Dizzy was one game that did a lot of mid-frame scroll writes in the intro.  Either that, or another Dizzy game.

<br />In that code, scroll_table is in RAM and basically defines which scanline to draw for every line.

<br />I don't really care about the power-up state, since I just safely wait for 2 frames to go by before doing anything... this is all a game programmer has to know! =) What I'm aiming for here is manipulating the scroll as the screen renders.

<br />Well, you asked <em>when in the scanline that first write to $2006 occurs</em>. <strong>My</strong> bad, because you mentioned that custom code. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_neutral.gif" alt=":|" title="Neutral" />

<br />You know, you should add that to the wiki. It's not too technical and lets people know what's possible on the NES. I haven't checked the demos though.
