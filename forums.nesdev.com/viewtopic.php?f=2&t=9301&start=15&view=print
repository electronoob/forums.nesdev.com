		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />The main problem with the OAMADDR method is that it is not very effective at changing the order of your sprites. Effectively you're just dividing your original list in to two halves, and each half is in the same order it was before. So, if your 9-sprite-line is completely on either side of your list, it won't get broken up. If you are cycling through all possible addresses, any 9-sprite-line will eventually flicker, but it may take several frames to change.<br /><br />If I was using this method, and presumed all sprites could be treated equally, I would probably add 156 to my starting address each frame. This number is 39 * 4 bytes, and 39 is relatively prime to 64, so over 64 frames it will start on every possible address, but it's also large enough to significantly change the split point each frame, and over short periods of time it has good coverage of the available spaces (i.e. nicely spread out). I picked 39 specifically because it was relatively prime and close to the golden ratio, which is <a href="http://www.brpreiss.com/books/opus4/html/page214.html" class="postlink">effective for spread</a>. The goal is to maximize the address change from frame to frame so that the split point is likely to break and unbreak 9-sprite-lines more frequently.<br /><br />(edited to correct error pointed out by bregalad)

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Oh right, let me correct that... (fixed, see above)<br /><br />Also, my suggestion is for a generic case (all sprites considered equal), but your sprite usage will undoubtably have patterns in it, for which a better solution tuned to those patterns might be found.

	<tr>
		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Sprites are discarded based on their OAM position, so this is to cycle the OAM positions so that you have a rapid flicker across all the sprites rather than just completely losing them entirely past the 8th?<br /><br />And the DMA is able to auto wrap both the PPU OAM and the source page?<br /><br />Also getting used to 8 bit is weird.  Seeing odd addresses like $17 makes me scream inside but there is no penalty on the 6502 <img src="./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" />

	<tr>
		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />You can generalize various ideas to flicker sprites so everyone gets a turn being drawn but if you know your game you can probably optimize the situation. Since different games will have different ways in which sprite drop will cause problems you may have different solutions. You can prioritize how you wish to fill the OAM table, even perform logic to try to optimize the order of filling it based on game objects in play.
