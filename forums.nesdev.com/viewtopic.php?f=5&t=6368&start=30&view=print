<br />Yeah that's exactly what most people used to call it here. Although now that emulator became common, and because they are all called "NES emulators", people start referring the system to as "NES" too.
<br />
<br />Kinda the same for the original Playstation. Everybody called it Playstation, but because emulator emulating this system are calling themselves "PSX emulators" people starts refering to the system as the "PSX". I don't like that name tough, where the f**k does this 'X' come from ?

<br />So if you mention the "NES" in Argentina almost no one will know what you are talking about, you have to say "Nintendo" or "Family"

<br />
<br />Since in your country people speak another language it sounds quite possible that "Family" refers to something that has nothing to do with the English name "family". Here in French we says "baskets" for sneakers, basket is a word imported from English language and has nothing to do with sneakers. There is probably a reason why this word was "wrongly imported" (okay you have to wear sneakers to play basketball but is it really a reason ?).
<br />I'm pretty sure a few other English words were wrongly imported in French as well (along with the many, many, many english words which are imported "correctly" and this effect got even more accelerated since everyone visit internet sites in Enlish daily).

<br />Well in Spain, I believe, and other spanish speaking countries, they call them the "Tenis", which is basically the same as your example.

After Nintendo and Sony parted ways, Sony revamped the architecture as the "Play Station Experiment" (PSX) which became the PlayStation. The header for a PlayStation program even starts out "PS-X EXE".<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">Here in French we says "baskets" for sneakers, basket is a word imported from English language and has nothing to do with sneakers.

<br />Basketball has something in common with tennis: quick back and forth motion. Shoes for this motion were originally called "tennis shoes", as Petruza mentioned. But lately, shoe stores have been calling them "court shoes" because both basketball and lawn tennis are played on a "court".

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Yeah, PSX and NES don't have anything to do with emulators, they were called that back in the day too.  I have an old Mario comic from the early 90s and on the back it has an ad that says to "play Beetlejuice, Beetlejuice, Beetlejuice, on your NES, NES, NES."  And tepples is right about the PSX being its internal abbreviation that became public.
<br />
<br />Mainly, people don't call it the Nintendo anymore because there are lots of Nintendo consoles now.  I think the abbreviations came into more common use in the Super Nintendo era, to differentiate.

<br />I know this is off topic they should of really came up with an acronym for Wii to stand for, that would have made me more accepting of its name.
