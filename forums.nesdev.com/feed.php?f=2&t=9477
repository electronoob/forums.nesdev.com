Desoldering DIP chips isn't too difficult. It does just need some patience, but there isn't much that could go wrong (like destroying the chip, or producing shortcuts, after all, you are removing the solder). I could desolder it, but I am in Hamburg/germany, and the piano is probably a bit clumsy for shipping, unless you find somebody in the same city.<br /><br />For anybody doing it: One would need a soldering iron (to melt the solder), some fresh solder (helps if the old solder is sticky). And some desoldering tool <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desoldering">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desoldering</a><!-- m --> - I am normally using a spring-loaded Desoldering Pump (around $5). Other people appear to prefer using Desoldering Braid (also cheap, I never got good results with that method though).<br /><br />Yes, after desoldering/dumping, the chip could be soldered back in within a few minutes, or one could invest 10-20 cents on a socket.<br /><br />PS. Just read the wikipedia stuff myself, and learned something new - <em>Short lengths of cut braid will prevent heat being carried away by the braid instead of heating the joint.</em> - maybe that's why it never worked for me. I'll try cutting short pieces next time.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=5211">nocash</a> — Fri Feb 13, 2015 9:03 pm</p><hr />

Looks like version 2 was done so they didn't need so many components on the board?  Resistor city on version 1.<br />I wonder if version 2 supports different volume levels per channel?

Well, when you open the Miracle Piano, the mainboard model is silkscreened on the mainboard (800951 or 800961) and the firmware version is printed on the EPROM (OS-1.10 or OS-2.03).<br /><br />You can also check the firmware version using a SysEx command as documented in the manual. Since the two known firmware EPROMs are not interchangeable, you can confirm which mainboard you have without opening the piano.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=5948">Joe</a> — Wed Jan 14, 2015 10:58 pm</p><hr />

I'm glad to see someone can benefit from this. <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_lol.gif" alt=":lol:" title="Laughing" /><br /><br />It looks like there's another important difference between OS-1.10 and OS-2.03: the volume control. In OS-1.10, the volume level is controlled by the keyboard ASIC. The ASIC outputs an analog level that is used to amplitude-modulate the audio. In OS-2.03, the keyboard ASIC is always forced to output the value for maximum volume, and the volume control is instead handled digitally (by modifying the commands sent to the synthesizer).<br /><br />The next time I open up my Miracle Piano, I'm going to check to see if it has an analog volume control or not.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=5948">Joe</a> — Wed Jan 14, 2015 2:09 pm</p><hr />
