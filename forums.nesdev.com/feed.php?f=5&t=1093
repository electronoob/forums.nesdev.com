Regarding the Rat Race:<br /><br />There are tricks.  If you can time it right (things have to be just so), you can punch the rate as you fall and he'll turn around.  Usually this does more harm than good, but it can work out if you know what you're doing.  You can also time it so the 3rd rat will hit those moving platforms at just the wrong time -- giving you an early substantial lead, making that 3rd section much easier.<br /><br />The Rat Race is by FAR my favorite level in that game.  The music, the feeling of urgency, everything about it is just awesome -- one of the few games that still gets my heart pumping when I play it.<br /><br />Anyway -- I've pretty much mastered Battletoads.  I can consistently go through it with no game overs (maxed out score of 999999 by Clinger Winger or earlier, usually, but I don't pay that much attention to my score).  Not counting The Revolution and bosses, I'd say I die on average 5 times per runthrough (now that I think about it, that might even be a generous estimate -- it's probably more like 2 or 3).  Revolution still gives me some trouble sometimes, and the Storm Trooper at the top of the Elevator shaft still kicks my ass now and then.<br /><br />Never the 5-life code -- never warp -- never abuse savestates.  ;D<br /><br />EDIT  --   Also...<br /><br />I don't know if this has been mentioned -- but getting through the game with two players isn't <em>virtually</em> impossible -- it actually IS impossible.  There's a fatal glitch in Clinger Winger where the second player cannot move and all and he'll just get killed by the spiral guy right as the level starts every time.  I've gotten there with a friend a few times before (with heavy savestate abuse as my friend kind of sucks).<br /><br />An online guy I know, Drag, experienced this problem as well and looked into it.  Apparently each toad is given a counter that starts counting down every frame --  and the toad cannot move until that counter reaches zero.  The problem is, the counter doesn't start counting until the toad gets to his Clinger thing -- and Zitz (second toad) doesn't get to his Clinger thing until several frames AFTER Rash (1P) gets to his -- so his timer is still counting down even after Rash, and the spiral enemy, are already on the move.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=33">Disch</a> — Mon May 29, 2006 6:13 pm</p><hr />

I definitely think the inferno level is the toughest one of them.  You pretty much have to memorize EXACTLY where all the openings are.  The last time I played this game I was attempting to go through it with no warps, but whenever I got through the inferno, I just didn't have enough lives for the rest of the game <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_confused.gif" alt=":?" title="Confused" />  I'll have to give it another shot sometime soon.<br /><br />As for scoring, you can actually max your score out on the level where you fight Robo-Manus.  When you see one of the areas that shoot out those balls, you can stand there and have a turbo button held down for a long time ... 999,999 if I remember correctly.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=174">Roth</a> — Sat Feb 11, 2006 9:07 am</p><hr />
