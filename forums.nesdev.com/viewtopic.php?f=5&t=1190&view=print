<br />
<br />Technically you can make a 1kB ROM, just push it all up into the $Fxxx address and higher.  Just that iNES format doesn't like that, has to be padded, no big deal.
<br />
<br />I experimented with all kinds of crazy crap when I was working on my minigames.  Like uncompressing the whole program into RAM (wasn't too effective with RLE, worked great for some data though).  And my favorite (and probably the most useful) was using zeropage RAM as the sprite RAM.  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />
<br />
<br />I doubt I'll have one ready for this year, but who knows.

<br />Doing such will force you to put everyother variables out of zero page RAM, so you'll most probably have it wasting space.
<br />Also, it makes lda [$xx],Y totally forbidden, unless you reserve some zero page for pointers that correspond to sprite ram tile number and palette, and make sure that the vertical position byte previous to it is always $f0.
<br />This is fool, however. Such small size limitation are not fair to make good games. Being able to spare size is usefull in the life, tough.

<br />You lose only 25% theoretical RAM efficiency doing it this way, as you can steal the tile, attribute, and X value of each sprite. Heck, as anything from $F0 to $FF works, you could use one hidden sprite's X value and the next hidden sprite's Y value to make an indirect ROM address in $F000 on up.

<br />
<br />But I don't think I'll want to give up on compression. Just didn't think of the best compression scheme for 2-bit bitmaps yet. It will come to me.
<br />
<br />Good to know a 32kb ROM won't be a problem. I guess 16kb would just be cleaner, so I still want to know what mappers/boards would work with that and CHR-RAM.

<br />If you want to wire up a board with CHR RAM to take a 16 KB PRG EPROM, then UNROM or Camerica with A14-A16 not connected is by far the most common one. SNROM and SUROM would work too. I'd imagine that BNROM would work too, as the lower bank would just get mirrored.
