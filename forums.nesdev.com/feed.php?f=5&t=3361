Kevin Horton made a NES FPGA that is allegedly pretty close to perfect, to hear him tell it at least. But the microcontroller is probably way too expensive for most famicom clone makers, when they can just as easily keep doing what they're doing, and profit from it .. most people don't seem to really care if it's exactly right if they're not a retro gaming fanatic like us. So except for companies like Messiah who get a big kick out of hyping the shit out of "Resurrecting the NES" I doubt they'd really care as long as it sells. Messiah clearly didn't care either because they just bought a random crappy clone and resold it with a lot of hype, to appeal to people who didn't know any better and didn't know about the massive clone market.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=2974">Epicenter</a> — Thu May 17, 2007 7:14 pm</p><hr />

Comparing the Yobo/Neo Fami side by side with the "Famulator" (another popular FC clone, at least in Japan), as well as a genuine FC Model 2, I noted the Famulator had superior audio reproduction and very little to no slowdown that wasn't present on the real machine. However the Neo Fami had the worst audio in my mini-roundup, and there was a surprising slowdown issue. In fact it was so bad some parts of games became unplayable, such as the final boss battle in Hoshi no Kirby/Kirby's Adventure.<br /><br />I'm curious how they ended up with a "slow" FOAC and why if so many variants are being made, why no one is making an effort to improve the technology. I guess it's because the ~15 year old FOAC designs work well enough to sell Famicom clones, and the differences can just be chalked up to discrepancies in cloning clone chips, cloned from the FC. <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt=":roll:" title="Rolling Eyes" /><br /><br />Something good at least to be said about the Neo Fami and Famulator; they don't seem to exhibit the strange pitch increase evident in FOACs that have better imitation of the pulse channels. It seems you can't have everything. So some games sound decent (SMB) and some sound mediocre-to-hideous (Kirby) while on cheaper systems like what I'm just semi-affectionately calling 2 Famiclones I own-- the BS-Fami and the Soccer BS-Fami-- can come extremely close to accurate reproduction of pulse-heavy audio like in Kirby and yet they irredeemably destroy the audio of SMB by distorting the pitch of everything.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=2974">Epicenter</a> — Thu May 17, 2007 10:03 am</p><hr />

For example Zeroigar could've been pulled off on the SNES save for the full motion video (and who really wanted it anyway?) The music was lackluster compared to even a modest PCE title, the graphics layers were all woefully underutilized .. in a boss battle nothing moved except bullets and the background didn't even scroll-- it just plain STOPPED. Besides the hardware-utilization issue, the graphics were poor and the music/gameplay was uninspired at best.

Sega did a lot of stupid shit that ruined them, and their hardware was often like they just threw components at the wall to see what stuck, and sometimes they just got lucky (the minority of the time..) while Nintendo succeeded by being business-smart, building cheaper and more profitable hardware and locking in lots of developers (through often devious but effective practices) to ensure the most use came out of it. Prime example: SMS vs. NES: Which was the ultimately more powerful system? The SMS. Which one had 98+ of the fun software?

Bregalad's right: the SNES' SPC has the potential for unlimited awesomeness. However, the Genesis only sounds like bad old MIDIs on games where the musician didn't know how to use the YM2612; on games like <em>Zero Wing, Sonic The Hedgehog 3,</em> or <em>Street Fighter II,</em> where the game was either ported from arcade hardware with a similar chip or created specifically for the Genesis by someone who knew how to use an FM chip, it can be quite good, especially as Yamaha's FM chips provide a very clear, smooth sound.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=1013">commodorejohn</a> — Tue May 15, 2007 5:30 pm</p><hr />

If you wanted to use scaling+rotation with a tile map and tile data, you would eat up all KING RAM access slots, and only be able to display 1 KING background.  Also, using the higher-colored video modes reduced the number of backgrounds displayable(for each pixel drawn on the screen, the KING chip could only do 2 16-bit RAM fetches into internal buffers). <br /><br />You can display 32 VDC sprites per line, but only if you stagger them between the two VDCs, and only with 16-color sprites...if you want to use the 240-color mode for VDC backgrounds or sprites, you'll halve the VDC background or sprite capacity(in numbers and available memory).<br /><br />Also, the horizontal resolution was...lacking.  The KING backgrounds and motion decoder background can only be displayed at a horizontal resolution of 256, while the VDC layers can go slightly higher, to about 341 pixels wide.  However, if you put the VDC into the higher horizontal-resolution mode, layer alpha transparency is disabled.  Even when layer alpha transparency is enabled, it can only be applied when mixing the layers from different devices...<br /><br /><br />If games wanted to have decent music(the PSG in the PC-FX was functionally identical to the PCE, with 2 ADPCM channels tacked on), they could either use streaming ADPCM(which sounds ok, but has a rather high noise floor), or CD-DA(takes up a TON of disc space, though the CDROM drive in the PC-FX can vary the playback rate to some degree, which could reduce storage requirements, but I don't think any games did that).  I suppose it would have been possible to make a software mixer as well and stream that, but it may take too much CPU time, and the hardware doesn't make such a thing easy.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=1026">Mednafen</a> — Tue May 15, 2007 1:54 pm</p><hr />

The high resolution doesn't cost more CPU, PPU time or significant space on the SNES.<br />However, doing the same image in the highest resolution available would require 4 times more VRAM than it on low resolution, because this means 2 times more pixels vertically and horizontally.<br />Also, high resolution is only available vertically for sprites, if I remember correctly. Only 2 BG modes (5 and 6) allow high resolution horizontally, wich only allow few backgrounds layers with few colors/particular effects available.<br /><br />However, it's true that very few SNES games takes advantage of this, and this is a shame.<br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"><br />Opinions are opinions, but I can't stand inaccuracy.<br /></div><br />I agree, and the worst by far is game collectors spreading inacuracies and passing them as knownledgefull people because they have loads of stacked games.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"><br />Again that comes down to opinion but most SNES games sound like a low-grade PC MIDI to me, not anything glorious, and so I prefer the more creative application of the MD's PSG/YM2612.<br /></div><br />That really makes me laugh, because the Genesis sounds EXACTLY like very old MIDIs.
