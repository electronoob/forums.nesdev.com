If I'm not mistaken, Windows has used the same soundfont even before Windows XP, which I assume it sounded as relatively bad as it did so it could play off of any computer hardware from the period, and they haven't bothered to upgrade it, or what? I think MIDI gets a bad wrap because of it, even though MIDI files are relatively easy to make, very small, and have potentially really good quality.

In addition, GM is a bit tricky to get right because all the instruments have to work together in all possible situations, but I suppose that's hardly an excuse for a bad-sounding knockoff of a good-sounding GM synth...  I guess they just haven't really cared for a while, since nothing uses GM any more.<br /><br />Several years back, I slung together a sound bank and associated sound card settings specifically to sound good playing TIE Fighter music - I ran a couple instances of a simple reverb on the sound card's DSP so as to save CPU cycles for DOSBox, and routed the music through the reverb and the sound effects through a dry channel.  (That old computer has a nice sound card.)  I suppose one could do the TIE Fighter dynamic music thing with MP3 or OGG snippets, since a modern computer should have no trouble with overlapping playback, but to my knowledge nobody has...

Before general MIDI, there was no guarantee that was what you'd get. <br /><br />It really has nothing to do with sound. <br /><br />MIDI was invented to let synthesizers, controller units, sequencers and recording equipment communicate. Everything else is up to interpretation by the synth in question.

This is done through CC (control change) messages. With these you can program just about any parameter in your synth; including but not limited to patch parameters, internal fx (not just echo/reverb but any imaginable effect), and <span style="color: #800040">whole bank and RAM rewrites (for example including patches, samples, waveforms, depending on the synth</span>). <span style="font-size: 85%; line-height: normal">EDIT: oops, the stuff marked in red is not CC, but SysEx, which is designed do do just about anything... some synths would let you upload new firmware via SysEx messages, potentially working as a jailbreak. Naturally, SysEx is even more wild west.</span><br />. They have a sample rate and sample depth which sometimes (rarely) restricts you, but a competent synth can work around that.The crux is, CC:s are designed rather open ended so synths can use them for whatever the engineers want them to. While some synths and samplers may adhere to a loose standard, it's a bit of a wild west case. I'm not sure but i wouldn't be surprised if windows and most old midi to audio cards simply doesn't listen to the bulk of the CC range.

You can use microphones, or hardware or software synthesizers of any description, or samples recorded by someone else.  You can arrange things manually in an audio editor or a DAW software, or you can trigger and shape things with MIDI, or you can use proprietary automation and sequencing features in the software you're using.  Or you can use an old-school mixing desk and magnetic tape, and just digitize the master.  You can add hardware or software effects to individual components, or bunches of components, or the whole mix.  Or do the whole thing live through a stereo mic and don't even bother processing it.  It doesn't matter how you do it, as long as the result sounds the way you want it to.  If you really want to, you can just record the Windows synth playing a MIDI file and compress it as an MP3 - I'm not at all sure nobody has done this, and I do know for a fact that at least one version of TIE Fighter had some CD audio that was just the original MIDI soundtrack recorded through an AWE card.<br /><br />With MIDI, you can generally just record it with a keyboard, but sometimes it requires extra editing to get the performance you want (the advantage is that you <em>can</em> easily just tweak stuff, fix wrong notes, adjust timing, etc.).  Or perhaps one might use an instrument other than a keyboard to get the required data without an inordinate amount of messing around; for instance, MIDI guitars are a thing.  Software exists that allows you to notate music and have the computer play it via MIDI, or export a MIDI file.  Basically the problem with using MIDI for distribution is that it's limited to the real-time synthesis capability of the target platform, which is often uninspiring...<br /><br />...<br /><br />I was really into computer-generated music a while back (actually I kinda still am, but I'm too busy most of the time).  Not being a composer, I tended to take other people's MIDI files as my starting point.  For example, I found <a href="http://www.ualberta.ca/~gsupeene/tragic.mid" class="postlink">this</a> (NB: playing this file can change the media player's output level in the Windows mixer, so other stuff plays super quiet for no good reason) on the net and liked it, so I used a bunch of samples and effects and custom programming to turn it into <a href="http://www.ualberta.ca/~gsupeene/93143_-_The_Tragic_Prince.mp3" class="postlink">this</a> (some bits are inspired by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHpMdgM0Sb4" class="postlink">the original</a>).  I'd say it turned out pretty well considering it was my first, and so far only, serious attempt at metal; there are a few things I'd change but I overwrote the Cubase file...<br /><br />In 2005 I recorded a piano sample set from an old, unmaintained upright in the basement I was renting with my sister.  The sample preparation took forever and the programming is still not done, but I have a working prototype that's sort of playable.  I've tested it by running MIDI scans of old piano rolls through it.  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykfQjV7-6c" class="postlink">This</a> is what Punchinello sounds like on a real player piano.  <a href="http://www.ualberta.ca/~gsupeene/NU_punchidemo.mp3" class="postlink">This</a> is what it sounds like on the alpha prototype of the Nearly Upright.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />My favourite was the Windows 95 OPL3 general midi sound, back before they had the GS Wavetable (Was that introduced in Windows 98?). I used to write lots of MIDI for it and I liked some of the sounds it made a lot. Later on I learned how to program the sound card directly though and that's when I found out all about FM synthesis.<br /><br />Before the GS Wavetable there were actually all sorts of competing software wavetable MIDI players available. They all had their own patch set, and you can imagine how different the same file sounded in various players.<br /><br /><br />The question of why the GS Wavetable isn't as good as some other solutions:<br /><br />I think problem 1 is that it had to be a lightweight and small implementation, to keep the CPU usage low and suitable for background play while doing oher things; this limits a lot of potential techniques (e.g. you can get better results from layered mutlitimbral sounds than just samples, but it takes more computation).<br /><br />Problem 2, as stated in several different ways above, is that every General MIDI sound set sounds different. If a MIDI is composed for one synthesizer, it will generally sound poorly on every other one. There's no guarantee of balance between instruments, no guarantee of specific timbres, just a vague set of names like &quot;guitar&quot; or &quot;piano&quot; or &quot;gunshot&quot;. You can't just play a MIDI on device A and device B to compare the quality of the device.<br /><br />FWIW I think a lot of people have composed good music intended for the GS Wavetable (my go-to example is usually <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zyyn5rvmJ9I" class="postlink">3D Space Cadet Pinball</a>). If it was composed <em>for</em> this device it has a lot of potential to sound good on it. (Here's a <a href="http://bandcamp.mynameiser.in/album/the-space-adventures-of-general-mibi" class="postlink">recent GS Wavetable album</a> by Svetlana.)<br /><br /><br />MIDIs you find on the internet come from many different eras, and I think <em>most</em> of them come from long before the time when GS Wavetable became common. MP3 was already taking over before Windows 98 happened. MIDIs are from an earlier time when a super-compact representation was more important.<br /><br />All that said, there are even ways to write MIDI files that sound fairly robust across different players, but there's a real art to that. Open orchestration, relying on counterpoint vs blend (e.g. Bach tends to work fine on anything you play it with), etc. this was a big concern for me around ~1997 when I was making and sharing a lot of MIDI files myself. I was constantly trying different playback methods to compare, because I knew it was likely people weren't playing back my stuff on the same thing I wrote it with.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />The windows softsynth just implements the very basic things needed to make sound at all. 22KHz, basic freq scaling (no sophisticated interpolation methods) and volume, no filters, no reverb or chorus or any other effect, it had to run on stuff like 486 CPUs and still do at least 24 channels. I think the playback code never changed in any meaningful way since it was introduced in Win98 with WDM drivers. <br />You could possibly experiment with replacing GM.DLS with your own sound font to change how the default softsynth sounds like, but you won't still get any of the effects like reverb.

A midi generator + filter controlled by game cues could modify scores as they are played on the go, manage mixing, acoustics, sfx. We're not just there yet, i suppose. Or well, we could be, but not with the cinematic soundrack/AAA expectancies.
