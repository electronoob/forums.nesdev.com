The emulator hid the fact that you had a corrupt dump, and then when you made an innocent patch it decided to stop covering for it being corrupt.</div><br /><br />Nestopia has a window within the image info patched or not. I do something similar with my emulator, so it's <strong>not</strong> being hidden in anyways. However, AFAIK, it's not possible to identify a good dump, except with CRCs but... may get in trouble as blargg pointed out. So, for dirty headers yes, it's fixable.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />As far as SHA-1 collisions go, you have to see things in a risk-neutral manner.  What's the probability, across all NES roms, of a collision?  A quick look on wikipedia suggests that it's significantly smaller than 10^(-18).  Such things aren't worthy of mention; might as well talk about why we aren't defending our emulators against lightning strikes or wild zebra attacks.  Just talking about it here has already given the question of coincidental SHA1 collisions more time than it ever deserves.  (Intentional collisions is a different matter, but not one of interest).

By all means implement it so that the newer ROMs can take advantage but just remember that 99% of games that are used (Super Mario Bros., Zelda, Metroid etc.) are still in iNES 1.0 and always will be.<br /><br />So even though Headers are best emulators are still forced to use CRC/Choosing a board on load to determine how ~99% or so of ROMs are setup.

It's already extremely unlikely to happen ever. This really is a non-issue.<br /><br /><br />That said, I'm completely in favour of iNES 2 support. The more important problem having to do with CRC checks is you can't romhack a game that relies on the CRC check to be run correctly. (This is a really annoying thing about MAME.)

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I just thought of a way to integrate hash checking and NES 2.0 into the same framework. For each ROM, someone would find a distinctive part of the PRG ROM that translation hacks are unlikely to change, such as level decoding code. This part would be expressed as a start address and length, with the expected hash value. Each hash match would be mapped to an NES 2.0 header. Separating the database into a self-contained filter that just corrects loaded ROMs in this way would keep the emulator core itself clean, taking whatever NES 2.0 file the front-end gives it.<br /><br />Each database entry would need 36 bytes:<br /><ul><li>Offset from start of PRG ROM of hashed area (4 bytes) </li><li>Length of hashed area (2 bytes) </li><li>SHA-1 value (20 bytes) </li><li>Bytes 6 through 15 of the correct NES 2.0 header (10 bytes) </li></ul><br />So what other homebrew ROMs have correct NES 2.0 headers?

Only a small fraction of video games are homebrew. In fact, commercial NES games outnumber homebrew NES games to such an extent that Red Hat's legal department won't let Red Hat include a freely licensed NES emulator in the Fedora repository.
