<br />Why would you want this for dev at all?
<br />Compiling, hooking up a CF card reader, copying it over, putting it in, and booting it, oh shit typo, start all over.
<br />
<br />vs.
<br />
<br />Compiling it, USB upload to QuickDev16 already plugged in, oh shit typo, just reset and resend the changed portion

While it certainly is nice if you can just quickly change, rebuild, and upload to test again with real hardware nowdays there are extremely accurate NES and SNES emulators available so you don't need to do real hardware tests that often that loading the file on a CF card will be such a problem. I have a GDSF7 which would allow uploading ROMs but it's still limited by parallel transfer speeds and more importantly the parallel port itself which my current PC lacks entirely. The QuickDev16 seems nice but face it, if I can get one device that lets me test and play homebrew as well as play all my other games I'll go for that and take the added hassle for quick cycle time testing.

<br />And yes, I would use it for dev, that would be my first reason for buying it. I'm no saint either so I'm sure I would try a game or two but this would not be my main reason of buying that device.  
<br />
<br />It just felt that people got more excited about the fact of playing their games on it than the dev aspect on the dev forum. This was my point I was trying to put emphasis on: where in the dev forum, not the general one.

<br />
<br />I don't use my PowerPak for playing that often, I basically do that when friends want to play something I don't have in cart format, so I quickly put it in the PP. I have a few games in it, but I can't seem to play any of them longer than 10 minutes. Then again, I don't play my regular carts that much either, I guess I do most of my playing on emulators. I'm a sucky player, so I kinda rely on save states too much I guess.

<br />The problem is that I wanted to have already a couple of NES games out by now when I start SNES-dev, but making a full game is hard.

Of course that could change quickly but prototyping boards is expensive!  The Pico stuff is all configurable in the FPGA.  Anyone who wants a bigger FPGA can swap it themselves  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">Hojo_Norem wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">Also, what version of the DPS1 is best to install for best compatibility?</div>
<br />From what I have seen, nobody knows.  Only seen brief mentions of bug fixes in the 1A/1B without details.  Hopefully someone will use this product to check out any differences.

<br />I don't have any desire to do any SNES dev'ing. If I do eventually get this PP it would be for gaming only. For dev'ing I'm much more interested in the 2600 and the SMS... I guess I like to work with 8-bit systems better.

While I enjoy gaming on the 8bit NES, I can't really see myself developing much of anything for it when SNES seems like a much better option. Ofcourse that's because I think it's an easier system to work with than NES or atleast easier because of extra capability.
