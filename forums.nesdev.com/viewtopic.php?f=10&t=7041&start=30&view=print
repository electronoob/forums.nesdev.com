<br />I wouldn't say that. It really depends on the emulator, but even the most accurate ones are likely to not behave exactly like the real console under extreme circumstances (like PPU operations at weird times during rendering). Some popular emulators (such as FCEU and its derivatives) don't even emulate the internal working of the PPU properly (things such as sprite evaluation and pattern fetches don't work like on hardware).
<br />
<br />I think that the chances of breaking a ROM while hacking it are very high, because hackers never know if they are messing with sensitive code, since they weren't the ones that programmed the game.
<br />
<br />I agree that the short answer is: You'll only know when you test on hardware. And even with the PowerPak you can't be 100% sure depending on the mapper, because not all PowerPak mappers behave exactly like the original ones.

<br />Now i'm having other problems because i would like to make some mapper 1 cart with battery support.
<br />questions:
<br /> 
<br />1)the manual says i need a diode. omg omg omg. what kind of diode should i buy?
<br />
<br />2)This is where i have to put the battery (where the white circle is):
<br /><img src="http://img707.imageshack.us/img707/2770/pict4263o.jpg" alt="Image" />
<br />but how? :O 
<br />
<br />3)i have some battery holder that look like these:

<br />But anyway, for the diode. I have no idea. The battery case should be the first one thin enough to fit. Unless by some miracle someone has a link to NEW ones with TABS. (I NEED some, if you do please post!)
<br />
<br />
<br />Now just get into some assembly and your making new games.  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_lol.gif" alt=":lol:" title="Laughing" />  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt=":roll:" title="Rolling Eyes" />

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I'm surprised the manual doesn't specify the part number for the diode. A standard small-signal silicon diode should do, like the 1N914 or 1N4148. I've used one of those in an MMC1 cart and they work fine. I've seen some suggestions to use a Schottky diode, as it has a lower voltage drop (0.3V versus 0.6V), but apparently also a higher leakage current. Avoid germanium diodes. I know you might not be familiar with all this, but I offer the information because you can't learn if you aren't exposed to things to learn. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />

<br />
<br />
<br />Does it say where to get the socket from? And maybe be a little more clear with your question? And a full PCB shot might help, as maybe the right solder hole isn't there. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" />

<br />From those pics, it doesn't look like 2 of those big square pads are connected to anything, but I guess they must be connected to the copper filled area around it, which surely must be ground.

<br />
<br />I agree, surface mount battery holder, which I haven't ever seen ever, but they're probably out there. And according to <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://benheck.com/Downloads/NES_Famicom_Pinouts.pdf">http://benheck.com/Downloads/NES_Famicom_Pinouts.pdf</a><!-- m --> the leftmost pin  from the top (36) is +5 and pin 1 is ground. While on the bottom, leftmost pin (37) is CLK (Not used on the NROM-256 board I am looking at) and the rightmost pin (71) is also ground. So somewhere on that board, one of those pins on the battery holder goes to the SRAM somehow. 0_o
<br />
<br />
<br />It also looks that since there is no "Battery back SRAM" jumper that the battery is automatically hooked to the voltage pin of the SRAM somehow. Through the board trace?
