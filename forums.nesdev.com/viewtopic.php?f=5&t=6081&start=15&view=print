<br />His emu+ide, nesicide, will compile (usually) on Linux.  It supports symbolic debugging and directly uses the ".nes.dbg" output files from ld65.  It works on windows and Ubuntu.  Mattmatteh and I (well, mostly mattmatteh) are ensuring that it works on Gentoo Linux (my platform of choice).
<br />
<br />nesicide supports a huge number of powerful debugger breakpoints.  You can rig a break-point when the PPU is rendering a given pixel, for example.

<br />No you don't! <img src="./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" />  If windows is working fine for you and does the job, you don't really need linux.  If your windows box doesn't work anymore and have all kind of issues and linux fix it then go for it. If not, you may just be wasting your time. Or just install it on another partition and use it once in a while until you get used to it.
<br />
<br />I think there is no perfect os anymore: just use the one that you like and don't care about the rest. The rest is just people religious war about which one is better.  Just go on a site like apple insider to see how biased some people can be! (...)
<br />
<br />Basically, if it's not broken, don't fix it. 
<br />

<br />Dwedit: Windows does have <a href="http://dokan-dev.net/en/about/" class="postlink">Dokan</a>, which looks like the same thing as FUSE. Do you complain that not enough FUSE file systems are <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/dokan/web/filesystems-using-dokan" class="postlink">ported to Dokan</a>? Or is it the amd64 code signing requirement again?

<br />
<br />The only VERY important rule is that you need to always install windows first and linux last. If you install Windows on a PC which already have a linux session, Windows might (and probably will) ignore it and install it's own booting partition, and not even have a menu that allows you to choose to boot on an other partition (this is really bad microsoft, but what can I do about it ?).
<br />
<br />Also the second rule of thumb is that whenever you'll have to re-install of of the systems (windows OR linux) be sure to backup ALL your important data safely before doing so. According to what I said on point 1, a windows re-installation will imply at least a partial linux re-installation. A linux re-instaltion could damage something in your data as well.
<br />
<br />Third rule of thumb it's a very good idea to keep all your important data on a third partition which does not contain either of the OSes. This partition should be formatted FAT32 (or maybe NTSF) but not the linux formatting else you won't be able to acess your important data from Windows.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />For me I got fed up with XP just a few days ago when I attempted to help a family member with their virus infected XP laptop. I was going to just reinstall XP for them and they said hey why don't you check out such and such a technical support website so we can try to get rid of the virus first? So I went to the suggested site, and got the same virus. Her laptop was already so far gone that you couldn't even see any files in C:\ in safe mode. When I realized mine started deleting files and going haywire, I was able to get into safe mode before it was too late, and back up my files.  I hate feeling like windows is this gigantic piece of swiss cheese for viruses. So, I'm on linux now.  I may eventually cave and go back to windows in order to finish my game, as there are several things for NES development that seem to work so much better on windows (debugging, famitracker)...but, I'm going to give this a chance, see how far I get before I go insane  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" />

<br />Wouldn't call this a rule. As long as your Linux system is running properly and you know what you're doing, you can install Windows last. The trick includes hiding the Linux partitions and reserving free space for Windows.
<br />Later you will have to manually edit your bootloader config(In most cases that would be GRUB) as well to actually be able to boot Windows.
<br />It's tedious, but one thing I learned since I use Linux is, that nothing is impossible. There are just the easy ways and the harder ones.
<br />
<br />But I agree about the backup stuff ;3
<br />
<br />
<br />About getting the sound right with emulators and/or FamiTracker in wine.
<br />I had that problem and I tried many different things to get around it.
<br />The closest thing to a solution was to use a low-latency patch on my kernel.
<br />It works.
<br />But that's it...
<br />It doesn't sound nice and I still sometimes have some problems with sound that don't make sense to me...
<br />
<br />Abput Virtualbox for emulation:
<br />I have actually never tried that, cause I'm usually to lazy to boot up a Virtual machine <img src="./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" />
<br />Sounds possible to me, but I doubt that you'll have better results than with wine.
<br />
<br />Ubuntu was always my favourite choice. It is true though that it installs quite a bit of useless stuff and it is hard to get rid of it all, but still it is a nice system.

<br />
<br />I'm sure people would said "yeah but that wouldn't stop a malicious software to delete files that are not set with administrator rights thought", yes, but the same thing can be done on linux or any OS too.
<br />
<br />But anyway.  I don't want to say that windows XP is better, it's getting old after all. I just want to re-iterate that all OS have security issues to some degree and depending how you use it, it will make you life harder. So if, for example, use a not really patched XP box in administrator mode with no firewall and using IE6: you're looking for trouble. Same thing for linux in the same condition (it may take longer but it could happen).
<br />
<br />In the end, it's all in the way you use it. But I don't like OS "wars" anymore so use any OS you like.  I got some virus in the past too on MS OS and it's not because I got them myself, it just other people told me that their external drive "were safe" (...). In normal usage, very rarely.
