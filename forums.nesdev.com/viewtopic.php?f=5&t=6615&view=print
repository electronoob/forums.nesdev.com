		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />In Japan, there is this old educational kids book called: "The Stars of Famicom Games: Game Software Production and Distribution". In it, they go on a tour of Nintendo and explain how games are made.
<br />
<br />In this book, there are development pictures of Super Mario Bros. 3, dated from July 1989.
<br />
<br />Look at scans and a translation of the book here:

<br />
<br />Some of the more interesting pictures:
<br />
<br /><img src="http://www.disgruntleddesigner.com/chrisc/secret/weekly/FamiStars10.jpg" alt="Image" />
<br />(Tezuka doing graphics work. A close-up of this picture reveals "Graphics editing was performed on a Fujitsu FM R-50 HD (modest spec.) business computer.")
<br />
<br /><img src="http://www.disgruntleddesigner.com/chrisc/secret/weekly/FamiStars10a.jpg" alt="Image" />
<br />(A close-up of the above picture. Part of the chr-rom. You can see the NES palette and the sprite palettes.)
<br />
<br /><img src="http://www.disgruntleddesigner.com/chrisc/secret/weekly/FamiStars19.jpg" alt="Image" />
<br />(Nakago and someone else programming the game. The writer of the article can't recognize thise computers, nor can I. Anybody know?)
<br />
<br />
<br />There are many other interesting pictures ther too, including prototypes, manufacturing process, and even Tezuka's Mega Drive collection (lol). Note that the site has a lot of close-ups of interesting portions.
<br />
<br />
<br />If you know anything about Nintendo, perhaps from reading the excellent Iwata Asks articles, where the President of Nintendo very candidly interviews those who've made games (History of Mario and Zelda and Game and Watch ones were especially good), you may recognize some of the people here. They're all a lot younger looking.
<br />
<br />
<br />I have to close by saying that I don't post here a lot, but I love reading the site, so pardon my intrusion.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />My first guess on those computers in the lower picture is that they're HP 64000 series computers (technically mainframes). They were widely used for processor emulation and logic analysis, and are still popular with people who develop embedded systems today. I happen to have the "portable" model, the HP 64110A. It weighs about 60 pounds.
<br />
<br />EDIT: You may also notice that the 64000's have the optional PROM/EPROM programming device which mounts into the keyboard area on the right side. Very convenient!
<br />
<br />EDIT2: Looked closer at the page. These are absolutely positively 64000 series computers. The keyboard is the exact same, but the HP branding has been wiped off! By the way, these units were typically slaved together with a large HP "minicomputer" to access network file storage, which explains the arrangement they have there. Usually only one of these would be fully equipped with probes etc. for hardware analysis, so you'd make a script, run your tests, and then fetch the data back to one of these less-equipped machines so you wouldn't tie up the hardware so long.
