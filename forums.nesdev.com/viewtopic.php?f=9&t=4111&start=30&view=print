		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Well, I desoldered the two sockets, then cleaned the remaining solder in both sides, then cleaned the pcb with isoprophilic alcohol, soldered the sockets again, soldered the cables to rewire A18, A17, A16, etc, and then tried it again.
<br />Now the game worked but it showed messed graphics. Then I opened the cart again, and I discovered a short circuit between A18 and A16 in the CHR socket. Fixed that and now its working perfectly. Time to burn some games baby n_______n.
<br />Thank you very much to all of you for your support. I'd never manage to do it without your invaluable help.

<br />I think I didn't explain it well. Lets see, had you seen those holes where the track its in the front side and in the back there's not any track?. Well, in the SMB3 TSROM PCB, there's lots of holes like that. I was soldering only in the back side, and the tracks in the front in these holes where not connected to the socket pins. Not to mention my big error when I soldered the cables to rewire some of its pins: I was committing the same mistake, soldering the cable in the back side of the pcb only, so these cables were useless, because the track was in the front side.
<br />Anyway, now I have a TSROM devcart, and there's lots of games that use that board. For example Kunio Kun no Nekketsu Soccer League. The american remake Nintendo World Cup, is a piece of shit compared to the original. I tried first with SMB3 and it worked, so I tried with KKNNSL and it worked too. I'm very happy with this new toy, and all this thanks to the help of all of you and this great website.
<br />Thanks a lot to everyone for your help.
<br />C U n.n
