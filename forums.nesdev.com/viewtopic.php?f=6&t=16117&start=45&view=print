Or is there some way to trigger a speech sound on the title screen? The sound test mode doesn't appear to have any PCM samples, though it has several DPCM ones.<br /><br />Blades of Steel uses PCM for other stuff too like &quot;face off&quot;. Kinda depends on whether it's a sound that can interrupt gameplay or not. (Kind of unusual as a game that uses both!)

It's writing $4011 roughly every 86 cycles for the duration of that sound.</div><br /><br />Listen, I don't need to argue about this, but...<br />I know it's DPCM (the encoding) because I could convert it properly to WAV with Tepples's tool to do so (18.exe), and it sounds perfect. I have an attached WAV file (had to rename the extension) that I have converted from the ROM with the code/data logger. The sample also clearly sounds like DPCM to me in-game. Plus, Konami ALWAYS seems to use DPCM for their sampled audio.<br />It does seem weird that it's writing $4011 so many times, though. Maybe it's playing the DPCM and converting it to raw PCM? That doesn't really make sense, but I don't really know for sure. Maybe someone could take a look at this?

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Ah, well that's interesting then. This means that the sample is stored in ROM in the 1-bit DPCM format, but it's played back with a software decoder that converts it to PCM first. That's pretty bizarre? It's not that unusual for the PCM to be <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/viewtopic.php?t=8675" class="postlink">decompressed from another format</a>, but from a format the hardware already natively supports??<br /><br />It's definitely not using the DPCM <em>hardware</em> to play it back but apparently yes the sample itself is encoded in the 1-bit DPCM format.<br /><br />The music tracks use hardware DPCM constantly.
