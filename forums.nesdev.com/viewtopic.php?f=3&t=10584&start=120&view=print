My current version (the one with MMC1 support) is cycle accurate but has no sprite implementation yet. Drawing backgrounds seems to be just fine with games like Mega Man 2, Final Fantasy and Zelda. The issue is that some games tend to draw random tiles of black rather than the actual color, i.e. the guy with the white tanktop in the Contra start screen, the entire upper half of the start screen in Zelda II and several screens which are heavy on big background characters in Skate or Die. I think that's a problem with my drawing methods in the PPU though, so it should not be too much of a hassle to fix. I guess I'll quickly implement sprites and then I'll see how far I can get.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">Blargg wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">By the way, those CPU tests will even catch you doing something incorrect like x++ or s|=0x08(SED) in your LSR.

I think this is right, since if paletteIndex % 4 == 0, meaning that it's one of the memory values 0x04, 0x08 and 0x0C, it will automatically fetch the background color at 0x3F00.

That's why my previous version with only 8x8 sprite implementation draws the shirts partially, while my cycle-accurate BG only PPU draws jack diddly-squat.

Also, that mask thing looks good; I'll use it instead of the if-else statement.

With later machines, the cost of a cache miss started being huge enough, even with speculative fetch, such that using tables are better for things that never used to be true (at least as long as CS:IP/EIP/RIP is still in-order).

It is very handy.  For example I just realized I'm failing one of the sprite overflow tests now   <img src="./images/smilies/icon_question.gif" alt=":?:" title="Question" />.  Coupled with git bisect, a test automation can shave *minutes* off of bug chasing.   <img src="./images/smilies/icon_lol.gif" alt=":lol:" title="Laughing" />

Of course you need a beefy multicore PC and an efficient emulator if you want to run 200 test ROMs in a reasonable time.
