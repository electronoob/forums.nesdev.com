Bandai was fond enough of the idea to try something similar with the Datach Joint ROM system and again with the Sufami Turbo for the SNES.  <br /><br />Speaking of add-ons, Nantettatte!! Baseball is a cartridge which can accept a pair of update add-on cartridges.  The main game's mapper is 68, so I assume that the expansion ROMs are also 68, but Nestopia assigns them to mapper 4 (and they don't work).  I would also note that Nestopia disagrees with some of the mapper assignments for the Namco and Bandai games, but it may be a bit behind the times. <br /><br />Finally, about those speech chips.  They can be found in cartridges using Mapper 3, 18, 72, 86, 92.  The cartridges using 86 and 92 always have speech chips but the cartridges using 3, 18 and 72 may or may not have speech chips, and one cartridge uses a chip that is slightly different.  Only one mapper 3 game has speech chips.  Should a setting in NES 2.0 be added to distinguish those games in case the speech chips ever get dumped and emulated?

It seems kludgey, but it's one way of doing it. It has its own database of metadata anyway, so didn't need to rely on the iNES 2 dream to do it.<br /><br />Probably iNES 2 could use some kind of &quot;extra data blobs&quot; extension to support something like this, but the dumps haven't been done, so... is there a need to worry about it yet?
