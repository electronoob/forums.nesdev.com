		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Following a conversion on the <a href="https://wiki.nesdev.com/w/index.php/Talk:VRC6" class="postlink">wiki talk page</a>, I have transcribed and translated the Japanese VRC6 data sheet, hopefully without introducing critical errors. I had understood modes 0 to 2 well enough, but was confused about mirroring in mode 3, and the point of clearing the Mode Register's bit 5.<br /><br />The data sheet made it reasonably clear to me that Mode Register bit 5 being cleared is supposed to be used with 512 KiB (4 kilobit) of CHR-ROM, and that the CHR-ROM must be connected differently. The data sheet does not specify how exactly, but connecting VRC6's A10-A17 to CHR-ROM's A11-A18 and PPU's A10 to CHR-ROM's A10 seems to be the only plausible way, and then the behavior of Mode 1 with bit 5 cleared makes perfect sense: use the same eight bank data bits unchanged for the upper and lower 1 KiB part of the 2 KiB CHR bank as CHR A11-A18, and use PPU A10 as CHR A10, yielding 256 2 KiB banks for a total of 512 KiB.<br /><br />I still have not the slightest clue about how Mode 3's mirroring really works, and more importantly: what is the point of that complicated nonsense? What application does it have? The data sheet does not provide an explanation, only four examples that are not helpful at all.<br /><br />Attached Nintendulator source file is written to succeed at <a href="https://www.mediafire.com/file/6hvuj53omv8y3fn/vrc6test.zip" class="postlink">Natt's test ROMs</a>. But those (to my knowledge, correct me if I'm wrong) have never been tried on real hardware, and my combinatorial logic of the mirroring behavior in the source file is just me trying to turn the <a href="https://wiki.nesdev.com/w/index.php/VRC6#Mirroring" class="postlink">lookup tables from the wiki</a> into something that can be expressed without tables. Also, I tried to implement how I think the 512 KiB CHR-ROM mode works without having any opportunity to test it.<br /><br />(@rainwarrior: I spotted and corrected some mistakes compared to the previous version of the transcript.)<br /><br />Edit: v0.2, correcting a typo in a number.

I could see the argument that the Nametable bank and Mirroring tables should be somehow combined)

What does mode 0 + ROM nametables do? (Not officially documented.) I would guess that CHR A10 is exactly the same as when using CIRAM, but the upper 7 bits of the registers still apply as per the nametable register table?<br /><br />2. What happens with bit 5 clear? (Again undocumented.) I think the answer to this is probably on the table here somewhere, but I'm still trying to piece it together. It sounds like the nametable register LSB always goes to CHR A10, but how do I describe the effect of this... Though I suppose it being an undocumented and unsupported mode, not intended for this kind of wiring anyway, maybe just a 16 column table would be fine.

With 12 slots and eight registers, that means that the same number appears several times. For modes $02/$03 that's not <em>too</em> bad—CR0 CR1 CR2 CR3 CR4 CR4 CR5 CR5 CR6 CR7 CR6 CR7—but still silly in comparison to using mode $22. For mode $04 it's equally useful—CR0 CR1 CR2 CR3 CR4 CR5 CR6 CR7 CR6 CR7 CR6 CR7—there's still two slots that hold a uselessly duplicated value, but now the duplicated values are also being displayed as a nametable.

I hope it's not too much information, but it's at least all in tables and hierarchically organized. Conveniently the &quot;important&quot; mode is mode 0 anyway, which comes first and has the shortest description.
