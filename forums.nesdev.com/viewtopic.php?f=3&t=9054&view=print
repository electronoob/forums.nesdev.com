		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />[edit] After running Nestest and comparing it to my emulator's output (I had to write a small program, since they're so extensive), I could figure out wrong behaviors, and now Super Mario Bros runs flawlessy! Thank you guys for your patience! <img src="./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" />
<br />
<br />I am writing a (kinda) didactic NES emulator. I've already finished the CPU and most of the PPU, but I am in doubt over some things. I am trying to run Super Mario Bros, which I know is difficult, but I can already play the whole game (and even hear basic sounds and music!). I wish to know:
<br />
<br />1. How does it fill up the palettes? It seems to be writing to the $3300-$331F PPU area, but I thought that address mirrored down to $2300-$231F (and ended up changing on-screen tiles). Making it mirror to $3F00-$3F1F works, but I'm not sure if that's correct.
<br />
<br />2. How does the nametable select (lowest bits written to port $2000) work? Does it affect writing to/reading from nametables, or does it just affects how PPU renders things? I get to see question blocks from the next screen on the title screen.
<br />
<br />I tested my emulator with tutorial games (like ones that teach scrolling), and they worked perfectly, including palettes, so I don't know what's wrong. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" />  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" />  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" />

<br />
<br />Thanks, but I've already implemented the V, T and X registers. The scroll works fine, it's just that blocks from other screens get drawn on the current one. It seems that lots of PPU addresses used by Super Mario Bros are getting screwed up.

<br />
<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">AA<br />BB<br /></div><br /><br />or<br /><br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">AB<br />AB<br /></div>
<br />
<br />unless they have 2KB VRAM on cart, or some other weird mirroring. If you mirror wrong they will seem like they're all going to the first nametable. Use NESTOPIA and change a SMB ROM to the other mirroring and play it and see if it's the same as your problem, if so, you know what it is.

<br />SMB uses vertical mirroring, meaning that the two name tables are arranged side by side, so when it renders the first screen it has a full screen to the right of it that it can preload with blocks that will show up when the screen scrolls.
<br />
<br />If you use the wrong mirroring and arrange the two name tables vertically, the one to the right of the first screen will be a mirror of the first one, so things that aren't supposed to be displayed yet will overwrite tiles in the first screen.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Thanks, I found the problem (it was something else! The PPU register V was still being copied from register T even when sprites and background were off). Now it scrolls and draws the background correctly... But there's still something wrong. Attribute tables seem off (just blocks on even rows and columns get colored right - maybe it's just my fault on the render section), and when Mario destroys a block, it updates the tile on the top of the screen, rather than on the block's position.
<br />
<br />Does Super Mario Bros. uses the V register while drawing the screen (i.e. non-V-blank) to update tiles?
<br />
<br />Also, firebars aren't drawing correctly (they're just ONE fireball in the middle of blocks). Is there something special to them, or is it just me that haven't implemented full emulation?

<br />I tried NEStress, and it passed the tests. I'm going to try nestest, then.
<br />
<br />[edit] OK, so something is really wrong <img src="./images/smilies/icon_lol.gif" alt=":lol:" title="Laughing" />, because it doesn't even show the little asterisk cursor! I get to see all the text, though. But I can't move nor run any tests. What should I do? Commercial games are working, what does Nestest do differently?

For example, if you aren't setting the N flag properly on LDY, lots of games will probably run just fine -- until you try to run a game that actually reads the N flag after an LDY.
<br />
<br />Maybe Balloon Fight / Excitebike just don't rely on whatever behavior is broken, so they are unaffected by it.

I checked the beginning and then a few random spots to check whether they matched, and they did. Could there still be little bugs? I could create something to automatically read both logs and tell me what's different, since it's so long. Is that necessary?
<br />
<br />So maybe I'm screweing up the PPU ports? It's strange, because the level gets drawn correctly, it's just the attributes and blocks updating that go wrong.
