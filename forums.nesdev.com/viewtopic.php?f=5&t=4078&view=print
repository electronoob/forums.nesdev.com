<br />
<br />- Hoax? Not really, just incomplete, but everything is there, even a playable PC demo as I said. Well, at least, there's the FULL soundtrack for download. The SuperNES music played in the 2A03 hardware. Look at <em>Rockman Perfect Memories</em> site.

<br />Except have more than one player control a character. If shared-screen multiplayer on a PC is so easy, then why can't the major PC game developers figure it out? Why can't PC games other than Lego Star Wars and Serious Sam read more than one gamepad connected to a single PC?

<br />Ah, good old tepples, always looking for exceptions... =)
<br />
<br />In my defense, I said it was uninteresting <strong>for me</strong>, from a developer point of view. As in "I don't consider it an interesting programming project". For most players it won't matter.

<br />
<br />The site is in chinese, so even if my computer somehow manage to show chinese characters (I don't know how he got them) I can't make any sense of it, so I couldn't download any demo nor soundtrack.
<br />
<br />But yeah, I've donloaded a lot of NSFs that reproduce the music of more recent games (sometimes using other chips like FDS or Namco), and it's quite interesting. Even if most of the people who did it did it for fun and not to actually use it in a NES game, I still find it insteresting and fun.
<br />
<br />EDIT : Oh yeah I was able to do more browsing on the site depsite the chinese. And yeah there is kinda interesting stuff, and music, and big sprites remade for inferior NES hardware. This looks much more serious than the FFX hoax.

<br />Are you getting squares in place of the characters? If you're using XP, you can pick "Regional and Language Options" from the control panel, go to the "Languages" tab and select "Instal files for East Asian languages". You'll need your Windows CD. When it's done you'll be able to read (uh, I mean... "see") japanese, chinese, korean, and god knows what else.
<br />
<br />After you installed the files, you can also include japanese as an input language in your computer, so you can directly write katakana, hiragana and kanji. I don't know if it's as easy with the other languages.

<br />Of course, but they as long as they don't claim it to be a NES port but a NES-like port, then I see no problem of it to be for PC. I remember playing a small NES-like Mega Man minigame for the PC, and it was fun.

Chinese only uses the complex ones. The reason why (most) NES games have only the simple characters (hiragana and/or katakana) is because there is only a small portion of them when compared to the complex ones (kanji). Since everything that can be written in kanji can be written with the smaller alphabets, there is no need to waste a shitload of tiles in kanji. Most games even use hiragana or katakana, not both, just to save more tiles.<br /><br />IIRC, all chinese games that make heavy use of text must use CHR-RAM, because there is no way to have all the symbols loaded at a time, so they have to be copied from ROM as necessary.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">I remember playing a small NES-like Mega Man minigame for the PC, and it was fun.</div>
<br />Fun? Maybe. Interesting programming achievement? Probably not. Now, if this game was programmed, say, in JavaScript to be run inside a browser window, then it'd be an interesting achievement. I've never seen an interesting platformer (well) made like that.

<br />
<br />A NES-like game is not as impressive as a NES game, because PCs nowadays run at like the GHz level, and you could probably do several frames worth of calculations in the time it'd take the NES to do just one.
