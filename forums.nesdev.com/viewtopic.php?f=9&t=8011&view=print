		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I wasn't sure about posting that in the NES section but I figured my question is still NES related and people here would most likely be able to answer. I have recently acquired a very peculiar Korean Super Famicom pirate multicart that include 20 NES game like Super Mario Bros. (Gravel floor version if you guy know what I'm referring to), Antarctic Adventure, Twin Bee etc... Typical multicart game to be found on a famicom multicart but it's very surprising to see them on a Super Famicom cart. Not only that, but the weirdest thing is that the music and sound effect of the NES game were replaced for something that seem to use the higher quality sound hardware of the SNES (higher quality hardware does not mean higher quality music and effects <img src="./images/smilies/icon_lol.gif" alt=":lol:" title="Laughing" /> )
<br />
<br />What do you guy think of that? Are mapper 0 nes game compatible with SNES CPU? I seem to remember about 10 years ago seeing a few NES rom converted into SNES file that were running without sound on my old SWC DX2 but the new game soundtrack on that bootleg cart got me really confused. Maybe it doesn't sound as crazy to you as it sound to me but I still figured it was worth questioning.
<br />
<br />I tried to dump the cart but my tototek reader only detect 2Mbits LoROM cart and the resulting dump boot up as Antarctic Adventure without sound and crashing when you start a game.
<br />
<br />Here's a quick video, please forgive the out of synch audio(it is not like that when playing and it is not a poorly made montage <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /> ), it is recorded on very crappy USB capture hardware and is meant as a quick demo of what I am talking about&#058;

<br />
<br />The SNES CPU is capable of running most NES code in 6502 emulation mode (provided it doesn't rely on any 6502 bugs or illegal opcodes), but every NES register access needs to be replaced with either the SNES equivalent or a custom subroutine, since the PPU and APU are so radically different.
