Nevertheless, when I tried to log in again with the old password, it worked. :)</div><br /><br />Can't explain this behaviour (especially not sure what the &quot;couldn't recover my password&quot; part is -- maybe internally phpBB changed something about the password hashing mechanism.  Remember: forum software got upgraded to something that's 7 years newer.  I cannot stress how completely different the software is.<br /><br />Folks with authentication issues should certainly clear their browser's cookies / saved form data (username/password usually), especially anything relating to nesdev.com.  The reason I recommend this is that there's associations in the cookie itself between the site name/FQDN and the username/password, so cookie bits for nesdev.com won't work/apply to forums.nesdev.com.  Browsers also love saving HTML form data, and I imagine it has to use site name/FQDN for that too (not sure though).<br /><br />One of the <strong>very first things</strong> WhoaMan and I did after the migration was test Email delivery.  I tested the &quot;forgot your password?&quot; method, and I was expecting to get the Email within seconds -- that was not the case.  Mail delivery from the new host goes through Google Apps, and for whatever reason (please don't speculate/judge), takes some time -- for me, about 2-3 minutes.  I did get the recovery Email.  If you have spam filtering in place, folks will need to ensure that they allow mails coming from <!-- e --><a href="mailto:{whatever}@nesdev.com">{whatever}@nesdev.com</a><!-- e --> which is where phpBB will send mails from.  The {whatever} changes based on what's going on in the code; sometimes it's info@, sometimes it's phpbb@.<br /><br />All I can do is speculate as to what's going on.  Myself, I simply visited <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://forums.nesdev.com/">http://forums.nesdev.com/</a><!-- m --> manually and logged in as normal and did said testing.  The fact I'm a site administrator almost certainly has nothing to do with it (not being sarcastic, being serious).

If this kind of behaviour continues (meaning people not getting Emails), WhoaMan may need to look into the whole Email/SMTP ordeal.  Folks should read my post to thefox and be patient when waiting for the mail.  If after 15 minutes nothing's arrived, then there may be something going on under the hood (WhoaMan would need to look at it) which I cannot explain.  The mail delivery &quot;methodology&quot; on the new server is very different from Parodius.

Whether or not that's the root cause is indeterminable (by me at this point).<br /><br />Basically one of the 3 authoritative nameservers for nesdev.com did not have the zone at all, so NXDOMAIN (&quot;no such record&quot;) would have been returned for any DNS lookups when querying that nameserver.  Nameservers are queried in a round-robin or sometimes random fashion (there is no pecking order).  So depending on how the mail server software (on Google's side) is configured, there would be a 1/3 chance of things failing (mail being rejected/ignored by Google) if they were querying that nameserver.  The TXT record portion is extra important since it tells Google Apps what domain should be allowed to send mail through it.<br /><br />It'll take 20-30 minutes for the tertiary provider to pick up the zone, so hopefully that will fix the problem, but I have no visibility into things other than that + don't see any other issues.<br /><br />From what I can tell, this has been broken for quite some time (probably a couple years), and it's entirely 100% my fault.  I simply forgot to update the tertiary DNS provider's stuff to do the AXFR of the zone from the Parodius servers.  It's probably only come to light right now due to the fact that the new host/server/etc. uses nesdev.com exclusively for things.<br /><br />EDIT #2: Things should be better now, but due to the number of changes I had to make**, it may take some time for DNS servers around the world to refresh their caches.  TTL on records is 8 hours, so if you experience odd DNS problems when reaching nesdev.com sites during the next ~7 hours, that's why.  Not much I can do about that; nature of the beast.  But both nameservers (omake.koitsu.org and ns2.afraid.org) do have the zone; DNS lookup errors (NXDOMAIN) would occur if you were querying ns01.parodius.com or ns02.parodius.com (no longer authoritative for nesdev.com).<br /><br />** = I had to work my own migration/Parodius closure bits into the mix too.
