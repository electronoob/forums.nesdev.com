There are people here though who are into GBDev (I'm one of them, but I don't know that much about it). Perhaps it'd be nice if a GBDev forum was opened up like the SNESDev forum here. If you have any questions regarding it, I'm sure you could for now place them in the "General Discussion" area.
<br />
<br />There's decent documentation though. If you google it, you can find some info. If you want GBC info, either google "Pan Docs" or go into the "Gameboy Color Info Wanted" thread. I have a link there that has pretty much the best info around about GBC technical aspects.

<br />
<br />Just sent a PM to Memblers. I don't think we need to vote for this. Either we make a new forum or not. Instead of posting in the general forum people will post in that one. And nobody is forcing anybody to post there so I don't see any issue.  Can't wait to see the posts there since I like that platform too.

If anyone of use wants serious GBdev we could just as well goes there and since the guys that are already over here will figure out that there is people coming they will check the forum more often and that'll be a good thing.

<br />I'm interested in GBdev too, but the surface-mounted technology used inside cartridges was a bit discouraging to me. I don't know how you're supposed to remove the mask ROMs on it and replace them by your own  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_cry.gif" alt=":cry:" title="Crying or Very sad" />

<br />I still have my original Gameboy (and Super GB), but I always liked the NES more.  And it seems like when I was working on this site, there were a lot more Gameboy development sites than NES.  What happened, everyone move on to GBA?

<br />
<br />There are some shortcuts, one that comes to mind is a product called Chip Quik, an alloy that melts at a lower temperature and stays molten long enough to pull off the chip.  It cleans up with solder wick/braid.

<br />As far as I can tell, the GBA scene overwhelmed all. Bung collapsed, stopped selling GBC flash equipment, and appeared to have reformed into Visoly, the company behind the first commercially successful GBA flash card.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />The GBA's processor is well-suited to the C language and ROM space is expansive, so reusable libraries are very practical. This allows abstraction from the hardware, making the learning curve shallower. There is still plenty of room for assembly optimizations, and the processor's architecture is elegant like the 6502, so you don't lose the low-level tinkering ability.
