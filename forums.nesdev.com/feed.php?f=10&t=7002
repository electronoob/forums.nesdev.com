I guess I didn't mention this earlier either, which somewhat explains why I'm willing to rant a lot about it, but like koitsu I use NESASM because I have to.  Sometimes it's teaching people (who are already using it), there's plenty of NESASM-assembled stuff in the Garage Cart #2 compilation, even an NBASIC game (it compiles to NESASM syntax).  I can certainly congratulate people who've never had trouble with it, heheh. <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />MCK depends on NESASM also, it has been widely used.  On my original Squeedo cartridge I had a show-stopping bug that I was never able to track down (having moved on to a better rewrite), I hacked MCK to play music through my synth (IRQ'd to the NES's $4011) but there was some terrible glitching.  I wouldn't be surprised at all if it was something mundane and stupid slipping through NESASM's error-checking.  Wasted a lot of time debugging my PIC and NES code (which worked fine by itself), but, shit happens.  And it's totally worth it that I'm making it with the PIC32 now, instead. <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />NESASM is inescapable, so yeah that's reason enough to discourage it's use among newbies.  With ASM6 one can use those macros posted recently to create an iNES header, and that's a good basic setup that's just as convenient.  At least until someone rewrites NESASM's erroring system (and banking size selectable), I can live with the syntax difference because of the ever-handy search-and-replace function.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=10">Memblers</a> — Thu Oct 07, 2010 3:16 pm</p><hr />

I had no idea there was a nesasm3. I just looked and the only important change is an increase of line length.

I've actually had to to use NESASM.  NESASM 2.x has that bug where label names have to be shorter than a specific number of characters (which bit me when I was attempting to reassemble a public Japanese game from source -- written with NESASM!), otherwise it starts spitting out vague/bizarre errors which you won't easily determine are caused by label names being too long.  NESASM 3.x would just segfault or crash in some way (I forget).  Garbage.  :-)<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3">koitsu</a> — Wed Oct 06, 2010 7:50 pm</p><hr />

Disclaimer: I use ca65.  I've never tried nesasm, neshla, asm6 or others.<br /><br />I also use revision control.  Extensively.  Religiously.  <br /><br />I've recently read the posts about people making various changes to loopy's asm6.  I humbly suggest that loopy consider placing asm6 into some sort of revision control system and granting approved individuals commit access.<br /><br />Loopy, if you'd like, I can host a subversion project and "trac" system for your asm6 on my own server.  I maintain source trees for 20+ projects (mostly private, the largest one is 250,000+ lines of C code).  I have a few public source trees (one being my own aborted attempt a a NES game).  I backup to tape, a second hard-drive, a second computer (all in my house) and to a server at work (it's good to be the network security guy there).  Automated regression tests upon checking are also possible (eg, compile a source file that utilizes most asm6 features and md5 the resulting .nes file).  But my server is x86, so I can't automate testing of a big-endian build.<br /><br />You can also get SVN, CVS, Hg, git or other hosting from a variety of places for free.  Or if you have no desire to do so, you could permit the nesdev community to do the same.<br /><br />The alternative is for several people to maintain their own private branches (possibly using independent rcs systems) and not benefit from a shared repository, commit histories, bug tracking and ownership, etc...<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3664">clueless</a> — Wed Oct 06, 2010 5:28 pm</p><hr />

Parenthesis are used for order of operations like 2*(label+1) so STA (tempAdd),x is <strong>correctly</strong> assembled to STA tempAdd,x.  People using it wrong does not mean bugs.<br /></div><br /><br />What's weird though is that NESASM seems to be the only thing in the 6502-using world that replaces parenthesis with brackets.  All other assemblers I've used also parenthesis for order of operations and they seem to do just fine.  It breaks a tradition that seems to go back maybe 35 years (including lots of source code), for no real advantage.  Then the brackets also are used for something else on 65c816, for long (24-bit) indirection, IIRC.<br /><br />You probably know all this too, but here's an except from the history text that explains the 8kB bank size, and maybe the syntax differences:<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">               - merged the code of the NES and the PCE assembler, now<br />                  there's only one program.<br /></div><br /><br />It's an HuC6280 assembler, primarily.  And that system does have 8kB banks.  The MagicEngine TG16/PCE emulator written by the same author was really great one (and was the only one at the time).<br /><br />WLA-DX was another assembler that had syntax oddities that I complained about too when it was brought up.  Basically for the same reason - it supports multiple CPUs, it's not designed around the 6502.  Again I complained then, that the x816 assembler, as well as CA65, supported 6502/65C816 fully without any sort of weird pseudo-typecasting syntax being needed.<br /><br />Things are a lot better when people are able to share their source code and let other use it.  That's what is great about ASM6, CA65, DASM, and x816.  You will have to change local labels, swap .byte for .db, easy stuff like that.  Try that with NESASM, your bank is going to overflow, it might assemble and take guesses about what the parenthesis mean, it might run slower and be larger without adding stuff to specify zeropage vs absolute, and you're still going to have to change the local labels, heheh.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=10">Memblers</a> — Wed Oct 06, 2010 4:25 pm</p><hr />
