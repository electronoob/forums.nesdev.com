When it finally comes down to the actual soft collision check do people use something like this:<div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">declare function rectRect&#40;x1 as integer, y1 as integer, x2 as integer, y2 as integer, x3 as integer, y3 as integer, x4 as integer, y4 as integer&#41; as integer<br />   if x1 &gt; x4 then return 0<br />   if x2 &lt; x3 then return 0<br />   if y1 &gt; y4 then return 0<br />   if y2 &lt; y3 then return 0<br />   return 1<br />end function</div><br /><br />It's in BASIC but really BASIC is almost pseudo code in readability.

vicious: I'm a terrible teacher, but I still spent a lot of time on <a href="http://nesdev.com/bbs/viewtopic.php?t=8295&amp;postdays=0&amp;postorder=asc&amp;start=0" class="postlink">this topic, so I'll link it.</a> It shows a lot of ways it can go wrong, and why the logic is the way it is with some simple diagrams. If you can deal with words-words-words, my harsh tone, and a few pages of problems that deal with a specific program rather than a general guide, it may be useful.<br /><br />As well, you can find a few super fast ways to do it <a href="http://www.atariage.com/forums/topic/71120-6502-killer-hacks/" class="postlink">here.</a><br /><br />There is stuff that's not collision detection there too,(which is totally worth reading too even if you don't understand it all) since it's not the focus of that topic. But you can see a simple 6502 bounding box routine get simplified and optimized in a way you might be able to understand.<br /><br />That said, I like specific questions. If you end up getting stuck with collision, I will absolutely try to help in my own bumbling way if you post some code or some specific points of a guide you find that you do not understand. <br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">tepples wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"><br />I see your sarcasm, but bounding box collision often does not work in games designed to meet prevailing production values for commercial PC games.<br /></div><br />But this doesn't matter at all because this topic is about NES, and because there are still easy to find guides all around the internet about collision logic that would work on NES. It's not as if all the guides written years ago have suddenly disappeared because 3D/crazy processing power is prevalent now. I guess it's true it's not <em>always</em> the same, but a list of exceptions that don't have much to do with the target platform doesn't need to be given to someone who doesn't need it. It's like finding fault in someone saying random number generator instead of psuedo random, because there's no such thing as a random number generator.<br /><br />Bounding box collision is still useful to teach, and people still write guides about it because it is simple to understand. Also, as you've pointed it, it's useful to try before you even start with more advanced collision, since it will still reject VERY impossible collisions before wasting CPU time doing the more extreme checks for each set of objects. I'd would think a guide that doesn't teach this isn't really useful, because it's skipping a pretty much "free" optimization that can get extreme results depending on the number of objects. And PC games with processing power to spare LOVE lots of objects.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"><br />Players won't stand for what they consider crappy hitboxes, and they'll one-star the game on all the review sites if the instant replay of the moments before a character's death (sometimes called a "killcam") shows a bogus kill.<br /></div><br />True, but this topic is about NES. I have never seen such a feature in any classic game I've played. Except Cattrap (Game Boy), but that game has tile by tile movement anyway. Even if there are old games that do this, or if vicious wanted to do this, it's certainly much harder to program than collision. He'd have to already have a great deal of 6502 knowledge before such a feature would reveal "errors" in his collision detection. And by then I'd bet he'd be able to fix it.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3504">Kasumi</a> — Thu Jun 07, 2012 6:27 pm</p><hr />

The only console I'm aware of that performs useful collision detection in hardware is the Atari 2600. It has bits to indicate collisions between any 2 objects out of the 6 it can display (playfield, player 0, player 1, missile 0, missile 1, ball). Collisions with the playfield might require additional software checking depending on the kind of game (e.g. you might need to tell apart a wall from the floor), but I'm sure lots of games get away with just using the collision bits provided by the TIA.<br /><br />I'm not sure the same approach would work well on the NES, because of the 64 tiny sprites thing. To indicate collisions between any 2 sprites, we'd need 2016 bits. In addition to that, most objects are composed by several sprites, so in order to check for a collision between two objects you'd need to look at all the collision bits involving all the sprites of the first object and the second object. This wouldn't be practical at all, and I'm pretty sure it would be slower than the simple overlapping rectangles technique that's commonly used.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=95">tokumaru</a> — Thu Jun 07, 2012 10:15 am</p><hr />

You won't find tutorials on such specific game topics for the NES. Like it's been said, these concepts are not platform-specific, and the same ideas can be implemented in a multitude of systems. Part of becoming a good programmer is reading about these concepts and making your own implementations in your language/system of choice.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=95">tokumaru</a> — Thu Jun 07, 2012 8:27 am</p><hr />

<div class="quotetitle">Shiru wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"><br />The thing that collision logic is not NES specific in general - it is the same for anything, be it NES, Flash, etc.<br /></div><br />Not necessarily. Different platforms need the geometry represented different ways.<br /><br />Some platforms have the hardware or the CPU power to intersect pixel maps. Atari 2600 and Commodore 64 can intersect sprites in hardware, and PCs since the i486 era can quickly calculate which areas of a pixel map overlap. Other platforms, such as modern PCs and modern consoles and modern smartphones, have the CPU power to intersect of arbitrary polygonal areas or polyhedral volumes. NES has neither and must rely on low-computation software approximations.<br /><br />My Pong clone approximates the ball as a circle and the paddles as rectangles with semicircles on the end (like the Nintendo racetrack logo, except rotated 90 degrees). That's because axis-aligned rectangles and circles are computationally easy to intersect.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=9">tepples</a> — Thu Jun 07, 2012 4:34 am</p><hr />
