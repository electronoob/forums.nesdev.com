		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I have 16 objects, and I have a small table of numbers relatively-prime to 16. Each frame I cycle through the objects adding a relatively-prime number to choose the next object index, and call each object's draw routine in that order (the draw routines just fill up the OAM buffer in linear order as tiles are added). Every frame I just advance to the next number in the table. I always start the index at 0, allowing me to use sprite-0 hit if necessary and to always prioritize one of the objects.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Luckily, my project doesn't require priority, so I use a simple technique that I got from Bregalad where you draw sprites in the order of sprite #1, #3, #7, #10... #58, #61, #0, #2, #5... (except I use sprite #0 so I skip that) and then I think you start from a different index the next frame. This naturally cycles all the sprites.<br /><br />I had an idea. I think it might be beneficial, if you were designing a system were priority is a concern, to never have to worry about priority within a metasprite. When drawing metasprites, the individual sprites can always be cycled. But then you'd have another layer that says what metasprites an object is made of (so you could have multiple metasprites making up an object), which would handle priority of those metasprites. So an object that would normally be one metasprite with defined single sprite priority could be turned into multiple metasprites, which are prioritized by this engine. I'm struggling with words today; I hope that makes some sense.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />An RNG seems like a bad idea. It tends to be 50% whatever on average but since it's not uniform that means there can be runs of one or the other state, thus uneven flickering. Audibly it's like the difference between a low tone and a geiger counter clicking rapidly.

The forward/backward trick is great, but sprites will disappear completely if there is more than 16 on the scanline, and if there is like 9 of them, two of them will be flickering in a much worse way than if it was random (or sort-of-random).

(They also combined it with the forward/backward technique, but it doesn't really look much different in my opinion)
