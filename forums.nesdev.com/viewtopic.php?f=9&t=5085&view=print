		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Greetings...seems I'm having a lot of trouble these days. I've lost a screw to one of my carts. I realize that the NES screws are made for those "special bits" but I'm just going to buy a flathead equivalent like some of the early games had. Could you just let me know the type of screw that they used on the NES, both thread and length? Basically I need the same information that you can take down to the Ace Hardware store to pick up the screws.

<br />Thanks!

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I can't find this information anywhere on the internet and since I haven't received any replies on the various messageboards about this, I guess that I am the first person to look into this who feels the need to "spread the word". I could not find an exact match as people have been telling me but I found that a #3-48 screw is close enough to work. 
<br />
<br />I thought that I'd put this out there so that anyone else who needs to know will be able to get some screws.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Addendum:
<br />
<br />I have now found that #2-56 screws are just about perfect. They're nearly the same size as the NES screws and will thread themselves into the plastic but they are not as large as the #3-48 screws which caused the screw holders on my cart to start cracking.

<br />
<br />Aren't the NES cartridge and NES console screws reverse/inverted Torx?
<br />
<br />You can buy the bits which open them, you know.  They're available all over the place.
<br />
<br />My advice is to keep the original screws and just buy the bits needed to open the console/carts.  $15 tops, for both bits.  I think I got mine for around $12 online somewhere.
