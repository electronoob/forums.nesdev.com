Internally, the console was modified by rewiring a couple of pins on the multi-out socket to carry the clock signal (instead of S-video Y and C if I recall).

In 60Hz mode, the initial curtain-raising appears in colour. After the SMB logo comes down and the background changes from black to beige, the picture goes monochrome. Also there is occasional "noise" in the upper part of the picture. On starting a game, the world map appears fine, but entering the first level the picture goes mono again. The background being a light colour, particularly at the left-hand side of the picture appears to cause this problem. Some other games seemed to work fine though, e.g. Mega Man 3 (US).<br /><br />I'll open it up and check that Vcc is at the correct level.

It's explained in the patent linked above, it's relatively simple or more to the point, much cheaper than a full standards converter while still allowing 50Hz operation.<br /><br />I haven't traced out the circuit of the actual console yet, but from the diagram in the patent, the converter chip receives as input the 21MHz clock, /IRQ, /WE and /200X. It outputs PPUCLK and /IRQ'. So the chip does control the PPU clock.<br /><br />It would use /WE and /200X to determine when the CPU is trying to access the PPU. As for /IRQ, I'm not sure whether that refers to the CPU /IRQ line (pin 32) or PPU /INT (pin 19, connects to CPU NMI pin on a normal NES).<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=316">mark_k</a> — Wed Jul 22, 2009 2:53 am</p><hr />

Well it would ideally halt the PPU for 51 scanlines in each frame. But if the CPU accesses the PPU during the period when it is halted, the PPU is clocked, i.e. the CPU can access the PPU during the halted period. So in that case the PPU is effectively halted for something less than 51 scanlines, which means the frame is shorter than it should be. Hence the slight picture/sync disturbance when that happens.<br /><br />With that in mind, it should be quite easy to detect whether you're running on an HK Famicom in 50Hz mode. It might also be possible to vary the frame rate, e.g. by accessing the PPU enough at the correct time you might be able to increase the frame rate to 51Hz, say. (Not very useful.)<br /><br />(I haven't verified this by hooking the console up to an oscilloscope or anything. And all this only applies when the console is in 50Hz a.k.a. SLOWER mode. When in 60Hz NORMAL mode it should be completely compatible with a normal Famicom, lower clock speed aside.)<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=316">mark_k</a> — Thu Jul 09, 2009 3:30 pm</p><hr />

So does this mean that it halts the PPU even during forced blanking?  Of course, games will merrily continue writing their data for the PPU during that time.<br />I'm guessing that games made by Micronics (Ghosts n goblins, 1942, Athena, Tiger Heli, etc) with their slow load times are probably more compatible with this console.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=53">Dwedit</a> — Mon Jul 06, 2009 5:00 pm</p><hr />

A little update on this...<br /><br />On the first TV I tested the console with, the 60Hz picture appeared in colour but the 50Hz picture was in monochrome. However after adjusting the fine tuning I did get the 50Hz picture to show in colour. (No idea why only the 50Hz picture had that problem!)<br /><br />On another older TV, there was no colour problem in 50Hz mode. But that TV has manual tuning only.<br /><br />I have noticed that with many games (e.g. Castlevania, Super Mario Bros 3), there is a momentary picture disturbance in 50Hz mode, when starting a game or on some other visual transition. One game which reliably shows that is Joshua (Wisdom Tree); pressing Select to cycle between screens before starting a game causes the disturbance. This is probably due to the PPU being accessed when it is halted, for the reason I guessed at above?<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=316">mark_k</a> — Mon Jul 06, 2009 1:14 pm</p><hr />

I'll have to test some more PAL NES carts (which might have longer vblank routines) on the console and see whether the effect in 50Hz mode is the same as in 60Hz mode (i.e. same as when used on a normal NTSC console).<br /><br />In the case where the CPU accesses the PPU in the "halted period" (and the access is allowed by clocking the PPU), that could disrupt the video signal, which might explain the effect I saw with PAL Rad Racer in 50Hz mode.<br /><br />As far as the PPU is concerned, it outputs a normal NTSC signal (it's not aware that time stops for those extra 51 scanlines). But what if the CPU accesses the PPU during the extra lines? Each access causes the PPU to be clocked. So when the extra 51 line time is over and the PPU clock is restored, it will be a few cycles "further along" than it otherwise would be.<br /><br />If during the extra scanlines the CPU accesses the PPU enough times corresponding to half a scanline, the video signal output by the PPU would then be half a line ahead of where it should be. (Does that make any sense?)<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=316">mark_k</a> — Wed Jul 01, 2009 3:15 pm</p><hr />

Hi,<br /><br />It will use NTSC-like timing. Regarding the length of vblank, I have not run any test code on the console yet. For compatibility I would think the console is essentially halted during the "extra" vblank time. Well, the PPU will be halted, but the CPU is probably not.<br /><br />The patent (<a href="http://v3.espacenet.com/publicationDetails/originalDocument?FT=D&amp;date=19990210&amp;DB=EPODOC&amp;locale=en_EP&amp;CC=EP&amp;NR=0512861A2&amp;KC=B1" class="postlink">European patent 512861</a>) mentions there being an extra 51 scanlines in vblank when in 50Hz mode. And from paragraph 53: "On the other hand, since the operation of the PPU is stopped during a clock stopped period, if the CPU intends to access the PPU, the CPU cannot access the PPU. Such a matter becomes an obstacle to the job of the CPU. Then, in this embodiment shown, the PPU clock stopped state is released when the CPU intends to access the PPU so that the CPU can access the PPU even if the PPU clock is stopped."<br /><br />But allowing the CPU to access the PPU during the extra vblank time would surely reduce compatibility??? I need to test the console with as many games as possible to see if there are any issues; I haven't tried many yet. One I did try was a PAL Rad Racer cart. On a normal NTSC console there are graphical glitches. There were also glitches on the HK Famicom in 60Hz mode, as you would expect. In 50Hz mode I was expecting the same glitches, and they seemed to be present. But in addition, it looked like the display sync was being interfered with.<br /><br />The 50Hz picture may have appeared in black-and-white on my TV if there is no colour burst on the extra blank scanlines, which might cause that particular TV to show the whole picture in monochrome.<br /><br />-- M<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=316">mark_k</a> — Wed Jul 01, 2009 5:53 am</p><hr />
