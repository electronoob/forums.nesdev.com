I guess I didn't put two and two together, your test rom even told me this.  I've been ignoring PRG a13 the whole time...  My boards have this line split for 8KB PRG banks (mmc3) and they lack a solder jumper to remind me of this.  I'll get it fixed up in the code tonight, hopefully that'll be all it takes to get er up and running!

One thing to note, I realized routing PRG R/W to WRAM /WE, and PRG_A13 to PRG-ROM_A13 costs 1 macrocell a peice.  If we're looking to save logic in the future, these signals can be routed via wires/jumpers to make room for other logic.  I don't have the jumpers on my PCBs so the CPLD is handling those signals right now for ease.  That and we've got logic to spare, so not really a concern for now.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">tepples wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">Now try the Control Pad and see how the bank numbers respond.

So either I messed up the script, there's and issue with the script, or my understanding of how the mapper is supposed to work is wrong.  If I'm understanding the mapper behavior wrong then it should be an easy fix because it appears to be operating how I'd expect, I just need to fix my lack of understanding and the problem will present its self... <img src="./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" /><br /><br />EDIT: So it looks like cpow and I had/have some similar confusion looking back at the previous discussion:<br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">With the outer bank set to $2A, the 16K banks used by 32K mode are $54 and $55, and the top half of this is $55. More commonly for a ROM of his size, the outer bank would be set to $2F, which produces the expected UOROM-alike last bank in the fixed slot.</div><br /><br />I think I'm getting it now...<br /><br />It kinda stems back to some previous private discussions we had Tepples.  I think you've got it set up so that the fixed bank is the current bank, not necessarily the last or the first.  My implementation assumes it's the last/first bank that it gets fixed to.  Is it beneficial to fix to the current bank vice the last/first?  As I remember it consumes more logic to fix the current bank.  But for this mapper implementation we've got some logic to spare, so I can change it to fix to the current bank assuming that's what we want.  So would this then allow for two smaller possibly non-power of 2 sized games to fit into one larger 'UNROM slot' then?<br /><br />EDIT 2:  I coded it up for the fixed to current outer_bank behavior and fixed up everything.  Didn't cost any extra logic or anything either.  Everything matches the output of the script now <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />  I also updated the wiki code.  So everything should be good there now and fairly 'final'.  Guess I was right about finding my misunderstanding of the behavior and revealing the problem.<br /><br />Aside from the 32KB CHR RAM issues Tepples should be able to continue testing/development with NESICIDE.  The 32KB CHR RAM isn't really planed to be made use of for the 'action15 bundle feat. Streemerz' right?  Additionally thefox should be able to take my verilog and dump it into mapper #28 of power pak mappers to allow for additional testing.  The one thing to keep in mind when he does that though is default/startup values my code doesn't actually cover that, it's a setting in the fitting properties of Xilinx webpack.  Although I don't know how necessary all that is until the ROM is more finalized and we can be more sure that their won't be alterations of the mapper.  Now that we've got this test up and running in an emu and hardware we should have most details ironed out in order to proceed with what we currently have.

I seem to remember that Who's Cuter was this way before I improved its CHR compression to fit in 64K.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">Aside from the 32KB CHR RAM issues Tepples should be able to continue testing/development with NESICIDE.</div><br /><em>(tepples looks in Gitorious commit logs)</em><br />Apparently <a href="https://gitorious.org/nesicide/nesicide/commit/82093e500ba0c511ed956f71ac6e4b22bd877eba" class="postlink">commit 82093e5</a> added this mapper. My Linux laptop isn't beefy enough to run NESICIDE, but I have access to a faster Windows machine. Are there any publicly available Windows binaries with this commit?

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I'm having a problem getting AOROM style 1-screen mirroring to work.<br /><br />When mirroring is 1-screen (port $80 bit 1 is false), writes to bit 4 of port $00 and bit 4 of port $01 are supposed to change bit 0 of the mirroring mode. But for some reason, they're not appearing to take effect.<br /><br />I made a new version of the test ROM with these changes:<br /><ul><li>If COMSPEC is present (that is, if running under Windows), the makefile adds Python 2.7 to the PATH. GNU Make (MSYS version) can't seem to find the installed .py handler otherwise. </li><li>I've started to add a fifth line of hex numbers. The first two bytes are related to whether the results match the assembly language version of <tt style="margin-left: 2px; margin-right: 2px; padding:3px; background-color: #3355aa; color: white;">calc_prg_bank</tt>, and the first should be 00 if PRG bank mode is working correctly (or 80 or C0 if it's screwed up). The third is the detected mirroring mode, as described below. </li></ul><br />Mirroring modes are read back as follows:<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">7654 3210<br />|||| |||+- Current bank $00, $2000<br />|||| ||+-- Current bank $10, $2000<br />|||| |+--- Current bank $00, $2400<br />|||| +---- Current bank $10, $2400<br />|||+------ Current bank $00, $2800<br />||+------- Current bank $10, $2800<br />|+-------- Current bank $00, $2C00<br />+--------- Current bank $10, $2C00<br /></div><br />These five values are meaningful:<br /><ul><li>00: 1-screen mirroring, page 0 </li><li>FF: 1-screen mirroring, page 1 </li><li>AA: 1-screen mirroring, page defined by bit 4 </li><li>CC: Horizontal arrangement (vertical mirroring) </li><li>F0: Vertical arrangement (horizontal mirroring) </li></ul>If the registers are written in the order $80 then $01, then increasing bank modes from 00 to 03 are supposed to return AA, AA, CC, F0. If the registers are written $01 then $80, then increasing bank modes from 00 to 03 are supposed to return 00, FF, CC, F0. I <em>think</em> my code is writing to $80 then $01, but NESICIDE appears to be ignoring the writes to bit 4 of $01 for some reason.<br /><br />So I opened it up in NESICIDE, set a breakpoint for read_mode_x_bank_y (CPU executes at $0453), and went to work. I noticed that the nametable visualizer in NESICIDE reacts instantly when I press F8 to step to the next instruction. This is convenient; FCEUX's doesn't. The display of mirroring and internals in Debugger &gt; Cartridge &gt; Information is convenient as well. The write at $455 changes the mirroring to 1-screen (and changes the page as well); the write at $46B should change it to the first or second page, but it doesn't.<br /><br />I don't know if it's a bug in NESICIDE or a bug in my test, but either way, it'd prevent Battletoads from running correctly.<br /><br /><br />EDIT: Quads get. By coincidence, <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/viewtopic.php?p=101111#p101111" class="postlink">the previous quads</a> was the post where #28 was assigned.
