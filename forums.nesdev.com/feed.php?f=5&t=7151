I just thought up a fairly simple slot-based animation system that would work well on the SNES.  Divide the sprite pattern table into 16 slots of 8 16x16 sprites.  Any enemy or objesct can look for 1 or several unused slot, use the slot, or retire the slot.  Slots can be used for real time animation updates for enemies as big as 32x64, or slots can be used to hold several needed animation frames for smaller characters and objects that are used within a specific area.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=4383">psycopathicteen</a> — Sun Dec 12, 2010 5:10 pm</p><hr />

That sounds really complicated.<br /></div><br /><br />Fun thing is though that this algorithm was originally designed for page replacement for processor caches, or for paging for virtual memory, but it can be used in many different places too.<br /><br />So let's say it's just a way of having a huge number of "virtual" tile numbers from some expansive bank of ROM, and far less "physical" tile slots to put them in.<br />You could do it for the background, so a background could be specified just using a wide range of virtual tile numbers, then they are loaded and unloaded as needed when they become physical tile numbers.<br />Or you could do it for sprites too.<br /><br />Data structures used:<br />* Mapping between virtual tile numbers =&gt; physical tile numbers.  A lookup or hash table works here, but pure lookup tables might be too big.  Needs to be fast, because there are a ton of lookups.<br />* Mapping between physical tiles =&gt; virtual tile numbers.  It's so the you know for each physical tile which virtual tile is mapped in there.<br />* Reference Count or "Locked" flag for physical tiles so you know which ones are in use, so they shouldn't be expired.<br />* If you want, a "this was used recently" bit to indicate give a tile a second chance before it's replaced.<br />* A cursor (just an integer) telling which tile gets replaced next.<br /><br />Operations:<br />* The only real operations are Fetch, Lock/Increment reference, and Unlock/Decrement reference.<br />* Fetch: You request a given tile, and it returns where it is, or replaces something so you can get it.  If you use the second chance bit, indicate that it gets a second chance.<br />* Replace: Called from fetch.  Skip everything that's locked.  If it has a second chance, it loses that, and skip it.<br />* Pre-Load: Maybe you want stuff to be in the cache even though it isn't currently being used yet.<br /><br />How to use it for backgrounds:<br />* When tiles go in (exposing new area for scrolling), check if the tile is in the cache, increment it.<br />* When tiles go out, decrement it.<br />* For animated tiles, you have two choices, either animate the physical tiles and leave the virtual tiles constant, or change the virtual tiles on the map.<br /><br />How to use it for sprites:<br />* Look up everything before you do any replacements, so you don't throw out actively used stuff.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=53">Dwedit</a> — Sat Nov 27, 2010 4:01 pm</p><hr />

NES games that have very detailed animation going on are probably going to use CHR-ROM and if possible 1K CHR Banks. As Bregalad said you have too little time to use CHR-RAM and still update all the patterns you need to. Battletoads manages to pull off alot. But it is at the top of the pack. It pushes the limits probably. Most games work on a much slower pace only loading CHR-RAM between scenes. Or like 1943, it will slowly update CHR-RAM as you progress through the level so by the time you get to where new tiles are used they are loaded.<br /><br />Some NES games, like Crisis Force, use CHR-ROM 1K banking for some really neat effects that happen just because of changing the pattern data banked in. Like in the first level there is a vertical running trench that parallax scrolls. <br /><br />On SNES with DMA you can probably afford to just DMA alot of patterns from ROM or WRAM banks $7E&amp;7F. But you'll still have limits. You just have to decide what works best for you and your game.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=1726">MottZilla</a> — Thu Nov 25, 2010 3:09 pm</p><hr />

In fact aside of Battletoads, it was extremely uncommon to use such as "slot" system on the NES, as opposed to what is seen on other systems. The low ROM-&gt;VRAM bandwith is the reason for this.<br />99% of games just have banks of graphics which are loaded once in a level, or that are switched as animations need to change, such as in SMB3, allowing for more a detailed main character and / or more main characters.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=38">Bregalad</a> — Thu Nov 25, 2010 2:48 pm</p><hr />

Now that we're on the subject of animation, how do "animation slots" work.  Most games don't have uniform sized sprites.  Smaller slots mean smaller objects/characters, but bigger slots mean less objects/characters onscreen.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=4383">psycopathicteen</a> — Thu Nov 25, 2010 12:59 pm</p><hr />

Which reminds of when I played some Gradius game on the PSP. A coworker had brought it with him to show a passage in the game that he was unable to get past (some kinda rotating obstacles IIRC). I made it through on the first try.<br /><br />At first he couldn't understand how I did it while he got killed all the time, but then he figured it out: I was pressing the fire button repeatedly even when there were no enemies on the screen - this slowed the game down sufficiently that getting through those obstacles became much easier.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=1181">mic_</a> — Thu Nov 25, 2010 4:38 am</p><hr />
