I use mostly emulators on my PC to play games, which prevents me to get graphical glitches or random freezes, which happens frequently enough on the real NES. For this reason I don't understand why people insist so much to play games on real hardware.

I made myself a few (3) bootlegs, but I never use them so I realized that I just wasted games for nothing (of course if the original game is bad this isn't a problem). This is also a reason I'm against all of this, if you don't sell the bootleg, you are amazed that you did it and play it maybe 3 times then it all goes to waste. I killed one of them to make a true devkart (with sockets) instead, and that way it became somewhat useful.<br /><br />I vowed to never answer any of Sivak's questions or anyone who ask for illegitimate bootlegs again, but it doesn't prevent other people to answer them. There is a whole load of people submitting those forums for bootlegs alone. 5 years ago or so it was a whole new things, and people (including myself) were very exited with them. But now for some reason I think there is way too much people asking for them.<br />Like in the early 2000s you could go anywhere and ask for ROMs this wasn't a problem.

<br />
<br />There is also people who individually sell bootlegs on ebay or a similar site - often as if it was the real thing.

<br />If downloading a backup of a game you don't have is an infringement, then writing a game you don't have on a cartridge is a squared infringement. Not only you have to do the former infingement in order to do that, but also, if you add a fake label to the bootleg, it creates a fake cartridge, which, if sold, is a scam.
<br />
<br />So it's at least the same infringement as if the ROM were downloaded, and possibly worse. Which I don't understand why it's more tolerated than just downloading ROMs. I'm not in a it's good/it's bad debate (I know it can be good to destroy a bad game to put a better game on it) but more in a tolerated / not tolerated debate.

<br />If I tear up an Ice Hockey to make a BombSweeper, or I tear up a Tetris (Nintendo version) or I Can Remember to make a Concentration Room+LJ65 multicart, whose copyright am I infringing? And because most game PCBs use either Nintendo mask ROM pinout or JEDEC pinout, the instructions to reproduce a homebrew game will closely resemble those to reproduce a non-free commercial game.
<br />
<br />As for giving instructions specific to a specific non-free commercial game, that's not clearly legit. But you might be seeing a difference in legal tradition between that in your country and that in the home of Parodius Networking. Here in the United States,[1] we operate under a legal system descended from English common law rather than a legal system descended from the Napoleonic Code. Under the common law, the courts make law by filling in gaps left by legislators. When a court decides a case, it can make a rule, called a "precedent", which lower courts in the same judicial circuit must follow when deciding future cases with similar facts. In effect, this makes case law as powerful as statutes if not more powerful.
<br />
<br />I'm guessing repro instructions are more tolerated because nobody has yet got in trouble for giving instructions that apply to substantial non-infringing uses (in this case homebrew) just as well as they apply to clear infringement, and the Supreme Court of the United States has set a precedent to look favorably on substantial non-infringing uses.
<br />

<br />I think that the support we regular posters offer is limited. We're not all going to stick around forever... Some of us will surely lose interest in NES development, others will get pissed for unknown reasons and vanish from the boards (like Quietust).

<br />Good point about "milking" those of us while we're still interested, though I think unless it's made into something (put in the Wiki), it becomes less useful over time as mere postings in threads. There's so much noise mixed in the forums (not that it can be improved; that's the nature of discussion).

<br />You can't be that stupid about repros, are you?  nesreproductions.com charges $25 per repro, and the buyer has to supply the donor cart.  His cost is 1 or 2 ROM chips ($2-6), a label ($1), shipping ($2-5) and about 15 minutes of time.  Not even close to $25.  He absolutely makes profit on every cart sold.  
<br />
<br />The word "fake" isn't anywhere on the website.  Where is it "clearly stated"?
