You can detect what Game Boy system the game is running on by reading the accumulator after boot. If it's $FF it's either a Game Boy Pocket or Super Game Boy 2. Tetris DX does this to check if it's running on a SGB2, and if it does it will load up a different SGB border.

You'd need a short 65816 routine to clear bit 7 of <tt style="margin-left: 2px; margin-right: 2px; padding:3px; background-color: #3355aa; color: white;">$6003</tt> (according to <a href="http://www.dforce3000.de/pub/d4s_super_gameboy_notes.pdf" class="postlink">http://www.dforce3000.de/pub/d4s_super_gameboy_notes.pdf</a>). This would reset the GB side, and then you would need to <tt style="margin-left: 2px; margin-right: 2px; padding:3px; background-color: #3355aa; color: white;">JMP</tt> to the reset vector SNES-side to allow recovering from the SGB <tt style="margin-left: 2px; margin-right: 2px; padding:3px; background-color: #3355aa; color: white;">JUMP</tt> command.<br /><br />Actually, I wonder if the reset handler of the Super Game Boy already causes a GB CPU reset on startup? Then your routine could just <tt style="margin-left: 2px; margin-right: 2px; padding:3px; background-color: #3355aa; color: white;">JMP &#40;$FFFC&#41;</tt> and skip the <tt style="margin-left: 2px; margin-right: 2px; padding:3px; background-color: #3355aa; color: white;">$6003</tt> writes altogether.

There are other cards more suitable for chiptune musicians.  There is something of a tradeoff between the flashing speed of the EDGB and the vast amount of ROMs available on an SD card, but a 4MB ROM can be flashed in under a minute.  Its also has vastly improved compatibility for games.  Compared to the klunky interfaces and limited ROM support of the LSDJ cards, it is a revelation.  Krikzz is also planning to release RAM-based versions of some of his flash Everdrives (SNES, Master Sytstem, Game Gear, Turbo Grafx-16 and Game Boy) which should make complaints about loading times disappear.

At the very least some form of naive wear leveling would have been a nice upgrade.<br /><br />The reason the speed is irritating is that I found myself more frequently choosing games I know and being less willing to explore new ones - if it's going to take so damn long I had better know I will enjoy the game. At that speed, you can compete with the device using an old EPROM dev cart and a 29F* Flash ROM with a PC-based burner. Obviously no competition for portability, but it's just remarkable how long it takes.
