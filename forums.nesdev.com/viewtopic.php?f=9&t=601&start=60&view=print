<br />I tried the above, and the image quality is still not perfect.  My PPU is socketed.  I even lifted pin 21 and ran the wire directly to Q1.  It is much cleaner, but not perfect.
<br />
<br />There have been rumours that Nintendo fixed these systems for customers that complained.  I wonder what they did!

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Hmmm.....mine looked pretty darn good - I'm wondering if the AV mod I did may effect it a little, since the pathway leading under the VRAM now has a much stronger signal.  Perhaps re-routing the signal coming out of the transistor to the modulator aome other way may elimininate more interference.  Actually, the VRAM was one of my original suspects, since some of my vs. arcade boards also have these lines, but only when certain video pages are being used.  I also noticed that if I run my Famicom off of the +5V supply of my NES (with the CPU &amp; PPU removed from the NES to reduce power consumption), the Famicom would get the lines, so the power supply may be contributing to the problem in some way.

The local Nintendo repair center wouldn't work on it, but Nintendo let me ship it off, and they put in a new board that had a much cleaner picture, but not perfect.  As far as I could tell, the only difference on the board was that it had an Alps modulator instead of the usual Mitsumi modulator, and the CPU &amp; PPU had "H" suffixes instead of "G" suffixes that were on my old board (this is why I strongly disagree with the rumors that the "H" PPU is the problem - why, then, did I have BETTER picture with the board with an "H" PPU?).  Unfortunately I no longer have that board to look for other differences - my house got flooded a few years ago, so it went back to Nintendo, this time being completely replaced with a refurbished unit with the older board &amp; chipset.

<br />Has anyone tried replacing the modulator in the top loader unit to see if that fixes the problem?  I know this is an old thread, but I still play my NES 2 and would love to have this fixed - one day.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />It's me again - well.....it's been years since I've actually tried replacing a modulator in the top-loading NES (I just ended up going to AV until I did an RGB conversion), but if I remember correctly, a better modulator can improve the picture a little, but it certainly won't improve it a lot.  Though I've had mixed opinions for a while, I now think that RGB is the best way to go, as long as you use resistors to bleed the 3 channels just a little - this reduces the heavily saturated look that the RGB PPUs are plagued with, and improves a lot of the colors, making most games look close to the original NES graphics, only much clearer.  The background will still look kind of saturated on Zelda and the brown objects on Super Mario Bros. will still be a little too bright, but it's not too bad.  And by the way, an RGB conversion will pretty much clear up most of the vertical line problem.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Hi Folks, sorry for bringing this back from the dead, but I decided to go back to this, and try a small experiment.  I used the same circuit as the original one in this thread, but this time I wired up the circuit differently, and guess what. IT WORKED!!!
<br />
<br />I finally have clean, as good and as bright picture coming out of the toploader as I ever had coming from the front loader.
<br />
<br />Here's what you need to do:
<br />
<br />- build the same "new" amplifier as shown in the beginning of this thread.  Mount it on top of the top shield (double sided tape foam works great)
<br />- Lift the video pin on NES video chip (PPU pin 21)
<br />- use 24 gauge multistrand wire to run between the video pin and input to amplifier (old IDE cable works great here!)
<br />- take an old ethernet cable, and cut it open.  Use twisted pair wire from it, and run Vcc to amp from Vcc from video chip (PPU pin 40).  Use other wire its twisted to to run GND (PPU pin 20)
<br />- Use another pair of twisted pair wire from ethernet cable and run GND and Video out from amp to the RCA plug.
<br />
<br />By keeping the GND and Vcc sources as close as possible to the PPU, and video out, and using twisted pair wire, you are able to completly block out all noise!
<br />
<br />The picture is clean, and perfect (even on SMB1 which shows the vertical lines most easily).  There are NONE!
<br />
<br />good luck!

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I have an extra top loader here that I tried to bring back to life.  It seems that the 1B4B1 bridge rectifier on it is gone.  I pulled it out, and connected one of the the AC plugs to +, and the other to -.  I then used a DC adapter set to 9V to see if the unit will power on.  And it did!
<br />
<br />Except now instead of vertical bars, it has wavy bars.  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />  (so there goes the idea of converting the unit to run DC like an SNES rather than AC-AC)
<br />
<br />I think the reason that the top loader video output is so bad is because the RF modulator is so close the AC/DC power converter!
<br />
<br />The front loader has them on the same board as well, but there's at least 2-3 times the distance between the outlets!
<br />
<br />Everything about the top loader seems to have been shrunk.  Rather than diodes, and 1B4B1 is used.  Must smaller crystal, etc.
<br />
<br />What a nightmare of a unit.  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />What would happen if you removed the modulator and did not replace it with anything, using the A/V mod instead?  Woudl the need for shielded cables disappear?  I ask because putting the A/V out in the hole where the modulator output was seems a logical place for it and it would not necessitate cutting a hole elsewhere in the case.  On the other hand, it may be too close to the AC-DC conversion circuitry. 
<br />
<br />I found that the vertical lines were most easily noticeable on a game with solid gray backgrounds. Slalom is the game I use to demonstrate the problem or lack thereof.  Fiddling with the brightness and contrast may also be necessary to "know" they are gone.  
<br />
<br />How close do the colors/brightness/contrast appear on this new mod compared to an AV Famicom or a front loader NES AV output?

<br />
<br />like it or not, holes need to be cut, otherwise you have only video and no audio.  I never tried removing the current RF modulator, but it doesn't work (since video out pin in PPU is lifted).
<br />
<br />The video quality itself is identical to the front loader (I did an A/B comparison while both systems were running!).  I don't have a famicom toploader AV, so can't compare to it.
<br />
<br />As far as AC/DC converter is concerned, I'm not sure the problem is there.  Even if you use a DC input (which works!) the system still had the vertical lines.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />i see there hasn't been much activity on this thread for a few months , and even less for months before . i would like to thank all of you who contributed . i applied this mod last night after some difficulty with the one described here :
<br />
<br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.gamesx.com/rgbadd/nes2avmod.htm">http://www.gamesx.com/rgbadd/nes2avmod.htm</a><!-- m -->
<br />
<br />it seems that one is quite sensitive to the model of transistor that is used , and i was unable to find the "easy to find" transistor .
<br />
<br />the great thing about the mod described in this thread is that you don't have to find a transistor at all . in fact , the only parts needed are a few resistors and capacitors .
<br />
<br />for those who did not know , it is possible to modify the circuit by using the Q1 transistor that is already on the board . in this way , you can avoid lifting any IC pins , and you can also prevent the hassle of running a 4th wire to your mod circuit for ground .
<br />
<br />what i did first was a step described on the gamesX mod . i removed resistor r3 and then cut the tiny trace running underneath it .
<br />
<br /><img src="http://img402.imageshack.us/img402/4042/nes2avr3ou6.gif" alt="Image" />
<br />stolen from gamesX
<br />
<br />this may have been an unnecessary injury to the board , as i believe the trace runs to the RF unit , and the same effect would be achieved by removing the next resistor to the right , and making no cuts .
<br />
<br />next i prepared this reduced variation of the schematic presented in this thread earlier :
<br />
<br /><img src="http://img259.imageshack.us/img259/4750/hvc101r1videoes1.gif" alt="Image" />
<br />
<br />the input lead of the circuit can be soldered to the backside contact for Q1 , or it can be connected to the contact of the connecting resisor to its left (as seen from top) .
<br />
<br />i got my +5 (red) from this pin in the top center of the backside . green is nothing . it is supposd to be for RF mod but we aren't using that . the concact labeled audio was run to a stereo miniplug jack , as was video out from our circuit .
<br />
<br /><img src="http://img250.imageshack.us/img250/97/nes2avdz4.jpg" alt="Image" />
<br />stolen from gamesX
<br />
<br />ground is also connected to the appropriate pin of the minijack .
<br />
<br /><img src="http://www.gamesx.com/grafx/nes2av2.jpg" alt="Image" />
<br />stolen form gamesX .
<br />
<br />that's it . plug a phono miniplug to 2RCA cable into the jack and you are ready to go . almost all remains of the vertical bars are gone , and color and brightness are perfect and beautiful .

<br />FC2 is a ferrite bead it helps reduce noise (EMI/RFI) in the video circuit

<br />
<br />I got a top loader the other day, and am very interested in this mod. Unfortunately, the original link ( <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://darthcloud.da.funpic.org/img/bypass.html">http://darthcloud.da.funpic.org/img/bypass.html</a><!-- m --> ) doesn't work, and I have no idea what's going on.
<br />
<br />I'm more of a visual guy anyway, I was wondering if Leonk or someone else could pitch together a small little guide? Sifting through everything in this thread, it's hard to tell which posts are successful mods, and which ones are back-to-the-drawing-boards.
<br />
<br />Also, thought I should add that I got my NES already A/V modded, it's the old mod, hopefully this won't ruin chances of getting the new mod to work. Not sure if the mod was done correctly or not, though...A/V seems to work just fine, but RF gets me mostly gray screen with some slightly scrambled graphics.
<br />
<br />Anyway, hoping I'll get some replies here =) Now all I need to do is figure out how to get these dang screws out.
<br />
<br />Oh yeah, and is RockyRogue's guide fairly accurate? Says that ALMOST all of the lines are gone?
<br />
<br />One more edit, leonk posted this: "build the same "new" amplifier as shown in the beginning of this thread", is he referring to the bypass.html broken link?
<br />
<br />Okay, I'm done with my terribly rambling post, now =)
