To answer part of your confusion, there are kind of two parts to displaying sprites.<br /><br />There's the sprite itself, which is always 8x8 or 8x16.<br /><br />Then there's the set of sprite tiles which are used to display sprites. If you use 8x8 sprites, each sprite uses 1 8x8 sprite tile. If you use 8x16 sprites, each sprite uses 2 adjacent 8x8 sprite tiles. But even using those two 8x8 tiles, it still only counts as 1 sprite.<br /><br />So in theory, with 8x16 sprites you can cover twice as many pixels of the screen as you can with 8x8 sprites.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3504">Kasumi</a> — Tue May 01, 2018 7:08 pm</p><hr />

Yes mr nesrocks, you are quite right, and you image you posted first with my sprites is exactly how I would do it for a chr file. I have a software that will remove duplications and images that are mirrored. Optimising it as you say. No one might use the assets, but il make them anyway as its part of making my assets more universal. They are released public domain anyway so they could be used and edited, modified in whatever way the user wanted, so may be useful just for a demo or conceptual works. <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />I really appreciate your last post, il check that software out as I haven't experimented with that one yet.

I see, that's great then! Always good to have free assets <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /><br /><br />To answer your question, yes a sprite is 8x8 or 8x16, and it uses one palette of a transparent color + 3 colors. It can also be positioned anywhere on the screen, and 64 of them can be displayed at any time. What exactly got you confused about what a sprite is?<br /><br />The thing is your image was kind of confusing, and for a not too complicated character. So it didn't really need different sprites just to show the skin color for example. For that particular character design, it's probably best to do it the way I described, unless some specific resource necessity calls for a shift in resource usage priority (&quot;resources&quot; being palette usage, CHR usage or sprite usage, for example).<br /><br />Although people would probably not use free assets &quot;as they are&quot;, it's going to look better if the assets are designed with some degree of optimization for the desired platform. In this case I feel that 4 CHR tiles, drawn using 6 sprites with 2 palettes is a good way to go. Some of your examples use 6 CHR tiles, and/or 10 sprites, and/or 3 palettes.<br /><br />If you open this game on fceux:<br /><img src="https://i.imgur.com/LknzCgL.png" alt="Image" /><br /><br />Then you use spidey's lua script that shows hex values for the sprites on screen you'll get this:<br /><img src="https://i.imgur.com/l1oOEKB.png" alt="Image" /><br /><br />It shows exactly everything that is not a background, and how they are positioned on the screen. It's a nice way to see what are sprites.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=7152">nesrocks</a> — Tue May 01, 2018 3:16 pm</p><hr />

hi, sorry for my late reply.<br /><br />OK, dam, i thought i had it figured out, you all must must think i'm an idiot. that's cool, me wife does as well. <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />Let me just explain what i am trying to do as i think i haven't explained myself properly. I am not creating a game, nor am i developing a game with a NES system.(i may one day, but not yet). I am trying to learn how to create genuine NES looking game assets. Assets that keep to the limitations of the systems capabilities and colour palettes. In order for me to do this i am creating them using the tools such as NESST and YY-CHR. but sometimes i have a few questions which the software im using doesn't have the answer. I understand the background, but 'metasprites' are a bit of a riddle. I understand the colour rules to some degree and i want to get them right as much as i can, or a least have it where i can be confident that it can be done. <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />The image i showed previously has been scaled, and it wasn't created in any NES software. it was a sprite sheet that was made for another game engine in mind, but using the NES colour pallete in a way that it could be seen as a genuine looking NES game asset, because it had been created as if it was being created for a NES system. Which is something i am doing as well. The assets will of coarse be available in a chr file, or bitmap file, so they could be used for guys like yourself who still develop for the NES system, they may not be your cup of tea, but hey they might help someone here oneday. <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />Which is why i ask the horrible questions, <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /> so i apoligise if some of you feel you may of wasted your time, but i can assure you, your advice is well received.<br /><br />I am a little confused now though? so a sprite is not an 8x8 tile then? i'm sure i read it was, im writing this and i can't qoute now who said what, haha. i feel i have followed what has been posted. Some of you are alarmed by my grid in the image, i suppose you need to ignore that as its not a NES thing. i just wanted to show you how i get the 8x8 sprite tile, use the colours and how id set it up, its not perfect i know, but colour wise is it not doable?<br /><br />i cant send the original unscaled version of my image i posted just yet as its on another computer, i can do it tommorow if you would still like to assist?<br /><br />thanks everyone<br /><br />thank for your responses. <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=8973">Chasersgaming</a> — Tue May 01, 2018 2:26 pm</p><hr />

This is how I would do that character, it does not require complicated overlaying, but it does use up 3 palettes:<br /><br /><img src="https://i.imgur.com/Do9JPkb.png" alt="Image" /><br /><br />- Sprite tiles can be mirrored<br />- As Kasumi pointed out, make the arms 1 pixel shorter to use only one sprite for the legs (position it off grid). This is good because it reduces horizontal tile count, reducing the chance for sprite flickering.<br />- Only the sword is positioned on top of the other sprites<br /><br />You could use 2 palettes instead of 3 if you made the shoes black and then used white instead of brown on the second palette, like so:<br /><img src="https://i.imgur.com/kR5xEjx.png" alt="Image" /><br /><br />This optimization balance is the key to good, varied NES graphics. Make the most of your resources, because they are limited.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=7152">nesrocks</a> — Tue May 01, 2018 12:57 pm</p><hr />

I'm not sure I understand all of your notes. You mention &quot;not sprite mode&quot;, but what's there couldn't be displayed using the background, nor could it be displayed without sprite overlays. The only meaningful difference between the tops and bottoms seems to be the number of palettes used.<br /><br />The top left isn't six sprites as you have it laid out. <br /><br />The top 16x16 area would use four sprites of the palette marked green. This would leave a white area that needs another sprite.<br />The legs would be two more sprites using the palette marked red. <br />An additional sprite is needed to display the white in the top using the palette marked yellow. That's seven.<br /><br />The bottom left wouldn't be six sprites + four sprites. It's be six + three. There's no need to draw or store a sprite that is fully transparent, so it's just the the three sprites as palette 2, and six as palette 1. <br /><br />But you could optimize it further, I'd bet. Can you post it non-scaled?<br /><br />For the top right, it wouldn't take eight sprites, it'd take 5. Two of the green marked palette for the top of the body, one of the yellow palette for the white area, two of the red palette for the feet.<br /><br />For the bottom right, it'd take either 6 or 7. (Hard to tell when the image is scaled.) If you post it unscaled I'll break it down in a few different ways. I think you're still thinking too deeply as this being a grid.<br /><br />Like, from what I can tell, the legs seem to only be eight pixels across, so they only need one sprite.<br />Edit: Well, nevermind on that last point. The one row of pixels at the bottom of the hands forces the leg area to be too wide for one sprite.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3504">Kasumi</a> — Tue May 01, 2018 11:44 am</p><hr />

There are 64 sprites. In any given frame they must all be displayed as 8x8, or they must all be displayed as 8x16. The hardware is 100% unaware of what you'd consider a &quot;character&quot;. Any character can use any number of sprites. But if the total of all the characters currently on screen requires more than 64, the NES couldn't display all of it in the same frame.<br /><br />You've got it right palette-wise. But also realize sprites aren't on a grid like the background. You can put them on any pixel.

The posts above are correct. But just to add a visual, the lower right corner of this image shows how &gt;3 color characters work:<br /><img src="https://i.imgur.com/bFrf20m.gif" alt="Image" /><p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3504">Kasumi</a> — Sat Apr 28, 2018 4:42 pm</p><hr />

Ok I think I get what your saying. Unlike the background loading up 16x16 that uses only four colours in 8x8 tiles from the 16 available background pallete(1 colour in each pallete of 4 being the same. The sprites 8x8 tiles can use 1 pallete of 4 colours from the 16 available colours(1 same colour being used for transparency in each) unless I would use the 8x16 Sprite mode, in which case 2 8x8 tiles next to each other horizontally or vertically would have to use the same 4 colour Pallete?<br /><br />most of or all the NES games I have seen at least would suggest that the 8x16 Sprite mode was used a lot, why is that, PAL systems? Be interesting to know.<br /><br />I appreciate your comments helping and I apoligise if you are find yourselves going over old stuff here. I'm not a nes dev, I'm just amateur pixel artist learning the trade, and trying to create genuine looking nes assets, so I want to get it right as much as i can, so your advice is crucial to my research and learning. <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=8973">Chasersgaming</a> — Sat Apr 28, 2018 3:31 pm</p><hr />
