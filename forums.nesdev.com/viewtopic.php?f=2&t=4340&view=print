I remember reading that the pattern tables must be set up so that both of them are never using pattern table 1. Is this true? Or only partially true? For what reasons should one avoid the scanline counter?

<br />
<br />These rules make it bad because they take from you the freedom to arrange the pattern tables as you'd like and reuse background tiles as sprites (which could be quite useful!). If you don't need any of that you won't find it bad at all.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Also, during your V-Blank code, be sure to perform all VRAM updates BEFORE writing to the IRQ registers (especially $C001).  Otherwise an IRQ may occur sooner than you expect.  Similarly, if you turn off the PPU mid-frame, be advised that the IRQ counter will be adversely affected, so do not reconfigure the counter until after the PPU has been turned back on.
<br />
<br />After the last IRQ of a frame, it is safe to use the upper pattern table for BG and/or the lower pattern table for sprites.  Final Fantasy III takes advantage of this, and I'm sure other games do as well.
<br />
<br />The MMC5's IRQ counter is better because it doesn't require pattern tables to be used in any particular way.  It only needs the PPU to be on to work.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Yeah the others pretty said everything. The MMC3 counter may be better than nothing, but not THAT much better because you have to :
<br />
<br />- Keep the PPU enabled to make it count at all (this is also the case of MMC5's counter)
<br />
<br />- The counter is relative. You can't place the number of the scanline you want the IRQ to happen, you have to place the number of scanline you want to wait. The fastest IRQs you can trigger in a row are 2 scanlines apart, un-elimiating the need for timed code
<br />
<br />- You have to use different pattern table for nametables and sprites (I belive it doesn't matter which is left and which is right - this only changes when in the scanline the IRQ triggers, maybe I'm wrong) else the counter will get additional clocks.
<br />
<br />- Any write to $2005/6 may accidentally clock the counter no matter if they're during rendering, during VBlank or during "forced VBlank". Unless you're absolutely sure A12 will be constant of course.
<br />
<br />The good points of the IRQ counter is that :
<br />- As it's clocked by the PPU and not the CPU, compability between NTSC and PAL consoles is preserved.
<br />- It's better to enable a IRQ than do stupid polling

<br />What exactly are you trying to do? Use more than 256 BG tiles? Have a dixed Status bar at the top or bottom of the screen?

<br />
<br />What you want to do I think will require precise timed code for leaving the screen off for 40 lines or a CPU cycle based IRQ. You could then use the IRQ for turning the screen off early though. 
<br />
<br />There's nothing crazy about changing CHR-RAM tiles as long as you aren't trying CHR-ROM size banking mid-frame. ;p

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />A CPU cycle based IRQ? This may sound weird that I don't know about this by now, but is that like an interrupt that counts cycles? If so, that would definitely be the way I'd go! I haven't dealt much with IRQ's in my days of NESdeving; I've only made simple games that don't require anything special like that. Is there anywhere that I could find more info about this?
<br />
<br />And yeah, tepples pretty much got it. Once I optimize the polygon drawing code a little and program it to change frames, I will have proof that it is possible to have polygonal intro movies in games without using illegal opcodes or over 16k of PRG space. Though it requires 5k of SRAM and CHR RAM. I admit, this isn't something where you'd say "Only 5k of SRAM" because 5k is A LOT. Luckily, my ChateauLeVania game holds 3 save files in under 3k of SRAM.
<br />
<br />EDIT: And yeah, there's no way I'm planning on updating a whole CHR RAM bank in a frame. THAT would be crazy  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /> .

If I could detect a hit at 40 pixels from the bottom, I could just turn the screen off, and then do some PPU updating until it wraps around and 40 scanlines are drawn from the top of the screen (+ 22 for Vblank) to turn it back on.
