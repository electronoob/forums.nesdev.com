		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Hello everyone!
<br />
<br />I'm new here, and I'm developing a NES emulator as a personal project/for fun.
<br />
<br />It's getting to be quite accurate, but now I've hit a snag that I can't seem to overcome by myself.
<br />
<br />No matter what I try, I can't pass the cpu_interrupts_v2 test #4. (IRQ and Sprite DMA test). It's always off by one instruction at some point.
<br />
<br />I've tried fiddling with both Sprite DMA and frame IRQ timings, but to no avail.
<br />
<br />So, how many CPU cycles do frame irq/sprite dma take?
<br />
<br />- For frame IRQ, I'm counting 29833 cycles if $4017 is set to $00 at an even cycle, and 29834 if it's set at an odd cycle;
<br />- For sprite DMA, I'm counting (after the initial 4 STA cycles), 514 cycles if $4014 is written at an even cycle, or 513 if $4014 is written at an odd cycle. If the IRQ triggers during sprite DMA, I delay it by one instruction;
<br />
<br />Is this correct? I've tried many things to no avail, it always fails somewhere, so I must be doing something wrong.
<br />
<br />With the timings I described above, this is the result I get:
<br />

<br />
<br />Thanks in advance for all the help!

<br />
<br />I now (finally) pass the IRQ tests, after a very puzzling week!
<br />
<br />I hope the timings are trully correct, though <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /> If anyone can confirm the timing values I wrote in the previous post, I would be very thankful!

<br />
<br />Do you use timestamp in your emulator?

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Yes, I precalculate the CPU cycle at which the irq should happen, and then compare it with the current cycle. Seems to be working fine now, incidentally I now also pass the apu even/odd jitter test, which I wasn't passing before.
<br />
<br /><strong>EDIT: </strong> When dealing with frame irqs, after you write to $4017 and the counter reaches 0, it is reset. But in that case, for how many clocks does the CPU run before the next irq? Specifically, should I count the extra even/odd cycle when the counter resets after the irq?
<br />
<br />Thanks!

<br />EDIT: quote from my notes...
<br />
<br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">      When writing to $4017, the frame counter reset <br />        and the quarter/half frame triggers happen simultaneously,<br />        but only on "odd" cycles (and only after the first "even" cycle<br />        after the write occurs) - thus, it happens either 2 or 3 cycles<br />        after the write (i.e. on the 2nd or 3rd cycle of the next instruction).<br />        <br />        After 2 or 3 clock cycles (depending on when the write is performed),<br />        the timer is reset.<br /><br />        If the mode flag is set, then both "quarter frame" and "half frame"<br />        signals are also generated. </div>

<br />
<br />I'm now struggling with the last test, which is barely working at all (it either hangs or displays completely bogus values), so this is still a work in progress.
<br />
<br /><strong>Edit: </strong> After a whole lot of work, I'm passing all five tests. I'm not sure I'm correctly implementing the delay between APU frame IRQs when $4017 isn't written to, though.
