I see your point. 4x4 pixels are awfully big, and for details/small things, they are undesirable. Though for sprites, if you make them part of the BG, your graphics will look a lot like Atari 2600 graphics with very wide pixels. Let's see some pros/cons of working with BG/sprites.<br /><br />BG Pros:<br /><br />-Anything made of 4 colors and 8x2 pixels can be displayed. ANY.<br />-No size limits (besides 1 pixel for being as small as possible)<br /><br />BG Cons:<br /><br />-8x2 pixels on enemies/objects are very Atari 2600 seeming, maybe worse.<br />-Only 4 colors<br />-More time consumed computing final image, layering enemy graphics over the raycasted walls<br /><br />Sprite Pros:<br /><br />-Enemies can be placed anywhere on screen<br />-Pixel size is not an issue, necessarily<br />-Drawing sprites is easy compared to doing it with BG<br /><br />Sprite Cons:<br /><br />-Could be very hard to stay within the 64 sprite limit<br />-Could be very hard to stay within the 8 sprites per scanline limit<br />-Possibly hard to have all sizes and combinations predefined in 2BPP CHR format without eating too much space<br />-If there are too many predefinitions graphically, one might consider using CHR RAM, in which case, VRAM updates would be horribly time consuming<br /><br />I think if you can't stand the way 8x2 pixel enemies look, you'll have to stick with sprites, it seems. It might be possible to do a combination of the two, and use sprite layering over the BG for 8x2 pixel sprites. Though you'd have to be clever as to not ever go beyond sprite scanline/page limits. Then there's always flickering, so you can display one enemy, then another, then another, etc. cycling through them all. I think it wouldn't be SO hard to make sure an enemy stays within 64 sprites. You might have to make them 8x16, as well as reduce their size.<br /><br />And enemies don't necessarily have to take up the entire screen if they're as close as possible. I would suggest, if you haven't, seeing how large you can make an enemy with 64 sprites. If you can make it so it looks pretty close, then that's good. You can then use the cycling method, or at least consider it. Otherwise, I'm not quite sure what to tell you... Perhaps the sprite+BG thing, but that could look weird...<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=138">Celius</a> — Thu Aug 27, 2009 12:54 am</p><hr />

So the enemies/objects would share the same colors as the walls, which would look pretty dull and wouldn't stand out much. You may have seen some previous tests of mine that used 4x4 pixels. I gave up on that idea mostly because of the following reasons:<br /><br />1. 4 colors for everything is too little, the levels were too dull, they lacked "life";<br />2. the poor vertical resolution made distant walls too indistinguishable;<br />3. too many rays had to be cast because of the horizontal resolution, it would be almost twice as slow;<br /><br />I know, 8x2 pixels have a great impact on the horizontal resolution and can fuck up the texturing of distant walls, but I still get a better sense of 3D then I did with 4x4. Considering that I can also have more wall colors and faster rendering, it wasn't hard to decide in favor of the new pixel size.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=95">tokumaru</a> — Wed Aug 26, 2009 3:58 pm</p><hr />

I'm not really sure about how to handle sprites yet though. If I use 8x8 I'll not be able to draw much, if I use 8x16 I won't be able to pre-render them with all possible patterns. I might end up making a few reusable parts (as opposed to every possible pattern) that objects are required to be built from which will be available in different sizes.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=95">tokumaru</a> — Wed Aug 26, 2009 9:13 am</p><hr />

Hey guys. Here is a <a href="http://www.nesstuff.kit.net/raynes.swf" class="postlink">flash prototype</a> of the raycaster I've been planning for a while (there is no collision detection, so try not to go outside of the map). The NES can surely do this, the only question is how fast...<br /><br />In this prototype I'm using the same fixed-point precision and texture scaling as I would on the NES, so a ROM would look exactly like that. With some tricks I was able to reduce all coordinates to 16 bits (as opposed to the previous 24), but the maximum map size is 64x64 blocks (the prototype map is 16x16), although it should be possible to have map transitions or different floors in a real game to have larger levels.<br /><br />I also simplified the texture scaling to use only 8-bit integer calculations, so it should be pretty fast now. Drawing larger walls is slower, but since finding them is faster (because they are closer the ray doesn't extend much) there shouldn't be much difference compared to smaller walls (which are faster to draw but slower to find).<br /><br />Anyway, I think this looks interesting for the NES, even though the textures look pretty mangled when seen from a distance. Do you think it is too ugly or is there any interest in seeing this on the NES?
