<br />Unless I've misunderstood what this program does I don't see how the player would do that. An nsf contains the code/data to play the music, so what you'd need is a cart with either of those sound expansion chips you mentioned.

<br />An older version of Nintendulator emulated this behaviour to some extent. That was the only way that I could duplicate this issue. The NSF should be debugged, then carefully remove any illegal reads and writes.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Loopy, thanks for the NSF player.  I tried this on my Famicom, and there are various graphical glitches running up/down the screen while the NSF plays.  That's no problem, though.  What is a problem is that all NSF songs play too fast, something like 120%-150% too fast compared to regular 60hz timing.  Any idea why this is?
<br />
<br />Also, both on this and the FDS mapper, do you think it would be possible for you to add button detection not only for bit 0 of 4016, but bit 1 as well (the extra controller port on the Famicom)?  I play most games using a rapid-fire controller hooked up to this port, and it's a little annoying having to drop that controller (PowerPak menu ROM recognizes the expansion controller) to change NSF songs, or to "insert" an FDS disk.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Hmm... curious.  My player gets its timing from 2 things. First it detects if it's a PAL or NTSC system, and from that chooses either the PAL or NTSC speed in the NSF header (using default values if those are nulled out).  It also uses a 1MHz timer, derived from a 20MHz clock in the PowerPak, to count time during playback.
<br />
<br />If the PAL detect code is bad, it should make playing slower, not faster.  Maybe the clock in your powerpak is not the same speed as mine? That seems unlikely.  I may need to have you help me with debugging.
<br />
<br />Hm... on second thought, the PAL/NTSC handling should be changed now. That was written back when I was using M2 for the timer. I'll change the controller reading code to look at both bits.

<br />
<br />It seems like an easy idea to dismiss, but I think I see a way to do it.  Obviously it needs the sound logic, but then it also needs to be able to feed the sound output to the NES.  If the NES can read from the mapper (can't it?), it could pick it up digital samples on data bus and write it to $4011, all timed by an IRQ.  Personally I think it's a brilliant idea, that's what I do on Squeedo and it sounds incredible (except for the aliasing at high-freqs, no big loss in my case).
<br />
<br />However, forget about VRC7.  It's complicated.  Namco106, I'm not sure about either, the wavetable memory might eat up a good amount of resources.  That leaves VRC6 and FME-7 as being the "easy" ones.
<br />
<br />I'm just speculating here, I don't have a PowerPak yet, nor have I made anything signficant with programmable logic.

<br />
<br />Okay, i had the wrong mapper set.. I got 1.20
<br />
<br />then added the mappers given in the new nsf player release.
<br />
<br />however, i no longer get the extra audio channels from VRC6, and do not get the FDS either.. i had done the audio mod and had VRC6 working perfectly before, now its silent.. 
<br />
<br />anyone else have this problem?
<br />
<br />***  EDIT ***
<br />
<br />issue resolved on its own, inexplicably, while loopy was helping my troubleshoot it.
<br />
<br />Thanks to the spirits that left my nes.

<br />
<br />But on a longer term, it might be better to make a separate NSF mapper for each hardware. The only ones that would cry about this are the 2A03 sillies who love making songs using every damn expansion chip ever made. ;)

<br />Even sillier is making an NSF and a GBS to run at the same time. But some of my S3M chiptunes actually sound like that.
