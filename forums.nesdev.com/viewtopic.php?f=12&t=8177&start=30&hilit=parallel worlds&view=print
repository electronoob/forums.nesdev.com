The swapped binary shouldn't work in the emulator because you've scrambled the data.  Other than that, it sounds like you've done everything right.  Maybe the ROMs are in the wrong sockets?

Patch your file and confirm working in emulator<br />2. Strip header (if needed) using swap bin<br />3. Use Lunar Expand to make it 16mb (2MB) <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://fusoya.eludevisibility.org/le/">http://fusoya.eludevisibility.org/le/</a><!-- m --><br />4. Use swap bin to swap bin the file<br />5. Burn the files to eproms<br />6. Solder said eproms to your donor board accordingly<br /><br /><br /> I haven't done one of these in quite awhile so I forget which eprom goes where.

This is the only place I found where I could possibly get some answers to what's going on with the Zelda <span class="posthilit">Parallel</span> World cart I made. I hope someone can help me out here.<br /><br />I tested the rom in snes9x, found no title issues there, and successfully burned the two eproms. I got everything soldered in and the game boots up showing &quot;Euclid Presents&quot; followed by music playing and just a blank screen. <br /><br />Does anyone know what I could have possibly did wrong? I couldn't find information on which rom should be place where. I assumed the bin 1 rom would be closer to the pins to connect to the system, maybe I am wrong?<br /><br />Any help would be much appreciated. Thanks.

Actually I just about to go to bed and figured let me try it again. It worked, went to the title screen and I was able to create a profile. However, when I went to enter the game it crashed to blank screen. I rebooted and the profile was gone, although that may not matter because I did not replace the battery yet.<br /><br />Edit: Ok, again I just tried it and now it went past and started the game. I am going to leave it alone for tonight and try it out again tomorrow. I don't know what could be causing this? Is this unusual?

Thanks, still semi novice to soldering and never did eprom's before.
