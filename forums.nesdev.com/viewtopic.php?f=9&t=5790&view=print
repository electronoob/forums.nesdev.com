		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I'm tired of my parallel port Willem. Getting it to work was never really easy, and it simply doesn't work with the parallel ports of my current computers. In fact I'll probably replace my main PC sometime soon, and most new motherboards don't even have parallel ports anymore.
<br />
<br />Anyway, I was hoping that some of you had good experiences with USB programmers, and are willing recommend one. If you can point me to online stores that sell them, even better. Oh, and there is no way I can't afford those reeeeally expensive ones (several hundred bucks).
<br />
<br />Thanks!

<br />
<br />I don't have any particular one to recommend, but it definitely does get expensive if you want a real universal one for programming the more esoteric parts, then considering adapters and such..
<br />
<br />Almost anything will do for EPROMs and 5V Flash chips.
<br />
<br />A while back I was looking at the ones on ebay branded "Top".  If they've got good software they'd be decent.  But unless my Willem dies, I see no need.

<br />
<br />They have some nice looking USB Programmers. I've bought a PIC programmer from them before which worked fine. If I ever buy another EPROM programmer (I bought a cheap chinese parallel port Willem clone like you probably did, it sucks) it'll probably be from them and one of the nice USB ones like this one: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.mcumall.com/comersus/store/comersus_viewItem.asp?idProduct=4282">http://www.mcumall.com/comersus/store/c ... oduct=4282</a><!-- m -->
<br />
<br />If you need to program 16bit chips with more than 40 pins you can get an adapter but all the NES sized chips should be no problem. I've never used one of these though so all I can say it they look nice and for just over $100 it's not bad.

<br />Ah, this is the kind of thing I'm looking for. It's not cheap, but not expensive either, and is much better than the one I have. I should have gone for one of these the first time, too bad I decided to get the cheap Willem.

If you want a burner that isn't a POS your gonna shell out a couple hundred bucks at least. In the case of chip burners you get what you pay for simple as that. I learned this the hard way buying these low quality junk programmers when I was a noob. Take my advise, it's better to save up your money and get something nice that is gonna last more than 6 months or for that matter work at all cause the failure rate of these low end burners is quite high, even right out of the box. I would put Willem on par with an Xbox 360 for reliability...lol..

<br />Are you saying Willem will exchange the programmer for free within 3 years if it dies? That's how long Microsoft warrants that an Xbox 360 won't RROD.

<br />I wouldn't recommend it as "good", but my ~$60 TOP2004 has been running fine for at least 4 years now.  Sure the software is a translated mess however it has programmed thousands (yes literally) of chips with no problems.

<br />
<br />Really? I had a Top2004 and it burned out within 6 months. I probably got to program about 500 to 600 chips before it crapped out. Also just try to program anything needing 21 or 25vpp with that POS. It's so hit and miss it's a joke. 2716,2732 or 2532's program about once in every 5 burn attempts. The first one I got was so bad I sent it back for a replacement. The replacement one was able to do high voltage programming for about a couple months and then I was stuck with it able to program CMOS chips of 8k to 512k max. Anything under or over would just fail. It was not soon after that it died completely. Customer service from those jokers is a real treat too.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I ended up buying a WELLON VP-280 yesterday. Does anyone know if by any chance that's a better brand than WILLEM (what's up with the similar names anyway?)?
<br />
<br />I almost got the TOP2004 but after reading some bad reviews I went with the WELLON. It was more expensive (so I expect it to be better), and certainly more expensive than if I had bought it from an international store, but considering the import taxes and shipping I guess it paid off to buy from a local store. Plus, the thing will probably be here tomorrow, instead of taking a month+ to arrive (if it even arrived, I've been having bad luck with international shipping, I haven't received the last 2 things I was supposed to).
<br />
<br />The software appears to be in eng<strong>r</strong>ish as well (I guess this will be the case with every chinese programmer). Although the store said they have it in portuguese, and even though I don't usually use software in portuguese I guess I will if it's better translated than the eng<strong>r</strong>ish version.
<br />
<br />Anyway, I'm just checking if anyone has had any experience with WELLON programmers.
