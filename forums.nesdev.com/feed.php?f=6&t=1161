I got the Zophar's Domain collection using GetRight's browser. The snesmusic.org set could be a bit harder, as last time I checked, it was extremely biased against downloading all of the files at once.<br /><br />On the other hand, the Zophar collection is 105MB in size, in RAR format, while the sets I have from an older SNESMusic.org are about 60MB in size, so I can completely understand someone not wanting people to blatantly grab all the files without thinking about it. I'd reccomend that if you're such a serious SNES music fan, you just start clicking those links, or find something to click for you. I've been listening to the entire collection on and off, and keeping track of what I liked out of it, so I may have a huge text of my own favorites in about 4 years, when I get done.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=229">ugetab</a> — Tue Jun 27, 2006 6:58 am</p><hr />

Goo morning all,<br /><br />I'm really impassioned with NES and SNES music, and I found two exciting archives of NSF files (nsf_pack.rar and the Akumu archive).<br /><br />Sorry if I'm not on the right thread, but I'm looking for the same kind of big archive for SNES music... I've found that an RSN file was in fact a RAR file that contains each track of a game, and I wondered if you knew a place where I could download such a "big RSN archive"...<br /><br />Manually downloading an RSN file for each game will be very long  <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt=":roll:" title="Rolling Eyes" /> <br /><br />Thank you so much,<br />Geoffrey<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=743">gdawirs</a> — Tue Jun 27, 2006 4:14 am</p><hr />

Great work with the GBS page. I don't think the two Lufia III rips are significantly different enough to put them both on. All mine does is start off at a different place, so that the first track in the rip is the first track in-game (the other tracks aren't in order). Since Caitsith2 ripped it before I did, and mine doesn't add anything significant, I'd just leave his rip up instead of both.<br /><br />I have a GBR rip of Wizardry Gaiden 1 - Suffering of the Queen. I have no idea where I got from, but here it is: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://h1.ripway.com/kingshriek/WizardryGaiden1-SufferingoftheQueen.zip">http://h1.ripway.com/kingshriek/Wizardr ... eQueen.zip</a><!-- m --><br /><br />I get the feeling there's a large amount of GBR rips somewhere out there. In the source code of NEZplug+, I saw references to GBR rips of Last Bible 1&amp;2, Tekkaman Blade (with some hack to make the rip work), and some other titles. Really makes me wonder how much I've duplicated.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=190">kingshriek</a> — Fri Mar 03, 2006 4:13 am</p><hr />

I've finished the GBS page, url is above. Replace .html with .7z to get whole archive pack (about 3 MB) - though I wouldn't recommend it - it's still in beta stage.<br />Also, if any of you have GBS files not listed there, or want to provide corrections for the unknown fields (only verified information, not something like 'd00d, Super Mario Land is done by Koji Kondo because he's the only Nintendo composer', please contact me.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">LocalH wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"><br />First, you might look at the <a href="http://hvsc.c64.org" class="postlink">High Voltage SID Collection</a>. In my opinion, this is the type of archive that we should shoot for - it contains game music, covers, originals, and is basically an attempt at containing <strong>all</strong> C64 songs in one archive.<br /></div><br /><br />Not really. They are not touching Compute Gazette files with a ten foot pole. And that's almost 10000 songs (mostly pure crap but still).<br />But yeah, I was thinking along the lines of HVSC. Only without the author directory sorting. That wouldn't work well here, as 70% of the files don't have composer credit, and there aren't that much rips, so normal a-z directories should work well.<br /><br />I've been also thinking about the 26 character filename limits.<br />Currently the files are named like this:<br />Lufia - The Legend Returns (2001)(Natsume)(rip Kingshriek).gbs<br />(rip field only when there are repeated files to differentiate between them). That does exceed 26 chars by a lot. Still, most of this info could be relocated to external text datafile (STIL if you want).<br />Your thoughts?<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">LocalH wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"><br />Plus, the HVSC includes the SID Tune Information List (or STIL), which holds information about individual tunes (for example, if a song is a cover of an existing song, STIL is the place to find that out - also, STIL holds comments made about the tunes by their authors).<br /></div><br /><br />Yes, I'd like to have something like that. Especially given that info fields in NSF/GBS are pretty small, and GBR/HES/KSS files don't have any at all.<br />Thing is - no player will support it (not that many players support GBS info fields - Hoot is the only one I know of), so it will have pure trivia value for now.<br />Though I've talked with a friend, and he's saying that adding STIL/SLDB support to NEZPlug/NSFPlug isn't out of the question.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">LocalH wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"><br />Updates are also handled quite well in the HVSC, and it's possible that the HVSC Update program could be adapted to work with NSF or GBS files.<br /></div><br /><br />Yeah, I was thinking about that too. Not that there's much happening on the ripping front lately (not counting Kingshriek, who amounts to almost half of my rips).<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">NewRisingSun wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"><br />Please don't. The idea to lump together actual video game music with covers and original stuff is a bad one; Leave the non-game stuff to the folks at 2a03.org.<br /></div><br /><br />Well, they haven't updated the archive in what, a year? Not exactly active, are they? The MCK 2chn thread alone has released about 600 new NSF files since then.<br />But yeah, I've talked about this earlier, and I will concentrate rather on the game part. Unless someone at 2a03.org would like to join force.<br />Other formats are pretty much game only. Well, there are some demo/pd GBS, but they are made by Manfred Linzer (Shin'en demos) and Jake Kaufman (Drymouth), who both made game music on Gameboy. So those aren't really that farfetched.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">NewRisingSun wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"><br />The idea to get every single piece of music for one particular format in one zip file is inconvenient to people who just want one particular game music; they don't want to download a 50 MB archive full of remixes and crap. It also panders to the ROM kiddies who always want a "complete set" of everything.<br /></div><br /><br />Call me a ROM kiddie, but I would like to have a "complete set" of music rips. Also, you haven't obviously looked into the way HVSC distributes it's packs. <br />There is one big pack for new people, update files for those that gotten the big pack earlier, and a few mirrors which have the collection upacked for people like you, who just want to get a few files they didn't have earlier.<br />I've been thinking of something along this (maybe put a torrent with the big pack, though with sizes like 3 MB there's no real need IMO).<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">NewRisingSun wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"><br />Oh, and the one-archive solution already exists in the form of Kevin Horton's NSF collection.<br /></div><br /><br />Which has been last updated when exactly? And more importantly, which has been offline for how long exactly?<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=295">Knurek</a> — Fri Mar 03, 2006 2:54 am</p><hr />

In my opinion, this is the type of archive that we should shoot for - it contains game music, covers, originals, and is basically an attempt at containing all C64 songs in one archive.<br /></div>Please don't. The idea to lump together actual video game music with covers and original stuff is a bad one; I for example am not interested at all in non-game music, and I imagine that there are several others like me. Leave the non-game stuff to the folks at 2a03.org. <br />The idea to get every single piece of music for one particular format in one zip file is inconvenient to people who just want one particular game music; they don't want to download a 50 MB archive full of remixes and crap. It also panders to the ROM kiddies who always want a "complete set" of everything. Oh, and the one-archive solution already exists in the form of Kevin Horton's NSF collection.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=133">NewRisingSun</a> — Thu Mar 02, 2006 7:21 pm</p><hr />
