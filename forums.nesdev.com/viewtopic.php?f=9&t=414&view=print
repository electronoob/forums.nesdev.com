		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />First, a message to Kevin Horton: I'll pay a decent amount for a CopyNES, so get selling them ASAP!
<br />
<br />Now, a question: Does CopyNES allow to take .NES files from your PC and write them to a cart?  It says that it "allows reading and writing of cartridges" on the nesdev homepage, but I read the entire CopyNES site (understood about 80% of it), and it doesn't seem like it supports this.  So does it allow to write to carts or not?
<br />
<br />Thank you in advance for answering my question.

<br />
<br />The short answer is yes, it can write to carts.  Replace the ROMs with RAMs, and rewire as appropriate.
<br />
<br />The long answer probably seems nuanced, if you're not too familiar with NES cart hardware.  But writing to the cart's ROM is the same way that 99% of the various cart mappers are controlled.  So .NES files larger than 40kB will need further modifications done to it's cart to be able to load it.
<br />
<br />And for games that use CHR-ROM, it may need a pin added to the connector (notice that most carts have missing pins, one is needed for CHR-RAM).

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Okay, well I'm pretty new to this.  However, I am still willing to fiddle with cartridges for hours on end to make the necessary modifications to get the games working on NES.
<br />
<br />So for .nes files 40 kb and under, you don't need to make modifications to the cartridge?  But for .nes files larger than 40 kb, you'll need to rewire some things, and possible make other modifications?  Is this correct?

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />For any of the carts, you have to remove the ROMs and replace them with SRAM chips.  So even on the 40kB carts there's some rewiring needed too, but it's nothing major.  The harder part would removing the original ROMs (unless you have good desoldering tools).

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I don't know what most people use for desoldering, but Radio Shack sells a desoldering iron cheap (~$10) and it works killer on IC's, not only does the IC come out in great shape, but it also leaves the via's nice and clean, so if you want to put in a socket, it's pretty painless.
<br />
<br />I've never had much luck with other desoldering tools, like desoldering braid (yuck), or the "vacuum pencil" type deal, which works ok for some things.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Desoldering is easy (Assuming you don't need the onboard NES ROM). Just use needle-nose pliers to clip the pins of the NES mask ROM of  the PCB. Once you've clipped/cut all the pins, you can pull the rom right off. The pins are still soldered to the board. You can get these out with a simple pump desoldering iron or a needle/pen-point soldering iron. Hope this helps.

Is it very complicated and dumb to use copynes? or is it just like write chr data here, and right prg data here, or what? and how are you supposed to know what chips to cut and resolder? and one other question. What is that drill bit that you're supposed to use to open NES carts up? I'm sorry, I'm very new to this. Any documentation for newbies on this sort of thing?

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />A CopyNES does not even require opening up a cartridge at all (provided you know what mapper it uses; otherwise, you need to open it up and look at it to figure out), nor does it require cutting or resoldering ANY chips (except for actually BUILDING the CopyNES, which you probably shouldn't attempt unless you know EXACTLY what you're doing). All you do is plug the cartridge into the CopyNES (which is just a modified frontloading NES), type in a few commands on your PC (which is connected to the CopyNES via parallel port cable), and it dumps the cartridge.
<br />
<br />Dumping a cartridge with a new mapper is totally different, though, as it requires writing a plugin (in 6502 assembly) to manipulate the mapper on the cartridge and dump the PRG/CHR data.

If so, then that is like the best thing ever made. Okay, not quite, but it still is. Could you erase the data from mario 1, and rewrite to that cart, because it uses mapper 0?

<br />
<br />Seriously though, read everything linked off the main NESdev site, and everything on Kevin Horton's page (beware, he makes mistakes too, the cpu pinout in nestuff is wrong, as are some of the mapper descriptions).  One unfortunate thing: If there is conflicting information, both documents are probably wrong (but trust the newer one over the older one)...  A lot of older NES documentation is either difficult to understand, inaccurate or downright wrong (cf. controller 'signatures', famicom not having DMPC, etc...)
<br />
<br />If you don't know anything about hardware, you should start off simpler, and work your way up to hardware for the NES.  There are lots of tutorials and websites about logic, computer architecture, etc...  Build a 555 timer or get a PIC+programmer and make a LED flash, and go from there.

<br />
<br />The hardware docs that are around now generally assume one knows exactly what they're doing already.  But it's good reference material once you know the context.
