I guess what Jungle Book does is much closer to the "traditional" solution where the status bar is uploaded dynamically.<br />I'm not sure how it does "stacking", but as new information can be written to the status bar basically anytime, it has to either :<br />- Write a whole status bar when it's needed (takes most non-extended VBlank time typically, I did it that way in my game)<br />- Do it as tokumaru mentions, one line at a time, but then if new information is updated it has to be updated in both copies of the status bar. Probably a little more complex to code but saves some potentially precious VBlank time.<br /><br />The stacking technique is nothing new, variants of it are used in all 3 Double Dragon games, Raida Senki, Conquest of the Crystal Palace, Gradius II, Parodius, etc...<br /><br />What is so special about Jungle Book is that it does it with vertical mirroring, while all the games I mentioned do it with horizontal mirroring. This is possible because the status bar is small, and a significant area is unused/forced blanked (I guess via blank character banks but could also be done with $2001) on the top and bottom on the screen. That was it's possible to have all displayed tiles + 2 times the status bar total to 30 tiles.<br /><br />For example if the status bar is 4 tiles, there remains exactly 22 tiles for display, but because you don't want artifacts that makes 21 actually usable tiles. So for a reult this allows you to disaply 21 playfield tiles, 4 status bar tiles, and you have to force-blank 5 tiles on the top and bottom (including both ovescan ones), which is significant but reasonable.<br /><br />If you wanted a larger status bar, for example 6 tiles, you'd have to reserve 12 tiles just for that in the nametable, so only 18 (in practice 17) tiles for display. With 17 tiles to show and 6 for the status bar, this makes 23 used tiles and you'd have to force-blank 7 tiles, which would be a really HUGE part of the screen, likely you'd give up this method and use another one which allows you not to waste so much playfield.<br /><br />I find the first method used by thefox very interesting, because it's the first time I see it. I personally already have considered the theorcal possibility of it, but through it would never be feasible because of how much updates are needed.<br /><br />Here the only reason parts of the screen are forced-blanked is to be able to do really heavy VRAM updates. I wonder if there would be a way to work arround this (and so make this method be better than the Jungle Book one) in some situations.<br />For example if the scrolling speeds are always low such as in a RPG, you could know exactly when the screen will cross a 8-pixel boundary and when the status bar will have to be entierely rewritten to VRAM.<br />If you do it in a nice unrolled loop, this could fit exactly the remaining VBlank time after Sprite-DMA, so that if no updates are ever needed on those particular frames, your game will work fine without having to use any type of forced blanking.<br />Basically it means you have to do the scrolling updates just one frame before you update the status bar but it sounds really feasible. In fact it's already what thefox's 2nd demo already does !<br /><br />Eventually there is the technique used in "Krusty's Fun House" which should be considered as well... You have no need for extra blanking, no limit in scrolling speed nor status bar size, and can scroll without color artefacts... but you need TWO splitpoints per frame, one for the status bar and another variable one to handle "overflows" in the playfield (i.e. when the status bar is about to be displayed it forces it to show the next row of the playfield).<br />This method also only works for a constant sized status bar.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=38">Bregalad</a> — Sat Jul 09, 2011 9:50 am</p><hr />

I traced through this in Nintendulator's debugger. The NMI handler appears to do the following:<br /><ol style="list-style-type: decimal"><li>Set the background color to black. </li><li>DMA-copy the display list to OAM. </li><li>Wait for the end of vertical blanking. The demo uses timed code, but something else could use the sprite 0 hit flag (which turns off during the pre-render line). </li><li>With the screen still force-blanked, copy the status bar into VRAM just below the seam with an unrolled loop. This could be fully unrolled as in the demo or partially unrolled as in something else. You have about 16 lines to finish this. </li><li>Set the scroll position to the top of the status bar. </li><li>Wait for the bottom of the status bar. The demo uses timed code, but something else could use sprite 0. </li><li>Change the background color and scroll position to the playfield. </li></ol><br />The demo is structured to run entirely in NMI (a so-called "superloop" like SMB1). This has the advantage of reducing NMI timing jitter from 7 to 3 cycles. The occasional writes to $4040 must be some debug timer on a mapper, I guess.<br /><br />Because the status bar is updated every frame, the nametable data must always be stored literally in RAM, unlike the traditional solution where it can get constructed dynamically and use one of the transfer slots.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=9">tepples</a> — Fri Jul 08, 2011 8:37 pm</p><hr />

Pretty cool. I guess this is a perfectly valid way to have a status bar and free scrolling. And in the process you even get rid of scrolling artifacts.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=95">tokumaru</a> — Thu Jul 07, 2011 2:16 pm</p><hr />

At that point you might need to blank a few more scanlines, in order to avoid vertical scrolling glitches.
