You can even use GCC as your compiler.</div>Having both the MD and <span class="posthilit">SNES</span> docs, yes, I can say the MD is much easier to program, and here I'm assuming that both would be programmed using assembly.
<br />
<br />For starters, the 68000 has 15 general use 32-bit registers, and almost all operations can be performed with 32-bit values. As far as I know, the 65816 doesn't do very well on that area, which means that the 68000 has a huge advantage when it comes to processing large values (although I believe the 65816 still may beat it at 8-bit data, but I'm unsure how many cycles does it eat up for each instruction so I can't comment). The few operations that can't be done as 32-bit on the 68000 are those that you'd want to avoid anyways since they're slow (e.g. multiplication and division, and even then, those deal with larger values than what the <span class="posthilit">SNES</span> was provided).
<br />
<br />Then there's the VDP. Yes, it may not have four tilemap layers or scan-<span class="posthilit">line</span> deformation (mode 7 on the <span class="posthilit">SNES</span>), but all the features it has can be turned on simultaneously. If you want, you can have it to use 320×224*, horizontal scroll per <span class="posthilit">line</span>, <span class="posthilit">vertical</span> scroll per 2 tiles, 8KB tilemaps, window plane, shadow/highlight and interlaced mode all together (on the <span class="posthilit">SNES</span>, what features are availble depend on which mode you're using). Also, if you try to write outside blank, the write will still make its way into memory (albeit it'll be slower). If you saturate the VDP, it'll stall the 68000 until it's free to accept new commands. All 2048 tiles can be used for anything (no dedicated areas for sprites and such, use them the way you want!). Also, the MSB of the horizontal sprite coordinate isn't given in a separate bit in a separate table =P
<br />
<br />The Z80 has only 8KB of RAM, so at first it may seem like in a much worse situation than the SPC700. However, it's also able to read all of the ROM on its own, so those 8KB of RAM generally are left for the program and its variables, and the sound data is read straight off the ROM (where it has much more room to breathe). The SPC700 needs to put in its 64KB the program, its variables, music data, SFX data, and also the samples. And the only way it can communicate to the exterior is through four ports and hope the 65816 is paying attention to them.
<br />
<br />And finally, reading joypads isn't tied to VBlank. Like, seriously, WTF? Why does the program have to wait until a bit after VBlank to read the joypads on the <span class="posthilit">SNES</span>? o_O (and before you mention things like lightguns, on the MD the peripherals can generate an interrupt so that isn't an issue)
<br />
<br />It feels stupid talking about this on a <span class="posthilit">SNES</span> development board, but the topic arised. I guess somebody here can do the exact opposite and talk about things the <span class="posthilit">SNES</span> does easier than the MD. Let's be fair though, Sega decided to go easy when it comes to programming the hardware. Yes, there are the add-ons which are harder to program, but what did you expect, that's like trying to run a game using hardware from two/three separate consoles at the same time =P
<br />
<br /><em>*Technically, with interlaced mode it becomes 320×448, but you get my point.</em>

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Also the fact that the MD doesn't have a CIC. There is some layer of security, yes, but it's pathetically easy to defeat. Just have "SEGA" at $000100 (where the header starts) and write "SEGA" to $A14000 in your code. There isn't even any need for proper timing, you just have to do it before accessing the VDP. This is probably the main factor here, actually, since it made flashcarts much easier back then.
<br />
<br />There are more things (e.g. the 68000 can access the sound hardware directly) but I guess the topic is derailed. I didn't expect this discussion appearing on a board like this o_O

<br />The only MD game really meant to be like that was Virtua Racing (it uses the SVP). The 32x was Sega's stupid attempt at tackling into the 32-bit generation (when they already had the Saturn for that!), and the Sega CD was made to compete against the PC Engine's CD add-on.
<br />
<br />Also, Nintendo almost makes the same mistake (remember, the <span class="posthilit">SNES</span> CD add-on), and for the record, that ended up in a worse mistake (Sony decided to keep going on its own and then they released the PlayStation and took both Sega and Nintendo by surprise).
<br />
<br />EDIT: how the checkerboard pattern in Project MD works:
<br /><a href="http://img175.imageshack.us/img175/7354/rhomget.gif" class="postlink">Normal speed</a>
<br /><a href="http://img231.imageshack.us/img231/7354/rhomget.gif" class="postlink">Slow motion</a>
<br />
<br />Granted, it looks much better when used for gradients (like it would be <a href="http://srb2town.sepwich.com/junk/projmd017.PNG" class="postlink">here</a>), but that level was a palette whore because the mirroring ate up 50% of the color...

<br />A bunch of 6-bit LCDs use the same trick (temporal Bayer dithering) to display 8-bit images.

<br />
<br />Although if we're going to continue on the topic of features, the VDP's interlaced mode affects everything (tilemaps, sprites, scrolling), while on the <span class="posthilit">SNES</span> it only affects the tilemaps. Interlaced mode is completely useless anyways because the horizontal resolution isn't affected, so you end up with 256/320×448. Only Sonic 2 uses this in a licensed game AFAIK, and that's so it can reuse the 1P graphics in the 2P mode.
<br />
<br />Also there's the fact that the MD has a horizontal scroll table, so there isn't any need to change the scrolling values per <span class="posthilit">line</span> during active scan. Then again, the <span class="posthilit">SNES</span> has a HDMA table while the MD only has a HBlank interrupt, but changing the horizontal scrolling values with HDMA eats up time that could be used for loading other data (e.g. colors).

The fighting game Ehrgeiz for the original PlayStation is one game that uses 320x448 pixels well. But then if you have a 3D game that runs at 60 Hz in 240p, running it in 480i is nearly free anyway. A 2D game, on the other hand, needs more tile graphics, which in turn needs more memory.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">Also there's the fact that the MD has a horizontal scroll table, so there isn't any need to change the scrolling values per <span class="posthilit">line</span> during active scan.</div>
<br />You can't change the <span class="posthilit">vertical</span> position with the horizontal scroll table. So you can do Pole Position, Street Fighter, or NBA Jam (flat road), but not Rad Racer (hills) or Yoshi's Island (boss morphmation). These effects need timed code on the NES, the HDMA features of the Super NES or GBA, or an hblank interrupt.
