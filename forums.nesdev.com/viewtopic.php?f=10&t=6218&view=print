If all other games works fine and that this games never works fine, then it's likely a problem either your soldering or something, I can't think of anything else sorry.

<br />If you could put up photos of the TV/screen showing the problem that'd help narrow it down.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I think if you've tried 6 different carts, and different chips and the only thing that remains constant is the console itself, your problem is probably in the console. Have you tried testing it on another console? The vertical lines you describe sound to me like a problem I get <em>a lot</em> with pretty much any NES game that isn't making good contact within the connector. So I really think your problem lies in the NES not communicating correctly with the cart. This could be happening because of bad soldering (or perhaps bad solder? I don't even know if that's ever a real issue), but it could definitely be because of a bad connector, like Bregalad was saying. The NES connector is among the worst (if not the worst) in world history, so I wouldn't be surprised if that was it.
<br />
<br />I don't believe your problem is a software issue (I'm sure the hack should work on real hardware), simply because it sounds way too much like something that always happens to me when games start to glitch on hardware. You should also make sure you've correctly dumped the graphical data to the CHR chip. Other than that, I'm not really a NES hardware expert at all, so I can't really think of anything.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />It depends on the hack, too.  That's the only game I can ever recall seeing the iNES "trainer" get used on, and that's also what a lot of SMB hacks were based on - that same hacked ROM.  I found that out because of Super ASCII Brothers.  When put on a cart it sort of worked, but in a glitchy 'minus world' with no escape.

<br />You can use the game's continue feature (A+START) to start at World 1-1 if that happens.

<br />a good friend of mine asked to see my CHR-file... and when he checked the sprites they were all fucked up.. sort of!
<br />
<br />So for som reason I have managed to do something wrong when repeating the Chr data  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_redface.gif" alt=":oops:" title="Embarassed" />
<br />
<br />I used Notepad to do it, maybe I´ll have to use a hex-editor insetad! My friend repeated it for me and now it works all fine!
