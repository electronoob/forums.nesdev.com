I would be more than happy to contribute mine if one is needed. Even having a backup to use when the wiki goes down would be nice to have.

<br />
<br />Also, the downtime yesterday was entirely due to router problems - the server itself has been running solid for the past 2 weeks (which is odd, since all we did was swap the two DIMMs between their slots - beforehand, one of them was giving frequent errors in memtest86+).

<br />Since apparently you come to the conclusion it will never be moved to this server, what is wrong with hosting it on another, much faster and reliable one (possibly until that time)?

<br />Something about the monetary cost, maybe?
