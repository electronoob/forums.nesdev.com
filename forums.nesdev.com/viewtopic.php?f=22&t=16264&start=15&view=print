(Kind of like a modern &quot;safe area&quot; but for time after reset?)

I assume they do that to cancel channel/source switching noise/pops and/or take some time to detect a signal in a stable fashion.  The silent pause seems a bit exaggerated though just to hide that or to detect a signal so there might be some other reason?<br /><br />Edit: Come to think of it, many commercial era games begin with some logo and/or legal notice under silence. This way, we don't notice that sound is cut out on modern tv:s/monitors

Very polished. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /> </div><br />Thank you! It's always good to read compliments - but it's 10 times better to read compliments from a talented artist like you.<br /><br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">FrankenGraphics wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">Here's some thoughts, if you're interested in opinions:<br /><br />Difficulty: I like that the difficulty shifts significantly with level style and music. This is the proper place to do so, IMO. <br /><br />Score: The bonus for getting two clovers within a second(?) is a good way to differentiate scores between playthroughs (besides the time bonus). I kind of feel that the time bonus is a bit overshadowed by the massive amount of points you get for clovers, maybe 500 (and 750 when getting one fast) would balance better against time? But if you're fine with the current balance, that's good too. <br /><br />Complexity: Will additional mechanics be introduced along the way? Depending on how many worlds the total game will be, new mechanics can help maintain interest, beside increasing challenge. <br /></div><br />Thanks! I've sent your opinions to Lukasz (he takes care of programming and game rules - while I make graphics and the silly Penguin voice only).<br /><br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">FrankenGraphics wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">Sound: It's hard to judge this without a regular tv to plug into, but the pulse (and maybe also noise) channels felt a bit loud? I often find it more relaxing to the ears tone them down a bit relative to the tri wave, which is often used for bass duties - bass frequencies take more energy/pressure to be percieved as 'loud' than hi-mid frequencies, and conversely, the ear is more sensitive to mid-high tones and sounds. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equal-loudness_contour" class="postlink">Wikipedia article</a> on the subject.</div><br />We don't have how to change anything in music, sorry. It was made by Ozzed and used under a Creative Commons license - he's not actually working with us.<br /><br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">FrankenGraphics wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">Style: Everything looks adorable!

Three things on top of my head you could do: a) A black, dark gray or dark blue/teal drop shadow could help a lot. b) and since you know the exact position of the sprite, you can also soften some jagged edges with another colour between the red and the main bg colour. c) To make it more consistent with the theme, you could swap red for pink (the one you use in the checkerboard) altogether. </div><br />I did the cross sometime ago - but as far as I remember there was almost zero space left for graphics in the bank. So I've made 1/4 of the cross and mirrored/flipped 3 more copies of these same sprites on screen (that's why it will be impossible to make a shadow there, for instance).<br /><br />I'll make tests with different colors - but I confess I like the brownish-red. It looks very unpleasant and it's sort of what I wanted (I want brainwash people to use flicker <span style="text-decoration: underline">all the time</span>!). <img src="./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /><br /><br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">FrankenGraphics wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">Semantics: More a question than an opinion.

On a real NES I think the startup colour is &quot;random&quot; (but each machine probably boots to one particular colour most often).<br /><br />On reset, the pre-title screen is just whatever the last background colour was when I hit reset, so blue or white etc. depending on when I pressed reset.

Animation is gorgeous, and although I haven't tried it out on hardware, the flickering effect looks good on my mobile phone.<br /><br />I would consider taking a more marketable approach than &quot;flicker&quot; when referring to it though, especially since most consumers likely associate <em>flicker </em>with sprite flickering (for scanline usage). Something like &quot;Enhanced Color&quot; and &quot;Standard Color&quot; instead &quot;Flicker&quot; and &quot;X Flicker&quot; could be both more informative and sound more commercial.<br /><br />Then, somewhere in the documentation, or some &quot;learn more&quot; screen of text explain something along the lines of:<br /><br /><em>Enhanced Color mode alternates specially chosen patterns at a rapid rate to produce the illusion of more colors on screen. The effectiveness of this mode depends on your game hardware, type of display, and visual sensitivity. If you find the flickering of Enhanced Color mode distracting or uncomfortable, select Standard Color mode.</em>

I don't think either version looks <em>bad</em> at all, but the no-flicker version is definitely <em>better</em> on this TV in my opinion, and it's not to do with the perception of flickering (non-existent because it's 480i 30fps) but just the problem of interlacing.
