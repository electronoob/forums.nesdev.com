I know that both Dragon Warrior and Bio Force Ape have betas that run from these boards, but neither have the same mapper architecture. BFA is MMC3 and DW is UNROM in Japan and MMC 1 in the US (due to many programming upgrades.)

A lot easier than programming an EPROM. Of course now we have good emulators which are much better at prototyping than the FDS is.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">pemdawg wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">it is incompatible with standard cartridge hardware?</div><br /><br />It's still running on an NES CPU. A lot of the important hardware is the same. If you treat 8000-FFFF as read only, and don't need the extra sound or IRQ, it's kinda trivial to port something that runs on FDS to any cartridge mapper. Even the RAM at 6000, and an equivalent IRQ are also available on several common mappers.

This makes EPROM removal faster and the cartridge much more stable when it's in the Famicom, so it's quite apt as a devcart shell.
