BUT because the &quot;commercial exploitation&quot; of the NES postdates the mask protection law, it &quot;should&quot; have had mask exclusivity until 1993ish or so.<br /><br />I am not a lawyer, so take that with an enormous grain of salt.

The chips used in Dendy was made for PAL countries, but they included some characteristics of the NTSC chips to maintain compatibility with NTSC games, as most games in these markets were either bootlegs of licensed Japanese games, or unlicensed Taiwanese originals.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I'd presume they're using a direct copy of the 6502 mask, so probably the CPU by itself is pretty accurate? (Do famiclones typically have a decimal mode?)<br /><br />It's plausible that there's lots of inaccuracies with the APU/PPU implementations that just haven't been thoroughly investigated. We've spent a lot of time testing dark areas of the authentic NES, but nowhere close to that attention has been spent on clones. That's a whole lot of leeway to do things differently that wouldn't make a noticeable difference in all existing games, or even just almost all.<br /><br />E.g. when I started looking closely at the MMC5, I couldn't find any documentation that precisely described how its length counter was different than the 2A03's, or whether any sweep functionality existed, etc. No existing games used it so it didn't matter unless you actually wanted to go looking for it. Almost all emulators don't have a correct implementation of this stuff, but it completely doesn't matter because there's no ROMs that rely on it.

Plus it already had games.<br />China had and still has lots of engineers. There are technical universities founded only for the reason of mass producing more engineers to quickly build things like railroads.<br /><br />I mean even Japanese Ricoh ripped off the MOS 6502. Unless they really had a legal licence, but I doubt that considering they chopped off the decimal circuitry.

The <br />picture processing unit was designed by UMC and its original <br />purpose was to produce and generate a video output signal <br />for Pal system TV's. The PPU in question was designed in <br />1987 and manufactured commercially a short time later. As <br />you are aware through your technical training it is more <br />difficult to copy an original layout than to produce an <br />original integrated circuit. The PPU was designed with aid <br />of CAD tools using existing functional blocks available in <br />its library. There are many types of PPU's available on the <br />market and we would be surprised if not all but most carry <br />some kind of resemblance due to their design characteristics <br />and their end result in terms of functionality. This <br />similarity can be noticed with a large number of integrated <br />circuits available on the market today. <br />The two devices cannot be directly replaced for each other. <br />Hence the two devices are not functionally compatible. The <br />UA-6538 can process the cartridges designed for NTSC TV <br />systems whereas the RP2007-0 cannot do this due to its <br />inferior design. The interrupt signal timing between these <br />two devices are quite different from each other. This can <br />be tested by measuring on the TV game module (pin 19 on <br />PPU). The DRAM refresh circuits on the RP2007-0 for data <br />retention are not necessary for UA 6538, and please note <br />most importantly that the control timing and data retention <br />method for these two devices are totally different<br /></div>

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Back then no CPU was copyrightable. You could not copyright a CPU, or an instruction set. See the Z80 and 8080 or the NEC V20. However the way MOS did the BCD conversion was unique and patented. It gave MOS an edge. So while Ricoh had the rights to make 6502s, you only needed the license so you could reproduce the BCD circuit. So Ricoh said if you don't take the BCD then we don't have to pay the royalty to MOS and you save money on the chip. I also feel that it would have partly been some spite of Yamauchi - hes not a man to let a slight go unanswered.<br /><br />I feel a big error on the NES was zero ROM. If they had some boot software on the device ( as they corrected on the GB) that would have eventually become protected allowing them to go after clones. Of cause you can still clean room etc but it makes it a lot harder. The Commodore VIC-20/C64 and C128 are anomalies - there are NO clones. The most successful 8bit computers and not a single clone. I mean if you are going to waste your time cloning an Apple II, a ZX Spectrum etc you would think they would put the effort into the most popular computers of all time. The did make clones of the 1541 disk drive however.
