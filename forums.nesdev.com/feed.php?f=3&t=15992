The 2A03 is an NMOS device, which will sink current driving the data lines low. When two NMOS devices face contention, typically the result looks like a logical AND, so in this case, selecting Bank $01 and writing to $1C00C (containing $02) could result in Bank 0 being the result.<br /><br />I expect a typical flash rom (29F* series), a 27C* EPROM, or another ROM behind a level-translating buffer to be a CMOS device, driving data lines high and low.

We've got <a href="http://bootgod.dyndns.org:7777/" class="postlink">other sources</a> for collecting detailed information about various boards. The iNES header is just trying to provide enough information for correct <em>emulation</em>.<br /><br />Software that works as intended probably won't show a difference in emulation between the UxROM and Camerica setups, but <em>all software has bugs</em>. I guess it's like &quot;undefined behaviour&quot; in programming languages, if you consider the bugs to be important to the experience, you need to emulate the correctly. If you consider them to be &quot;undefined&quot;, maybe you don't care whether the bug is accurate to the original, you're ready to reset the game anyway. From the software developer's perspective, you'd probably have good expectations for something to be able to run on both mapper 71 and mapper 2, because you don't know about your own bugs (else you'd fix them). Very popular games have well known and well documented bugs, but unpopular games do too-- and we probably won't discover them if we only ever emulate them as &quot;compatible&quot; hardware. That's the difference this makes.<br /><br />The original iNES file format presumed there would only ever be 16 mappers. Just getting a game to run at all was kind of amazing, and I don't think bus conflicts were even being considered at that point. Splitting Camerica games to mapper 71 was a subsequent refinement. Adding bus conflict emulation was another later refinement, and <em>very</em> lately we can add bus conflict designation as submappers (not really put to much use yet). The final form wasn't known in advance, this is the product of a lot of years of corrections being made.<br /><br />In the case of <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/47744432/dreamworld-pogie-a-new-old-game-by-the-oliver-twin" class="postlink">Dreamworld Pogie</a>, I have no idea whether the carts they eventually made were subject to bus conflicts (did anyone here get one?). The code itself, however, was clearly written with bus conflicts in mind. All the bank writes were through a table, just as you normally do with bus-conflict mappers. The bug was the result of a typo writing to the wrong part of the table.<br /><br />So, I mean, if you're a developer maybe you would want to try your software as if on different compatible boards, but I don't think that's a good example purpose. Usually you would know the intended hardware for your software. Running ROMs on a foreign board isn't really that common, except as a repro/pirate/donor problem, I think? Accidentally causing bugs, though, just by playing, lots of people do that. Intentionally causing bugs as a speedrun exploit, etc. is another thing that many people do (and need accurate emulation to rely on).<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=5165">rainwarrior</a> — Sat May 27, 2017 12:43 pm</p><hr />

The original purpose of submappers was mostly to obviate &quot;ugly hacks&quot; in the existing mapper implementations. If you look at how emulators disambiguate Fire Hawk's special case, it's a big mess. A CRC check is perhaps cleaner but inflexible. Others heuristically change the mirroring behaviour depending on which values get written to $8000 by the game, which seems to work in practice but is a little bit horrifying, if you're of a certain mindset.<br /><br />Its true that these games seem to run compatibly as UNROM, but it depends where you're trying to do the bare minimum to get the games to run, or you want more thorough accuracy. For example, if you were looking to exploit a bug for a speedrun opportunity, it will probably become <em>very</em> relevant whether $8000-BFFF can bank PRG or not.<br /><br />Emulating bugs correctly is important to many people (not just speedrunners). Probably the design of the code never intends to write to $8000-BFFF, but that doesn't mean it won't ever. If you're running on UNROM instead, you <em>know</em> that emulation and discovery of any such behaviour is compromised.<br /><br />Why did they get their own mapper? Because <em>1/4 of the address space doesn't behave like UNROM</em>, and that seems like a huge and clear difference to me. I don't think this is really about &quot;lumping&quot; vs. &quot;splitting&quot;. These mapper assignments were made long before submappers were an idea, the submappers are just a coping mechanism to get us out of that hole. You don't get to reassign mapper 71 in 2017.<br /><br />If you just want to change the headers on your ROMs and run them as UNROM, though, there's really nothing stopping you. Probably none of us in this conversation will notice a difference either way.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=5165">rainwarrior</a> — Fri May 26, 2017 8:27 pm</p><hr />

No, that's not what my argument is at all. My argument is that instead of lumping two incompatible mappers under Mapper 71 (H/V and single-screen mirroring Camerica), two compatible mappers should be lumped under Mapper 2 (UNROM and H/V mirroring Camerica).<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=133">NewRisingSun</a> — Fri May 26, 2017 1:16 pm</p><hr />

^^^ well-put. Problem is, of course, that submappers favor lumping (+submapper assignment), and iNES backwards-compatibility favors splitting (…sort of. Some mappers are allocated in this spirit, others are lumped, like MIMIC-1), and NES2.0 unifies these features…<br /><br />iNES header does not have a configuration meaning &quot;one-screen mirroring&quot;…and the Quattro games aren't 1s, either.<br /><br /><span style="font-size: 75%; line-height: normal">I should really get back to making the submappers for PP.</span><p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=6603">Myask</a> — Fri May 26, 2017 12:39 pm</p><hr />

There's been a long simmering argument—I can't really call it a debate, because ultimately it's not really rational—between &quot;lumpers&quot; and &quot;splitters&quot; in allocating mappers.<br /><br />&quot;Lumpers&quot; say that two boards can be emulated using the same code, so they should be the same mapper.<br />&quot;Splitters&quot; say that the hardware on the boards is different, and that a game <em>could</em> be found that would require separate implementations.<br /><br />But ... anyway ... I'd just like to point out that your argument ultimately boils down to &quot;FCEUX should implement submappers so that the Everdrive doesn't have to&quot;<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3512">lidnariq</a> — Fri May 26, 2017 12:10 pm</p><hr />
