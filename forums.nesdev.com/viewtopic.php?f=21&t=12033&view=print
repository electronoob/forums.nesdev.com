		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Yes I agree git is very good to use. It is nice to have a history of what you have changed in your project. Also as for bugs in programs is the author aware of them? I know for my project Retro Graphics Toolkit I want to hear about bugs in my program so that I can fix them. I have fixed some bugs that caused me to think if only someone would have told me about that. I would have fixed it sooner. I fixed some bugs after releasing a new version but have held off due to no one has complaining.

This is common sense. If you don't make backups, you're asking to lose data, no matter how stable and bug-free your tools are.</div><br />I think the point was to back-up before <em>every time you open the program</em>. Regularly will not be good enough, e.g. if your last back-up is from yesterday but you edited the file several times today and then the file gets corrupted, you will lose all of today's progress (and it can be a lot).<br /><br />The git suggestion would help in this case (or any version control system, for that matter). In fact this is very much the main point of them, to be able to easily roll back in case the changes to the file end up breaking something. But they still have the downside that you need to be explicitly commiting every change and here you may actually forget to do that (so you'll need to find a way to automate this if possible).
