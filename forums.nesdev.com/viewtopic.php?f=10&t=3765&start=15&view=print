<br />
<br />0 AND 0 = 0 
<br />0 AND 1 = 0

<br />0 XOR 1 = 1
<br />1 XOR 0 = 1
<br />1 XOR 1 = 0
<br />
<br />NAND = AND with inverted (NOT) output
<br />NOR = OR with inverted output
<br />XNOR = XOR with inverted output
<br />
<br />If you're going to do digital design, then you should learn boolean algebra, but the above is all that's really necessary for bit masking.

<br />the chart is simple venn diagrams numbered by their binary truth table with ascii-based engineering notation for the logic gates using just OR/NOT/AND.
<br />
<br />it's as low level as its going to get.
<br />
<br />i used to teach third graders using the original version of that chart using decals of each entry fused to the vertices of a physical hypercube i built. and they understood it fine. the complete newbies here seem to understand my chart while the self-hyped gurus such as yourself don't understand it at all. obviously you traded intuition for de-education, impo.
<br />
<br />
<br />de-education btw is the united states public schools common practice of telling students conceptualization they intuitively put together on their own from course work is baseless and worthless wasted time, due to not being useful for the limited set of information in the task at hand, the teachers or the course normally not knowing how to intuitively put such conceptualization together on their own as they were also taught by their own teachers one can only learn by being reliant on the information published by others.
<br />
<br />such practices have led to the united states producing most of the stupidest adults in all of the world, having even worse self-reliance than most children in even the most devastated of third world countries.
<br />
<br />just like the student witness on the underlying realities based fictional television comedy Boston Legal claimed the other day. Most US Americans do not even understand the simple survival instinct that direction of north-west is obvious when one knows the relative positions of the sun, moon, or stars.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I finally understand this table!. Each square covers a different logic function, of the 16 possible functions involving two boolean inputs (including ones which don't even examine the inputs). The result is shown in two ways, graphically and as a binary value. The function is also expressed in two ways, as a named binary operator and as an expression involving the common operators ! (NOT), | (OR), &amp; (AND), and ^ (XOR).
<br />
<br />Graphically, it's fairly simple. There are two fruits with some overlap, and a background. The left (apple) represents A, the right (orange) B. This forms four regions: neither A nor B (the water background), A only (the non-overlapped part of the apple), B only (the non-overlapped part of the orange), and A and B (the overlapping part). Each of these regions can be either colored or outlined; when colored, the function is true in this case, otherwise it's false.
<br />
<br />The four bit binary value is the least obvious. It represents the same information as the image. The bits correspond to the following inputs being true: AB, A, B, (none). So with OR you get 1110 (true as long as either A or B is true), with AND you get 1000 (true only when both A and B are true).
<br />
<br />To summarize each function (sorry, challenge not included):
<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">1 1 0 0&nbsp; A&nbsp; &nbsp;Inputs<br />1 0 1 0&nbsp; B<br />--------------------<br />0 0 0 0&nbsp; FALSE<br />0 0 0 1&nbsp; NOR<br />0 0 1 0&nbsp; JUST B<br />0 0 1 1&nbsp; NOT A<br />0 1 0 0&nbsp; JUST A<br />0 1 0 1&nbsp; NOT B<br />0 1 1 0&nbsp; A XOR&nbsp; B<br />0 1 1 1&nbsp; A NAND B<br />1 0 0 0&nbsp; A AND&nbsp; B<br />1 0 0 1&nbsp; A XNOR B<br />1 0 1 0&nbsp; B<br />1 0 1 1&nbsp; A IMP&nbsp; B<br />1 1 0 0&nbsp; A<br />1 1 0 1&nbsp; A LIMP B<br />1 1 1 0&nbsp; A OR&nbsp; &nbsp;B<br />1 1 1 1&nbsp; TRUE</div>

<br />
<br />I've tasted raw garlic cloves before. You're right, they burn worse than hot pepper seeds. I was once cooking, and I cut up some garlic. I thought I'd just try a peice of it. It was so sick. No wonder vampires are allergic to it.
<br />
<br />By the way, I need to keep looking at your poster you've displayed. I don't even understand it. I don't know if someone who's new to the NESdev scene will.
