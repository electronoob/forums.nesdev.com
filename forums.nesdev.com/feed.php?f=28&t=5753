Because your goal was not to make a video game in the pure sense of the word put to experiment on a specific platform. What is wrong with that?  You can learn a lot from working on obscure platforms because of the limitation they have. In that case, the emulators can cut a lot of testing time and if people want to learn from it, they don't need to have that platform with the current state of technologies. Why would they? (and I think we derailed the main thread thought).<br /><br />I got an answer from the person I helped for the VRCIV so at least I feel better about helping him.

Well as far as I can recall I've always been more insterested in developing games than playing them since I was 11 years old, maybe even before. I just completely lacked any programming skills.<br /><br />And there is not much reason people who knowns nothing about electronics would want to open crack their carts and makes experiments. Emulators allow you to play games that are hard to find. With accurate emulation and NTSC filter there is NOT any reason not to use them, in fact even since I have a power pak I still prefer playing games emulated because of the better screen of my computer, NTSC emulation, reliable saves, no TV buzzing noise, no graphic glitches and flickering POWER button, etc...<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=38">Bregalad</a> — Mon Nov 23, 2009 1:04 pm</p><hr />

Wow, it's a kind of revolution here, isn't it? Well, I don't mind people wanting to make repros/bootlegs, there are many good reasons for a person to do this: play games that are hard to find, games of other regions, homebrews, translations, hacks, etc. What bothers me is that nobody seems to do any research before asking. We see the same questions over and over, and this is the annoying part.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=95">tokumaru</a> — Mon Nov 23, 2009 12:17 pm</p><hr />
