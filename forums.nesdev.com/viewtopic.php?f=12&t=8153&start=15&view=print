<br />
<br />A third chip that was never touched prior works perfectly fine.  As of right now, I have 4 working M29F032D's and 1 working AM29F032B mounted on those Chinese carrier boards.  I will be working on mounting more of the AMD/Spansion parts tonight.

<br />
<br />If you are getting nothing but 00's off the chip, I would look at either a bad solder connection, or a bad chip.  That is the problem I was running into with my refurbished AMD/Spansion parts.

The soldering job on the TSOP look perfect even with 30x magnifying glass. I wasted a day on that and still didn't managed to have the chip program or ID correctly. I'm using type 1 board and used peccost's willem adapter design (hand wired, not the actual pcb design). I also started trying with the type 2 board but wasn't sure what pad to short or if the resistor were mandatory. I shorted all the 3 pad but still same issue programming the chip.

I don't have great equipment. so for the first time I bought some solder paste and flux paste and plan on doing it over a skillet... but I realized i should have got flux LIQUID -.- . So I will just be using the solder paste.. I have never done this before I don't want to screw it up -.-

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I found them very easy to solder using the pull technique and a small flat/angled tip. Use a lot of flux and it will prevent creating bridge. It's seriously fun to solder once you master the drag technique. Look on youtube as there's alot of video showing the drag technique for cleanly soldering TSOP IC. I'll have to recheck my adapter but im 99% sure my TSOP soldering job is perfect.
