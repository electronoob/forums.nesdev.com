		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Well, I wasted a few days of my life and made something I always wanted, the Action 52 NSF!
<br />
<br />Since Cheetahmen 2 uses the same music, I guess this is a rip of that too.  The CM2 title theme is just "Fuzz Power".
<br />
<br />Anyways, it was a huge massive hack, but was alot of fun too.
<br />
<br />I started by disassembling the music engine, and learned that it was the same across all 52 games.  The code on it appears to be "too good" for the A52, and I highly suspect it might be ripped from somewhere.
<br />
<br />I will post the complete commented source for it soon, after I clean it up, along with the music data format.
<br />
<br />Basically what I did was I dumped a 32K bank of every single Action 52 game including the intro to Cheetahmen (it's a "game" like the others) and then all 6 of the Cheetahmen levels (which are separate "games" too).
<br />
<br />Incidentally, the special title screens on a few of the other games are also separate "games", as are the screens of the intro.
<br />
<br />I did not capture the digital audio in this rip but I will eventually. It all does raw writes to 4011 and does not use DPCM at all, even on the Cheetahmen game.
<br />
<br />After ripping the game banks (58 of them), I wrote a QBASIC program to go through and check/extract all the music it could find, verifying that the data was good.  It also relocated the music to 0000h, from wherever it happened to be.
<br />
<br />Turns out there were alot of crappy pointers that lead to never-never land and were not used!
<br />
<br />After all that, I had 300-some separate track files which held all the "tunes" and SFX, one per file.  I ZIPed them up and then sorted by CRC to remove the duplicates, leaving just 1 copy of everything.
<br />
<br />Then I wrote some more QBASIC to stitch and relocate the music into banks.
<br />
<br />Incidentally, the music and data was just sprayed ALL OVER ROM... After seeing this, I'm almost convinced the games were put together with a hex editor.  There were all sorts of little errors in the music due to what looked like manual data entry.
<br />
<br />That "unpaused" SFX is in nearly every game, and it appeared in memory in 40 places or so- a different place for each game.  The music driver almost always used the same places in RAM (390-48f) except for games with a title screen, and the cheetahmen, but the driver code was again sprayed all over the ROM.
<br />
<br />Fortunately, finding the table offset was fairly easy, so knowing that my programs could extract the music fairly effectively.
<br />
<br />Once I had all the parts I did some very minimal mods to the player code (basically adding bank support) and made the NSF.
<br />
<br />I hope people enjoy <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":-)" title="Smile" />

<br />Not sure if it's complete otherwise (has 124 tracks, but first 10 or so are the samples, so the real song number is a bit lower than in your file).

<br />Do you have any more information on what music system was used?  Again this is all new info to me, and is not anywhere in easily accessable form that I could find.
