<br />
<br />Usually regular breakpoints and Data breakpoints are enough to solve whatever I'm trying to do.  If I don't know the address of a variable, the cheat finder helps too.

<br />You can't track RAM address in ROM.But you can track instructions quite simple. The "lda $043C" instruction is at $81AC.
<br />Open Hex editor and get to that address.Now use Right Mouse Button, Select "Go here in ROM file".Adress will change to the in ROM file address.
<br />About understanding-I agree with 3gengames.

<br />Change your breakpoint to a write breakpoint, and the debugger will stop at every point in the ROM where the code writes to that location. You can see the bank and address number (which can be translated to a location in the ROM) at the far left of the disassembly.

<br />
<br />
<br />And look to the very left of the debugger info. It'll say a number in hex between 8000-FFFF. That's the ROM. The leftmost is where in the memory map it is. Although the lower bank of 8000-FFFF (8000-BFFF) is usually swapped out for data, more code, etc. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />

<br />
<br />But seriously, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_switching" class="postlink">it's like turning the pages in the ROM</a>. The NES CPU can't see all the ROM at once, and it needs to go back and forth between parts of the ROM. It does that by writing a value back to the ROM. You can't really write to ROM (that's why it's <em>read-only</em> memory), but if the CPU tries to do that, a "mapper" chip on the cartridge will see the write and treat it as a command to turn the page.
<br />
<br />PROTIP: Read a few <a href="http://wiki.nesdev.com/w/index.php/Before_the_basics" class="postlink">Wikipedia articles about information science</a>, and things will become easier to understand.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Let me try to explain a bit about banks too...
<br />
<br />Each CPU has a limit of how much memory it can see/work with. The NES CPU can see 64KB, so everything needed to make a game work has to fit in that space: RAM, ROM and registers (registers are special memory locations used to "talk" to the various parts of the system). The NES divides that space in a way that only 32KB is dedicated to the ROM.
<br />
<br />The first few NES games did fit into that space, but once games started becoming more complex, 32KB of ROM became too little. The problem is that even though you can easily make the carts larger, the CPU can never "see" more memory than it was designed to. The trick to solve this problem is to make different parts of a larger memory chip visible in the small 32KB window.
<br />
<br />NES carts started to break down the 32KB space into slots (some carts use only 1 slot which is the whole 32KB, others use 2 16KB slots, and even 4 8KB slots), and they are able to make different chunks (i.e. banks) of the ROM visible into those slots as the program runs.
<br />
<br />This is how games can be infinitely large while the CPU can see no more 64KB of memory.
