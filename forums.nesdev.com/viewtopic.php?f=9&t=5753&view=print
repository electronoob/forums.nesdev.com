<br />The powerpak is just a bootleg also so WTF? <img src="./images/smilies/icon_confused.gif" alt=":?" title="Confused" /> Why not just explain to him what he's looking to do seeing as you know what he's talking about instead of shitting on him for wanting to learn?

Now a cartridge with EPROMs hacked into place and a new label slapped on it certainly is a bootleg. Sorry but you just seemed to be insulting or belittling the PowerPAK. 
<br />
<br />Also your arguement about people wanting to "learn" doesn't hold up well since it seems many people building cartridges ask the same things over and over because they don't understand what they are doing thus they need instructions for everything.
<br />
<br />gamedude:
<br />What you need to do is look at how D0 and D1 of the CPU connect to the 74HC161 chip on the PCB. Then you need to connect D2 in the same manner which will allow your board to support 64K max rather than 32K. You'll need to find the next free input and output on the chip which means you need to google a data sheet for 74HC161. That next free input and output as I said should be used with D2, the two sets already in use connect to D0 and D1 so you'll have a perfect example of what you need to do already on the board.

<br />Yeah that's exactly what I was thinking, better worded.
<br />
<br />And yeah for the answer you need to connect D2 of your '161 to PRG D2 after cutting it from anything else it may be connected (VCC or GND I guess), and connect Q2 of the '161 to A14 of your CHR-ROM. I'm pretty sure it's not the first time this is said on this board tough.

<br />Regarding the recent spur of "I want to make repro X", the reason I don't agree much with it is because I helped a few person that promised that they will make tutorial for helping making them. What happened? We never heard back of them. If they really made tutorials, they never posted back on nesdev.

<br />If I find any CNROM donors at the pawn and I feel up to the task I might make this particular guide as I know alot of folks want to be able to repro the porno games.

<br />
<br />If someone that have interest in repro could in the end make those guides, we could after that re-direct those threads to that guide either on the wiki or a text document, which ever is easier to use.  The only problem, like I mentioned, is most of those people are not regulars and vanished after their repro were done.
<br />
<br />I helped another person recently for pins for JDEC and VRCIV for gradius 2 through pm and when I asked a question once he got the information he was looking for, I never received back any answer at all. But when he didn't have the answer, he was answering right away. Maybe in that case it's not intentional and the person is not a regular but still. This is usually what happen. So I'm a little bit bitter in the end. Maybe once the person saw this message he will check the simple message I sent, who knows <img src="./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" /> But for now, unless I know it's for a devcart, I may not be as nice anymore.

<br />I will try to refrain myself to help on the subject (usually I don't) because of past experience but I cannot stop other people helping if they feel like it.  
<br />
<br />For me it's clear: I want to focus on nesdev, not bootlegging games.  So if I read the hardware and flash equipment forum it's because I want to see things related to deving.
