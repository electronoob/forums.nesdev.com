They are both 8k and... well, maybe it is a stupid Idea, maybe the pinouts are totally different or maybe it is not possible at all, but I just had to ask... Thanks for the help!

<br />I see... if I change it to VRAM it will be a definitive change. Sadly I have only one NROM board. In case I ever decide to actually do this, is there info about this somewhere? The pinouts, mainly...
<br />
<br />EDIT: I see now that the main page of nesdev has a document with the pinouts of the WRAM chip. I may try and play cool, pretending I know what I am doing, but I really doubt I can actually see everything that needs to be rewired. I'll try anyway, and if I have any doubts I'll ask here.
<br />
<br />And Quietust, how would I go about connecting the write signal?

I've got an idea to make a WRAM-VRAM shared memory, but that's a whole other thing. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />
<br />
<br />If you get a new RAM chip for any reason, it's usually cheaper/easier to find a 62256 (32kB).
<br />
<br />Also, 6264 chips have both a positive and negative chip enable.  That's fine as long as the positive CE is held at 5V.

<br />Virgule (/OE) or overline (O&#773;E&#773;): active low, meaning that the signal is asserted when at a logic value 0 (tied to GND).
<br />
<br />As for "PRG", that's short for program. I guess it has something to do with the fact that some EPROMs and EEPROMs take a higher voltage to write than to read.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Thanks for the help. I'm planning on giving it a try this weekend, but I have one more question for now: the /WR pin is pin number 56 on the cart, right? I don't heve my cart here right now, but I know it lacks some pins by the middle, where pin 56 would be. So there is a possibility that this procedure can't be done to the Spy vs Spy cart?
<br />
<br />I got another NROM game yesterday, though, it's Gyromite. This board is in much better shape than the Spy vs Spy one, and has all the pins, so I figured this would be my main NROM devcart, and Spy vs Spy was going to be used for experimental stuff (such as changing CHR-ROM for CHR-RAM). But if it lacks pin 56 I guess it is impossible then?
<br />
<br />Thanks again for the help so far.
<br />
<br />EDIT: OK, looking at the pinouts I think pin 56 (CHR /WR) of the cart has to be connected to pin 27 (/WE) on the 6264. Is that it? What else needs to be done? I think pin 26 on tthe 6264 needs some handling, but I'm really not sure of anything.

<br />It needs to change a lot on-board adress decoding. I'm not exacly sure how it works, so don't ask to me.

<br />The complexity of what happens when the CPU and PPU try to access CHR RAM at once is probably why no board maps CHR RAM into CPU space.

<br />That's not the point. I mean that effectivly be able to modify half of it by normal writes to $6000-$7fff when unused would be quite comfortable. Sorry if I confused people talking about advantages of CHROM or CHRRAM, that isn't what I really wanted to talk about.

<br />That'd also be very cool. As long as the tiles beeing updated were not beeing rendered/used at the same time. Very usefull to update part of the tileset for the next frame(s).

<br />That would need to interfere two pattern tables. The first frame, the actual pattern table is swapped into PPU $0000-$1fff, and the programm can freely write data to $6000-$7fff during the frame. Then, on next VBlank, the mapper exchange both RAM segments, allowing the programm to change a lot of pattern table tiles every frame.
<br />However, for non-dynamic tiles, you'll need to load them twice before using, once per swappable pattern table. That'd still be very cool.

<br />Imagine doing a routine doing software mosaic effets on tiles.
<br />With random acess, it would be pretty easy with some mask logic and shifts opperations. Just copy the color of a pixel on the pixel to it's right, to it's bottom and to it's bottomright in a gird of 2x2 pixels, then do the same for 3x3, 4x4, etc... to get bigger mosaics.
<br />Without random acess, it need a large buffer where all images that changed their mosaic size should be copied to VRAM. But with such random acess, it would be much more abordable.
