Did you factor that in as well? <br /><br />One suggestion you might consider before buying in bulk adapters and flash memory would be to buy a small number and see how it goes. You might find surface mount soldering too troublesome. Or you might not. It's just a suggestion. I personally don't think it's worth it to do it that way when there is an alternative. Plus rewrite-ability is very appealing.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />i ended up only buying 10 adapters and 10 chips. didn't break the bank but it will be the test run. <br /><br />i think the reflashable board is very cool, but it's also pricey, and i'd have to buy the programmer for that board as well, and with an entry fee per cart that high, i'd be less likely to pass a game or two off to friends. I admin a collector's site on facebook and we send eachother mystery boxes occasionally, and i'd love to toss repros or translations in the boxes for people as well since many of them like them but won't pay for them. <br /><br />and as of now i'm sitting on about 40 usable donor carts, and the local retro store has a couple boxes of sports games at a buck a piece i can dig through if i ever run out.

It does however use the S-DD1 both as an MMC and as a decompression chip. neviksti made a hack that removes the usage of the S-DD1 chip and expands it to 96mbit to run on certain copiers and flash carts which lack S-DD1 support. bsnes can run both: it emulates the S-DD1 natively, and you can specify custom mapping files to support larger ROM sizes. It's not an official mapper (in fact it's actually a really weird mapping), hence neviksti's version won't run out of the box. But get the right manifest (board mapping) and it'll run just fine. Certain copiers and flash carts can run the latter, but none of them yet emulate the actual S-DD1.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I know they are relatively pricey, compared to the prices you are talking about for the INL cart or flash chips, but I would recommend getting a flash cart anyway. I am trying to get a super everdrive with a usb port for dev stuff that I am doing, but I have found that some hacks don't perform as expected/or as they do in an emulator. <br /><br />I don't use BSNES for actually playing ROM files, so if you use that to test ROMs it seems pretty close to 100% accurate (there are some rare times with IRQ or VBlank code that don't emulate exactly the same, but that's mostly stuff having to do with bad SNES assembly I've written, not BSNES/higan).<br /><br />I was first doing ROM hacking in 2007/2008 when I was in college (<!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://vimeo.com/85569648">https://vimeo.com/85569648</a><!-- m -->), and my soldering skills were not the best even with regular DIP chips, so I ended up going through a few carts to get it to work. It's good to make sure that actual ROM works on the real hardware.<br /><br />Another option is to have a few different carts and put ZIF sockets in them<br /><img src="http://benjaminsantiago.com/portfolio_2008/images/Games/SuperMythosLand_cart.jpg" alt="Image" /><br />and then use them to test on real hardware.<br /><br />It seems like you (Max Vador) have some experience with this kind of stuff so maybe some of it is redundant.

Could be my soldering but I find with just the PCB, hacked carts tend to operate erratically.
