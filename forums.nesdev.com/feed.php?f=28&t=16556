Basically what you need is a demux, just like <a href="http://www.play-hookey.com/digital/combinational/decoder_demux_two.html" class="postlink">this one.</a> <br />It will enable or disable the memory chips according to the address on the input.<br />If you have a MAD chip onboard you probably already have it.<br />Just think a little. the information that was give here is enough, you just need to look at it carefully.<br />If you have some more doubts about the circuit I'm sure people here can help.<br /><br />Sincerelly, I think combinational logic should be teached at school.<br />It took me a long time to (kind of) learn it... the teachers on the technician course didn't know it very well. Damm!! Even hexadecimal numbering was considered a thing of another world!!<br />I ended learning the basics of it at university, on the architecture &quot;chair&quot; (I don't know how the parts of a university course are called, so I'm using the word &quot;chair&quot; that is what it's called here...).<br />I ended up learning a lot more here in the forums. But still there's a huge amount of things i need/want to learn!<br /><br />Good luck!<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=7094">Fisher</a> — Thu Oct 12, 2017 3:37 pm</p><hr />

Getafix (aka retrostage) is right.  These questions have been asked many times before.  This group is more about --- do your research and while we (this group) won't just hand out an answer, but will do is push you in the right direction so that you can learn what you want to know and <em>maybe</em> get confirmation on your questions at that point. <br /><br />Without tooting my own horn, there are other new repo pcb boards avail than just those mentioned in the prev post.  <br />Good luck!<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=5779">Markfrizb</a> — Sun Oct 08, 2017 9:37 pm</p><hr />
