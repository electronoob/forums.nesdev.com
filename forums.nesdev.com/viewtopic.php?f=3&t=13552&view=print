		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I know that it's the same engine(same emulator), but different games has to use different data files, right?<br /><br />I meant data files that define how to coop with different tiles/sprites, like how 'thick' a wall tile and a ground tile are (from the video it's obvious that a wall tile is not as thick as a ground tile, and the text fonts are even thinner, intentionally) and in case of pipes, etc., what models to use.<br /><br />Of course when no such data file is provided an emulator may still consider each tile/sprite as a block of the same thickness, just won't look as good.<br /><br />This is similar to the HD emulators, in which you need to provide new graphics for each game.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />No, the 3d scene rendering is based on automatic &quot;on the fly&quot; analysis of 2d scene. I don't follow the approach of HD Nes. This approach requires huge amount of graphic work done to let just a game played. You can see that when an object is rendered for the first time, the game become a little lag due to the analysis computation.

Then a set of heuristics rules will be used to assign each object a pattern which will be used later to convert this objects into 3d. That's the mechanism behind it.

In order for this thing to work flawlessly (or even close to it) without hacks, it would practically have to be a human looking at the game. And just thinking, in the case of Battletoads, I guess it would also have to infer what is supposed to be up, and what is supposed to be further in the background for the characters.

What the emu has succeeded to establish is the infrastructure, the framework. In the future, more semantic info will be collected from 2D scene,more predefined patterns will be added, more rules will be created to make the emu more robust. You say it right there will never be a perfect solution for this kind of problem but better solution is always possible. For the camera mode/direction detection: top down, left right or front back, perspective or orthographic or 2d projection, currently the emu has not detected it yet so the render will not be good for 3d camera or complex background game.<br /><br />And when the emu becomes mature enough, the optimization for a specific game is as simple as values assigning for a set of coefficient. That's how i see things.
