Or the duty cycle of the resultant clock needs to be 50%, not 46%. Or they were lazy and removed the AND gate instead of drawing new silicon.<br /><br />But yeah, we can only take educated guesses.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3512">lidnariq</a> — Tue Dec 09, 2008 7:53 am</p><hr />

PAL NES systems are clocked with 26.58Mhz masterclock. 26.58Mhz / 6 = 4.43Mhz = PAL colorburst.<br /><br />NTSC NES systems are clocked with 21.48Mhz masterclock. 21.48Mhz / 6 = 3.58Mhz = NTSC colorburst.<br /><br />Now, the PAL pixelclock is generated by:<br /><br />26.58Mhz / 5 = 5.31Mhz<br /><br />So far, they solved this most elegantly, because the 5.31Mhz PAL pixelclock is very close to the NTSC pixelclock of 5.37Mhz (21.48Mhz / 4). With 340 PPU per per line, the PAL NES yields 15.62khz with 50.1Hz using 312 lines.<br /><br />But why on earth did they choose 26.58Mhz / 16 = 1.66Mhz, instead of 26.58Mhz / 15 = 1.77Mhz, which would be nearly identical to the NTSC CPU speed (21.48Mhz / 12 = 1.79Mhz)?

<div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"><br />Nestopia are very accurate, they even emulates the imperfection of MMC3's counter quite well.<br />But you'd still want to test on the real hardware after you developped the routine, and possibly fine tune the timing a little.<br /></div><br /><br />Absolutely, since there are slight differences between Nestopia and Nintendulator. In order to produce a clean stable raster split on Nintendulator, I need to delay writes to palette ram 1 more cycle than Nestopia. But currently, it looks perfect on all 3 major emulators (even FCE Ultra), so I am guessing (hoping) that it will work equally well on real hardware. <br /><br />What I am most proud of is the fact that the routine works equally well on both PAL and NTSC mode (after lots of tweaking), depite PAL having severely less cycles per line. Coming from the C64, this scenario is much worse than the 63 vs 64 vs 65 cycle issue on the C64.<br /><br />Now the other issue is: should homebrew software be made so it can run on emulators, or should it further explore the quirks of the original hardware.... <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" /><p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3760">6502freak</a> — Mon Dec 08, 2008 8:58 am</p><hr />
