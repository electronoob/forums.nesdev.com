		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Could you help with the paddlewidth <img src="./images/smilies/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt=":roll:" title="Rolling Eyes" /> you mentioned?
<br />(and paddleheight and left and right)
<br />
<br />Lets take 1 step back first.
<br />I made 2 moving balls what did i use for that..
<br />
<br />-variables :   ballx and bally
<br />
<br />-initial ball stats : lda #$30  sta ballx  and lda #$40 sta bally
<br />
<br />-update sprites :lda sta the Y,sprite,attribute,X
<br />
<br />-update ball sprite: for the controls
<br />
<br />So i thought .. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt=":roll:" title="Rolling Eyes" />  how do i get paddlewidth to start with the checks you mentioned.
<br />
<br />so i looked here on the forum and google and i saw most people use these variables.
<br />
<br />-top
<br />-down
<br />-left
<br />-right
<br />
<br />So i thought where are the x and y ? seems that
<br />
<br />left=x  and y = top
<br />right = x + width
<br />down = y + height
<br />
<br />MY QUESTION : 
<br />
<br />1. How do i get the the width and the height?
<br />
<br />and 
<br />
<br />2. how do i put it in my code?
<br />
<br />My incomplete awnser and guesing..
<br />
<br />1.width is x +other tiles   / height is y+ other tiles,for exsample a pong paddle of 4 tiles is the y +the other 3.
<br />
<br />2. how to put in code
<br />
<br />variables = well.. left right top bottum .rs 1
<br />
<br />initial ball stats= uhm.. left is x and top is y,but what about the right side of the ball and the bottum? Can this be the same also #$30 and 40 like my exsample? and if ther more pixels the would be a multiple lda #$ followed by sta ballright?
<br />
<br />update sprites= well this gets confusing i gues multiple loadoing lda?

<br />
<br />Most of that sounds good except for a couple of things. 
<br />
<br />Did you set up the disappearing sprite I mentioned? If so you can do this one step at a time to make sure the parts work before the whole.
<br />
<br />Also:
<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">lda object x<br />clc<br />adc #$08<br />clc;There is no need for this.<br />cmp object2 x<br />bcc check something<br /></div>
<br />Using clc before adc is right, because if the carry could possibly be set it adds one more.
<br />
<br />But using clc (or sec) before cmp is not needed. cmp acts the same no matter what the carry flag is, and it either clears or sets the carry flag based on the values. So doing something with the carry flag immediately before a cmp can serve no purpose.
<br />
<br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">y is 1 below that add 7 to get the bottom</div><br />If I understand correctly, you want to add 7 because the y sprites are drawn 1 pixel from their actual position?<br /><br />That is actually good thinking, but because all sprites are affected the same by that you should still add 8. Unless you are adding 7 for another reason.<br /><br />Edit: Actually, some other quick things:<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">variables = well.. left right top bottum .rs 1 </div><br />Actually, you don't ever need to store the right and bottom variables. In the code you wrote, you'll notice the cmp can happen without ever storing the right value to RAM. And once the cmp is done you don't need it again. <br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">update sprites= well this gets confusing i gues multiple loadoing lda?<br /></div>
<br />Yep! You'll be doing lots of loading and storing. 
<br />
<br />When we get this working, there is a slightly better way to handle objects but I will avoid that for now.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />There are some mistakes in there i think.
<br />For exsample: #$32 is for a 4 sprites paddle but this should be #$24 because the top already takes 8 sprites ,i only need to add the bottum 3 rows.
<br />
<br />I really thought because x is the top the first y is only 7 and x pics up the other 1.So that would mean #$31 in total or #$ 23.
<br />
<br />Another thing is coding in general .I thought its set in stone, but i see that doing something like a collision can be done in may ways.
<br />
<br />I saw a collision code that works with bcc only  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt=":roll:" title="Rolling Eyes" /> I thought that can't work but it did because the programmer swapped the player and the ball instead of using bcc and bcs.

About the disappearing sprite<br /></div><br />You have already succeeded in getting a sprite to move up and down.<br /><br />You did this by adding to its y position while down is held, and subtracting from its y position while up is held.<br /><br />The screen is 240 pixels high.<br /><br />For the disappearing sprite, just do some setup. Each time before you check for the condition it should appear on, set its y position to #$FE (A value larger than the screen's resolution).<br /><br />Then check the condition you want it to appear on (like A button being pressed), and set its y position to something on screen (like #$80) only if A is pressed. <br /><br />So... its y position starts at #$FE. And that will only change if the condition is true. <br /><br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">Happens every frame: sprite's y pos is set to #$FE<br />Check if A is pressed.<br />if A is pressed, y becomes #$80.<br />else y keeps the value you set before. &#40;So it would still be #$FE&#41;<br /></div><br /><br />When A is pressed, it appears. When released, it disappears. <br /><br /><span style="color: red"><strong>Get that working before continuing. It's important.</strong></span> If you still have trouble with it, ask about THAT. No collision detection until the disappearing sprite works. Easy stuff before hard stuff. The reason I want you to do this is so you have something that will immediately tell you when something is not working. The code on your paper can't work. The disappearing sprite would tell you why if you checked each condition with it. <br /><br />Edit: #$24 is different than #24. When you put a $, that means the number is in hex. #$24 = 36. #$32 is 50.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">Another thing is coding in general .I thought its set in stone, but i see that doing something like a collision can be done in may ways. <br /></div><br />Absolutely. There are a millions way to get the same result in programing. It's the same with math. I want the number 4. 2*2, 2+2, 8/2, 9/3+1 etc. They all get 4. <br /><br />The most important thing is that you understand what you're trying to do. If you do, you can find many ways to do the same thing and can choose which one is best for you instead of relying on a possibly confusing piece of code. <br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">For exsample: #$32 is for a 4 sprites paddle but this should be #$24 because the top already takes 8 sprites ,i only need to add the bottum 3 rows. <br /></div>
<br />I don't understand this. A 4 sprite tall paddle would be exactly 32 pixels tall. But the top doesn't already take up 8 pixels (I assume you meant pixels). The position you have represents a pixel, not a sprite. 
<br />
<br />Sprites actually have very little to do with it. Let's pretend they don't exist for a bit. 
<br />
<br />You know the X location of your object. You know the y location of your object. This point is the top left corner of your object. It is a single point. Adding a width value to the X location makes your object grow that many pixels bigger to the right of this point. Adding a height value to the Y location makes your object grow that many pixels pixels bigger below that point.
<br />
<br />How many pixels wide do you want your paddles to be? 8? Then you add 8. But this can be ANY number. It doesn't have to be a multiple of 8 just because sprites always are. 
<br />
<br />How many pixels tall do you want your paddles to be? 32? Then you add 32. 24? Then you add 24? 
<br />
<br />Depending on how your code is written, you're right. You should add 1 less, but you should do it for BOTH axises not just one. It's also possible to add more and use different branches, but bleh. A pixel difference won't matter for your first routine. When you understand it you can make it perfect.
<br />
<br />The sprites have nothing to do with your collision detection. They help the player see what's going on, but they just don't matter to the computer checking positions. You can write working collision detection code on a computer that displays no graphics.
<br />
<br />So the fact that your paddle is made up of multiple sprites shouldn't affect what your collision detection is doing at all.
<br />
<br />Forget the paddles. Forget the ball. Forget every sprite except the one that disappears and reappears.
<br />
<br />You know 4 things about two objects.
<br />
<br />1. You know each object's X position (Left side of the object).
<br />2. You know each object's Y position (top of the object).
<br />3. You know each object's Width.
<br />4. You know each object's Height.
<br />
<br />Now use your disappearing sprite.
<br />
<br />I asked you earlier to make two sprites that move. One of those sprites will be object1. The other will be object2. 
<br />
<br />You add object1's width to object1's x position. Compare that to object2's x position. If it is less, then the sprite disappears. Otherwise, it appears.
<br />
<br />That's the first step.

<br />
<br />At work i did some programming in my very little spare time.
<br />And i came up with this after a lot of thinking.
<br />
<br />first the flashing sprite:
<br />
<br />A button:
<br />
<br />lda ball3y
<br />clc
<br />lda #$30
<br />sta ball3y
<br />
<br />Im still a programming rookie so this made the sprite apear on screen but it also staid on screen after pushing A.
<br />tried to make it dissapear again but nothing i did worked(i suck <img src="./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=":wink:" title="Wink" /> )
<br />
<br />but programming can be done in many ways so i came up with this;
<br />
<br />B button
<br />
<br />lda ball3y
<br />clc
<br />lda #$ef
<br />sta ball3y
<br />
<br />pushing A  makes it appear 
<br />pushing B makes it dissapear
<br />
<br />first check wide+x ball 1 VS ball 2 x
<br />i came up with this
<br />
<br />Collision:
<br />
<br />lda ballx
<br />clc
<br />adc #$08
<br />cmp ball2x
<br />bcs NoHit
<br />bcc sprite
<br />
<br />sprite:
<br />lda ball3y
<br />clc
<br />lda #$30
<br />sta ball3y
<br />
<br />NoHit:
<br />
<br />It worked (i think)
<br />the sprite(the 3th ball) appears after the second ball is completely passed the first.
<br />
<br />Somehow i thought it would appear more then halfway past the sprite.
<br />But it is correct right?

<br />
<br />3.the collision

RMHjwK3RzA</a><!-- m -->
<br />
<br />i also read this.(and the stuf from here)
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />//If all the following conditions are true 
<br />if( 
<br />ballx+ballwidth &gt;= paddlex 
<br />&amp;&amp; 
<br />ballx&lt;= paddlex+paddlewidth 
<br />&amp;&amp; 
<br />bally+ballheight &gt;= paddley 
<br />&amp;&amp; 
<br />bally&lt;= paddley+paddleheight 
<br />) 
<br />{ 
<br />//we collided 
<br />}else{ 
<br />//no collision occurred. 
<br />} 
<br />
<br />
<br />So to awnser your question does it work? No
<br />
<br />I think i know now what was wrong.
<br />
<br />The x checks:
<br />
<br />ballx+w &gt;paddlex
<br />ballx &lt; paddlex +w
<br />
<br />if i keep this in mind with the balls and the sprites i made i see now that if its past the ball or for the ball nothing happens but if its in between it 'hits'and the collision code that makes the ball move the other way gets activated. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_idea.gif" alt=":idea:" title="Idea" /> 
<br />
<br />So now the trick part how to put this in code.
<br />
<br />-------------------------------------------------
<br />
<br />lda ballx
<br />clc
<br />adc #$08
<br />cmp paddlex
<br />bcc no collision
<br />
<br />So we loaded ball x we added its width and compaired it to the paddle.We want it to be &gt; or bcs to continue the collision check.
<br />So if its bcc we guide it to no collision code.
<br />
<br />the code runs further..
<br />
<br />lda ballx
<br />cmp paddle x
<br />clc
<br />adc #$08
<br />bcs no collision
<br />
<br />^^ don't know if this is correct coding im just typing this out of my head and on the go. I could turn this around by the way and load the paddle first.
<br />
<br />The most important thing is that i think i know what im trying to do with a collision. im checking if object 1 and 2, if there not before or after its a hit.

<br />You need to find a way to add 8 to paddleX and compare the sum with ballx.

<br />Correct.

<br />
<br />First i did it with the blinking sprite and it worked.After that i made a reverse code for the ball and it worked.The collision worked and the ball bounces back.
<br />
<br />The only strange thing is that the collision works at the very last second.
<br />The ball is in the paddle hits the last pixel of it and returns.
<br />Seems like a x check problem i need to fix.
<br />
<br />But im already very happy.
<br />
<br />Now i got a lot of work ahead of me.
<br />
<br />First i need to change my code to your nmi structure because it already crashes after i add a second collision code.(only background displayed)
<br />Too much too do i think.
<br />
<br />Ill ad score what i alread did before and worked fine.
<br />Make a nice background.
<br />Have a start screen and game over and maybe credits etc.
<br />
<br />So ill have m agenda full this month.

<br />That's really not good at all. How are you displaying the background? If you're trying to update the background all at once when rendering is happening, that would be why it's crashing. Bunnyboy's NMI wouldn't cause a crash unless you're doing a LOT in a frame.
<br />
<br />One thing you should do now is reserve some temp RAM. 8 bytes for now, you can always add more later. 
<br />
<br />Then make your collision routine a subroutine. It will set the carry flag if the collision is true, and clear it if it is false. Instead of acting directly on ballx, ballwidth, etc, it will act on the temp RAM.
<br />
<br />Ballx=temp1
<br />Bally = temp2
<br />Ballwidth = temp3
<br />ballheight = temp4
<br />paddlex=temp5
<br />paddley = temp6
<br />paddlewidth = temp7
<br />paddleheight = temp8
<br />
<br />To use it, you store the x, y, width, and height values of the two objects you want to collision check to RAM. 
<br />
<br />Then you jsr to the subroutine. When it returns, you can use bcc to branch passed the code that should happen if the objects collided if the collision didn't happen.
<br />
<br />This way you only type your check collision code once. Each time you change it to make it better, it affects everything that uses it.
<br />
<br />In that end it would look like this:
<br />
<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">lda ballx<br />sta temp1<br />lda bally<br />sta temp2<br />lda ballwidth<br />sta temp3<br />lda ballheight<br />sta temp4<br /><br />lda paddlex<br />sta temp5<br />lda paddley<br />sta temp6<br />lda paddlewidth<br />sta temp7<br />lda paddleheight<br />sta temp8<br />jsr collisioncheck<br />bcc skipbounce<br /><br />;code that makes ball bounce here<br /><br />skipbounce:<br /></div>
<br />
<br />There's a way to improve on that a little more if you use lda variable,x and ,y.

<br />
<br />1.I got the collision for 1 paddle perfect.Found the bug.I had a typo in the X position of the paddle.
<br />
<br />2. For the background i use the old nerdynight method of loading it in 4 parts,but i changed that in a variable system with high and low part of the background BUT ill have to search more info about incbin so i can use that.
<br />
<br />3. How does my pong look <img src="./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=":wink:" title="Wink" /> Well i have a nice background and 1 paddle works 100% and i have 2 scores displayed.
<br />The downside : the second paddle doesnt work at all even checked it with the sprite trick and the scores have a very funny bug.If the ball hits the left or right wall the score is added but the screan flashes and shakes for a second if i add background the zeroes come threw it,funny but a bug.
<br />
<br />Ill add some source code and video later.
<br />
<br />
<br />EDIT the temp ram is still abracadabra for me but ill look it up later .

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Temp RAM is just a way to use a general subroutine.
<br />
<br />Ballx, bally, paddle1x and paddle2x etc. can't be used to store an unrelated number while the game is running because it will mess up the positions of those objects.
<br />
<br />Right now (I assume) your collision routine works by comparing ballx with paddlex directly. This means you can't use it to check ballx with paddle2x or any other two objects without overwriting the values stored in ballx and/or paddlex.
<br />
<br />If the routine used RAM values that weren't required to be consistent outside the routine, it could be used for testing any two objects and you wouldn't have to overwrite ballx, bally etc. or write multiple routines that do the same exact thing (like checking a collision) just with different ram locations (paddle2x instead of paddlex for instance).
<br />
<br />You would just write the values needed to the temp RAM before you jsr to the routine, and that one routine would check for a collision using the values in the temp RAM. If you want to compare two different objects, write the different object's positions to the temp RAM before the jsr to the subroutine and the same routine will tell you if they are colliding.
<br />
<br />Basically, temp RAM is RAM that is only used for a small part of the program and doesn't need to keep its values the same across multiple frames. The same RAM can be used for a lot of routines, because once the routine is finished the RAM's values have already been used and are "free" again.
