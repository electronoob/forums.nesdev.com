If that threshold is a IC package, it's obvious which side is &quot;inside&quot;. But the word &quot;input&quot; and an arrow is equally problematic when we're talking about e.g. a card edge connector. You have to denote which side is &quot;inside&quot;, and then they're equally clear.

The RCA jacks on the side of the NES-001 Control Deck are thus audio and composite video <em>outputs</em>. For internal connectors, I agree that it may be trickier. But to avoid doubt, I've sometimes referred to signals on the NES or Super NES controller connector after the name of the analogous signal in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serial_Peripheral_Interface_Bus#Interface" class="postlink">SPI bus</a>. For example, the signal on the bottom left pin of <a href="https://wiki.nesdev.com/w/index.php/Controller_port_pinout" class="postlink">controller ports 1 and 2</a> is MISO (master in slave out).<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">Bregalad wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">Also I do not see what other purpose the arrows could possibly serve, except maybe current direction for analog chips.</div><br />Perhaps someone might confuse an arrow that points away from a signal source with a diode that points away from a current source. Occasionally, diodes are used to synthesize an AND or OR gate without having to layout, source, and assemble a whole 7400 series IC. This is called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diode_logic" class="postlink">diode logic</a>, which Don Lancaster's cookbooks reportedly compared to a well-known Disney* cartoon character.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">lidnariq wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"><div class="quotetitle">Bregalad wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">Easy enough <tt style="margin-left: 2px; margin-right: 2px; padding:3px; background-color: #3355aa; color: white;">-&gt;   &lt;-    &lt;&gt;    ??</tt><br /></div>And how do you make it clear what that means without there being a chip body there for the arrows to point relative to?</div><br />One possibility is not to include pin numbers nor the top or bottom edge of the package, making the &quot;chip body&quot; fragment in the legend clearly distinct from any actual pinout on the same page.<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">--|&nbsp; power supply&nbsp; &nbsp;|--<br />&lt;-|&nbsp; output&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;|-&gt;<br />-&gt;|&nbsp; input&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; |&lt;-<br />&lt;&gt;|&nbsp; bidirectional&nbsp; |&lt;&gt;<br />??|&nbsp; unknown use&nbsp; &nbsp; |??<br /></div><br /><br /><br /><span style="font-size: 85%; line-height: normal">* Before WDC's acquisition of Pixar, Marvel, Lucasfilm, and Twentieth Century Fox</span>

But I think tepples had another idea that's not bad either. Anything is best than a fake chip which is not the one whose pinout is described.
