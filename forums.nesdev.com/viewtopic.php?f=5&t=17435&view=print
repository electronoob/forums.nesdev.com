		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I've never owned a domain name before so I'm kind of clueless on how this all works. I've been told to go to Godaddy.com and just register and purchase a domain name from them. <br /><br />But I don't understand, how does godaddy then get and own these domain names in the first place anyway? And why do I have to pay to re-register the domain name continuously in the future?<br /><br />Also I don't have any experience making a website either. I took HTML back 15 years ago in school, but I'm pretty sure a lot has changed since then. I can drag and drop stuff all day long with templates provided that I have them. I've heard of such easy to use templates such as Wix and others. <br /><br />And how hard would it be to create a site where users can interact with each other live like an online chess site where you can play head to head against others in live matches?<br /><br />Would I need to hire a webmaster or programmer for this? If anyone has any advice thanks in advance.

The .com registry is run by Verisign, and the .org registry is run by Afilias, for example. When a user visits a site in .com, such as nesdev.com, the user's resolver connects to several servers:<br /><br />User to root name server: &quot;What is the address for forums.nesdev.com?&quot;<br />Root name server to user: &quot;For names within .com see <tt style="margin-left: 2px; margin-right: 2px; padding:3px; background-color: #3355aa; color: white;">www.xxx.yyy.zzz</tt> for at least the next week&quot;<br />User to .com name server: &quot;What is the address for forums.nesdev.com?&quot;<br />.com name server to user: &quot;For names within nesdev.com see <tt style="margin-left: 2px; margin-right: 2px; padding:3px; background-color: #3355aa; color: white;">aaa.bbb.ccc.ddd</tt> for at least the next day&quot;<br />User to nesdev.com name server: &quot;What is the address for forums.nesdev.com?&quot;<br />nesdev.com name server: &quot;The address for forums.nesdev.com is <tt style="margin-left: 2px; margin-right: 2px; padding:3px; background-color: #3355aa; color: white;">208.71.141.55</tt> for at least the next 6 hours&quot;<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">Erockbrox wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">And why do I have to pay to re-register the domain name continuously in the future?</div><br />It costs money for the registries to run the root name server and .com name server, and most domain registrars also bundle a basic name server for that domain at no extra charge.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">Erockbrox wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">Also I don't have any experience making a website either.
