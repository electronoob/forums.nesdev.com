The left pattern table has a bunch (33) of unused tiles, but the right is full, mostly from frames of animation of Donkey Kong himself. The right pattern table has the only alphanumerics.<br /><br />It's certainly plausible that some more effort could have moved things between tables (especially DK) such that there would have been room, but it's not immediately obvious whether it would have been enough.<br /><br />PRG also looks awfully full.

The first page (used for sprites) has a lot of unused space. The second page (used for background) is packed full, but it's also about 50% made up of tiles to animate donkey kong.<br /><br />For example, if part of DK was done as sprites, it might have freed up background tiles. Maybe you could save some additional tiles just by being able to use flipping for symmetrical parts of DK's image. Of course, this would immediately put strain on the available palettes. Probably DK would have to become the brown-yellow palette used for the hammers (or the hammers would have to become brown-pink).

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />There's 36 unused sprite tiles, and I think the game uses 8x16 mode, so it has access to both pattern tables. DK himself takes up the majority of the BG side of the table, but I noticed that there's an extra pose for DK that's unique to the NES version (when DK falls down on the last stage)<br /><br />The cement stage requires 8 tiles not in the NES version (2*3 frames of animation for the endpoints (left and right) of the conveyor belts, a tile for the conveyor belt graphics, and a tile for the mesh under the oil drum), and then it needs 4 sprite tiles for the &quot;pie&quot; and 4 for the moving portion of the ladder, unless you shrink the ladder down to just one 8x16 sprite (which they probably would've done because the sprite limit)

If so, they could've left him as a sprite, seems like effort to blink him out of BG, then blink him as a sprite, then blink him back as a BG.

The arcade game just uses a vertically-flipped version of his normal pose, plus a &quot;dizzy&quot; animation on his face. The NES version has him actually laying on his back and kicking his hands and feet.<br /><br />I also noticed that the scenes with DK climbing the ladders were cut from the NES version.

I doubt Nintendo would waste money, especially since the Famicom wasn't exactly popular until much later.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Since he changes back to background when he lands, and once there he's kicking in the air, that's maybe 20 BG tiles that could be moved to the sprite side trivially? Just that change alone might be enough to make the pie factory viable in 8k CHR, without any compromise to how the game already looks. (No comment on how feasible it is in PRG though.)

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I would be interested in a hack that restores DK's color palette depth from the arcade game. It uses a different palette for his face, where his eyes are white, while his body uses three tones of red/orange/tan. The white eyes could be done with overlaid sprites, allowing his body to go back to its original palette (though I'm sure something else relies on the palette).
