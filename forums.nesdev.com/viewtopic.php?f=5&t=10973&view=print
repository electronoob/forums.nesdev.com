		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Hi all, <br /><br />Ive been going back and forth through a thread to discuss ways to get past the technical limitations on the original Xbox not being able to output &quot;240p&quot; or so to speak. <br /><br />Mods, if this in the wrong place please forgive me. <br /><br />We have came up with an idea on how to get past 480i from possibly using a filter maybe. We started out with just drawing a black screen every other frame, but when using this method you introduce flickering like a projector on a crt-tv, which obviously looks like crap. <br /><br />We have moved on to this idea: alter the pixel data so it shifts the screen down one line every other actual screen update that shows data. <br /><br />So in theory it would be like this:<br /><br />Screen data at user set position<br />blank screen<br />Screen data at user set position at y+1 (shifted down a line).<br />blank screen<br /><br />My question to you experts on the matter is this, is there anything else we can conceivably try to get something with good results? Ive read and ill post up the link where a dreamcast dev successfully achieved &quot;240p mode&quot; using a similar filter trick with great results. <br /><br />The problem on the original xbox is the encoder needs to be hex edited with certain values to achieve low res and no one knows the values. I know the addresses of the registers, just not the values. The xbox has 3 different encoders, conexant (which states it does support 320x240 as its lowest starting resolution) focus, and then xcalibur. The first 2 are feasible but xcalibur is not gonna happen. The datasheets are readily available online, and someone who is well versed in this could prob decipher what values to use, but its over my head as its really technical and would take someone who knows what they are reading. <br /><br />Anyhow, i figured i would post this here to garner some opinions as some of you on here are light years ahead of me in this area and id love to hear anyones input on the matter. <br /><br />Thanks for taking the time to read the thread.

The Xbox, on the other hand, is designed primarily for output to an overscanned standard-definition composite, S-Video, or YPbPr monitor, though most games support an enhanced-definition (or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Xbox_games_with_HD_support" class="postlink">rarely high-definition</a>) YPbPr or RGB monitor.

X25871.pdf<br /><br />Now some interesting tidbits and facts i have learned from this conexant chip for xbox and other things:<br /><br />1. The vertical scaling can be disabled by setting the internal<br />V_SCALE register to 4096 for a non-interlaced input.<br /><br />section 1.3.18 Standard<br />Flicker Filtering<br /><br />Other CX25870 registers and bits must<br />be reprogrammed to generate different video outputs. The bits in Table 1-18 are the most important settings<br /><br />Figure 1-17. Noninterlaced 262-Line (NTSC) Video Timing<br /><br /><br />1.3.33 Noninterlaced Output<br /><br />When the CX25870/871 is programmed for noninterlaced video out via the NI_OUT bit, it always transmits the odd field. The FIELD pin will continue to change state on the leading edge of the<br />analog vertical sync. A 30 Hz offset should be subtracted from the color subcarrier frequency<br />while in NTSC mode so that the color subcarrier phase is inverted from field to field. The transition from interlaced to noninterlaced in master interface occurs during odd fields to prevent<br />synchronization disturbance.<br /><br />Table 2-5. Programming Detail For All Read/Write Registers<br /><br />conexantregs:<br />db 0xD6, 0x2E, 0x32, 0x3C, 0x3E, 0x40, 0xC4, 0xC6, 0xCE, 0xA0, 0x9E, 0x9C, 0x6C ; register<br />db 0x0C, 0x00, 0x48, 0x80, 0x80, 0x80, 0x01, 0x98, 0xE1, 0x8C, 0x00, 0x00, 0x46 ; 480p<br /><br />&quot;the only way to output 240p signal on xbox would be via the video encoder chip&quot;<br /><br />&quot;The Conexant encoder has physical address 0x8A, the Focus encoder 0xD4<br />(logical 0x45 resp 0x6a, one bit shifted right). Some APIs use the physical,<br />some the logical I2C addresses.&quot;<br /><br />Also here is the Dreamcast hack i think that i read. I think the DC can output low res modes so im not sure, but i thought this might be relevant in the case of the xbox here anyways. <br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.tototek.com/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?p=8688&amp;sid=09cacd0b11e8bea52c6d7716b574d8d8">http://www.tototek.com/phpBB2/viewtopic ... 16b574d8d8</a><!-- m --><br /><br />&quot;Doing some tests and making a &quot;pseudo 240p&quot; (by adding a black frame every 30th of a second) I noticed that higher and lower (horizontal) resolutions can look remarkably sharp even if a strong filter is applied. That way 1024*240p with a very slight filter can house most low resolutions almost the same as the real thing (though it would be great if true multi-resolutions are supported)&quot;

The poster doesn't say whether they're on a non-digital CRT or digital CRT/LCD/Plasma.

I thought the interlace would look flickery or at least look blocky, but I was wrong. In fact, I hacked a few SNES games (Super Metroid was one) to run in interlace mode since the scanlines have such a wide black space on my 27&quot; CRT.

I haven't done pixel-for-pixel tests in Game Boy Player but I think that's what it uses.

I had to zoom into the lower images to prove to myself that the right-hand one really had black every other row, just like the left, but was hardly bouncing. I take it the above images show the deinterlaced image, so that the amount of blurring can be compared more easily. Oh yeah, and vertical blurring is just what you want for images that look best with scanlines, as it lessens the blockification you normally get with scanline doubling.
