I would be interested in a hack that restores DK's color palette depth from the arcade game. It uses a different palette for his face, where his eyes are white, while his body uses three tones of red/orange/tan. The white eyes could be done with overlaid sprites, allowing his body to go back to its original palette (though I'm sure something else relies on the palette).<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=5314">mikejmoffitt</a> — Sat Aug 09, 2014 10:03 am</p><hr />

Since he changes back to background when he lands, and once there he's kicking in the air, that's maybe 20 BG tiles that could be moved to the sprite side trivially? Just that change alone might be enough to make the pie factory viable in 8k CHR, without any compromise to how the game already looks.

With this thread in mind, the most logical reason would be that they simply didn't have the room for all the data, and they would need to invest in larger hardware (maybe twice as big, I dunno what kind of cart sizes early NES games were).  I doubt Nintendo would waste money, especially since the Famicom wasn't exactly popular until much later.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=6132">OneCrudeDude</a> — Fri Aug 08, 2014 12:56 pm</p><hr />

Better question is, how did they make DK fall?  Were Mario and Pauline made as BG objects while DK briefly became a sprite?  If so, they could've left him as a sprite, seems like effort to blink him out of BG, then blink him as a sprite, then blink him back as a BG.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=6132">OneCrudeDude</a> — Fri Aug 08, 2014 9:56 am</p><hr />

There's 36 unused sprite tiles, and I think the game uses 8x16 mode, so it has access to both pattern tables. DK himself takes up the majority of the BG side of the table, but I noticed that there's an extra pose for DK that's unique to the NES version (when DK falls down on the last stage)<br /><br />The cement stage requires 8 tiles not in the NES version (2*3 frames of animation for the endpoints (left and right) of the conveyor belts, a tile for the conveyor belt graphics, and a tile for the mesh under the oil drum), and then it needs 4 sprite tiles for the &quot;pie&quot; and 4 for the moving portion of the ladder, unless you shrink the ladder down to just one 8x16 sprite (which they probably would've done because the sprite limit)<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=21">Drag</a> — Thu Aug 07, 2014 9:36 pm</p><hr />
