Ah, it's a good thing to know BSNES is that accurate. I knew it was accurate when it comes to video, but I wouldn't exept it to mean the SPC is accurate too, becuase as far I know Nintendulator is very very accurate for vido it isn't that accurate for sound.<br /><br />Thanks for the usefull replies.

Those last two can cause a very ugly pop if done carelessly (this is probably the "slap" you're talking about).<br /><br />If you Key On / Key Off at the same time (or within the same 64 cycle window), iirc Key On takes priority, but the channel will be keyed off 64 cycles later because Key On is automatically cleared, whereas Key Off isn't.  In either case, the end result would be abrupt silence because envelope is reset to 0 on keyon, then switched to Release on keyoff -- and there's not enough time in between them for any samples to become audible (keying on causes about 5 samples of silence to allow for the BRR decoder to get samples ready)<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"><br />Is the solution to key off a decent time before each key on the only accurate/viable solution ?<br /></div><br /><br />Pretty much, yeah.  Abrupt envelope changes will cause ugly pops, and the best way I can think of to avoid that is to let Release finish its job before restarting.  At full envelope ($7FF) it'll take 256 samples (8192 cycles) for the envelope to release completely.  So:<br /><br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">mov $F2, #$5C<br />mov $F3, #%00000001   ; key off voice 0<br /><br />; ~8192 cycles later<br />mov $F2, #$5C<br />mov $F3, #0            ; clear keyoff<br />mov $F2, #$4C<br />mov $F3, #%00000001   ; key on voice 0<br /></div><br /><br />Since keyon is cleared automatically once processed, you don't have to clear it yourself.  However that is not true for keyoff -- you must manually clear it.<br /><br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">About the DIV instruction....

I don't know accurate knownledge about the SPC currently is, but I've a couple of questions :<br /><br />- What kind of delay there is with key on/key off operations ? I've tried to make test programms, if I key on without ever keying off, I get an annoying slapping sound (I don't know about on the real hardware). If I key off right before I key on, on some SPC players/emulators the key on is ignored. Is the solution to key off a decent time before each key on the only accurate/viable solution ?<br /><br />- About the DIV instruction.... It takes 16 bit input and only 8-bit output. What happen if you do 65535/1 ? The result would sure not fit 8-bit quotient+8-bit remainder. I guess you only get low 8 bits of result but the real remainder (that's the only thing that make sense when using shift-and-substract method). What does division by zero output ? I guess result is always $ff and remainder is the original dividend (that would make the most sense again) but no doccument specifies that.<br /><br />- Is it possible to change echo delay during playback very quickly to get reverb ?<br /><br />- When echo is enabled back on a channel after being disabled, I suppose this only allow output from that channel to go into the echo buffer to be heard again later at lower volume. I've seen some SPC players/emulators emulate it so that as soon as echo is enabled past sound data is heard from that channel even if it was disabled before. As I don't see how the past data could go into the echo buffer (unless each channel has its own individual echo buffer, which isn't the case), I guess this can only be wrong, but again I'm not sure.<br /><br />- The processor have DI and EI instruction to enable/disable interrups. But is there any other source of interrupt than reset ? (I doubt reset is maskable). It's said that reset vector is stored at $fffe but I don't see any other interrupt vector mentionned in docs.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=38">Bregalad</a> — Fri May 23, 2008 5:32 am</p><hr />
