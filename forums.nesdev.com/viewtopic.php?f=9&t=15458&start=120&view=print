	</div><br />The only diference I noticed from this adapter to my other is the existence of this circuit:<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; __________&nbsp; <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; | C945P? |&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;22X (?)<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; |________|&nbsp; +---||----+<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;|&nbsp; |&nbsp; |&nbsp; &nbsp; |&nbsp; &nbsp;10K&nbsp; &nbsp;|<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;|&nbsp; |&nbsp; +----+--/\/\/--+---&gt; PPU A13<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; GND |&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 1K<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; +----/\/\/---&gt; VCC<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; |<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; = 1mf x 35V<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; |&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; NES cart Pin 35&nbsp; <br /></div><br />I think it's a CIC stun circuit, pretty common on old pirates back in the day.<br />I've put an X on the capacitor's last digit is because it's erased, also, the transistor's identification is not very clear.<br />I read what I could. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_redface.gif" alt=":oops:" title="Embarassed" /> <br />The capacitor (22X) is disconnected from the resistor on the transistor's side. If I connect it the game resets when I navigate through the pause menu.<br />I also tried to add a resistor that seemed to cure the reset issue on the adapter, but the only thing I got different was corrupted graphics.<br /><br />I also tried to take off some pullup resistors on the console's motherboard, but the only one that I could see a diference was the in the CPU's /IRQ pin.<br />Without it, the game didn't boot at all. So, I've put it back.<br /><br />Just in case someone is curious on how it crashes on clashman's stage, I've <a href="https://youtu.be/YgsbvWp8TVk" class="postlink">made a video</a> of it.<br />Hope someday I can finally solve this issue.<br />Thanks in advance!

Any clues on how to debug it?<br />Maybe measuting the tensions on the WRAM chip can give some clues??<br /><br />The only differences I can see between this clone, the other clone that works and an NES/FC schematics is that the clock generation is made with 2 transistors, instead of 2 not gates.<br />Could this be the cause of the whole mess??<br /><br />For now I have 3 games that crashes, any suggestion of some more I could try to see what happens?<br />Curiously the pirate Gradius 2 I have works just fine.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Again, I'm supposing a new possibility and asking if it makes sense:<br /><br />On the clones that the games works as in the original NES and Famicom, the clock generator is made using basically 2 transistors and a Xtal.<br /><br />In this clone that I'm having trouble it uses 2 not gates to generate it's clock.<br />Could this be the issue? Some thing going out of sync?<br /><br />Also, the PPU clock comes from one transistor while the CPU comes from other. <br />What's the other transistor doing to the clock? Is it inverting it or it's just buffering?<br /><br />Maybe I should try to replicate the original NES' clock generator as close as possible and see what happens...

	</div><br />At first it seemed to be the deal, I was playing Crisis Force and everything was smooth.<br />Them the game froze for about a second, but continued. Weird!!<br />But when I arrived at the part near the 1st boss where the floor opens, it crashed!<br />I tried Megaman 2, and got he same Crashman's crash. Gradius was the same thing too.<br /><br />So, with no other ideas, I just tried an original NES CPU I have from that flooded NES.<br />Intestingly, the games worked flawslessly!! Only Gradius is still giving me trouble.<br />By the logic, the problem would be on the clone's CPU.<br />I tested it on the other clone and again, it worked flawlessly! This time even Gradius worked fine.<br /><br />Taking a better look at Gradius' board, after supposing it was some kind of protection related to the diodes that some of original famicom boards use without success, I noticed the the 74'161 pin 3 is with a steady voltage of 0.8V on the Phantom System, while in the other clone the same pin gets a voltage of around 4,5 volts.<br />I think this means that D0 is getting pulled to the logical level 0 on the Phantom System, while in the other clone it's floating, as it should in normal operation.<br />I tried some pullups on this pin and all that I could get was a non working game, that was cured as soon as I removed the resistor.<br />Could this possibly be ralated to a bus conflict?<br /><br />Interstingly, there's an empty space on the board wich ressembles a 14pin IC and is like this:<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;O&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;O--Vcc<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;|<br />/ROMSEL--O&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;O<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;O&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;O<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;|&nbsp; &nbsp; <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;O&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;O<br /><br />CPU R/W--O&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;O<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; <br />PRG /CE--O&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;O<br /><br />GND------O&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;O <br /></div><br />The PRG /CE pin comes from the PRG epoxy ROM and is bridged to /ROMSEL. The other pins (including /ROMSEL) come from the cartrige edge connector.<br />I just could not imagine what IC should be put in there to possibly avoid bus conflicts, any suggestions?<br />Looks like I should try to cut the PRG ROM's /OE and add an inverter to R/W on it. Could this possibly solve the problem?<br />I just don't understand why this happens with an clone and not with another.  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_neutral.gif" alt=":|" title="Neutral" /><br /><br />I thing this is really weird!! How come this stuff have trouble just like this!!?<br />I really hope that someone that is reading this can help me to throw some light on it, at least the Gradius problem...<br />Anyway, the problems are almost all solved! And I sincerelly hope that this discussion can be useful to someone else in the future.<br /><br />Sorry for this big wall of text...  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt=":roll:" title="Rolling Eyes" /> <br />Thanks in advance.<br /><br />Edit:<br />Pictures of the Gradius' PCB.<br />Unfortunatelly it's not mine, but it's the same model.<br /><div class="attachtitle">Attachment:</div><div class="attachcontent">

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I read somewhere that circuit generator for crystal cannot be built using HC (CMOS) gates, there must be LS (TTL). Somewhere in time when I was tempted to build generator for my famicom i wanted to use gates due to less elements but I failed. The only trusting generator that always work is the 2 transistor one, from famicom schematics.<br />There are two transistors to buffer the signal and minimize interferences between them.<br /><br />Also, I see you use sockets. When I bought lot of CPU/PPUs from aliexpress, I tested every one (using ZIF socket). Almost half of them did not work and I put them into `broken` parts bin. After some time I got idea of cleaning the pins with sharp knife to remove oxidation and most of the non-working chips started to work.<br /><br />The nature of your problem sounds like somethink is floating and after time it get noise which breaks it. Maybe IRQ/NMI inputs of cpu are not pulled to VCC? Try also replacing PPU.<br /><br />If you have chip tester (for example TL866), check if all those 74 chips from console are OK.<br />---<br /><a href="https://obrazki.elektroda.pl/1191490500_1512612717.png" class="postlink"><img src="https://obrazki.elektroda.pl/1191490500_1512612717_thumb.jpg" alt="Image" /></a> <a href="https://obrazki.elektroda.pl/5191587600_1512612724.png" class="postlink"><img src="https://obrazki.elektroda.pl/5191587600_1512612724_thumb.jpg" alt="Image" /></a> <a href="https://obrazki.elektroda.pl/4232000200_1512612721.png" class="postlink"><img src="https://obrazki.elektroda.pl/4232000200_1512612721_thumb.jpg" alt="Image" /></a> <br /><br />Now the lockout - I would assume both are NPN with ECB pinout (for example 2S945).<br />It produces negative voltage spikes.<br />When PPU-D1=5V, T1.B = 0.7V, T1 is saturated, T2 is cut off, upper terminal of C1 gets preloaded through R1 to 5 V (so C1 preloads to 4.3V)<br />When PPU-D1=0V, base of T1 does not gets any more current and T1 becomes cut off, T2.B=5V, T2 becomes saturated, upper terminal of C1 drops to ~0V (C1 is preloaded to 4.3 from previous cycle), so lower terminal of C1 (and thus output) goes to -4.3V (but C1 is quickly discharged throught R2 and maybe because of breakdown voltage of T1.EB<br /><br /><img src="https://obrazki.elektroda.pl/5434013500_1512612811.png" alt="Image" /><br /><br />Here is simulation:<br /><br /><a href="https://obrazki.elektroda.pl/9051400100_1512614500.png" class="postlink"><img src="https://obrazki.elektroda.pl/9051400100_1512614500_thumb.jpg" alt="Image" /></a>

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Thanks Krzysiobal!  <img src="./images/smilies/Mfr_icon_homebrew.png" alt=":beer:" title="Beer" /> <br />It was a great help and I've restored the cartrige as it was, or what it should have been.<br />Not that it matters much, but...<br />I haven't test the output of the CIC defeater yet, but I think it should be just fine.<br /><br />About the problem on the clone, except for testing every individual chip (since I don't have a tester), I've done everything you recommended.<br />I've exchanged all the socketed chips, including the CPU and PPU. I tried many combinations of the 3 couples I have and got the same results. <br />However I didn't test the CHR RAM and the latch, but I think the chances that they're involved with the problem are abysmal, aren't they?<br />I checked the pullups. They're there, they're showing continuity on both ends (VCC and CPU pin) and they're 10K. Should I lower them?<br />About the clock generator, I tried again the &quot;spider&quot; I've built with the same results.<br />I also cleaned the sockets and the chips. I remade some suspicious solder joints too, but again, no deal.  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_cry.gif" alt=":cry:" title="Crying or Very sad" /> <br />I really think that it must be something related to the PCB or some bad soldering, but just can't find exacly where it is.<br /><br />Just by curiosity, I used TapeDump to dump the cartrige.<br />The NES file I've got ran fine on Nestopia and FCEU.<br />I think it's not fine fo post the ROM here, so, that's the CRC32 I've got:<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">GRADIUS.NES = c1c040bf<br />GRADIUS.CHR = de963bec<br />GRADIUS.PRG = 25e485b8<br /></div> <br />I took a look at BootGod's site and find no Gradius version with matching CRC, weird!!<br />Could it be an undumped version? I don't know how to take a look at goodNES database <img src="./images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" alt=":-(" title="Sad" /><br />By the title screen I think it's a japanese version:<br /><div class="attachtitle">Attachment:</div><div class="attachcontent">

		<br />
	</div><br />I used the same console that are giving me problems to dump.<br />For curiosity, I've padded the PRG ROM to 256kB, wrote to a flash and used my UNROM test board to boot it.<br />Except for the graphics corruption, the game ran fine.<br />I didn't played the game to the end either on an emulator or on the &quot;new&quot; flash.<br /><br />This is getting even weirder!!

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />So, what to try next?<br />I have some ideas, but I'm just short in time:<br /><br />- Totally disassemble the clone's board, clean, check for bad traces and put it back together. <strong>Very time consuming and possibly will take me nowhere.</strong><br />- Put a buffer on the PRG ROM's output controlled through /ROMSEL, in this case, i think the PRG ROM can be always enabled. <strong>Good point since I probably can get the part from discarded boards but again, a high chance of unsuccess.</strong><br />- Write a new PRG ROM and put on place of that one. <strong>Unfortunatelly, the smallest flash I could find is 64KB, wich will waste half of it if I do it.</strong><br />- Change the LS part to an HC part. <strong>I doubt it would make such a big difference...</strong><br />- Ask someone to design and make another board that fits on the case. <strong>Seems a good option, but probably would cost me money and I'm completelly broke <img src="./images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" alt=":-(" title="Sad" /></strong><br />- Buy an original oficial US NES. <strong>I think it's the best solution, but again they're not cheap here and...</strong><br />- Forget this clone, take its cartridge connector out and put on the other clone that works. <strong>It's a nice idea, since some games that have smaller edge connectors don't work properly on the other clone, also there's something weird in the other clone's sound path. Maybe it's missing a transistor...</strong><br /><br />I really don't know what's the best thing to do. <br />Please, share your opinions.<br />Thanks in advance!!
