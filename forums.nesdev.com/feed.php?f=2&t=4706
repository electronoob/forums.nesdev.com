Honestly, the graphics could be better. Some things are nice, such as the bricks, grass and characters (although pretty small). The brown area is painfully flat, the three-balled trees are really weird, and the rest is too bland.

I'm sure there's no way to read from the disk without 100% CPU usage, so it can't load in the background while you fight enemies.
