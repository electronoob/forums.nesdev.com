<br />As I said, the software is the same on both PCs, so if the Photo Editor mixed up the colors, it would do on both PCs. The only variable is the graphic card.

<br />OK, but wouldn't you still like to know which software is having problems with the video card? It might be the photo editor, not the emulator, who knows?

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Hm. But I assume that the Photo Editor uses GDI, the simple graphics output library. The emulator on the other hand uses the hardware-near DirectX, taking full advantage of the graphic card. And there's already a visible difference: When choosing a 2x2 windowed screen size in FCE Ultra, my own graphic card just resizes the screen as simple "nearest neighbour". My mother's more recent graphic card uses bilinear filter. If I want nearest neighbour resizing there, I need to disable hardware acceleration. So, if there is a program that works differently on different graphic cards while otherwise retaining the same options, it's most probably the DirectX application with its direct access to hardware, not the plain old WinAPI GDI application with its device independent BitBlt stuff.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Most emulator allow you to set your video mode to GDI, which should fix your issue if the video card is the cause.  But by looking at some versions (...) of FCE, some may allow it, others don't so you could be out of luck. If your version that you're using doesn't support it,  try another emulator that support GDI and see if you have the same result, that's what I would do. If GDI is not specified directly usually it "disable hardware acceleration" or something related to video memory, just forgot what they usually say.  If after that it doesn't fix your issue, there's not much we can do without being in front of those machine.

Trying another emulator would be fine if I had actual trouble with it. But it's something I just realized some time ago. And now I'm interested in an explanation. That's why I hope that someone maybe experienced it himself or can give a definite explanation.
<br />
<br />P.S.: No, FCE Ultra doesn't have a mode to change to GDI.

By "try another emulator" we didn't mean to change the emulator: we said to try another emulator to see if you will <strong> have the same results</strong>. That other emulator must at the least support GDI. From there, that should help you figure out if it's a direct-x/GDI issue.  Without experiment you will not be able to guess the cause of the issue. From only what you said, you can only guess it could be direct-x but without testing it you will not figure it out.
