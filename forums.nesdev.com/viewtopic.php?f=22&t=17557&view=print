On today's news there was a mention that Battlekid was localized for the Japanese market.  The artwork was even a collaboration with one of the guy that made the artwork for Guardian heroes on the sega saturn. <br /><br />here's the link:<br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://akiba-pc.watch.impress.co.jp/docs/news/news/1133581.html">https://akiba-pc.watch.impress.co.jp/do ... 33581.html</a><!-- m --><br /><br />In japan, some small company are re-releasing title for the snes too these days (multicart with 3+ games on it) but I'm not sure they are available  outside Japan though. It was games from Data east and SNK if my memory is good (saw them at the local game store).

As it's different from the official carts, it may not work properly on some of the consoles. It is confirmed to work on Famiclones produced by Columbus Circles.<br /><br />So they produce also Famiclones, and carts that may or may not work on consoles other than their own clones.

I may have read too fast.<br /><br />@Sumez<br /><br />It is made by a famous artist and from the look of it, they modified the game sprite too for the Japanese market (looks like it, I don't remember those sprites, it's been a while so..). They added some level of difficulty too.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />@tokumaru<br /><br />I never really played them (just the demo) but I do not remember the characters from the cut-scenes. It seems an improved bk1 version since it's written 2.0 on the title screen.  Now at last I can play it on my famicom but at almost 60$ that's a little bit expensive. I don't know how many they will have. Maybe someday I may be interested for the new box, which look nice.<br /><br />@Gilbert<br /><br />I don't really know their products so I couldn't tell but BK1 was an mmc1 from memory and it should be pretty common. The only clone I bought is a portable one and it kind of feel cheap, could break any time and the compatibility is so-so. I think I was able to make one of my devcart work on it but some games had issues to start because the contact were too old, damaged or dirty compared to my real famicom.

It would be a shame if you cart would have the same issue has the one they did in the past.  <br /><br />Do you know if it's a limited run or they will make a lot of them?

I did do entire playthroughs of the game and didn't notice issues.
