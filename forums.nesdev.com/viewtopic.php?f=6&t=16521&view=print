Stuff like manually reducing the volume values in the APU (after FamiToneUpdate was written) or something like that? (But this would also silence the sound effects.)<br />Would reading values back from the APU even be possible? And would this sound alright, if I change existing values after they have already been sent to the APU?

But a subroutine tacked on in sequence directly after famitones' updates should be quick enough not to cause a delay that feels wrong, i think. Maybe (and just maybe), an envelope going from 0 to near max will get an audibly different transient if the damp is delayed this way.<br /><br />If this is the case, you should probably modify famitone directly if the result is unpleasant sounding.

This way, you only need to add a simple macro call to the original file and everything else can be written in another file.<br />I tried it out and it works.<br /><br />O.k., we still have the problem that sound effects wouldn't be handled individually, but I guess I can live with that if it means that I don't have to fiddle with the rest of FamiTone and still have an efficient fadeout function.

You will have to cut it completely at some point.</div><br />True.<br /><br />But in many music engines, such as that of <em>Hatris</em>, a fadeout makes notes on the triangle channel shorter. This means the engine's internal concept of &quot;volume&quot; is used to know when to turn the triangle channel on or off. And in other engines, such as Pently, volume determines priority between the sound effect on a channel and the musical instrument on the same channel.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I guess you could internally treat the triangle channel as if it had a 4-bit volume like the other channels, and do envelopes, fades, etc. normally, but when updating the registers, compare the volume against a threshold to decide whether to enable or disable it. That'd make decaying notes shorter.<br /><br />As for a global volume setting (i.e. fading songs/effects), couldn't you use a 256-byte look-up table to &quot;mix&quot; each channel's volume with a global volume to get the final volume setting? Like, have the global volume in the upper 4 bits, OR it with the channel's volume which are in the lower 4-bits, and use the result as an index to look up the final volume in the 256-byte look-up table.

And when I want to fade-out the music, I would decrement the volume in each channel by the current value of the variable.<br /><br />I.e., usually my variable is 0, so the volumes are the original ones:<br />NewVolume = OldVolume - 0<br /><br />But when I want to fade out, I increment the value every few frames, until it has reached 15.<br /><br />This means the volume values will be reduced every few frames and eventually, all of them will be at 0:<br /><br />NewVolume = OldVolume - 1<br />NewVolume = OldVolume - 2<br />NewVolume = OldVolume - 3<br />...<br />NewVolume = OldVolume - 15<br /><br />(Of course, paying attention that a value that's already at 0 doesn't get decremented any further since this would just set it back to maximum again.)
