Thanks it worked!<br />The only thing is when I decompressed it to a wav file it gave it with wrong sample rate, but I didn't use any options. I'll try those later. Besides I really don't think it matters just so long as I tell the mml file what the correct sample rate should be for it to sound at the right pitch.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=4066">raygrote</a> — Tue Oct 06, 2009 3:25 am</p><hr />

Try the 81.exe from pineight.com instead, listed under "DPCM ripper" <a href="http://www.pineight.com/nes/#18" class="postlink">here</a>. It's compiled as a Windows command line tool, so it doesn't need any sort of dos4gw extender.<br /><br />Can you put snare.wav on mediafire or something so I can look at it?<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=9">tepples</a> — Mon Oct 05, 2009 7:53 pm</p><hr />

Thank you for the reply. However I still have a problem having to do with the converters.<br />I was using DMCconv, but when I try to change the sample rate, it goes down to 4.4KHZ, which is not what I want. Since the 81.exe thing looked promising, I was going to use it. I downloaded the converter from nesdev.com. In the zip file there were two files, 8to1bit.exe and 1to8bit.exe. so I copied 8to1bit to my C drive, renamed it to 81.exe to make it shorter. Then I downsampled my shorrtened snare to 11186HZ. Then I went into command prompt and typed:<br />"C:\81.exe" "C:\snare.wav" "C:\snare.dcm"<br />In other words I did it the same way I did dMCconv.<br />And got the following error<br />Stub exec failed:<br />dos4gw.exe<br />No such file or directory <br />I tried it with a 16bit and 8bit wav, results are the same for both. What is wrong?<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=4066">raygrote</a> — Mon Oct 05, 2009 6:57 pm</p><hr />

There are sixteen different valid sample playback rates, from 4.2 kHz to 33.5 kHz or so, and these represent various intervals relative to the original sample rate.<br />Say you have a C sampled at 4.2 kHz. You can play it as C, D, E, F, G, A, B in one octave, C, D, F, G, A in the next octave, C, E, G in the third octave, and finally C.<br />But if you record a B♭ sample, you can play it as B♭, C, D, E♭, F, G, A, then B♭, C, E♭, F, G, then B♭, D, F, B♭.<br />Sunsoft games use five bass samples to be able to play all notes.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"><br />I read that after using 8 kilobytes of memory, the bank is full so you have to switch banks.

Unless that snare sample has Phil Collins style gated reverb, it probably has quite a bit of decay that won't translate well to DPCM; you usually want to cut the original wave about when it hits -36 dB.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"><br />Fourth a little off topic, but when playing my snf files with DPCM using the not so fat so plugin in Winamp, there is a lod of DC offset, which fortunately not so fat so is able to elliminate.<br /></div><br />I wrote <a href="http://nesdev.com/bbs/viewtopic.php?t=4906&amp;highlight=vol+volume" class="postlink">this program</a> and ran it on a PowerPak to demonstrate that either my NES or my sound card also has a high-pass filter that kills DC.

Hi,<br />I am quite a newbe at this, so please forgive me if I am asking stupid questions.<br />I have been playing with MCK, which is a nice little program to write instructions to an .nsf file, using a .mml file.<br />Using a nice little tutorial I found, I am able to program the two pulse, triangle and noise channels. While I can get the DPCM channel to work, I have three questions about its limitations and how to program it more than I already have, and one question about a playback problem that I am having. <br />First, suppose I sampled a short sound, a synth bass G. In the mml file, is it easy enough to say "okay, this nsf is a g," and then tell it to play an f, c, etc as needed? If so can you give me an example of how this would be done?<br />Second, I read that after using 8 kilobytes of memory, the bank is full so you have to switch banks. So if I had a dcm file that was 100 bytes, every time I used it I would be adding 1000 bytes to the bank?<br />Third, Let's say I have two wav files: a kick, and snare and have converted them to dcm. The dcm files have a sampling rate of 33.4KHZ. The kick sample is 353 bytes and the snare is 1153 bytes. They work fine, but are they too big? Something tells me they should not be this big and I should probably shorten the wavs and use a lower sample rate in DMCconv. Any guidelines on what I should and should not be doing?<br />Fourth a little off topic, but when playing my snf files with DPCM using the not so fat so plugin in Winamp, there is a lod of DC offset, which fortunately not so fat so is able to elliminate.  I've heard that sometimes clicking problems come up with DPCM, I am having none of those at the moment.  Are these circumstances normal? Should I try other players?<br />Any help you can give is greatly appreciated!<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=4066">raygrote</a> — Mon Oct 05, 2009 5:43 pm</p><hr />
