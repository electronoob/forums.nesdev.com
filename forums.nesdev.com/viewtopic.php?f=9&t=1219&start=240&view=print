<br />
<br />I'm reading up on some newb-ish C tutorials so I can try something.  Not sure if it's best way to do it, but.. if the code is the same on the different regions, I (or anyone) could write a little program that would modify the seed values in the Tengen ROM then test the results using thefox's emulator.  If (and only if) the code is identical, then I think it should hit a match eventually.

<br />
<br />Why?  If the big established companies need people who actually care about the NES to do their detail work for them so they can make money, that's just lazy.

<br />Lazy makes money. Witness the flood of "NoPass" booting cards for the DS once Martin Korth published the description of the crypto used by DS Game Cards in April 2006.

Gotta have a bunch of cash to actually be able to make more cash, I know if I wasn't so near to broke I'd be producing all kinds of cool stuff myself.  I've got no shortage of ideas and even finished designs, that's for sure..
<br />
<br />But as far as crazy carts for playing lots of games, I don't think anyone will do a better job than what bunnyboy has been showing.  Stuff like that, Tototek, and VGWiz are all cool to me.  But I just can't see companies that make flashcarts for new systems in the same light, since they pretty much know and intend for 99% of their users to use their designs for pirating brand new games (which isn't so bad except for the part where they make money off of other people's work, almost as bad as the "recording industry").

Another idea would be DISNES, because the 'DIS' would obscurely mean disasembly, disprotected, dissolved, etc... and NES, well, I think it's evident. Also 'DIS' pronunced in french will mean '10' for the parallel with 10NES.
<br />CIClone is cool too, but there is already FPGA called cyclone (I don't think it's an issue however).
<br />
<br />Other than this, has the differences between the rabbit chip and the actual CIC has been discovered ? Without this, how would the difference between CICs could be discovered ?
<br />Also, I assume Tengen carts with the rabbit chip in them works only in the U.S. right ?

<br />You think there isn't a vibrant DS development community on forum.gbadev.org ?
<br />
<br />Bregalad: True, Rabbit is designed only for North American NES.

The differences between regions should be easy to spot though, if the number of changed bits matches the # of seed bits, then we know that's all that's changed (and we'd know what bits too).  If there's more changes then we'd know how extensively it had changed, though I'd be kinda at a loss at how to continue from there.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">Also, I assume Tengen carts with the rabbit chip in them works only in the U.S. right ?</div>
<br />
<br />Yep, they only released carts in North America.
<br />
<br />tepples: I imagined so, thus that 1%..  I have no idea about the quality/quantity of stuff people develop for it, if it's interesting enough to get non-development people interested in getting a flashcart for it though that'd be pretty cool.

<br />It is. Witness <a href="http://forum.gbadev.org/viewforum.php?f=20" class="postlink">forum.gbadev.org : DS Misc</a>, where numerous users of MoonShell (DS media player), DSLiveWeather (weather.com client), beup (MSN Messenger client), DipStar (cheat tool for commercial Game Cards), and other homebrew productions get their tech support from developers. In fact, we manage to find people who were attracted to the DS scene by piracy and sucker them into the homebrew scene.
