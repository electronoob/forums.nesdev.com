I guess I'll just try to find a replacement battery in a regular store, but I'll wait until my battery runs out even more because it's best using it to the bone.<br />I don't know if gaming shops sells such stuff, maybe I should just ask. If I don't find any maybe I'll just buy a DS, and if I really want to play the GBA that badly and the battery is dead, I'll have to switch batteries. Maybe I should also buy a GBC for very cheap as you can use normal batteries for it, and you can be sure it will work forever, unlike the GBA and DS where the battery needs to be replaced each so many years, and you can bet someday Nintendo will stop producting such batteries, and then the big pain will begin... Only GB and GBC games will still be playable.<br /><br />Oh, and also most of my GBA games are RPGs, so A/B button on the DS is not a problem, since for RPGs the standard buttons are still A and B on 4 button config. B and Y are for platformers, and I currently have only one single platformer for the GBA.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=38">Bregalad</a> — Wed Jan 16, 2008 11:09 am</p><hr />

I think he means he'd rather use Y/B instead of B/A (or allow them to be swapped, like Super Mario All-Stars or the Super Game Boy). It feels more natural to place your thumb across Y and B on a 4-button configuration, and most platformers over the past couple of decades have used that setup by default. Omitting such an option from the DS seems like a rather silly oversight.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=935">BMF54123</a> — Wed Jan 16, 2008 8:52 am</p><hr />
