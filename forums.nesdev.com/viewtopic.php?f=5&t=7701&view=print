<br />
<br />1. Castlevania 2 (nes): I didn't find the diamond weapon until around the time SOTN was released, so about 10 years later.
<br />
<br />2. Goldeneye 007 (n64): There's a control scheme where you can use 2 controllers at the same time. This I just found out about recently.
<br />
<br />edit: 3. LoZ: Majora's Mask (n64): The song of double time, half time, etc. I don't know how I missed these originally, but I remember hating the game at the time because I thought you had to do it all within the normal flow of time.

<br />
<br />I also missed a lot of things, including missable summons in my first Final Fantasy 7 playthrough.
<br />
<br />When I first played Mega Man X I throught the game was very hard as I missed all capsules exept the obvious one (dash), and most hearth thanks, and I abused a lot save states to beat the game. Now that I have seen the locations of all upgrades in walkthoughs, I can beat most of the game easily (exept the last boss which is still very hard).
<br />Same applies with Mega Man X2.

I cannot recall finding missable items / upgrades / what have you, but I have been finding techniques and strategies that I never got before.
<br />
<br />For instance, in Metroid I have become a huge fan of using missles as an "any time" weapon, I abuse the hell out of tue screw attack and I use common TAS tricks (like unmorph jumping and bomb jumping) to get access to power ups before I am supposed to.
<br />
<br />This has aaded greatly to my enjoyment of a game that I previously thought tedious. Now I can run the whole game in one sitting in just over an hour and enjoy every minute of it.
<br />
<br />Good topic, and a Ghost Busters II reference to boot! <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />

<br />Stopping kicked bombs with R in Bomberman 64. 
<br />
<br />Lots and lots of stuff in Game Boy Camera. 
<br />
<br />Easy Mode in Super Mario Land 2. 
<br />
<br />That's all that comes to mind, isn't a glitch and isn't generic. IE: Never found all the heart pieces in a Zelda game/never knew where a star was in SM64 etc.
<br />
<br />Edit: That multi coin blocks in Mario are timed after they're first hit. Only learned this a couple of months ago. Jump under one. Wait a long time. Jump again. You'll get one more coin and the block dies. If you had kept jumping beforehand you'd have got more.

<br />This item appears in Genesis,DOS and Amiga versions...
<br />However...in amiga it won't work on the pool under cementary.
<br />Maybe it has another use somewhere,or authors decided to cut this?
<br />But then, why they left Prince sign?You still can get it the same way as in Genesis version...

<br />Although I did play Megaman 1 and 2 with a friend of mine not too long ago and the way he went about getting certain items, boss order, and a few other "play-style" quirks made us start talking about the differences in how we each played.  It's always a blast seeing someone jump off a ladder or perform some trick to accomplish something that you never thought of before, then you show them what you do and they go "WTF??!!?"  :D
