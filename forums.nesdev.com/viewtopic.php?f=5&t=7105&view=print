<br />sexism?
<br />
<br />Women as a collective group have basically the most freedom they've ever had in the history of mankind.
<br />
<br />And historically, women a generation or two ago fought for and got abortion to where it is now, against the wealthy white older male minister types. Nowadays, it's more equal along the gender line. It was an interesting conversation listening to this explanation from a lawyer.
<br />
<br />As for sex crimes, look at what defines a sex crime here and there and let's compare apples to apples here. Let's also look at the percentage of prison population in general... The US is very willing to incarcerate.
<br />
<br />Complaining about public nudity? Jeez. What kind of impetus even brought this topic up?

<br />So true. If you believe everything you see on the news to represent what is going on everywhere on a daily basis you would think the world is coming to an end. The truth is most "News" outfits are now grouped with the Entertainment outfits and news needs to grab people's attention. So they really latch onto crazy one of a kind stories or find a few odd incidents and try to make it seem like an epidemic.

<br />European medias does too. I don't read american media so I can't compare, but they like to put as many scandals as possible everyday. In the end this ends up quite fun if taken to the 2nd degree.

<br />What the heck.
<br />
<br />If it is losing its population, it's because the birth rate isn't that high anymore since we don't all live on farms where you have lots of babies to work the fields.  People aren't dying in the streets by the millions, it's just that a lot of people are deciding not to have kids.
<br />
<br />However, you have yet to show any proof that America is actually "losing its population" in any significant amount.
<br />
<br />Also, I think your statement about nudity across <em>all of Europe</em> is an extreme exaggeration.  It's true that they're more open in that regard but you make it sound like people walk down the street naked all the time.  Also, correlation =/= causation; the possibility that there is more public nudity doesn't mean that this is why there is less sexual abuse.  (Is there less sexual abuse?  Cite this data...?)
<br />
<br />You might as well say that there are less guns in London because of all the nudity, it doesn't make any sense.

<br />
<br />I'm not complaining about public nudity, just the stereotypical American male reaction to public nudity.
<br />
<br />If some hot ass babe is walking naked outside, I'd enjoy watching her, but I wouldn't be interested in sexually harassing her.

<br />If reputation is your concern, here in europe, people in north america have the reputation to be all fat and to eat at Mc Donalds all the time. Also the reputation to be fat asses who never do any sport and use their car to avoid walking like 15m and that don't give a damn about climatic and polution problems or whatever.
<br />
<br />I don't know how true this reputation is, but that's it for negative reputations.

<br />I get that from them British guys all the time. No, not everyone is fat. Far from it. XD Lol, I love telling those British kids on Xbox LIVE how if we "fat" americans didn't exist, they'd be speaking German!  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt=":roll:" title="Rolling Eyes" />  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_lol.gif" alt=":lol:" title="Laughing" />
<br />
<br />Oh well. You'd better hope it's the dumb ones. 50% of the students in my high school, I couldn't see as hiring for a (ironic) fast food place. I couldn't do it. Talents? Yes everyone has talents, but there are very few legitament "smart" people here. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" /> Oh well.
