		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />FamiTone is an open source audio library for NES/Famicom. It is designed to provide easy way of adding music and sound effects into homebrew games and demos for NES/Famicom. It is not meant to be the best, the fastest, or the most powerful thing, it is pretty simple but it does the job.
<br />
<br />The library allows to create both music and sound effects using popular music cross editor <a href="http://famitracker.shoodot.net/" class="postlink">FamiTracker</a>, and then export them into library's internal formats. It supports all the standart channels of 2A03: two pulse, triangle, noise, and DPCM. Expansion sound chips are not supported.
<br />
<br />The library is open source and released into the Public Domain. This means you can use it for any purposes without restrictions: redistribute, modify, use for commercial and non-commercial projects. You could provide credits for the author, inform the author about your project, donate, etc, but nothing is obligatory, you could do it at free will. Obviously, the library provided AS IS without any warranties, the author is not responsible for anything.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I actually liked tepples's idea about a tool that would automatically create a source for few assemblers from a single master source. I'm thinking about something like this, but that would require to learn details about some popular assemblers first (voting shows that there are three the most popular), and I would like to work on other things now, so it goes to future plans.
<br />
<br />Another part of problem of support for other assemblers is that text2data and nsf2data tools generate assembler listings (that is needed to allow easy relocation of data at compile-time, there are absolute addresses in the data), and it has NESASM syntax. Currently you have to use Replace function of a text editor for other assemblers, and as general solution, I think a parameter should be added to these tools, so they could produce output for few assemblers.

<br />I would like the source in ca65.  I will convert it myself if I need to.  I'm not ready to add the sound engine to my game yet, but when I am I will try Shiru's first.
<br />
<br />Shiru, if I convert your code to ca65, I'll send my changes back to you.  I really appreciate the work that you've put into this project, and that you are releasing it with such a liberal license (commercial use allowed).  If I use your engine in any of my games, you'll surely get your name in the credits, and I'll return any changes that I make to the community.

First, sound effects converter was broken (altough it wasn't noticeable in the demo). Second, text exporter plugin was recompiled to work with FamiTracker 0.3.6, which was released recently. Third, short demo 'song' with DPCM (just few quickly made patterns) was replaced with actual song.

<br />
<br />Ported to CA65 today.  I just wanted to get this thing working, so it still uses the whole "=" format for defining RAM variables. For my own edition I'm going to switch that over to RAM segments instead. Just wanted to get this out there before I forgot.
<br />
<br />Also didn't port the code that generates from Famitracker, so you'll need to do some regex wizardry like I did to convert a file (or you could port the thing instead).  
<br />
<br />I stuck the notetable in a odd segment at the end near vectors and banktable.
<br />
<br />Thanks Shiru!

<br />
<br />I've decided that I'm not going to use a traditional tracker to make music in my current project, so I've put the FTM-&gt;ca65 converter on hold.  If anyone wants to finish it, I'll post the C code somewhere.  Its a single source file.

<br />
<br />That's really cool (supporting the syntax of multiple assemblers).  If  I ever resume work on my FTM -&gt; ca65 converter, it would also target Famitone using the syntax of those three main assemblers.
