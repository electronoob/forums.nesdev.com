<br />Ya I'd love to get a shot at the dog as it's been a VERY long time since I've played the arcade to do so and I doubt I'll ever see a machine to play it again. An NES IPS would be aces.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Sorry to bump. I'm unable to get either the VS SMB no-coin GG code, nor the combined no-coin and palette IPS, to work. My end goal is to make it work on the PS2 port of FCEU (which I'll be referring to within this post as merely &quot;FCEU&quot;), however I'm also testing in Nestopia without luck. The unmodified VS SMB ROM that I have works fine on FCEU, but obviously I can't insert a coin. I can deal with the colors being wrong, although I'd prefer they be correct. When I apply the IPS linked in this thread, it breaks the ROM - I see bridge tiles on the far left of the screen (seems like the same vertical position as the on-screen &quot;start&quot; button after inserting a coin in the unhacked game), and I hear a constantly repeating coin sound until I press Select, then the coin sound &quot;burps&quot;, the standard &quot;WORLD 1-1&quot; screen appears, then when the screen goes black the game goes silent and nothing else happens (this on both FCEU and Nestopia). The unpatched ROM works fine in Nestopia with proper colors as expected. FCEU has no UI for Game Genie Codes, and when I try to apply XXEAPXSX with a small tool that I found, it reports that the compare value doesn't match and the code is rejected.<br /><br />I even tried removing the iNES header before patching the ROM, then adding the header found inside the ZIP file linked here - results were even worse, FCEU just gave me a white screen with no sound or anything.<br /><br />Something tells me I'm just doing something wrong, but I can't pin it down.

If that's verboten to publically ask, then please edit this post and remove these last two sentences.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Thanks, I'll try it. The MD5 of my source ROM is b4e90b95a3e18f2bd79bbecf5009a28b and as I said, it otherwise works perfectly in FCEU PS2, and in Nestopia it works perfectly as a VS ROM.<br /><br />Edit: Same problem. Obviously, the problem must be the source ROM I'm using. It's tough to find iNES ROMs of VS SMB out there, as most of my searching has resulted in MAME ROMsets. Perhaps I should try converting one of those to iNES first.<br /><br />Edit 2: Yep, that was the issue. I converted a MAME set to separate PRG and CHR, combined them together with the header provided earlier in this thread, tested that ROM to make sure it worked as a VS ROM, then I applied your patch. It works fine in Nestopia (although it still brings up a DIP switch dialog), and I'm assuming it should work fine on FCEU (which I'm about to test). The only thing I notice is that the red color in Mario's sprite is more purple, which I do remember reading about somewhere last time I tackled this. Still, I'm very happy to finally get this to work <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />

Now, all I need to figure out is how to change the default DIP settings - the timer runs fast and I'd prefer it run normal speed. Everything else seems to be perfect as far as I'm concerned. If anyone wants the accurate palette, just take those hex values listed for Mario in that post and plop them into place in the patched ROM at $15E0. The only &quot;wrong&quot; color I've noticed so far is that the 2nd player start button is now purple instead of green. That's a small price to pay for an otherwise accurate SMB palette.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />So I've spent the better part of the night working on this.<br /><br />I get insanely nostalgic for old arcade games, and Vs. The Goonies was one of my favorites. I've done what I can to palette-hack it to run on a PowerPak/Real PPU. But I've reached the end of my personal capability here. Things that still need to be done: Copyright screen has red text, which needs to become white. And the controllers need to be mapped. Ideally I want it to be P1 coin is P1 Select, P2 coin is P2 Select. After that, Start is start and so on. I've put together a Vs. The Goonies patch in IPS to reflect the work I've completed so far. You need to apply it to &quot;Goonies, The (VS) [b1].nes&quot;<br /><br />If anyone can help, you'd be a personal hero!<br /><br />I may do some other Vs. Palette Hacks in the future. This is kinda fun.
