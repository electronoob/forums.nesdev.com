<br />You can do SRAM decoding with one <em>SINGLE </em>7408 chip :
<br />
<br />AND A13, A14, /ROMSEL and PHI2 together (it shouldn't matter in which order) and feed the output to <em>positive</em> chip enable pin, ground the negative chip enable pin and connect /WE to R/W and /OE to ground and that should to it.

It's written on official 6264 datesheet that whenever /WE is low, the /OE is bypassed, as all pins are input anyway.

<br />True, but you also could with a single 7420. And I don't know what you are talking about bus conflicts. As long RAM is only enabled for $6000-$7ffff, there cannot be any bus conflicts, since nothing else is mapped here.

<br />I was talking about preventing $8000-FFFF conflicts at mapper writes, not SRAM ;)

<br />A battery backup controller, there exist a couple of sort, with both positive and negative chip enable inputs (altrough those with negative seems more common).
<br />Alternatively, a battery backed 74HCU04 (or equivalent chip) would do the trick, along with the clasical diode/resistor circuit on the VCC of both the SRAM and the HCU04 chip. Someone who feels experimental could try doing it's own mosfet inverter, which should work, but I guess it would drain much more current from the battery as opposed to integreated circuit made for it.

<br />Here is where the extra /WR input can come in handy, since with a working /RESET (Phi2-diode-RC?) it should block writes at hard reset.

In some particular cases it may be the other way arround if both inputs aren't neigtboor pins.<br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">Here is where the extra /WR input can come in handy, since with a working /RESET (Phi2-diode-RC?) it should block writes at hard reset.</div>
<br />Yeah, that would rock, however it doesn't block the chip when the power is going down (which is the main source of SRAM corruption if I'm not mistaking), so another circuit would be needed for that.
