		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Huh, I never replied in this thread, probably since tepples nailed it.  But for old times sake, and since everyone has been forced to see the name over the years, I can provide a little history.  LOL @ at strang.png, that's great.<br /><br />Yep, was my old record label.  Mostly my friend Andrew and I, but we involved a lot of other people too, made what we originally called &quot;industrial trash music&quot; in the mid 90s.  We mostly used Fasttracker 2 (XM format), and Real Tracker (RTM format) before that, but we also had guitar, drum set, bass, and a cheap little Casio keyboard (that we used to like running through the guitar effects pedal).  We had just one live album, &quot;Live on the White House Lawn&quot;, featuring classics like &quot;The Fuck Song&quot; where the lyrics are just that word.  Never more than 2 instruments at time since we didn't have any mixer, just a karaoke machine with a couple inputs.  We mostly gave away cassette tapes, not sure how many, probably less than 100.  We had some CD-R releases, the later stuff was all Andrew, by that time I was pretty much only doing NES music with Nerdtracker 2.  There was some NES music in there, not a lot.  Recording NESticle audio to cassette tape, that was the 90's.<br /><br />I find it amusing that this has ended up on Youtube, but there's an NES ROM with a DPCM version of the story of one of our later, marginally more polished bands (it's Drew narrating, I'm accompanying):<br /><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opajf4xO2bQ" class="postlink">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opajf4xO2bQ</a><br /><em><br />in the year 1997, several maniacal madmen joined forces together.  this was the birth of dropoff 7<br />dropoff 7 started out with a casio keyboard, a karaoke machine, and a 1-string acoustic guitar, along with their microphone that did not work<br />dropoff 7 later hired an additional singer named Ian, but he sucked so they fired him and they kept out locked in the closet at Joe's.  Out in the garage.<br />dropoff 7 started out with totally shitty equipment and their music was shit, but they've evolved into a fine-tuned killing machine<br />after years of sucking blowing scraping biting they kicked ass kicked crotch kicked balls kicked everything<br />dropoff 7 is the fuckin' a<br /></em><br /><br /><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20010405193052/http://www.parodius.com:80/~memblers/dropoff7.htm" class="postlink">very broken</a><br />I haven't seen <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20010728160539/http://mem.tcon.net:80/users/5010/0951/DROPOFF.HTM" class="postlink">this</a> in a long time<br /><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20010715182942/http://mem.tcon.net:80/users/5010/0951/EMUL8T.HTM" class="postlink">proto-NESdev?</a><br /><br /><br />On our earliest tapes, we used to record stuff through my Soundblaster Pro to cassette, it was really terrible.  You can hear RF interference of the hard disk reading the files, and a constant EEEE sound that we called the eein'.  That was the singer named &quot;Ian&quot;.<br /><br />Listening to the older stuff now, it's extremely bad for the most part.  There's still some parts that I like or find funny though.  Very little of it ever made it onto the internet, the stuff that was online I just let expire.  Archive.org caught a glimpse of it, but the pictures/files aren't there.  I totally forgot about that icequake.net mirror, it's amazing that's still up.  I clicked on some links and some work, some don't, no idea why it's so random, haha.<br /><br />As for the name, I'll run with what Punch said, haha.  It's all stuff from when I was like 12-17 years old.<br /><br />It's probably about time to take the name down since it's pretty much retired, it must be really bizarre to see there.  I just don't really think about it.
