If a song is played in the context of a game, then the last sample of the last song would have left $4011 at some value, and NSF players don't know what value to use when starting the new song so that the user doesn't hear a big ass ugly click whenever a song starts. It's a similar principle to "clickless mixing" in some mod players.<br /><br />Another issue is that you might be listening through different speakers. Try running the NES into your stereo, or the PC into your TV.<br /><br />Another issue might relate to the NES's analog path, but I have no idea how to test that.</div>
<br />
<br />i've run it through my mixer and through a c64 screen.  Sounds best through the c 64 monitor, but still the same.. it just sounds more "classic!" so it delights my ears with its thin wonder.
<br />
<br />I'm sure its just how its meant to actually sound, vs. some emulator's author's decision to change the sound slightly to improve it. 
<br />
<br />it still sounds great!

The lines are usually black (they seem to act the same each time), and they appear to occur more or less uniformly...about 2 or so pixels from the edge of the 8x8 tile. This isn't always the case, though. Sometimes, the vertical lines flicker and are barely visible(i.e. during the beginning scroll, on the holes at the edges of the film, on Trevor's sprite, etc). Other times, they don't even extend all the way to the upper edge of a tile, and aren't even in increments of 8 pixels away from each other...or are even doubled up. Except for the two above-mentioned exceptions, they're pretty much all solid.<br /></div>
<br />I got a new PowerPak that exhibited this problem, so I was able to fix it.  I've uploaded a new version of the mapper.

<br />Wow, thanks! <img src="./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /> I've played through most of it, seems to work perfectly for me.
<br />
<br />EDIT: Removed reference to "issue" that was actually a TV artifact.

I'm going to open my nes up again and check what value i have my pot at right now, but its much closer now than before.. judging by the distance its turned, i'm going to gess about 30-40k, but i think 50k is basically the max you want.. meaning if i were you, i'd get a 50k pot (if you're into volume control) if not, lemme just find out the number.
<br />
<br />Will do a test on a separate RCA out for VRC6 tmorrow too.

<br />Does your mapper 19 do the sound channels or is that something in the future? I'm not even sure I know any games that would use the extra sound.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />It's very easy. You know the expansion port on the bottom of the NES? Keep in mind where it is, open the NES and remove the PCB. Remember to take care of static electricity, ground yourself to discharge before doing this. Don't wear static prone clothes. Anyway, after you remove the pcb you'll see the port on one side, well you want to look at just the opposite side. You'll see a number of pins/solder bubbles like in Loopy's picture there. The board has numbering written on it, I believe there is a 1 but it's hard to see, but theres also a 24 I think, which tells you the pin number. 
<br />
<br />Just look at loopy's pic and figure out which those two are.

<br />Heh heh.. actually, I've already tried but those games bugged out... there is something wrong with the mapper code that needs fixing first, and I haven't gotten around to it yet.
