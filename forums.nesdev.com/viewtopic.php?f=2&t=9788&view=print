Infects NESICIDE (As of Jan 6th, 2013), Nintendulator (0.975 Beta?).<br /><br />SUROM: FCEUX emulates SUROM very wonky/badly. Don't have time to figure it out exactly, but it doesn't work with my ROM. Seems to be related the number of times/order or writing registers. Nestopia plays the SUROM ROM just fine in every way.

Have you tried writing the expected values to both $A000 and the nominally unused $C000 and then making sure to stay in 8K mode?<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">MOS's book say the write is only asserted for one cycle.</div><br />It's still a read and a write from the same address, which might confuse the MMC1 even if it isn't a read-write-write.

Also works on PowerPak as far as I know as the ROM in questions works on PowerPak.<br /><br />And I set the MMC1 to 8KB mode. Then set CHR-ROM register 0 then 1 to 0.  Then the program is banked to bank 0 and the graphics uploaded. The register is always written 0,1 to the same value, even in 8KB mode.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Midframe state changes and PPU register access is tricky - especially if you want to produce exactly the same glitching as on the original hardware. For that you have to consider when different data is loaded by the PPU, etc., and I'm not even sure the exact timing that goes into e.g. enabling and disabling the PPU at all points is known.
