<br />I am using XVI32, But in order to put it in ASM properly via Text, need to use it via a BIN2DB or BIN2BYTE converter or something, as long it is not under DOS!

<br />Thanks, I may look at that to see if I can get any of it to work on my VC++ 2008. (I have both 6.0 and 2008. and pretty soon 2010 if I can afford it a few to several years more.)

<br />True, If you want it harder for anyone to edit source code, not just me, Anybody.
<br />
<br />That is okay for CHR and such, But raw data, Not so realiable to edit via an Hex editor manually. But it's a preference.

<br />I don't know what data is in question though...
<br />
<br />I generally incbin anything that's big enough and tedious to write and can be generated with a program (i.e sine table).
<br />
<br />I write a tool for any time consuming operation that can be automized... and they're DOS tools.......

<br />Myself, the main times that I'll use .byte instead of .incbin anymore is if I'm including constants (and constant expressions) into it.  I just find hex editing a single file a lot easier than scrolling through the source and then having to manually count out each byte to know precisely which offset you're editing.

<br />
<br />Not under 64 or 32-bit, If I was to switch back and forth from and to DOSBox: It's annoying! And Dosbox's Drive capabilities really suck in a way I wish I had my old DOS back!
<br />
<br />I wish I had a better, more accurate emu besides DOSBox, in which the speed is inaccurate. And whenever I use a 32bit app built for DOS in there, It'd crash
<br />
<br />The reason is: Palettes and maybe Metatiles

Command-line apps compiled with MinGW or VC++ are intended for the Win32 toolkit of Windows 2000 and Windows XP, and I don't see what keeps them from running under WOW64 on 64-bit Windows.

<br />
<br />It's made in C#, .net 2.0. It will work on any windows platform that contain .net 2.0 or higher.  Since you said you're using a 64 bit machine, I assume you mean Vista/Win7, that should not be an issue.
<br />
<br />You can define the prefix (.DB/.BYTE whatever), the number of byte per row (nesasm limitation). You can output to the screen or a file.
<br />
<br />Didn't test it much but it should do the job. It's a quickly made soft, nothing special.  Maybe it will help other people, who knows.

<br />
<br />It depends who ask in the first place. If the main requester who mentioned that no such tool existed or doesn't work or dosbox suck could have just said "it's what I was looking for, thanks!" or "No, it doesn't do the job, maybe if it could that... " etc then at the least then I don't see my time as wasted.
<br />
<br />I just felt like helping, even thought I don't have much time these days.  Just a quick venting I guess.
<br />
<br />edit:
<br />
<br />@dwedit:
<br />The file still exist. I didn't delete it. I didn't say that I'm removing the file because of the current events.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Hmm, I suspect this is a dead thread, but I did create a quick-and-dirty C program literally 2 days ago that converts the NES's 2BPP chr binary format into DB assembly data that can be fed into the ASM6 assembler for the NES flawlessly.  If this is the kind of program you need, I can supply it for you  I just need to check to make sure I didn't tie anything to my computers local environment variables real quick.  Oh, and I wrote it on my 64 bit vista and windows 7 machines, so you should be covered.  I can post the program if anyone will have use for it.  I didn't check, but I think ASM6 only accepts graphics data in DB format, so thats what I made it for...
