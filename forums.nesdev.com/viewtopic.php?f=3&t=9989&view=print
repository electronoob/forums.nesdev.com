		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Hi everyone<br /><br />I want to introduce my NES emulator called VPNES. It's written in C++, uses SDL 1.2 and freetype2 libraries, should be cross-platform but GUI was implemented only for win32.<br /><br />Right now it can run simple NES games. Implemented mappers are: nrom, mmc1 (sxrom), uxrom, cnrom, mmc3 (txrom), axrom.<br /><br />My program is not really precise and certainly not fast. Last weeks I worked on my PPU (rewrote from scratch again) and now gonna revise my APU (especially DMA). So later I can fix sprites timings. Maybe then I will try to optimize it a bit.<br />Every time I start work on the program I always end up playing NES games instead, so don't expect much progress. =(<br /><br />You can download the latest win32 build from <a href="http://rghost.ru/45053212" class="postlink">here</a>.<br />Project page: <a href="http://vpnes.googlecode.com/" class="postlink">http://vpnes.googlecode.com/</a><br /><br />Even tho it passed a year since I started the project I overcame myself and decided to ask your opinion.<br /><br />And yes, I started this to learn C++ language just like everyone. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";-)" title="Wink" /><br /><br /><br /><br />Edit: Please stop talking about penises, that joke is not funny.

Slalom reveals all the noob scrolling mistakes (even Bizhawk had problems with this in its first release), and Battletoads is a test to see if the emulator is serious enough to work correctly.<br />This emulator works great!  My Chu Chu Rocket game even worked perfectly.  I saw a few problems with Micro Machines, but that game is a real stress test for any emulator.<br />Small bug with Zelda 2's title screen: Reads to $2007 during rendering should advance the VRAM address (V) by one scanline.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" /><div class="quotetitle">thefox wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">I can't help but reading it as vpenis. That's all.</div><br />Reminds me of an old splash screen that I created for PocketNES, an NES emulator for GBA:<br /><br /><img src="http://pics.pineight.com/nes/splash/your_pnes.png" alt="Image" /><br /><br />Photo of a large collection of NES Game Paks, captioned &quot;how big is your p.nes&quot;? The implication was that someone who fills up a GBA flash card with a hundred NES ROMs may be compensating for something.<br /><br />So anyway, I ran it in Wine on Ubuntu. I found a few problems with some ROMs:<br /><br />Mapper 34 (<em>Deadly Towers</em>) does not work at all. Mapper 34 with no CHR ROM represents the BNROM board and its oversize variants. This behaves the same as mapper 7, except with normal fixed H/V mirroring instead of 1-screen mirroring. I ask about this because <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/viewtopic.php?f=22&amp;t=8514&amp;start=45" class="postlink">one of my multicart projects</a> currently uses mapper 34 (but will eventually switch to mapper 28). I also made <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/viewtopic.php?p=79826#p79826" class="postlink">BNTest</a>, a test ROM for certain behaviors in mappers 7 and 34.<br /><br />The builder for this multicart allows specifying custom reset vectors and preloading a specific 8 KiB bank of the original ROM's CHR ROM into CHR RAM before the game starts. This allows multiple NROM-128 games to share a single 32 KiB bank of PRG ROM if built properly. So I built a ROM with Thwaite and Lawn Mower. It's a CNROM (mapper 3) that normally boots to Thwaite, but a Game Genie code to change the reset vector allows playing Lawn Mower. This ROM works fine in FCEUX but has very screwed up graphics in vpnes. It's as if only odd addresses in CHR ROM are being used. I have attached the ROM.<br /><br />There appears to be no Zapper support. You can test various aspects of this with <a href="http://pineight.com/nes/#ruder" class="postlink">Zap Ruder</a>.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">Dwedit wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">Whenever I try out a new emulator, I always test out Slalom and Battletoads.</div><br />And when I try a new emulator, I try a ROM that I created that plays sampled speech through timed writes to $4011. If this ROM doesn't work, then <a href="http://bootgod.dyndns.org:7777/profile.php?id=697" class="postlink"><em>Big Bird's Hide and Speak</em></a> will be unplayable. I was a regular on one forum related to PocketNES several years ago. I'd test each new version with <em>Big Bird</em> and report that it was still broken, and I occasionally got teased about this choice of test case.
