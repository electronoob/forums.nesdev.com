		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />has anyone successfully extended a 72 pin connector from the board to a external location for the cart tray?  I have tried using a shielded ribbon cable and cat5 to extend the 72 pin ~5'.  Both tries netted me nothing but a solid gray screen.  power light comes on solid, turns gray if I have a cart on the slot.  w/o cart power light just blinks and shows a black screen.  I have extended the controller ports w/ cat5 and the power wires w/ 18ga primary wire and both work fine.  At first I thought it was a resistance problem for the 72 pin and that is when I re-soldered everything w/ cat5.  Now I am thinking it may be voltage drop.  any ideas?  thanks in advance!

<br />
<br />pardon my ignorance but is there any way around this?  Any way to do something in line to amplify the BUS signal?  Or am I likely stuck keeping the 72 pin on the board?

<br />
<br />well, it is for a demo vehicle that I am building, so as long as cost doesn't get ridiculous I don't mind spending the time to do it.  I have already spent ~$80 on ribbon &amp; cat5 cable plus 2 72 pins and about 50' of heat shrink.  Not to mention close to 20 hours of soldering and fabricating the cart tray into the arm rest and the controller ports and power switch into the console.  At this point I am so deep in I would rather not be defeated.
<br />
<br />Again w/ the pardoning of the ignorance, but I have looked at the pinout of the 72 pin in the wiki and am wondering if the problem is on all the i/o pins or just ones like the system clock and M2 pins?

<br />that is a good idea, I will look into those

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />well it looks like the old breakout box was for looks only.  From what I found the eproms were interchangeable on a board in the display and the came carts were just window dressing.  The NES board was right next to the multi eprom board and was connected with what looks like a "flat" 72 pin for lack of a better description.
<br />
<br />I think I am just going to move the board and cart tray together to a different location so I don't have to extend the 72 pin.

<br />But the Famicombox still used real carts.

<br />
<br />I made a partial schematic for a double-buffered CHR memory, it required 5 74HC573 chips and a 74HC245 for the data-bus (being bidirectional).  So a fully buffered cart may call for something similar to that.
<br />
<br />An EPROM emulator I use, with a ribbon cable/connector to replace a ROM chip uses 4 74HC590B chips between the RAM chip and the emulated ROM chip.  Using that had side-effects such as a partially glitched sprite-DMA, but but 300-ohm resistors in series with the data lines actually fixes that.
