		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />So... the sprite overflow flag doesn't necessarily get set when there are more than 8 sprites on one line, because as has been documented on the Wiki, once 8 sprites are found, the PPU starts interpreting tile index, attribute, and X coord data in sequence as Y coords for every 3/4 sprite records in the OAM after that (only 1/4 of the records then after actually have their proper Y coords used in the overflow test).
<br />
<br />  That said, it's also my understanding that the sprite overflow flag could even be set if 8 sprites, but no more than 8, were actually found to be in range on a scanline, just based on any random and unique configuration of the PPU's entire 256-byte OAM.
<br />
<br />  A serious question then comes to my mind, when I think of the sprite overflow flag's operation:
<br />
<br /> ***  Is "Sprite Overflow" an appropriate name for a PPU flag that bases it's function on a whole lot of complex sprite randomness?  Was this complex behavior intentionally implemented, or (heaven forbid), an engineering mistake on behalf of Nintendo's PPU designers?  ***
<br />
<br />  A further thought for consideration:  How can an NES programmer even take advantage of this flag (for timing), when even modifying a single byte in an unrelated part of the OAM _may_ cause this flag's behavior to glitch?  I mean, we 2C02 developers are skilled and talented low-level CPU mechanics of such temporal-sensitive environments like the NES's, but we are not magicians who can occupy and utilize the OAM in such an awkward way (how?), that will not glitch out this stupid little flag's operation of bizarre behavior.
<br />
<br />  Opinion:  It almost seems to me that the designers of the original 2C02 schematic made some sort of mistake when they implemented this flag's function in logic, because I can not wrap my head around the purpose of this "feature", as has been documented.
<br />
<br />  This glitch is similar in headache (but not as useless) to as how the APU's DMC DMA unit steals 3 uselsess CPU read cycles from innocently executing joystick code (however, if SNES pads were used instead of NES pads, then detecting a DMC DMA controller glitch would be as easy as examining the 14th, 15th, or 16th read bit from $4016/7 as a 0 or a 1, but that's neither here nor there).

<br />I was thinking more along the lines of using the flag for a stable, horizontal playfield split, but that's not going to be possible when I've gotta rearrange OAM data every frame.

<br />
<br />Well, I know I can use Sprite 0 hit to do that, but the basis of this query is to establish some community consensus for the fact that the Sprite Overflow flag is either hard as hell to depend on, or just not being worth bothering with to use in the first place for programming (unless someone can show me a practical solution, where practical means not having to restrict my use of the OAM to make the flag work dependably).
<br />
<br />Also, based on my tests with my own NES/FC R.E. KIT, I know of *NO* known way to synchronize the DMC timing with the CPU (not $4015.R/W, $4010.W, nor $4017.W), because even though the first DMC DMA fetch will occur 3 or 4 clocks after the write to $4015, the subsequent DMA cycles will occur whenever the hell they want to, within the DMC's timing base (it is more likely to be able to synchronize other NES hardware around the DMC timing via it's optional end-of-sample IRQ generation, but we can't do that with the non-soft resetable 2C02 PPU).

<br />
<br />Well I guess that this is one PPU flag that is much adieu over nothing, then.  It just really bugs me when a hardware designer implements a function that is absolutely useless to a programmer in nature.  I must be sick to care for such a thing.

<br />
<br />Now sprite overflow drawing wise is relevant to emulate since games like Legend of Zelda use it to do masking on the vertical doorways apparently. I'm guessing at this time they had not started using the sprite masking technique used in Super Mario Bros 3 and other games to make a sprite appear behind part of the background but not all of the background.

<br />
<br />Even without the bug, your sprite routine would need to specifically avoid having more than 8 sprites on a given scanline, because that would trigger your screen split at a time you don't want it to be triggered.
<br />
<br />And even then, you'd be wasting 8 perfectly good sprites. There are people starving in third world countries, you know. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" />
<br />
<br />Yes, it's an unfortunate hardware bug that renders the bit completely useless, but the NES/FC seemed to get along just fine anyway. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" />
<br />
<br />I'd highly recommend using sprite 0 for a screen split, anyway.

<br />Sprite 0 hits suck when you use scrolling. For completely arbitrary splits, it's impossible to always have solid pixels overlap the sprite unless you specifically erase/draw a solid tile at the proper NT location every frame.
<br />
<br />Anyway, I have found a use for the sprite overflow flag in my game. In order to hide vertical scrolling glitches, I keep background rendering disabled for the first 16 scanlines. Since the background is blank, it would be weird to have sprites there, so I have to mask them too. However, I don't want the different dot crawl pattern that results from having both the BG and sprites disabled at the start of the frame, so I mask the sprites with 9 high priority sprites (1 through 9, 0 is free in case I want to use it for a split) using blank patterns.
<br />
<br />Since those sprites are transparent and have priority over all others, no sprites will be visible up there. The sprite overflow flag, which will be set at the same time every frame, is used for detecting the end of VBlank, so that I can wait for the end of the blanked area and enable background rendering at the correct time.
<br />
<br />Yeah, it's a bit hacky, but is a practical use of the flag.
<br />
<br />EDIT: hehe koitsu already mentioned my rant about the usefulness of sprite 0 hits. =)
<br />
<br />EDIT 2: <em>Big Nose Freaks Out</em> (top right of the blanked area at the bottom) and <em>The Guardian Legend</em> (top left of the status bar) are examples of games that have solid tiles following sprite 0, but that's at the bottom of the screen, most likely after the game logic is complete. Doing that near the middle of the screen wouldn't be so easy, and would probably require a DMC IRQ. Moving solid tile + sprite 0 hits + DMC IRQs = too much complexity for something that SHOULD be (and CAN be, with mappers) simple.

<br />I always wondered what the hell that thing was.  I always thought it was some sort of speed or scroll indicator.  Should check that thing out in FCEUX sometime.  It looks like the sprite tile index it uses for that thing is $FE.
