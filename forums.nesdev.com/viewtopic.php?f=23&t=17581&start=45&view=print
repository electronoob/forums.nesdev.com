The problem there is that old unlaunch didn't empty the cache when loading bootcode.dsi (if your bootcode.dsi file contains the new unlaunch version, then the new version may fail to detect the cameras or run into other weird effects).<br /><br />What are you using for using for installing unlaunch? Some exploit like Flipnote or Sudokuhax?<br /><br />With some exploits it may be also helpful to insert hbmenu or wifiboot into the bootchain (ie. load one of that tools as boot.nds, and then use that tool to load the unlaunch installer).<br /><br />All of the above is assuming that the unknown camera warning is shown only accidently. The other possibility would be that you do have uncommon camera hardware. All known consoles have two Aptina cameras (with ID=2280). The four values in the screenshot have this meaning:<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">&nbsp; FFFF&nbsp; &nbsp;1st Aptina camera (usually 2280=the usual camera ID found in all known DSi's) (but your screenshot says FFFF=none)<br />&nbsp; 2280&nbsp; &nbsp;2nd Aptina camera (usually 2280=the usual camera ID found in all known DSi's)<br />&nbsp; FF&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;1st alternate camera from some other manufacturer (usually FF=none)<br />&nbsp; FF&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;2nd alternate camera from some other manufacturer (usually FF=none)</div><br />Going by that values your console would contain only one working camera instead of two. But I doubt that that's true (unless you say that your hinge is broken and there are some broken cables dangling out of the console).<br /><br />I think it's more likely that the detection went wrong; as happening when trying to upgrade from 1.2 to 1.3, which sometimes causes camera values FFFF,FFFF,FF,FF to be displayed. Your values are a bit different, but my first guess was that it's nethertheless related to the same issue.

From what I can see, the Launcher seems to enable that for you (and I'll do so in next unlaunch version, too). Additionally, commercial games seem to also enable the IRQ themselves (and should be perfectly legit if do that in homebrew titles too, ie. write [4004C02h]=4000h, so you won't need to wait for next update and/or want to have your program working like official games).<br />The exact official code in firmware v1.4E looks as so:<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">037B0F30 E1A04000 mov&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;r4,r0<br />037B0F34 EBFEAD1E bl&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 375C3B4h ;lau7_cpsr_disable_irq<br />037B0F38 E1A05000 mov&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;r5,r0<br />037B0F3C EBFEB43D bl&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 375E038h ;lau7_get_gpio_irq_config&nbsp; &nbsp; ;\<br />037B0F40 E3C00040 bic&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;r0,r0,40h&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;;<br />037B0F44 E1A00800 mov&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;r0,r0,lsl 10h&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;; enable<br />037B0F48 E1A00820 mov&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;r0,r0,lsr 10h&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;; powerbutton<br />037B0F4C E3800901 orr&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;r0,r0,4000h&nbsp; &nbsp; ;power.butt.irq&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ; irq<br />037B0F50 E1A00800 mov&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;r0,r0,lsl 10h&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;;<br />037B0F54 E1A00820 mov&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;r0,r0,lsr 10h&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;;<br />037B0F58 EBFEB432 bl&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 375E028h ;lau7_set_gpio_irq_config&nbsp; &nbsp; ;/<br />037B0F5C E3A00901 mov&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;r0,4000h&nbsp; ;mask&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;;\set powerbutton<br />037B0F60 E3A01000 mov&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;r1,0h&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;;set (none, aka clear)&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ; direction<br />037B0F64 EBFEB419 bl&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 375DFD0h ;lau7_read_modify_gpio_data_io ;/to 0=input<br />037B0F68 E1A00005 mov&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;r0,r5<br />037B0F6C EBFEAD15 bl&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 375C3C8h ;lau7_cpsr_restore_irq</div><br /><br />Touchscreen doesn't work, too (as far as I remember you mentioned that somewhere, too).

Or you could install v1.3 manually (eg. via hardmod). Or I could maybe add something for detecting your broken hardware, and let it pass to the installer for that specific situation.<br /><br />Might be worth opening the console and check what's wrong with it. But the ribbon cables for the two cameras are both connected to the same connector (P9), and (apart from the camera LED) both cameras are sharing the exact same signals, so the issue is probably not caused by a loose connector (as that would affect both cameras). I would be afraid that it's a broken ribbon cable, or some damage to the actual camera, ie. things that are quite impossible to repair (unless it's something simple like some metal junk touching the camera contacts &amp; producing a shortcut; or maybe a blown fuse, if there are any fuses in there). Quite possible that you would need to replace the whole ribbon cables with attached cameras and connector.

Maybe that helps, though I wouldn't know why, unless you have some different wifi hardware than most people. Maybe it's really time to look at the mainboard and chipset. Aside from different wifi boards, there seem to be different BPTWL chips, and different sound/touchscreen controllers.<br /><br />Well, or I could make a version with additional boot status messages, or with blank red/green/blue screens during the patched-launcher boot stages. That'd help to find out where it's hanging exactly.<br /><br />Ah, and did you try hiyacfw? As far as I know, that's also booting into the official launcher, with similar patches as in unlaunch. Does that hang, too?<br /><br />PS. I do currently have firmeware v1.4E on my console, and tested v1.4.5E only in no$gba, so I didn't check if v1.4.5E would hang on my console, too. But I guess a lot of other people have tested that and it's working without problems... If somebody has firmware v1.4.5E and unlaunch v1.3 installed: Could you test/confirm if it's working or hanging (when ejecting the SD card, or holding down button A during boot)?

Aside from different wifi boards, there seem to be different BPTWL chips, and different sound/touchscreen controllers.<br /><br />Well, or I could make a version with additional boot status messages, or with blank red/green/blue screens during the patched-launcher boot stages. That'd help to find out where it's hanging exactly.<br /><br />Ah, and did you try hiyacfw? As far as I know, that's also booting into the official launcher, with similar patches as in unlaunch. Does that hang, too?<br /><br />PS. I do currently have firmeware v1.4E on my console, and tested v1.4.5E only in no$gba, so I didn't check if v1.4.5E would hang on my console, too. But I guess a lot of other people have tested that and it's working without problems... If somebody has firmware v1.4.5E and unlaunch v1.3 installed: Could you test/confirm if it's working or hanging (when ejecting the SD card, or holding down button A during boot)?</div><br />Tested all those various things, but 1.3 is beheaving as the same way as 1.2, so cannot acess teh system nand, via unlaunch, or the sdnand via hiya cfw. There's still also the issue with games with wifi capabilities that are still not booting with b pressed, while the other are. Those games are pokemon platinum, pokemon white and yugioh gx spirit caller. the ones that boot instead are mario bros, lotr aragorn's quest and transformers the dark side of the moon autobots. Also i have a flashcard with wifi capabilities, with b pressed it boots, but as soon as i enter the wifi settings it freezes on a black screen.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Thank you! Good to see how that chip looks like for real! If somebody else is reading this: The CID/CSD values shown in unlaunch's unknown hardware warning, for this chip on the above phote are:<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">1D XX XX XX XX 31 36 35&nbsp; ;\CID<br />32 43 4D 4D 4E 01 FE 00&nbsp; ;/<br />00 40 8A E0 BF FF 7F F5&nbsp; ;\CSD<br />80 59 0F 32 01 2F 90 00&nbsp; ;/<br />80 80 FF 80 00 04 00 00<br />00 00 00 00 01 00 01 00<br />00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00<br />00 09 00 00 00 01 D0 40<br />00 00 01 00</div><br />And, about a hour later after receiving that values, I got screenshot with similar values from somebody else: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://i.imgur.com/embuZyj.jpg">https://i.imgur.com/embuZyj.jpg</a><!-- m --> (with same values as above, except with date code CC instead of 1D in first byte).<br /><br />That chips are almost same as this one <!-- l --><a class="postlink-local" href="http://forums.nesdev.com/viewtopic.php?f=23&amp;t=17581&amp;start=15#p222497">viewtopic.php?f=23&amp;t=17581&amp;start=15#p222497</a><!-- l --> discovered a few weeks ago. The difference (apart from date code) is the 6th byte of the CID being 31h instead of 30h. That byte is supposed to contain the chip revision number. The values are looking like ASCII for rev1 and rev0... although going by official MMC specs they suppose to be BCD values, with 31h and 30h meaning rev3.1 and rev3.0.<br />Anyways, they are different revisions. Ah, and one reason for mentioning those difference here is that people without Flipnote will often need to brute-force their CID before installing code on the DSi console, so the above will help them to find out which values they are searching for.<br /><br />Just looking at the chip photo, I can't see anything indicating the revision number on them. The first lines with &quot;ST, NAND02G, AH0LZC5&quot; are same, the next line contains some different letters/digits, and the last 3 digits in last line are also different (those might be a YWW date code with year/week values, but, if so, then the YWW value on the chip is several weeks older than the month/year value in the CID).

I guess it's possible that one of the cameras has been disconnected, I have had to take it apart once or twice due to some screen issues. The camera app does crash when I try to open the camera so that would make sense. I am trying to install using flipnote, which is already booting hbmenu which I am using to open the unlaunch installer.</div><br />Ah, okay, if the official DSi camera tool doesn't work either then it's apparently really a hardware issue, not a bug in unlaunch.<br /><br />You could install unlaunch v0.8 (which didn't have the camera check), I think/hope that v1.3 is a bit more stable when v0.8, but v0.8 seems to have worked okay for most or all people, so it should be quite safe, too. Or you could install v1.3 manually (eg. via hardmod). Or I could maybe add something for detecting your broken hardware, and let it pass to the installer for that specific situation.<br /><br />Might be worth opening the console and check what's wrong with it. But the ribbon cables for the two cameras are both connected to the same connector (P9), and (apart from the camera LED) both cameras are sharing the exact same signals, so the issue is probably not caused by a loose connector (as that would affect both cameras). I would be afraid that it's a broken ribbon cable, or some damage to the actual camera, ie. things that are quite impossible to repair (unless it's something simple like some metal junk touching the camera contacts &amp; producing a shortcut; or maybe a blown fuse, if there are any fuses in there). Quite possible that you would need to replace the whole ribbon cables with attached cameras and connector.</div><br /><br />I opened it and didn't see anything obviously wrong with the cameras or the ribbon cable so it is probably something wrong inside one of them or something. I just installed 0.8 and it is working! Thank you  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />
