(a velocity crossfade beginning at the discontinuity)</div><br />No, I wouldn't want to do that. Not in my game, anyway.<br /><br />The 2nd derivative discontinuity provides a slight feeling of immediate response to the release. Trying to soften this would take away that feeling, which I think is very important to have.<br /><br />The remainder of the arc above the release point already provides an &quot;easing off&quot; which continues in a perfect parabola from that point. The shape of the parabola is identical to that of the full jump from a lower height, so that part of it remains consistent for all jumps, and by switching immediately to it, we get the maximum amount of time spent on its familiar, predictable path.<br /><br />There's a balance between smoothness, responsiveness, and predictability that results from various choices. I don't think it would be appropriate for my game, but maybe you're making something that needs more extreme smoothness.<br /><br /><br />FWIW, I though the original version of Cheril's jump was unusual, but acceptable. The slow start to the jump is strange, but it doesn't seem to detract from the game, for me. In Lala, there's a few jumps out from narrow gaps where it might even be an advantageous shape. The most important thing to me is that the level design and challenges of the game are based around the jump, so I don't really understand the desire to change at this late point in time. (I do enjoy the discussion of various types of jumps, though.)

But if one is willing to do that, and if there's a good enough purpose, i see no hindrances. The max reach of the jump seems to be the same, which should make the window for new-upcoming layout trouble small enough to handle. In any case, i think it's a productive discussion.  <br /><br />I think you're absolutely right that the sharpness breaking off the trajectory has strong merits. It gives both a more direct sense and a distinct edge to the control; hence the if in italics. As for my slow-progressing-while-learning-to-code roller derby project, cross-fading in order to transition directional velocity in some maneuvers is something i view as important (because of how roller skating works), but that's another context.

Such boost is applied to vy in a decreasing manner as long as time passes during a maximum of 16 frames.</div><br /><br />This is why it has a strange jump curve, then. When an actor jumps, dy (or vy in your case) is generally set to an upwards (negative) value as a one-shot, and then a gravity constant is added every tick to slow this upwards acceleration until it eventually becomes downwards acceleration. To continuously boost vy upwards would drag the actor upwards, increasingly quickly. That makes sense for something bobbing to the surface under water, or if the actor has a jetpack or other propulsion apparatus, but for a jump it seems inappropriate. <br /><br />Some Virgin games for Genesis (Cool Spot, Aladdin, Earthworm Jim) jump with this same strange curve, while others (Lion King) do it in a more sensible way.<br /><br />EDIT: Argh, I'm a page late. Having an unusual jump isn't necessarily a bad thing, but getting the more typical parabolic curve might make it feel more natural to those used to other platformers. As others have written, it is a matter of whether or not it is worth changing the mechanic, then testing and adjusting the rest of the game to match.

If you wanted to expand on that, you could check for a moving platform collision detection to be true at each jump press, in which case the init position of that platform + centering offset would be stored instead of the actual position. Some additional playtesting involved, but that's much quicker than checking every corner for side effects of altered jumping mechanisms.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Well, it's *very* simple and it seems to work in the games I've implemented it, as it is a spot where you won't fall to certain death on respawn, and the timed invincibility grants no baddies will harm you, but it has its limitations:<br /><br />- As mentioned, you can't respawn on a moving platform. If you are planning for a segment in which you have to advance jumping through a series moving platforms, the respawn will place you far behind and this may seem unfair.<br />- If conveyors are implemented, maybe the respawning spot is not that safe. Imagine you jump from the edge of a conveyor in the last minute.<br />- You (as the game designer) don't really have control. It may result on unwanted / exploitable glitches, or unfair situations. Imagine you descend like 8 screens without having to jump, then get killed. Back to top! [*]<br /><br />@FrankenGraphics, I like your idea. I can detect if the jump is from a platform (in fact, I am using such detection to *not* register a &quot;safe spot&quot;). I could easily save the platform status. I could even take a snapshot of the values of every moving object on screen, and restore it alongside the player position. In fact, I think I'm going to try this on Goddess to see how it works.<br /><br />I always need to KISS (yet effective) as I'm coding in C and have to cope with the overhead.<br /><br />[*] This issue could be solved registering a safe spot everytime the player hits the ground. I could have implemented this but that would result in having to register the safe spot (much) more often, and every cycle counts. Maybe it's a fault in my engine, but usually you are registering a collision with the floor every frame as you walk.

If background solids/semi-solid surfaces <em>always</em> are on a 16x16 grid, you can filter for a multiple of 16 (<tt style="margin-left: 2px; margin-right: 2px; padding:3px; background-color: #3355aa; color: white;">and #$0E</tt>). Either option should save you a handful of cycles.<br /><br />A game can have different filters/masks for the Y and X axis if the level layout calls for it (not related to this particular game, i think, but one might want to have a different collision grid granularity on the Y axis than the X axis, for example).
