You can try to remove the suspicious chips and see if the sort circuit persists by watching the tension at the +5v line.<br />Try to test it quickly or you can have the bad smell again and something more can be damaged. <br /><br />To do these kind of tests I used to unsolder the +5v and/or gnd, but I was told that's not a good practice so I recommend you to remove the suspicious chip entirely.<br /><br />Good luck and happy father's day!:-)<br />Please, keep us informed of your progress.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=7094">Fisher</a> — Sun Aug 12, 2018 10:25 am</p><hr />

The CMOS RAMs (e.g. the TMM2115) tend to be some of the most easily damaged parts in a NES/Famicom.

The 2 ICs that heated a lot may be defective.

Alright, I did some testing and noticed a few things:<br /><br />When I tested the Famicom turned off, plugged to the PSU:<br /><br />- The power sub-board seems to work correctly, I followed the power flow up until the on-off switch and it was all ~5v.<br />- Just in case I checked if there was any voltage in the mainboard, but there wasn't.<br />- I checked the connection between the power sub-board to the main board and found the VCC cable:<br /><br /><img src="https://i.imgur.com/w4SekUM.jpg" alt="Image" /><br /><br />There I saw the VCC marked cable, and in the back of the board I saw that the two cables to the (right in the photo) of the one marking VCC are connected.<br />None was delivering any current to the main board.<br /><br />For now everything seemed to be okay. I turned on the switch and tested again, to see:<br /><br />- The 7805 is now outputting what seems to be exactly 3V. Not sure if this is the normal behavior.<br />- Now the mother board is powered with the same charge of 3V, by the three cables mentioned before.<br /><br />This may be okay, I left it turned on a few minutes and started touching the ICs. I touched them with the skin just above my nails which is a bit sensible. What I noticed is that some ICs heat a bit, some more than others, and some don't really heat:<br /><br /><img src="https://i.imgur.com/LW4QGyL.jpg" alt="Image" /><br /><br />Here I marked the ICs with dots to find them easier.<br /><br />- The blue dotted ones (TC40H368P) don't heat at all.<br />- Also both ones next to the purple dotted ones (SN74LS139N and HD74LS373P) doesn't seem to heat at all.<br />- The green dotted one (RP2A03E) and the one above it (RP2C02E-0) heat up a bit. Let's say they get warm.<br />- The purple dotted ones which are both TMM2115BP-15 start heating up. If I leave my finger on it, it burns a bit after some seconds.<br /><br />My knowledge on these motherboards is pretty much null, so I don't really know what is each IC.<br />How much heat should they produce?<br /><br />Then things got interesting:<br /><br />After maybe 3-4-5 minutes I started smelling a bit of heated up plastic. And smelling around, I found out that it came from the power sub-board.<br />- Then, I realized that the whole metal cover had an intense heat, that would burn my fingers if I touched it.<br />- I turned it off and unplugged everything.<br />- I plugged the PSU and turned on the famicom again after everything cooled down (10~ mins).<br />- I noticed that the 7805 was heating up really fast, heating the small heat sink and the whole metal cover that's in the power board. <br /><br />I don't have how to measure temperature, but it was really hot, much more than the ICs. Not sure if this is normal though.<br />I didn't want to leave it turned on much more.<br /><br />Do you think that the ICs are fried? In that case, it's pretty much not worth it to find substitutes?<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=8461">nnov</a> — Fri Aug 10, 2018 4:54 pm</p><hr />

Thanks a lot for the recommendations.

I bought this PAL SNES in Germany a few months ago, but all my life I've used USA consoles exclusively. My original consoles are back home and don't have them to check atm, but so far I have seen some pics of SNES PSU from different regions and seems that the NTSC (USA/Japan) output DC and the PAL ones output AC. Jeez.<br /><br />I will try to upload a complete report of the debugging soon.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=8461">nnov</a> — Fri Aug 10, 2018 3:36 am</p><hr />

@OP, I did the same thing!<br />I recently got a Famicom console, and I knew not to use a NES power supply as it is AC.<br />For whatever reason I believed the SNES PSU to be DC, Maybe there's a Euro vs USA vs Japan difference? <br />So after doing an AV mod I plugged in the bare board to the SNES PSU. <br />After 2 seconds a cap (1000uf) near the power inlet popped and let out a puff of smoke.<br />I will be replacing that first, testing further, and obviously using a more suitable PSU.<br /><br />*EDIT* I have replaced the one cap, plugged in a Sega PSU and it's fine! <br />Good luck with yours.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=9329">Addam</a> — Thu Aug 09, 2018 11:54 pm</p><hr />

Try to look if there's any voltage on the mainboard's ICs.<br />Maybe there's some power circuit problems, or you have some fried ICs.<br /><br />The most obvious test you could try to see if one of the ICs is fried should be the temperature test.<br />Just touch it and see how hot it is. If it's too hot it's probably fried.<br />But this test is just useless if there's no current arriving at the mainboard.<br />You can also try to do the diode test on the IC's terminals as described <a href="https://forums.nesdev.com/viewtopic.php?f=9&amp;t=16305&amp;p=203042&amp;hilit=diode+test#p201677" class="postlink">here.</a><br /><br />To do a better test you could find another Famicom/NES/Famiclone, socket its ICs and test the suspicious component on it.<br />Hope you can fix it!<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=7094">Fisher</a> — Thu Aug 09, 2018 4:53 am</p><hr />

Some Famicom revisions absolutely have a 1.5A picofuse but not in your motherboard revision (yours is an older one, and the daughterboard is original), so there's one less thing to check. The best way to troubleshoot is to follow where the flow of power should be from component to component, and figure out where it stops. If everything seems okay, your problem is elsewhere.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=7126">3.14159td</a> — Fri Aug 03, 2018 4:58 pm</p><hr />
