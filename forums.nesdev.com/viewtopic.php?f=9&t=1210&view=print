		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I've just cut the cords off of one of my SNES/Sega Genisis/NES adapters, and I hooked it up to a 9V battery, hooked it into my NES, and it worked! I could really benifit from this. Do you think I could somehow hook like the PS1 screen or something like that up to the NES, and have a cool play-it-in-the-car NES? Has anyone tried this before? I know Kevtris came up with the portendo, but has anyone tried like what I'm trying?
<br />
<br />Edit: I could hook that up to <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000CGCCM/002-0801798-2005656?v=glance&amp;n=172282" class="postlink">this</a> and I could have a NES in the car dude! I could put a fake case around the TV with the controller right underneath, and it'd be really cool! I'd have the NES on the floor, and the TV/Controller in my hands! This would be awesome! I should get this TV, and post pics of my "invention" that other people have probably thought of already. But if no one has, then cool!

If you wanted to power it for a reasonable amount of time, six AA batteries would probably work a bit better, though a portable LCD screen with composite input would suck the batteries dry in under an hour.

<br />You're lucky that the NES is one of the few systems (I know of) powered by AC. If it were DC, you'd of had a 50% chance of getting the polarity wrong. I imagine the NES is quite a power hog, so you'll need some significant battery volume to power it for very long. If this is for use in a car just use a 12V to 9V adaptor.

<br />AC is turned into DC anyway, most likely by a diode circuitry. Polarity can be bothersome or unsignificant in funtion of how the circuitry is made. If they use 4 greatz diodes so any voltage become positive, polarity is unsignificant.

<br />I'm surprised it lasted that long.
<br />
<br />
<br />Anyways, when we used to go on trips, I made my NES portable, and I had a TV to go with it.  I used a 7809 regulator, but on retrospect this is not needed.  You could power the NES directly off of the car battery since it just has a 7805 in there to get its 5V.  The 9VAC is rectified and filtered inside the console, and comes out to around 11.5V (Accounting for two diode drops in the bridge).
<br />
<br />A car has around 14.5V on it when the engine is running, and after diode drops this is 13.3V or so...  this will be fine for the NES and you shouldn't have any troubles at all.
<br />
<br />I had a 7809 regulator I used to power the portable TV... it accepted the car voltage in and output 9V to run it.  No great shakes.  I had it in a plastic box with a good heatsink on it and it was fine.

<br />You can run the SNES off of 9V just fine.  It runs the input voltage through a 7805 to get the 5V that runs everything else.  There might be a few analog bits that run on the input voltage, but I highly doubt it.
