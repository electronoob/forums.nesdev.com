		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Hello guys,<br /><br />I need somes help to guide me how to create my own multicart, I have couples of questions and I didn't find anything on google.<br /><br />I have basic knowledge of asm on x86. I would like to put my favorites top 100 games on the same catdridge with my own selection menu.<br /><br />1. my first step would be to create multicart rom and once it is finished I would like to copy it onto a catdridge. It is a good approach ?<br />2. Do I need a special catdridge or if I can take any of my old nes catdridge and overwrite it ?<br />3. Where can I buy a device to write my rom onto a catdridge, there is a usb device compatible with windows 7/10 somewhere ?<br /><br />4. how do I create a menu selection ? I would like to create something fancy with a background. I saw a multicart on youtube 150 in 1 with a nice background and each select have a preview of the game in a little square.<br /><br />Does someone have a link to a multicart menu selection source code that I can play with to customize it instead of create one from scratch ?<br /><br />5. how do I calculate the limit of the games I would like to put into the same rom ? I read about mappers but I am a bit confused, does someone have a good tutorial for that ?<br /><br />thanks <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />

There's no shortcut or out of the box solution if you want to make your own nes compatible interface + multiloader. <br /><br />You need to:<br />-read up on mappers and their hardware limits<br />-read up on the architecture specific to the NES<br />-code a lot of little programs for the sake of learning each building block, such as:<br />--controller input<br />--feeding the ppu<br />--segments and object linking<br />-learn how to do pixel art for the &quot;thumbnails&quot;<br /><br />writing to a cartridge is the easy part once you know all this. Which can't be explained in one single thread. It's a process that may take you  maybe a year if you're determined. Reproduction discussions have a specific subforum (this one is for game/demo/tool development) - you might find some leads there.<br /><br />edit: corrected typos

The internals was just a run of the mill computer and monitor running a special emulator.<br /><br />Similarly, I can attach my laptop to my regular TV, and I recently purchased a NES controller to USB connector from retrousb. It feels and plays just like a real NES console, just running an emulator.<br /><br />Those 2 options would be much easier than your plan.

Supported mappers are NROM (0), CNROM (3), UNROM (2), UNROM &quot;Crazy Climber&quot; variant (180), BNROM (34), and AOROM (7). But you might need to make a special request from Paul at Infinite NES Lives for a cart with such large PRG ROM.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />&quot;Just replacing the contents&quot; is the hard part.<br /><br />1- Most of those N-in-1 carts actually use a so-called &quot;mask&quot; ROM, which you can't put new data in<br />2- Many of those &quot;large number&quot; in 1 carts don't actually contain the named number of games but something fewer.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />A mapper (sometimes specific ones are called other things, like nintendo terminology/branding โmemory management controllerโ - MMC - or the konami equivalent term virtual ROM controller - VRC) is any device of any kind that so to speak shifts what part of a larger ROM or RAM can be seen through the tiny rom space/address window. This is allowing the console to access larger programs/data than the machine was designed for. All mappers are part of the cartridge PCB but not all cartridges have a mapper. Furthermore, you can still never see the whole program at the exact same time if it is larger than the address window, but rather portions of it. A portion is called a bank. Banks are โshiftedโ in and out of view.<br /><br />The term is unfortunately used off-handedly in emulator culture where it first and foremost is a term attached to what kind of virtual PCB the ROM image is supposed to be โsocketedโ into. Which can be confusing.<br /><br />==<br />edit: corrected typos

A mapper can be comprised of either discrete logic components or an ASIC (application specific integrated circuit: in other words a chip). Furthermore, programmable devices can be used today to replace the original, out-of-production chips, which is why more advanced mappers can be reproduced.
