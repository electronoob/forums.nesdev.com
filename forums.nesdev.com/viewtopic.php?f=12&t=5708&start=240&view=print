It also had a title that seemed to go too far, but the final byte of the title was $20 which just luckily agreed with the PowerPAK loader. 
<br />
<br />Bunnyboy, is there any chance you might make the loader support actually using a Game Doctor SF header for mapping? Or does it already? Seems that could help the problem.

Of course you could always say "download a verified set" but most people simply won't.  The issues will still appear if people use headerless ROMs so that isn't a full fix either.  GD3 header also doesn't include info like the battery.

I just checked on Super Probotector (European title of Contra 3), which goes with that value as well. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />BTW, I found another game where the same issue arises: Super Adventure Island (US version only). All you PowerPak users, change the byte at $7fd5 (on a headerless ROM) to $20, and you'll be fine. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /> The European version of the game is not affected.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">bunnyboy wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">All file headers are completely ignored.</div>
<br />Are you sure about this? I encounter an error message "Bad header or filesize, copying again" once in a while. It doesn't affect gameplay (after "copying again", the game loads fine), but deleting the copier header from the ROM or overwriting it with valid Super WildCard header info makes the error vanish. Strange indeed. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_question.gif" alt=":?:" title="Question" /> <img src="./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" />

<br />This game appears to be 50/60 Hz protected in such a way that it doesn't present you with an error message when run in 50 Hz mode (as most other protected NTSC games do), but instead only shows a black screen. Thus, you'd have to remove the protections from the ROM using SNESTool, killem or something similar.

<br />
<br />Yeah, that's one common problem with those store. The first one as a store in Tokyo (but mostly in Osaka) and I go once in a while. But since there seems to be a protection, you wouldn't be able to run the original unfortunately.

<br />
<br />Super Mario World: At final castle , whe you hit Bowser, he starts to turning around, but he disappears while he's being stunned, after that, he appears normaly, this happens too with some on his children's castles.
<br />
<br />On F-Zero, roadmap is distorted, unplayable, also son Super Mario Kart.
<br />
<br />Jurassic Park 1 at intro the Island doesn't show correctly and Dr Grant gets stuck on a corner.
<br />
<br />Capcom's Soccer Shootout, goalkeeper's area is awfully distorted.
<br />
<br />Art of Fighting - before it says Fight when Ryo/Robert hop screen got black then normalizes itself.
<br />
<br />Donkey Kong Country - Intro, Logo Layering problem, At Misty Mine too.
<br />
<br />What's your layering/gaming experience guys?

<br />anyone have any clue whats going on here? i bought it with the CF card to insure compatibility, but after reading here i thought that it might be bad. so i went and bought another one, and its giving tme the same errors. it does this regardless of if i use DMA=1 or DMA=0, on either card.
<br />
<br />
<br />edit: i've tried this on the 1.02, 1.03, and 1.03b mappers with both cards and both DMA's with no luck
