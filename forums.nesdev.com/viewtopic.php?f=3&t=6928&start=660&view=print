(Kinda surprised there's no bootgod entry for it?)<br /><br />Edit: oh, sorry, I didn't notice the &quot;CH&quot;, but it looks like for the Chinese hack version it ends up in the wrong mirroring mode instead of single screen 0 for the game map, on FCEUX at least.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Game seems to operate correctly in Nestopia when emulated as mapper 195 if save ram has been deleted, and not with 4-screen mirroring.<br /><br />Looks like Nestopia treats Waixing's MMC3 clones' mirroring register differently. Rather than just using the LSB to select V/H, it instead uses the two LSBs to select V/H/0/1. I bet that's what's happening here.
