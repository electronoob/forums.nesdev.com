		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />For the past month I had switch from programing for the main category to instead an app entry.<br /><br />Just a few days ago I was about to give up, but then I saw that there's only 8 registered contestants, and it would be at least a 20% dropout rate if I were to fail. So I'm now aiming for implementing only 1 or 2 modes out of the planned 8. After the compo, I hope I can then finish the other 6 by the time the final multi-cart ROM is assembled.

I could make up a demo with only a (finished) level playable, but then it'd be quite weak compared to finished games.

I submitted one version, but the multicart used <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/viewtopic.php?p=87291#p87291" class="postlink">a later version</a> with mouse support, improved music, practice mode, and tweaks to late game balance.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Maybe 3 months wasn't long enough? This will be something to consider for upcoming competitions.  The 2011 competition was extended another month because there were hardly any submissions, and it wouldn't be fair to do it this time around.<br /><br />I would encourage people to submit things in any state for judging (even if you just want to submit a demo). Like Tepples said, although we can only judge you on what was submitted by the closing date, any improvements and bugfixes can and will gladly be put on the multi-cart.

If only I had the focus I'm having now at the start of the competition.<br /><br />Good luck to everyone! <img src="./images/smilies/Mfr_icon_homebrew.png" alt=":beer:" title="Beer" />

I will post whatever is submitted to the website so there is a consolidated location to download the competition entries.  You can submit a newer version whenever you would like and I will replace it on the website.  Either that or I can add a link to your thread here instead of hosting the file on the nesdevcompo site, as long as you use the forums built in attachment feature and not link to an external website. I don't want to deal with broken links in the future.
