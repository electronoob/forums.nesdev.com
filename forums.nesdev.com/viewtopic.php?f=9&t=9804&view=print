		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I bought a Solstice cart (ANROM) and i modified it in order to work with 256k eeproms (some scavenged w27c020 that works perfectly fine) connecting the A17 pin of the prg to the 12 pin of of the 161 and the D2 one to the 5 pin, and a bit of rewiring for the prg rom. It runs Cabal perfectly fine (you only need tha A17-12pin connection for Cabal to run on an anrom) with no glitches. But when i try to run Battletoads this is what i'm ending up with:<br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oi66BOO4-0s&amp;feature=youtu.be">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oi66BOO4 ... e=youtu.be</a><!-- m --><br /><br /><br />Notice the graphic glitches and the fact that the game freezes just like when runing a game that needs aditional ram (Dracula for example) on a cart with the ram chip not connected. What should i do?

None of the commercial games should rely on bus conflicts to function. Atleast no one has ever pointed one out.

There is probably several examples like this.
