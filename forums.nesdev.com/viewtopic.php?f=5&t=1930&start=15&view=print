<br />That doesn't sound productive at all. I can't code while listening to music because of this very reason. I only listen to music that I REALLY like, so there isn't any kind of music I can put just to set the mood or something, because I end up paying to much attention to it, and none to coding.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Maybe I just listen to songs so many times that they become background music to me eventually. Songs with less-prominent melodies could also be useful, like house music. Sometimes I listen to music while coding and I think it helps by influencing my mood, giving me enthusiasm and making me less prone to distraction. I hardly ever listen to music with vocals, since I usually find it really distracting unless the vocals are mindless.

<br />Me too, I NEVER listen any music with vocals.
<br />If I need quite music, I like listen Nakano's song in Final Fantasy X. They are without melody, and just reflect some think of ambiance. It works pretty well to listen while coding. Uematsu's music is more suited to listen just while playing or doing nothing special. But my favourite sound tracks remains Secret of Mana and Chrono Trigger.

<br />I know, most people are like this. I, however, am VERY connected to the music I like. Even instrumental (non-vocal) music can never pass for simple background music to me. If they are game, anime or movie OST's, I often start to think about the scenes/parts that used that music, and then I start remembering and imagining things instead of thinking about the logic in my programs. It's a deficiency, I know.

<br />I'll be like that with or without music, so I just chose with so that when I'm not thinking about what I'm doing I think about the music, instead of thinking about anything else.
<br />And for Video Game music, if you listen some quiet town music or such, this is really good to listen, relax and it doesn't perturb. Listen some other kind of music such as more dynamic ones could change the thing, though.

<br />
<br />
<br />It doesn't sound productive, but I am just like a zombie coding away. I get alot done, but I don't really know how. I feel like I'd be distracted, but I actually feel very motivated when listening to the music. I especially can't listen to music with vocals, though. I start singing along, and then I see myself closing my asm file, and I just quit working on my game. It's bad if I do that.

<br />
<br />I understand that.  The band Napalm Death is a good example, I know the lyrics to some of their songs (often very thoughtful and well written, believe it or not) I find it distracting.  But the ones I can't hear or understand become more like background music.  Heavy and fast background music, heheh.
<br />
<br />I used to try listening to some talk radio (Art Bell) when coding, but that was distracting as hell.  I noticed that I would turn the radio off during commericals and actually code productively then.  So I pretty much quit listening to radio entirely.
<br />
<br />I normally can't listen to game music while coding.  Not NSFs anyways, it's too interactive, I'm always wanting to change tracks and stuff.  I'm not gonna bother with making my own playlists.

<br />
<br />Those are my two biggest distractions.  I get irritated quickly when I get hot ... which makes it hard for me to concentrate on any form of coding and usually when someone talks to me while I'm trying to code I end up typing parts of the conversation into the code  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_confused.gif" alt=":?" title="Confused" />
