		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I'm developing a way to remotely play my NES using a raspberry pi connected to the internet.  Right now I have only one NES configured, and one controller, but hope to expand to multiple NES and controllers if this pans out.<br /><br />It requires Skype to establish a low-latency video connection.  I had wanted to use a browser plugin for the video but those are all high latency, so Skype it is.<br /><br />If you are interested, here is the site:<br /><a href="http://www.cedararcade.com" class="postlink">http://www.cedararcade.com</a><br /><br />And here are the instructions:<br /><a href="http://www.cedararcade.com/help.html" class="postlink">http://www.cedararcade.com/help.html</a>

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Just to clarify how it works.<br /><br />Even though it uses Skype, the whole process is automated.  That is, you click the &quot;First player&quot; button (after solving the Captcha) and a program I wrote running on a laptop updates the settings in Skype to receive incoming calls.  The program then does a screen capture every 3 seconds and looks for when there is an incoming call, and answers it with video (in this case, the composite video from the NES, which is sent to a DVC100 video capture card to the laptop).<br /><br />So after you click &quot;First player&quot; button, wait about 30 seconds, and then you can initiate a Skype call to &quot;cedararcade@outlook.com&quot; to receive the video.  The game running on the NES is then playable via the browser web page, as your keystrokes are sent to a websockets server which in turn sends them to the raspberry pi, which then sends them to the NES.<br /><br />Here is the block diagram:<br /><br /><img src="http://www.cedararcade.com/img/diagram.png" alt="Image" /><br /><br />Any feedback would be cool  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_cool.gif" alt="8-)" title="Cool" />

Just a guess.<br /><br />Maybe you should consider going to a forum for Raspberry Pi users to see if anyone there will test your remote system.

I think this sounds pretty cool, but I didn't have the chance to try it yet. I still have to install Skype and remember my account information.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />OK, just tried it. Turns out I had a portable installation of Skype that still worked. Anyway, everything worked fairly well, video and audio were pretty decent. The lag was about 1/3 of a second, and it didn't feel like enough to ruin Paperboy (although I'm pretty bad at this game even without any lag). I'm not sure this was the kind of lag you were expecting, but 1/3 of a second is probably too much for the majority of the games. Still pretty cool though, never thought I'd be controlling an NES remotely and receiving captured composite video through Skype!

I actually think 1/3 second lag is actually not too bad, considering you are from Rio de Janeiro, Brazil and the NES is located in Oklahoma City, USA.  I agree, I never imagined being able to play an NES remotely like this, but a week ago I came across a <a href="https://github.com/SonnyJim/snesbot/blob/master/snesbot_schematic_v1.png" class="postlink">schematic</a> that someone put together on how to interface a raspberry pi to make a wireless controller, and I thought, why not go one step further and make it connected to the internet?  So here it is:<br /><br /><img src="http://www.cedararcade.com/img/setup.png" alt="Image" /><br /><br />I'll be making more improvements to it as time goes on, but for now I'm wondering if anyone can beat my highscore of 12,000?   <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />A couple years have passed and I decided to make a few improvements.<br /><br />This latest version no longer needs the player to have Skype.<br /><br />Instead, I rewrote it using WebRTC.<br /><br />So now you can play the nintendo remotely in a web browser.<br /><br />If you are interested in trying it out, here it is:<br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://www.cedararcade.com">https://www.cedararcade.com</a><!-- m --><br /><br />After clicking 'Take Control', click in either the brown or black region to ensure that the page has focus (otherwise it won't capture the keystrokes to play).  Then press 'Enter' a couple times to start the game.  The 'A' and 'S' keys on the keyboard mimic the 'A' and 'B' of the gamepad.<br /><br />As a refresher, this is basically using a Raspberry Pi to control a nintendo over the internet, and I'm using a video capture card to stream the composite video.

Didn't seem like had any trouble playing the game with the lag.  Kinda funny that I made it to the high score entry screen, and that's where the lag really became noticeable.

Didn't get any stuttering or bitrate drops, the video was pretty sharp and smooth during the short time I played. Very cool!<br /><br />I really, really suck at Paperboy though...!

It is hosted in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, USA.  You can ping 104.154.165.231 to get an idea of what the lag would be like.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">tokumaru wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">It worked pretty well here too.
