		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I made a code tonight for Mega Man X to prevent the Dash Upgrade Capsule from appearing. It worked fine in emulators. I converted it to a Game Genie code and put it into my PowerPAK but no matter what it seemed it wouldn't work. Holding select shows the code is correctly decoded. I actually then took my Pro Action Replay and Mega Man X cartridge and tried the code there and it worked. What is going on? Has anyone else has trouble getting Game Genie codes to work? I didn't have any problems using them on the NES PowerPAK. 
<br />
<br />And whenever I pause the game is black screens which suggests the code is doing something unintended like patching somewhere else in ROM.

<br />
<br />Just because you found a tool that can convert codes, does not mean that they will work on the real system. It's very likely that a Game Genie code can be converted into PAR, but not all PAR codes can be successfully converted to Game Genie.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I know what I'm doing actually. Game Genie codes modify ROM. PAR codes can modify RAM or ROM. The codes in question modify ROM and can be converted to Game Genie codes. The codes in question are properly decoded by the PowerPAK. However they do not function properly.
<br />
<br />If you would like to try, the code is this.
<br />
<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">3CAA-CDB3<br />3CAA-CD23<br /></div><br /><br />This should work on both 1.0 and 1.1 versions of the US Mega Man X rom. I used 1.1 to make the code. The code makes it so the capsule for the dash boots upgrade never appears. To test if it works, you should use a password to skip the intro stage and go right to Chill Penguin and see if the dash capsule appears. This password can be used. <br /><br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">Opening Stage beat&nbsp; &nbsp;5385 7136 6321</div>
<br />
<br />As I said, it works on my PAR with my real Mega Man X cartridge. But not on the PowerPAK. I tried my Game Genie but it wouldn't run Mega Man X in its current condition, I'm guessing it is dirty and needs a cleaning so I couldn't test it.
<br />
<br />But it seems like something is wrong with how PowerPAK applies Game Genie codes to ROM.

<br />
<br />If I can I'm going to try to get my actual Game Genie to work to test the code on it. If it works there, its definitely the PowerPAK's fault.

<br />Try using 3CAA-6DB3 &amp; 3CAA-6D23 instead.

<br />
<br />Edit: Those don't work either. Again though pausing the game crashes/black screens like whenever I tried any version of my code. But again it works fine with Pro Action Replay and on emulators. All Via Game Genie code format too.
<br />
<br />Edit: I put the ROM with the GG code pre-hacked onto my powerpak and it all works as intended. So the question is why is it the PowerPAK atleast in this instance doesn't apply GG codes correctly?

<br />Hello there!  I'm having the same issue with Contra III.  I have attempted to update the firmware and it's still not working for me.  Would you mind sharing with us what the SM.MAP you received?  I own both the NES and the SNES version of this unit.  Thank ou very much for your time!  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" />

I'll disassemble and compare this to the original source as soon as I have the time (low priority though since I can't even reproduce the issue).
