Not surprisingly, this is quite likely to happen when you write to $2003 (depending on CPU/PPU clock alignment) or when rendering starts, but it <em>never</em> happens with the auto-increment that happens when you write to $2004 or during normal rendering once it's started up.<br /><br />OAM corruption is actually quite easy to trigger in Visual 2C02 - it happens consistently if you write to $2003 while pclk0 is low (which happens with the default &quot;test program&quot; at halfcycle 274).

Maybe RockNES permits OAM changes at times when OAM should be inaccessible.  If you had to delay the copy until scanline cycle 115, then something else is wrong.

However, I see that attempting to write to OAM during rendering appears to corrupt OAM.  I haven't looked at this in quite a while though.  I don't recall all the OAM insanity.
