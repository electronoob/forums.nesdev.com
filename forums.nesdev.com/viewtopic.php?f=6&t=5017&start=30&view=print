		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I don't know much about the signal levels on RCA cables, but what would happen if you took a Y cable (I've got one I use to split the mono audio to left and right), and used it to mix the audio out and video out together? Would this be safe? Would the levels be such that you could usefully combine PPU and APU audio output?<br /><br />Even if that didn't work, you could use a Y cable to send the video out to both the audio and video, so that you can see and hear this hack at the same time. I wonder if it'd be possible add some more interesting content to the video signal without compromising the sound quality too much. If so, it might make for some unusual demos. (Or even games?)

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Yes, I used a Y cable to split the video signal to make the video I posted. I wouldn't suggest that this will work in all cases (probably depends a lot on the video and audio inputs you connect to), but it was good enough in my particular case to make that recording. If you were doing it properly you'd want an active splitter that can buffer the two outputs, not just a passive Y cable.

All-in-all, it'll sound like a bunch of overtones of 60.1Hz, at varying strengths, and there will a strong correlation with total screen brightness and loudness.

Not something silly like connecting video out into speaker.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />&quot;Music that has something to do with what you see&quot; has a long standing history in game use, but the specific bit about <em>using the PPU</em> implies using the one thing the PPU can do well: be a 4 bit DAC at 5MHz.<br /><br />Playing (optionally transformed) level data as sound is about as relevant to the PPU as it is to a beverage one might drink while playing.
