		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I'm trying to make myself a reproduction of Glory of Heracles - Labors of the Divine Hero. It works great on the Power Pak, but when I burn the image to an eeprom onto an actual UOROM cart i get garbled graphics in different places, mainly on the title screen. I double and triple checked the wiring, and specifically used a UOROM cart instead of UNROM cart so that I didnt have to rewire the mapper for the extra A17 line. But alas...<br /><br />I'm using a AM28F020 chip.<br /><br />Does anyone know what might be going wrong? I can provide pictures of the glitch if needed.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />The chip can't be the problem since the game is running, because UxROM uses CHR-RAM and all graphics are copied to VRAM from the PRG-ROM. My guess is that there's something wrong with the CHR-RAM chip... maybe you accidentally damaged its connections while working on the other chip?

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I wouldnt think so... I never touched anything on that side, and its odd, the graphics that get garbles are not the sprites (i will throw a picture on soon). I was thinking though...is there a possibility that the rom with the translation patch has changed the data around? I know that it doubled the size of the rom from 128K to 256K, so maybe it messed something up? But if that was the case, you'd think that it wouldnt work properly on the Power Pak either.

Maybe the AM28F020 can source too much current for the NES to override it?<br /><br />I'm unfortunately not certain what the best test for you to do next is; if this <strong>is</strong> what's wrong, the fix would be an inverter from R/W to the ROM's /OE pin (assuming /PRGSEL is connected to /CE now)

When they expanded the game to 256KiB, they didn't expand that table to include 7 through 14. (15?)<br /><br />I guess I should report this, although briefly looking I don't see how to get in contact with DvD.<br /><br />I'm also uncertain why Nestopia and Nintendulator don't seem to be emulating the bus conflicts. FCEUX 2.1.5 does, however:<div class="attachtitle">Attachment:</div><div class="attachcontent">

	</div><br /><br /><br />In any case, there are two ways for you to fix this:<br />1- Add any inverter (7400, 7402, 7404, whatever) from CPU R/W to ROM /OE<br />2- Pester DvD to fix the patch.

Just in case you're not familiar with bus conflicts: mapper commands are often &quot;masked&quot; as writes to PRG-ROM, because since the PRG-ROM obviously can't be written to, the writes are routed to the mapper instead. However, the ROM isn't disabled (in some mappers it is, but not this one), so it thinks it's being read, so it still outputs what's stored at the specific address that was written to. If the value being written is different than the one stored in the ROM, there's a bus conflict: two different values trying to use the same address lines at the same time.<br /><br />To avoid this issue, games had to make sure that mapper commands were sent to ROM locations that had the same value as the one being written, so it was common for them to have tables of consecutive values (i.e. $00, $01, $02, $03 and so on, until the largest value that could be written).<br /><br />The original Herakles no Eikou was only 128KB, so it had 8 PRG-ROM banks, and a bankswitch table with values from $00 to $06 (the last bank, $07, doesn't need to be switched in because it's hardwired to $C000-$FFFF). When they expanded the ROM, they didn't update the table, so whenever the higher banks (which they probably have used only for graphics) are accessed, the bus conflicts cause invalid banks to be selected.<br /><br />Maybe this should be brought to their attention. They need to either expand the bankswitch table or relocate it to a location where it can count up to $0E.<br /><br />EDIT: Ninja'd. Yeah, for now your only option is to mod the cart to prevent bus conflicts. You didn't do anything wrong, it's the translation guys that messed up.
