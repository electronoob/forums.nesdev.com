		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I have a few MMC1 questions, perhaps someone can help me.
<br />
<br />1) Mirroring. It's bothering me. Zelda2 never seems to change mirroring in my emulator even if  the gamemode changing from horizontal to vertical scrolling. Other emulators seems to have good behaviour but I'm probably missing something. The controlregister1 always seems to contain the value $0F (=horizontal mirroring) for me. 
<br />Are there any special ways MMC1 games changes the mirroring bits? Perhaps they're reset during special conditions? Anyway, can't find any documentation on any odd behaviour..
<br />
<br />2) Assuming cart has VROM, which banks are mapped in to the PPUMemory during powerup? 
<br />
<br />Thanks alot in advance

<br />No there is no special way. Write to reg0 only will affect it. Maybe it's something wrong with how MMC1 regs are written to ?
<br />
<br />2) You can't tell. It is presumably random.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />There is no rule that dictates what kind of mirroring a game has to use when scrolling in different directions. Every combination is possible, it only depends on how the scrolling engine is programmed. So just because a game scrolls both vertically and horizontally that doesn't mean it has to change the type of mirroring, otherwise games in carts with no mirroring control (most discrete logic mappers) would be limited to one type of scrolling, which is not the case.

<br />I have a feeling SMB2 (U) does the same thing, given how long the blue screen is on screen after Toad lands and goes through the door.

<br />
<br />
<br />When it boots up instead of the game assuming it's in the proper bank it just writes to the chip to select the right bank because there's a chance it's not......(Not 100% sure, but I think thats right?)

<br />Some mappers (or some revisions of them) might have known powerup states but I don't think there's a central place that documents them. If you want to make sure your emulator is not the culprit you could trap in a known good emulator like Nintendulator.
<br />
<br />I checked Bubble Bobble in Nintendulator and it definitely is writing to CHR banking regs ($BFFF, $DFFF specifically) before intro sequence.
<br />
<br />For programming purposes it's the best practice to always assume everything is uninitialized/unknown on powerup.

<br />
<br />I'm implementing MMC1 as of now and I've got a few questions.
<br />
<br />How does CHR-RAM swapping work? I figured out CHR-ROM swapping and it works well, but so far my attempts on addressing CHR-RAM has been unfruitful. 
<br />A few games work fairly well without doing any actual swapping (metroid et al) but some refuse to boot (Final fantasy) and a few got graphical glitches (maniac mansion). Final fantasy not booting might be completely irrelevant and due to a bug someplace else. Anyway.
<br />Is CHR-RAM just an 8kb memory area on board the cartridge (which I assume it is) which the PPU uses like it normally uses CHR-ROM? And if it is, what's the use of swapping? if anybody would be able to clear this up for me I'd much appreciate it!
<br />
<br />and finally, 
<br />How can I tell whether a ROM assigned to mapper 1 is using any of the mapper subtypes, such as SUROM, SXROM and SOROM?

	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />99 % of games with CHR-RAM will swap the 8kb linearly at start up and will never touch this again (and Final Fantasy definitely does that). As far I know there is 2 exeptions : Romancia and Lagrange Point.
<br />
<br />CHR-RAM switching works just like CHR-ROM switching... in the case of the MMC1 you get either 1 8kb bank (that you can't switch) or 2 4kb banks. There is absolutely no use of this on the MMC1 because you can select which pattern table is used via $2000 anyway... but yet it's just because Nintendo decided to tie A12 on the cart to the MMC1 instead to directly the PPU A12 line.

<br />If PRG ROM size is 524288 bytes and CHR ROM size is 0 bytes, the board is most likely SUROM. To know whether SOROM or SXROM is used, you have to recognize the SHA-1 value of a good dump or use <a href="http://wiki.nesdev.com/w/index.php/NES_2.0" class="postlink">NES 2.0</a> for hacks or homebrews.
