<br />You can get similar effects by playing an NES game through <a href="http://pineight.com/nes/#18" class="postlink">my DPCM ripper</a>.

<br />That or the Windows operating system requires icons to be uncompressed in much the same way that CHR ROM on an NES game is uncompressed.

So - someone had to remix it! <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":-)" title="Smile" /> Might as well be Mazedude. Also, I dunno if you've ever messed with shoving EXE, TXT, FNT and whatever else format files into the sample bank of a tracker, but the results are quite fun sometimes. Most of the time it's garbled white noise, but now and then you can find a pitch! Ah, and then you can track with it. There are several moments in the tune where that's what you hear - ONLY non-Wav samples. Files that were never, ever meant to be samples. Garbage! Bwuhaha! Quite a fun twist of irony, eh? Most annoying game music, remixed with garbage! And to top it off, I made it Happy Industrial. Like - the techno folks have Happy Hardcore, but what about the industrial people? Heh, so yeah - all in all this was a fun and silly experiment, I don't expect a ton of folks to dig it, but it just had to be done.</div>

We had a good number of songs that have at least instrument that was created like that.  And of course they come out totally differently if you open it as signed/unsigned, 8-bit/16-bit.  Some of them did sound pretty cool.  The mspaint one turned out pretty interesting.

It would play anything you threw at it as an 8-bit wave file.  I had tried playing other non-wave files with it too, but I noticed that it made more interesting tone-like sounds when I played some text file that consisted of boxes drawn using the MS-DOS character set.

<br />P.S. -- The best part about the PAS16 was how you had to load SB emulation software to get most applications to work with it, since only demos and some other random stuff supported the card natively.  The other best part about the PAS16 was how whenever I'd bring up this fact, advocates of the card would always resort to the same rebuttal point, which was "yeah so? it could do 16-bit 44kHz recording, and it sounded clean without any noise!"  Yep, as you can see, we're all using PAS16s today.  You'll find me making the same arguments ""supporting"" cards I owned myself (GUS, GUS Max) too, so don't think I'm just pickin' on ya, Dwedit.  :-)

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I felt so cheated when I had my first Ensoniq AudioPCI sound card.  For those of you not familiar with this card, it doesn't support any OPL/Adlib sound at all.  Instead, it makes guesses to which wavetable MIDI instruments are close to the desired instrument.  And it usually guesses very very poorly.
<br />
<br />I ended up getting a Sound Blaster AWE64 to replace it, and it was awesome.  This thing could add Chorus and Reverb effects to Adlib sound even in pure DOS mode.  Game music just came alive, sounding almost as good as Wavetable MIDI, but it's still the authentic Adlib sound.
<br />I've never seen DosBox try to replicate anything like that.

<br />I've also tested out some programs that will play MP3 files through the PC speaker.
