<br />Good man! <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />
<br />
<br />Nestopia is good to use but nothing else has the debugging capabilities of FCEUX - it's so essential for developing.

<br />
<br />Alternatively, you could try running it under Wine/Darwine (I am assuming you're using an x86 Mac since PPC Macs have been outmoded for a few years, but I still raise both possibilities). Never ran FCEUX under Wine, so I don't know how it'd run, but assuming there aren't any major incompatibilties, I'd imagine a modern machine would run it equally well under a VM or under Wine.

<br />
<br />That's exactly how I'm using FCEUX at the moment (Parallels VM).
<br />
<br />It works well, just would be better as a native app like Nestopia (things like shortcut keys etc.)

One could also buy an OEM version instead of having to buy the full retail box, as an example Newegg is selling OEM copies of the home editions of XP and 7 for $99.99 - much cheaper than the retail version (I don't see Vista listed there for some reason, however).

<br />See... this is when the best moments of being a "student" come in to action. Though I haven't been a "student" in about 3-4 years I still download Windows from my college campus and use the "student" Pro serial number they give us.

<br />One of my PCs is still on a student copy of XP, but because that PC is still in operation, I can't legally move the Windows license to my Mac mini.
<br />
<br />Oh, and you still have to keep virtualized Windows updated, just like stand-alone Windows.

<br />Hey, that's pretty nice man, not seen it for ages and it's certainly come on a lot!
<br />
<br />I'll have a go with it, sure. From a quick glance the debugging seems pretty usable at the very least <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />
