Is that because of the position of the mirroring bit (there's only 1 unused bit between the bank index and the mirroring bit)? That wouldn't stop you from using all 7 bits, you'd just get a strange layout for them (or you could even bump the mirroring bit to the highest bit).<br /><br />Also, the mention of Rare is pretty random, and even looks like something tepples would do here in the forums, but in the Wiki it's just plain confusing. Why would Rare be the only developers that would make large games?

Sure you could use the 3 upper bits as well, but it wouldn't be iNES mapper #7 any more. Check the good old (and innacurate) Firebug doccument for details.<br /><br />However, mapper 2 (UNROM extention) and 3 (CNROM extention) are extended to 8-bits of bank select, as there is no mirroring select bit. This may be weird, strange and make few sense, but that's just the way it is.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />It makes plenty of sense to me. Oversize extensions are defined so as not to have to extend one field past another field. With UNROM, BNROM, and CNROM, there's only one field in the written value, so the extension doesn't need to cross another field. (This excludes CNROM with protection diodes, which has been assigned to a different mapper.) With AOROM, on the other hand, the mirroring page bit is in the way.

BNROM is a good mention as a variant of AxROM. A theoretical octal latch variant isn't a useful digression. It doesn't exist. The size described is wrong. The mention of Rare is pointless (the point that Rare used AxROM a lot is valid, but that's already part of the lead paragraph). To top it off, I can think of 3 different sensible places to put the nametable bit, so it's not even something emulators should extend like we have with oversized BNROM. Without resolving this ambiguity this statement can't even be considered a proposal for an extended AxROM.<br /><br />In contrast, a similar statement is given on the BNROM page and seems totally fine to me there for all the opposing reasons. (Oversized BNROM homebrew does exist and has emulator support, the size described is correct, Rare is not mentioned, and the extension to the existing mapper is unambiguous.)

It defaults to &quot;mask ROM would have been too expensive back then&quot;, which is fine for mappers whose oversize extension would exceed 1 MB, such as BNROM, CNROM, and UNROM. But for oversize extensions producing sizes that were plausible in the later NES era, I had to come up with a better excuse for why Nintendo didn't implement the suggestion. For example, later <em>Dragon Warrior</em> games use 512 KiB of PRG ROM on the SUROM board, and <em>Mega Man 4</em> and <em>Mega Man 6</em> use 512 KiB of PRG ROM on the TGROM board.<br /><br />Rare AOROM games: <a href="http://bootgod.dyndns.org:7777/search.php?developer_op=%3D%60%40%60&amp;developer=Rare&amp;ines_op=%3D%60%40%60&amp;ines=7&amp;group=groupid&amp;field=2&amp;order=asc&amp;rfa=1+2+11+3+9+20+41+53" class="postlink">21</a><br />Non-Rare AOROM games: <a href="http://bootgod.dyndns.org:7777/search.php?developer_op=!%3D%60%40%60&amp;developer=Rare&amp;ines_op=%3D%60%40%60&amp;ines=7&amp;group=groupid&amp;field=2&amp;order=asc&amp;rfa=1+2+11+3+9+20+41+53" class="postlink">13</a>, including <a href="http://bootgod.dyndns.org:7777/search.php?developer_op=!%3D%60%40%60&amp;developer=Rare&amp;porter_op=%3D%60%40%60&amp;porter=Rare&amp;ines_op=%3D%60%40%60&amp;ines=7&amp;group=groupid&amp;field=2&amp;order=asc&amp;rfa=1+2+11+3+9+20+41+53" class="postlink">5</a> developed by someone else but ported to NES by Rare.<br />So that makes 26 games developed or ported by Rare and 8 other.

In a purely statistical sense, the odds of any given mapper instantiated with 512KiB ROM is fairly low.

It's fun to offer guesses here on the board, but the wiki is reference material. Irrelevant material impedes understanding, after a point.<br /><br />At most it's worth mentioning the theoretical oversize variant using an octal latch. You could even link this forum discussion about it, if you want to give someone a handle to the speculation stuff, but I don't think it belongs on the article page. (It's not much more relevant than any of the infinity of other possible other ideas that could have been implemented in a similar board.)

None of course. So that's why it has never been done. Nobody outside of this forum would ever develop an entire game JUST for using a particular hardware configuration (yes, StarFox was made on the sole purpose to test the Super FX, but here we're not talking about a super new chip or technology, just an additional latch bit).
