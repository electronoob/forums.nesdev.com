		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I've been thinking about the high res packs for n64 textures, and have thought it would be really cool to have high res packs for nes games. The emulator would emulate the game exactly the same, but the graphics engine would replace the chr on the fly with higher res graphics (like 2x or 4x size or something like that--higher color depth also possibly).
<br />
<br />Now there are lots of complications with edited tiles and pallets and stuff like that. I think I have some ideas for some of the complications, but I thought I would just throw this out first.
<br />
<br />The main reason I've thought about this is because I've talked to quite a few people who even get into snes games, but they say they can't get into nes games because of the simple graphics. I can't understand that myself, of course, but I thought it would be interesting to have higher res graphics...

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I'd bet 4-bit graphics upgrade packs would be quite feasible for a NES emulator.  Hell, I could even add that kind of thing to PocketNES.  But that wouldn't increase resolution by anything, just increase the color depth from 2-bit (NES/GBC) to 4-bit (SNES).

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Yeah color-depth would make more sense, to me anyways.  It'd just be matter of replacing each 4 color set with 16 colors.  Minor issue would be color-cycling (I guess the original 4 colors would just be left alone and that'd be fine).
<br />
<br />I imagine if the resolution would increase, if a game has a lot of graphics, no one is going to sit there and redraw each tile in the game.  I wouldn't care much for seeing a bunch of high-res tiles that are just anti-aliased versions of the originals..  Admittedly, this is kind of pessimistic.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />For CHR ROM games, provide a huge (256 by 512*nChrBanks pixel) PNG image showing the double-size CHR. For CHR RAM games, provide a similar image, along with a table from hashes of 8x8 pixel CHR tiles to bitmap tile numbers. Provide a tool based on Scale2x to generate these images from a given ROM (for CHR ROM games) or from a log of CHR RAM, and then let the artist retouch them.
<br />
<br />Palettes can be converted algorithmically from what the emulated CPU writes to VRAM $3F00-$3F1F:
<br />
<br />0: still transparent
<br />1-3: orig color 1-3 but darker
<br />4: orig colors 1 and 2 mixed
<br />5-7: orig color 1-3
<br />8: orig colors 2 and 3 mixed
<br />9-11: orig color 1-3 but lighter
<br />12: orig colors 1 and 3 mixed
<br />13-15: either black-gray-white or semitransparent versions of colors 1-3
<br />
<br />But then you'll have to change the rendering loop to render 2 lines at once: the top half of a scanline and the bottom half.

<br />
<br />In that case, I'd think that a simple external png, loaded by the emulator, alongside the rom would be sufficient.
<br />The only other problem I can see is where the same tiles are used with different palettes. If that were the case, a possible solution could be to keep a table of known palettes that the game uses, and use that to determine which "extended palette" to use. This would work for color cycling as well. Also, the idea is that the extended palette would be RGB, rather than use the nes's palette.
<br />
<br />You would also need to have the original graphics loaded at the same time though, to account for things like sprite 0 hits.
<br />
<br />chr-ram games would be much trickier though, especially ones like Battletoads that do parallax scrolling with the bg tiles.
