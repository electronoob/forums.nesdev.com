I propose that it would act as a launcher to execute *.exe's and trap the kernel usage so that the Windows 95/98 or whatever kernel could be used instead of XP/Vista one. That way, old games like Final Fantasy VII could be played natively on XP/Vista without any fan made patches etc.

<br />Virtual machine is really slow even with my Pentium D 3.2Ghz, and it is w/o graphics acceleration.

<br />How did they mess up the sound?

After all the game was mass-producted, unlike all of its predecessors.
<br />
<br />To what I presonally experienced, the PS emulation is innacurate on FF7. I have to enable a special game-specific fix to get the textboxes border right, and many graphical effect of transparency lacks. All noise in sound effects is removed too and they play really inacurate. I may have old emulator/plugins, tough.

<br />I haven't had any trouble emulating the PS in a while, but I never played FF7. I'm pretty sure that at least one of the current emulators will play the game properly.

<br />
<br />The only time I've emulated the PSX was for FF7 and I used the real disk, I have no idea if it's possible to find existing backups floating arround. Of course you could burn your own CD from an existing one (assuming someone lend the true one to you), but then I'm not sure all securities would be bypassed and all.

I don't think Sony used any kind of copy-protection in the discs, they concentrated on the console. But as long as it's mod'ed, or the games are used with emulators, there should be no problems.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">WedNESday wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">Stuff FF7 and/or PSX emulation and/or buying a cheap PSX on ebay.

I don't know of any generic way to have all your old Windows games running in XP or Vista, except the game-specific patches. I know it can be frustrating not being able to run a game you've actually spent your money on a few years back (I've been there), but with windows this just happens.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">What about my original idea?

<br />I think that if nobody linked to the sort of tool you expect to find yet, it probably doesn't exist. If that is the case, your idea is just that, an idea. It doesn't matter how good or utopic it is, if the tool doesn't exist, no deal.
<br />
<br />Well, just wait a couple more days, someone may actually know of something that will help you the way you want.

<br />
<br />I found a "back up" of FF7 on a totally open to the public ROM site. I was surprised, I thought they wouldn't list this game. They don't list games like SMB or Zelda and things like that.
