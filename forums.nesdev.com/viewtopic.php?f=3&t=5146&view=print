		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Tonight I had a weird but interesting dream I thought I should share.. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />
<br />
<br />In my dream I played a NES emulator on my PC using a wii-remote. But the thing was, the games were adjusted for wii-remote usage. 
<br />Imagine "Punch Out" for example. A hit-like motion with the remote, triggered a normal high-punch (as you do it with the NES controller), and dodging left or right was accomplished with side-step motions.
<br />
<br />When I woke up I thought about this and I think it sounded quite cool. Would it be possible to implement this kind of control in emulators? I know people have managed to connect their wii remotes to their PC so...
<br />
<br />Perhaps a standard set of motions could be defined and with each game you could define that, for example &lt;up+a&gt; on NES controller also is defined by moving the wii remote up?
<br />
<br />Hope you understand what I mean.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />To my knowledge, no emulator for PC supports something like this natively, but there isn't too much need. There are already <a href="http://www.wiili.org/index.php/GlovePIE:Punch-out" class="postlink">scripts</a> for  <a href="http://carl.kenner.googlepages.com/glovepie_download" class="postlink">glovepie</a> that can accomplish such things, and if you don't like the ones available, you can write your own. (Your PC needs bluetooth)
<br />
<br />As well if you have a homebrew enabled Wii, this kind of thing might be supported by its NES emulator sometime soon. The author of the <a href="http://wiibrew.org/wiki/FCE_Ultra_GX" class="postlink">Wii NES emulator</a> (Tantric) has already added such a feature to <a href="http://wiibrew.org/wiki/Visual_Boy_Advance_GX" class="postlink">his GBA emulator.</a> I've tried his Kirby's Tilt And Tumble Wiimote controls, and I've gotta tell you, they rock. (Though they don't seem to return the full range of value the original game did. The main game is playable, but not some of the minigames)
<br />
<br />He also did custom Wii controls for some other game boy/color/advance games like Link's Awakening with Twilight Princess controls, though I admit I haven't tried them. He might add such things to his NES emulator too. That of course, only matters if you have a homebrew Wii. 
<br />
<br />In short: Get Glovepie.
<br />
<br />Also I agree with Dwedit who posted while I was writing this. Punchout is kind of intolerant to lag, and you do get laggy input from a Wiimote on a PC.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Gotta bring up Lua scripting again. You could code a Lua-compatible C-module providing an interface to one of the wiimote libraries available for your os (e.g. wiiuse).
<br />
<br />I've tried this in Snes9x to play F-Zero with the Wii Wheel. That's probably nothing Glovepie couldn't do, but if you need more control over the game  Lua allows to enhance and alter some of its inner workings without having to mess with the emulator's source. Well, to a certain extent at least... The current Lua implementation still has its weaknesses.
<br />
<br />As far as I know Lua scripting is supported by four emulators already: FCEUX, Snes9x, Gens and VBA.

<br />I'm not sure he's a Nazi, he may be just a particularly offensive anti-Israel Arab/Palestinian sympathizer. He's not the first one I've seen.
<br />
<br />EDIT: The real way to fight against him of course would be to make a completely open source superior program to his program with similar features.

<br />Probably better to replace it with some Open Sauce that doesn't have such crazy restrictions.
