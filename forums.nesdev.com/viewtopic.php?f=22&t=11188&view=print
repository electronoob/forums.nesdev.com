In the source code package there is an implementation of the mapper for FCEUX. It was using iNES mapper <s>30</s>31 for the custom mapper, but it looks like that has been assigned since I worked on this project. If anyone has suggestions about assigning this mapper, please make them.<br /><br />Feel free to ask any other questions about the source in this thread. This was a somewhat complex project combining NSFs from many sources into one large ROM, so I hope to eventually create a simpler project that's a little easier to follow.

Each bank is selected by n 8-bit register at $5FF8, $5FF9, $5FFA, $5FFB, $5FFC, $5FFD, $5FFE, and $5FFF, respectively, just like NSF banking. These registers are mirrored across the entire $5000-$5FFF region (the register is selected by the low 3 bits), but it is recommended to use the original addresses. The mirroring is merely a convenience for the hardware implementation.<br /><br />The 8kb CHR region may be RAM or ROM. This project uses CHR-RAM, and the board used by infiniteneslives for this project may only support CHR-RAM.<br /><br />At power-on, the mapper automatically sets all bits in the $5FFF bank register, placing the highest bank in $F000. This occurs on power-on but not on reset, so any bank that is mapped to $F000 after power-on should contain a valid reset vector.<br /><br />At present, the project uses iNES mapper 30 to designate this mapper, but this was merely chosen because it was unused by FCUEX at the time of development. No mapper number has been officially reserved yet.</div>

My idea would be to display a small &quot;album art&quot; picture (let's say 128*128) while it displayed composer, musician, and other information as it played.  Each song would have different artwork.  Additionally, it would have a crude way of visualizing what is playing (such as the square waves looking narrower for 12.5% DC, etc) as well as their hex data.<br /><br />Sounds a bit complicated, but would it be possible to develop a system like that?  My apologies for the slightly off topic post.
