		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Hi,
<br />
<br />First, greetings to you all since I am new to the board...
<br />
<br />I got this idea some hours ago that no doubt many people have had before, yet I could not find any projects on google for it. I don't know much about neither electronics nor programming, but out of interest and a dream of this project to once become true by if not my own hand then by some other peoples hands, I'll spit it out.
<br />
<br />It would be so cool if you could somehow connect a cable to the connectors of a cartridge, so data would go from the cable to the NES and not through some chips on the cartridge board, and then hook that cable to a computer somehow, i guess through a serial or parallell (or usb or whatever) port, and then have a way to talk to the nes through the computer. 
<br />
<br />Next thing would be to code an interface and program that could "load" a game rom that the NES can pull when it is powered on.
<br />
<br />I know it's an insane project both in complexity and timeconsuming....
<br />
<br />I mainly want to know what people who have a grasp of electronics and how the NES works, and programmers also, think of the idea. Just want someone to start thinking about it. Seeing how the discussion goes, perhaps I will even dare to start tinkering around with it, without any hopes to actually get it working but just for fun.
<br />
<br />I am realistic enough to realize I personally likely could never pull it off heh. But it would be cool if someone did and I could build that thing and load roms from my pc someday.
<br />
<br />Here is a silly sketch of the idea: <img src="http://img208.imageshack.us/my.php?image=idea13bb.jpg" alt="Image" />

<br />
<br />Look around this board and see why it isn't as simple as the GBA flash carts... (besides demand)

<br />
<br />I remember someone a long time ago talking about an idea like that, I think as an ISA card.. maybe it was on the old forums.
<br />
<br />The thing is, the latency needed would be extremely low.  There's gonna have to be some hardware in the interface somewhere, because I don't think software could be fast enough to handle it just yet.
<br />
<br />Maybe the closest thing to what you want is an EPROM emulator.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />A lot of people would like a card with 128 KB of PRG RAM, 8 KB of CHR RAM, a few KB of ROM to bootstrap the thing, and an UNROM-style mapper (with bit 3 selecting ROM or RAM in the upper 16 KB). Connect a cable from the PC's parallel or serial port to the NES's controller port, and you have multiboot just like on the GBA.
<br />
<br />Or you could get an FDS RAM card and an FDS Loader cable, which has much the same idea as what I presented.
