		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I meant to post this ages ago but I was just recently reminded about it.
<br />
<br />From what I recall, the current Sunsoft-1 &amp; 2 implementations are incorrect 
<br />and a bit of a mess. First of all, m89 and m93 are exactly the same board 
<br />with a different jumper config to select between CHR ROM or RAM. They could 
<br />easily share the same mapper number and be distinguished by the presence (or 
<br />lack of) CHR ROM. Changing mapper numbers is basically impossible, so 
<br />personally if I were writing an emulator, I'd just have 89 and 93 share the 
<br />same code so they would work either way.
<br />
<br />The fact that Fantasy Zone works as m93 is somewhat of a fluke I think, I remember 
<br />looking at some sources and saw they took some liberties that the cart does 
<br />not have. The 2 chips have a different register format, I don't remember how 
<br />emu's got around that, maybe they special cased it, I can't recall. Fantasy Zone most 
<br />definitely uses the Sunsoft-1 mapper,  except they wired it to bank 
<br />PRG ROM instead of CHR ROM. Again, this can be detected by presence of CHR 
<br />and both setups could use 184 as mapper.
<br />
<br />The only reason this stuff came to my attention was because I could not dump 
<br />Fantasy Zone as mapper 89/93 because its register is at $6000 not $8000 and 
<br />the format is different.
<br />
<br />Here is how they are supposed to work:
<br />
<br />Sunsoft-1 class / ines 184:
<br />No bus-conflicts, hard-wired H/V mirroring, register at 6000h
<br />register format:
<br />   bits 0-2 select 4K VROM at PPU 0000h or if it uses VRAM, select 16K PRG 
<br />at 8000h
<br />   bits 4-6 select 4K VROM at PPU 1000h or does nothing if using VRAM
<br />
<br />Sunsoft-2 class / ines 89 (and 93)
<br />Has bus-conflicts, mapper-controlled 1-screen mirroring or hardwired H/V, 
<br />register at 8000h-FFFFh
<br />register format:
<br />   bits 0-2,7 select 8K VROM at PPU 0000h or do nothing if using VRAM**
<br />   bit 3 selects NT0 or NT1 or does nothing if hard-wired mirroring
<br />   bits 4-6 select 16K PRG at 8000h
<br />
<br />**Note: Don't remember if VRAM is only available as a specific "bank #" or 
<br />if it's available regardless of VROM bits , probably the latter.
<br />
<br />So what do you set the Fantasy Zone mapper too? m93 makes it work in current emulators, 
<br />but technically its wrong. Setting it to 184 makes it not work in current 
<br />emulators because they weren't aware of the issue. Perhaps m93 can be rigged 
<br />as a catch-all, where an emulator can properly implement 89 and 184 and have 
<br />93 a hack that works for whatever.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />OK everyone, we can stop flagging the Fantasy Zone profile now <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /> It has been brought to my attention (thanks Zeromus) that this game actually programmed to work with both the Sunsoft-1 and Sunsoft-2 chips, so it is not wrong to have the game set to m93 (but it should also work as 184).
<br />
<br />I still stand by my conclusions and believe emulators should follow suggestions in my original post. While the game itself will run in either config, the board I happened to find it on (SUNSOFT-4) is not compatible with m93 logic. Possibly later runs of Fantasy Zone used Sunsoft-2 based boards.
