A matter of personal judgment and a little nostalgia of course. But it seems to have been overlooked because half of it has been more or less unheard due to sfx.

This means you can't resume an interrupted note so easily. But on Game Boy, which uses piecewise-linear hardware envelopes, I'll admit it can be worked around by tracking in software the progress of each envelope piece and restarting the remainder of that piece when the sound effect becomes less loud than the instrument. SID, not so much.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Gimmick! uses expansion audio because, according to the developers, the producer was very passionated about making the perfect action game and knew exactly who to have composing the music. But the composer's chords didn't go well with only the 4 channels so they wanted to have a sound chip in the cart to help with this.<br /><br /><br />Back to topic, I'm a real omnivore and like about any genre. I'd like to say FPS as my least liked genre but even that genre have fantastic games like Goldeneye 007. Generally they are seldom aesthetically appealing though, and gameplay is also often boring. I never liked the genre from the start be it Wolfenstein 3D, Doom or Quake.<br /><br />I'm a big fan of Adventure games, simulation and RPGs (even some Western RPGs). I understand that going through a simple menu to fight simple enemies without any required strategy is boring, and RPGs would be pointless if that was all there was to them. Thankfully that's not all there is. Although many older RPGs do contain little variation and lots of grinding which often means little strategy in most battles. The strategy isn't just battles though, it's about counting herbs and torches and taking decisions for survival. Another important part of RPGs is the world it takes place in. Even with simple or no graphics the world is painted in the player's imagination through the text on the screen, much like when reading a book without lots of pictures (I admittedly don't read lots of books though).
