This could be used to advantage for specifying things such as 16K WRAM on mapper 66 (Memblers used this for his garage cart) or the 8K of WRAM for the family basic case.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=230">kevtris</a> — Wed Apr 27, 2011 11:49 am</p><hr />

I agree with tepple's suggestion. During development, PRG RAM can be used for outputting data. I for example enable PRG RAM temporarily just to record level demos. If emulators refused to load my ROM just because it has a mapper that doesn't officially support PRG RAM I wouldn't be able to do this.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=95">tokumaru</a> — Tue Apr 26, 2011 1:53 pm</p><hr />

I agree it's badly defined, but in the end it would all be down to what the mapper does.<br />In MMC1's case, the following "official" combination should be permitted :<br /><br />SOROM : 8k with battery, 8 k without battery :<br />bank 0 is without battery and bank 2 with battery.

That information seems to be very, very strange.

I was just wondering about bytes 10 and 11. The say the following:<br /><br /><br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">Byte 10:<br />7       0<br />---------<br />pppp PPPP<br /><br />p: Quantity of PRG RAM which is battery backed &#40;or serial EEPROM, see below&#41;<br />P: Quantity of PRG RAM which is NOT battery backed<br /></div><br /><br />(and similar to CHR RAM)<br /><br />I understand that a table is used to map the value given in these fields to actual sizes. And bviously it is up to mapping software to determine where the PRG RAM is mapped. But I have some (possibly dumb questions):<br /><br />Firstly, if I understand this right, the *total* amount of PRG RAM is these two fields combined? So a value of byte 10 of 0xAA would mean 131,072 bytes of PRG RAM?<br /><br />Next, if some of the PRG RAM is battery backed, which of it is battery backed? The first portion? The last?<br /><br />So for typical carts which just use the usual 8K CHR RAM, non-battery backed, can I just expect a value 0x07? I know this last one seems obvious, just wanted to make sure I wasn't missing something <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":-)" title="Smile" />.<br /><br />Thanks<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=4806">proxy</a> — Thu Apr 21, 2011 1:53 pm</p><hr />
