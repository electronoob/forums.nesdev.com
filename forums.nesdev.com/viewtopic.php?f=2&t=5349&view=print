		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Before you go on reading please note that this is a very low level technical question. I am recreating the NES in hardware using pure Verilog HDL. I have a question regarding the PPU's status register bits.
<br />
<br />From Brad Taylor's 2C02 Tech Ref:
<br />
<br />Bit 5 - more than 8 objects on a single scanline have been detected in the last frame
<br />
<br />Bit 6 - a primary object pixel has collided with a playfield pixel in the last frame
<br />
<br />My question is, are both of these bits *really* just on a per frame basis (i.e. once the bits are set they remain set for the entire frame)??  I suppose I could believe the sprite 0 hit flag is on a per frame basis but the sprite overflow flag really seems like it should be on a per scanline basis...
<br />
<br />I know someone out there can help!! <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />
<br />
<br />THANKS A LOT!!

<br />
<br />Someone has coded ONE demo that says the grayscale mode if bit 5 is set, and the difference of results between the emulators were disastrous. Some emus considered 8 sprites as overflow, while some required 9 to set the bit (which I belive is correct). Some reset it every scanline, while some only reset it at the begining of the frame (which again I belive correct).

<br />
<br /><em>Bit 5 - more than 8 objects on a single scanline have been detected in the last frame</em>
<br />
<br />would be changed to:
<br />
<br /><em>Bit 5 - more than 8 objects have been detected in the current frame</em>
<br />
<br />- Of course this is triggered in a certain scanline; in other words, AFAIK, there's no "frame scanning" for such overflow. Once it's set in scanline N, it remains set until VBlank ends.
<br />
<br />EDIT: personally, the word "frame" is deprecated. I would use "time" instead.

<br />Not really... You can have 64 in the same frame and never trigger that bit... Just don't put 8 or more sharing the same scanlines! =)
<br />
<br />Sprite rendering is scanline-based, so you can't get rid of the word "scanline". I see nothing wrong with the original description, except that 8 sprites can be enough to set the flag. This flag is too complicated to be explained in a single line of text.

<br />By the way, I'm almost done with the initial rev of my HDL implementation.  I need to iron out a few things with sprites before moving on though.  Right now I have a bare minimum foundation support (i.e. sprite and background rendering with no mappers).  I want to make sure what I have is absolutely *rock solid* first, then I will work on adding a few of the most common mappers, and then start on sound.
<br />
<br />I will be posting pictures on my website of my progress soon.  I am just doing this for hobby at home because I love this stuff!!!  This is not for a college project or anything like that.  I have no intentions of ever stopping work on this - I plan on just making it better and better and implementing as many mappers as possible. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />
<br />
<br />Pz!!

<br />
<br />- I really don't know a game that takes the sprite overflow bit into its engine. Sprite 0 collision is the most used AFAIK. Probably, it's required to create or manage the 8-sprites limitation. I know that a few Konami games use some OAM cycle through the sprites to avoid flickering.
