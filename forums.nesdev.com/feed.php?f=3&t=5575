It's probably because everyone and their dog wants in on the NES emulation bandwagon.<br /></div><br /><br />There needs to be some motivating factor though. I don't believe "it's fun to work on" is something that lasts forever. A little mockup that takes a week of anything you like is probably "fun to work on" but after a while any large project needs something more to keep it going, in my opinion anyhow. Call it fame, attention, whatever, you will find the most successful emulators like MAME/ZSNES get plenty of it. A lot of the MAME guys also like moving from target to target to keep their motivation high, it's harder to do that with consoles.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">koitsu wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"><br />2) Don't worry -- the "behind the scenes" guy will most definitely become known about.

He'll immediately take the "I'm innocent" stance by stating something like this: "lol thts cuz teh emulator enjine is {link to emulator core that he uses}, itz not my bug lol".<br /></div><br /><br />I see what you are saying, but if the emulator core is pretty accurate and runs 99% of games pretty much perfectly most people will never find a game that doesn't run or has issues. What you're talking about only works if there are major bugs and things get fixed by the basement guy, hence bringing attention to them. Even then when those issues are fixed all the new users still have no clue what happened in the past and just continue to assume things.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">koitsu wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"><br />I know generic end-users who actually know of blargg's audio libraries, and instead of questioning them, ask a different question: why aren't these being used in emulators for accurate sound?<br /></div><br /><br />I think anyone with the technical nous to understand these things even on the surface level are the 10% of the users at most. The rest just run the program and expect to see things happen. If they don't they just move on most of the time. So what the majority see is the frontend, the name of the frontend and basically everything that whoever created the frontend wants to show.<br /><br />It's fun being the backend guy if you're getting some sort of compensation for it because then it doesn't matter if most don't know your contributions. If you look at the N64 and PSX emulation world the whole plugin thing just ended up creating a big mess and lack of motivation for the developers of them. Even though it seemed like a good idea at the time, it ended up creating stagnation.<br /><br />That said, something can never fail if you don't try, so who knows, maybe it will work if the right people are behind it. <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=4050">RetroRalph</a> — Fri Sep 18, 2009 9:26 pm</p><hr />

It's fairly easy to just output a "runframe" type API where you pass input, and the core just gives you a 32bit pixel buffer + sound output. Then you just need a few more like loadgame, exitgame, and some kind of way to interface with the emulator. Options and things of this nature make it a little harder but not that much so. My emulator is pretty much done like this, even though there is no use for it at the moment I always like the plugin type mentality. If you do the plugin type interface in a C compatible way, the front end could be pretty much any language, whereas C++ complicates it a bit more.<br /><br />In my opinion I don't think many emulator authors will really like doing this though because the frontend gets all the credit by the average person. The emulator programmer ends up becoming the "hidden in the basement" type specialist guy that no one knows about, so the motivation to keep going would be low I feel. In essence your project becomes a DLL that other "real applications" use. Motivation needs to be high if you want someone to keep spending their free time doing something for free when they could be making money using the same skills.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=4050">RetroRalph</a> — Fri Sep 18, 2009 6:17 pm</p><hr />
