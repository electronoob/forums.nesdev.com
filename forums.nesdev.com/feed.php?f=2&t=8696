As long as redundant tile removing/marking isn't turned on by default I think it's an awesome idea.<br /><br />I know with Genesis programming I end up duplicating tiles due to the way my compiler allocates them for sprites.  I guess what I'm saying is, there's definitely a time when redundancy checking could get in the way.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=4942">slobu</a> — Fri Mar 09, 2012 11:15 am</p><hr />

Say the first 1 KiB of each 4 KiB sprite bank ($000-$3FF) is player sprites. If two such sprite banks are in the same 8 KiB, then you'll have $0000-$03FF and $1000-$13FF identical. And in Super Mario Bros. 2: Mario Madness, which uses 1 KiB bankswitching, you still have identical 1-Up mushrooms and a couple other repeated sprites in the 1 KiB subpages of the 4 KiB page that has the graphics for Mario, Luigi, Yvan, and Peach.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"><br /><div class="quotetitle">tepples wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">Yeah, I'd make 4 KiB the base unit for tile pages.<br /></div><br />Do you mean make two UI elements, one listview for the left page and one for the right?</div><br />That's what I had in mind.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=9">tepples</a> — Fri Mar 09, 2012 6:52 am</p><hr />

I recently added a feature to NESICIDE [not in the released version yet].  This feature takes any set of "images" of any size (8x8 up to 256x256) and removes redundant "tiles" within the whole set, producing a CHR-ROM out the back-end.  I was pretty proud of myself and ready to incorporate the feature into a release.  But then I got to thinking...<br /><br />Duh.  There's a number of cases where one might actually need redundant tiles in a single 8KB bank of CHR-ROM [redundant tiles that are redundant between two or more different CHR-ROM are not removed...].  <br /><br />Example: X-marks-the-unused-tile.  My redundancy removing algorithm blindly removes all but one of the X's.  <br /><br />I'm sure there are other cases where redundant tiles within an 8KB CHR-ROM might be desirable.  <br /><br />1. When the background page and sprite page have one or more identical tiles between them [weird but possible].<br /><br />2. When the CHR-ROM is 1, 2, or 4KB bankswitchable and it's necessary [for some reason] to have an identical tile in one or more of the sub-8KB banks.<br /><br />If you know how I organize CHR-ROM in NESICIDE, it's done by creating a Graphics Bank item.  Each Graphics Bank item has a list-view, which can be used to add, remove, or re-arrange any of the available Tiles (here a tile is an 8x8 up to 256x256 image, not an 8x8 hardware tile) into a CHR-ROM.  Obviously a 256x256 image of unique tiles won't fit so hopefully what you've drawn is reducible or it'd just plain tell you it can't do it!  The tilification is done in real-time as Tiles are added or removed or when Tiles are modified.  But of course, the issue is how to best solve the above problems:<br /><br />1. For the "I want to use this tile as filler, please don't redundantly reduce it" case, I thought perhaps a combo-box selection for each listview line item containing the choices "Fill to next 1KB", ... "Fill to 8KB" would work.<br /><br />2. For the background-vs-sprite page case, I thought perhaps splitting the list-view into two separate list-views would work.  Or an option in the combo-box again, something like "Start 4KB page here".<br /><br />3. For the identical-tile-in-bankswitched-bank case, I thought perhaps another option in the combobox for each listview line item "Don't remove" or similar.<br /><br />So the questions.  Have I considered all the cases or are there more?  Does the combo-box per line item solution make sense or seem cluttery?  The default for the combo-box would be "Reduce if possible" or similar phrasing.<br /><br />I'd appreciate feedback from anyone that may have attempted to use the Graphics Bank in NESICIDE.  If the solution to that equation is the empty set, I'll entertain feedback from anyone.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3705">cpow</a> — Thu Mar 08, 2012 8:44 pm</p><hr />
