		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I like the idea of it in the cart, as USB CopyNES's are $70+ and to me, useless. Needless to say, I don't plan on getting one. I don't see what the advantage is over my EPROM burner and a cart for the mapper any program will be on. I'd be fine with a USB-NES Dev cart. That'd be something really nice to have which isn't done yet. But still, make reproduction boards and I will buy eventually.
<br />
<br />
<br />And if there's a custom made mapper, if emulators don't support it, I'd probably rather have a official Nintendo ROM. Only being able to test on hardware to me is bad. The debuggers and tools we have to make development easier and faster are then pretty much gone. I don't see the point in losing those just for a mapper that may have a few extra features. I don't think we'd need to move on from the MMC1/MMC3 combo. If you need a new mapper for a game, than maybe you should be working on SNES games, or MMC5.
<br />
<br />
<br />If I had my dream mapper, here's my specs:
<br />
<br />1MB ROM support.
<br />1MB CHR-ROM support with 8KB [Maybe 32K] CHR-RAM option.
<br />Mirror selection, possibly with one-screen mirroring.
<br />Scanline IRQ counter, despite never probably going to need one.
<br />And lastly, 64K SRAM.
<br />
<br />Maybe if others posted what would be liked in homebrew mapper, we could all find some good common ground in the specs.

<br />
<br />I agree.
<br />
<br />Also, your desired specs fit a subset of mapper 5's functionality. Mapper 5 has a max 1M PRG-ROM, 1M CHR-ROM (assuming 4K banks are used, 512K max with 2K banks, 256K max with 1K banks), 8K CHR-RAM (NOTE: the actual MMC does not support this but most emulators do) and 64K PRG-RAM. It has a clean and easy way to use scan line IRQ and can support (without ExRAM) any mirroring combination you please except four-screen.
<br />
<br />Best of all bank switching is single-instruction on the MMC5. This makes creating an atomic bank switching library a breeze.
<br />
<br />There are no other features which I would require for a good mapper, and all of this can be implemented as a backward-compatible subset of MMC5. That should work on any emulator that can run CV3 (and probably several that don't <img src="./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" />). Also, mapping that massive chunk of PRG-RAM into the ROM address space should not be a problem either. That's a huge win for folks working on RPGs and the like.
<br />
<br />The last issue is compatibility with the PowerPak, but I'll bet TheFox can whip this up for PowerPak a lot faster than I can finish the HDL code for mine  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_redface.gif" alt=":oops:" title="Embarassed" />

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Yeah, those are my only desirables and would love it. I don't even have any use for a scanline counter (yet) but when it comes to splitting the screen, it seems like it's be a life saver for when I do stuff like that. And the RAM would be great for some games that need to remember a whole map. My good example would be something like <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Mvy5D_wb80&amp;feature=related" class="postlink">this</a>
<br />
<br />
<br />Hardware multiply would be real nice too.  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_redface.gif" alt=":oops:" title="Embarassed" /> And why not just do the PRG-RAM (WRAM) in 8KB chunks? You know it has 8KB of space for WRAM, right? <img src="./images/smilies/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt=":roll:" title="Rolling Eyes" /> Or maybe I'm misunderstanding you, I feel like I might be.
<br />
<br />Yeah, the developers could use those boards, although I still think someone here should make some MMC3 carts soon....soo many donors die every week. Think of all those BFA donors! :'( Haha. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />

<br />
<br />Leaving out CHR-ROM support would save on a lot of things in the mapper. How do you all feel about that?
<br />
<br />Adding the 8x8 multiplier would require adding a data bus interface.

<br />
<br />Probably most of the PCs I've used were brick-able, I bet most cellphones are too, as well as anything that boots from FlashROM.  But it's virtually impossible to accidentally erase flash memory, it's a very deliberate process.  If the software uses the code that is supplied in the bootrom, then it it does become impossible.  The only way I can see the boot bank being erased is if the PRG banking register is written to point to that specific bank before you do the command.  But if you're doing stuff like that as bug, then your program is probably already crashing all over the place before it even gets to that point.  And there is no way the CPU can crash and do random writes to initiate any command except a normal read.
<br />
<br />So I'd say the brick-ability issue, IMHO is a non-issue.  It wouldn't be a problem to repair those.

<br />
<br />No, that is not a problem. The only problem with driving the data bus for reads is that it requires 8 more I/O pins on the CPLD, 24 more registers and another combinational output. This means a lot more room on the CPLD is required, making it more expensive.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I think multiplications are a bit too much. Multiplications are only heavily used in novelty programs, for things like 3D and rotations, things you don't normally do in 2D games. If you really need fast multiplication you can always use a trick that uses a couple of small tables that is pretty fast, there's no need to waste mapper resources on this.
<br />
<br />A decent scanline counter is much more important, because raster effects (split screens, status bars, etc) are much more relevant in 2D games.

The design (MyHDL and Verilog code, micro-controller code, system schematics, PCB files and Gerber files) will be released under open software and open hardware licenses for the betterment of the community and the platform.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I do want to say one thing:
<br />
<br />I like Membler's squeedo.  I like qbradq's enthusiasm for creating <em>something / anything</em> more powerful than MMC1.   I like options, and I think that it is wonderful that talented people contribute their expertise to the community.
<br />
<br />For my next project, I might choose MMC1, Squeedo, qbardq1 or something else.  I will choose a mapper because it is the best fit my the game balanced with production costs.  A mapper decision is never meant to offend the creators of the un-choosen mappers.
<br />
<br />Qbradq, I like the subset of MMC5 idea.  But I might not use it, even though I endorsed it here.  If I don't use your mapper, please don't take offense.  Same for Membler's squeedo design.
<br />
<br />I have a great deal of respect for people who can do things (generally intellectual) that I can't do (and I'm no dummy).  Hardware design fascinates me, but I didn't study it much and choose a software path.  So people who can make hardware are awesome, imho.
<br />
<br />What I'm trying to say isn't coming out right...  I sound weird when I re-read this before posting, but I wanted to put this out into the community anyway.
<br />
<br />ps- qbradq, it should be feasible to modify a few emulators to handle your MMC5-lite mapper, just clone the existing one and disable some stuff.  It would be interesting (but not the main point) to test games (like CV5 and Koei titles) on the new mapper so see if they still work.  Or tweak an emu to log when each mapper feature is used, so that we can analyze what would break or not.
<br />
<br />Now I have no plans to use the MMC5-lite mapper for repros.  But I might base my next game around its feature set with the idea that I want to fabricate carts for a period of time.
