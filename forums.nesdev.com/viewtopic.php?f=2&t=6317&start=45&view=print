I considered writing my own, but the 72-pin NES has no keyboard, so one would have to enter the programs on a PC.</div>
<br />
<br />To clarify, I was meaning there is probably a BASIC interpreter for a hobbyist computer.  Instead of being lazy this time I looked it up and found at least this one: <a href="http://members.multimania.co.uk/leeedavison/6502/ehbasic/index.html" class="postlink">http://members.multimania.co.uk/leeedavison/6502/ehbasic/index.html</a>  It's not free for commercial use, but I'd bet the terms to use it in a game are reasonable enough.  But anyways Xious mentioned porting old stuff, which <em>probably</em> means it's not something one could turn around and sell.
<br />
<br />Yeah it would be nifty to type it up on an NES, but cross-development has many advantages, as you know.

<br />
<br />But it's just a different system, Programing the NES is harder but seems more worth it to me becuase I...it just feels better when hand made, like you didn't use someone elses tool to help you ^_^ But Im sure someone else here who likes this stuff would love your suggestion....

<br />
<br />
<br />Yeah, plus it;s another thing, that you can trust your program 100% ^_^ I hope people know what I am saying so I don't look like I am against it completely, but I just like knowing exactly what it's doing and how to do stuff......Especially with crashing and stuff :/ I don't want it doing funky stuff to peoples programs...
