		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I have a question regarding membler's NES register/memory test program.  You can find it here:
<br />
<br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://nesdev.com/test.zip">http://nesdev.com/test.zip</a><!-- m -->
<br />
<br />I think there may be a bug in it.  When I run this on my emulator, no matter what value I enter into any register the program _always_ writes all 1's to register $4015.  You don't even have to change anything after boot up and you don't even have to have address $4015 listed on the screen.  Just load the ROM and press 'B' (which is apparently how you're supposed to say, "Go write the data I entered").
<br />
<br />It's really weird, it just always writes 11111 to bits [4:0] (the only bits used in $4015 writes) no matter I do.  I suppose it could be something wrong with my emulator but I can't see what would be causing something so incorrect as this.  And I also tested writing to the $40XX registers with my own test ROM and did not see this problem.
<br />
<br />Can someone verify that they see/have the same issue?  I don't know of a software emulator that will show you the state of the memory/registers its using.  Is there one that does this?
<br />
<br />Pz!

<br />
<br />Have you tried using an emulator with a debugger like Nintendulator? You can easily set breakpoints on memory access (like $4015) to see what the program is doing.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Woah, that was a long time ago.  thefox is right, when I wrote it I only cared about the sound registers.  I forgot that I always had it writing to $4015.  I didn't check the source/disassembly (I'm at work), but that sounds right to me.

<br />
<br />Members, is there any chance of getting the source code for this?  Or if you could modify the source to treat $4015 just like any other register/memory address (i.e. only write the value that the user wants to write to it).  It would make the app even more useful - especially for APU debugging, since the user could have total customizable control.  Any chance of this?  Please?  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />

<br />Thanks!

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I have it but it's not the same version, in 2005 I put it back into use for testing my Squeedo sound synth, so there is a CLI instruction you should remove as well as other stuff like writes/reads to $5xxx.  I don't know if I had changed anything else.  This is a really long-lived test program, heheh.

<br />
<br />I'm not surprised the app is so long-lived.  It has a very simple interface but is also incredibly useful at the same time.
<br />
<br />Thanks again!
