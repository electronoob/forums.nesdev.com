		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />With U-verse you most certainly do have such a piece of equipment.  The <a href="http://www.att.com/equipment/accessory-details/?q_sku=sku5480277" class="postlink">NVG510</a> is a dual-purpose device; it's both a router and an ADSL/ADSL2 bridge (&quot;DSL modem&quot;).<br /><br />The router portion of the device is literally intercepting your browsing traffic to tell you that there are problems with your DSL line quality, and makes (bad) assumptions that it's related to the lack of a DSL filter on other lines in your house (e.g. telephones need to be plugged into filters, which then plug into the wall).<br /><br />In my experience, however, the issue usually turns out to be with line quality between the outside of your home (or apartment) and the actual DSLAM at either the CO (central office) or RT (remote terminal).  This manifests itself as bad signal-to-noise ratio (&quot;noise margin&quot; or &quot;SN margin&quot;) or power levels (&quot;line attenuation&quot;).  It's usually the result of some tech out in the field fucking around with wiring (rewiring portions of the area in a bad manner) or damaging existing wiring.  It could also be caused by environmental factors.  Sometimes its related to the time of day (often at night, when things like city lights turn on and cause noise/interference which affect copper wiring).  It can also be caused by distance from the CO or RT, which can sometimes change if engineers screw with area topology wiring (e.g. you were previously 4000 feet from the CO, but now due to a topology change, you're 120000 feet from the CO).  AT&amp;T should be able to rectify all of this, but it may take them weeks or months.<br /><br />You can see all these levels within the device itself; there is an administrative interface on the router which has a page that <a href="http://forums.att.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/11869iE6C33C18CF9022E7/image-size/medium?v=mpbl-1&amp;px=-1" class="postlink">looks something like this</a>.  Don't ask me how to get there, but the device has this information.  The information is lost once you power cycle or reboot the device, so you will need to periodically take snapshots of it yourself.<br /><br />Rebooting the device doesn't actually solve the problem, it just temporarily works around it.  Sometimes slower network speeds get negotiated in this situation (slower speeds allow for less strict signal/power levels), and it'll work until the line quality improves briefly, a new (faster) speed gets negotiated, until things degrade again, rinse lather repeat.<br /><br />If you Google the error message you'll find tons of people reporting this issue.  It's all related to line quality.<br /><br />Bottom line: contact AT&amp;T and make them send techs out to test line quality.  They have the tools which can do this, and can tell you what the problem is.  They can usually figure out <strong>where</strong> the issue is, but you need to put pressure on them to do their job.  They can also (very very easily) rule out inside wiring problems (i.e. issues in your home/apartment).<br /><br />I recommend when engaging AT&amp;T, you begin keeping a very well-written diary of every event.  Dates, times, what transpires, names of individuals, callback numbers, managers names/numbers, etc..  Log everything.  If your issue doesn't get fixed, you can continue to put pressure on the company and all of those individuals until it does get fixed.  Be friendly/courteous, but get every single person's name and number, including that of techs who you meet in person.  Trust me, if it turns out to be a bigger issue, you will need this information.<br /><br />I myself had to do something very similar to this with Comcast, and it took nearly 5 months to get the issue resolved (turned out to be 2 sections of damaged wiring between utility poles which were accepting interference from nearby cellular LTE towers which used the same frequency range as Comcast's service (~700-770MHz)).  You can <a href="http://www.broadbandreports.com/forum/r27688709-What-to-do-about-11-weeks-of-node-network-problems-" class="postlink">read my story</a> if you want (long, but worth a read if you're interested).  I still to this day believe the only thing that lit a fire under their ass was me calling back one of their &quot;supervisors&quot; after many months stating that I was at my wit's end and was considering writing a letter to Comcast's CEO and my local city hall regarding the negligence (specifically because this affected a small area of my city, not just me personally).<br /><br />But most importantly: there is nothing anyone here on this forum can do to rectify your problem.  You need to talk to AT&amp;T.<br /><br />Good luck.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I also have the NVG510, and I switched from AT&amp;T's DSL to u-verse maybe a year ago.  At first it would barely connect, and would be really slow when it did.  But it was fine when I connected it to the box on the outside of the house.  This place still had the old 4-wire phone line, so I replaced it with CAT5 and it's been perfect.  So, if you wanted to rule out the inside wiring that would be one way to test (I used internet connection speed tests and the difference was huge, speed varied a lot with the bad line).<br /><br />I remember also having a 6 month battle with Comcast internet at my parents' house.  I ended up replacing the cable line and splitters under the house which didn't help, eventually the 3rd person they sent out went out and replaced the line between the house and utility pole which fixed it entirely.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Here's a failsafe test that I used to ask people to do when I troubleshooted for an ISP/Telco.<br /><br />1.)  Run power out to your NID (telephone box on the side of your house) and plug up your DSL router to power.  Unplug your IW (internal wiring) from the NID and plug in a phone cord from the DSL router directly to the NID.  <br /><br />(The point of this test is to test fault at the demarcation point; being your internal wiring versus the &quot;drop&quot; (the wiring hooked up to the house by your telecom.)  If your telco discovers that you have IW issues, they will tell you to call an electrician or to buy one of their service packages to rerun wiring to a specific jack in your house dedicated to DSL.  All jacks connected to an analog device or fax machine need to be filtered to remove interference.)<br /><br />2.)  Hook up your DSL router to a laptop (or anything portable that has CAT5 and an OS).  Wait for your DSL sync light to go solid and test for internet connectivity.  Assign a static IP to the computer if necessary.<br /><br />2b.) (Optional) Some routers with admin rights can see noise attenuation ratios for connections.  Very high negative dB numbers are bad.  <br /><br />(This could give you a heads up to potential issues on the carrier's side.  Ex:  Abnormally long loop-length from CO; poor DSLAM card in RT; load coils; etc.  Even if there is a huge, looped bundle of unused copper wire on your telephone pole, that could increase the loop length to the central office to make packet transfers nearly impossible.  Sometimes the NID itself is really dirty.  There will be two sides of the NID, your side and their side.  Clean your side.  There may be birdshit, squirrelshit, and all sorts of shit in there corroding and making for a poor connection.)<br /><br />Many ISPs charge for a truckroll if they find an issue on your side.  Don't send them out unless you can pinpoint them to be an issue.  They might even come out and clip your copper to be shady fuckers to push fiber on you.  I know that's a part of Verizon's practice from experience.  Field techs (the people who go out on truckrolls) are protected by unions and can get away with most things for and against their companies.

It was caused by a failed route within my ISP's network.<br /><br />In your case, it sounds more like a DNS issue. You can use <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nslookup" class="postlink">nslookup</a> to check:<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">nslookup vgmdb.net</div><br />According to whichever DNS server I'm using, vgmdb.net resolves to 199.102.228.233.
