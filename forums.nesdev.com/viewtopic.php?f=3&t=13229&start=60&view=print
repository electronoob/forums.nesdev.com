But I must have my column in a continuous array in ram. <br />Maybe it can work with an indirect HDMA mode and tables?<br />However making a copy of 30 words to a transfer buffer can be quick, I made one of 128Bytes from the sprite buffer and it took 5 rendering lines. Maybe doing it by software is not that bad. I must try it.

I tried to use the source code of Memblers emulator but it seemed not up to date on the 65816 side (I could not load the SPC700 code, and used the routine form the NSF player ROM instead). And I do not have the assembler for the SPC700 code.<br />Therefore I used directly the binary data extracted from the NSF player big ROM using the memory dump of the SPC700 RAM and an hex editor to cut it out.<br />However I must find out what it does to emulate $4015 and other register updates.<br />The update_dsp routine works, but I need to understand what it does to the APU registers during the interrupt on the 65816 side. The APU emulation routines from the NSF player ROM and from the source in 2a03-src.zip are different.

Command to assemble is &quot;tasm -t700 -b -a spc.asm&quot;<br /><br />Sorry the source release was a mess, the original project is too (1,944 files all in a single directory).<br /><br />It tracks register updates in the &quot;detect_changes&quot; subroutine.  The RAM at $7F4116 has some flags to tell the SPC when $4003,$4007, etc. were written.  The trick is, the value the NES code writes to $4003,$4007,etc. has to be non-zero for it to be detected!  This works out because the length counter bits must be non-zero for there to be sound anyways.<br /><br />The length counters are emulated on the 65816 side, and this adds some extra handling to the $4015 register.  The program uploads $4015 to the SPC, masked with the length counter result bits, like this:<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; lda $7F4115&nbsp; ; length counter enable flags, sent to SPC<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and $7F4015 ; what the NES program wrote to $4015<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; sta $7F4115<br /></div><br /><br />If I can get upernes to build over here, I'd like to take a shot at improving the sound quality.  The main thing I'd like to try is using longer samples for the waveforms, because the short samples are extremely affected by the SPC's interpolation.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Thank you Memblers, I used the disassembly windows of bsnes+ and two of the procedures are exactly the same as the source zip. Only the code loading the binary on the SPC700 is clearly different. And the fast rom init sets slow rom in the source code.<br />I will check if what I have from the two other routines and the source code are the same.<br /><br />Tasm may help, thanks.<br /><br />I could not understand what 4116 was for. I though it was the gamepad data  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" />. I was confused by this value.<br />Your 4 routines are already in Sound.asm, only two of them work and my backup register offsets are a mess in var.inc because I have an hardcoded ram @ after them (not enough reserved space). But by removing the unused backup registers, it should begin to work.<br />I will work on this tomorrow.<br /><br />I you have a windows 64bits, you do not need to compile upernes. If the exe runs, it should be fine, the development is mostly in the asm files. (If the SDL graphic window showing the progress makes problems it can be removed)<br /><br />About my progress:<br />Today I tried to update columns instead of using the DMA and even with loop unrolling it takes about 15 rendering lines instead of 4, and it glitches.<br />A way to improve the nametable transfer would help a lot, maybe by converting vertical scrollers like Xevious first. Lines updates are easy using the DMA. Column updates are tricky.<br />Maybe it could work by preparing the data from column to line after the sound emulation code. If enough cycles are available there. Or by preparing an HDMA table for colums.<br /><br />My smb1.txt file to disassemble the indirect jump areas:<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">##########################################<br /># smb1.nes<br /><br />crc32:&nbsp; &nbsp;$F2DB8422<br /><br />DisableIndJumpPatching<br /><br />SoundEmuLine: $97<br /><br />IndirectJump: $06<br />addr: $8231<br />addr: $8FCF<br />addr: $8567<br />addr: $858B<br />addr: $859B<br />addr: $8652<br />addr: $865A<br />addr: $8693<br />addr: $86A8<br />addr: $86E6<br />addr: $93FC<br />addr: $88AE<br />addr: $92DB<br />addr: $9B0E<br />addr: $9A2E<br />addr: $85BF<br />addr: $85E3<br />addr: $8643<br />addr: $86FF<br />addr: $8732<br />addr: $8749<br />addr: $9061<br />addr: $8245<br />addr: $9131<br />addr: $B069<br />addr: $B0E9<br />addr: $B35A<br />addr: $AEDC<br />addr: $8FE4<br />addr: $889D<br />addr: $9071<br />addr: $AEEA<br />addr: $B376<br />addr: $C2F1<br />addr: $C8E0<br />addr: $CA77<br />addr: $98E5<br />addr: $B36D<br />addr: $BDD2<br />addr: $BC85<br />addr: $B233<br />addr: $9B01<br />addr: $BB38<br />addr: $B269<br />addr: $9B41<br />addr: $91CD<br />addr: $B245<br />addr: $9B14<br />addr: $B27D<br />addr: $B1E5<br />addr: $96C5<br />addr: $9B19<br />addr: $9A50<br />addr: $99F2<br />addr: $B94B<br />addr: $98AB<br />addr: $970D<br />addr: $B206<br />addr: $9AB7<br />addr: $999E<br />addr: $9218<br />addr: $C8D6<br />addr: $9806<br />addr: $D2D9<br />addr: $C30E<br />addr: $BDD8<br />addr: $9968<br />addr: $9A59<br />addr: $D311<br />addr: $B2A4<br />addr: $B3CF<br />addr: $B2CA<br />addr: $D2F2<br />addr: $D312<br />addr: $D34E<br />addr: $D3A2<br />addr: $9882<br />addr: $9224<br /></div>

I will take the data from the ram buffer.<br />Every update @ and data must be written in the table.<br /><br />Actually it works well but the attribute table refresh lags because it must use the rolling DMA update.

The nes code forces vblank before updating the screen. I was not emulating it because it was easier to debug BG data, but is was time to add it.<br />Now it works. The VRAM update is made during the register write emulation and not during vblank.

The sprite bank select in $2000 is ignored, and instead the LSB of each sprite's character index is used as the bank number for that sprite.
