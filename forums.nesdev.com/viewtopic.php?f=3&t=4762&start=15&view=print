<br />
<br />Maybe you could give the user the option of using either iNES "1.0" or 2.0?
<br />
<br />I don't know if this fits with NEShead's mission as a header editor opposed to a complete "ROM tool", but I believe some people may appreciate the ability to insert/remove/extract trainers, PRG/CHR ROMs and misc data appended after the CHR ROM for expansion. (Yes trainers; while they are frowned upon here, they are part of the iNES specification.)
<br />
<br />I think header correcting through a database is also a great idea. It would be nice however if users could generate their own database from a directory, then quickly switch between files in the database using a select field, allowing people to correct many files quickly. From there it would make sense for them to be able to save (using a click button or hot key for speed), then update the database. Lastly the ability to fix files (with a warning/"Yes to all") using a database would allow your tool to fully replace GoodNES as well as other attempts to do so by clueless ROM groups.

Maybe if iNES 2.0 was widespread through the use of NEShead, emulator authors would decide to remove the hacks on ambiguous mappers and embrace 2.0.
<br />
<br />Some other suggestions I have are:
<br />
<br />-file drag and drop support.
<br />-the ability to refresh the "Hexdump" field without actually opening a file so one can simply generate a header.
<br />-a choice between two different Hexdump options: "source code" or "hex editor" (?) mode where the output is strictly uppercase hex ie "4E45431A0000000000000000" so it may be pasted into a hex editor such as Hex Workshop.
<br />-a choice between a few common source code byte directives? I know some assemblers only like ".db", others may allow ".db $4E, $45, $53" as well.
<br />-maybe an option to auto-refresh the Hexdump?
<br />-maybe an option to refresh the Hexdump and copy the text to the clipboard at the same time?
<br />-maybe an Edit menu with Copy for people who don't know to CTRL+C?

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I've updated the program to a new version today:
<br />Source/hex views are now updated in realtime and....
<br />
<br />... I've also added some simple database functionality. You can create a simple database and add ROMs to it (well some basic information about them anyway).
<br />This works like a look-up database. NESHead checks the database when you open up a ROM and if there's a match, the header is compared to the one in the database. If there's a mismatch you could replace your faulty header with the one found in the database.
<br />
<br />New ROMs can easily be added to the database by picking one at a time (main-view) or simply adding an entire directory at the same time in the ROM-manager section.
<br />
<br />Check it out if you're interested.
<br />
<br />Remember, all this is highly experimental (and in beta-state) so beware.. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />When I have to change my header specs I find myself in this process - compile ROM with old header, edit header in emulator, hex edit header out of ROM, and save to header.bin.  It's about as much work as editing header.bin in a hex editor to begin with.
<br />
<br />If you could just make it possible to save header to a new file (and overwrite), rather than insert to an existing one, this would be about as good as it could get for me.
<br />
<br />I always keep my header apart from my game source, assembler, and everything, since it's completely irrelevant to the NES and cartridge.

Well you could anyways, not at the moment because it is locked right now while I'm working on this transition. I'm also going to start posting pre-compiled snapshots of the DB for download, because doing it thru the client software can be painfully slow if your not local.
<br />
<br />Also I will be writing a utility to convert between all formats (iNES,UNIF, and the XML/zip one). I suppose iNES 2.0 as well, if there is demand for it. Source will be included for it. I know this utility is long overdue, but I will get to it as soon as I get the new system online.

<br />You should definitely support iNES 2.0, maybe it's that programm that will extend the usage of it who knowns ?

With all your goodie tooshoes sites about removing the trainers from your roms.  Every iNes file is now practically sanitized.  We may have had a dirty time in those days, but it was good enough for us all.  US ALL.
