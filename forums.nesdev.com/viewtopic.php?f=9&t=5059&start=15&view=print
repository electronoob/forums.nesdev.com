<br />
<br />There is some adapter to convert 72 pins to 60 ones. Some people on this board are using them for the powerpak.  Maybe I will try to find one someday if I get a powerpak.
<br />
<br />Edit:
<br />
<br />The link that I found but never bought from them yet for the adapter is <a href="http://www.superufo.com/product_html/Cool_Stuff_FC_NES_72_Pin_to_60_Pin_Convert.html" class="postlink">here</a>.

<br />Possibly because they have to include some sort of lockout defeat in order to work on frontloaders as the end user expects, and the CIClone is fairly recent.

<br />
<br />I like famicarts because I can find edge connectors easily for them. Making it easier to make a bridge between the two so I can have test points. Plus I think famicom cartridges are small and cute.
<br />
<br />(edit: no they have a 60 to 60 pin connector in them. so this entire paragraph is wrong)
<br />Now that I know (edit: no I didn't) that gyromite/pinball/etc can have a female-to-female 60 to 72 pin adapter inside (I've collected 2 already, I have more I think in my collection). I can pretty much build anything to anything (even 72 to 72 extension with test points) but just making the right PCB to fit between. I could even put drivers on the address and data lines and stick LEDs on them, that would be amusing, but probably only useful if I put a way to stop the cpu.
<br />
<br />An address decoder on the PRG bus with a bunch of switches to select an address to trigger clocks to stop would be sexy. But I think it would require cutting a lot of traces on my NES.
