I have every .dat file renamed, and songs.asm edited as necessary.  Still no go.
<br />
<br />If anyone would like to look at this for me and let me know why it won't work, I'd be VERY grateful.  I'm pretty sure all the appropriate files are included.

<br />
<br />Just find this part in nt2-22.asm, and change the byte for the number of songs.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Awesome!  It works now.  There is one problem however... the samples don't work properly.  They make a very nasty sound in the background.  When the .nsf is just a single song, they sound fine.  Is there any way to fix it so the samples play right in a multiple track .nsf?
<br />
<br />EDIT: Thanks a ton Memblers!
<br />
<br />
<br />UPDATE:
<br />Okay, I noticed that it's building with one sample from the "temp.dmc" in this snippet of code from NT2-22.asm:
<br />
<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">.segment &quot;SAMPLES&quot;<br />.incbin &quot;temp.dmc&quot;<br /></div>
<br />
<br />Instead of two samples it's just creating one... do I perhaps need to add in a second .incbin dmc, then edit the makensf.bat file to include it also?  If so, how do I go about doing that?  I'm not sure if that would work, since I can't edit the other temp files (temp.ihd, temp.dtt) to help it along if need be.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Just wanted to post to let everyone know what the problem was, just in case this happens to someone else.  The temp.ihd file was the incorrect file.  After deleting it and letting a new one appear, all compiled correctly with the samples and such.  Thanks to Memblers once again for helping me with this problem.

<br />
<br />If anyone checks it out, it's what I wrote in order... thus the name Progress.nsf.  The first couple of tracks are before I learned to use samples/sample editor.  There's a couple of cool things, like towards the end of track 6 the bass makes an emergency alarm type sound, and track 7 has a record scratch sample.  I think it turned out decent overall.  Also, thanks to Tepples who helped me early on while learning how to use NT2.
<br />
<br />Does anyone know if you can set something in NT2 that tells a song to stop at a certain point?  So if I have a complete song  it doesn't keep looping, that is.
<br />
<br />EDIT: Sorry about the triple post, but it's been awhile since posting on this thread anywho.

<br />
<br />Use the Fxx effect with F00 in any channel, it'll stop right there.  However, don't let it play to that point in NT2 because it'll never go again until you re-start NT2 (and might carry over to the temp.dat file if you create it when it's stopped, though I'm not sure).

<br />Are there any known ways to create NSF's with multiple tracks from separate NSF files exported from more than one program?
<br />
<br />Thanks,

<br />
<br />Sure.  You'll need space for the NSF init routine, and a way to redirect the play routine to the real play routine for each sound engine.
<br />
<br />Then what you'd do is in the NSF init routine, write to the NSF bankswitching registers to swap in the NSF you want for a particular song #.  If each NSF is 32kB, you'll need put the init and play routines in the same place in memory (the play routine could simply be a JMP to it from $8000 for example).  If the NSFs are smaller than 28kB you could use the last bank (or whichever is free) to hold the init code, and never have to switch that bank.
<br />
<br />Make sense?
