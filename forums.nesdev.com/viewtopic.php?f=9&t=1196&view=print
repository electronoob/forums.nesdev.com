		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I posted about this over at nesworld the other day, figured I would here as well.
<br />
<br />I've been putting off publicly releasing anything because I'm constantly tweaking either the software or the website. But I decided I could just as well open it up for a few, since it seems like I'm never done anyways.
<br /> 
<br />In order to submit data to the site, you currently have to use the software and also have a CopyNES. The software is available on the "submit" page.
<br />I have yet to write a proper readme / guide. It is for the most part self-explantory, but I'm sure there are many things that may need some elaboration. If anyone is having any problems, don't hesitate to ask.
<br /> 
<br />For those of whom would like to just see what's there so far <a href="http://bootgod.dyndns.org:7777" class="postlink">here</a> is the temp link. Please do not spread this link around for the time being.
<br /> 
<br />Some of you may notice the site layout looks very much like vgrebirth.org because that's what I based it off it. I don't intend to keep it this way, I just needed something to start with, as I'm a programmer, not a web designer.  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_confused.gif" alt=":?" title="Confused" />
<br />
<br />The software for it is for the most part done, it has been for quite a while I've just been adding small things here and there.
<br />
<br />The site still needs plenty of work. Some things do not work and others may not work as expected, and it certainly doesn't have all the features I have planned for it.
<br /> 
<br />The data it is collecting is the main thing I'd like to hear about. Especially if there is anything else you think it should be storing.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />That is AWESOME!  Heres some suggestions to make it even more awesome:
<br />
<br />1.  Add search with things like board type and prg/chr memory size.
<br />
<br />2.  Have some way to compare ines headers.  There should be correct info there to produce accurate headers, sort of a new goodnes list that is verified and updated.
<br />
<br />3.  Have a list of known carts that arent in the database.  I can definitely contribute and having a list of needed dumps would make it faster.
<br />
<br />Im guessing theres no good legal way to distribute the correct roms so I will still have to dump all my carts sometime...

<br />
<br />More search functions are at the top of the list, specifically hardware based searches.
<br />
<br />You can load ROMs into the software, if it recognizes the ROM data, you can re-save it in either INES or UNIF. Basically it functions like goodnes in that sense except it can correct bad headers and what not.
<br />
<br />As for known carts that aren't in DB yet, I have no plans for such a thing, but it's a possibility.
<br />
<br />You may have noticed there are often many entries for a given game. When you dump a cart, even if you think it's in there, there may be subtle diffs from other entries, so a new one would be added. I found that it's just as quick to dump multiple copies of the same game as it is to check if it's been dumped and there are no differences.

<br />
<br />As it is, I have 2 unrecognized games (Athletic World [BC5F6C94/51BF1FC5] and Super Team Games [F210E68F/A11F69FF], both on NES-CNROM-256-05 boards) and 2 games on different boards (Ironsword on NES-AOROM-02, Bad Dudes on NES-TL1ROM-01), and I cannot add the correct dumps.

<br />Thanks, that did the trick (though I'm not sure if it properly set my ECP port to bidirectional or if it was just still in that mode from last running CopyNESW). I was able to successfully submit the 4 new entries I mentioned earlier. Athletic World was a bit of a trick, though, since I had already converted it into a RAM cartridge - using CopyNESW, I was able to reupload the game to the cartridge (and write-protect it) so your program was able to redump it.

<br />
<br />I should point out for others too, that this program is <strong>NOT</strong> a replacement for CopyNesW. This software will only dump carts/saves, it does not support writing back nor all the other misc functions that CopyNesW offers.
<br />
<br />I'm working on a guide right now that covers how to use it and what everything means, hopefully I'll have it done within a day or two.
<br />
<br />Update 3/13:
<br />I'm working on some fairly significant changes to the dumping process, so the guide is on hold until I'm finished.

<br />
<br />That being said, and not trying to come off as a complete prick, but we the admin &amp; staff of Video Game Rebirth earnestly hope that the design for your final site is radically changed from its current state for as it stands it is a total and complete swipe of our site design and layout which is not cool from either a technical or legal standpoint.  While we understand from the above post that the site design is supposedly "temporary" we will be waiting and watching to see the extent of the redesign.

I have been taking a break from the site/software for a couple weeks, but I will work on the design next if it bothers you. And by all means if you want me to take it down in the mean time I have no problem with that.
<br />
<br />Blargg, the software will support a function to compile an "offline" database, filled with only whatever fields you want in there, so you could easily whip up a small program to do whatever you like with the data. Btw, I love the outstanding work you've done NTSC filter.
