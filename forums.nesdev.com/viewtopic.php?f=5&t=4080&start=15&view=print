<br />Sounds more like cognitive dissonance. Why all the hostility towards Apple? Those who have actually used them for more than a few minutes know that the difference is more than skin-deep.

But yeah, the differences are more than skin-deep. I, myself don't really like using them, since Windows is so standard and I'm used to it.

<br />I do not dislike the company . My only complaint to them would be that  most of there products are overpirced.
<br />
<br />I am not a fan of that type of advertisement. I consider it dishonest, Thats all.  The machines themselfs are desent enough.

While you will be able to recompile apps like cc65 and nesasm with no problems, there is still no NES emulator with a debugger.  No reason there couldn't be just that nobody has done it yet.  You may want to keep your old machine around for a parallel port too.
<br />
<br />I absolutely agree the towers are overpriced, but so far I have not seen anything that comes close to the size and quality of the MacBook Pro laptops.  The Mini is also an amazing machine if you don't need any graphics power at all.  With everything running on Intel now you can choose XP for the apps that have no equivalent and use MacOS for everything else.  I work alone from home so looking cool isn't really a consideration for computer choices  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />[/code]

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Thanks for the thoughts, all. 
<br />And to chime in on the "debate," I am looking to get the Mini as a general-purpose home computer and DVD player. The tiny, tiny apartment does not lend itself well to a full-blown computer setup. (Hence, the server tower is in a storage closet...) So, I'm hoping to put the Mini in or on top of my TV stand along with the gaming consoles and use my TV as the monitor. My original plan was to build something cool looking with a Mini-ITX, but I think that the (Mac) Mini will ultimately be cheaper. I've also been really impressed with Mac's customer service. They were REALLY nice about replacing my iPod when it wasn't working right, and I've had a crappy experience with my getting my Compaq laptop serviced. ("No, we won't fix the mouse button. It's not broken. Just press it really, really hard.")
<br />I was pondering a Mac laptop if the Mini thing goes well. But even then, I'm concerned about compatibility, so I may try to go another route for the laptop.
<br />Okay, I don't know why I'm going on... I'll shut up now. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />
