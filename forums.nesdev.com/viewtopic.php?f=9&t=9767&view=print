		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />This's a 15$ ebay gremlins 2 famicom pcb converted into a fully functional gimmick! cart with the extra audio due to me being lucky enough to get a cart with a sunsoft 5b chip in it.<br /><br />The sound circuit which I found on a japanese website:<br /><br /><img src="http://imgboot.com/images/Drakon/sunsoft5bmix2.png" alt="Image" /><br /><br />The eproms are now directly soldered into the pcb and the precision sockets have been removed since everything is working.  I built the audio circuit using the wrong parts (1.1k ohm instead of 1k ohm, 10 ufs instead of 1 ufs) which is why the audio circuit is just floating and not built into some nice protoboard while I wait for the right parts to show up in the mail.  Probably the most annoying part of this mod was I had to desolder the suinsoft 5b chip using a heatgun to cut a trace underneath which was grounding one of the necessary audio pins.  Wiring the prg eprom is annoying too because it's a 32 pin eprom in a 28 pin spot.  One of the pins on the prg eprom (a17) needs to be connected to one of the sunsoft 5b pins which was left floating since the previous maskrom didn't use it).  Here's the pcb in the current state:<br /><br /><img src="http://imgboot.com/images/Drakon/gimmickreprohalfdoneback.jpg" alt="Image" /><br /><br /><img src="http://imgboot.com/images/Drakon/gimmickreprohalfdonefront.jpg" alt="Image" /><br /><br />And of course, a video of it in action (before I hard soldered in the eproms)<br /><br /><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVJTyAoSzTM" class="postlink">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVJTyAoSzTM</a><br /><br />A full wiring schematic will come later if I find enough time.

But functional certainly counts for alot. Post another picture when you're done. Also, I saw your video and thumbs up for using a real TV to play NES/Famicom and not a crappy Digital TV.

I prefer to use the HDD style wires for most of my projects.  I used to use solid core wire, but my major issue with it is there is little to no stress relief on the solder joint.  If the wire gets pushed or pulled much it'll break free.  Although when the whole thing is coated with glue, it's of less concern. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />  BTW, is all the glue for stress relief?
