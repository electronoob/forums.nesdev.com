But to understand why it happens at all you'll need to learn that it's because you didn't type an output, so it sends the data to stdout (monitor). Then, you learn piping and feel confident using <tt style="margin-left: 2px; margin-right: 2px; padding:3px; background-color: #3355aa; color: white;">cat file | more</tt> - that's when your partner tells you to use <tt style="margin-left: 2px; margin-right: 2px; padding:3px; background-color: #3355aa; color: white;">cat file | less</tt>, because &quot;less is more&quot;. <br /><br />All the time not questioning why it is called <tt style="margin-left: 2px; margin-right: 2px; padding:3px; background-color: #3355aa; color: white;">cat</tt>. Then you learn it's conCATenate, but since you didn't type anything to concatenate with, it just sends the data directly to the output. <br /><br />If that's the way it's going to be, no wonder public administration, schools and other institutions tends to cling to microsoft/apple despite it costing them sweet millions  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_lol.gif" alt=":lol:" title="Laughing" />

Even the name.<br /><br />Try updating python to the latest version on a Raspberry Pi (python arguably being the reason for its existence).<br />Experience the dependency hell that is Linux, and the weasel reasons for it.<br /><br />Sure thing, all these little programs that do one thing well (oh but by the way that recursively rely on a bunch of other little programs) is a great idea (/sarcasm).<br /><br />Sure thing, source code is included, but muwahahaha, you noobs just try and compile it with this sinister makefile. What, why haven't you modified your configuration files by hand the same way I have them? What? The license for the library of this otherwise &quot;free software&quot; restricts me from using it in commercial software that'll sell to like 30 people because of the author's personal political beliefs, and the author is either non-reachable or being a cheeky asshat by demanding &quot;one billion dollars&quot;? And the remedy is &quot;write it yourself&quot;. Yeah, but no thanks.<br /><br />And there are other independent operating systems out there, but still rife with stupid humor. Oh &quot;Plan 9&quot;, that sounds like a winner. Already seeking infamous failure by just the name. Why not the Hindenburg OS, Titanic Edition, version I-85 (soon to be I-94).

Nothing in a free software license prohibits <a href="https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/selling.en.html" class="postlink">distributing copies for a fee</a>. Back in the dial-up era, it used to be common to get a GNU/Linux CD based on Red Hat (before it was called Fedora) bundled with books like <em>Linux for Dummies</em>. All a copyleft license does is keep you from adding restrictions on those 30 people. And FreeBSD doesn't even have that; significant parts of it are used in the heavily locked down operating systems iOS (iPod touch, iPhone, iPad) and Orbis (PlayStation 4).
