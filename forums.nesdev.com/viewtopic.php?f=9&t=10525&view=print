I've googled and searched the forum, but somehow not found anything.<br /><br />I feel this belongs in the hardware section because it relates to <em>obtaining</em> hardware. Please tell me where the correct section is if I'm wrong.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />For those of us in the US, eBay is usually the most convenient.  However, you should expect to pay generally absurd amounts of money for it -- there's really no avoiding this on eBay unless you find a really good/ethical seller.<br /><br />For a classic/original Famicom, the prices shouldn't be too bad.  You might get gouged a bit on shipping (particularly if it's being shipped from Japan), but there isn't too much you can do about that.<br /><br />For a Famicom AV, the prices will be much higher -- usually a few hundred.  I got lucky and found a seller in the US who was selling his Famicom AV + one game for a reasonable price and bought it immediately.  I told him who I was/etc. and he said he was thrilled to know it was being bought by someone who'd use it and not simply resell it on eBay for an even higher price.<br /><br />The only other option is to use one of the many Japanese auction sites and rely on a... hrm, what are they called... well there's a term for them but I can't remember.  Basically there's an &quot;agent&quot; or &quot;company&quot; that will buy things from Japanese auction sites on your behalf (for a fee) and then send them to you.  Most Japanese people won't ship out-of-country, hence why these &quot;agents&quot; exist.  Again, there's a term for them, I just can't remember what it is right now.  You might get a better price using that method, but sometimes the fees can be expensive; it varies heavily.<br /><br />I tend to avoid sellers on eBay who are selling consoles out of Hong Kong or other countries -- I stick with Japan only.  The reason is that there's a very good chance what you'll get sold is actually a clone unit.  Some of the sellers disclose if it's a real/original or not (and will usually provide photos of the labels/etc. proving such), but others just say &quot;Famicom blah blah&quot; and what you get is a Hong Kong or Singaporean clone.  The likelihood of this happening from a seller who's in Japan is much lower.<br /><br />IMO, best choice (if you ask me) is just to use eBay and be patient/keep an eye on things.  I tend to use Buy-It-Now a lot because I don't like bidding wars and people who outbid with 1-2 seconds to go.

It seems that customs here in Brazil are more inclined to tax packages coming from the US, while not so much from other countries.

You might get a better price using that method, but sometimes the fees can be expensive; it varies heavily.</div><br />I've not heard of &quot;the many Japanese auction sites&quot; - I only know that the biggest (and only noteworthy) one is Yahoo! Auctions Japan (often referred to as YAJ). The &quot;agents&quot; are usually called a &quot;proxy bid service&quot; or &quot;bid agent&quot;, and there are a few which charge varying amounts of commission. There's a <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/pub?key=0AjsoMtje_lprdFc5N05RQWI3NWdDLUpvTlBSc1djV3c&amp;output=html" class="postlink">Google Docs spreadsheet</a> which compares them and has some meaningful notes on some of the services.<br /><br />That said, when I was looking for my AV Famicom I didn't exactly get the impression they were that hard to find or particularly expensive on eBay. I found a practically mint condition AV Famicom (without box) for €165 including shipping. I'm not up to speed on what the going price of these is supposed to be but I didn't find it a particularly expensive purchase considering the amazing condition. The console itself hasn't yellowed at all (the top is the exact same colour as the bottom / inside). The dogbone controllers did show yellowing but it was trivial to Retr0bright them, and I happened to be Retr0brighting arcade stick cases anyway so I just did them along with that batch.<br /><br />My advice for looking on eBay (for anything, really -- not just consoles or Famicoms in particular) is to use the most generic search term you can think of (so if you want a Famicom console, just search for &quot;famicom&quot;, nothing more). Select worldwide sellers, and sort by price + shipping, lowest first. In the case of pricier items you can set a minimum price of like $50 to avoid having to trawl through pages and pages worth of $5 Famicom games. It will still take some time to go through all the listings for rarer game cartridges, accessories, etc.; but my experience shows that the best bargains are usually very poorly listed with very few keywords. So the more you add to your search terms, like &quot;console&quot; or model numbers like &quot;HVC-101&quot;, the more likely you are to miss out on that one dude who just wants to sell his console for a reasonable price.

Not only it would be cheaper than getting Famicom, but Pegasus and Dendy are actually better than genuine famicom with more resource-heavy games that would cause slowdowns on Famicom. Also Pegasus/Dendy came with both SCART and red/yellow cinch cables, so it also looks good.<br /><br />Dendy and Pegasus are the only famiclones I'm aware of that doesn't do &quot;NES on a chip&quot; thing and use genuine parts, so yeah.

The Dendy is in fact better adapted for PAL than the actual PAL NES is, but since most games weren't adjusted for 50Hz they'll feel sluggish even if there are no lag frames, and music notes in NTSC games will play at the wrong frequencies. So no, I don't think these clones are better options than an original Famicom.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">Dendy and Pegasus are the only famiclones I'm aware of that doesn't do &quot;NES on a chip&quot; thing and use genuine parts, so yeah.</div><br />Not using a NOAC doesn't necessarily mean genuine parts, which can only be found in consoles made by Nintendo, so Pegasus and Dendy are definitely not genuine. Several older Famiclones (even though I'm using this term, many had 72-pin cartridge slots, or even both kinds of slots) sold here in Brazil such as the Phantom System, the Turbo/Top Game and the Bit System (this one is remarkably similar to the NES) had individual chips for the CPU and PPU as well, and are reportedly much better than NOAC clones, to the point where they even work with the PowerPak. But that doesn't make them any more genuine. AFAIK, these clones use the UMC UA65XX chips, which may or may not be exact replicas of the original Ricoh chips.
