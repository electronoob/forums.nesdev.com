<br />How much more difficult would it be for you to add a NES-side browser, so that you could run a PC-side server program that serves files from a specified directory on the PC to the NES-side browser, which downloads them from the PC and then triggers a reset via software?  The benefit would be that people could use a small mini-itx like headless PC that is setup to simply serve files to the NES.  It is less of a developer friendly feature and more of a user friendly feature, as it lets you have unlimited storage space, yet the userinterface is done through the NES.

<br />
<br />Alright, that's cool.  I might as well describe what they do too, since saying '7400' doesn't say much, heheh.
<br />
<br />74HCT139 - dual 2-to-4 line decoder.  Half of it is used to enable WRAM, the other half is used to enable mapper writes.
<br />
<br />74HCT00 - quad NAND gate.  It does 3 seperate things.  One NAND gate is used to invert the PRG R/W signal (to give PRG /RD).  Another NAND gate is used to enable the 74hct139, when PRG-ROM isn't being accessed and the 'Phi2' signal is high.
<br />The other 2 NAND gates in this chip are used to force the CHR-RAM to a certain bank when the NES accesses nametable memory.  At any other time it'll use whatever bank is selected by the PIC.
<br />
<br />74HC374 - latches the NES's lower address bits during a mapper write, and holds it for the PIC.  I had some trouble with it on the rev2 board, since I changed it's clocking method (still not fully tested on rev2).
<br />
<br />74HC04 - inverter, only used on rev1 for the latch circuit.
<br />
<br />AM29F040B - Flashrom for PRG.
<br />
<br />62256 x 2 - SRAMs for WRAM and CHR.
<br />
<br />And of course, the PIC18F4525 microcontroller.  It can work with cheaper PICs too, but I went for one with the best capability (alot easier to code for too, compared to the 16F family).

There's also the MIDI receiver, but it can't be selected at the same time as the RS232.  The latch was supposed to be able to get the lowest 8 address bits, but initially it seems to not be clocking properly.  So if the latch doesn't work, rev1 software would take some minor code changes to run on rev2.  Unless I do a 3rd version of the rev2 layout, which I'd rather not just yet, heheh.<br /><br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">How much more difficult would it be for you to add a NES-side browser, so that you could run a PC-side server program that serves files from a specified directory on the PC to the NES-side browser, which downloads them from the PC and then triggers a reset via software?

<br />
<br />That's something I want to do also, but probably not initially.  I thought I would try to work this kind of function into a program like ucon64, so the NES can just use the PC hardrive like it's own disk system.  When it happens, it'll be handled by the Squeedo BIOS.  So any program besides the menu should also be able to load/save it's own files.

<br />Recommendations?

<br />
<br />One of these ICD2 clones (the red pcb one).
<br /><a href="http://search.ebay.com/ICD2" class="postlink">http://search.ebay.com/ICD2</a>
<br />
<br />If you search for "ICD2 clone schematics" you can find the info to build a similar one, but it does require a PIC on the programmer itself.
<br />
<br />I tried the low-cost route (JDM programmer and Willem), problem is that the free software for those don't support the newer PICs.  I guess they might in the future, I dunno though.  With an ICD2, you can program any chip that's supported by MPLAB.
<br />
<br />But if you only need one chip to work with, it could be cheapest to find someone to put a bootloader on one for you.  That's how I got started before buying a real programmer.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />You know, I just realized that the Squeedo cart uses RS232 for connecting to a PC.  This has one huge benefit over using a parallel port instead: there are USB to RS232 adapters.  Of course it might require some additional software on the PC side of things, but at least that makes it more future-friendly.  Computers are starting to lack RS232 and parallel ports, and Macs surely do not have them.  USB, however, should be a common feature on computers for a long time.

Route, move chips, find a better way, move chip(s), reroute, notice the board can be smaller, move chips, repeat.. heheh.  It's a bit overkill, but I like it. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />
<br />
<br />My UNROM cart has it's logic on the back of the board, I don't think I've taken any pics of that though.  It's about the same size as a Nintendo NROM board, tiny.
