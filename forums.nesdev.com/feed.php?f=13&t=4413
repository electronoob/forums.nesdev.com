We wouldn't even need a mod that allows notes to administrator. I'd prefer to make a single forum that any registered user can post in, called "Introductions". A coherent introduction would result in privileges. I'm ready to open a straw poll in another topic.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=9">tepples</a> — Sun Aug 23, 2009 11:16 am</p><hr />

Koitsu:<br /><br />I really don't know squat about phpBB so I based my judgment on the date of the page. If we could upgrade without too much hassle to 2.0.23, I guess it would be enough for now.  This way, we could use the note to admin "plugin", if we can call it that way.<br /><br /><br /><br />@Tepples:<br />I think there is no 100% fail safe way to make sure the person that will register is not a spammer. You have to use your own judgment based on the message for the note to admin. If it seems the intention of the user is nes oriented, we have to give them a chance. A bot will not post something that make sense. A human spammer, he will have to be creative a little bit.  <br /><br />Of course it's not 100% sure no spammer will try to post spam but still better than the current situation. Worst situation, if the spam degenerate after that, we can go with Koitsu suggestion. But for now I would still prefer a solution that is less drastic then this one, unless we have no choice.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3559">Banshaku</a> — Sun Aug 23, 2009 5:15 am</p><hr />

The whole concept of what I described **is** that it requires administrators to confirm/deny applications for an account with posting ability.  All existing automated methods (CAPTCHAs, etc.) have been defeated.<br /><br />Regarding phpBB version: the copyright logo, AFAIK, has nothing to do with the version.  The site uses phpBB 2.0.21, while 2.0.23 happens to be the latest in the 2.0.x series.<br /><br />I realise they're up to 3.x, but I'm certain migrating from one to the next is a pain.  Not to mention, the phpBB installation here has custom modifications to make Unicode work for the non-English forums.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3">koitsu</a> — Fri Aug 21, 2009 8:30 am</p><hr />

I see what you mean but never use these options. I always been against those form saving functionality for security reasons.  So this mean it will be asked on every post. hmm... We should keep it in mind as one possible solution. It seems a little bit drastic but could work if it goes out of hand.<br /><br />I'm no expert for phpbb but one option I saw in <a href="http://www.phpbb.com/community/viewtopic.php?t=427852" class="postlink">this thread</a> is to have a <a href="http://www.phpbb.com/community/viewtopic.php?t=509658" class="postlink">note to admin on admin activation</a>. But this imply that the admin must activate every account, which could be a chore. I don't mind to help for that part.  Bots will not write that note and human spammers must write something that make sense to be able to be activated. Bot could at a later stage write something but since it's a script, it would need to be targeted at nesdev anyway so it should be easy to filter out.  <br /><br />I think this should reduce already a lot of spam but I don't know which version of phpbb we are using right now. The (C) on the front page seems to imply an older version.  It may make it harder for normal users to register but I guess someone that really wants to talks about nes programming and that is not a spammer is able to write a simple text about it.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3559">Banshaku</a> — Fri Aug 21, 2009 2:57 am</p><hr />

They tried all sorts of things, and the entire time I kept telling them the only way to solve the problem was to make the board user/password protected (using HTTP authentication) and if someone wants an account, have someone manually add it (e.g. you had to request an account via Email to the board owner).  There was no automatic process.  All Emails were reviewed by a person.<br /><br />Ultimately they went with this, and from that day forward got absolutely no spam.  Welcome to 2009.<br /></div><br /><br />With today's spam tactics, you cannot have a public forum and hope that it will not be spammed in some way.  I think I reported recently many links to Tepples by pm since they seems to post at night (for the US) and for me it's during the day so I see them while posting..<br /><br />Since Nesdev is a very niche topic I think the only solution is to go with an invite only like Koitsu say.  I know it sucks compared to 1999 but where not in that era anymore.  Time change, so should nesdev.  It just who will do the job of creating the account and reviewing them?  We could always separate the job between a few users to relief Memblers pain.  I don't mind to review some account request when I have time.<br /><br />I don't say to make the forum private.

I kinda miss the days when anonymous posting was allowed.  When the forum first started, I don't think it would have gone anywhere without it (or at least would've been much slower to grow).<br /><br />Considering that the user registration page already has a custom-added question on it, and won't let you register without answering it correctly, I'd think there has to be a human in the loop somewhere (to at least config their bot for this forum).  So I don't see what else could possibly work, besides changing that question very often or taking the very drastic measures that were just mentioned..  Seems like even a completely coded-from-scratch forum would still get spammed eventually.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=10">Memblers</a> — Thu Aug 20, 2009 2:40 pm</p><hr />

We had a similar style of spamming over on the Minimig forums.  After discovering that all the spam was coming from a particular IP range then it was a simple matter to block access from that IP range.  Had the side affect of blocking a (probably) large number of users form a particular ISP in a particular country (it escapes me as to which it was) but the admin decided that the risk of blocking any legit users from said ISP and country was far outweighed by the relief of blocking the spam.<br /><br />Can't say that would be a suitable tactic here tho, considering the greater global presence of NESDev ^_^<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3210">Hojo_Norem</a> — Thu Aug 20, 2009 11:18 am</p><hr />
