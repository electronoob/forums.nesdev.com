What do the rest of pins 45-50 (i.e. $4032 in and $4025 out) read?

And the strange thing is that despite all this, my disks still load perfectly fine and the BIOS also behaves fine; it responds when I press the various switches on the drive and doesn't do anything if there's no disk in the drive.

Does the signal from pin 48 go through the FD7201?... or is this the 2SB941 you were talking about in the very beginning?<br /><br />If it is the same transistor, you should just be able to replace it.</div><br />The 2SB941 is a TO220 transistor which is mounted on a giant heat sink on the power PCB. It seems to take the place of a normal voltage regulator, since it takes in the input voltage from the PSU and puts out both 5V and another voltage (which I think is used for the M5236L regulator, which then turns it into 5V). Why Sharp used this arrangement as opposed to two 7805s and a high amperage PSU I'll never understand. I actually desoldered it just to see if it went bad somehow, then I tested it with my multimeter and it checked out fine. <br /><br />So I guess anything between 7.5 and 8V is the safe limit for the Twin Fami. I don't think having an NESRGB installed helped matters either considering it needs nearly 150 mA of current. That plus the additional load of the disk drive on a 10V PSU pushed the power transistor to its limits rather quickly I suppose.<br /><br />Anyway, $4025.0 goes right into pin 11 on the drive controller so it looks like the FD7201 is the most likely culprit.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />You might be able to bypass the motor driver part of the FD7201. I can't quite tell exactly what the on-drive PCB is doing, but it sounds like the motor driver is probably just the equivalent of a power darlington NPN transistor—after all, high voltage = spin motor. Might want a flyback diode, if there isn't already one.<br /><br />The only picture I've been able to find are the ones on this page: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://famicomworld.com/workshop/tech/famicom-disk-system-fd3206-write-mod/">http://famicomworld.com/workshop/tech/f ... write-mod/</a><!-- m --> which is hard to reverse engineer without seeing the other side.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I didn't see your previous post after your edit. Sorry!<br /><br />I doubt the 4000 series ICs could cause this particular flaw; my understanding is that they interfere with the &quot;write requested&quot; line, not the &quot;motor spins&quot; line. (obviously, documentation here is lacking, and without knowing what signals enter into both headers in your photos, I can only really go on hearsay)<br /><br />Is the motor connected Vsupply—motor—FD7201? If so, it should be pretty easy to see if the relevant output pin is held low despite the 2C33 not requesting that. (A sustained slight overvoltage could have caused too much current to flow through the driver in the FD7201, blowing it out... in this case, apparently to &quot;always on&quot;). As I said before, you should be able to use a TIP120 power darlington or a a NTP60N60L power MOSFET or (although it's overkill) a L293D H-bridge driver.
