		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Hello, I just joined recently here and I am not sure if this is the right place for tor this topic. Is there anyone here can help me find Panzer Fly Car, which is a Road Fighter hack? I only found this with one of my roomates who liked nes games like me loool. However, I found some youtube videos of it but not the actual rom. Also, there is a mario hack that I am looking for called&quot;panda mario&quot; in  this hack you can choose any level you want and the music is little bit different.<br /><br />Thank you and I apreciate your patience with me

Again, that games originates from bootleg cartridges from the early 2000's. I've seen somebody mention the 123 in 1 cartridge has it, but there's probably thousands of different versions of those.<br /><br /><br /><br />Too bad, looks like a fun bootleg...<br /><br />Dying to play it since I love Road Fighter.

Too bad. I also used to love ROad Fighter and I remember I used to play it in a multicart that I used to have. I found the cart here with loool. I'm glad that I am not the only one who is looking for that game as a rom. Thanks for explaining and we still waiting for that.

I just saw it with one of my friends and after seeing the romhacking.net site, I think that it could be one of those new pirate carts which has pandamar as well as Panzer Fly Car. I'm not sure though. I hope someone here sees the post and dump it as a rom. I found a file for some of the pirate carts as a torrent. Sadly, I don't feel comfortable downloading torrent.
