I thought SCV4 was excellent. Control particularly was solid. CV DX has much stiffer handling particularly in jumping but just in general whip control. Both are great games though. CV DX probably has more animation but it also benefits from twice as much ROM storage.

It's really a great game, and had amazing graphics considering it came out in 1991 when the SNES was brand new (okay it was released in 1990 but not many game were released that year). It also does the best use of mode 7 of any platformer I had to play on the SNES.

<br />This is something I've noticed on my TV as well.  Even with the "Game" mode enabled on the TV settings, it's still happening...
<br />
<br />I see it on games like Punch Out Wii...  I've seriously considered putting my 1994 CRT back in because of things like this.
<br />
<br />An NES hooked up to the thing doesn't provide as clear a picture when fast animations are going on.
<br />
<br />Movies become nicer to watch, but games certainly don't become nicer to play.

<br />
<br />I keep around a Sony PVM with RGB input for my old consoles such as NES, SNES, Genesis, Saturn, and PS1.

<br />One thing that might help is plugging a component cable into your Wii console and then setting your Wii to progressive display. Monster's Wii cable was in fact cheaper than Nintendo's, which I honestly didn't expect out of Monster. At least on my Vizio TV, upscaler lag disappears once the source is 480p or higher.

<br />
<br />Don't really see how Tokumaru having Portuguese as his first language matter, really. His English skills seems to be quite good from what I can gather.  
<br />Anyway, context sensitivity FTW! :-)

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I love both games, mostly for nostalgic purposes. Even if games are crappy, I usually enjoy them just because they bring me back to a time long gone =)!
<br />
<br />But seriously, I don't think either of these games are crappy. Dracula X has cool levels, nice graphics, but pretty annoying controls. The worst part is that 4-screen segment right before dracula where you're trying to ride the moving platform, kill the medusa heads, AND kill the Axe Man at the end. That is SO annoying. Besides that, I guess the hardest part would be dracula himself, haha. I've seriously never fought a harder version of dracula. Once you get him to his demon form after about 10 minutes, be prepared to basically die. Either by getting knocked off the edge, damaged by him twice, or jumping to your miserable death trying to dodge him. I found really the only way to win is get 99 hearts, save them all for the end, and use the super power of the crucifix subweapon and kill him in 4 uses of that. This is my own solution I made, I'm sure there's some easier way on youtube you could look up.
<br />
<br />Rondo of Blood is way better though. In all aspects.
<br />
<br />Castlevania 4 on the other hand, has some pretty nice controls. The graphics are a bit worse, but I agree with Bregalad I like the Mode 7 parts. It really adds a cool element to the game. Also, there are more levels and replay value than in Dracula X. And while Dracula X offers the ability to use superpowered subweapons, CV4 has other strategic elements that aren't found in Dracula X like the mode 7 parts and whip-swinging.
<br />
<br />I'd probably say CV4 is overall a better game because you can get more out of it, but I think I enjoy them equally and for different reasons. Like I said before, mostly because of nostalgia.

<br />
<br />On the case of SC4, I thought it was delayed because Konami broke Mr. Belmont up between 10 dma loads and couldn't move him until the dma loads were finished.
