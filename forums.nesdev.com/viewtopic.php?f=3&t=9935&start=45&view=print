There's literally hundreds possibly thousands of NES emulators existing in some form or another. I think it's cool that he's trying something new. Also, this isn't a &quot;filter&quot; ala HQ2x, it's a method for replacing graphics using graphics packs. Also, some of us may take offense to the word &quot;fag&quot; being used in a derogatory manner. I would suggest not posting again unless you have something constructive to say. Thanks.

If you want to enhance a game, then enhance its gameplay, not just its graphics, rebuild it entirely from scratch. Changing just the graphics is entirely vain.<br /><br />And btw you're one thousand years too young to lecture me little padawan.

The last thing this forum needs is trouble of this sort, as it often today escalates into something much worse.  Please don't let that happen.<br /><br />Consider this a public warning.

I guess I overreacted after seeing yet another one (the straw that broke the camel's back) of these annoying &quot;emulation&quot; news about some vainglorious graphic filters. I did not come to just start shit, I'm stating my opinion and reacting to this long filtering trend, is all. No trolling there, just different opinions stated a bit roughly, I you can't take that, you need to man up a little.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I think X-or is focusing on the NES part of emulation and I'm focusing on the game part of the emulation.<br /><br />Maybe I should say this from the very beginning: I make this emulator for fans to express their love for their fav games. Some people do this by speed running the games, some by making a LP for the games, some by translating the games, rom-hacking, writing a walkthrough, make a website etc. However, not everyone have that kind of skill. And on the N64 emulator or PC, people can also make graphics pack for the games, much like adding a custom paint job to their fav car. And this is how I want my emulator to be, another way for the fans to express and share their love for the games. <br /><br />X-or, I apologize if you feel offended because I make an emulator to deviate from a real NES on purpose. I do respect your love for the NES and I hope you can understand my point of view. Thank you.<br /><br />rainwarrior, I think the OpenGL started, but the GLSL code has problem running. Which OpenGL version or graphics card are you using?

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Don't get discouraged by the naysayers. Fortunately for them there are already many emulators available that provide a traditional NES experience. <br /><br />Providing support for more colors and a higher resolution is a very cool idea that many will embrace. Have you considered publishing a standard for how the increased colors and resolution are implemented? This way other emulators could eventually adopt it and people would be more likely to create graphics packs.
