		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />For my game, I have someone who creates the graphics for me since I can't draw very well.<br />Unfortunately, I cannot compose music either. So, if I tried to create a soundtrack on the NES or, you know, any machine or instrument, it would probably sound horrible.<br /><br />That's why I'm asking here: Where can I get someone who creates the music for my game? Are there people on this forum who are generally willing to collaborate on homebrew games? Or are there people out there who regularly do this kind of stuff?<br /><br />I have no idea whatsoever who could be contacted for this. So, I'm grateful for any advice. Either for geneal suggestions about who does this kind of stuff. Or if someone here actually would be willing to work specifically on the music to my game.<br /><br />By the way, in case you need the details: It would need to be some small soundtrack that &quot;quietly&quot; plays in the background. Nothing too fancy. It shouldn't be as monotonous as in &quot;Kung Fu&quot;, but it doesn't need to be as advanced as the original &quot;Super Mario Bros.&quot; theme.<br />I'd need:<br />- One general soundtrack that plays in all levels.<br />- One jingle for the intro sequence.<br />- A soundtrack for boss battles. (Or maybe also just a jingle for the beginning.)<br />- Ending jingle.<br />- Pause jingle.<br />- Jingle when you lose a life.<br />- Game over jingle.<br /><br />And some sound effects:<br />- When you get hit.<br />- When you attack. (Here, I'd need an electric sound because the opponents are shocked with a taser.)<br />- Maybe jumping and falling sounds. (Not cartoony like in &quot;Mario&quot;, more like the sound of the feet moving away and towards the ground.)

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />For the level, I only have my shitty placeholder graphics.<br /><br />As for the general mood:<br />The game plays on the rooftops of skyscrapers with an industrial city in the background. (Skysrapers, factories, cranes etc.)<br />You play a 24 year old woman with a taser and you fight against a gang of thugs.<br />It has pieces of comic book stuff in it, like an enemy with rocket shoes who freely flies all over the place. But all in all, it's set in the real world. So, no turtles or aliens to fight, only regular human beings.<br />Also, it's not science fiction or supposed to play in the future. The game, if this even matters, will be set in the mid-80s, probably 1986.<br />The graphics are neither overly cartoony (&quot;Mario&quot;), nor totally serious and &quot;realistic&quot; (&quot;Contra&quot;, &quot;Castlevania&quot;). Think of the characters from &quot;Kung Fu&quot;, &quot;Soccer&quot; and suitless Samus from the NES &quot;Metroid&quot;: No super deformed exaggerated chibi cartoon look. But the head is still recognizable enough that you can see the eyes and partly the mouth.<br /><br />By the way, I'm not expecting anybody to compose a melody right now. First I have finish the game to see how much room will be left for the music. (Since it's supposed to run on a standard 32 + 8 KB NROM board.)<br /><br />So, I'm just asking to either get to know general places where people take these kinds of jobs. Or to find somebody who is actually interested in working specifically for my game. But he wouldn't need to do anything <em>now</em>. I just need someone where I know that he would create a soundtrack under the condition that I get back to him within the next 2.5 months. (I'm planning to have the game finished by the end of the year.)<br /><br />Which means, there will be plenty of time where I can present the finished graphics to the person.<br /><br />If anybody has any further questions about the game, I'd be happy to tell you about it.
