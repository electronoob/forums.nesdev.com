If so, that'd mean games like DK ripped from WiiWare with bus issues wouldn't have happened like they did when RetroUSB released it, but people had problems on their NES's. And then the same with the powerpak, why did they need to add pull ups there? They aren't there AFAIK.
<br />
<br />And what would be those "obscure ways" and why would it work different from an NTSC NES? Are the physics in europe different or did they change the console? heh.

<br />
<br />Didn't Nintendo add some diodes to NES and SNES controller inputs to make sure NTSC controllers would not work on PAL machines ? 
<br />
<br />I remember that removing the diodes would solve the issue on the SNES case. Would the NES have something similar ?
<br />
<br />3gengames:
<br />As per bus issues, what have an emulated game to do with open bus problems ? And yes I guess you are right about the pullups as I have my NES open here for some testing with CVBS circuit and I had a check after reading your post. 
<br />
<br />The Pullup resistors were for the controller port buffers. -_-;

The NTSC controller does not so it won't work on a PAL system.  A PAL controller on NTSC system works fine.  Not something a cart can detect.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">3gengames wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">If so, that'd mean games like DK ripped from WiiWare with bus issues wouldn't have happened like they did when RetroUSB released it, but people had problems on their NES's.</div><br />That was bus conflicts, not open bus.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">3gengames wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">And then the same with the powerpak, why did they need to add pull ups there? </div>
<br />Voltage conversion.
<br />
<br />A relatively easy way to deal with clones would be the CHR /A13 -&gt; CIRAM /CE connection.  Almost all clones expect those 2 pins to be connected, which is why games like Rad Racer fail.  Would need some weird electronics to be able to detect that and have the game still run.

<br />Including an authentic Game Boy Advance manufactured by Nintendo and running PocketNES?
