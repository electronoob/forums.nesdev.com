I've been trying to build my own game that involves throwing objects/calculating trajectories with vectors and matrices however, I've been struggling to get it work. It has been a bit too long for me to recall on them and math was never really my strongest subject. The tutorials I've found on YouTube aren't close enough to what I want to do with my game. I tried just creating it myself with some math tutorials like <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/math/precalculus/vectors-precalc" class="postlink">KhanAcedemy</a>, <a href="http://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/" class="postlink">Paul's Online Notes</a>, and <a href="https://www.studypug.com/basic-math-help/multiplying-and-dividing-integers/divide-integers" class="postlink">Study Pug</a> but I am quite lost at the moment and can't get it work. Do you guys know any websites closely tied to developing games? That would be lots of helps to me and others looking to start building their first game.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I think math is certainly important in video game development (and also many games other than video games too), although what kind of math is important is difference depending on what kind of game. I did not find math a difficult subject though; it is easier to understand than language arts and social studies and so on. Also, I do not know the websites closely tied to developing games, as mostly I have figured out the things by myself, looking up stuff on Wikipedia and so on when I was unsure.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />It depends on the type of game, but I do feel a basic understanding of math and physics helps. While working on a Zelda-type game, everything was very simple and basic. On the other hand, a platformer project was a lot more complex. Some of that was by choice, such as having elastic collisions instead of simple ejections. It's really a matter of how far you want to take the simulation vs approximating things.

If you don't have one already, make a sine/cosine table because it's essential for some more complicated (but still relevant) problems.<br /><br />Now, with 3D graphics, it's probably a whole other story...

That doesn't mean it's not useful or applicable. If you don't know what you don't know, it might be hard to see what you could have used from it. Understanding more math can give you a lot of tools to work with that might do a job better or more easily.<br /><br />Like, someone can give you a recipe for a parabolic jump, by adding acceleration to velocity to position. That's fine at first, but when you need to modify it, analyze it, do something more complicated... it can make the difference between tweaking values all night until the curve &quot;looks&quot; the way you want (and possibly giving up), and being able to just dictate a curve that, e.g. passes through specific points, has the velocity you want at those points, stays in the air for a specific amount of time, is attracted to a moving magnet, etc... or sometimes it helps to know if it's actually <em>impossible</em> to build the curve you're asking for. Instead of a long period of trial and error, then giving up, you might have realized much sooner that you should try something else.<br /><br />Here's a basic list of areas of math that I think are pretty useful to games. This is also pretty much the same categories of math you'd find as requirements for a general Computer Science degree:<br /><br /><ul><li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometry" class="postlink">Geometry</a> - The basic stuff of shapes, angles, measurement, etc. Trigonometry, i.e. understanding angles and circles has a lot of applications elsewhere too.</li><li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_algebra" class="postlink">Linear Algebra</a> - Especially important for geometry, intersections, collision, motion, etc. Matrices and other methods to understand the relationship between 1D, 2D, 3D, and higher dimensions.</li><li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calculus" class="postlink">Calculus</a> - Useful for anything to do with curves, motion, curved surfaces, shapes. Relationships between surface are and volume, questions about how much or how long for various processes that happen over time. (Combined with Linear Algebra this is kind of the backbone of a lot of 3D rendering topics.)</li><li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrete_mathematics" class="postlink">Discrete Math</a> - If Calclus deals with smooth, continuous curves, Discrete Math is instead individual steps. Integers. Graphs and connections. Ways of dealing with collections of things. Insights into modular arithmetic.</li><li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics" class="postlink">Statistics &amp; Probability</a> - Probability, tendencies, odds, expectations. Not just making a prediction but having an idea of how reliable it is. Extremely applicable to AI, and provides a lot of tools for analysis. (Strongly correlated with Discrete Math as well.)</li><li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-order_logic" class="postlink">Formal Logic</a> - Sometimes is just really helps to be able to work through logic mechanically.</li></ul><br />All of these are well worth developing a basic understanding of. Eventually the deeper stuff becomes more specialized and less generically applicable, but the foundation level of each of these topics is very practical knowledge.

So basically a computer is a glorified calculator and so you really have to understand maths. Putting numbers in and out of A,X and Y is Algebra. Boolean Algebra is the only way you can understand AND/OR/EOR BNE/BEQ/BCC/BCS/BPL/BMI etc<br /><br />If you want a smaller target set, taking what rainwarrior said, I would put Boolean Algebra and Linear Algebra as the &quot;must&quot; haves, and then the others are &quot;as needed&quot;.

Less will always be inaccurate and more won't buy you anything. (I'm not counting collision response because you generally don't want that to be accurate anyway, for gameplay reasons. Most players would like to stay on the ground unless they press jump.)<br /><br />But for the NES I agree it's probably overkill. You can't beat Euler for simplicity.
