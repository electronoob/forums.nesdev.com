When I went netbook shopping I opted for the Gateway Netbook with a 1.2 Ghz Athlon 64. It runs windows 7 just fine and it does Snes emulators just fine. Although I sometime can tell it's single core, it performs as if it were a 2ghz machine at least. I'm well pleased with it. I've seen a few Atom based netbooks that my customers have and I'm glad I went with the Athlon. I want to try it with a 64bit windows but I don't like the prospect of formatting it just to switch to a 64bit OS.<br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://gizmodo.com/5300552/gateway-lt3100-netbook-runs-an-amd-athlon-processor-led-backlit-11+inch-screen-and-multitouch">http://gizmodo.com/5300552/gateway-lt31 ... multitouch</a><!-- m --><p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=493">Super-Hampster</a> — Sun May 02, 2010 7:36 pm</p><hr />

The add-on chips (SuperFX, SA-1) would be pretty much impossible to interface to properly through a cart adapter, given the aforementioned port rate issues.<br /><br />Merging the video from a SuperFX in properly would also be a goddawful mess, as that's going to be running even faster.<br /><br />For anything else, the added instructions don't have much of an effect, as the bulk of the added cost is in decoding teh address to figure out what to do with it (have to find out when the code is writing to PPU registers for instance) and the added cost is so miniscule as to not be worth mentioning. Adding a couple of instructions to the access, when you're burning a million+ cycles on PPU+APU+CPU emulation is completely meaningless.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=8">ReaperSMS</a> — Fri Apr 30, 2010 1:56 pm</p><hr />

The vast majority of the CPU time bsnes uses does not have to do with the cartridge.

The Retrode seems to be simpler than that.  I think basically all it has to do is read the whole cartridge sequentially a single time.  After that the device would probably do nothing except wait for the emulator to write a save file.<br /><br />CopyNES can do that already, but it's not conveniently automated like that.  You also have to know what mapper you're dealing with, which is mostly a problem unique to the NES because of the hundreds of different boards.<br /><br />That's way easier too than making some kind of super high-speed add-on card for a PC (though it would be cool).<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=10">Memblers</a> — Thu Apr 29, 2010 7:11 pm</p><hr />
