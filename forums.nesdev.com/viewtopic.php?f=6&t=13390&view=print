		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I'm working on the Nerdy Nights NES sound tutorial and I've learned how various streams may share the sound channels.<br />For example, the music uses all channels, but when a sound effect is playing, that channel skips playing its music track and plays the sound effect instead. Then it resumes playing the music.<br /><br />Now my question: How did the &quot;small&quot;, arcade-like NES games around 1985/1986 do this? Did many of them also use all four channels for the music, skipping the music streams when sound effects were played?<br />Or did they declare right from the beginning that music only plays on Square 1, Square 2 and Triangle while sound effects play only on Noise?<br />I'm asking because my own game shall mimic an old highscore/arcade-like game from around 1986.<br /><br />So, let's take, for example &quot;Super Mario Bros.&quot;, &quot;Kung Fu&quot; and &quot;Ice Climber&quot;: Which of the described methods did they use? Channel sharing or playing music only on three streams and sounds on the last one?

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Looking at SMB, it uses all 4 channels to play most of the songs. Some sound effects also share Square 1, some share square 2, some share the noise channel. It loads the sound effect into the sound register when a sound effect is triggered, with a timer that counts down. When the timer is 0, the music resumes for that channel. It does this while continuing the song on the other channels. Songs are broken into segments. Each segment looks about 80 bytes, some songs have 1 segment (time is running out song). Some songs have 4 or so segments.<br /><br />I don't know every NES game, but (i think) generally the music data is uncompressed... but frequently use clever ways to reduce length (like reusing data for multiple songs).

For example: How many bytes in the ROM does the standard melody of &quot;Super Mario Bros.&quot; occupy and what methods were used to compress it?</div><br />If you find NSF rips, a lot of them are reduced to roughly just the music code and data. At worst it's an upper bound on the total amount of music stuff in the game, at best it's really close to containing only the music stuff (depends on how concerned the ripper was with removing unused data, and how it was organized in the ROM).<br /><br />As far as knowing how the data is formed, that's really something you'd have to do a lot of reverse engineering to learn. Most music engines seem to work by having some kind of set of &quot;instrument&quot; data defining how to play a note (e.g. volume envelope, duty settings, etc.) and then a set of &quot;notes&quot; for each channel as the music data. Generally a note will be a byte, possibly followed by another byte saying how long to wait until the next note, and then other bytes can signify other things as needed (change of instrument, change of volume, repetition of block, etc.)<br /><br />The most common &quot;compression&quot; technique, other than reducing empty space between notes to a single value (i.e. basically a form of RLE), is repetition. Organizing the music into short patterns that can be repeated and reused, and some data structure that lets the composer do the repetition.<br /><br />With the popularity of Famitracker, a lot of people base their music around standard tracker ideas of &quot;pattern&quot; and &quot;order&quot;, which can accomplish the repetition task in a limited way. When I <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/viewtopic.php?f=6&amp;t=12040" class="postlink">disassembled Startropics' music code</a>, I discovered that it had a rather simple system allowing 256 bytes of data per channel in a song, and it simply had control bytes to jump back and forth in the data, or repeat a section a set number of times, etc. I documented that format in the disassembly if you want to take a peek at how it was done in that game.<br /><br />If you search RHDN for music hacks, you might find some documentation on the music data used in other NES games.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Instruments define how the notes will sound. Normally they're simply a set of duty/volume/etc parameters that get applied to the note every frame. The frequency can also be manipulated, using the note's frequency as reference, for other kinds of effects (arpeggios, slides and the like). Instrument changes are normally triggered by commands in the song data.<br /><br />There are more compact sound formats that use a single byte to specify both the note and its length. This reduces the number of notes and lengths you can use, but you can use commands to select different octaves or length tables.<br /><br />I don't think any games did what you're describing with the channels. Noise is often used for drums, which would definitely be missed if absent from the songs. At the same time, the type of sound generated by the noise channel is not suitable for all kinds of special effects. The game would sound very dull.

This way, I don't have to include such a function in my sound engine and I don't have to check for a &quot;volume changed&quot; flag. Unless of course the music sounds crappy this way.

If you listen closely to many NES songs you'll find that the volume of a note will gradually drop as it plays, sometimes faster (a staccato effect), sometimes slower (a more melodic effect) depending on the effect desired. To make it simple in your engine, allow the selection of an initial volume and a decay rate (that could be done in a single byte). That alone will make for a pretty decent sounding music engine. Additionally, allowing the pitch of a note to change as its played gives you more effects like the sweep up and down (that Megaman uses often) and a gradual oscillation of the pitch (a vibrato effect). These can be implemented as a list of signed values that are gone through to add to the current pitch to achieve the effect. The duty cycle should be allowed to be changed too, at least on an instrument by instrument basis.
