Also, there will be visible corruption on-screen between the 3rd and 4th writes if you change fine X.<br /><br />If you don't change fine X, consider the faster PPUADDR-only method.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Is there some reason you're trying to find the hardest way to do everything? Zelda didn't need MMC5 or use complicated scrolling tricks. Learning how to use them is cool and all, but it can also be a form of procrastination. One way artists spark creativity is to force some kind of limitation... Today I'm only going to use blues. Embrace the limitations, say to yourself, &quot;I can make it work with only 4 palettes for background&quot; <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />&quot;Procrastination&quot; because you spend all your time solving technical problems rather than programming your game.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Actually, The Legend of Zelda did use complicated scrolling tricks, to put their own HUD at the top of the screen - if you want a HUD at the top that doesn't scroll, but your game uses vertical scrolling, you have to. Zelda used sprite-0 collision instead of the MMC5 scanline IRQ, but in the end the technique is basically the same.<br /><br />And as I've mentioned before, I am not going to be the artist on this, and I can't guarantee that the artist will be amazing at limited-color and limited-tile pixel art, so I'm trying to make their job as easy as possible. And why wouldn't I, when I'm doing this in my spare time? I have no deadlines, and at worst I end up with a good general reusable MMC5 game engine with some nice special tricks.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Darn, I just ran into a technical limitation I hadn't realized: just how little time there is per vblank on NES. Only being able to update a couple rows of chars per frame while still updating other things like sprites throws my 4-row HUD under a bus if I want vertical scrolling, since I'd have to update all 4 rows plus the actual scroll-reveal row every scroll update. I can't get around it by keeping the HUD on another nametable, because when using MMC5 extended mode all nametables share the same extended palette/char table. <br /><br />The only solution I can think of that doesn't involve dropping extended mode or the BG HUD is to use the MMC5 vertical split for a side HUD, but that would be insane (and I'd lose my extra HUD palette). That or turn the HUD off during scrolls, which seems rather janky (admittedly, with the Zelda-style scrolling I had planned on it's not as bad, but still janky).

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Lots of games have glitch free status bars combined with bidirectional scrolling. Some of them use name table layout tricks, but since you seem to be stuck with a single name table (unless it's indeed possible to disable extended attributes for part of the screen, and you're OK with that) I think that the solution that would work best in your case is the solution used in Crystalis: simply use mapper IRQs to skip the hud during the rendering of the playfield, and always keep it in the same place. Look at a name table viewer while playing some Crystalis and you'll see how it works.

If you pause, you can see that whatever is right above and right below the status bar in the name table connect directly in the final render. Also notice that there's a blank row above the status bar in the final render, so that the gameplay window can scroll smoothly without glitches.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">dougeff wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">Crystalis is a great example, but it does have those attribute table glitches I mentioned.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I think I see, don't just use the scanline IRQ once for the HUD at the top of the screen, but also a second and third time to adjust hardware scrolling to show the lines above the HUD as if they were directly connected to lines below the HUD. Tricksy hobbitses! Sounds like a plan...<br /><br />Disabling extended attributes while rendering a HUD on a second nametable is something I considered trying and might actually work (the HUD is all on char bank 0 and only using one palette), but pushing MMC5 that way is a dangerous thing to do when I don't actually have access to the hardware I'm developing for yet, to test how that MMC5 implementation handles it. The way I'm testing now I've got four emulators, and if what I'm doing doesn't look mostly the same on all four, then chances are I'm doing something wrong or dangerous even if one of the four is doing exactly what I want. As long as I'm not doing anything tricky/out of the ordinary for MMC5 I should be fine with this testing method, worst case is I might need to tweak timing a bit once I can get the game on hardware.
