Always been happy with the PCBs I got from him.

It wouldn't be difficult for anyone with adequate skill set and resources to make such a device.  Creating a device of this nature would be a conflict of my interests.  In doing so I would effectively be saying, &quot;Don't bother buying well made cartridges from myself or my reputable peers.  Instead buy this device once and safely enjoy a lifetime of purchasing cheap chinese junk!&quot;  There's no motivation for me to make such a device.<br /><br />If you're really looking to play cheap chinese carts 'safely' I would recommend playing on a low end clone as they typically don't operate at 5v, and are more likely to be at safer voltage levels for 3v hardware.  Not only that, if a cheap clone console gets damaged from a cheap cart, it's not worth crying over.
