<br />
<br />WedNESday, there were a thousand ways you could have said this should be in the newbie forum, but you just had to choose the most unpleasant, didn't you?
<br />
<br />In fact you didn't have to say anything. The question was already answered. But it seems you get a real kick out of calling people stupid, for some reason.
<br />
<br />And I've seen 6502 documents state that, for example, after an ASL command the Z flag would be set always based on the value in the A register. Look <a href="http://www.obelisk.demon.co.uk/6502/reference.html#ASL" class="postlink">here</a>. Although after some testing you'd quickly figure otherwise, but I think Anes had a legit question.

<br />
<br />True. But people are very unpleasant to me all of the time, not only on the forum, but also in the real world.

This is hardly the place to discuss this, but maybe you'd be happier if you gave people what you don't get for yourself but wish you did, instead of the opposite.<br /><br />And I've never seen anyone here beeing unpleasant to you, except when you are rude to others, but then you can't really blame them.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">unknown wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">Do unto others as you would have them do unto you</div>
<br />I don't remember where I got that from, but that's a damn good rule. If everyone followed that the world would be a much better place. Of course, there are, for example, masochists, who kinda mess up that rule... O.o
<br />
<br />Anyway, what I mean is, I'm sure you have asked not-so-smart questions before, and the thing you least expected was to be called stupid.

<br />
<br />If the original offender is a lot bigger than you, you might take it out on someone else. See above for the solution.
