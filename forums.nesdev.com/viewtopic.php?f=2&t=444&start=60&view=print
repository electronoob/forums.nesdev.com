<br />
<br />Just save it in the format you think is most efficient to read. Keep in mind that whatever you output from the editor is what your game code (written in 6502 assembly by YOU) is going to read and draw to the screen.
<br />
<br />There are no "standards" for formats, it's all up to you. File extensions don't matter at all, the contents of the files do. Whatever the format you output from the editor, you'll be .incbin'ing it in your code.

Qbasic won't interact with the NES at all, it is just a tool to prepare the level in a format your game code can make good use of.<br /><br />That is the whole deal of the level editor, a better NSA, one that is suited to (and optimized for) the needs of your game.<br /><br />There are tons of mouse routines for qbasic, this shouldn't be hard to find at all, there are so many qbasic sites on the net that carry this kind of stuff... look for it in google and you will surelly find one.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">Celius wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">By the way, what Tile editor was written in Qbasic?<br /></div>
<br />I said I think there is one, I'm not sure, so I can't give you a name. I can say there is an emulator made in qbasic, it's called unessential, look for it in <!-- w --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.zophar.net">www.zophar.net</a><!-- w --> (I think you can find it there). Since it is a NES emulator, it must have code to decode NES graphics somewhere in there.

Take a snapshot, open it in photoshop, copy and paste it into paint, and save it as a .bmp file. Then open YY-Chr, and copy and paste the stuff from paint into YY-Chr. Make sure that there's only 4 colors in the bmp, and make sure they are the following:
<br />
<br />Red
<br />Green
<br />Blue
<br />Black
<br />
<br />When you copy and paste it, whatever's Red will show up as the 4th color on the pallete, whatever's Blue will show up as the second, whatever's Green will show up as the the third, and Black will be the first. I'm sure you all knew that, but I just thought I might share it just in case. I'm sure different rules apply for different systems. But that one for sure works with windows.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />There's an even easier method - use a tile editor that supports opening multiple files (such as Tile Layer Pro) and just drag-and-drop the tiles from one file to the other. This has the added bonus of being able to load tiles from ANYWHERE in the game, not just the ones that happened to be loaded at the time you took the screenshot.
<br />
<br />The only caveat is that this method generally doesn't work with games that use CHR-RAM (since their tile data will likely be compressed somewhat).

Alt+Print Screen takes a snapshot of the current window in FCEU, Nintendulator, and every other "normal" Windows program and puts it on the Windows clipboard. Then you can...<br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">paste it into paint, and save it as a .bmp file. Then open YY-Chr, and copy and paste the stuff from paint into YY-Chr.</div>
<br />I'm working on a program called 'bmp2tiles' that takes any .bmp file and turns it into tiles for 1-bit, GB, SMS, NES, Super NES/PCE, Virtual Boy, Genesis, GBA, or 8-bit packed. (Why Virtual Boy? Many GBA games use 1-bit or Virtual Boy format tiles and expand them to GBA format at runtime using a GBA BIOS call.) And yes, it'll even work with 8x16 pixel sprite mode.

Have you ever read the <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/html_chapter/make_toc.html" class="postlink">GNU Make manual</a>? If you keep the graphics in a .bmp file, which some claim is the most convenient format for making modifications, you can have your makefile automatically rebuild the .chr file whenever necessary. Having the grunt work of data conversion handled behind the scenes can simplify larger projects.

<br />it starts at the top of the screen on Jnes and stuff, but starts on the second line like it should on Nintendulator and FCEUXD. Am I correct when I state that theory that Jnes skips a line?

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Do you have scanline clipping turned off?  The NES renders 240 scanlines, but when emulating NTSC, most emulators chop off the top and bottom 8 scanlines (only rendering 224 scanlines) since the top and bottom are chopped off on most NTSC displays.
<br />
<br />If one emu is chopping off the top 8 lines, and another isn't, it may appear that one is rendering the image lower than the other -- when it really isn't.  One just isn't showing the whole picture.
<br />
<br />Your code is drawing to ppu$2020, so <strong>without</strong> clipping, this will start drawing 8 pixels down from the top of ths screen.  With clipping it will start at the very top of the screen.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />As stated -- most NTSC displays cut off the top and bottom of the screen.  As such, Some games expected that area to not be visible and there's sometimes trash up there which clipping hides.  Can't think of a game offhand which does that, but I know they exist.  Also, look at Final Fantasy without clipping.  Scroll the screen virtically -- see that effect at the top and bottom?  That's an unavoidable problem with Virtical Scrolling + Vertical mirroring.  However clipping hides it nicely.
<br />
<br />Another possible benefit of clipping is that it brings the screen a little closer to 4:3 aspect ratio (though it's still pretty far from it).  So all the people that like stretching the image to fit the screen will have less distortion than they would if all 240 lines were rendered.
<br />
<br />So yeah, I'm pro-clipping -- though most/all emus make it optional so it's easy to flip off if you don't like it.
