The gameboy sound system sometimes makes a popping sound when certain sound features are setup for use by the game. Similar things can happen with the NES sound system. If you increase the 'Frequency' value in the NEZPlug setup file, you can decrease the effect a little. Some valid values to try:<br /><br />32000<br />44100<br />48000<br />88200<br />96000<br /><br />The best number will depend on what your sound card can handle playing back.</div>
<br />
<br />My soundcard resamples everything to 48000 as evidenced by my home theater receiver's report when I use SPDIF.
<br />
<br />Would it be worth the trouble to write WAVs at 48 KHz and downsample them to 44.1 KHz with Audacity if I wanted the best possible sounding audio for a CD?  (I'm guessing no.)

<br />
<br />Okay, this is the type of nitty gritty stuff that I'm interested in.  I've never gotten a very clear answer about all of this.  
<br />
<br />By "renderer," do you mean Winamp's Diskwriter plugin that creates the WAVs?  How would I know the quality of the renderer?  I never knew it was this complicated. 
<br />
<br />I clearly don't understand the sampling process, but wouldn't any quality gains from using 88200 be lost when downsampling to 44100 anyway?  Is Audacity a high quality resampler?
<br />
<br />And of course, is this worth all the trouble?
<br />
<br />So what you're saying is 2 * cheap = high quality?   <img src="./images/smilies/icon_question.gif" alt=":?:" title="Question" />

If there are problems, I expect the people who actually like listening to the GBS to tell me. After all, if nobody cared that I ripped or edited something, who's going to care if it's a little wrong?
<br />
<br />2. The actual internal track values used for PM Yellow's Title Screen(Track 1) are the same as the internal values used for the PM Blue Title Screen. It appears that, when they were editing the system, they replaced the title track with another physical file, and it was used instead. That makes the inclusion of the original title screen music unlikely.

<br />
<br />Okay, it seems the battle songs are mono in-game even when Stereo is selected and the battle sounds are panned according to the attacker and defender.  This is a shame, because Yellow's battle songs are stereo.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />It's not being grumpy that makes me favor new GBSs to existing ones, it's just an understanding. I rip them as well as I can think to at the time, release them if I can't hear anything wrong, and provide tools to help repair them if someone wants to start getting into GBS ripping. If nobody seriously cares about the way a GBS sounds, then the point behind releasing it is moot. If someone does care, and points out an error, I'll almost always investigate it for issues, whether I made it or not.
<br />
<br />I like releasing a fairly large number of GBSs if I can, simply because I'm more likely to enjoy a certain set of music more than I'll enjoy a perfectly optimized set. I'd rather be listening to music than extracting it most of the time. Getting the Game Genie music routines perfectly space optimized was rather difficult, because of the debugging it took.
<br />
<br />Since it takes so much time to really optimize the sets, I choose to go for numbers over perfection.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Now I remember why I never optimize. It causes more errors than the space savings are worth. Turns out one minor issue with the MM2 GBS was that 3(0x03) bytes of trailing 00s were trimmed from the file. Why the hell they were removed is beyond me, but by adding them back in, the first note of several songs now play. Who knows what else was affected by this tiny fraction of missing data. I did a little extra to help reduce data difference for the debugging, but the 3 null bytes had the only noticed effect. Definately not my first guess about the issue or the solution.
<br />
<br />It may play a little better, but you can't overcome some issues if the emulator doesn't play things right to start with.
<br />
<br />It's actually kind of nasty for a Mono GBS. It kept referencing the RST table for sound data, which doubled as coding.
