<br />Interesting. It is linux who does that ? I use it at work and I don't remember it being different from Windows 7. Or maybe I should re-install Linux on my PC to compare what it does ? Anyway this is off topic.

<br />In common desktop Linux environments, just as in Windows, double-clicking a window's title bar toggles it between maximized and normal states. The joke was that my Chrome window was already maximized; double-clicking made it "normal" and therefore smaller.

For example, the EPROM one could mention that A14 also doubles as PGM, and on smaller ones, A15 becomes +5V, and A13 no connection. I tried making a table, but I realized I don't know what the heck that page is describing. Is it telling the pin functions of the chips, or what those pins are wired to on the boards, or both? It states that "For some unknown reasons, unused address lines on smaller ROMs had to be put to +5V". Is this just because those address lines become extra chip select inputs? Also, the pinout suggests that for example pin 20 is a ground line on PRG ROM chips, but is it realls just /CS always selected, with 22 then being an /OE, as with an EPROM?

That's confusing. It should either show the pinout of the chip, which is a list of the behavior of each pin, OR a pinout of the socket/solder holes, which is a list of what each hole is connected to. For example, pin 20 of a PRG ROM, is it /CS, wired to pin 14 inside the chip, or not connected inside the chip? Is the pinout on the page showing that of the chip or that of the socket?<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">As for /CS vs. /OE: is there really a difference between the two for mask ROM chips?

<br />Yes; the time from asserting CS to valid data is greater than from asserting OE. I believe it's because when CS is deasserted, the chip goes into a low power mode. Once CS is asserted, the address lines are then used to internally select the byte and get it ready. Then OE just switches from three-state output. Take a look at a <a href="http://www.alldatasheet.com/datasheet-pdf/pdf/64429/HOLTEK/HT23C020.html" class="postlink">23C020</a> 256Kx8 mask ROM for example, which takes 150ns from CS being asserted, but only 80ns from OE.

<br />Well, Blargg, I must say you raised a very good question ! You are right that we should definitely make some light on this before editing the page for a final (hopefully better) version.
<br />
<br />When I first made the page, by merging multiple diagrams I noticed some were using labels such as "A7" while others using longer labels such as "PRG A7". So I decided to keep the longer labels for EPROM diagrams, so that they indicate not only what the pin is used for, but where it is connected to.
<br />When both are different, for example the /CE pin which is connected to GND, I use GND (/CE).
<br />
<br />The problem, is that for Mask ROMs that have pins connected to VCC or GND, you have no way to know if they are unused chip enable signals or not ! The only way would be to mod a board so that the pin is connected to a switch, and change the switch during gameplay. If the game freezes then chances are this was an extra chip enable pin.
<br />
<br />I have no idea why Nintendo did multiple boards for multiple PRG sizes.
<br />For example, <em>Bugs Bunny's Carzy Castle</em>, which is 64 KB PRG and 32 KB CHR, uses NES-SBROM, while <em>Dr Mario</em> which is 32 KB PRG and 32 KB CHR, uses NES-SEROM.
<br />
<br />The only difference is that A15 becomes VPP, so in theory it would be absolutely no problem to put Dr Mario on a SBROM, A15 would just remain unused and connects to VPP but who cares as VPP is only used during programming. So I have no idea why they had to put it to VCC.
<br />
<br />This is even more obscure considering they could have wathever sized CHR-ROMs in the same slots. For example Testis is 32 KB PRG and only 16 KB CHR, but yet they use a SEROM board like Dr Mario which is 32 KB CHR. It doesn't cause them a problem that A14 (PGM) isn't connected to +5V.
<br />However, you know that Nintendo did different boards for NROM-128 and NROM-256 games, which is in the same case : Why couldn't NROM-128 games work on NROM-256 boards with their unused PGM pin connected to A14 ?
<br />
<br />Fortunately this stopped at 128 KB and above ROMs, leading to less board per family.
<br />
<br />
<br />The datasheet you found is interesting, it shows that unused inputs could be asked to be active low or high chip enables. That's what they used in Wizard &amp; Warriors 2 and some other AOROM boards to prevent bus confilcts.
<br />
<br />I'm not sure if there is a difference between /CE and /OE. On RAMs of course there is a difference (when writing to it you want /CE low but /OE high). For ROMs if there is a difference, it is in speed and power consumption, but not in functionality. So if it's hard to tell whenever pins connected to +5V or GND on a board are unused enalbe pins, it's even harder to determine which ones are /CE or /OE !

<br />In 6264 datasheets I've seen, /WE overrides /OE, so that it'll still work even if you tie /OE to /CE. The datasheets mention supporting both "8080 style buses" that use /RD and /WR and "6502 style buses" that use /CE and R/W.

<br />Yeah, you can't determine it without testing the actual chip. But access time seems part of functionality, so you can't switch /CS and /OE unless the memory is faster than the usual required. My theory is that 20 is connected to GND so that it can be a /CS, or NC, and work. Same for the upper address line pins being connected to +5V, as CS2, CS3 etc. pins, or NC.
<br />
<br />I think it would be good to have a normal ROM pinout compared to the pinouts of the PRG and CHR "sockets" on a board. I believe an EPROM has the same pinout as a ROM when not being used in program mode, so there's little need to even mention PGM, Vpp, etc.
<br />
<br />BTW, I like that you're interested in documenting all the board types and why they are that way, because it sheds light on the reasons they are designed that way, and highlights useful approaches to board design. So clarity beyond merely "this board is that way" is good. It makes it easier to remember, for one, since you understand the logic behind the design, rather than it being arbitrary seeming.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />OK I fixed it. Yeah just doesn't use that solder pad to put the unused A14 to VCC. This means that particular pin didn't HAVE to be on VCC, at least not for this particular run of mask ROMs.
<br />So the whole point of having different NROM-128 and NROM-256 boards makes no sense to me.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I figured I'd join in on this discussion...for documenting board details I would think the best way to do it would be like most schematics I've worked with do.  At the top level you have chips and named signals between the chips (CPU_A15, for example).  Clicking on any chip in the design brings you to that chip's "page" where the chip is the only thing on it.  The board-level signal names surround the chip on the wires going into the chip.  Inside the chip box you have the chip manufacturer's signal names and pin/ball/land number aligned to the same pins as the signal lines they correspond to.  So, if by some esoteric example a board wired CPU_A15 to the PRG ROM's /CE, that would be immediately obvious at the mask ROM level of the schematic.
<br />
<br />You could even have a "footprint compatible" selection which would simply interchange the chip's internal details with those of another one to show what the differences were.
<br />
<br />Just thoughts.
