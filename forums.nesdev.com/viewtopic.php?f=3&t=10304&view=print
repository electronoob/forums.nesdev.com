		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Hey all.<br /><br />My understanding of hardware level details has always been minimal.  I was hoping to use Visual6502 to change that.  So I started reading the &quot;Visual Circuit Tutorial&quot; on the wiki:<br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://wiki.nesdev.com/w/index.php/Visual_circuit_tutorial">http://wiki.nesdev.com/w/index.php/Visu ... t_tutorial</a><!-- m --><br /><br />Coming from zero experience in this field, this tutorial is very confusing because it doesn't explain many fundamental points.  I was hoping someone here could clarify for me.<br /><br />Specifically, the &quot;inverter&quot; example:<br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://wiki.nesdev.com/w/images/8/80/Vis_inverter.png">http://wiki.nesdev.com/w/images/8/80/Vis_inverter.png</a><!-- m --><br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">the wiki wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">When the input gate is low, current flows into the output wire. When the input gate is high, current flows into ground, driving the output wire low. The output wire is hence the inverse of the input wire.<br /><br />When one node is the inverse of another, it is said that it inverts into the other node.</div><br /><br />This is very confusing to me because it doesn't explain why any of that happens the way it does.  So can someone answer a few questions for me?<br /><br />1)  What determines whether or not the input polysilicon is high?<br /><br />2)  How does the input polysilicon here affect the output polysilicon when they don't touch?  I assume the current flows through the other diffusion areas, but how?  What determines which diffusion area receives current and when?<br /><br /><br />Thanks.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />The level I intended at that point was &quot;what&quot; the transistor does (when used as an on/off switch, as is usually the case in digital electronics), not &quot;how&quot; it does it. For what it's worth, I wrote that while I still had a very vague idea of the physics behind transistors (it's slightly better now, but still very basic). I'm a top-down kind of guy, but other people's brains might work differently. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_confused.gif" alt=":?" title="Confused" /><br /><br />I found this video helpful for understanding &quot;how&quot; (NMOS) transistors work: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcrBqCFLHIY">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcrBqCFLHIY</a><!-- m -->. Understanding it at that level is not essential for reading most of the circuitry in the Visual * simulators though.<br /><br />Do you think it would be helpful to move the video to an earlier point in the tutorial? Any other suggestions?<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">Disch wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">1)  What determines whether or not the input polysilicon is high?<br /></div><br /><br />The input polysilicon is high if it is connected to a power source and the current from that power source doesn't go to ground. A more electronicy way of saying that is that the voltage on the gate (input polysilicon) must be pulled to VCC rather than to ground. Here's two trivial (and somewhat pointless) examples:<br /><br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; VCC<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;|<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;|<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;|<br />VCC------&#91;gate&#93;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;(gate is always high (always conducts current), A will be powered/pulled to VCC)<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;|<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;|<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;A<br /><br /><br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; VCC<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;|<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;|<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;|<br />GND------&#91;gate&#93;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;(gate is always low (never conducts current), A will _not_ be powered/pulled to VCC)<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;|<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;|<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;|<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;A<br /></div><br /><br />Whether a gate is high or low could also be influenced by other gates:<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;|<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;|<br />VCC-------+-------&#91;gate B&#93;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; |&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; |<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; |&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; |<br />&nbsp;...---&#91;gate A&#93;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; |<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; |&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; .<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; |&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; .<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;GND&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;.<br /></div><br /><br />In the above case, gate A being high means that gate B will be low (current will to ground instead of to gate B), and vice versa. This is the same situation as for the inverter, if you assume the output in that figure goes to gate B.<br /><br />I hope that helps. Maybe the tutorial could be clearer on what being &quot;high&quot; means for a node.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">Disch wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">2)  How does the input polysilicon here affect the output polysilicon when they don't touch?  I assume the current flows through the other diffusion areas, but how?  What determines which diffusion area receives current and when?<br /></div><br /><br />Not sure if I'm getting the question. If the poly doesn't touch the diffusion, then you won't have a transistor, and no current will ever flow between between. I realize that probably isn't what you mean though, so maybe you can clarify. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />Edit: Shouldn't have said &quot;between them&quot;, as current never flows from the gate to the source/drain. What I meant is that current never flows across &quot;gaps&quot; if areas don't touch at all.<br /><br />The actual structure of transistors is like in the video I posted, so the 2D display is a bit of an abstraction. Whenever you have a polysilicon strip squished between areas of diffusion, you can be pretty sure there's a transistor there though (and you can click on it to see if it gets highlighted if you want to be extra sure).

The voltage on the gate only controls whether or not it lets current through (whether or not it's conductive) - you never get current going from the &quot;source/drain wires&quot; onto the &quot;gate wire&quot; or vice versa.<br /><br />To put it another way, current will never flow from A to B or from C to B (or vice versa) in the figure below:<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; .<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; .<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; .<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; |<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; |<br />B-----&#91;gate&#93;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; |<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; |<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; .<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; .<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; .<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; C<br /></div><br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">Disch wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">It seems to me if the gate is low, the current wouldn't go anywhere and would be trapped at the VCC.</div><br /><br />That's exactly how it works. Think of the gate as an actual gate. When it's high/open, it lets current through (it is conductive). When it's low/closed, it blocks current (not conductive). (I've been discouraged from using the open/closed terminology for gates though, as open/closed have the opposite meaning for switches.)<br /><br />It's a bit of a balancing act to talk about currents instead of voltages though. On the one hand, I find currents easier to think about than voltages, but on the other hand, you often don't have any actual current flowing in the steady state (the state after things have &quot;settled down&quot; after e.g. a clock tick). In the example above where the gate is connected to VCC, the current is &quot;trapped&quot; in the gate and doesn't flow, but the condition for the gate to be high isn't that current flows in it - it's just that the voltage on the gate is at VCC.<br /><br />The way I visualize it is that the gate is high if you have current &quot;pushing into it&quot; (though not flowing, since it doesn't have anywhere to go).<br /><br />Edit: As a side note, one reason NMOS tends to waste more power compared to CMOS is that you often have an (actual) current flowing in the steady state for NMOS. For example, if the input to the inverter is high, then you have a current going from VCC to ground even in the steady state.

Perhaps you could point out the flaws in my understanding?<br /><br />1)  Current originates at VCC<br />2)  current travels from VCC to DIFFUSE (how?  wouldn't it depend on 'X' gate?)<br />3)  if 'N' gate is high, current goes from DIFFUSE to GND, and therefore does not go to X, leaving X low.<br />4)  if 'N' gate is low, current goes from DIFFUSE to X (through that second 'Q' joining?) thereby forcing X high.</div><br /><br />Note that the 'X' gate has a hook in it, which means it's one of the &quot;special&quot; transistors used as resistors on power sources (<!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://wiki.nesdev.com/w/index.php/Visual_circuit_tutorial#Power_sources">http://wiki.nesdev.com/w/index.php/Visu ... er_sources</a><!-- m -->). Ignoring that resistor (which is just there to limit the current that can flow), you get the following diagram:<br /><br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; /-----...(output)<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; |<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; |&nbsp; &nbsp;g<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;VCC----+---a---GND<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; t<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; e<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; |<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; |<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; .<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; .<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;(input)<br /></div><br /><br />To be perfectly honest, I'm not sure exactly how the depletion-mode transistors (the hooked ones on power sources) work, but the only thing that's important to know about them when starting out is that they act as resistors on power sources. The diagram above is how the simulator views the circuit - it doesn't model the depletion-mode transistor as a separate transistor.

Nice to get some feedback to know which parts can be improved. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" />
