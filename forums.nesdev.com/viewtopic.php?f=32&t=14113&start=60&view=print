I'd think we could sticky the rules for the compo, and then sticky finalized entries.<br /><br />Not sure how much work it is to do that but figured I'd see if others thought it was a good idea.

It really is up to your own discretion.  When we put in &quot;not released&quot; it was intended to exclude entries that had already been 100% completed, available to the mass public for distribution, or released on cartridge (not including one-off prototypes or small runs for friends etc).  There hasn't been any rule against submitting something that you have been working on for years.  I have mentioned before that you shouldn't wait for the next compo announcement to start working on your project.  You can pretty much guarantee that there will always be an NROM category.  Also, if there have been significant changes (as decided by judges) there shouldn't be anything holding you back from submitting in the main category.<br /><br />As for the anything goes category, it is pretty self explanatory. Entries can include projects submitted in other contests, projects already released to the public that they would like included on the cartridge, and anything else that wouldn't fit into the NROM category.<br /><br />I think one of the origins of this competition was to encourage people to finish and release their projects. We all have projects that are years in the making and in various states of completion.  This is supposed to give a bit of incentive.<br /><br />Also, feel free to make a build thread, feel free to do what you like.  The only thing that will be judged is the final entry that is submitted. Not everyone has a support system that allows for feedback for their projects and this compo isn't intended to stand in the way of making your project better.
