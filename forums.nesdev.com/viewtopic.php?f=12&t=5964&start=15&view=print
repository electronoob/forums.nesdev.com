		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I've compared the GSU specs with the schematics...<br /><br />GSU-2 can address 128Kbytes SRAM, so there should be SRAM.A16 somewhere (probably on GSU2.Pin106). This could be verified on the SHVC-1CB0N7S-01 board (used by Doom, the game has only 64K installed, but the PCB could be also fitted with 128K, so the SRAM.A16 connection should be there).<br /><br />GSU-1 can probably address only max 64Kbytes SRAM (it looks like so in your schematic); which would imply that the RAM bank register (303Ch - RAMBR) does exist on GSU-2 chips only (it's somewhat located at the end of the I/O map, which is also hinting that it's a later invention). Btw. are there any docs for pre-GSU-2 chips? (for figuring out differences between GSU-2 and older GSU chips)<br /><br />Then there is the 3033h - BRAMR register for protecting &quot;back-up RAM&quot; at 780000h-79FFFFh. The &quot;back-up RAM&quot; would be RAM connected to the SNES bus (not the usual RAM connected to GSU's SRAM-bus). This &quot;back-up&quot; stuff isn't used by any existing cartridges. I am just mentioning the feature because one or more of the NC pins are probably &quot;back-up /CS, or CS, or /RD, or /WR signals&quot;. It may be difficult to find out on which pins that unused feature is hiding (and probably not really worth doing it).<br /><br />On GSU-1, ROM is always enabled (both /CE and /CS wired to GND).<br />And on GSU-2, ROM./CE is GSU.Pin20... that <em>looks</em> as if GSU2.Pin21 might be another ROM./CE signal, for a second ROM chip. With 21bit ROM address bus and two ROM chipselects, it could access 4MByte ROM (which does match up with the GSU specs).<br />And GSU-2, ROM./OE on GSU2.Pin111... I don't understand that part of your schematic... It looks more like a GNDed pin (not like an /OE signal)...?<br /><br />---<br /><br />And, not related to the schematic, there's the 303Bh - VCR version code register. Did anybody ever read that register? Or byuu, can you do that with your hardware setup?<br />There are least 5 different GSU chip versions (MarioChip1, GSU1, GSU1A, GSU2, GSU2-SP1), which may or may not return different version codes in 303Bh.

There is a register where you can switch between these two modes but from what I've heard it doesn't do anything on the MARIO CHIP 1. MotZilla sais GSU-1 works at both 10.5MHz _and_ 21MHz. So it seems like they fixed it at some time between 9321 and 9406. <br /><br />As I haven't heard that anything else differs between MARIO CHIP 1 and GSU-1, the GSU-1A could be either a renamed MARIO CHIP 1 or a prereleased GSU-1?, hard to tell without doing some tests.<br />It looks like they produced both GSU-2 and GSU-2-SP1 in the same timespan which could indicate that the to CPU's might not be fully compatibile (why produce two versions otherwise? needs to be verified)<br /><br />One obvious change is the address bus though<br /><br />So it seems like there where 5 revisions, MARIO CHIP 1 -[renaming (and highspeed mode?)]-&gt; GSU-1A -[highspeed mode(if it wasn't done in GSU-1A)]-&gt; GSU-1 -[increased address bus]-&gt; GSU-2 -[reduced package size (and perhaps something more)]-&gt; GSU-2-SP1

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Hyarion and me are keeping a very interesting conversation about SuperFX by email, maybe we could keep talking about it here.<br /><br />As I told him, I think GSU2 and GSU2-SP1 have some more differences than those related to the package. My guess is:<br /><br /> * Not much sense in starting a new fabrication process to change only the package.<br /> * Yoshi's Island boards use GSU2 and GSU2-SP1 and each of them has a source code revision... I mean, there are at least two ROM versions (3 in Japan) which means 2 different codes; it looks like they were programmed for GSU2 and GSU2-SP1 respectively.<br /> * &quot;SP1&quot; suggests &quot;Service Pack 1&quot; so it could be pointing at some change in the SuperFX microcode. Altough it also could stand for &quot;Small Package&quot; or whatever (but then the number doesn't make sense).<br /><br />AS for GSU-1A, my chip is <a href="http://imageshack.us/a/img853/4453/dsc0399dz.jpg" class="postlink">9404</a>, so if the number tell us the revision, there should be several of them for each SuperFX version. My GSU-1 revision number is <a href="http://img201.imageshack.us/img201/2558/dsc0400w.jpg" class="postlink">9422</a>.<br /><br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">So it seems like there where 5 revisions, MARIO CHIP 1 -[renaming (and highspeed mode?)]-&gt; GSU-1A -[highspeed mode(if it wasn't done in GSU-1A)]-&gt; GSU-1 -[increased address bus]-&gt; GSU-2 -[reduced package size (and perhaps something more)]-&gt; GSU-2-SP1</div><br /><br />I would say 5 versions; this way, the number in the chip would be the revision number.<br />Do you think GSU-1 and GSU-2 differences are only related to package? It doesn't seem a serious concern to build another chip...

Besides, it makes sense to name GSU-1A as a later revision of GSU-1, not as a previous one.

That's strange, but I would tend to trust on the date codes there.<br /><br />Btw. just for curiosity, do you know if there are differences in the pinouts (between the 100pin MC1, GSU1, GSU1A variants, or between the 112pin GSU2, GSU2-SP1 variants)?<br />The GSU2-SP1 does of course have oddly arranged pins (with pin1 being the SECOND pin and so); but I guess that was done to maintain the same pin numbers as for GSU2.
