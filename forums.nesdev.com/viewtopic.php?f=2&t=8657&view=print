		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />So, I'd like to come up with a password system that stores 8-bit values.  It should involve the least writing/inputting by the end user.
<br />
<br />I thought I was onto something with using 99 characters plus 3 "accents" (none, line above letter, line below letter)
<br />
<br />The accents would denominate the hundreds place so:
<br />none = 0
<br />underline = 100
<br />line above = 200
<br />
<br />and the characters 0-99 would represent that numerical value.
<br />
<br />Okay, so I guess that would be 0-299 for each place in the password.  The player could press up-down to select a letter.  Left-right to traverse the place in the password and A button to toggle accent.  With a button press the first place to the left would back out of the password entry screen and the last place to the right would confirm password entry.
<br />
<br />Any better method you can think of?

<br />
<br />Have you considered using 16 symbols and have the user enter 2 symbols for each byte of your password. Basically you'd be using hexadecimal notation, but you could use different symbols than 0-f to make it more passwordish.
<br />
<br />You could even consider dropping down to just 4 symbols and have 4 symbols per byte. They'd have to enter more symbols, but each symbol would be easier to select. Plus you could use shapes or icons instead of alphanumeric characters.

<br />
<br />What I'd do is ensure that maybe every other character is a vowel, and then pick consonants where you wouldn't get lewd passwords (FUKU for instance).
<br />
<br />FKJLEM
<br />
<br />Is probably tougher to remember than something you can pronounce like
<br />
<br />RIKUME
<br />
<br />This might even mean the password ends up longer since there aren't even 16 vowels for what Zack recommended, but they should be easier to just remember. 
<br />
<br />Edit: Also keep in mind, you don't NEED to store a value of exactly 256 in a single character in the password.
<br />
<br />A, E, I, U allows for two bits, so a string of four of those letters gives you a byte. If you choose 16 consonants, then each of those gives you 4 bits.
<br />
<br />Two consonants or a consonant and two vowels gives you a byte, and the player only has 20 characters to choose from. 
<br />
<br />You could even use this system for basic error checking.
<br />
<br />Say A = 00 and B = 0000
<br />
<br />BABA
<br />and
<br />ABAB
<br />and 
<br />ABBA
<br />would obviously all give the same byte stream, but you could check which parts of the password are consonants and vowels as well and reject the password as a "guess".
<br />
<br />Also, some things don't need a whole byte. For instance if you have 8 worlds, but they can't be beaten out of order you only need 3 bits for that.

<br />I like that!  
<br />
<br />What I have heard from lots of Battle Kid players is they just use a cell phone to take a photo of the screen instead of writing or remembering the password.  So having something that is more readable in a fuzzy pict would be more important, and small things like accents could be missed.  Password entry would then be a better thing to optimize than the password itself.
<br />
<br />However having the separate button for accent would cut down on the scrolling through letters.  Having a grid instead of just a line would do the same too.

The alphabet is 32 characters (thus 5 bits per character), the password is 8 characters long, and eight of the 40 bits are used as check digits and should be zero if a password was descrambled correctly.

		<td><b>Case Study: Simon's Quest</b></td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Case study:
<br />
<br />Simon's quest (USA) has a password of length of 16 characters, with a 32-character alphabet.
<br />
<br />The password encodes 16 bits of item on/off flags, 8 bits of item counters, 8 bits of day counter, 2 bits of crystal level, 3 bits of weapon level, 3 bits of player level, 8 bits of crypting specification, and 16 bits of checksum, for a total of 16 bits remaining for redundancy (they must be zero).
<br />In addition, some of those levels / counters have a maximum value, e.g. a weapon level 4 is permitted but weapon level 6 is not.
<br />
<br />The crypting specification has 4 bits of "xor" and 4 bits of "add". The "xor" is an index to a hardcoded table of per-byte xorring constants, and the "add" value is internally created 0..4 and depends entirely on the xorring value (despite larger and independent values supported in decoding). Because 0..31 + 0..4 may produce values in 0..35 range, the alphabet actually has 36 characters. The last 4 characters are synonymous to the first 4. In effect, though there are 256 distinct possible ways to crypt the same password, only 16 are generated by the game.
<br /><img src="http://bisqwit.iki.fi/cv2fin/comparative_screenshots/menu_ntsc1.png" alt="Image" />
<br />
<br />However, when they ported the game to PAL systems (for international English release), they had realized that there is at least a theoretical possibility for accidentally obscene passwords in the game. It was highly theoretical, because I have calculated it and found out that there are actually only about 90 passwords, total, that consist entirely of English words, and most of those cannot even be generated by the game (because of the rigged add-generation). One of them is “PORN VOLT DEAD WHAT”, and you can see another in the screenshot above.
<br />
<br />So they removed all the vowels and some of the most common consonants.
<br /><img src="http://chii/cv2fin/comparative_screenshots/menu_pal1.png" alt="Image" />
<br />
<br />The password generator engine was kept absolutely identical to the NTSC version; only the font was changed. If you enter the password by tactile  &amp; aural feedback only, you can enter the same password just fine in both versions.
<br />Removing the vowels worked perfectly in eliminating any chance for obscene passwords. Well, unless you allow L337 spelling, in which case you might get something like in the above screenshot. Not very obscene, though. (And the game never can generate the above password, though it successfully decodes it.)
<br />
<br />
<br />The large 16-bit checksum in this game works very well in ensuring that one does not easily stumble upon valid passwords by chance. In addition, even if you manage to match the checksum, there are a number of other things that may go wrong: You may have specified an out-of-range value in one of the fields. For example, the player level is encoded in 8 bits in the password, but its limits are 0-6 (and thus checked).
<br />
<br />
<br />Internally, the password encoding &amp; decoding process works like this:
<br />To encode:
<br />1. Poke the game data in 7 bytes of a 10-byte array (each byte 8 bits)
<br />2. Place the checksum in the array (it occupies 2 bytes of those 10). The checksum is simply a sum of preceding bytes.
<br />3. Decide the xor &amp; add values, and place them in the array (it occupies 1 byte of those 10).
<br />4. Convert the password from 8 bits per byte into 5 bits per byte. This means that 80 bits gets stored in 16 bytes.
<br />5. Crypt the first 14 bytes of the password according to the xor&amp;add values.
<br />To decode:
<br />1. Read the last 8 bits of the password (from the last two characters containing 10 bits of data), to determine how the password was crypted.
<br />2. Decrypt the password.
<br />3. Convert the password into 8 bits per byte (length decreases from 16 to 10).
<br />4. Verify checksum.
<br />5. Read the data from the password, and verify that they are within limits.
<br />
<br />Conclusion: Simon's Quest password system was very well designed, compressing the necessary data (which did not feel like a small amount) into concise passwords that could actually be remembered.
<br />It was also extremely cracking resistant.
<br />
<br />It did not however save all of the game's data.
<br />- Heart counter and experience level were zeroed. Justifiable: The same happens on gameover.
<br />- Hours and minutes are reset to 12:00 pm. Minor inconvenience.
<br />- Player's location was reset to the first town. Though the password has enough spare room in it for the player's location (I've tested successfully adding it), there are difficulties in restoring the position exactly. In some places, Simon might spawn in a location with no way out (for example, water-breakable platforms in ceiling, where Simon cannot throw bottles, or cornered by tough enemies). If the password is generated next to the ferryman, Simon is spawned above the lake with no boat under him, instantly drowning him.

<br />
<br /><img src="http://bisqwit.iki.fi/cv2fin/comparative_screenshots/metroid.png" alt="Image" />
<br />Metroid passwords are 24 characters long, with an alphabet of 64 letters, for a total of 144 bits of data.
<br />That 144 bits includes a 8-bit checksum that is calculated from the other bits (as bytes), and 8-bit roll value that rotates the bits of the password around. What remains is 128 bits of payload, which includes the missile counter, the starting land, and numerous flags on doors opened and items taken.
<br />The lowercase letters are shown in a very thin font.
<br />
<br /><img src="http://bisqwit.iki.fi/cv2fin/comparative_screenshots/glegend.png" alt="Image" />
<br />Guardian Legend has the most intimidating password system that I know.
<br />Its passwords are a whopping 32 characters long, with an alphabet of 64 letters, and the alphabets contain accents (umlauts). Admittedly, those accents are only used to make the distinction between capital and lowercase letters clearer (and was probably added only at moment's inspiration to reuse the dakuten feature from the Japanese version), but it's still quite nasty.
<br />Naturally, such a mammoth password password would not have been used, unless it also encoded a ton of data. And it does. The password encodes a total of 192 bits of data, and includes the following:
<br />- 68 bits of progress flags at various locations
<br />- 4 bits of chip level
<br />- 20 bits of corridor flags
<br />- 20 bits of player's score
<br />- 12 times 2 bits indicating status of different weapons / equipment
<br />- 8 bits of ammo
<br />- 8 bits of key acquisition flags
<br />- 3 bits of firing rate, maxes out at 5
<br />- 5 bits of shield amount
<br />- 3 + 3 bits of weapon and shield strengths
<br />- 5 + 5 bits of X and Y coordinates on the game map
<br />For a total of 176 bits. Then comes 8 bits indicating a xorring value to be applied to the password, and 8 bits of a checksum to be applied to the password data, for a total of 192 bits. There are no unused bits in this password system.
<br />
<br />Then there's Battle of Olympus.
<br /><img src="http://bisqwit.iki.fi/cv2fin/comparative_screenshots/olympus.png" alt="Image" />
<br />The password contains an unexpected number of 26 characters, with an alphabet of 64 letters, for a total of 156 bits.
<br />The password entry dialog is very slick and makes even the long passwords easy to input, with fast-reacting autorepeat and wrapping at edges. The password font is very clear, with no problem distinguishing O and 0 or I and l and 1. The numbers are in italic typeface; the capital letters are in a serif typeface and the lowercase letters are neither. It is up to the player's pen to follow similar clear conventions. 
<br />Among other things, the password encodes both the player's name (up to 6 letters) and the heroine's name (up to 6 letters), the two of which together already amount to half of the password's length. 
<br />In my experience back in the day, this password system was extremely cracking-resistant. I don't remember if I ever managed to successfully produce a fake password. Now that I have a generator source code available, it still defies my understanding. Apparently, it has xorring, adding, rolling and checksumming. Most systems have at most three of those.
<br />
<br />Finally, there's Faxanadu, which is different from all of those, in that Faxanadu passwords are variable length:
<br /><img src="http://bisqwit.iki.fi/cv2fin/comparative_screenshots/faxanadu.png" alt="Image" />
<br />You may first notice that it also has a thin (but very clearly readable) font.
<br />The maximum length for the password is 32 characters, and the character set is 64 letters, for a total of 192 bits. But most passwords are considerably shorter than that.
<br />Faxanadu uses a stream based encoding for the passwords.  The password encodes the following:
<br />- 8 bits checksum
<br />- 5 bits of password length
<br />- 3 bits of town
<br />- 4 bits of rank
<br />- 16 bits of key items and quests
<br />- Optional 2-bit weapon, 2-bit armor, 2-bit shield, 2-bit magic and 5-bit item
<br />- Numbered 4-slot weapon listing, each weapon 2 bits; same for armor, shield, magic.
<br />- Numbered 8-slot item listing, each item 5 bits.
<br />With optional encodings, the actual value is prefixed by one bit which tells whether the particular value is included or not. With numbered encodings, the actual listing is prefixed by a 3-bit or 4-bit number telling the number of elements in that list.
