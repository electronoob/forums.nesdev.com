LOUD is the perfect word to describe how it sounds.<br /><br />Apparently due to the fact that the YM2149 has three current sources instead of one (and I am not even sure if the 5B has the same voltage level output as an YM2149 in each of it's pins) the SSG is way louder than it's supposed to be. But it's fair assume that what the 5B has on pins 2 and 3 is an inverter port.<br /><br />Edit - This is the circuit I am using:<br /><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-gp_aeOp2f-8/UQ76o2auMqI/AAAAAAAAGFs/WxtU7RomDlU/s800/nes_ay3-8910_ver3.jpg" alt="Image" /><br /><br /><br />Edit 2 - Resistor value was wrong. Circuit rectified<br />Edit 3 - Circuit makes sound identical as the original cart. Resitive divider with 3k3/4K7 resistor fixes up signal to an agreeable level.<br />Edit 4 - Fix image link

Rane commented how loud the original Gimmick cartridge is and after seeing this circuit running, I can only agree.

You might want to consider using something more suitable for audio amplification like the opamp circuit I pointed out earilier.</div> Using non-hysteretic inverters such as the 74HC04 as an amplifier is a time-honored technique, and already used inside the NES and Famicom's audio path. The amount of gain is a function of the MOSFETs used inside and the resistor closing the feedback loop.

To compare with HC04 vased amplifier you need general silicon transistor and one resistor.

There are 32. If it was an AY with a clock divider there would have been only 16.<br /><br />Also, if they were using an AY, I doubt they would have decided to use a clock divider. It would add yet another new component to the design, and there is nothing to gain by doing it. Actually, I would argue that by using the YM2149F's built-in doubler, they've made the chip a lot worse, musically. It adds a useless sub-bass octave to the squares, while taking away most of the envelope's useful high-frequency range.<br /><br />As far as licensing goes, what makes you sure it was licensed at all? Maybe it was just stolen.
