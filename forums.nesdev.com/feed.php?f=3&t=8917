One example I can think of for iNES mappers sharing the same number and having slightly differing behavior is the "VRC" series of Konami boards. The address lines being fed into the mapper differ almost from game to game. And the only way to know which wiring configuration to use is either hash checking or using a database. And mapper 4 also applies to HKROM (MMC6) since it operates similarly to the MMC3 with added battery buffered SRAM that is inside the mapper package. MMC6 was only ever used in two games if memory serves.<br /><br />iNES doesn't even come close to addressing all the different layouts/boards. NES 2.0 is better, but still lacking.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"><br />That's a good point.  In NESICIDE I drop the 16KB artificial boundary of a "bank" in the file while loading the file into the emulator.  Inside the emulator there's only the concept of 8KB banks for both PRG and CHR.

All of my address decoding is done as near to identical to the hardware as possible. <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /> For a few reasons, first and foremost being that if a mapper can change a ROM layout with a single bit, when that bit gets updated the layout is instantly updated. I don't have to mess around with my "Switch PRG" functions whenever a write is made to a register. It also doesn't degrade performance as much as you'd think, and makes my code look nicer in my opinion!<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=4320">beannaich</a> — Sun May 27, 2012 6:31 pm</p><hr />

TLSROM is always 118. TQROM is always 119. Any other T*ROM is 4. Most of the various S*ROM and T*ROM are for different sizes of PRG and CHR ROM, which need different pinouts, but for the most part, they behave identically.<br /><br />There are only a couple boards that can be wired up for more than one mapper. One of them is UNROM, which is most commonly mapper 2, or mapper 180 if one logic chip is replaced (which one commercial game and one homebrew multicart use). Another is CNROM, which can be wired up as a CHR ROM switch (mapper 3) or as extra enables to perform weak copy protection (mapper 185).<br /><br />Some boards have revision numbers, such as NES-CNROM-02 vs. NES-CNROM-05. These do not affect behavior but instead generally improve some aspect of the board's electrical reliability.<br /><br />Some mapper chips have revisions that do affect behavior. The biggest examples I can think of are MMC1, whose PRG RAM enable (controlling access to 8 KiB of SRAM at $6000-$7FFF) behavior changed over the three revisions, and MMC3, whose IRQ behaves differently at the lowest period value on "old" and "new" chips. The newer NES 2.0 format allows mappers to have subtype codes to distinguish e.g. MMC1 and MMC3 revisions, but nobody has defined a registry of those subtypes.<br /><br />The boards assigned to a particular mapper number may have different amounts of RAM on them. For example, mapper 1 (MMC1) can have no PRG RAM (common), 8 KiB of PRG RAM (also common), two 8 KiB chips (mostly in Koei sims), or one 32 KiB chip (rare, Japan only). Mapper 5 (MMC5) has the same options. How much RAM to emulate can be determined implicitly, by the hash of the PRG ROM, or explicitly, using the NES 2.0 format.<br /><br />For historical reasons, sometimes two mappers are given the same number. BNROM and NINA-001 were both given mapper 34. You can tell them apart because BNROM will have 0 KiB of CHR ROM (it uses CHR RAM instead). A harder one is mapper 4, which covers both MMC3 (T*ROM boards) and MMC6 (HKROM board). MMC6 acts just like a late-model MMC3, but its PRG RAM enable behavior differs. Only two games were ever released with MMC6, so what most emulators do is detect them by their CRC.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=9">tepples</a> — Sun May 27, 2012 5:12 am</p><hr />

I'll try to explain a bit about the mirroring: Mirroring is a consequence of partial decoding of the address lines. Address lines are connections between the cart and the console, which are used to tell the cart the address of the byte the CPU needs to access.<br /><br />In order to make the mapper registers accessible to the program, the cart has to map them to certain addresses. The NES has 15 address lines connected to the cart (A0 through A14), enough to address anyone of 2^15 = 32768 bytes (hence why mapperless carts are limited to 32KB of ROM), but mappers don't have 32768 registers... even the most complex ones have no more than a couple dozen registers, so it would be a waste to watch all 15 address lines because that much precision isn't necessary.<br /><br />So, to save on the number of pins a mapper has, it will often only watch enough address lines to tell apart the registers it has. So it's common to see mappers with one register using all of $8000-$FFFF to access it, mappers with two registers dividing the PRG-ROM space in two, and so on (there's no rule for this though, and some mappers divide the addressing space in pretty crazy ways). The mirroring is just a consequence of ignoring some address lines.<br /><br />For example, if you ignore A0 (the lowest address line), but take all others into consideration, it will not be possible to distinguish between odd and even addresses, because the line that makes that selection is simply not connected to the mapper. For this reason, the mapper will act the same if $8000 or $8001 are accessed. $8002 and $8003 will also appear like the same address to the mapper. By ignoring some address lines, a bunch of addresses will look the same to the mapper, and this is why we often see vast ranges of addresses referencing a single register.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=95">tokumaru</a> — Mon May 21, 2012 2:56 pm</p><hr />

PRG A15 is the signal that carries bit 15 of the address being read or written by the CPU. It distinguishes $0000-$7FFF from $8000-$FFFF. It is not brought out to the cartridge edge connector, unlike the next four signals I'm about to describe.<br /><br />PRG A14 is the signal that carries bit 14 of the address being read or written by the CPU. It distinguishes $0000-$3FFF from $4000-$7FFF, or $8000-$BFFF from $C000-$FFFF.<br /><br />PRG A13 is the signal that carries bit 13 of the address being read or written by the CPU. It distinguishes $0000-$1FFF from $2000-$3FFF, $4000-$5FFF from $6000-$7FFF, $8000-$9FFF from $A000-$BFFF, or $C000-$DFFF from $E000-$FFFF.<br /><br />M2 is the CPU clock signal. It stands for "modified Phi2", where Phi2 is one of the clock phases in the 6502 CPU.<br /><br />PRG /CE (program chip enable), also called /PRGSEL (program select), is a signal to enable the ROM chip. The / means "active low", or that the chip should be enabled when the signal is 0 and disabled when it is 1. It is computed from A15 and M2 by a decoder chip inside the NES Control Deck, and it is low when a ROM should be providing data.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=9">tepples</a> — Mon May 21, 2012 8:39 am</p><hr />

In understand.<br /><br />What do you mean by "PRG /CE, and PRG A14 &amp; A13" - mappers-0.80.txt doesn't mention those expressions?<br /><br />(By whole address space I meant from $8000-$9FFF - sorry)<br /><br />Thanks,<br /><br />Richard<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=5305">rhughes</a> — Mon May 21, 2012 8:32 am</p><hr />

Like your example of the MMC1 reg0 it is mirrored through  $8000 - $9FFF<br /><br />This is done by ONLY looking at PRG /CE, and PRG A14 &amp; A13.  Those are they only address inputs the MMC1 has.  So it doesn't matter what A0-A12 are hence the mirror from $8000-9FFF.<br /><br />Not sure what you mean by "whole memory space" in your question.  Really the answer is specific to a given register on a given mapper.  Generally the mirror is only in the address range of the cartridge.  It'll never mirror with $0000-2000 for example because that would conflict with SRAM.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=4832">infiniteneslives</a> — Mon May 21, 2012 8:06 am</p><hr />

Thank you both for the quick reply!<br /><br />That is wonderfully clear, thanks.<br /><br />So, as was mentioned by HardWareMan, would these values be mirrored throughout that whole memory space?<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=5305">rhughes</a> — Mon May 21, 2012 4:16 am</p><hr />
