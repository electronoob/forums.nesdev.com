<br />I feel the same way about english and portuguese. Often when I'm sketching programming stuff people complain that I do it in english, 'cause I always do. Also, people I work with usually complain that I name variables, functions, etc. in english. I have a really hard time reading computer material in portuguese, it just doesn't make sense. Maybe because I learned it all in english, and when I see what people turned the expressions into it just looks stupid. I always laugh at teachers in college pronouncing words like "procedure" using the rules of portuguese. Plus, this kind of material is usually badly translated, you will always find many errors in translated computer books.

<br />If everyone does everything in english, it makes the life of everyone easier. I like comment and label everythig in english, and this makes less trouble than doing it in french where half of the stuff would still have to be kept in english for "impossible-to-translate" purposes, so better is to keep 100% english.

However it is good to have a "Universal language" as there are so few NESDev fanatics that if we start splitting up by language we will individually miss a lot. The good thing about English is that if you stick to a NES technical problems you can be understood pretty easily even with grammar, spelling and syntax that are far from perfect. Still I can understand someone wanting to use their own language. By the way, are all Chinese written languages the same or do we need Cantonese, Mandarin and Peking Chinese forums?

<br />You know, that's funny you mention that, because that's one of the things I noticed about your posts when I first came here. But yeah, I think that multiple language forums would cause catastrophe, because I think it'd just turn into a discussing-the-language-in-english forum. I've noticed in the FCdev forum, people that post there (including myself) like to talk about the Japanese language itself rather than FCdev stuff. I think it'd just be a mess. And there are few people interested in NESdev that speak french or portuguese, like Bregalad was saying. I think it'd just result in a bunch of people starting new threads asking how to say something, and it'd just be a waste of space. I also think it'd be spammed alot.

<br />I have a suggestion: why not make a single "International" (non-English allowed) forum where people may post in whichever language they choose? Here on-topic responders should reply in the OP's language. Perhaps the forum subtitle should say French/Spanish/Portuguese/Chinese/Japanese welcome in their respective languages. This way should another language come along, it can just be added to the subtitle, and it's clear the language is understood by someone.

<br />Well.. This could use some clarification because both 'yes' or 'no' would be misleading.
<br />
<br />In writing, there are Simplified Chinese characters and Traditional Chinese characters.  In the 1950's or so, mainland China took the existing Chinese characters and developed simplified characters.  Elsewhere, simplified characters weren't adopted, and so they're still using traditional.
<br />
<br />Many Chinese in China can read conversational text written in traditional Chinese (in part because of imported karaoke and movies which are sometimes only subtitled with traditional characters), but aren't entirely fluent with it and have never written it.  They never formally studied it, they can't type it, and they certainly can't write it.  As for people who learned traditional characters.. I think it's a bit harder for them.  In my experience, they can read the general grammatical structure but stumble on a couple words per sentence, which makes it a pretty big hassle for them.  Those who speak Mandarin can become decent at typing simplified characters on a computer within a month or two (once they learn how pronunciation is romanized they can type the pronunciation they're familiar with and then see a limited set of choices that they can guess from), but very few of them have done it.
<br />
<br />Worse yet, you can't just change your browser settings to switch between viewing the two.  There's no one-to-one mapping between them.  Converting between the two is a hard problem comparable to translation.  In short, at best a forum that doesn't use their native characters is a little painful to read and they understand that if they ever posted, they'd be using their own native characters which others may not be able to read.
<br />
<br />As for speech and how it relates to writing.. I'm not sure.  People use traditional characters to write Cantonese, whereas with Mandarin it depends where they grew up.  I've been told that Cantonese writing has some differences due to different vocabulary and such.  I don't know how major the difference is.  Amongst people who write traditional characters, I think Mandarin and Cantonese people probably prefer to use their own forums despite the shared characters, and only just occasionally venture into the other languages' site if they've got a reason.  I could be wrong though.
<br />
<br />Anyway.. If what you're looking for is a single standard, the consensus is that the movement is toward Mandarin + Simplified Chinese.  1billion+ people is a pretty big headstart.  For Chinese, I'd just make a Simplified Chinese forum (or, 'China', as it is now) and leave it at that.

<br />For example, Tokumaru would answer to all posts in portugeese, I'd do posts in French, etc...
<br />
<br />But I think this isn't the goal. The FCDev forum was here because japaneese is where the NES and most NES games have been invented. English has the particularity that everyone speaks it a little, and that is the universal language for computer-related stuff. All other languages doesn't have the particularity that japaneese and english has.

<br />Here's how to find out (just for the main page though, so it's potential forum-users):
<br /><a href="http://www.webstats4u.com/s?tab=1&amp;link=3&amp;id=404475&amp;cou=all" class="postlink">http://www.webstats4u.com/s?tab=1&amp;link=3&amp;id=404475&amp;cou=all</a>
<br />
<br />I think it'd be great to have a lot of different language forums.  It's not to split people up, but to get new people to come around who wouldn't post otherwise.
<br />
<br />I would assume there's people like myself, who have little to no trouble reading posts in another language (using translation software or otherwise) but are uncomfortable writing in other languages.  I think it's OK to reply to any threads in english, as long as you understand the discussion and are willing to follow-up.  A lot of answers will be in 6502 assembly anyways, that's the common language around here.
<br />
<br />One big reason I did never opened a lot of other language sections is kinda cosmetic.. it'd make the main forum index larger (it's now 3 page-down keys on my screen, to see if there's new posts).  And the Japanese-language area went unused for years at a time, everyone was just posting in english.  It gets more responses.
<br />
<br />If there is to be another forum made for more languages, what would be next?  I'd guess Spanish.  I like the international forum idea though.
