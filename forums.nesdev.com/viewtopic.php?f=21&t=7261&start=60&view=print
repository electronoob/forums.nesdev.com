It <em>really</em> looks like it should be color 9 and not color 8. Every single NTSC color generator matrix/formula/whatever I've used, with NES parameters plugged in (including forcing color 8 to be the literal colorburst hue) just <em>does not</em> produce results that look like anything I've ever seen the NES look like, even if I set color 9 to be the colorburst hue, it still doesn't look right unless I shift the hues slightly, which screws up other colors. Moreover, there's things like gamma curves (R, G, and B each have their own independent gamma curves, but you'd never know if you asked anyone because everyone wants you to apply gamma only to the luminance, which doesn't produce the right colors, especially in the darker $0x-$1x range of the palette) to worry about too, and really, it doesn't seem like anyone's legitimately interested in a palette that resembles a physical CRT's color output. Moreover, what's the correct way to deal with out-of-gamut colors (which the NES is fond of producing, especially in the blues)?<br /><br />So this is basically why I completely gave up on this. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" />

The Sharp AN-505BK Twin Famicom looks even more greenish (positive hue shift, about +10°). I've never had a US NES, but all video captures seem to indicate a negative hue shift (about -10°), making on-screen color #8 look less greenish. All this on the same TV. On a different TV, the AN-500B looks just as greenish as the AN-505BK. The reason seems to be that the NES does not properly output a sine wave for the color burst but some sort of <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/viewtopic.php?t=10101" class="postlink">weird filtered triangle wave</a>, which causes further variation across models and television sets. <br /><br />The PAL NES on the other hand has rock-solid (i.e. constantly washed-out) colors across all sets I've seen.<div class="quotetitle">Drag wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">R, G, and B each have their own independent gamma curves, but you'd never know if you asked anyone because everyone wants you to apply gamma only to the luminance</div>There is not a single television standards document that ever calls for R/G/B having different electro-optical transfer characteristics.<div class="quotetitle">Drag wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">especially in the darker $0x-$1x range of the palette</div>Those colors are very much affected by how you assume your emulated TV handles non-standard video levels, in particular, the NES' too-small sync amplitude.

The common practice in digital video editing in the YCbCr (YUV) domain is to gamma-correct only the Y channel. But in RGB, yes you're supposed to gamma correct all three.<br /><br />My guess for the phase error is slew rate. There's definitely a low-pass characteristic in the net output from the PPU. Some designs of amplifier have a &quot;slope overload&quot; characteristic, which produces more phase delay at high amplitudes than at low amplitudes because the overall rate of change in voltage over time has limits. There's a difference between this limit and impedance that depends on voltage: impedance that depends on voltage would affect the lower-frequency luma signal, while slew rate mostly affects chroma. There's a test for this: the chroma component of $08 or $38 has a larger amplitude than colorburst, and the chroma component of $18 or $28 has an even larger amplitude. If there's more phase delay on $18 and $28 than on $08 and $38, you've found your culprit.<br /><br />And since 2006, there's been a standard for how to handle out-of-gamut colors: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XvYCC" class="postlink">xvYCC</a>.

And it doesn't explain why two consoles look different on one TV, but the same on another.<br /><br />I agree however that NTSC is definitely susceptible to the slew rate phenomenon: contrary to what is typically claimed, the famous NTSC phase shift problem is not caused by strange things happening to terrestial signals in the air, but by receiver equipment and especially transmitters having an amplitude-dependent phase shift. The first NTSC transmitters <a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?reload=true&amp;arnumber=4505220" class="postlink">shifted the highest amplitudes 30 degrees further than the lowest amplitudes</a>; adjusting the (amplitude-independent) hue control on the receiver could therefore only result in either bright or dim colors looking correct. Hence the popularity of PAL, whose patent specifically mentions its ability to perfectly correct this &quot;differential phase error&quot;, as it's called.<br /><br />Another question, which tepples might be able to answer: SMPTE-170M states that the peak-to-peak color burst amplitude shall be 40 IRE. The NES outputs about 50 IRE (with 75 ohm load), suggesting that saturation ought to be attenuated by 40/50. However, SMPTE-170M describes the color burst as a sine wave, whereas the NES outputs a square (or triangle?) wave. If the square-wave 3.58 MHz signal is filtered into a sine-wave, its peak-to-peak amplitude would be larger, but by how much?

But the real amplitude depends on how the filter's transfer function looks around 3.58 MHz (fundamental) and 10.74 MHz (third harmonic, which is the first overtone of a square wave). Attenuation of -6 dB per octave, for example, will turn a square wave into a triangle wave, and if the corner isn't well above 4 MHz, it'll reduce the amplitude of the fundamental.<br /><br />Disclaimer: I have more of a digital signal processing background than an analog EE background.<br /><br />Two consoles looking different on one TV but the same on another might be an impedance mismatch. The TV where they look the same might have a lower input load.
