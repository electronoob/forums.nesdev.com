The one for the NES? In this case, that's more like just another game in the series and not really a port of the arcade version.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I definitely agree with Soul Calibur for DC, hands-down better than arcade. I also like Super-C / Contra better than arcade Contra, and NES Double Dragon (all of them) better than arcade Double Dragon (all of them).<br /><br />I also thought Final Fight for SNES was much better than the arcade machine, mainly because of the difficulty tweaks. This may have been a result of the arcade owner being a bastard and having the difficulty dips set all the way up, dunno.<br /><br />I also thought the Atari 2600 version of Asteroids was better than the arcade version, but I think that may have something to do with my tiny infant brain thinking &quot;COLOR BETTER THAN NO COLOR!!!&quot; Either way it's got tight controls and freak-awesome sound.<br /><br />There's a few games that I thought were best in the arcades. For instance, Rygar is my favorite arcade original, and even though it was ported to nearly every contemporary platform they all suck the poo.<br /><br />I also once played what I think is the VS Unisystem version of Super Mario Brothers, and I recall being enthralled with the minor differences in level 1-1. This thread has brought back that vague memory. I'm going to have to check that rom out now <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I find Double Dragon 2 as an arcade game to be an unplayable disaster of slowdown, shitty hit detection / hitboxes and mediocre animations. The FC/NES game, on the other hand, feels very responsive, I can see where everything is, the slowdown isn't there, and the animations are consistent (Just look at the &quot;getting hit and falling over&quot; animation from the arcade VS the FC title). I like the harsh contrast graphic style that was adopted to make do with the reduced color depth.<br />Oh, and the FC sound effects sound good unlike the arcade one where I am fairly sure the sound designer farted into a tape recorder at various speeds to create the sounds.<br /><br /><br />Turtles in Time for SFC I like more not just because of the extra stages and such, but rather because throwing enemies was changed from being random to an actual intended action - in the SFC version, the playe rmust walk over an enemy while it is in its keeled-over state and then press the attack button, optionally holding forward to determine the throw type. The arcade version is just stupid and randomized.
