		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I've read that the Japanese NTSC color saturation is mapped slightly different than US TVs. And that viewing such Japanese specific setup equipment will yield slightly lesser saturation on a US display. But from what I've read, it's not a huge difference. 
<br />
<br /> With that said, wiki states YUV and YIQ use the same transform for RGB into their color space. If that's true, and what I've read about NTSC and NTSC-J, then what's the correct transform multiplication matrix for NTSC-J YUV/YIQ?
<br />
<br /> TmEE: once I get an amp setup for RGB on the PCE, I can check that out on the scope. The composite output uses separate DACs than the RGB output, but from what I've seen on the composite output - the Y channel is extremely sharp (very sharp rise/fall edge transitions). It's possible that there's something different about the RGB DAC outputs.

<br />I completely disagree. How many tiles editors does allow to edit graphics with a NTSC or PAL filter in mind ??
<br />For games released back then as computers were really not powerfull, they did most of their graphics on paper first which didn't have NTSC or PAL filtering. Chances are that they fixed a few things if it turned to look really wrong on their TV (most games are Japanese so most of them have been tested on NTSC first), but other than that they probably didn't "design" graphics with NTSC display in mind.
<br />
<br />For games/demoes released today, we use tile editors without NTSC filter, so our graphics aren't meant to be see "with NTSC filter". Even if we test it with Blarg's filter or on our screen, again we will only change something if it really looks wrong.

<br />Except for the general guideline to use a lot of random dots and thin odd-angle lines in random places to get a bit of additional texture from artifact colors as a pixel hits a different phase of the subcarrier period. Compare all the Genesis games that used 1px vertical stripes (1px there = 8/15 of a subcarrier period) to fool the VDP into making rainbows.

<br />Sunsoft sure were the masters of art and shading.  At one point (late 80s/early 90s) they did in fact use graphics/map layout tools running on Famicoms.  Other companies at the same time (Nintendo, Bandai, Toshiba EMI, others) used Fujitsu/NEC computers equipped with above-average graphics hardware and pixel-editing software. <a href="http://www.chrismcovell.com/secret/FC__1988Q2.html#ryoma" class="postlink">(Link)</a> And of course back in the Kid Icarus days, Nintendo probably used a lot of grid paper and felt-tip pens too.
<br />
<br />Well, anyway, the technology used for making Fami games ran the gamut.

<br />I guess Blaster Master is a good example:
<br />
<br /><img src="http://img811.imageshack.us/img811/8506/blaster2w.png" alt="Image" />
<br />
<br />Look how the same gray can be used for highlighting both green and brown, and it blends well with both. It really looks like light green at the top of the grass. Also, look at the black dithering at the bottom of the grass. Some black pixels actually blend with the green and create dark green pixels, resulting in a perfectly good shadow effect.
<br />
<br />Now look at the unfiltered screen:
<br />
<br /><img src="http://img703.imageshack.us/img703/9459/blaster1.png" alt="Image" />
<br />
<br />The gray and black don't blend nearly as well with the colors they are supposed to shade/highlight, and are very obvious.
<br />
<br />The benefit of using this trick is that you can practically fit 2 color scales in a single palette (a lot of games just use 1 gradient per palette), since black can shadow both colors and gray can highlight them. This increases the apparent amount of colors on screen, since there are more hues.

<br />
<br /> You can see that usage of gray like that in Genesis games too. On PCE, there's a low precision RGB to YUV map built in the video out chip - the conversion is done on a digital level. This adds artifacts in the color rage, for all 512 colors (making it effectively different than the Genesis 9bit palette). The side effect is that there are some gray-ish greens and gray-ish purples that blend better than a straight RGB palette. And there are games on the PC-Engine that benefit directly from this. It would be safe to say they designed the colors for the graphics with this in mind. Similar to the famicom examples.
<br />
<br /> 
<br /> NES is definitely one system that I prefer the NTSC emulation artifact look. That WAS the NES look. Even if you get the colors right, a raw emulation shot just doesn't look right. Like tepples stated, the placement of the pixel to subcarrier line phase offset - really gives the NES a unique look (other than the SNES, I don't know of any other system that employs this three scanline phase shift cycle. PCE is only two scanline cycle at 180 degrees out).
