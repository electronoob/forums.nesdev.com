		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Yea, I think I am going to head down that route. One question, I was just re-reading the NMI/IRQ parts of the nesdev wiki and noticed something I didn't before (perhaps it was updated?).<br /><br />Is NMI/RST also checked on the last cycle of an instruction? Or is it just IRQ? I've been checking all 3 on the last cycle historically cause I figured that they all shared similar logic.<br /><br />Also, I know that you can toggle $2000.7 during the vblank and it will trigger multiple NMIs. (<!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://wiki.nesdev.com/w/index.php/NMI">http://wiki.nesdev.com/w/index.php/NMI</a><!-- m -->).<br /><br />Blargg's test say that there is a 1 instruction latency. Do we know if this really one instruction or is it a 1 cycle delay? I ask because I can't imagine how the hardware would be work to make it always one instruction given that the instructions are variable length.<br /><br />Thoughts?

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Which test claims a one-instruction latency (so I can fix the description if it does)? It's more likely that it describes some cases where there is a latency of one instruction due to it being asserted just after the checking near the end of the previous instruction. Also, the only thing authoritative about the test ROMs is that they pass on a NES; <em>all else</em> are claims that can only be informally tested (the failure descriptions and readme with the tests) and are subject to my own errors.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I believe it's always one because the NMI is asserted sometime after the $2000 write at the end STA, which is after NMI is polled AFAIK, thus the 2A03 doesn't see NMI until it checks during the next instruction's execution. Maybe if you could do the $2000 write before the last cycle of an instruction (INC? one of those double-write ones) it'd occur before the next instruction.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />A limitation of blargg's test roms is that they often only test observed behavior without giving information on the underlying signal levels and timings that cause the behavior. This is of course also a strength since it means that you can be sure that something is broken if your emulator fails a test.<br /><br />Knowing more about the underlying signal levels and timings and having it written up on the wiki would be nice though, to eliminate some of the guesswork. Visual 2C02 and <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://wiki.nesdev.com/w/images/d/d1/Ntsc_timing.png">http://wiki.nesdev.com/w/images/d/d1/Ntsc_timing.png</a><!-- m --> shows you the timing on the PPU side, but there's still trickiness involving how e.g. a CPU read might align itself with a flag setting or clearing. (For this reason I think you ought to think in terms of &quot;a read starting at tick n&quot; instead of &quot;a read at tick n&quot;, since a read is not an atomic operation with the PPU running at 3x the CPU speed.)<br /><br />I'm going to focus on coding for a while, but it'd be great if someone else would pick up. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />I've updated <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://wiki.nesdev.com/w/index.php/PPU_frame_timing">http://wiki.nesdev.com/w/index.php/PPU_frame_timing</a><!-- m --> with the latest information I know of btw.

I try to break the test into many steps so that the one that fails will give more insight, but it's still often pass/fail. Giving detailed information might involve pages of code rather than the really concise ten-line test style I've developed. More recent timing test do tend to take the approach of determining the timing and displaying it, then just checksumming the output, so that you can see a little more of what's going on. If someone had days to devote to writing a single test...<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">If you knew what happens when a read starts n master clock ticks before/after different flags change (i.e., whether the read sees the new value or the old, and what special behavior triggers), I guess that would cover everything you need to know.</div><br />Yes, I'd love for these timing things to be documented in terms of absolute hardware timing. The way it is now, it's entirely circular, only stated in terms of CPU behavior. The things it's timed relative to are <em>also</em> CPU behavior, so you can't pin it down. Only indirectly by looking at relative timings to something else, and how that is timed (perhaps to yet another thing), can you deduce what of the many possible timings will fit all these.

By resetting a few times to get different alignments you could probably nail stuff down to the master clock. A nice thing about this approach is that you're still only testing CPU behavior, which makes it harder to mess up.<br /><br />Results would be stuff like &quot;a read starting at master clock n after &lt;some convenient absolute PPU reference&gt; gives behavior x&quot;. You could then pick some convenient alignment to use in your emulator and infer the timings for it (or emulate them all if you're feeling OCD <img src="./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" />).
