		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I do a fresh install about every 3-6 months, but then again I use a standard install. After installing drivers, openOffice, Firefox, and the Java RE (probably something else I'm missing?) my machine is good to go. All my dev'ing tools are kept on a flash drive or another partition. I guess I fall into the "too lazy to maintain" category.

Also, when you study computer science, all your friends and family seem to think you know everything about computers, and will ask you all kinds of favors, including fixing extremely bogged down PCs...! This is partially where my hate for bogged down PCs comes from, because most people somehow manage to trash their PCs in no time. <br /></div>
<br />
<br />I know what you mean. People assume that since its "easy for you" that you'll want to fix the same problem for them time and time again. Nowadays I let the machine sit at my house for a month or so before working on it to try and deter people.

<br />No, most linux users simply get the lastest precompiled kernel downloaded &amp; installed automatically in the background.

Plus, it was the second Word that I ever used — first was Word '98, but we can't find the key that went with it, even though we have the install disc for it. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" alt=":(" title="Sad" />

<br />Because the timeout is set so long. The OS doesn't know whether the connection is actually unavailable or just really fscking slow.
