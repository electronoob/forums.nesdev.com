<br />
<br />I finished some careful phase measurements and found that I had the phase table backwards on the Wiki page; it goes the other direction. I've corrected that and the demo code (also the double clock rate issue tepples pointed out). To be sure I've got things just right, I ran some color sequences with emphasis bits set on the NES and compared them with the output from the demo code; they match very well. Here is the waveform for colors $0F $11 $24 $37 $0F $03 $19 $2C (four pixels of each) with $2001 set to $6x (low two color tint bits set), the top from the NES and the bottom from the demo code (stretched horizontally to match the time scale of the NES sample):
<br />
<br /><img src="http://www.io.com/~greens/temp/nes_ntsc_vs_emu.png" alt="Image" />
<br />
<br />I think this pretty much confirms that I've got the waveform implemented properly. It makes me happy. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />

The only "arbitrary" numbers should be universal physical constants and the values of components used (resistors in this case). Along these lines, the attenuation caused by the "color tint" bits in $2001 is multiplication by a simple ~0.79 factor <em>in relation to the blanking level</em>; the complexity on the Wiki page is merely due to calculating it in reference to the black level.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">I've got a feeling that after resampling/filtering, you'll end up with the same result as my original algorithm (with the correct levels, of course).</div>
<br />
<br />But what about the "color tint" bits in $2001? They cause the color wave to become non-square (see above picture). How would you account for them in your algorithm?

<br />
<br />EDIT: Here's what I get when I filter the ~41 MHz raw emulated signal into the luma and chroma ranges. The first steps are gray, the second color.
<br />
<br /><img src="http://www.io.com/~greens/temp/nes_raw_luma_chroma.png" alt="Image" />
<br />
<br />The top is the raw signal, the middle the luma, and the bottom the chroma. The blue lines are spaced for NES pixels (each color is repeated four times). I used a Gaussian filter to simplify the bandpass for the chroma; a TV using a Bessel filter would put the chroma glitches around level changes to the right side instead of on both sides.
<br />
<br />Basically a TV then extracts the amplitude and phase of the chroma wave to determine the hue and saturation of a color.

I also see you're using the PAL decoder matrix with the vectors swapped; I guess you did that because you've got the chroma [] array backwards, a leftover from kev's old algorithm. If you change the chroma [] array from 210,180,... to 270,300,330,0,30... and switch the U and V vectors, you'll get proper RGB colors and the "hue" control will operate in the correct direction.

<br />Also, when calculating U and V from sine and cosine, don't scale with with 1.140 and 2.032.
<br />
<br />The PAL palette is the NTSC palette with the hue "locked" at minus 15 degrees (assuming the NTSC decoder matrix). Saturation should still be adjustable.

<br />
<br />My algorithm <strong>is</strong> kev's old algorithm, just with some stuff rearranged to make the YUV-&gt;RGB conversion evident. Supposedly, NTSC uses YIQ and PAL uses YUV, but about half of the documents I've seen claim that NTSC switched from YIQ to YUV but don't say <strong>when</strong> - was it before or after the time of the NES?
<br />
<br />The other major annoyance is that I have yet to find a SINGLE document that states how to convert the Chroma phase/amplitude (Hue/Saturation, or Tint/Color) into I/Q or U/V.

The only difference is that decoding with YUV means you have to add 33 degrees to the hue setting.

<br />userHueSetting could be adjustable from minus 180 to plus 180, although in practice -45 to +45 are enough, with zero being the default/unity/"no change" setting. For PAL, this should be locked to -15. (Yes, the PAL hues are different from the default NTSC hues.)
<br />userSaturationSetting could be adjustable from 0.0 (black/white) to anything you like, realistically you'd have 0.0 to 2.0, with 1.0 being the default/unity/"no change" setting.

<br />The color emphasis bits attenuate based on the phases of $x4, $x8 and $xC, not 2, 6 and A, according to the NTSC Video wiki page, which has been reproduced in my algorithm as well. And no, nothing that the NES ever produces will result in "pure" colors in the RGB models.

<br />I never said that it did. I'm saying that it was presumably designed such that "red emphasis" was intended to produce a hue that resulted in pure red, that "green emphasis" would produce a pure green hue, and that "blue emphasis" would give a pure blue hue - in other words, based on the assumption that red, green, and blue were each exactly 120 degrees apart from each other, which is clearly <strong>not</strong> the case with YIQ and YUV decoding (in which red-&gt;yellow-&gt;green is 137.26 degrees, green-&gt;cyan-&gt;blue is 106.36 degrees, and blue-&gt;magenta-&gt;red is 116.38 degrees).

No, YIQ and YUV are based on that it's exactly 90 degrees from <strong>B-Y</strong> to <strong>R-Y</strong>, not from B to R. Remember that the chroma component is the color <em>difference</em> signal (to the monochrome signal, so that it's compatible to monochrome TV sets). Also, YIQ and YUV are designed to allocate more of the spectrum to green because the human eye is supposedly more sensitive to green.
<br />
<br />Of course, common implementations in consumer TV sets place B-Y and R-Y further than 90 degrees apart; I can give you a couple of matrices derived from actual Sony TV service manuals... <img src="./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" />
