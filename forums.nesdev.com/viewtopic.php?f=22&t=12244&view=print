Wear a sunglass lens over one eye to see it. It was also used in a 1989 Diet Coke commercial and an episode of Doctor Who.

It's the main reason I hated Jim Power on the SNES.  I never had the opportunity to see the Amiga original until many many years after the SNES release, and I still remember my initial reaction: &quot;Holy shit! <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5JHIpbWdKow&amp;t=5m0s" class="postlink">The parallax scrolling makes sense!</a>&quot;<br /><br />Also, and this is for Piko: please make sure Mr. Hülsbeck doesn't give you some kind of soundtrack that's ripped off from either <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xk-kaSEGT0U&amp;t=19m34s" class="postlink">Ys 3</a> (like he did with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8VcKqKMF130" class="postlink">Jim Power</a>) or <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuMr5hfV0" class="postlink">Transformers: The Movie</a> (like he did with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NqAsGDgvPyo" class="postlink">Turrican</a>).  Hopefully he learned his lesson...

There exist only a finite number of distinct melodies, and the number of meaningfully distinct ones is on the order of 105 million (proof available on request).

It does make a significant improvement of the intelligibility of the Jim Power 3D scrolling, but it's still ass (just less ass).

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I didnt know this effect actually had a name. Pulfrich Effect huh. *gets sun glasses tries it out*<br /><br />Okay so I got some sun glasses and covered one eye with it and left the other eye with nothing. I watched some pulfrich effect videos on youtube and watched some SNES Jim Power game play and honestly I don't really see any difference. <br /><br />It makes sense that light will hit your eyes at two different times due to the speed of light changing as it hits the sun glasses lens but again it just didnt really work for me. <br /><br />The problem with gimmicks like this in games is that if you have to have a special item an order to play the game usually over time that item gets lost or destroyed or something and then the game is just played without it. <br /><br />After reading about this effect it says that look different depending on which eye you cover up. Can anyone assure me that the background actually scrolls the correct way if say your right eye or left eye is covered?<br /><br />I'm thinking that if you cover up the correct eye then the background scrolls correctly.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Actually, the second we announced the license with Jim Power I got an email from Huelsback people saying he owns the rights to the music. I asked them for proof, and they said &quot; oh well they were given to him in a phone call&quot;. The IP owner, which has been the original IP owner since Jim Power was born, said he had no recollection of that and if Huelsback wanted the music he could licensed it.<br /><br />By this time, they were pretty cool, even offered all the music in editable format for us to port to NES.<br /><br />Then, they went silent to this day. <br /><br />So all music is going to be kept original, but it is done from ground up on the NES.

It cannot be that big than on the Amiga, of course. But maybe the black trees in the background?!<br />By the way, in the NES-video, Jim throws his arms up while jumping. This looks a bit odd. On The Amiga he just throws his arms up while falling.
