		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />So I just got me a neat little Play Computer Zero plus a few multicarts to have something to play at my vacation house. It also comes with a 9-in-1 internal ROM, though the games are mostly rubbish. Tests with a Rockman 6-in-1 and some genuine Rockman carts have gone good so far, so the console itself seems to work.<br /><br /><img src="http://i.imgur.com/T6cpV7Xl.jpg" alt="Image" /><br /><a href="http://i.imgur.com/2nYO6Dk" class="postlink">Console PCB front</a>, <a href="http://i.imgur.com/fKk5TpK" class="postlink">Console PCB back</a><br /><br />Then I tested a 68-in-1 multicart, which the seller has guaranteed to be functional. But all I get is a garbled screen, with no functionality:<br /><img src="http://i.imgur.com/cBm7yCsl.jpg" alt="Image" /><br /><a href="http://i.imgur.com/ddWmBqL" class="postlink">68 cart</a>, <a href="http://i.imgur.com/DvDvV8g" class="postlink">68 PCB front</a>, <a href="http://i.imgur.com/vGsBGFH" class="postlink">68 PCB back</a><br /><br />At the moment I don't know if the console just doesn't like the 68 cart, or if the cart is really busted (I already tried cleaning the contacts). Tomorrow I will try to see if it works on a genuine Famicom.<br /><br />In the meantime, does anybody have some advice if this issue is fixable?

It works fine on a real Famicom (of course the cart only contains a repeated list of SMB, Tennis, Excitebike, Macross, Dr. Mario and a Columns clone).<br /><br />I also tested a few more original carts on the clone (SMB2, SMB3, Yoshi's Cookie), which all work fine as well. So it's just the combination of clone console with clone cart that doesn't work.

I know it sounds silly, but you can run into all sorts of weird Bus conflicts. And I don't mean JUST the VT02/VT03 &quot;OneBus&quot;.<br /><br />For instance, many recent SNES bootlegs actually do complicated tricks with the bus to prevent copying. Why? Because the pirate outfit doesn't want the competetion copying their game!

But the Rockman 1-6 cart, which itself is a pirate also runs well on the clone.<br /><br />Anyway, I still have another clone cart on the way. I really hope that will run better, since it also has a better list of games.
