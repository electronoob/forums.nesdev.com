		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />This is where I am stuck currently. I know that I want my header to be this (as of now):<br /><br />  .inesmap 4   ; mapper 4 = MMC3<br />  .inesprg 8<br />  .ineschr 1<br />  .inesmir 3<br /><br />...and then I need to know what to put in the following ? parts so my program does the following:<br />1) The main program's code starts at $8000 and is read from $8000 from the beginning<br />2) My .db info is stored starting at $9000<br />3) My DPCM sample &quot;sample.dmc&quot; starts at $C000<br /><br />OK, with this in mind, this is what my program looks like from the very beginning. Please let me know what I should fill in the ?'s with or explicitly what other code needs to be introduced to get this thing going.<br /><br />  .inesmap 4   ; mapper 4 = MMC3<br />  .inesprg 8<br />  .ineschr 1<br />  .inesmir 3<br /><br />  .bank ?                 ; &lt;------------What do I put here?<br />  .org $????             ; &lt;------------What do I put here?<br /><br />(this part between the statements above and below is the main program and starts with the label RESET:)<br /><br />  .bank ?                 ; &lt;------------What do I put here?<br />  .org $????             ; &lt;------------What do I put here?<br /><br />(this part between the statements above and below is where my .db info is located)<br /><br />  .org $FFFA     ;first of the three vectors starts here<br />  .dw NMI        ;when an NMI happens (once per frame if enabled) the processor will jump to the label NMI<br />  .dw RESET      ;when the processor first turns on or is reset, it will jump to the label RESET<br />  .dw 0<br /><br />  .bank ?                 ; &lt;------------What do I put here?<br />  .org $????             ; &lt;------------What do I put here?<br />  .incbin &quot;sample.dmc&quot;<br />  <br />  .bank ?                 ; &lt;------------What do I put here?<br />  .org $0000            ; this is referring to the address in the PPU<br />  .incbin &quot;tiles.chr&quot;   ;includes 8KB graphics file<br /><br />;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;<br /><br />Notice that there is nothing in my code that initializes the MMC3 mapper, which I'm told needs initializing. The previous post mentioned I should do some write (probably right after the iNES header) like this:<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">LDA #6 (controls which NESASM bank is mapped from $8000-$9FFF)<br />STA $8000<br />LDA #0 (the NESASM bank number to switch in)<br />STA $8001</div><br />...which doesn't make sense to me because<br />1) shouldn't it be LDA #$06 or LDA #$60 or something?<br />2) What does the 6 mean?<br /><br />OK from here, what do I put in the ? marks above and what other code do I need to include and where? Sorry for the confusion but I keep experimenting with bank numbers and .org addresses and each time the screen is just grey. The game works just fine when I was using mapper 0 but I'm just trying to convert this project to mapper 4.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />.bank 15 must be .org $E000 and it must contain RESET as well as the vector table (IRQ/NMI/RESET).<br />.bank 14 should be .org $8000 and it's where you will put your main code that will always reside there.<br /><br />To understand what happens at $8000 and $8001, look here: <a href="http://wiki.nesdev.com/w/index.php/MMC3#Bank_select_.28.248000-.249FFE.2C_even.29" class="postlink">MMC3 Bank Select</a><br /><br />The value written to $8000 chooses which memory range you need to swap out, then when you write to $8001 this specifies which bank to place in that range.<br /><br />When the MMC3 starts up, the contents of $8000-DFFF is unknown. Only the fixed bank at $E000-FFFF is known, and it is bank 15. This means the code that runs on startup (i.e. RESET) needs to be placed in bank 15. You can set up the other memory regions in your RESET code, then it will be safe to jump to them.<br /><br />MMC3 has 8 different memory pages that can be banked. 6 are on the PPU (CHR), and 2 are on the CPU (PRG). There's an additional mode select whether you want to be able to swap banks in either $8000-9FFF, or $C000-DFFF. Since you need to swap DPCM, you need the latter mode. To select this mode, make sure you have bit 6 set whenever you write a byte to $8000 (i.e. the upper nibble should be $4 or $C). Here is some example code to assign banks to the PRG pages:<br /><br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">lda #$47<br />sta $8000 ; fix $8000-9FFF to bank 14, and chose page 7 ($A000-BFFF)<br />lda #5<br />sta $8001 ; set page 7 to use bank 5<br />lda #$46<br />sta $8000 ; fix $8000-9FFF to bank 14, and choose page 6 ($C000-DFFF)<br />lda #3<br />sta $8001 ; set page 6 to use bank 3</div>

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />OK I have made progress from your help. The game is running again.

I am fine with my code being in $E000 for now just to get it working)<br /><br />  .bank 14<br />  .org $8000<br /><br />(This part has my .db info)<br /><br />  .bank 15<br />  .org $FFFA     ;first of the three vectors starts here<br />  .dw NMI        ;when an NMI happens (once per frame if enabled) the processor will jump to the label NMI<br />  .dw RESET      ;when the processor first turns on or is reset, it will jump to the label RESET<br />  .dw 0          ;external interrupt IRQ is not used in this tutorial<br /><br />  .bank 0<br />  .incbin &quot;sample.dmc&quot;<br />  <br />  .bank 16<br />  .org $0000<br />  .incbin &quot;tiles.chr&quot;   ;includes 8KB graphics file<br /><br />As far as I see, this will be able to hold me until I complete the music part of the program by creating a music engine to play my song with the appropriate DPCM samples at the right times.<br /><br />Here are a few questions involving my .incbin &quot;tiles.chr&quot; used for the PPU:<br />1) The file is exactly 8192 bytes as expected. Later on I will need to do some CHR ROM bank switching. How do I save portions of this file to certain banks... say for example, the first 2048 bytes of &quot;tiles.chr&quot; are in bank 16 and the second 2048 bytes are in bank 17 and the last 4096 bytes are in bank 18 or something like that. Can that be done?<br /><br />Thanks for all the help! I'm getting excited that my project is coming along nicely and I've learned some valuable info involving mappers and bank switching. I couldn't have done it without the patience and input from everyone here.
