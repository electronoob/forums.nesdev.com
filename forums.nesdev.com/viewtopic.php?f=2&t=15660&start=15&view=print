		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />To be clear, I think the previous suggestions are most likely. I just think the bad dump scenario shouldn't be overlooked, as it's possible for e.g. badly written DOS dumping drivers from 1997 to copy random chunks of memory to the output. <br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">tepples wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">One thing that I think could help is a CDL from a complete playthrough.</div><br /><br />I was curious and did end up doing this. It's probably RAM contents. Norton probably runs as a TSR and it got swept up in the dump.<br /><br />It looks like it got two separate pieces of Norton. One chunk is this &quot;NDOS&quot; utility which the Internet says is a Symantec-licensed fork of 4DOS. It's a tool for a fancier command line. The other is Norton Cache, a disk accelerator.<br /><br />There's actually more Norton in the first 32KB and it gets cut off exactly at the 0x8000 mark. There's a lot of empty space and only ~4KB of code. Most of the time the game doesn't read data anywhere near Norton, but 0x7C80 it reads a stray byte dangerously close to the text &quot;SET UNINSTALL SAVE DUMP&quot;.<br /><br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">Omit option EXP or upgrade your Expanded$s01Memory Manager..Norton Cache canno</div><br /><br />The data could have gotten there from a graphics utility, maybe even one Obernolte wrote himself. Maybe it saved in ROM-friendly format by just dumping a whole 16KB/32KB chunk of RAM to disk.<br /><br />Definitely doesn't look like a bad dump though since the game code reads close to it at one point, in the same bank. You guys were right <img src="./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" />

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />The data format used by Color A Dinosaur is really quite simple:<br /><br />* 16 KiB pages 0-4 (but not 5,6, or 7) start with a bus conflict prevention table<br />* Each dinosaur is stored as:<br />** a 32×30 uncompressed nametable without an attribute table<br />** One byte for the number of pattern table tiles in this dinosaur<br />** That number of uncompressed 1bpp 8x8 tiles (i.e. 8× that number of bytes)<br />** A zero byte (not clear why)<br />** Some number of X,Y coordinates ... upper left corner of each region's bounding box? maybe?<br />** Two bytes<br />** Lower right corner X,Y coordinates maybe?<br />** Two bytes<br /><br /><br />Pages 0-2 each contain five coloring sheets. Page 3 contains one. Page 4 contains the copyright screen. Pages 5 and 6 are completely empty.<br /><br />The entire code is only about 6 KiB, starting at the beginning ($C000) of the fixed bank. Everything else is padding or data. (Most of the ROM is padding; there's less than 64 KiB of actual contents here)<br /><br />The fixed bank (7) contains two more coloring sheets—the title screen and selector screen—that mayn't be filled out.<br /><br />It looks like it would be really quite easy to replace the graphics data. The only real restriction is that whatever's there has to fit in 255 tiles.
