		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />So, for the last few years, the main policy on NESdev was to focus all effort to the Wiki, which is easier to maintain (probably because the users just do all the work, the admins/mods just have to remove spams or reverse bad edits), and to leave the deprecated <a href="http://www.nesdev.com" class="postlink">NESdev main page</a> as is, leaving just a big announce that the page is deprecated and redirect to the wiki.<br /><br />There is also a <a href="http://wiki.nesdev.com/w/index.php/Nesdev" class="postlink">Wikified main page</a> which is basically the worst of the both worlds : It does not have the charm/style of the original NESdev main page, it is not actively maintained, it lies in a place it does not belong to, and since there was some random edits, NESdev administrators don't have full control over the page. Most of the bad links were removed, though.<br /><br />I am a mere user so it's not up to me to do important decisions when it comes to how the NESdev website is layed out. But my personal opinion is that the current situation is ridiculous. Info is present multiple times in similar format, which is just terrible. I will also mention the fact that Disch' notes are copy/pasted in the wiki, which is a horrible idea. There is multiple directoins that could be taken in order to make the site organized again, and I don't care either way, but it sounds like doing a major reshaping on how NESdev is layed out is necessary. Personally I'd rise the following points :<br /><br /><ul><li>I personally love the NESdev main page, how it looks (dark background) and how it was layed out. I learned everything with that page, and thus it hurts to see it in a so abandoned state.</li><li>Having multiple sources of information is actually <strong>GOOD</strong>. I am NOT advocating the &quot;let's put everything on the Wiki and let's shut down everything else&quot; fad that has been prevailant in NESdev recently. There is also huge advantages that there is documents written by single individuals that wanted to give their own version of everything, and those documents should remain accessible and unaltered (even if they contains inaccuracies). It is good that mappers are documented several times in NESdev main pages, one time on the Wiki and one time in Dish's notes, separately. The information is presented using different layouts/wording/diagrams and some people could like one better than another.</li><li>However, having the same information copy/pasted elsewhere and then modified to a different version with no clue what's going on is <strong>TERRIBLY BAD</strong>. I am targeting the duplicate of Dish's notes and NESDev main page here, as well as the mappers which have multiple pages on the Wiki.</li><li>The main page of any site (when you just type <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.website.com">http://www.website.com</a><!-- m -->) <strong>should not be a deprecated page, period.</strong> If deprecated pages should be available, it should be in a sub-folder where it is clearly stated as so.</li><li>If the NESDev main page should be wikified, then typing <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.nesdev.com">http://www.nesdev.com</a><!-- m --> should go to the wikified main page, and it'd be good if the fonts/layout could be truthful to the original NESDev main page (although not obligatory)</li><li>There should in NO CASE be multiple &quot;main pages&quot; for the wiki. What I mean is that, if the NESDev main page were to remain within the Wiki, then there should be no <a href="http://wiki.nesdev.com/w/index.php/Nesdev_Wiki" class="postlink">two separate</a> <a href="http://wiki.nesdev.com/w/index.php/Nesdev" class="postlink">main pages</a>.</li></ul>

That, also, would require active maintenance, though.<br /><br />I won't comment on the mapper issue. I don't see a huge problem there.

As such, the root page might as well just be a simple splash page with prominent links to those things. I'd probably make it look something like this:<br /><br />Logo, possibly a brief paragraph describing the site's purpose<br />Link to Forums<br />Link to Wiki<br />Smaller link to archived version of old main page<br />Footer with host information<br /><br /><br />As for the Disch notes, they were kind of carpet bombed onto the Wiki in an attempt to improve its mapper content (which was very lacking for a long time, and still has many gaps). The intent was that their information be merged into the appropriate article, and then the Disch notes should be deleted. The redundancy is a temporary problem, and one that's simple to fix.

If for some reason the way the wiki sets things up is less clear for a particular individual, it's good to be able to fall back to the old documents. After all, the old documents are how I learned nesdev, long before the wiki was created.<br /><br />For Dish's notes, I understand they were supposed to be temporary but they're here from years now. I have absolutely nothing against then, don't get me wrong. But I think they should be maintained separated form the wiki, available for download whoever Dish wants them to be (they are on RHDN for instance, but having them host on NESDEV is not a stupid idea either).

They should be folded into the articles, and not presented redundantly the way they are.<br /><br />Documents that were used as reference, or may provide clarification, should be linked as references in the relevant articles. I try to provide citations like this when I edit the wiki, but I recommend that you add reference links to articles where you see they are lacking. Linking to the disch notes would be nice if we could do it, but unfortunately I think the only coherent form is a ZIP file on RHDN at the moment?<br /><br />Where information is out of date or incorrect, it absolutely <em>should not</em> appear on the wiki, unless as a cautionary note about legacy incorrect implementations. Citations of old articles that have known deficiencies should probably have an appropriate note attached too.

It is a huge pile of mess with multiple pages of info about the same thing, or info about different things merged, and any try to change anything is systematically rejected by others, so it's condemned to always remain the big pile of disorganized junk it grew to be.<br /><br />This is not the fault of anyone and I'm not accusing anybody to behave badly or to have done anything wrong with the wiki. Actually all of us worked really hard to do our best. The problem is that we do it in different ways, and have different tastes and opinions. As long as there is nobody that is devoted to take the &quot;final&quot; decisions as a &quot;chief&quot; and says &quot;the wiki will be organized this way&quot;, it is doomed to remain a pile of garbage like it actually is. So from now on I'll officially say the wiki is a terrible/unreliable source of info and won't look up anything there anymore, and I recommand everyone from not doing so any longer.<br /><br />The technical-complexity over result ratio is really not worth it.

As for the decsions you take, I don't care anymore I've taken mine <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /> for the next 6 months at least. After that we'll see.<br /><br />The problem with mappers is that there's so many of them than if you want to change the layout of mapper page you have to repeat the same work 100 times which is not acceptable. Also it's ambiguous what even a mapper is : Hardware on cartige? an iNES number? or a software coprocessor that handles the bankswitching? it's actually all 3 at the same time. This gives me headaches.<br /><br />Actually the problem is that Banshaku was this chef at the start be I guess he grow tired of this and isn't active anymore.

Articles don't have to be 1:1 with mapper numbers (though we should have a redirect for every iNES mapper, if they don't have a dedicated page), I think it often makes more sense to discuss several related mappers on one page.<br /><br />Try to keep a consistent set of information at/near the top of the page (currently the &quot;Overview&quot; section), with prominent links to related mappers if strongly relevant. If a page becomes too complex, consider building a summary or convenient table near the top to simplify getting to the information you need (or otherwise attempt to re-organize).
