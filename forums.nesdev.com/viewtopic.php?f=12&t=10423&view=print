		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />The MAXI-IJ0N-20 (that's a zero in IJ0N, not the letter &quot;O&quot; like you used) is probably just some kind of &quot;special spin-off&quot; of the official PCB called <a href="http://www.snescentral.com/pcbboards.php?chip=SHVC-1J0N-10" class="postlink">SHVC-1J0N</a>.  I mention &quot;special spin-off&quot; because the <a href="http://www.snescentral.com/pcbboards.php?chip=MAXI-1A0N-30-2" class="postlink">MAXI-xxxx boards</a> are labelled such on snescentral.<br /><br />Either way, the mode 21 memory map is the same:<br /><br /><!-- l --><a class="postlink-local" href="http://forums.nesdev.com/download/file.php?id=732&amp;mode=view">download/file.php?id=732&amp;mode=view</a><!-- l --><br /><br />Mode 21 supports up to 32mbit (4,194,304 bytes) worth of addressing space, located linearly within banks $c0-ff (64 banks).  Math: 64 * 65536 (available bytes per bank) = 4,194,304 bytes.<br /><br />The upper half (i.e. $8000-ffff) of banks $c0-ff is also mirrored within the same address region ($8000-ffff) in banks $00-3f and $80-bf; the mirroring is mainly used for the 65816 vectors (ABORT/COP/BRK/IRQ/NMI) in bank $00, and for fastrom (banks $80-ff).  So to be clear:<br /><br />Byte at $c0:8000 is mirrored at $00:8000 and $80:8000<br />Byte at $c1:8000 is mirrored at $01:8000 and $81:8000<br />...<br />Byte at $ff:8000 is mirrored at $3f:8000 and $bf:8000.<br /><br />If there's something special with the MAXI-xxxx boards, there's one guy here who can shed some light on it: byuu!  And I say that because <a href="http://www.zapatabase.com/documentation/SFC_Dumping_Log.htm" class="postlink">he's dumped one of these carts before</a> (specifically WWF WrestleMania - The Arcade Game for NTSC, a.k.a. SNS-AWVE-0).  There are a handful of carts which are MAXI-1J0N-based though.<br /><br />Also, just want to point this out (not being critical but this can often confuse people).  Quoting with relevant bits highlighted:<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">MAXI-1JON-20 (Mortal Kombat III) [HIGHROM or MODE 21] [ROM <tt style="margin-left: 2px; margin-right: 2px; padding:3px; background-color: #3355aa; color: white;">32 Mbit</tt> only]<br />...<br />but I does not understand, because in that location rom only supports addressing <tt style="margin-left: 2px; margin-right: 2px; padding:3px; background-color: #3355aa; color: white;">32 Mbytes</tt> (can be used only from 8000 - FFFF)</div><br />32mbits != 32mbytes.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Banks $80-$BF can be used for fast ROM, but as with $00 through $3F, the bottom half of these banks is reserved for other purposes. You can map up to 48 Mbit into the fast ROM area: 16 Mbit into the top half of banks $80-$BF and 32 Mbit into the entirety of banks $C0-$FF. This, plus the 47 Mbit in the slow ROM area (banks $00-$7D), makes a total of 95 Mbit of ROM that can be accessed without bank switching.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />snes a22 is generally never connected to the roms, and only connected to he address decoder.  This is because its used to determine if the snes is accessing hi or lo rom space.  Connecting a22 to a high rom chip would be worthless since it would always be hi or lo based on the mode.  Sounds like the pcb was laid out for 64Mbit roms, and inherently supports soldering on a 32Mbit chip as well.  This is a routine choice in pcb/circuit design, most boards do this since the part pinouts are designed to support?

As you found building your Hi/LoROM carts, supporting larger ROMs is usually just a matter of connecting that extra address line, so why not?  It takes just a little work up front, and saves time and money on re-tooling down the road (and back then, factory re-tooling probably would have been more expensive that it is now), since most memory chip families share a common pinout and just disconnect the high address lines as the sizes go down.  These are standards usually handled by JEDEC, but the SNES ROMs at least I don't think follow a JEDEC pinout (but they are standardized among themselves, so that's all that really matters).  They do use standard SRAM, which does use a JEDEC pinout.  So yes, it's not unusual that the ROM A22 pin may have been connected on the PCB even if it was never used (though, as said above, it's connected to the cart edge A23, not A22, due to the mapping).
