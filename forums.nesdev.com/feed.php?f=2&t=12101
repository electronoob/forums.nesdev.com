The real problem is that sprites can have transparent parts, and ensuring they don't overwrite the walls is the biggest performance issue (you can't just plot pixels like you do with walls). You need to check for transparent pixels, then read back from the already rendered map and override the pixels that are not transparent, then write back. <em>This</em> is where most of the time will go.<br /></div><br />That's why I'm placing my bets on sprites for drawing objects. Blending walls with objects would be a nightmare. With sprites, transparency is free, and the only clipping necessary will consist in comparing the object distance to the distances of each wall stripe it overlaps, in order to decide whether to draw the sprites over that strip at all.<br /><br />I was considering designing sprites similar to the ones found in <a href="http://8bitcity.blogspot.com.br/search/label/rpg%20sprites" class="postlink">this page</a>, very low resolution and using very few colors (<a href="http://8bitcity.blogspot.com.br/2011/01/pixel-art-rpg-sprites.html" class="postlink">these</a> specifically appear to fit my requirements, but there are many other good examples). To draw them I would probably store as many 1bpp patterns as possible in the pattern tables, repeated 3 times (each using one of the non-transparent color indices), while also counting on flipping to reduce the tile count. I have to do the math in order to see how many pixels I could cram in each tile (or 2 tiles, if I use 8x16 sprites), but having 9 colors to draw objects should compensate the monochrome feel of the level a bit.<br /><br />The important thing when using sprites is to make sure the player can't get to close to wide objects, because I can only cover about 28% of the viewport with sprites.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=95">tokumaru</a> — Mon Dec 08, 2014 8:52 am</p><hr />
