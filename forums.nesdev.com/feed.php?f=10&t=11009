<div class="quotetitle">tokumaru wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"><br /><div class="quotetitle">Pokun wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">I had a simple delay routine made out of nested loops which delays for about half a second<br /></div><br />That's not how delays should be implemented, regardless of whether this loop is inside the NMI handler or not.<br /><br />The thing is you shouldn't stop everything to concentrate on a single task. A game is a collection of smaller systems that run in parallel, like the game engine, the music engine, and so on. If you have one of these subsystems hog the CPU with a task that's supposed span several frames, all other subsystems will stop, and that will cause important things like timers, music or raster effects to completely stop working during this time.<br /><br />Games must do everything step by step. Every frame, each subsystem gets a chance to update itself, and they should only advance the equivalent of one frame before releasing the CPU for the other subsystems that also need updating every frame. A subsystem can choose not to update itself, but it should never interfere with the other ones.<br /><br />The correct way to implement delays is to use counters, and perform certain tasks (the ones you want to delay) only when the counter is 0. For example:<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">IF COUNTER IS 0:<br />   UPDATE GAME OBJECTS;<br />ELSE<br />   DECREMENT COUNTER;<br />END IF</div><br />This will pause only the updating of game objects, until the counter reaches 0. So, if you want to pause the objects for 2 seconds, just set the counter to 120. But everything else that needs to run will keep running, you won't be pausing your whole program just so that objects won't move.<br /></div><br />Oh thank you for that. My simple delay routine works ok for Pong but if I would add music or something to it, it would stop everytime my delay is executed.<br /><br />My point was that if you have logic code in the NMI and that code is too long for the NMI, it will never finish before the next NMI starts as Tokumaru said. But for a game with simple logic like this it probably won't matter if you put it in NMI or in the main loop.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">chowder wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"><br />this forum seems targeted to more advanced topics, and people who actually know what they're doing <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" /><br /></div><br />Yeah but you can learn tons of stuff by just browsing around this forum or by searching for things you are wondering about.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=6013">Pokun</a> — Fri Feb 14, 2014 6:52 am</p><hr />

I've separated all of the game logic and only handle drawing/PPU updates in the NMI routine now.  I'm aiming for a very simple Space Invaders clone.  The code is attached if anyone feels like commenting.  I don't like how everything's in one source file at the moment, and I need to work on some way of controlling game states.<br /><br />Thanks.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=6395">chowder</a> — Thu Feb 13, 2014 5:15 pm</p><hr />

I didn't bother with buffers though.<br /><br />If you are doing the logic-in-main approach, just make sure you have all the graphic updating code in the NMI and the controller reading (and other logic if any) in the main loop.<br /><br />And whenever you change something, make sure you change as few things as possible between testing. If you change too much it's impossible to know what change it is that breaks your program.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=6013">Pokun</a> — Thu Feb 13, 2014 6:22 am</p><hr />

Hello NesDev, thank you for the wiki and all of the information you guys have provided, it's been a great help <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />I've been through Nerdy Nights and the NES-101 tutorials, and have grasped the basics, but then I read the frame and NMI section on the wiki: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://wiki.nesdev.com/w/index.php/The_frame_and_NMIs">http://wiki.nesdev.com/w/index.php/The_frame_and_NMIs</a><!-- m --><br /><br />That seemed to make sense, so I dropped the &quot;all in NMI&quot; code that I was messing about with in the interests of &quot;doing things properly&quot;.  I'm now thinking maybe I have bitten off more than I can chew in these early days, and should have perhaps stuck with the previous approach, at least until I have a basic one screen game under my belt...<br /><br />I've attached the code (asm6 syntax), what I'm trying to do is output a single line row of nametable tiles (no attributes) and a single metasprite (16x8).  Nothing seems to happen...  I had similar code working using the all-in-NMI approach.  I think my implementation of the buffering technique mentioned in the wiki article is just broken.  I set the data for the buffer as a test, normally I guess this would be generated on the fly.<br /><br />The format for the buffer is stolen from the wiki: number of bytes, high target address, low target address, bytes to write, terminates if length = $00.<br /><br />Thanks for any help, and if you think I'm overstretching myself, just let me know <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=6395">chowder</a> — Thu Feb 13, 2014 12:54 am</p><hr />
