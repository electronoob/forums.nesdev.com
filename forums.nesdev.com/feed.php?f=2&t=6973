If each pattern is not gonna be used more than 128 times, you can use bit 7 to distinguish between used an unused, and the lower 7 bits would be either the number of times it was used (minus 1 to fit the 0 to 127 range) or the index of the next unused pattern. Then all you need is an extra variable to indicate the first unused pattern.<br /><br />So, when you need to use a new pattern, just grab the index from that variable, go to that pattern and grab the index of the next unused pattern and overwrite the variable with that so it becomes the first unused pattern, and then indicate that the current slot is not unused anymore by using its flag and reset the usage count.<br /><br />When you decrement the usage count and detect that the pattern is not being used anymore you can just add it to the beginning of the list of free patterns by linking to it with the variable I mentioned before and making it link to the pattern that the variable was linking to previously.<br /><br />This will give you quick access to the slots since you will not have to waste time searching for anything.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=95">tokumaru</a> — Sat Sep 25, 2010 9:39 pm</p><hr />

Yeah, some kind of compression scheme that was block-oriented, with good performance for gradual decompression going forwards. So for editing, you decompress one block and edit it uncompressed. I actually used something almost exactly like this in QuickNES for storing a movie of the entire game. When a new block is accessed, it decompresses before giving you the pointer. Then if you access it again, it sees it's already decompressed. So the question is whether there is a lot of seeking.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=17">blargg</a> — Fri Sep 24, 2010 4:07 pm</p><hr />

What I had envisioned doing (I never worked on any editor for it) for optimizations during pattern editing was to keep it unoptimized during editing, but when you play it or before you switch to edit a different pattern, it compresses it (re-using repeated data from other patterns, if possible).  When saving the entire file, then it would iterate through each pattern to re-optimize, because more repeated data could have emerged.  I guess this works out sort of like LZ77 in the end result, a sliding window buffer, if I understand the term correctly.  Seems convoluted but maybe the music data would be pretty compact, and able to reference the unpacked data if it's in the buffer.  I don't know if that's much help, though, being just a general idea.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=10">Memblers</a> — Fri Sep 24, 2010 3:47 pm</p><hr />
