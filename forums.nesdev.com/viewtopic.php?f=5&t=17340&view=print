Is anyone else planning on going to Retrospelsmässan in Göteborg (Gothenburg) this year?<br /><br />I'm going with a friend, to stay at his brother's place over the entire weekend. I loved it there last year, so I'm really looking forward to coming back this year.

I've considered taking leave a couple of years, but this year is probably not going to be it. Some friends will surely be there. <br /><br />Once project blue is finished, the deal might be different. So maybe next year...

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Yeah the information is pretty sparse this year, even in Swedish.<br /><br />Like how do the concerts work? Are they just using the same venue? Will be a challenge considering how overcrowded the place was last year. And what about the contests? Judging by the shoddy performance last year, I'd wager I have a pretty good stab at the SMB speedrun competition, but there's no information about which version of the game is being played.<br /><br />You also have to really dig just to find ticket information... seems you just buy entrance at the venue this time, so I'm expecting to end up spending a few hours in that line <img src="./images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" alt=":(" title="Sad" />

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Yup, they say all tickets are bought on site. Only way around that is if you're an exhibitor, press, or volunteer. They also state they have addressed queuing time problems with a new system. It's unclear but it seems to me they mean they came up with a new system on the go last year to help resolve a queuing crisis which they intend to use all-out this year. I'm not sure as everything is kind of vagueposted. :O <br /><br />The site seems a bit rushed, but at least they tend to be good with advertising in the physical world.

Not that it mattered to me, as I helped manage a booth there and had a free pass.<br /><br />Unless they are planning to have a shitton of people manning the entrance to let in lots of people simultaneously, I don't see any way they could make it fast. There will always be a lot of people who are super slow when it comes to handling payments.<br />.... So I'm hoping that's what they'll do. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />

Sure, they keep a lot of their audience updated that way, but if they want to reach out further, i think it'd make sense to at least keep an international counterpart, since they claim (maybe rightly so) to be scandinavias' largest retro games expo. That in itself ought to attract people from all locales with good communications if they had a chance at knowing enough details about it.

I have a Twitter account myself, but I have absolutely no idea how to use it right (I post an update around once a month, I don't think that's the intended dosage). If they post all relevant information there that seems really unintuitive to me, as opposed to using their website or at least their Facebook event which makes it possible to gather relevant information as opposed to spreading it out over random announcements that only reach people in the same moment.

They really went out of their way to improve the experience, and the live symphonic orchestra was an incredible addition (the other concerts not so much). An extra venue (bordering the existing one, separated only by chilling areas and food stands) was added for pinball setups, speedrunners and indie developers, which helped alleviate the crowds and make the place much more nice to hang out, even though there were 4000 participants.<br /><br />I also won the Tetris competition. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />

Makes me eager to maybe have different priorities next year (such a bummer that this expo and another event i'm working on is happening on the same weekend every year!)<br /><br />The location is pretty optimal, there's a public outdoor bath just a stones' throw away. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />
