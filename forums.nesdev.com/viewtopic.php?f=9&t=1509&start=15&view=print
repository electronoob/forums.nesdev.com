<br />Hi! I'm trying to build this ZWS emprom Reader/Burner, but I have some doubts. Maybe you can help me:
<br />
<br />1 - In the original project (<!-- w --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.zws.com">www.zws.com</a><!-- w -->), pin32 of the EPROM socket goes connected to nothing. Do you connect it to Vcc?
<br />
<br />2 - does the trimpot regulates LM317 voltage only?
<br />
<br />This is the only doubts about the circuit, since I made a board schematic and the device is already constructed.
<br />
<br />Thanx! <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />

<br />Hi, Lloyd Gordon! Thank you very much for your support. I've tried to contact zws and Mike Gordon (from the 27C801 mod) without success.  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_cry.gif" alt=":cry:" title="Crying or Very sad" /> 
<br />
<br />1 - Just like I was thinking: the trimpot regulates only the LM317. But... I used a 12Vcc plugpack and my voltage measures stands for:
<br />
<br />a ) 5Vcc in each 4040 (normal)
<br />
<br />b ) no voltage at EPROM socket (because in the original ZWS project there's no connection for pin32, different from Mike Gordon Project).
<br />
<br />c ) - The trimpot <strong>isn't</strong> changing the LM317 voltage, although the voltage at DB25 pin16 (init) is normal, I think (~5Vcc). Does voltage change occurs <strong>only</strong> with the EPROM burner connected to the parallel port? I'm using a vertical trimpot, and my connections are:
<br />
<br /><img src="http://img213.imageshack.us/img213/3830/trimpot7tk.jpg" alt="Image" />
<br />
<br />Is this right?
<br />
<br />2 - I didn't use the 240ohms resistor, since I'm unable to find this measure  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_eek.gif" alt=":shock:" title="Shocked" /> So, I'm using a 270ohms instead. I think there's no problem...
<br />
<br />3 - So, what do you think about the LM317 voltage? Does my trimpot is wired correctly?
<br />
<br />4 - And.... if you connect the pin 32 to 5Vcc, How can the programmer burn/read 27C256, witch has 28 pins?  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_confused.gif" alt=":?" title="Confused" /> 
<br />
<br />My initial tests where done <strong>without</strong> connect to the parallel port, because I must make the cable first. Btw, I've included all the capacitors mentioned by Mike Gordon mod.
<br />
<br />
<br />Sorry for bother you, but I'm very confident cool about this project.  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /> 
<br />
<br />Cheers

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />1) You must connect the 5V+ to pin 32 of the EPROM socket. Otherwise you will not be able to use any 32 pin EPROM
<br />2)You seem to have connected the trimpot as a fixed resistor. That is likely why the voltage is not changing. The connection to the wiper arm must be used. One of the other connectors must be used as the other connection to the trimpot. You really should use a multiturn trimpot for the variable resistor as it will be very hard to set the Vpp otherwise. The multiturn ones are only a few cents more.
<br />3)Using a 270 Ohm resistor will change the voltage range. Likely you will still be able to set the proper Vpp. Try it out and if you can't, use a 240 Ohm, they are readily available. I'll even mail you one if you want.
<br />4)When you use the Eprom software it tells you how to set the dipswitches. For the 28 pin ones pin 28 gets 5V+. For the 32 pin ones, A17 goes to pin 30. You must always put the EPROM at the "lower" end of the socket so the pins are aligned properly.
<br />5)I get the feeling that this is sort of new to you. I'm not being critical. I've made tons of crazy mistakes such as vaporizing tools and frying components. However, I advise you to check each connection at least 3 times before trying it out. I make a separate copy of the schematic and check off every connection as I use a multimeter to check the actual connection. I also check all adjacent pins and connectors to make sure they don't connect where they shouldn't. Even then I still pick up some errors. Keep trying, it's lots of fun getting stuff to work.
<br />6)Don't make a parallel port cable. It's wasted work. I just soldered a 25 pin connector to the EPROM'er board and it sticks directly into the computer parallel port with no cable at all. It's very convenient, cheap and easy and avoids problems with long cables.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Hi, <strong>Lloyd Gordon</strong>! Your tips are awesome! I've waited years (seriously) for someone to help me in this project!!  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /> 
<br />
<br />1 - I take all your tips as a bless. You're right, I'm not too good with electronics, altough I have some knowledge and a digital multimeter. I keep checking all the connection and fixed various of them. Also, I made some extra holes in the board, in order to make changes in a more simple way. However, I'm reading EPROM/NES stuff for years, and only now I'm feeling able to do this project.
<br />
<br />2 - Just like I've suspected: the ZWS project has an error about the pin32 of the socket. I was wondering: how can the eprom has power suply without this connection? I've included some extra holes for this purpose, and it's only a matter of wire a jumper.
<br />
<br />3 - Yes, just like I've figured. My trimpot connection is wired like a common 10K resistor. So, I must wire pin 1 to somewhere. Ground? And can I free pin 2 or 3 instead?
<br />
<br />Is the "wiper" arm the pin 1 of the trimpot in the picture, right? And I don't know about "multiturn trimpot" (sorry, but english is not my natural language) Can you point me to some pictures of this component?
<br />
<br />4 - Can you believe I was unable to find a 240ohms resistor in here? The only measures I could find was 220 and 270ohms. Very strange. Thank you for your offer, but I really don't want to bother you. I'll try with the 270ohms resistor and if things burn out, I'll use the 240 instead.  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /> 
<br />
<br />5 - I've choice the parallel cable for some reasons. The mais reason is because I was unable do make correct holes in order to wire the DB25 connector 90º directly. So I decided to make this cable (less than 1 meter, like recommended). Also, it's interesting for me to operate the unit while sited down to my computer chair.  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_lol.gif" alt=":lol:" title="Laughing" /> Finally, there's a serious space problem in my room....
<br />
<br />6 - I'll remember the correct position of the 28pin EPROMs. Good advice!
<br />
<br />7 - My plugpack suplies a maximum voltage of 12Vcc. Do you think it's enough or should I buy a 18Vcc like recommended?
<br />
<br />Thanks!

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />The lack of a 5V+ connection was not actually a mistake on the schematic. Lots of things are left off schematics as they are "understood". This is one of them. Another is the use of 0.1 uf bypass capacitors from ground to the 5V+ on each IC. These should be as close as possible to the IC's to bypass voltage transients and are good practice. The variable resistor in this circuit needs only two leads connected but one must be the one connecting to the wiper arm. One of the other two leads is left open. Multiturn variable resistors look like little rectangular or square boxes with 3 leads and a screw head. They take multiple 360 degree turns to go through the full resistance range and are much easier and more stable to use. If the wall-wart power is not high enough then the Vpp might drop below the critical level on a EPROM write operation. This would be very buggy. Best to go higher than the 12V+ but it might be Ok.
