That would give you 64k PRG (two 32k banks at $8000-FFFF), but it'd be tricky to work with:<br /><br />To access the second bank, you'd need to point the PPU to either $1000-1FFF, or $3000-3FFF, and do it at a time where the PPU will <em>stay</em> there, such as from within vblank (<strong>Warning:</strong> the bank will spontaneously switch back to the first bank once vblank ends) or while rendering is off (safest). Obviously, this means you cannot manipulate the palette unless you do it from the second bank.<br /><br />You <em>must</em> set both the bg and the sprites to use $0000-0FFF, or else the screen rendering will cause spontaneous bank switches.<br /><br />Since the second bank isn't freely available, you'd only be able to store data there that you can fetch during a screen transition, or from within vblank (if you can do it before it ends, that is). An interesting idea would be to use 4kb CHR-RAM, to compensate for the reduced pattern table. To load tiles from the first bank, write them to $0xxx; to load them from the second bank, write them to $1xxx. I personally would keep the graphics in the second bank, since the only time you can update the pattern tables coincides with the only time you can access the second bank. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" />

Saving 10cents on not putting a discrete mapper on the PCB.  Yeah you're saving 10cents on a board design, but it's hard to begin to think the large cost you have to the loss in PT data and restricted access to your extra 'bank' is somehow worth all the hassle.<br /><br />The only point to try what you're saying is just for an exercise.  There's no real value there worth expending the effort to try it out...  <br /><br />If you're that excited about it try it out yourself! <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />  We're not stopping ya, and we'll be here to comment on your results as always. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" />

I could see this being very useful for applications that wouldn't need much character space, like a text adventure. In a similar way to how we use VBlank to update the PPU, in such a program you might have a VBlank handler that pulls data from storage banks.<br /><br />I might have to write up a Nintendulator mapper for this <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /> It's so interesting and it'd be a nice break from what I'm working on.

We then took off and ran with our babbling in typical fashion and started dreaming up mapper ideas like we all love to do.<br /><br />The other thing is if you come up with an idea you love and want to see come to life, generally you've got to to the heavy lifting yourself.  Other people may like your idea and think it's novel, but they have ideas of their own generally and desire to spend time doing the things they dream up.  It's not us 'not caring' it's just a discussion that we enjoy engaging in regardless of whether what we're rambling on about will ever see the light of day.  It's just the nesdev way...<br /><br />Don't be too hard yourself.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Interestingly, this might play nicely with mapper 218 (chrless). It looks like you might even be able to &quot;free up&quot; PPU A11 by restricting the tiles used to the lowest 128, and always fixing Y scroll to 0. A10's definitely not available because of the 34 pattern table fetches per scanline.<br /><br />In terms of practicality, cribbing something from the Vs. System and connecting OUT2 to an expansion port pin makes for a saner experience. But this idea is kinda hilarious to me.

Very few things (MMC5, the <a href="http://kevtris.org/mappers/nes_custom/NES_21G_CPU_72P.html" class="postlink">Expansion port test</a> cartridge) used them in its commercial lifetime. A few others are used by 60-to-72 pin converters and the CopyNES.<br /><br />The OUT1 and OUT2 pins from the CPU are on the 48-pin NES expansion port, so a wire could connect either or both to an underallocated EXPx pin to make those signals available to any cartridge. This is probably what I'd do if I were trying to make a &quot;Vs NES&quot; system.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">Also, does anyone know if they function of Famiclones?</div>The OUT1 and OUT2 pins have to be available on &quot;full&quot; famiclones with the DA15 Famicom expansion port connector. Zzo38 pointed out that one could reuse the IRQ line (at the cost of disabling IRQs and so not getting any IRQs from the APU) on those systems. But I don't know just how available that would actually be.

Not very handy, and completely incompatible with the FC. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" /><br /><br />It's kind of a shame; the NES could've had a software-controlled latch whose bits could be fed directly to the cart (and then to the upper address lines), and there you go; bankswitching done by the NES itself instead of a mapper. It'd be like a GNROM or a CNROM depending on how the cart's wired, and it'd require no extra hardware on the cart. With four bits, you could address 512kb of PRG (with chr-ram, unless you want fixed CHR), but CHR would be tricky because you'd only be able to swap the whole 8kb at a time without a mapper. I wonder if that would've had any significant impact on costs, both of the console and of cartridges.

(Nintendo abandoned bringing the FDS to North America after widespread copyright infringement of FDS games began to cut into publishers' earnings.)
