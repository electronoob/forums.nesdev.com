		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Even though I always thought 3d polygons looked ugly until 7th generation systems, I always thought jumping from 2d to 3d was the biggest leap in video game graphics.  From researching technical specs I can also make a point that it was also the biggest leap in processor efficiency.<br /><br />Reasons:<br />- Memory was finally large enough for double buffering.<br />- Memory was finally fast enough for GPUs to fetch a single pixel at a time, allowing individual pixel manipulation, as opposed to fetching groups of several pixels at a time.<br />- CDs got rid of some of the memory constraints of cartridges.<br />- Any design flaws of 4th gen systems such as the Genesis's lack of available colors, or SNES's unflexible sprite management.

N64 was nice and PS1 was okay, but there was a huge jump in graphics quality from PS1 and N64 to say PS2 and Xbox etc, that solidified 3D graphics as the future of console gaming. The 5th generation seemed experimental and maybe premature, and though it was a large jump in processing power so was the 6th generation.

Most of the 3d games at the time were really awful, though; IMO the solider games were ones that only lightly used the console's 3d capabilities.<br /><br />In my opinion, the transition from the 1st generation to the 2nd generation, when we finally got interchangeable game paks/cartridges, was so much more important.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Oh thank you very much guys.<br /><br />Well I don't know but 2 to 3 was probably the biggest lap, as games started to have decent graphics with multiple colours, recognizable characters and recognizable enemies. Also, games started to have storylines (even if they were cheap 99% of the time, there was games with true storylines here and there in the NES generation, such as Ninja Gaiden and so on).<br /><br />But I find there is a huge gap within the 3rd generation itself, I mean, compare Donkey Kong to Metal Slader Glory, it's quite incredible both are on the same NES, isn't it ? The former has the very early idea of recognizable character and enemies (actually the enemy gave it name to the game) while the later is a 1MB cartridge featuring large portraits of characters and probably a very complex storyline (although the game isn't translated yet).

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I think first to second was the biggest leap because we went from consoles dedicated (largely) to one single game to a cartridge/microprocessor architecture that allowed you to simply change cartridges to get a vastly different game, which is pretty much the foundation that modern consoles are based on, and what made them more like appliances and computers rather than toys. Every other generation is just better video and sound, which is still significant in itself, but nothing really as groundbreaking as &quot;this system can run a hypothetically infinite number of applications that all are unique&quot;.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />True, but the 3D leap was still important because it allowed for a behind-the-character viewpoint. Behind-the-character allows for far longer distances than a side or overhead view. Otherwise, when a character is moving rapidly across the landscape, the player can't react in time to obstacles or items that just scrolled into view. This let games get away from a &quot;world map&quot;, &quot;town map&quot;, and &quot;indoor map&quot; at three separate scales in favor of one seamless map, leading to the whole sandbox genre.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />4th to 5th (2D to 3D) was the biggest leap.<br /><br />It was just a different world going from tile-map style side-scrolling graphics to more or less a free-roaming kind of game style.<br /><br />But I do remember it was more smooth of a transition given what the arcade machines were doing in the late 80's to early 90's. 5th generation was when the processing power necessary to match them became affordable to the home market. But it was also the first generation where it became infeasible for a one-person operation to produce, package, and sell a game. So for a time it was an explosion of fresh new game studios and new ideas.<br /><br />On the technical side, it became necessary to develop the 3D cad tools that non-technical artists could use. Everything that wasn't &quot;3D&quot; looking was deemed antiquated (for a time). Though there are still some hints of this where certain fighting games tout the &quot;hand-drawn&quot; characters as a sort of throwback selling point. Motion capture (mo-cap) was also a really big deal in this 3D era, as it turns out that natural-looking motion is incredibly difficult to fake.<br /> <br /><br />As for anomalies, or games ahead of their time:<br />It seems one can always find a game of a previous generation that used the ideas or technologies prevalent in the subsequent generation.

If anything, I would say the exclusion of a separate sound processor - since the snes and genesis had those.

No affine matrix transformations. No native sample playback (no reverb). 15bpp color is finally large enough that you no longer have to figure out how to work around it (/ are freed from the paralysis of infinite choice). There are a few linear improvements here, too: half as many sprites, twice as many palettes, eight times as many directly-enumerable tiles, one more dotclock...<br /><br />I'm probably missing some things, and I haven't any background to speak on behalf of other contemporary machines.
