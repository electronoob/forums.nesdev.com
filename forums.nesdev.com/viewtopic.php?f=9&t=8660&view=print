<br />
<br />As you can see the Powerpak loads and it has played any ROM on it including a NES test cart that checked out ok assuming it can work that way.
<br />
<br />Now you are probably wondering whats the problem. 
<br />It won't play all regular cart games, such as SMB3 as an original cart that works in a normal NES won't play but loading it with the Powerpak it plays fine.
<br />
<br />So I could use some help figuring this out cause I would like to make it work with all carts.
<br />
<br />Using the schematic from the PlayChoice and a pinout of the 72pin connector I hooked it up straight forward except on a few lines where on PlayChoice carts they go through a buffer. These lines would be VRAM /CE, PRG ROM /CE and CHR /A13, the buffer is a 74367.
<br />
<br />It would also be nice to know how the M82 does its selecting.
<br />
<br />Let me know what you think.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />PRG /CE is combined with A14 and A13 to form the PRG RAM select signal. In previous discussions about building such a decoder circuit to add to a discrete mapper, I learned that it's made with a 74LS139 on the NES motherboard and thus delayed a few dozen nanoseconds compared to A14 and A13. Different MMC3 revisions might have different tolerances for this delay. Do Crystalis and M.C. Kids have problems when played through this adapter? They had problems on early versions of the MMC3 mapper for PowerPak because writing to the IRQ enable ports ($E000-$FFFF) would end up also writing to PRG RAM ($6000-$7FFF).

<br />
<br />Also explains why the Powerpak works but real carts don't.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Actually I'm not sure why, in your example, SMB3 would work on PowerPak, but not with an original cartridge.  Have you tried removing every other game from the Playchoice?
<br />
<br />Once I do some testing I can let you know if I find a fix for it, unfortunately I don't have any good answers yet.
