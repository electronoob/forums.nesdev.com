FF2 is definitely the NES game on about 90% of cases. Long ago, the FF series was pretty unknown out of japan, so people in states wouldn't care with the numbers. Since FF4 on SNES was released just a year after FF1 on NES in the states, it wouldn't make so strange to call it FF2.<br />With the advance of the popularity of the series, many people discovered FF2j on NES and FF4 on SNES, that was officially FF2 in the states after the release of FF7, so everyone is calling the games with their real numbers rather than the fake US numbers, exept the few people that had knonw the games before the series become more popular.<br /><br />Well, if I say "I played this game on my NES", or "I tested this on my NES", it really means the real NES. I cannot see any ambiguation here, so Blargg is right.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=38">Bregalad</a> — Wed Apr 26, 2006 9:21 am</p><hr />

Heh tokumaru. What has come out is that there are two issues with real: it is often redundant, and where it isn't, it's vague. "Real NES" might mean "NES hardware, not an emulator" or "genuine NES, not a clone". My original claim that an unqualified "NES" is sufficient has been refuted to some extent by this, since in some contexts it might refer to the architecture (as in when comparing system capabilities), in which case an emulator is just as valid as hardware. So I'll change my recommendation: use a more descriptive qualifier like "hardware" or "genuine" or "architecture" instead of "real", and only if it's not already clear from the context.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=17">blargg</a> — Tue Apr 25, 2006 3:12 pm</p><hr />

You'll still want to have patched rom of most games that are japaneese only just because you don't undestand a word of japaneese. Some translations break the ROMs, but if you got a decent translation it usually don't, and, it is possible to modify the rom to be fixed. Of couse, burning a cart with this is less "real" than the real cartridge, but more "real" than playing it under an emulator. It is mid-real that way. Thats what I was saying above, play a false game on the real hardware.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=38">Bregalad</a> — Tue Apr 25, 2006 12:45 pm</p><hr />

There could be if you hacked the game to run under PAL timing, like I did with FF2 (or hack the game for other purposes).<br /><br />It could also differ it you use a bad translation patch that works under emulation, but not on the hadware (notice the avoiding of the word "real", we should all start to take that habbit, right ?). I also had to hack FF2 to work under the hardware, because the intro screen of the translation was designed for Nesticle...<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=38">Bregalad</a> — Tue Apr 25, 2006 9:11 am</p><hr />

You're absolutely right.<br />So, saying "real NES" definitly is dull, because just "NES" is enough to say it is real, since nobody will claim his emulators to be a NES. Famiclones, etc... are definitely not NES also, so you're right.<br />However, this applies to the console, but not to games.

Asking about games is different, since having the data is virtually equivalent to having the cartridge. Having a NES emulator is quite different than having a NES. These two points can be illustrated by the following:<br /><br />"Yeah, I have Tales of Phantasia"<br />"Yeah, I have a NES"<br /><br />The first might mean the cartridge or merely the data, while only a very clueless person would claim to have a NES when he only had an emulator.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=17">blargg</a> — Mon Apr 24, 2006 11:16 am</p><hr />
