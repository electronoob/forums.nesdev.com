Two player mode is still just two instances of the same story. Otherwise you also have to invent a second Donkey Kong Junior.<br />Also, the NES verson of the first game called the number of lives &quot;M&quot;, for &quot;Mario&quot;. It doesn't switch to &quot;L&quot; for the second player.

Luigi didn't even get his name until NOA came up with it for Mario Bros and Miyamoto heard of it and accepted it.<br /><br />Yeah that doesn't really work with Donkey Kong Jr or Donkey Kong 3 (unless Stanley has a twin).

	</div>Not quite finished yet but it was simple enough to implement, though I don't expect to fix every little detail (e.g screenshots aren't going to be in the correct orientation because the rotation is done in hardware, etc.).  Filters, scaling and aspect ratio options work correctly, which seems good enough for this.

Would be cool to recommend one that actually supports the orientation. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" />

Then the lag is really noticeable. I know that because I noticed the lag before I even knew that something like input lag exists.<br /><br />This doesn't have anything to do with the emulator, though, but with Direct3D. I made extensive tests and found out that Direct3D with vsync has input lag where DirectDraw doesn't (or at least it's much less).<br /><br />The way I checked this:<br />I mapped one of the buttons to Shift Lock.<br />Then I held a camera with a 60 fps recording function in front of the screen, so that it records the screen and the keyboard at once.<br />I press the Shift Lock key to make Mario in &quot;Super Mario Bros.&quot; jump. Then I check the video.<br />Since pressing Shift Lock is mapped to an LED on the keyboard, I can count the number of frames from the LED lighting up to the moment Mario jumps on screen.<br />This way, I can measure the difference in input lag between different configurations. And Direct3D in fullscreen with vsync always loses against the other configurations.

Windowed mode seems to be fine, but you don't really want that for serious play, would you?<br />And fceux is DirectDraw-based anyway. (And their vsync doesn't looks as clean as the Nestopia or MAME one.)<br />So, yeah, try out the fullscreen version with an emulator where you know it's Direct3D and see how it adds three additional frames of lag.<br /><br />My test emulator was MAME. This one lets you switch between DirectDraw and Direct3D.
