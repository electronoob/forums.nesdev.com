That's a really open-ended question. But...<br /><br />One thing I do is when I know I can get to a certain section code I'll add a label right there if one doesn't exist... I use WLA to export a symbol file which gives me the ROM address, then in BSNES debugger I set a breakpoint at that ROM address.. then I step thru the code and do my thing...<br /><br />but there's different approaches for all different types of problems.. BSNES debugger also lets me set breakpoints on a read/write of memory.. even lets me  break on when certain values are read/write IIRC...<br /><br />Sometimes I might do a trace from one point to another and analyze the code in between the trace points.<br /><br />I dunno what else to say to you cause there's loads of possible situations, calling for all different approaches <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /><p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=4992">bazz</a> — Sun Jan 18, 2015 10:04 am</p><hr />

This &quot;romless&quot; concept worked for &quot;multiboot&quot; games on the GBA, and it could work for entries to a collaborative Super NES multicart. INL could sell a &quot;coder's cable&quot; bundle with a bootloader cart and a USB cable. Heck, if the Cypress is fast enough, a game could essentially mount the cartridge as a block device and DMA things to RAM that way, using the computer on the other end as a makeshift SSD.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=9">tepples</a> — Fri Jan 16, 2015 2:24 pm</p><hr />

I mostly use no$sns for debugging, it's very easy to use for most homebrew debugging tasks, doesn't work too well on linux sadly.<br />However no$sns lacks watchpoints, which forces me to use other emulators for that, such as bsnes.<br />I use <a href="https://code.google.com/p/bsnes-classic/" class="postlink">this version</a>. There are some other bsnes debuggers around if you go digging but they're all a bit unwieldy and unintuitive compared to no$sns in my opinion.<br />Then there's mess which is even slower than bsnes-accuracy and not as accurate, and there's no vram viewer. But it has a pretty good interface, so if your computer is fast enough it might be useful. It's also the only emulator that currently seems to support proper coprocessor debugging beyond the spc700.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=6115">ARM9</a> — Thu Jan 15, 2015 9:53 am</p><hr />

My methodology for debugging is that first, I try to analyze RAM (as well as have the actual code up in both the hex editor and a text file: the hex editor allows me to analyze the compiled code, while the text file allows me to match it up with the compiled ASM). If I have to resort to a step-by-step method of analyzing what went wrong in the assembly, then I transfer the ROM file to my Windows laptop and use no$sns and laevateinn for a step-by-step code analysis. no$sns is more complete, but has the usual inaccuracies for me to worry about. laevateinn is based on I believe higan v08x, and thus has more accurate step-by-step code, but it has incomplete implementation (I have no gripes about this, as it's good enough for me). Both debuggers have both 65C816 and SPC700 available, so I'll need those especially when I finally get to programming my own sound driver for the SPC700.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3572">KungFuFurby</a> — Thu Jan 15, 2015 8:39 am</p><hr />
