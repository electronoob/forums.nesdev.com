Or does Pal is fairly irrelevant on computers? Have no clue about that. I could also still try out another NES NTSC rom to see if the same problem occurs.

It might be just a PAL ROM incorrectly identified or labeled as NTSC though.<br /><br />這是對的，但樓主說他已是用 NTSC 的 ROM，所以<em>正常來說</em>在 NTSC 的主機 (實機或模擬也是) 上玩應沒有問題，而在 PAL 的主機上則<em>只會更慢</em>，不過可能樓主用的 ROM 其實是誤標為 NTSC 的 PAL ROM 而已。

Will try out with other emulators later. Rom has (U) in name.<br /><br />Edit: When I use Fceux and pick Pal, it kinda slows down. But not constantly, but more like having a frame-skip every second. It essentially runs the same pace, but lags for a brief moment which makes it feel slowed down.
