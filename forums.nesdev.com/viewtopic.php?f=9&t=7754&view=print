<br />
<br />Specifically, the comments from tepples and Memblers about decapping specific mappers in order to fully realize/replicate their activity piqued my interest. My understanding is that the major mapper chips (MMC1, MMC3, MMC5) are no longer being produced by anybody, requiring homebrew developers and reproduction-seekers to sacrifice existing carts. 
<br />
<br />Would the information obtained by the aforementioned decapping process allow for the eventual reproduction of these mapper chips themselves? What exactly does it take to physically program and produce such a thing?

<br />
<br />Some of the very exotic custom mappers from non-domestic games and pirate carts could benefit from this, however there is not much of a demand as most of them are already emulated well enough to play the games.
<br />
<br />You really only need that low-level understanding if you want to create a physical cart that runs the original software.
<br />
<br />Or am I off base on that?

<br />25 latches actually (I guess you forgot the temporary shift register).
<br />
<br />Unfortunately the MMC1 is a known unknown as well : I think the effect of RMW instrucitons on the MMC1 is still mysterious, such as the difference between original MMC1, MMC1A, MMC1B1 and MMC1B2.

We already know how to describe the behavior of the MMC5 well enough to emulate existing software, and with some trial and error we can reproduce the behavior as described in hardware.<br /><br />This is the kind of thing I like to refer to as implementing the iNES mapper as opposed to the actual mapper. There are two camps on this issue, one arguing that it is perfectly acceptable, the other arguing that if we implement such a mapper, then figure out how the MMC5 "really" works that it will somehow implode the universe <img src="./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=":wink:" title="Wink" /><br /><br />Either way an MMC5 reproduction is going to be very expensive. Programmable logic alone is not up to the task (due to the built-in 1KB EXRAM), so you would have to use multiple IC's and work out all of the timing issues there. A custom ASIC is going to be way too expensive for a hobby (or small to medium sized commercial) project (I think).<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">Dr. Floppy wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">Also, if someone wanted to create their own custom mapper (pirates do it; why can't the "good guys"?) based on MMC5, what information/level of detail would they need and what would be the best way of acquiring it?</div>
<br />
<br />We do <img src="./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /> The only down side is that if you build a custom mapper cart it will not be compatible with existing emulators. This is not a problem if you do all of your development on the hardware and do not want folks to be able to emulate your game. Some of us fall into this category, most of us do not. It has been discussed at length <img src="./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" />
<br />
<br />As for MMC5 info and creating custom mappers based on it I will link to our recent discussions about it. If you have the hardware skills to pull this stuff off I will gladly bend over backwards to help you get the information and support you need.

<br />And here is a thread where we discussed using a sub-set of the MMC5 (note that I lack the hardware skills to pull this project off, as it turns out <img src="./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" />) <a href="http://nesdev.com/bbs/viewtopic.php?t=7650" class="postlink">http://nesdev.com/bbs/viewtopic.php?t=7650</a>
