There's little reason to to so, and it just clutters up the thread. Several users on this and other boards regularly quote the immediately previous message, and it's quite annoying.
<br />
<br />I'm thinking that the script that initially fills the message with the quote of the previous message could save this text, then later see if the message being posted begins with the same text, and remove it if so. But maybe it doesn't maintain any state on the server side, making this a non-starter.

<br />Sometimes I quote part of the previous message in order to indicate what specific part of it I'm replying to or is relevant to my post (like I did now). By your logic I wouldn't be able to indicate that I'm answering something asked in the beginning of the previous post.

The software would see that I simply added text to the end, and strip off the quote, so it would be as if I had simply typed the message into a blank box.

<br />It should only strip out in the case I outlined, where the immediately previous message is quoted in its entirety. All other cases are legitimate; you may want to quote a portion of the immediately previous message, to set context for yours, or you may want to quote an entire message before the immediately previous one, again, to set context. Context is the central point. If you reply without any quote, you're in the context set by the immediately previous message, thus you don't need to quote it in its entirety.

<br />
<br />In other words, unless the quoted message is a huge wall of text and images, followed only by a tiny sentence, I'm not annoyed (what I described though is annoying even if the quoted message isn't the one immediately before).

<br />The main idea here is that there's no reason a person whould have to be careful to avoid this, when it can be automated. In fact, if one were really anal, one could apply this retroactively, cleaning up a board. I've read boards where people do this all the time, and it's really tiring when you've experienced times when it doesn't occur much. There's a kind of mental "ugh noise, skim thread less carefully" mode that develops in response to it, which lowers the quality of discussion IMO.

<br />I get what you mean. In here it doesn't bother me so much, because this a somewhat slow/small forum and threads never grow 10 pages overnight (which reduces the need to "skim less carefully"), but I have been bothered by this elsewhere.
<br />
<br />I don't know if someone is up to the task of coding this though... The principle sure is simple, but I don't know if messing with the board's system this much is.

<br />
<br />And yeah, I wasn't demanding this be implemented, just throwing out some ideas for what seemed like relatively simple implementations.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />blargg, I read this thread and I think I understand what you're getting at.  You're basically wanting quoting of the entire previous message (keyword here is **entire**) silently stripped from the post, unless the user edits the quoted portion (slims it down, etc.).
<br />
<br />Do I understand correctly?  If so, yeah, I think that's possible, however I'm not sure it really solves the problem.  Users always find a way to achieve what they want; if quoting the entire thing is auto-stripped, they'll learn that, and then start doing something like adding a newline after the closing ] for the quote, or doing who knows what else.  I see this happen pretty regularly on other forums (users basically "abusing" the system so they can get what they want).
<br />
<br />Implementing what you want straightforward is possible (I could probably do this), but... well, if you have ideas on how to deal with the above, I'm all ears.

<br />Yeah, but only if it's a fairly trivial thing to do.
<br />
<br />The point of the simplistic algorithm isn't to prevent a user from quoting the entire immediately previous message; it's just to prevent him from doing so unless he specifically wants to. If such a filter were implemented and some user intentionally kept bypassing it by adding a newline or extra text inside the quote, then he either has a good reason to, or is just trying to make trouble; if the latter, warn/ban is clearly in order. So it's to prevent accidental/lazy unnecessary quoting, not intentional abuse.
<br />
<br />As Banshaku says, you could do so entirely via admins, but many people do this unncessary quoting often, I'm guessing due to lazyness or haste. Again, if it can be easily automated, then that makes more sense, and can eliminate more of the unnecessary quoting without having to manually contact users.
<br />
<br />Again, I posted this because a) I had thought of a possibly simple way to implement it, and b) I believe it contributes to a noticeable reduction in signal-to-noise ratio, by adding visual clutter. I believe that when encountering it often, you become less careful in reading posts, since your "something repeated, start skimming to find new text" trigger threshold gets necessarily lowered. I don't want any special treatment, just to
