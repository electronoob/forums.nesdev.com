		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Hi !<br /><br />I'm trying to improve my video emulation, and now only a couple of games still have issues.<br /><br />One of those is this video with the intro of pokemon. I read the other thread, implemented that additional OAM 2 interrupt, and it plays till the end.<br /><br />However, something is wrong on my tiles logic, video looks jerky.<br /><br />The game manages to do the graphics by changing the scroll Y register when in mode 3, to different coloured tiles, with accurate timings, each line is rendered with this precise method. Quality of each frame is terrible.<br /><br />But then I discovered the games does a little trick to &quot;duplicate&quot; the quality of each frame, turns out the game changes the scroll X register between 0 and 4 every frame, to simulate a better quality. I guess with a real gameboy LCD blending each frame, it looks better.<br /><br />My emulator, when scroll X is changed to 4, it doesn't change anything, since the tiles are just solid colours (doesn't change in the X axis), it just does exactly the same as when the scroll X is 0.<br /><br />I see that BGB, when scrollX = 4, cuts the first 4 pixels of all the vertical tiles in the first column, and then draws the rest as usual. What's the logic behind this ?<br /><br />I'm also having distorted letters in the lava tunnel from the demotronic demo, which I think it's also related to this. Weird thing is that scrolling works perfectly in all other games. So it looks like I'm missing some edge case here ?<br /><br />Thanks !

Basically what happens (of course, this is a theory that I can't prove, but I couldn't prove it incorrect either) is this: On mode 3, the LCDC renders 8 pixels at a time. These pixels must be <strong>aligned to a tile</strong>. So if the SCX % 8 is 0, it all &quot;works&quot; as expected, and it first draws the first 8 pixels, then the next 8, and so on.<br /><br />However, if SCX % 8 = 4, the first (leftmost) pixel it has to render on a line is not aligned to a tile. Therefore, in order to align itself to a tile the LCDC only renders the first 4 pixels at its first iteration. Then it continues drawing the next 8 pixels, and the next 8, and so on.<br /><br />Since the LCDC renders a single color in each iteration in GBVP, this causes the entire image to be shifted left 4 pixels.<br /><br />This effect is <a href="https://github.com/LIJI32/GBVideoPlayer/blob/master/How%20It%20Works.md" class="postlink">entirely documented</a> at GBVP's Github.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />The actual effect in this specific case is indeed simple scrolling, but it is definitely not obvious that it would work this way because GBVideoPlayer doesn't render by tiles. Remember the image GBVideoPlayer constructs with its tilemap and tileset (Right part in the picture below) is just plain horizontal lines and draws it frames with SCY hacks, so theocratically SCX shouldn't have had any effect on this.<br /><br /><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LIJI32/GBVideoPlayer/master/doc_images/scroll_animation.gif" alt="Image" /><br /><br />What I'm describing isn't <strong>what</strong> the LCDC is rendering, but <strong>when</strong> does it render each pixel on a scanline, taking SCX into account. Note that in this specific case SCX = 0, SCX = 8, and SCX = 16 will look <strong>exactly the same</strong>, not shifting the image at all.<br /><br />Higan, BGB and SameBoy all correctly emulate this behavior <strong>in this specific scenario</strong>, but probably for different reasons since I never found any documentation of it. I haven't tried to create a test ROM that proves my theory incorrect. In fact, I highly suspect it is, but I don't have a better theory yet, mostly because I don't have an appropriate test ROM.<br /><br />I hope that explanation makes more sense now.<br /><br />Now considering Higan does support this behavior, what is your theory on this? Why would SCX even have an effect on that scenario? What would the timings be if you change SCX inside a scanline? That last question is where my theory breaks since this allows you to make a REALLY long scanline.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />tl;dr: A vertical scroll value affects an entire 8x1-pixel pattern sliver.<br /><br />Fine background scrolling on the NES is accomplished by feeding the pattern and attribute bits to the equivalent of four <a href="http://www.nxp.com/documents/data_sheet/74HC_HCT164.pdf" class="postlink">74164 serial-in, parallel-out shift registers</a> as a delay line, which produces pixel data delayed by 1 to 8 pixels on the 8 outputs, and then selecting a tap through the equivalent of four <a href="http://www.nxp.com/documents/data_sheet/74HC_HCT151.pdf" class="postlink">74151 8-to-1 multiplexers</a>. But the addresses of the nametable and pattern bytes don't depend on the scroll value at the time the pixel is output but on the coarse scroll value at the time the pattern data is fetched.<br /><br />I remember reading in <a href="http://blog.kevtris.org/blogfiles/Nitty%20Gritty%20Gameboy%20VRAM%20Timing.txt" class="postlink">kev's Game Boy timing doc</a> that the LCD operates slightly differently from the NES and Super NES PPU because it's allowed to pause the LCD's pixel clock. Thus instead of using a SIPO+mux as a delay, it can just not clock the LCD for the first SCX%8 pixels. But I imagine it still uses the scroll value at the time a sliver of pattern data is fetched, and the fetches occur on a regular cadence: one every eight pixels as on the NES.<br /><br />The big <em>observable</em> timing differences between NES-style SIPO+mux rendering and Game Boy-style are twofold: The Game Boy may pause between the main background and the window, and mid-line changes to fine SCX might not work as expected.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Managed to answer my own question with a test ROM – Changing SCX while on a scan line has no effect. I tested the ROM on a real Gameboy Color, BGB, Gambatte and SameBoy (Higan 0.99 won't compile on my Mac and I don't have a 64-bit Windows VM).<br /><br />Gambatte's result is what a real CGB really displays, SameBoy and BGB fail. This means the LCDC ignores changes in SCX if they happen during a scanline. The test ROM basically has consecutive inc [hl] (hl = SCX) instructions during the entire scanline.<br /><br />I attached the ROM and the results.

But like with everything on the DMG, nobody really knows what the hell is going on and it's all guesswork that's never fully confirmed by anyone. So take that with all of the salt in the pacific ocean.

So changes to SCX mid-scanline go ignored precisely because it isn't even checked in the first place.<br /><br />Do new values still remain for the next scanline though or is the write actually masked out?
