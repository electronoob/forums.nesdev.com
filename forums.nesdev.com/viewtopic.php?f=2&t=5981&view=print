		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I have been testing how to do some mid-frame vertical scrolling while using the MMC3 IRQ today since some part of the MM9 demo (robo master presentation for example) will require it. So I had to understand how it work since I will need it sooner or later.  
<br />
<br />I was able to make it work to some satisfying results by hard coding a few tests here and there but there is one thing left, this:
<br />
<br /><img src="http://i389.photobucket.com/albums/oo335/banshaku/ScrollArtifact.png" alt="Image" />
<br />
<br />I guess I already know my answer but is there a way to remove that glitchy line?  Since so many commercial games have it, the answer must be no.  I would like to know what cause it in the first place?

<br />
<br />Edit:
<br />
<br />The nop did help. I wouldn't consider 38 "a few nop" but it does work for now on most accurate emulator. I need to test it on hardware though. I may consider to use it to scroll the map since it's not as complicated as I thought. The only problem is to integrate it properly in my current system.
<br />
<br />Edit2:
<br />
<br />By the way, the same mid frame vertical scrolling effect by IRQ can be reproduced on an MMC5/VRCIV/VI etc or is it limited to the MMC3?

<br />It works on anything with a scanline counter or a CPU counter, although it's a bit trickier to use the VRCs' CPU counters on a PAL NES because their divisor is designed for NTSC.

<br />Great, this is what I was hoping. It could be useful later if I do decide to make more stages (one require some very special timing that could only be done on MMC5).
<br />
<br />I tested on hardware and there was no artifact. The split was not 100%, maybe I wrote 1 raster too late or something. If I cannot fix it, you don't have much time to see that issue well so it's better than the artifact. Good, I can use it to scroll the screen.  That annoying missing metatile row is not an issue anymore.
<br />
<br />Thanks everyone for the information.
