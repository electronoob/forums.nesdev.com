<br />
<br />WHAT!?  Are you kidding me?  It's supposed to be that bright!  The problem with the original AV mod for the top loader is that it still had the vertical bars and too dark.
<br />
<br />If it's too bright, lower the brightness on your TV.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Did the mod, so far so good =) There's still some bars on the screen, but I'm hoping it's because I'm not finished yet.
<br />
<br />I had I taken out the resistors connected to Q1 and ran a wire from Q1 to my amp, that might be causing some of it. I just finished redoing my amp with Q1 on it.
<br />
<br />I don't know if this might be causing any of it, but I couldn't find any 560 pf capacitors, so I put four other ones I found in parallel (330, 30, 100, 100). In theory, this should be the same, but I feel kinda sloppy doing it this way. The only 560s I could find at Radio Shack came in a variety pack of 100, for $4.50, so I guess I will have to find out where the heck to get cheaper parts around here.
<br />
<br />Finally, since I was just making sure it worked, I just used regular wire. I'll have to go find out where the spare twisted pair is tomorrow. Hopefully that'll clear the picture up a good deal, it already looks loads better than it did before.

<br />The only other thing I can think of is to try to find some way to lift pin 21.
<br />
<br />Guess for now I'll just put it back together and be happy that it's cleaner than it was before.
<br />
<br />Edit: Yeah, something's definitely wrong. I was playing for a few minutes, and now I can't get any picture at all, just slightly squiggled black screen =( I still get sound, so hopefully that means it's not fried &gt;_&lt;

<br />I went back and reread most of this thread, looking for clues. RT9342 was right, there must be some interference coming from the lines near the one between Q1 and pin 21. I even had taken out Q1 and all the nearby resistors, with the wire soldered directly onto pin 21, and still lines. I took the plunge and lifted pin 21, and now my picture is crystal clear.
<br />
<br />Dunno what the screen going black was all about, it's not doing it anymore =)
<br />
<br />Anyway, pretty excited to have the best NES possible. Thanks a ton, you guys =D
<br />
<br />Someone oughtta link this around a bit <img src="./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" />
<br />
<br />Edit: Just a small tip if anyone needs it, I took some of the ethernet wire that was leftover, wrapped it around the pin (after desoldering it, of course), and gently tugged at it with some pliers. Possibly not the best way to do it, but it got the job done.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />It isn't necessarily the best <em>signal</em> possible or nearly the best circuit by default since it needs the specific Japanese transistor and sounds like it needs the ferrite choke. Has it been compared to other GENERIC small signal transistor amplifiers? I bet any common collector amp with that same transistor would perform the same. Before people hail Nintendo's cheap circuit as the end all, realize that a 2N3904 could be biased for the desired 1Vpp into 75ohms output.

<br />
<br />Maybe not, but the composite video quality is the same as a toaster NES, with the advantage of the proper cart slot, so I'm pretty happy.

<br />
<br />To reduce the lines,  lift Pin 21 from the PPU or disconnect the line from pin 21 to 2sc...transistor and solder the Video-Amp directly to the PPU. However, you always have some vertikal lines on some games (e.g. Bird Week), so please solder an 220uF electrolyt capacitor between PPU Pin 40 and GND. You also have to take the 5V for the Video Amp from PPU Pin 40 (...and 220uf capacitor) and not from an other 5V place from the PCB.
<br />
<br />Solder an 220uF electrolyt capacitor without lift Pin 21 from the PPU or vice versa don`t make it 100% stripes free.
<br />
<br />Greeting Markus

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Hello, this is my first post in this forum!
<br />
<br />My father and I have been trying to make an NES 2 get AV output by following this guide:
<br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.gamesx.com/rgbadd/nes2avmod.htm">http://www.gamesx.com/rgbadd/nes2avmod.htm</a><!-- m --> 
<br />
<br />I am not experienced in soldering and electronics and stuff, therefore I took help from my father who has worked with this for almost his whole life...
<br />
<br />Anyway, we completed this mod, and tried it. Sadly no signal came through to either video or audio. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" alt=":(" title="Sad" /> Still the RF-output seem to work as good/bad as usual, so the stuff that fixes so the RF-out still works, is working.
<br />
<br />Now to some questions:
<br />
<br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">Now comes the fun part. Remove the resistor labelled R3 (Right above the (c) 1993 in front of the cartridge port. After you've removed it, cut the trace running underneath it. </div>
<br />Is the resistor ment to be removed and never put back? We've tried the both, but neither worked. When we put back the resistor the RF-signal worked worse, almost not at all. And "cut the trace running underneath it" means the trace under the resistor? (I mean I don't have to flip the motherboard!?)
<br />
<br />Strange that not even the audio works. What could go wrong? My father soldered one wire to the audio point at picture #2.
<br />
<br />Why are we even bothering doing this mod? Well the NES2 doesn't work good with the RF on a PAL TV, the sound doesn't work at all. Well some sound come through while using the RF and fine tuning, but that quality is so bad so it's even better without it!
<br />
<br />Could the problem be that we use a PAL TV? Seems strange when the same TV works with with the first version of NES (both American and European) and also the AV Famicom...  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_confused.gif" alt=":?" title="Confused" />

<br />
<br />Should be two wires, one at the point in picture 2, and one connected to ground in picture 3.
<br />
<br />I'm not exactly sure what you're supposed to do with R3, the way that guide words it is a bit confusing. I've only <em>dis</em>assembled the guide at GamesX (or something similar), it's a bit different going that way.

<br />you should have 3 wires going to your RCA A/V jacks video, audio and ground... the ground wire goes to both jacks (outer connection) and the signals (audio &amp; video) to the center connection
<br />
<br />thats the only thing i can think of that would cause no sound or video...
<br />if its not the ground try pushing start on the control or putting a game in with start screen music.. that way you can test the sound proper <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />
<br />
<br />EDIT: oh one more thing if the page didn't say to put it back then you shouldn't.. not till you have sound anyway... it wont effect the sound because its part of the video amp <img src="./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" />
