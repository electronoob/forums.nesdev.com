		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />When I was browsing in a Japanese library near the office, there was a book about emulators in general for 2010. 
<br />
<br />My first reflex was to search what nes emulators would be mentioned it it. The list was:
<br />
<br />- Nestopia
<br />- FCE something
<br />- NesterJ
<br />- Rocknes
<br />
<br />That's it.  I was surprised that there was no mention of nintendulator at all.  I didn't take the time to read what they said about them but may try to do someday if I get the book.
<br />
<br />I guess Zepper will be happy to know that some people in japan talk about his emulator <img src="./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" />

<br />
<br />I'm pretty curious about the contents of this book now. I doubt it's very interesting (how much can one talk about emulation to the general public?), but at least this is an uncommon subject for books.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Yeah. I don't know how many of them I saw in the recent years. I was just curious when I saw "2010" tagged to it and gave it a look.  
<br />
<br />Most emulator books or PSP one seems to come often with illegals files too...  I don't know how they can tolerate that in japan. By illegal is it seems to imply that it comes with the files, for example, to flash your PSP with a pandora battery.. That seems to be a good incentive to help sell the book. They talk about "play custom soft on your PSP!" to make it look less illegal but that quite obvious that people that bought that book was not for homebrew but for pirating games. 
<br />
<br />There was many of them (for PSP) last year and they all disappeared suddenly. This one doesn't say about PSP explicitly (maybe on purpose to avoid to get caught) but they talk about it inside and again, seems to imply that it got the files... I always wanted to buy one book to see if they really put them on it but always skipped any of them.  I just wanted to fix my psp someday to play homebrew code again only. I don't care about pirating games, it's not my thing but I gave up to do that for now.  It's always good to have a nes emulator on the go. Yes, you can do it on the DS but I like to see the content with no missing raster and the DS memory cards have a tendency to fail easily.
<br />
<br />I may buy one of those emulator book someday out of curiosity. They usually sell them for 1300 yen. That quite expensive for Japan. It always come with a CD with it. But most of those book talk about emulators not for the homebrew reason: they talk about it to explain how to play back illegal games on your computer.

When you can get Weekly jump for less than 3$ every week and it's quite a brick (ok.. the paper quality is low but still), or comic books for 4$, magazines for a few dollars etc. this book feel expensive. It should be more 7$ or less for what it offer.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">peppers wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">Why buy a book when up to date information is so easy to come by off the internet, when anything found in a book will be dated and incomplete.</div>
<br />
<br />Maybe because some people cannot read english? <img src="./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" />  Don't forget that fact. That book explain about emulator, where to get etc. I'm sure that book is just an update of something they already made in the past with a few thing extra thought.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I'm not saying that there is none (it's not like I searched a lot on the subject) but it doesn't seems as common as english one.  How many of the emulators we know comes from Japan except from Ootake (PCE but actually he continued an existing one) and Virtuanes?  Most well known emulators are english one in general. 
<br />
<br />And from the look of it, this book target audience is for people that doesn't know about emulators, so why would they search on the net about that in the first place? That seems pretty obvious to me. So you go to the bookstore in the game section and you see that new book about エミュレターand you wonder "what the heck is that".  I think there is nothing wrong to spread the word about them. You cannot search on the subject if you don't know about it.  For us, that's pretty useless I guess except for being a strange collector item if you don't live in japan <img src="./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" />
