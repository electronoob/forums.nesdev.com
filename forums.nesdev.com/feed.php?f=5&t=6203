It is a really good emulator, I thought the compatibility seemed better than most other emulators at the time.  We had it on the same TV as the NES and they looked the same (a little better actually, because the NES was an NES2 with bars on the video).  Now I know why. <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />Pretty much it did everything I wanted it to do in the last version, so I don't think I had any feature requests but I do remember emailing you because I was working on my old NES sound emulator for SNES and was curious if the SPU was anything like the SPC.  It probably was just that there's no easy way around the interpolation for both of them, heh.<br /><br />Myself, I haven't had a working PSX in years.  I have 6 non-working systems now, all different revisions so I can't even make a frankenstein.  It's cool when it works, but it's literally a pile of junk.  Also likely that I just have all the abused ones, because they were free, heheh.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=10">Memblers</a> — Tue Mar 23, 2010 1:02 pm</p><hr />
