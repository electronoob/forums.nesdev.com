They only ignore one of the scroll axes though as far as I know, so this means they're only useful for games that scroll in a single direction (on the other hand, this probably would have helped with the NES <em>a lot</em> if it had that feature...)<br /><br />As for the Game Gear, well, remember it's basically just the center of the Master System window, so basically those two features end up off-screen and become useless. At least it has the sprite scaling bug fixed (which is why Virtua Fighter Mini takes advantage of it).

This games was ported to the Master System though (by TecToy, probably), wasn't it? What about Earthworm Jim on the SMS, which uses scaled sprites for its status bar? Do those games fail when played on certain SMS consoles?

Since they don't have any vertical details, they can be drawn taller than they need to be and only a section of each is displayed with raster effects. They always start and end at the same screen positions, but the actual tiles are scrolling vertically, which can't be noticed because there are no vertical details.<br /><br />The same concept could probably be used for more complex status bars, if you used symbols instead of words to indicate what's being measured, and bars, squares, sticks, or anything else without vertical details to measure/count stuff.

Why didn't they leave it as MAG in mode 4 is anyone's guess, they were probably making up space in the die (every other SMS2 improvement is retained as far as I know).<br /><br />EDIT: oh also I just remembered, all PAL systems use the SMS2 VDP, so in theory PAL-only games don't have to worry about the scaling bug.

It's still possible that the consoles released by TecToy had the more recent VDP though, considering that since they only started making consoles a few years after it had already been released in other regions.

But on other places it was a safe bet, to the point that Codemasters would always use the 224 height resolution instead of the 192 one (I wonder if they were even aware that the 224 one wasn't present in all consoles).<br /><br />But yeah, it's likely that TecToy's systems were using the fixed VDP. I'm not sure if they were using PAL-M though (Brazil is next to a PAL-N territory after all, many TVs were NTSC + PAL-N + PAL-M compatible, and they also sold consoles in Argentina which is a PAL-N territory).
