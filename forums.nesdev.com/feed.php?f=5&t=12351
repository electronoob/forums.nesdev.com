Oh yeah. Well, the framebuffer area still hasn't changed though. You can DMA 14,233 bytes in a frame, and the frame buffer is 31,104 bytes, so you can almost have the game run at 30fps. I personally would settle for a lower frame rate and resolution for having about 16x the amount of color.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=6683">Espozo</a> — Sat Feb 07, 2015 10:51 pm</p><hr />

In other words, the &quot;Xbox piped into a TV tuner&quot; solution. Video memory bandwidth would be the limiting factor there.<br /><br />On the other hand, newer games are framed for 16:9. You could have the game render to 256x176 and letterbox the crap out of it. This gives (262-176)*331/2 = over 14000 bytes per frame. At 4bpp, the entire frame is 256*176*4/8=22528 bytes, enough to double buffer a whole 4bpp plane at 30 fps.
