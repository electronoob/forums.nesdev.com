<br />
<br />I have a (hopefully) quick question about the color palette.  Before I was 
<br />only using 4 colors and it worked out with my background fairly decent.  
<br />Now I've increased the color palette to 8.  However, my background is
<br />still only using the first 4 colors and I was wondering how do you get it
<br />to "map" (or use) some of the other colors?  Is this where attribute tables 
<br />come in??
<br />
<br />Thanks.

That helps some.  I also read the NESTechFAQ by Chris Covell.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">The NES' background palette has 16 entries in it, with some mirroring going on. But a tile in the name table can't access all 16 colours at once; it can only be made up of 4 colours from the total palette of 16. This is just a limitation imposed by Nintendo. So, the attribute table comes in and describes which 4 of the 16 colours in the palette a certain tile will take. Because the attribute table is of such a small size (64 bytes), it only has a resolution of 2 tiles x 2 tiles. So, each 16x16 pixel area on the background has to share the same 4 colours.</div>
<br />
<br />I understand what he's saying here but I'm just not too sure about 
<br />how to implement it?  
<br />
<br />Thanks.

<br />
<br />Use a palette index (possible numbers are just 0 through 3).  It's kind of a pain to work with.  Normally I've kept a copy of the attribute table in the CPU's RAM, because you have to modify it 2 bits at a time, and reading $2006 is a waste of vblank time IMHO.
<br />
<br />The attribute coordinates are maximum of 16 X and 15 Y.
<br />
<br />To change the attrib block at 0,0 to palette set #1, you'd write (binary) %xxxxxx01 to $23C0 (where X means whatever bits were there before).  And %xxxx01xx for coords 1,0, %xx01xxxx for 0,1, %01xxxxxx for 1,1.  That's the pattern to follow.
<br />
<br />I'd say you could look at or use the code I wrote that handles nametable and attribute updates together, but it's a really ineffecient and crappy old mess.  But here it is anyways.  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /> 
<br />
<br />It's the first routine on there.  The label "attribute_table" is in CPU RAM.

<br />
<br />Memblers .. thanks for your help.  I've reviewed your source code.  I have 
<br />to say I haven't done much with bit shifting yet.  So I was a little bit 
<br />confused as to what you were doing with the ASL before the attribute_table
<br />stuff.  Also, where you said "X means whatever bits where there before".
<br />What do you mean by that.  In your code you have 1s but if I haven't set
<br />anything before then would they just be 0s?  I'm gonna keep going over
<br />it and re-re-re-read the stuff about attribute tables.  But those where the
<br />questions that just stood out to me now.

<br />It's a read-modify-write. For example, to change the lower-right attribute in an byte, you have to read the attribute byte (from VRAM or from RAM), modify only the upper bits, and write it back.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Yeah, working with the attribute tables is a bitch. And you will need to learn how to use the SHIFTs, the ANDs and the ORs, as you'll need to manipulate individual bits in a byte.
<br />
<br />Working with the name tables is easy, since 1 byte = 1 tile. So, unless you're willing to set up the colors of an area of 4x4 tiles at a time, you'll have to learn how to work with bits. Some games actually do update a 4x4 tile area at a time, to avoid complexity.
<br />
<br />But if you're looking into changing the color of a random block in the middle of the screen, you'll have to take the attribute byte for that location, change the respective bits and write back. But we don't like to waste VBlank time reading and modifying stuff, so we keep a copy of the attribute tables in RAM, where we do all the dirty work, and just copy from there to the atribute tables during VBlank.
<br />
<br />As Memblers said, the first attribute table starts at $23C0. The byte at that location will define the palettes used by the tiles at positions 0, 1, 2, 3, 32, 33, 34, 35, 64, 65, 66, 67, 96, 97, 98 and 99. That's 16 tiles, a 4x4 square at the top left corner of the screen. The first 2 bits of the attribute byte define the palette used by tiles at positions 0, 1, 32 and 33. The next 2 bits are the palette index for tiles 2, 3, 34 and 35. And so on.
<br />
<br />So, if you want to set the palette for tiles 0, 1, 32 and 33, youd just set the lower 2 bits of the attribute byte to the palette you want to use. Since you're learning, you could just try setting these 2 bits to whatever you want and set all others to 0, so you can see the results. If you KNOW exactly what you want to show, you can just hard code the values you write to the attribute table. The read-modify-write is for dynamic games, that draw their graphics based on 16x16 pixel blocks, mostly.
<br />
<br />Since you're used to have all 0's in the attribute tables, try setting a few of the bits to point to adifferent palette and you'll soon understand how it works, by seeing the results on screen.

<br />I really hate to ask this but could you give me a mini code example.

<br />
<br />The latch is a 1-bit PPU value that decides between a high and low byte write. If the latch is not set then the next write to $2006 will be to the upper byte (i.e. $xx00). If it is set then the next write will be to the lower byte (i.e. $00xx).
