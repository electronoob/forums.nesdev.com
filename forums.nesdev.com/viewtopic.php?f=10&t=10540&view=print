		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />If you want any sort of performance out of a Game Boy to NES port, it'd likely take a line-by-line rewrite due to how different the design principles are between the 8080 family and 6502 family. There are also plenty of graphical features that the Game Boy has but the NES PPU lacks, which a game might have to make up for using advanced mapper features. Nintendo has these resources to make <em>Super Mario Bros. Deluxe</em>, but a hobbyist might not.<br /><br />GBA to SNES? That'd be like trying to go from SNES with Super FX to SNES without Super FX.

The sound engine would need a complete rewrite, but a lot of the video stuff translates fairly straightforwardly.<br /><br />NES to GBA and SNES to GBA have been done in homebrew emulators.

I think Mario Bros. (not Super) was one of them. The fact that the 65816 can run 6502 code natively probably helps a lot.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />The feasibility of a game to be ported from one platform to another is entirely dependent on the game itself. For example, Tetris can run on most anything, but Mario 64 would probably require a platform capable of 3D graphics.<br /><br />Obviously, special features for the platform will need to be taken into account, but I honestly don't think Chrono Trigger will <em>explode</em> if the fancy graphical effects for spells and the like aren't present.
