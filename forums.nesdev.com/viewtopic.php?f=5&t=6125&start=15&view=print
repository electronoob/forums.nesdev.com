I would have to play them again to make a better comparison. The only one I do remember well is MM/MM2/MM9. The other ones, they never left any good impression for me.
<br />
<br />So from my point of view, I would say that it closer to MM6 since it felt rushed with nothing original.
<br />
<br />edit:
<br />
<br />At the least, it cost only 10$ so it's not so bad compared to long time ago when we had to play 60$ and more for something that was not so great in the end.

<br />Oh,And music from trailer if fine with me,also while showing "Easy mode" was pretty good.
<br />About weapons:They are hopeless,maybe 1 or 2 of then is "nice",but overall they are nothing compared to those from past.
<br />BUt,there's a plus-you can play as Protoman(Hey,it's no spoiler,it was in trailer...).
<br />Stages are built very nicely.(Can't say why-spoilers)
<br />Overall i can give 8,5/10 points for Megaman10.
<br />Maybe 9/10 if I have good mood...

<br />
<br />- So, I bought a Wii last night. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /> And could buy Wii points using my credit card, something MUCH easier than the X360 XBLA account system. So, I'm very happy!
<br />
<br />- Regarding the game, my opinion is exactly the oppositive of Banshaku. The music, indeed, has no reminds of previous games, though, it's much original and makes justice to a new MegaMan game style. It's awesome. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /> As a retro player, I have my own way of enjoying a game - I defeated 5 robot masters, and I stopped. The learning curve is higher than in MM9, but it's very fun and addictive. ^_^;;
<br />
<br />- The Wii itself is a great system. Most of bigger and hottest titles in modern graphics don't make justice on it, but its options are awesome.

<br />Due to child labor laws, mowing neighbors' lawns is pretty much the only way a child can earn money over the summer to buy toys. And even then, a child has to pay cash for things, not use a credit/debit card. That's one reason why iTunes gift cards and Nintendo Points cards exist.

<br />
<br />Maybe not a fanboy as the derogatory term but you must really, really like Mega man if you were ready to buy another console even though in Brazil there is all those insane taxes so you can have it 15 days earlier <img src="./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" />  It must have a little bit of impact on how much you like #10 since you had to invest so much just to play it earlier.
<br />
<br />@Tokumaru:
<br />
<br />It depends what kind of fan you're talking to. The one closer to fanboy will always find something good about things even thought there is many flaw (see Mac zealots in general, not normal Mac users).  As for Sonic, they really run that series down into the ground and I'm not expecting much from #4 too.

<br />
<br />- I don't remember of having the same impulsive thing when MM9 was released; from what I remember, "the day has arrived, I almost forgot" was in my mind that day. No clue about my MM10 wish to play... odd. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />
<br />
<br />- Anyway, the Wii was double-priced (+ a bit more) in 2008. Now, it has an accessible price. It was worth the effort after all.
