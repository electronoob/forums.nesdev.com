<br />
<br />
<br />I'm currently working on a single level smb style demo to try to understand nesdev so that one day I might be able to take this noob hat off.  My road block now deals with scrolling and a static status bar.  Currently my entire screen (including the status bar) scrolls when the player moves.  The status bar is at the top of the screen and I'm not using any memory mappers (as I don't know enough about them yet).  I spoke briefly with Memblers about it and he gave me a little bit of direction ... suggesting to me to use sprite #0 hit.  I understand the whole sprite #0 feature and how to read it ... just not sure where to go in stopping the very top part of the screen from scrolling.  Any information, documentation links, and suggestions would greatly be appreciated.  I'll put my noob cap back on and sit in the corner now.  Thanks.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Okay, I had this problem before, but I think I can help you. What you need to do is make sprite #0 be at least 1 colored pixel, because if there's no pixel, the hit will never read. Well anyways, you'd want to make the sprites y coord line up with where you want the scroll to stop. But you have to make sure that a pixel in sprite #0 is colliding with a solid background pixel, and not just the first color of every pallete.
<br />
<br /> You'd want to restore the scroll at the beggining of every NMI. You'd probably want to keep the scroll location of the level in some variable, and store that into the scroll after every hit. I don't know how your code works, so I don't know what you plan to do. But restore the scroll at the beggining of every NMI. Then wait for a sprite #0 hit. After the hit, do what you want with the scroll. But just remember to restore the scroll, it's what stops the status bar from scrolling.
<br />
<br />And make sure that sprite #0 hits with a solid background pixel! Otherwise, it will wait forever and ever and ever in your NMI! Do you understand how to do this?

<br />Thanks for the reply.  I'm not sure what exactly youre saying here.  Here is a cryptic drawing
<br />
<br />of what my screen looks like:
<br />
<br />
<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">|----------------------------------------|<br />|&nbsp; &nbsp; status bar<br />|----------------------------------------|&nbsp; &nbsp;&lt;--- ceiling tiles<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br /><br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;O&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &lt; -- weak guy drawing<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;/\<br />|----------------------------------------|&nbsp; &nbsp;&lt; -- ground<br /><br /></div>
<br />
<br />sprite 0 would be in the top left of his face right now.  So you're saying line up Y with what??

<br /><img src="http://pics.pineight.com/nes/emu_or_video1_256.png" alt="Image" />
<br />
<br />First off, change your demo so that the end of vblank code scrolls the screen to (0, 0). In this state, without scrolling, make sure that a non-transparent pixel of the status bar overlaps a non-transparent part of sprite 0; <em>Super Mario Bros.</em> uses part of the coin image for that.
<br />
<br />Then wait for sprite 0 with a bit $2002 bvc loop, and when it finishes, scroll the screen by writing once to $2000 (select nametable, etc.) and once to $2005 (to set the horizontal scroll), and then read $2002 (to reset the first/second byte latch used by $2005 and $2006).

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Oh, that can't happen if you're going to use sprite #0 hits. Move the sprites that make up the character to different sprite numbers, so if this is your sprite:
<br />
<br />0 1
<br />2 3
<br />4 5
<br />
<br />make it:
<br />
<br />1 2
<br />3 4
<br />5 6
<br />
<br />Because sprite 0 has to be up by where the status bar ends. like this:
<br />
<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">-------------------------------------------<br />&nbsp;Status Bar<br />-------------------------------------------<br />&nbsp;0<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Sprite<br />_______________________________<br /><br /></div>
<br />
<br />See where the 0 is? That's where you want sprite #0 to be. Because what you are doing is every frame, you restore the scroll to #$00 until the PPU detects sprite #0 hitting a solid background pixel. When the PPU detects sprite #0, you can then update the scroll if your character is moving, or whatever you want to do scrolling-wise that doesn't involve the status bar. But make sure that a pixel in sprite #0 hits a solid pixel on the status bar. What you are doing is kind of an advanced thing, but if you really think about what you're doing, you can figure it out.
<br />
<br /> Just line up the solid sprite pixel with a solid background pixel on the status bar, and leave the scroll set to #$00 until the PPU detects that a solid sprite pixel and a solid background pixel are coliding. Is that a little more helpful.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />If your level is scrolling only horizontally, is is really really easy.
<br />If so, you'll most likely be using vertical mirroring
<br />Keep your status bar in nametable zero (for example). Your level data will change from nametable zero and 1 while scrolling, and the scroll value will change. But, at the end of VBlank, always write your scrolls so the bar show up (so, write $00, $00 to $2005 and anything with bit 0 clear to $2000).
<br />Then wait for sprite-zero hit. You can perfor your hit easily since the status bar won't moove, find a trick to hide the sprite.
<br />Then, once it's hit, write your new horizontal scroll to $2005 (only one write is necesary, the second one won't affect scrolling if there is any), and write the proper nametable selection bit to $2000.
<br />If scrolling verticaly, look at Brad Taylor's PPU adressing doc to know how to merge $2006 and $2005 writes to scroll vertically.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Thanks for all the replies.  I think I pretty much have a handle on what everyone is trying to say here.  I've moved my sprite 0 to the top and aligned it with where I want my scroll to stop.  I've setup a bvc loop looking for the sprite 0 hit.   Where my problem comes in, I think, is with scrolling (sadly).  I think my problem comes in with the way I've done my past scrolling.
<br />
<br />Here is what I've come up with.  All my logic is done in NMI.  Here it is:
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">nmi:<br /><br /><br /><br />&nbsp;lda #%10001000<br /><br />&nbsp;sta $2000<br /><br />&nbsp;lda scrollPos<br /><br />&nbsp;ldx #$00<br /><br />&nbsp;sta $2005&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />&nbsp;stx $2005&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />&nbsp;jsr dmatrans&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <br /><br />&nbsp;jsr controlStrobe&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <br /><br />&nbsp;jsr sprite_hit&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br /><br />sprite_hit:<br /><br />&nbsp;bit $2002<br /><br />&nbsp;bvc sprite_hit<br /><br />&nbsp;lda scrollPos<br />&nbsp;sta $2005<br />&nbsp;lda $2002<br />&nbsp;rts<br /><br /></div>
<br />
<br />I think my problem is (and please correct me if Im wrong) the way I've been executing my scroll.  What I have been doing is using scrollPos to store the value of my scroll position.  When the user presses left or right the background scrolled and sprites legs moved giving the appearance that the sprite was actually moving through the scene (and scrollPos is either inc or  dec based on direction).  If I understood correctly (tepples) what you were saying ... I need to write $00 to 2005 at the beginning of my nmi routine (which currently writes scrollPos to the horz and 00 to vertical).  If I do that then the sprite doesnt move at all.  So I guess my question is ... how does one <strong>correctly</strong> make the sprite "walk".  Also, would the rest of above be correctly if the scroll parts were right?
<br />
<br />Any good docs on this whole scrolling thing would be good if you could reference me to them.
<br />
<br />Thanks again.

<br />
<br />The first time, you have to write the position of the status bar, wich most likely is 0, 0, in nametable 0, if you're doing as people said. This way, every time a frame starts, it will show your status bar. After the status bar is over, the sprite hit will happen and <strong>only then</strong> you want to write your scrollPos to $2005.
<br />
<br />As for the sprite moving, I guess you already know the scroll values only affect the background, for any movement of the sprites you have to update their individual X and Y positions.
<br />
<br />EDIT: You said the background didn't move at all when you changed the first write to $2005 to 0. You changed only the first write, right? If you changed all writes to 0 there is no way anything will scroll. After the hit you have to write <strong>scrollPos</strong>.

<br />Documents usually cover the actual tech aspects of the console, they hardly ever explain any "tricks" that are actually used in game making. For this kind of info you'll pretty much have to ask around, or look for a place where someone has already asked about it.
<br />
<br />I decided to write this in another post because I think many people run into this kind of problem. If you don't know squat about game programming, you'll have 2 barriers when learning NES programming: you have to learn how the system works and then learn how a game works.
<br />
<br />I made a few games before I got into NES programming, so it wasn't quite lost, but many people have no idea of how to start coding an engine. Many don't even know what an engine is, with all the point-and-click/object-oriented/visual crap of nowadays.
<br />
<br />Well, I'm saying this because maybe there should be some links related to actual game programming concepts avaliable to NES programmers somewhere. Not that the status bar is a very good example of it, it just reminded me of the subject. That's it.

<br />Ive messed around with some  game programming using C and OpenGL.  This is about my second month in nesdev....    I've seen somethings on the web ... but its very very basic stuff ... haven't found anything like the stuff you guys talk about here.  I do use the docs on nesdev.com.
