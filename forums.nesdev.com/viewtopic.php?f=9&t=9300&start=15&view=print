		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Here is a simpler idea (one which I have thought of the discrete logic required; still a bit complicated compared to other discrete logic but simpler than what I wrote at first).<br /><br />Video:<ul><li>There is 16K CHR RAM on the cartridge.</li><li>The PPU's internal VRAM is not used.</li><li>Some of the address lines of the CHR RAM chip is controlled by a register on the cartridge.</li><li>If CHR A6, CHR A7, CHR A8, CHR A9, and CHR A13 are high, then instead of using the address requested by the PPU, use the same address as the previous access (stored in the register) but set bit12 of the RAM chip address, and store the XOR of CHR A10 and CHR A11 in another bit of the register.</li><li>If CHR A13 is low, the stored XOR of the register is XORed with the PPU's request and used for bit12 of the RAM chip address.</li><li><em>Optional feature:</em> Dual-ported CHR RAM, mapped to CPU $4000-$7FFF (but $4000-$4017 is not used; reading/writing CHR RAM $0000-$0017 can only be done by the PPU).</li><li><em>Optional feature:</em> Two 16K CHR RAMs, one mapped to CPU as above and the other to PPU, swappable by a register.</li></ul>(I think this allows you to have 8x8 attributes, and a status area using a different pattern table.)<br /><br />Audio:<ul><li>Audio out clocks a 4-bit binary counter. (Is it allowed for the audio out to clock anything?)</li><li>The four bits of output are connected to AND gates with the other inputs connected to a register, which in turn are connected to a digital to analog converter.</li><li>The digital to analog converter output is mixed with the 2A03 audio.</li></ul>(It might be able to do some special effects, including square waves and saw waves.)<br /><br />Bankswitching:<ul><li>Writing anywhere in $8000-$FFFF selects a 32K PRG ROM bank.</li><li>There may be 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, or 256 banks; only these bits are used and the others are ignored. (If there is only 1 bank, all the bits are ignored and only the address is used.)</li><li>The low four bits of the address write the register for the AND gates for audio.</li><li><em>Optional feature:</em> If two 16K CHR RAMs are used, bit4 of the address selects which one is accessed by PPU (the other is accessed by CPU).</li></ul>(This seem a simple way of PRG ROM banking.)

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />If I ever to make cartridges, they will always be 60-pins cartridges (so that I can use audio, and don't have to deal with CIC); an adapter can be used if you want it to run on a 72-pins system. In addition, all of them will work with NTSC, although some might work with PAL as well (I think PAL systems (other than Dendy, perhaps?) are always 72-pins, but using an adapter you connect it to NTSC and PAL).
