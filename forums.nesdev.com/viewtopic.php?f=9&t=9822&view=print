You need to salvage the CPU and PPU obviously but the end result is pretty impressive. I wouldn't mind getting one if it wasn't so expensive. 100$ just for the pcb. He has 2 version, one for regular composite PPU and one for RGB PPU (salvaged from arcade board). He was selling fully assembled console on ebay but apparently that ebay started closing his auction. He was selling them for crazy amount, close to 500$.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.atariage.com/forums/topic/203257-nes-super-8-project/" class="postlink">http://www.atariage.com/forums/topic/203257-nes-super-8-project/</a>

You're stealing the CPU and PPU from a working NES console and those are pretty much the only two components that matter anyway. It would be different if we were talking about a new board with the CPU and PPU cloned in a FPGA or something.

And considering the proposed price, it's not worth it.  Hmm, let's see, US$500 for this nonsense vs. US$135 for a PowerPak.  The US economy is booming, as you know, lots of people have all sorts of cash just falling out of their pockets, we all have so much money we don't know what to do with it... *blink blink*

This could also make the system even smaller (considering you could squeeze the PPU and CPU on a single FPGA).

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Many FPGA comes with about 16k of internal SRAM, while only 2k + 2k is needed.<br /><br />Then, level shifting must be done for CPU and PPU control, data and address lines. For single directional signals, this is not a very complex thing to do, and just requires a +5V supply and a couple of transistors per line. For the data lines, which are bi-directional, it could be a potential problem though. Fortunately we have access to the R/W signal (CPU)  or /RD and /WR signal (PPU), and then it is possible to have two level shifters (one for each direction) and only activate the necessarily one.

How is it lower considering it uses the original chips? A modern power supply? You could mod your existing system to use a modern power supply if you just can't live with the massive 10 watts of power your standard NES-001 unit draws. To compare my SNES also draws 10 watts. My Xbox 360 draws around 100 watts. So how many watts does this use? Is it could to cut it down from 10 to... what? I can't say I care about 10 watts already.<br />4. Better picture quality... how? It's the same PPU which is generating the video signal. Is he claiming his supporting circuitry, an amplifier or whatever gives better picture quality? I have no complaints about my picture quality on my NES-001 unit. And salvaging RGB PPUs results in wrong colors. <br /><br />So I see no gains. I suppose it might have both 72 and 60 pin connectors right? That would be a plus. Though it would have an incorrect 2.54mm pitch 72 pin connector I believe. I'm not trying to be mean, I just really don't see the point. What would be amazing is an accurate recreation of the NES (CPU and PPU) in a modern well produced FPGA and a board/console of that produced.<br /><br />For the guy that designed it, it's a neat project. But from the point of view of making a bunch of these, that's where I don't see the point.

I've experienced itches like this where it seems minor, but I'll go to great lengths to fix it.<br /><br />As for the selling price of early revisions, some people might really value having one-of-a-kind prototypes like this, perhaps seeing hardware hackers as celebrities of sorts. If someone wants to pay that much more power to them and this guy who's selling it.<br /><br />As for money raining from the sky, Ben Bernanke would like that, and the Fed is pouring lots of money into some place, which some people have a connection to. There seems no deficit in Earthbound SNES sales for crazy prices, for example.
