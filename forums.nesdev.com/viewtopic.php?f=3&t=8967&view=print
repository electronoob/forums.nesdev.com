<br />With sprites and BG at $0000 you'd expect they just disabled IRQs.  What are they using them for?

<br />It's also Acclaim's version of the MMC3.  I've yet to see good documentation proving there are no actual differences between the MC-ACC and the MMC3.  I wouldn't be surprised if differences in this non-normal mode are undocumented, I haven't looked very hard though...

<br /><strong>You're right</strong>, news to me. Now the game displays the scorebar at bottom. It's flickering when Mickey goes up, but it's a matter of adjusting the IRQs. Thanks.
<br />
<br />EDIT: one last thing... Is the IRQ allowed to clock when the PPU is <strong>not</strong> rendering, even if manipulating $2006/7?
<br />
<br /><span style="font-size: 75%; line-height: normal">*rendering = background or sprites are enabled, plus the scanline is between 0 and 239.</span>

<br />
<br />MSiL does a lot of $2006 writes during the VBlank. It messes up the counter, since it's clocked multiple times in a scanline. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" alt=":-(" title="Sad" />

<br />
<br />I constantly ran into these types of issues prior to implementing accurate MMC3 behavior.  And by that, I mean solely clocking based on A12, rather than trying to implement logic to determine if it should be clocked.  In other words, MMC3 should see every PPU read/write, and you need to accurately emulate PPU memory access/timing.

<br />No rule at all.  That's kind of my point -- MMC3 doesn't know anything about a vblank period (or any other external state).  You need to reduce the clocking logic to simply 'clock the counter if A12 went high after being low for x cpu cycles'.

<br />
<br />Yes that's the key.  CHR A12 must be low for ~X CPU cycles before the next rising edge is allowed to clock the counter.  I use 5 cycles in hardware and it seems to work.  I've heard of emus using 4-6, but I suppose that is due to subtle timing inaccuracies.

<br />
<br />When the PPU is rendering the BG, it makes two nametable accesses ($2xxx), and then two pattern table accesses ($0xxx ideally), for each tile, so A12 stays low for the whole time.
<br />
<br />When the PPU is fetching the sprite patterns, it makes two garbage nametable accesses ($2xxx again), and then two pattern table accesses ($1xxx ideally). This means, A12 is constantly toggling high and low!
<br />
<br />Each of the PPU's memory fetches take two pixels to complete, so the MMC3 must be able to ignore the 4 pixels of A12 being low while it makes the garbage nametable accesses. I'd say the MMC3 must be able to ignore a <em>minimum</em> of 5 pixels (or 1.667 CPU cycles) before the next rising edge of A12 can clock the scanline counter.
<br />
<br />That's the absolute bare minimum; the MMC3 probably waits a lot longer than just that. An easy way to test this with an authentic MMC3 is to set up a scenario using 8x16 sprite mode, with the BG using pattern table $0000. Put sprites 0-7 on the same Y-position together, give sprites 0 and 7 a pattern from $1000, with the others using a pattern from $0000. If the counter still functions normally, then the MMC3 is ignoring at least 53 pixels (17.667 CPU cycles).
<br />
<br />If this disrupts the scanline counter, then the effect will be the counter being clocked twice per scanline. Try having sprites 1 and 7 use the pattern from $1000 (MMC3 ignoring 45 pixels?), then sprites 2 and 7 (ignoring 37 pixels?), then 3 and 7 (ignoring 29 pixels?), and so on until the scanline counter starts behaving normally again.

This way, there's no CHR address for watching A12, but only loopy_v. Plus, I have to predict where a A12 should rise. It's pretty much like a timestamp system. Sorry.
