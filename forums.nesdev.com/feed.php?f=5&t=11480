True, Shiru's games have a distinct visual style that doesn't quite mesh with the prevailing design norms of the mid- to late 1980s. But at this point we have to tread carefully to avoid &quot;no true Scotsman&quot; fallacies. As I understand the consensus, though LJN is bad, it's still better than Color Dreams, and Color Dreams is better than Active Enterprises. (There were some Color Dreams games I enjoyed, but that's beside the point.) I'll take any style as long as it's no worse than LJN.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">Bregalad wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"><br />Also you'd never EVER have a non 8x8 font in <em>any </em>game.<br /></div><br />Plenty of NES games use 8x16 for short strings, and Snake Rattle n Roll uses 16x16.

I think it depends on what you mean by &quot;polished&quot;.<br /><br />Back then, developers would rather have a scrolling screen with bad graphics than a still screen with better graphics, because scrolling was considered awesome back then. Also you'd never EVER have a non 8x8 font in <em>any </em>game. That's this kind of stuff I mean. Don't get me wrong, this is nice and all, but it doesn't feel &quot;NES&quot; like philosophically.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=38">Bregalad</a> — Wed Aug 06, 2014 1:21 am</p><hr />
