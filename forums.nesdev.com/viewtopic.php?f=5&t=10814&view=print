I bet there are examples of glitchy behavior on the SNES and Genesis when they are trying to do things they weren't supposed to. I'll see if I can think of anything when I'm on my PC.<br /><br />Still, most of the NES glitches could have been avoided if developers had spent a little more time adjusting the timing of various effects and polishing their engines, but time and money constraints must have prevented that.

But it wasn't all that noticeable until Super Game Boy allowed looking at things through a screen other than a slow-ass LCD.<br /><br />So Atari 2600 (comb, and flicker in ports of games from more powerful systems), ZX Spectrum and Apple II (attribute clash), NES (attribute wrapping and scroll split mistiming), and Saturn/PS1 (polygon popup and no perspective correct texture mapping).

They also use sprite flicker to allow Sonic's sprite to be visible with the water sprites still covering the entire screen width. Pause the game, and rather than flickering, the game switches to 320px worth of water sprites, and if you put Sonic on the same scanlines, you'll notice he disappears on the same lines as the water.<br /><br />Plus, there are always the infamous color dots in the bottom border that are seen in many games at the point where they rewrite the palette for the next frame. Note that the capture is old and crappy, from before I acquired a composite cable. NTSC console referenced, not sure about the dots on PAL. I know there are others here who might know, however <img src="./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" /><br /><br /><img src="http://www.mdscene.net/user/~localh/md/ntsccaps/title.jpg" alt="Image" />

Over the years developers have gotten lazy with badly written engines (Crysis) and their 'we've got the money so who cares if its bugged' (Assassin's Creed). All because PCs are so powerful nowadays they can slack off.

I don't think that's a hardware issue though, just a silly programming mistake.<br /><br />I maintain my opinion that most of these glitches can be avoided with careful programming, but not everyone is willing to apply the extra effort, be it for time/money constraints, laziness or even ignorance.

And since often times you can't optimize GPU code much more than what most people know, how the hell is Crysis badly programmed?

Another is using primitives other than triangle/quad strips; I've read that GPUs aren't so efficient at handling fans and isolated triangles. Yet another is overly complex shaders.

Sadly, they toned down Crysis 2 so much it was nothing more than a console FPS.
