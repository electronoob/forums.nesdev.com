<br />I just got it to run super mario bros 3....
<br />The code works fine but the graphics are garbled... there is some odd problem with the CHR side.. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" />

<br />What is that huge thing?  A cap, a battery?  Also, what is that little socket for?  A lockout chip?  It looks like there is plenty of room for lockout chip holes, especially if you increase the size of the PCB.  That way people could solder in their own lockout chip if they wanted.  I'd say, start selling PCBs, construction directions, and the CPLD code the second you get MMC3 support working.  I can't wait to play with such a device!  For many people MMC3 support with future support for other mappers would be enough to buy a PCB immediately.
<br />
<br />Also, how do you do that surface mount soldering of the CPLD?

<br />
<br />The huge thing is a 100V 100uF cap... Couldn't find a physically smaller from my junkbox... The little socket is for DS1210 chip that handles the battery backup. The final PCB will have solder pads for a lockout chip if someone wants to wire-wrap one. The graphics work now 100%... IRQs still have some probs.

Converting that info into a &lt;B style="color:black;background-color:#A0FFFF"&gt;schematic&lt;/B&gt; is pretty easy, just need a good way to verify the design.  I think I can probably test the mappers independently of everything else, which will help give me confidence it will work when I put it all together.  I'll just remove the MMC chip from some cart, wire in my test implementation from the FPGA and plug it into the NES.  I just have to pick a game that uses most of the functionality of the MMC, because I don't want to have to do that too many times!</div>

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />What kind of battery does the NV-SRAM use?  Might I suggest designing the PCB with a coin holder in mind?  Motherboards do it and I typically don't keep them around long enough to change the battery... but my NES carts... they are kept long enough that battery replacement is necessary.
<br />
<br />Is game transfer still really slow?  Would you consider selling pre-built kits?  You could make more money if you could get price breaks on the ICs... and you could obviously charge for the difficulty of soldering that CPLD.
