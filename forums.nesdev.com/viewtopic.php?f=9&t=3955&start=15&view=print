		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Your rewiring description looks correct, and there's nothing obviously wrong. I assume you tested the patch in more reliable emulators (nestopia, nintendulator, bizhawk) or using a powerpak?<br /><br />Have you double-checked your wiring is making good connections? What kind of testing tools do you have access to? (oscilloscope, multimeter, logic tester, &amp;c)

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />The patch works in nestopia.  As for the wiring, I don't have any tools to test.  Im just meticulous with my soldering.  I have already done a mmc3 game that worked that I did without testing.  I have looked over the board and it seems fine but I will check with a multimeter.<br /><br />On the other hand it might even be the donor game.  For example I did an UNROM using a Konami UNROM (Skate or die).  I cleaned the game before modding and it never worked.  And the PRG chip kept heating up a lot, like a phone.  I've never seen this before in an nes game.  So I modded it anyway and it didn't work haha.<br /><br /><br /><br />FWIW, the donor game im using, Tecmo Baseball is the version 1 with the 12 code on the back.  When I opened it up tho, the CHR RAM chip was different than what was in the cart db.  It wasnt the SDIP chip described but a regular one.  I dont know why but maybe that has something to do with it?  Or the game was tampered before I picked it up?  I did test the game and it worked before I opened it up.

I'd suspect the /ROMSEL trace was broken somehow. Probably some of the other traces, too, given that it never worked.<br /><div class="quotetitle">guitarzombie wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">FWIW, the donor game im using, Tecmo Baseball is the version 1 with the 12 code on the back.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Thinking about it perhaps you're right about my Skate or Die! UNROM problem.  Because the game'll start up but it keeps flashing random colors.  Green, Blue, Purple, White etc.  I'll take another glance at it.<br /><br />As for my SGROM, well its still a mystery to me.  I thought i could get my hands on a multimeter and try to figure it out but looks like thats not the case.  All my connections look good and I re-did some of them too.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Well im an idiot.  Turns out that even tho I was right about Bionic Commando and got the right donor, the translated version actually uses WRAM.  <br /><br />So I found a bunch of SNROMs with no batteries that'll do that trick.  But im also guessing if I did get one with a battery it wouldn't make a difference anyway.<br /><br />Sorry for all the trouble!
