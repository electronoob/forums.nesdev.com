		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Hi guys, I'm wondering right now which would be the best approach to use for a demo I'm planning.
<br />I'm going to have just a tileset and draw some backgrounds as I press a key (no scroll at all).
<br />Just some sort of slideshow of pre-made backgrounds that all share the same tileset.
<br />
<br />Besides this, could you give me some advice on when to use each kind of CHR? Thanks in advance.
<br />
<br />PS: Oh, does anyone of you if SnowBro is still out there? He doesn't answer any of my emails and I
<br />don't know if he has the email adress I'm writing to anymore.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />CHR-ROM:
<br />GOOD:
<br />-easier to use (graphics are already there on power up);
<br />-fast and easy background animations through bankswitching;
<br />BAD:
<br />-size of switchable chunks limited by the mapper;
<br />-you must have everything you'll need pre-drawn;
<br />
<br />CHR-RAM:
<br />GOOD:
<br />-dynamic effects calculated at run-time;
<br />-you can manipulate any tile however you want;
<br />-you can compress the graphics (not really an advantage...);
<br />BAD:
<br />-although you can change them as you want, it's a slow process, wich makes changing many tiles at a time when inside a game impossible;
<br />
<br />Also, if you are going to put the game on a cart you must work with what you have. If you have a CHR-RAM cart, it is easier to just swap the PRG with your own. But CHR-RAM carts are not that common, are they?
<br />
<br />Well, if it's just a simple demo using only one tileset, I'd say go with CHR-ROM. The CHR file can just be appended to the PRG and you ready to use the graphics, you don't even need to code a routine that will upload the graphics, they'll just be hardcoded there.
<br />
<br />I tend to like CHR-ROM better, but I can admit that CHR-RAM has it's advantages. And it seems to be common that CHR-RAM is used in the Dev scene, maybe because it's easier to reprogram only 1 chip (PRG) instead of 2.

<br />
<br />Okay, It's pretty much what I had in mind. Right now I don't recalll any game using CHR-RAM... For all the projects I have in mind, CHR-ROM will be perfect. I don't have any tiles that need to be changed nor I have any effect to do in real-time.
<br />
<br />I think I will get deeper with the CHR-RAM issue... it's applications and such. If you can mention some CHR-RAM games and explain a little any effect that they have I'll be very pleased  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" />

<br />With CHR-RAM, I heard it's possible to update up to 16 tiles per frame using some tricks used by Battletoads.

I guess just not as many as the ones using CHR-ROM. some of the Megaman games use CHR-RAM. Megaman 1 for sure, and some later one too, 4 I think. If you play while watching the pattern tables you can see the tiles beeing redrawn little by little (not in Megaman 1, I think it uses the same tiles through the whole level).<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">For all the projects I have in mind, CHR-ROM will be perfect. I don't have any tiles that need to be changed nor I have any effect to do in real-time.</div><br />CHR-RAM has it's advantages, but it is so slow to update and that makes the advantages quite useless. You can change any tile in the pattern tables, but what use is that if you can only change 4 of them every frame, so that the rest of the game does not slow down? It may seem more tempting to use CHR-RAM on PAL systems, that have so much more Vblank time.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">I think I will get deeper with the CHR-RAM issue... it's applications and such. If you can mention some CHR-RAM games and explain a little any effect that they have I'll be very pleased  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /></div><br />I think some Final Fantsy game uses CHR-RAM to animate water tiles in real time.<br /><br />To me, CHR-ROM games look better, as CHR-RAM games tend to look a bit static (newer games... older ones were all kinda static). It allows for big background animations that are impossible to do with CHR-RAM. I can't think of a licenced game right now, but Somari, the pirate Sonic clone, animates (badly, but it does) the background, rings and stuff by switching CHR banks.<br /><br />Combine CHR switching with palette rotation and you can get some very nice effects. You need to be able to switch smal banks, or you'll be wasting CHR space with repeated data, though.<br /><br />But little of this matters for a simple demo of static images. Either will work OK, only CHR-ROM will be simpler to use.<br /><br />EDIT:<br /><div class="quotetitle">Dwedit wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">With CHR-RAM, I heard it's possible to update up to 16 tiles per frame using some tricks used by Battletoads.</div>
<br />Well, possible it is. You would need to copy 256 bytes in order to draw 16 tiles. The problem is that this is not the only thing you'll be doing in Vblank. You still have to update the name tables and attribute tables as the player moves, write palettes, do sprite OAM... Many other things need VBlank time, so you can't give it all to updating tiles. You could shut the screen off early, or turn it on late, to get more time, but then it gets pretty tricky...
<br />
<br />With CHR-ROM you could change 64 tiles, instead of 16, faster than you can blink. The problem is that 64 is the <strong>minimum</strong> ammount of tiles you can change, in the best case.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Megaman 1 does upload tiles during levels.
<br />And yeah, Megaman is a good comparaison between CHRAM and CHROM because even ones uses CHRAM and odd ones CHROM (with the exeption of the original, wich is CHRAM). Does Megaman 3 and 5 looks better than 4 and 6 ? I don't think so. There isn't THAT much difference. What I like with CHRAM is the ability to totally customize your tileset.
<br />If you're writing a small game (NROM or CNROM), you'll want to go with CHROM. If you're going for a larger game, it all depend of the mapper and of the graphic features you want. I don't think one is better than the other (while I kinda like CHRAM, hehe).

<br />However, Simon's Quest is ported from FDS and have CHROM, and on the other side Contra originally had CHROM in japan, and they simplified the card with CHRAM in the states.
<br />
<br />Batman - Return of the jocker has real great graphics, but the sprites are too big and this makes the game impossible to play. (game controls are horribly unresponding).
<br />
<br />I'd agree to consider Battletoads as the ultimate CHRAM exemple, but also consider Final Fantasy III.

<br />Not too tricky if you just turn the screen off early. <a href="http://pineight.com/nes/" class="postlink">Tetramino (homebrew)</a> does this for nametable updates. If you're considering developing a PAL-only game and accepting the PAL NES's inherent letterbox, then you could probably get away with turning off the screen way early and turning it on way late in the NTSC version.
