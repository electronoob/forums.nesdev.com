I need it to be $00 for the correct palette since I always update $0, $1 and $3 but never $2 of sprites. I know that all the excess sprites may appear at 0,0 depending on how the RAM is starts up, it doesn't matter. This is just a hacky program I will probably delete tomorrow, you guys are being way too serious about the small stuff that I already said doesn't matter and I'm very aware of.<br /><br />I now know that there isn't anything logically wrong with my program and that the clipping is just a quirk of the PPU. Nintendo could have done better but they didn't, and it's not something I can change by thinking about it, so I'll just have to move my square to the background and scroll that, no big deal.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=20">kyuusaku</a> — Fri Dec 14, 2007 6:39 am</p><hr />

What just happens is that there is NEVER negative coordinate on a sprite pos on the NES (at least not in hardware) so you cannot display part a sprite from the top or the left of the screen without tricks.<br />And yes OAM has to always be cleaned with any value between $f0-$ff for sprites you don't use, $00 isn't what you want. "Cleaning" the OAM with $00 will have the effect to supperpose 64 sprites using tile $00 and palette 0 at position 0,0. This is bad.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=38">Bregalad</a> — Fri Dec 14, 2007 6:05 am</p><hr />

Yes, but you're right, I recalled the behavior quite incorrectly. Much simpler than I thought, when $00 underflows, the sprite is at $FF which is valid, rest is clipped.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=20">kyuusaku</a> — Thu Dec 13, 2007 10:12 pm</p><hr />

I get the feeling that we're talking about two different things.

That's most likely why this feature is existing at all. In function of your game engine and scrolling workings, you'll want this area to be clipped or not (most games either always clips it or never clips it). Also you cannot rely to the leftmost&amp;rightmost 8 pixels to be rendered as far I've heard some monitors will hide this. If you use leftmost hardware clipping, a X coordinate of zero will completely hide the sprite and it will have no effect at all (exept to be counted in the 8 sprites per line limitation).<br /><br />When it comes to scroll smoothly vertically it's not too hard as most monitors and emulators will hide the topmost and bottommost 8 pixels, so this is just enough to scroll smoothly. If you want to do PAL coding or if you are using 8x16 sprites, this isn't true any longer. In both cases, leaving the rendering off ala Battletoads would be one solution, however scrolling becomes a pain in the ass.<br />What you can do is abuse the 8 sprites per line limitation and place 8 top-priorities sprites at Y coordinate 0. Then you just have to turn the BG (and BG only, not sprites) off via $2001 in order to get a black background on the top of invisible sprites, effectively blanking the area. You'd want to enable BG back at either scanline #9 (PAL) or scanliine #17 (8x16 sprites) for completely smooth movement. I guess the scrolling will be right because the sprites were left enabled technically. It that's not the case, you may consider bankwitching an all-blank CHRROM page for the top scanlines, ending with a similar effect.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=38">Bregalad</a> — Thu Dec 13, 2007 9:51 am</p><hr />

It's obvious to me when I look at it. In my game, I have portraits for each of the characters. There aren't enough colors in one attribute section to do shading, hair color, and whatnot. So I have to do sprite overlapping. When I first entered in all the values for the sprites, I had them all multiples of 8. They ended up being 1 pixel too low, so I had to go back and subtract 1 from all the Y values.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=138">Celius</a> — Wed Dec 12, 2007 7:56 pm</p><hr />

I didn't know sprites were delayed a scanline. That's wierd.<br /><br />So yeah, according to NESdev wiki, sprites do not wrap around if they are in positions $F9-$FF. If your sprite is at $00, and you move left one pixel, it'll be at $FF, so it will jump to the other side of the screen. Since there are no wrap arounds, the rest of your sprite will not be visible. That is also the case for Y coords.<br /><br />There aren't many ways to prevent this. If you want, you can use the sprite clipping so it won't be visible in the left column of the screen. For vertical movement, it's not that big of a deal if you're using an NTSC system, since the top two bars are cut off. I'd use sprite clipping, because the sudden disappearing is ugly.<br /><br />I looked over your code, and I noticed some things that looked like they may cause some sorts of problems. Not anything too big though.<br /><br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">   lda sprite_y<br />   clc<br />   sbc #1      ; compensate for ppu<br /></div><br /><br />Is there any reason for clearing the carry? Maybe there is, but this could be a typo. Just wanted to point it out.<br /><br />And I see you do this:<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent"><br />   lda #0<br />   ldx #$ff<br />-   sta $200, x<br />   dex<br />   bne -      ; clear sprite page<br /></div><br /><br />You know you can just load X with $00 and it will clear everything? If you do "ldx #$FF" for the loop, it'll just clear everything but the last byte.<br /><br />EDIT: I also don't think you're clearing the Sprite_X or Sprite_Y values before using them. That could be a problem. You'd do well to clear all of RAM with this simple loop:<br /><br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent"> lda #0<br /> tax<br />-<br /> sta $0,x<br /> sta $100,x<br /> sta $200,x<br /> sta $300,x<br /> sta $400,x<br /> sta $500,x<br /> sta $600,x<br /> sta $700,x<br /> inx<br /> bne -<br /></div><br /><br />I'm pretty sure the NES has random values in RAM on reset. Counting on them being #$00 is not a good thing to do.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=138">Celius</a> — Wed Dec 12, 2007 7:31 pm</p><hr />

But in this case Nintendulator is correct, sprites are delayed 1 scanline.  If you put it at 0,0 then displaying at 0,1 is right. <br /><br />If your sprite is at 0,0 and you move it left, it will now be at 255,0 and should display on the right side.  If you move it up it will be at 0,255 which is off the viewing area at the bottom.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=228">bunnyboy</a> — Wed Dec 12, 2007 5:41 pm</p><hr />
