<br />Hum... I guess it's because regular file compressors can compress the same data to about 60% of the size. I think I'd like to reach that mark too.
<br />
<br />Anyway, I still have some tweaking to do, I'll experiment with other ways of transforming the tiles based on previous ones, maybe even implement multiple transforms so that the encoder picks the one that results in better compression, PNG style. The bad part is the overhead of indicating the type of transform used, but the numbers will tell. The delta-coding itself came with a lot of overhead, as each bit plane must indicate if it was XOR'ed with a previous one, and if so, which one. But it still improved compression.
<br />
<br />Heh, it's fun to try this thing with other types of data... most things actually expand, but it did compress some text documents I had...!

<br />Compression makes a huge difference when memory is limited.  Hot Seat Harry used RLE compression, even for a data table.  On Garage Cart #1, a lot of the intro (characters for the menu and Nerdtracker 2 + 3 songs) fit in the space reclaimed by compressing CHR.  It's a 64kB ROM, and Solar Wars on there was originally 64kB by itself.  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />
<br />
<br />If I would've had better compression than RLE, I could've thrown more music on there.

I've been trying this out with FreeBASIC, but the code is really messy and I don't know if I could turn it into a good standalone utility. I'll try, though. I had some trouble switching to object-oriented programming, and I guess I still have trouble with that sometimes.<br /><br />I'm also still experimenting a bit to see if I can improve compression even more, and when I think I can't improve it anymore I'll decide the final format and code the final compressors and decompressors.<br /><br />I also have to code the decompression routines in 6502 asm, and see how fast it goes.

<br />I'll go back home tonight, where I already have some tile sets ready for testing.

<br />If it would be possible to make a compression sheme effective for a particular tileset, then if you'd be coding a game with compressed tiles, you'd definitely want a compression sheme particulary efficient for your game's tileset. I don't think it works that way tough.
<br />
<br />NB : A fun thing is that I remember Tokumaru stating earlier that CHR-ROM was better than CHR-RAM, and I was stating the opposite. And now, Tokumaru has a project where he's using CHR-RAM, and me I've a project where I use CHR-ROM. I think that's kinda ironical.

<br />You are absolutely right! =D I remember that! Know what? I got really spoiled by CHR-RAM now! =D I guess I do take back some of the things I said back then!
<br />
<br />Turns out that, by taking some of the time of the rendered frame, I can simulate CHR bankswitching, in small chunks of 16 tiles per frame. I'm using this to update the main character, doing some background animations and so on.

<br />It's not cheating. It's what just about every game for Genesis, Super NES, and Game Boy Advance does. Seriously, back up your <em>Sonic Advance</em> or <em>Kirby: Nightmare in Dream Land</em> Game Pak, load it up in VisualBoyAdvance, open the pattern table viewer (Tools &gt; Tile Viewer), and turn on automatic refresh. Scroll down to 0x06010000 (sprite cel VRAM), make Sonic run and jump, and see what CHR changes. <a href="http://www.pineight.com/gba/managing-sprite-vram.txt" class="postlink">This white paper</a> was written near the beginning of the GBA homebrew scene.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I know a lot of no-NES games does this (at the end they don't even bother mazing tiles, they just maze hard-coded tiles with hard cored positions on the screen, and put whathever graphics they need for the game's protagonist(s) here). I noticed at least Chrono Trigger, Golden Sun and Mega Man Battle Network does that (some of my all time favourite games), so I wouldn't be surprised if that would be the case of others as well.
<br />However, Battletoads is the only one that was able to do this for the NES ever. I of course exaggerate and this is by no means cheating, but you have to admit doing this on the NES is insane, due to the slow CPU and lack of $2007 DMA.
<br />I noticed Final Fantay IV advance goes a step further : In the menu, the map is just filled with continus tiles, and the whole tileset is modified to modify the content of the screen (like a bitmap image). This reduce the respond rate to scrolling menu commands, so they did it slightly differently in FF5 and FF6 advance.

<br />
<br />EDIT: Strangely enough, it doesn't use CHR-RAM, but it does dynamically update the characters (sort of). I've noticed that there is a 32-tile area in the pattern table that changes depending on how the player character is moved, but does not update if the character continually moves in the same direction. So I'm guessing that the ROM is bankswitched depending on how the character is moved, and that that bank holds all of the animations needed for that movement (since the character is 8 tiles, there is enough for 4 still frames per movement).
