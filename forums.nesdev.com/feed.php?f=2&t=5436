Late in the game there is an x-ray visor.  If I remember correctly this peels back one of the SNES's graphic layers to display secret passages and/or the weapon it takes to destroy blocks (not entirely sure).  There would be ways to compensate for that on the NES but it wouldn't be easy.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3438">UncleSporky</a> — Sat Jul 25, 2009 3:29 pm</p><hr />

I played the game a bit more and I kinda liked it (although I did find the default control scheme pretty bad, like Disch said). It is a good platformer.<br /><br />I still think it's doable on the NES, considering what I have seen so far. The effects (rotation, transparency and scaling) could be dropped without problems. There are some bosses and large enemies that would be hard to draw with sprites though...<br /><br />I don't know about enemies being tracked off screen, as I tried to shoot some of them off screen and it didn't work.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=95">tokumaru</a> — Sat Jul 25, 2009 2:38 pm</p><hr />

This information might be useful:<br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://tasvideos.org/SuperMetroidTricks.html#UsefulMemoryAddresses">http://tasvideos.org/SuperMetroidTricks ... yAddresses</a><!-- m --><br /><br />Super Metroid has very fast scrolling at times, and the scrolling has more sophisticated logic than typical NES games have.  Samus isn't in the dead center of the screen at all times, instead, when Samus runs fast the screen dynamically scrolls ahead so that the player has more time to react to obstacles that might be in the way.  16 bit values are used to represent the subpixel position, speed, and momentum of Samus.  Rooms can be huge and complex, and have objects that change state.  My guess is that those objects probably don't require too much RAM.  I am not sure what the limit is on the number of enemies in the room is, but they are actually tracked when they are off screen.  The screen is split to accomodate the sizable HUD, so the main screen is smaller than usual for a SNES sidescroller, I wonder if that is necessary for running the game at full speed.<br /><br />It seems that the consensus is that there is nothing too special about the engine Super Metroid uses.  I thought I read somewhere that it was fairly advanced, but I can't find what I read.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3993">RLError</a> — Sat Jul 25, 2009 2:26 pm</p><hr />

Super Metroid was one of the last Metroid games I played (including the Primes and all).  I don't hate it but I don't feel anything special for it.  You definitely need to have owned it during its heyday for it to feel like a masterpiece.  Lots of strange design decisions everywhere such as diagonal aiming mapped to two different buttons.<br /><br />And yes, jumping does feel like it resets your horizontal speed to an extent.  Unless you jump a certain way, I suppose...you can watch a speed run and half the time they seem to keep their momentum, half the time the jump is slower than the run.  EDIT:  Maybe it's that upon landing your speed is reset, so that subsequent jumps seem slower than they should be?<br /><br />There doesn't seem to be anything special about the physics.  It's true that there is much about the game that couldn't be replicated well on the NES but the physics aren't part of that.  I mean maybe the enemies drop to the floor when you shoot out their footing, unlike the NES Metroid where they spin in midair, but that's something that could be programmed in.  Same for animations like empty shells being spit out or missiles bouncing off of obstacles (I know that both of these have appeared in either SM, ZM or Fusion...).<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3438">UncleSporky</a> — Sat Jul 25, 2009 1:43 pm</p><hr />

Would the NES be capable of handling a physics engine like the one Super Metroid uses?  There have already been discussions about physics engines on these forums, but I don't think this hypothetical question has already been asked.  Super Metroid has very accurate physics, which might require a CPU more powerful than the one the NES uses.  On the other hand, the SNES CPU is not that much more powerful than the NES CPU.  There are NES games with nice physics engines, such as Solar Jetman, but Super Metroid has a deeper and more complex engine than that.<br />Sidescrolling exploration games are enhanced when the physics engine is sophisticated, so it is interesting to think about just how much the NES is capable of.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3993">RLError</a> — Sat Jul 25, 2009 10:07 am</p><hr />
