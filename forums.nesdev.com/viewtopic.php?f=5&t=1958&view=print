<br />
<br />After a period of about nine months I have decided to return to the NES scene. The reason... (blargg! stop swearing!) ...that I was away was my old computer crashed and I lost everything on it. Which was fantastic! Because it needed totally rewriting. Anyway...
<br />
<br />I'm back, and i'm here to make your lives a misery...
<br />
<br />HA HA HA HA HA HA HA!
<br />
<br />HA HA HA HA HA HA HA!
<br />
<br />HA HA HA!..
<br />
<br />Seriously now. I am back and I am nicer than ever. I am determined to make WedNESday work this time and get rid of all of the things that made it pants in the first place. Peace and love to all of you (esp. blargg). Nice to be back. Hopefully I'm gonna get a new job as well soon.
<br />
<br />My old PC was a P4 2.2Ghz 1Gb Ram. I now have a Dual P 3.2Ghz 1Gb RAM (faster of course). So I am very interested in Playstation emulation, which I will focus on as well. From NES to Playstation in one leap. Have I gone mad?

<br />Do you REALLY call this an old PC ? I've a brand new Athlon64 1.8GHz 512Mb RAM (however speed in Athlon CPUs cannot be compared with Pentium CPUs).
<br />I've tried Playstation emulation, but this slows down A LOT. I think even trough I've a new PC, I still have a pretty old video card (GeForce 2), so this may be why it is so slow. Also incompatibility with emulator is big, with the game I tried, Final Fantasy VII. The special effect in battle are abscent, screen transparency effects seems badly emulated, and animation is corny. Also, most noisy sound effects sound different, just like in old SNES emulators.

<br />When I said old, I meant the previous computer. It was from early 2002. The PC I have now was only Â£650. 17" Moniter, ATI Radeon x600, 1GB RAM, SB Audigy, Dual P 3.2Ghz. It runs sweetly (although the graphics card is quite cheap). As for Playstation emulation, yes it is not as easy or well researched as NES/SNES/Game Boy but it is a lot of fun and some of the emulators simply kick arse.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />PSX emulation does not need high end PC's... I used to play it in my old (after that I had a 1.7 GHz P4 and now I have an Athlon 64 3200) K6II 533 MHz with 128Mb of RAM and 4 Mb video card pretty well. Of course, not with the fancy stuff PSX emulators have today (high resolution, texture smoothing, etc), but with the old <em>Connectix</em> emulator. It almost didn't slow down, and many many games were playable. I don't know how that PC would do with modern PSX emulators though. I may still try, since it is still working, primarily as a DOS/WIN98 games box.

<br />heh. I remember playing some PSX games with both VGS and Bleem! on my parents P3 500mhz with 128MB RAM and a Voodoo3 and I think it run pretty decent.

<br />
<br />So am I - it's just an expression of annoyance with the fact that some people aren't satisfied with 2 year-old technology while I'm still using 5 year-old stuff.

<br />Like I said, I'm not giving up my PC, heh. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />
<br />I'd probably have to buy something to get it on the net, so I won't do that.  Dial-up would suck anyways.  I got it as a gift.  I might try controlling Squeedo through it's RS232, just for fun and to see it work (not for serious development, all the good tools are on PC anyways).  I mostly wanted one for music stuff, writing chiptunes with it's YM2149 (a lot like the AY-8910, but weirder) and since it has real MIDI ports I'll be sure to try using it to control my MIDINES cart.
