(Say if someone has 200 posts, all related to nesdev...then its fine. But when someone just comes in here for pirating games it's not. Rule enforced at mod's discretion (Sorry Tepples) )</div><br /><br />That thread/user proved to me that it doesn't even matter.  I intentionally ignored that ridiculousness only to receive two PM's asking for explicit detail on how to complete their repro.  There is no avoiding the absurdity.  Somehow a crazy ass story of how you broke something that is coincidentally also your hobby to create is supposed to motivate us to write you a detailed instruction on how to make yet another repro.  Unfortunately the few give a bad rap for those who are more tactful.</div><br /><br />Even if us not helping doensn't actually matter. I feel we still shouldn't be HELPING them. The good o'll &quot;but if I don't do it someone else will&quot; argument.

Any of<br />the more versed programmers and engineers who like holding peoples hands through experiments can drop in and do<br />so without annoying the ones that don't want to.<br /><br />3) There could be more but I'll just go with 1 &amp; 2 for now.<br /><br /><br />Myself I fall in the middle, I know a little about programming, a little more than that about electronics in general with<br />a real habbit of making odd carts of weird games and yep I've sold some of them I'm not gonna say I haven't. Mind you<br />most things I need help with are for my own uses. I've wrote guides before for noobs and some of the more seasoned vets<br />asked me not to post them as they just end up in the hands of those that are only looking to sell repro's for $100 a pop.<br />I'm not one of those guys, I've actually learned alot from this forum and I do like to share what I know when I can with<br />folks that at least seem genuinely intrested in the same vein I am (mind you I have given pointers in the past only to see<br />the user disapear 2 posts later and the same user name be on ebay with said info put to use for profit.)<br /><br /> It's an odd topic and a sensitive one for alot of people. Some far to one side, some far to the other and some in the middle.<br />End of the day a sub-section as questioned in the OP I think would be a positive thing all around for everyone no matter what part of the argument they are from.

Figure out a &quot;charter&quot; for each in order to distinguish between them, then make a boilerplate copy of each to the SNES side.  That way, anyone wanting to ignore repro discussions would be able to hide the DIY forums, but still have access to the discussions on the commercial carts if they wanted to do so.  I feel like repro threads are as dissimilar to commercial carts in their discussions as they are to software development.  As to a formal charter, I feel like that's a good idea, but I don't have time to draft one myself, though I'll definitely weigh in on any discussion once somebody drafts one.

If it happens a second time then the moderators should have a discussion about that individual.  Everything else should be fair game.  As for a general guideline there isn't a lot of &quot;hand-holding&quot; for &quot;n00bs&quot; and Reproduction discussion isn't something that we'd like to see pop up in the newbie forum either; since it sort of infests and takes over.<br /><br />1.) &quot;Don't be a dick.&quot;<br />2.)
