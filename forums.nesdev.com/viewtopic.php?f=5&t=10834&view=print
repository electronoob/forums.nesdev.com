		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />That reminds me that, to make their games &quot;arcade perfect&quot; ports, Micronics usually just stretched the arcade screens of vertical aligned games (1942, Exed Exes, Ikari, etc.) to the whole TV screen when they made the Famicom versions, so sprites look wide and fat. The result is, they look lame. (It may probably be just they didn't care about pixel aspect and drew the graphics assuming all the pixels are square though.)

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Gilbert: That might explain why Mario is taller in Donkey Kong (arcade) than in Donkey Kong (ColecoVision and NES).<br /><br />Another complicating factor is that a common PAR for home computers was 6:7 (Apple II, IBM CGA, and several others that used twice NTSC colorburst as the pixel clock) or even 3:4 (Commodore 64). If game graphics were drawn on one of these home computers, it might have affected the artist's conception of PAR. The only home computers I can think of that use NES-like PAR are the SC-3000 and MSX.<br /><br />I plead guilty to not taking PAR into account in Thwaite. Explosions are a circle of radius 12 pixels, despite the 8:7 PAR of NTSC NES and the close to 11:8 PAR of PAL NES and Dendy. All I can offer in my defense is that assuming square pixels makes the collision detection simpler.<br /><br />You can probably add every Super Game Boy-enhanced game too, as they usually don't have different sprites for Super NES play (8:7 PAR) from the sprites used on a Game Boy's square-pixel LCD panel.<br /><br />Sprites looking wide and fat in general on a low-def console like the NES might just be <a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GraphicsInducedSuperDeformed" class="postlink">low-def super-deformity</a>.
