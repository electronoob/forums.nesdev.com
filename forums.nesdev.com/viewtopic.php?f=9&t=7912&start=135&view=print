<br />
<br />Well if you've flashed the AVR properly and set the fuses properly, then there is really only one likely issue.
<br />
<br />Is your computer giving you a warning that the "device is not recognized" when you plug it in?
<br />
<br />For windows 7 you will need to install the lib32usb drivers, but you shouldn't need to do anything for windows XP.  Atleast that's how it worked for me and everyone else to my knowledge.
<br />
<br />Assuming everything above is true I would venture to say you have an issue with your circuit.  My guess is you've connected something up wrong.  If you provide a close up picture I *might* be able to give advice on what to check.  Without that I can't really help much, just keep checking all your connections for shorts and opens with a multimeter...

<br />
<br />You could perform a verification of the firmware with the AVR programmer.  But the only way to really be sure I guess is that is works...
<br />
<br />Without knowing too many details about what you're working with I can't really be of much help, sorry.
<br />
<br />Unfortunately I wouldn't put this up there with projects that would be good for your first microcontroller project.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />So I've found a bug/issue with the PCB on the kits I sent out.
<br />
<br />I made the mistake of assuming the kazzo firmware left the pin I used for the bootloader as a floating or pulled up input.  Turns out the firmware ties the pin to ground and when the bootloader switch is up in kazzo mode the board is wired to pull that pin to Vcc.  So yeah theres a bit of current there and the mcu gets a little warm to the touch but no damage has been seen yet... <img src="./images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" alt=":(" title="Sad" />  
<br />
<br />There are a couple temporary fixes.  
<br />
<br />The layman's fix: just toggle the switch down to BL immediately after the kazzo has been plugged in.  This still allows for normal operation because the bootloader switch is only checked once when it boots up.  So the switch only needs to be up in normal kazzo mode when you first apply power to the mcu.  After that you can take the switch down to BL and remove the high current condition.
<br />
<br />The other fix is probably how I should have designed the board.  You could desolder the bootloader switch and clip the top pin off the switch and solder it back in.  That way the BL switch toggles between floating to GND instead of Vcc to GND like I made it.  
<br />
<br />The preffered fix I think is to whip up another firmware version that changes that pin to a input with pull up instead of output GND like the current release.
<br />
<br />I tried to recompile the firmware and was sucessful in resolving the high current issue by changing the DDR.  But I couldn't get successful dumps having issues with CHR data for some reason a couple bytes are wrong when dumping. 
<br />
<br />I haven't spent a lot of time yet trying to fix this.  But if someone is able to help out heres some more detail.
<br />
<br />All I did was comment out the original first line and replace it with the one below.  It's line 58 of bus_access.c  It's not really needed but the pullup could be enabled as well.
<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />//USB_MISC_DIR = &#40;0b1100 &lt;&lt; 4&#41; | 0b0011; //empty pin use OUT<br />USB_MISC_DIR = &#40;0b1000 &lt;&lt; 4&#41; | 0b0011; //bootloader board bug!&nbsp; configure the bootloader pin as input!</div>
<br />
<br />Now that I've got a better understanding of all this bootloader stuff, I'm realizing that the original kazzo DID have a bootloader.  It was done somehow through the cartridge interface.  I'm guessing you could load the new firmware onto a flashcart or WRAM or something...  IDK but it really doesn't matter aside from getting things to compile properly.  I ended up compiling everything and then just deleting the bootloader section of the firmware from the hex file.
<br />
<br />That's basically how I came up with the firmware that shipped with the kits.  Speaking of it's here: <a href="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/18341918/kazzo_mega164p_clipped.hex" class="postlink">http://dl.dropbox.com/u/18341918/kazzo_mega164p_clipped.hex</a>
<br />and the AVR bootloader software is here amongst other places: <a href="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/18341918/HIDBootFlash.exe" class="postlink">http://dl.dropbox.com/u/18341918/HIDBootFlash.exe</a>
<br />
<br />If you compare my clipped version to the firmware in the release: 
<br />
<br /><a href="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/18341918/kazzo_mega164p_original.hex" class="postlink">http://dl.dropbox.com/u/18341918/kazzo_mega164p_original.hex</a>
<br />
<br />you can see I just clipped of the chunk that resided in the bootloader space (0x38000 and beyond)
<br />
<br />I may as well put this up too: <a href="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/18341918/KazzoBootloader.hex" class="postlink">http://dl.dropbox.com/u/18341918/KazzoBootloader.hex</a>  That's the bootloader's firmware that MUST be programmed via an AVR programmer.
<br />
<br />Oh and the fuses should be low: 0xc0, high: 0x9f, and extended: 0xff.
<br />
<br />Now if you don't really know what you're doing with the bootloader I would say your best not to play around with it.  If we get a new release of the firmware I can give SPECIFIC instructions and files to complete the update (basically steps 4-7 below with the new firmware).  It's not hard, but if you load the wrong files you'll brick the kazzo until you get your hands on a AVR programmer.
<br />
<br />So just to be clear these were the steps I took in flashing the mcu's I sent out:
<br />1) program the fuse bits using AVR programmer. (high 0x9f, low 0xc0) These are DIFFERENT than the released documents due to differences in bootloader and whatnot.
<br />2) flash KazzoBootloader.hex with an AVR programmer.
<br />3) Now toss the AVR programmer to the side and  load up the HIDbootFlash.exe software.
<br />4) Place the bootloader switch down to BL and THEN, plug in the USB cable.
<br />5) follow the three software steps, find device, load/navigate to firmware: this is where you'd select kazzo_mega164p_clipped.hex  then click flash device.
<br />6) Now you can take the switch up to normal (non-bootload mode).  Either unplug and plug back in, or just tap the reset button.
<br />7) the device should now be recognized as the kazzo.
<br />
<br />So if you don't own an AVR programmer the one thing you would NOT want to do with the bootloader is try to program the mcu with a hex file that had anything residing in address 0x380000 and beyond.  If you do that the bootloader will actually start to write over itself.  It will actually overwrite everything until it overwrites the code it's actually operating from.  Then you'd get a failure and you would have successfully "bricked" the kazzo and need to reflash the mcu with an AVR programmer.
<br />
<br />Hopefully that's clear enough...  If anyone doesn't want to deal with any of this you send me an email.  Send me back your kazzo and I'll fix the bootloader switch as described above essentially correcting for the board "error"

<br />None of this really applies to you.  It really only applies to the people with the kits i supplied.
<br />
<br />You would edit your firmware by just flashing your mcu with your avr programmer.  It would seem that based on your sitiation updating the firmware should be of little concern to you.  Just program your mcu with the released firmware.

<br />
<br />How is it the same???
<br />
<br />You're using the ATmega 16A  atleast that's what you said.
<br />
<br />Did you put the atmega16 in the PCB that I designed???
<br />
<br />If you did, there's no wonder it doesn't work...  My PCB was for the Atmega164.  and the firmware is for the atmega164 not the atmega16.  There may be a atmega16 version out there but you'll most likely have to rewrite it yourself.  I think there are only atmega8 and atmega164 versions available if I remember correctly.
<br />
<br />Why didn't you use the ATmega164?
