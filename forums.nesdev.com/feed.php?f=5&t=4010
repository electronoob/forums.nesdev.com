1. Who are you?<br />There are some who call me............... John<br /><br />2. Where are you from/Where do you live?<br />Born and raised in Memphis, TN. Lived in Birmingham, AL a couple of years. I ended up coming back to Memphis.<br /><br />3. Why are you into NES emulation?<br />I also prefer real hardware. I like how easy it is to make really cool modifications to the NES hardware. Also the NES is a classic that will never die. Unfortunately I've never been great with Assembly. I was "taught" Motorola 6800 in college as I have an Associates degree in computer engineering, but it was never my strong language. I say "taught" because it was taught in a manner that assumed I already knew it, and I've never been able to learn that way. So, don't look forward to any games from me any time soon. I'm sure if I learn 6502 it will come to me slowly. I've always been much stronger in hardware. I'd love to find a connector that would fit the expansion slot!<br />I also love my supernes. If I could find a Powerpak like cart for it I'd love that too!<br /><br />4. What do you do in your spare time?<br />This is my spare time. So I guess I sit and stare blankly at the computer screen, or play with my NES. <br /><br />5. Age. Pets. Marital Status. Children?<br />30, 5 cats, a dog, and a Parakeet. I've been Married for 6 years, almost 7 and have no children yet.<br /><br />6. Any funny stories? (hopefully NES related)<br />My 20 year old NES Max still works. I still use it. Not really funny just a story. I have 2 NES systems, The one I've had since 4th grade, and one I got in a garage sale. The only reason the one I've had since 4th grade has ever been opened was to install a new cartridge connector. The other one gets all the modifications. Extra audio mod, blue power LED, disabled lockout chip, hopefully eventually a copynes usb. <br /><img src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v107/super-hampster/NES%20MOD/bluelight.jpg" alt="Image" /><br /><br /><br />7. Do you have a job/Are you a student? If so what?<br />I do onsite service calls fixing computers. <br /><br />8. What does the future hold for you?<br />My wife is in nursing school. She should graduate in October and hopefully then we can buy a house and start our family.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=493">Super-Hampster</a> — Wed Mar 11, 2009 8:25 pm</p><hr />

1. My name is Derek, but I enjoy using the pseudonym Zom online<br />2. I'm from Central PA, and still live in Central PA<br />3. I realized recently that new games suck, and old games kick ass. My NES still works perfectly, so I started playing it again, and then felt an overwhelming urge to make a game for it.<br />4. I like to play the piano, read, play video games, and program.<br />5. 25, two cats, married to the love of my life who can consistently kick my ass at Dr. Mario, and no kids (yet)<br />6. How about gameboy related? One time I transcribed Music C from tetris to sheet music, then the next day I went to a library, got out a random book on music theory, flipped to a random page, and found Music C there. It is a menuet from the 3rd french suite in B minor, by bach.<br />7. I'm a software developer.<br />8. I have no idea what the future holds for me. Probably economic apocalypse and hunger. But supposing that doesn't happen, I sincerely hope to finish one, maybe three really good video games of my own within my lifetime.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3735">GradualGames</a> — Fri Feb 27, 2009 1:04 pm</p><hr />
