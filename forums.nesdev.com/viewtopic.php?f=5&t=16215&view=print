I think our very early VHS player ( it had a remote, with 3 buttons and it was not wireless ) had &quot;Auto Scrubbing&quot; as one of it features, i.e fast forward and rewind <img src="./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" />

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Video tapes whas my first contact with the term, then i found it in audio editing like rainwarrior mentioned.<br /><br />Manually scrubbing back and forth* in an animation loop - especially one with several frames - is good for detecting a good fps tempo for your animation (if you're free to pick one), what frames should extend longer, or shorter, and so on.<br /><br />*hold and drag position marker rather than use buttons. I sometimes send a loop gif to my phone for tactile scrubbing.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Addition to the etymology:<br /><br />I think audio software and DAW:s picked it up like this<br /><br />analog reel to reel tapes -&gt; DAT tapes (1987-2005*)  -&gt; disk storage.<br /><br />*For long, you'd store studio audio on DAT (which is a lossless format) and MIDI on disk systems. <br />Durutti Column was first to use DAT in studio, followed by other Factory Records-related groups. Some were even released on DAT for home use, like New Order. Most studios went to other media by the 00:s (disk or back to analogue tape)  but i used DAT as late as 2003. Sony discontinued DAT in 2005.<br /><br />There were predecessors to DAT in the late 70s but i'm uncertain if they ever saw widespread use for music recording/editing.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Another thing with DAT is that you can't &quot;scrub&quot; in the real sense of moving tape over headers back and forth, because the format is one-directional. Scrub here would mean move the tape some distance, then play a short length, and repeat until you've found the point in time you're looking for. But you could ID and store keyframes to which you could return to by dialling the ID.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />The way you'd set up an editing studio based on DAT is you record each channel via channel strips or a recording mixer set to as neutral as possible to DAT deck #1, then, from DAT #1 you play back into your editing mixer, where you also patch in effects, and record do DAT deck #2 when all the settings are satisfactory. The two decks are synchronized. Because of the timestamp/ID system, you can set them to record within/between two timestamps/keyframes, thus overwriting select pieces of a track rather than the track as a whole. But it's fidgety so you may want to record to a vacant track and dub/mix where applicable/possible. <br /><br />Larger rigs would contain several A and B sets of decks to give more channels, but the one i used was a two deck system. <br /><br />Compared to software editing, it's tedious. There's a large amount of destructive editing, and a lot of passes through D/A and A/D stages which you want to keep at a minimum (tepples' post just showed up when i submitted). <br /><br />But - compared to analogue tape splicing which i've never even considered trying when i've had the opportunity to do so, it's a breeze. All the usual analogue ping-pong and overdub techniques still apply. You can't flange (by bending the position of tape with your thumb) or chorus/pitch shift (by applying force to the reel driver making it inert) like you would on analogue tape, though.
