		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />the instructions are available elsewhere, but I brought up the discussion of Kirby's Adventure causing slowdown, with a fix of using an overclocked CPU to eliminate it.

<br />
<br />The image pretty much shows everything I did. Although pulling up the ppu's clock was not necessary, I did it so I could "see" a changed clock speed (since the speedup only effects the sound of games timing from vblanks).
<br />
<br />I don't actually have a copy of Kirby's Adventure, I'll be taking care of that soon enough.
<br />
<br />I'll post some videos, just give me a bit...
<br />
<br />P.S.<img src="./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" />on't ask about the CIC...
<br />
<br />P.S.S.:The other crystal is on a seperate pcb because the only oscillator I had lying around ran at 48MHz, so I constructed an oscillator myself:

<br />I'll add that to my most wanted list. That game feels like it's programmed to run at a lower rate though, but it's nothing that can't be tested.

<br />i'd like to know if river city ransom falls under this category as well

<br />There's a good chance these both use the same engine...just a hunch....

I'm putting together a more advanced version of it some people might enjoy .. right now, I'm doing some work to try and exceed my current maximum, 4.2 MHz (&gt;230% original CPU speed but I'm a crazy bastard like that.) 
<br />
<br />What is the frequency you ended up with? Good job on the homemade oscillator circuit.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Wow, I didn't expect the author of that guide to reply, lol.
<br />
<br />The crystal runs at 28.224MHz (which /12=2.352MHz). Like I said, the only actual oscillator I have runs at 48MHz, and even though that worked, most games locked up with timing errors, irq lockouts, etc., although I was suprised that mario 3 showed the title screen quite stable (with the IRQs disabled).
<br />
<br />Recently I shorted out somthing on my NES that prevented any kind of operation (although bus pins were still functioning apparently), so I ended up eBay'n a new one ($25 w/Free shipping, bare bones and I got a free game + controller, not like I needed the psu or rf, lol).
<br />
<br />I am now installing a switch to roll back to the original frequency, and it's really creeping me out that some games (especially Ultimate Stuntman) are allowing clock changes in action.
<br />
<br />Hopefully I'll be getting a copy of Kirby soon to see if this actually helps.
<br />
<br />I guess I can make a new video as well, lol, since not many ppl are doing this and it's seems like one of the most off-beat overclocks (...to me anyways).

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Kirby had the most dramatic improvement. Most lag was gone at 2.3 MHz, pretty much all of it gone at 2.6, and aside from the status bar twitching a bit (CPU missing IRQs from the MMC I'm sure, as you mentioned) it was perfectly stable up to 4 MHz, I think 4.2 actually, where my CPU maxed out at.
<br />
<br />You're not the first person to find on-the-fly clock changes work without crashes-- I used a variable oscillator and switching the multiplier settings on its PCB would not crash the system, ever. My friend Rob made a switch to toggle between onboard clock and an oscillator and it doesn't cause crashes, either. I was surprised because when overclocking the MegaDrive/Genesis I found you need to halt the 68000 before switching its clock most of the time, or it'll lock up.
