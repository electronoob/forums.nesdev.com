Does it stink because you can't get access to a document that few of us have access to, and you think they're withholding it out of malice, or does it stink because you're too lazy to find the information, which many of us have already made available, or even to ask questions about it?
<br />
<br />An official NES document is extremely rare and hard to come by.  Not many people are willing to part with it, and scanning a document of a few hundred pages takes a VERY LONG time, and TONS of effort that not many are willing to go through if there is little or no information in it that can't be found elsewhere.
<br />
<br />In the time you've spent complaining about not having the official NES documentation, you could have read up about how to program for it, and all the little nuances, and you could have probably coded some small test demo in the time you had left over.  But you can't (or won't) see that there is very little (if indeed, anything left) that can be learned from the official NES docs.
<br />
<br />And yet you claim that the community stinks, even though we've tried to be as helpful as we could (really, I too would like to see these docs, I don't deny curiosity on my part).  You claim that we haven't written any decent games (which is not completely true) because we lack the official NES documentation, because you hope to find some hidden nuggets of truth stowed away.  Yet you will not take the words of those who actually HAVE the documentation and have read it themselves.
<br />
<br />Listen.  Calling us names, telling us we stink, calling into question our individual talents or throwing a temper tantrum every time things don't go your way is NOT going to get us on your side.  We've worked hard to help out one another and build up this community, and we don't shun newbies simply because they don't have the knowledge  But we simply can't abide people who act childish and bitch just because a few people who have documentation you don't (which isn't of real use anyway) can't be bothered to scan it or send it to you through the mail, purchasing notwithstanding.

The time required could be alot depending on your existing skills and knowledge. None of us here learned all we know in a day or a week. If you decide you are serious about learning and willing to put forth the effort, NESDEV is a great place to find information. You clearly seem interested in the NES and want to see new NES games. While the technical issues of programming might seem too far out for you, there are other areas you could invest some time in. While all games have to be programmed, they also have to be designed. Graphics must be drawn and music must be composed. But it's ok if none of these creative areas seem like what you want to do. There's nothing wrong with just being a fan of the NES and enjoying playing NES games.

I started with absolutely zero knowledge of programming. I really didn't know what a byte was, and for all I knew the 6502 Jump instruction is what made Mario jump on the SMB games.
<br />
<br />It did take me time to learn though. And I'm not saying it's easy, but it's definitely possible, even with what little documentation exists.

Would that still be illegal distribution, even though it was in their own words (so therefore not an EXACT copy), or am I wrong? &gt;.&gt;
<br />
<br />I ask this in part because I'm curious about whether that would be illegal, and also because I'd really like to see the docs as well, if possible.

If something isn't explained to the fullest and or a slightly vague, then use the forums or dev chat channels. I mean, considering some of the <em>other</em> platforms - there's quite a bit of info on the NES architecture.  
<br />
<br /> It's true that the NES is not the *simplest* console to start coding on. If you find it a bit overwhelming, then go try out another system. The original B&amp;W Gameboy is dead simple, has a great debugger, lots of info, and lots of demos and example source code. Then come back to the NES. Many concept cross over between consoles. Or you can stick it out and just start with the NES. Like anything else that requires self study, get as much info as you can and spend hours pouring over it. Make your own notes of what you interpret of that information. Try to confirm some things/concepts with others that are familiar. Write simple, simple, simple demos to test out what you know or to verify. Etc. Nobody is born knowing how to code for the NES, so you have to start somewhere.

<br />There are plenty of people on this board who are not a big fans of 8080-family CPUs such as that of the 8-bit Game Boy. I'd almost recommend that people start out on <a href="http://alleg.sf.net/" class="postlink">Allegro</a>, then go to GBA, and finally NES if they want to enter NESdev through the Game Boy line.

<br />
<br /> <img src="./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /> I'm not a big fan either, even though it was my first console/CPU. 65x&gt;8080/z80. Though the cpu <em>is</em> pretty simple/straight forward in design and easy to code for, albeit pretty slow instruction cycle times (T states).  But the video hardware is nice and clean for the GB. Very simple and easy to understand imo.

<br />Was this hironical ? I remember info about the original Gameboy being almost notexistant I tried to find info about it and all I know about it is that it has a Z80 CPU and that its screen has a lower resolution than the NES.
<br />It this wasn't hironical I should have to try again.
<br />
<br />Also, the SMD componants in GB's and GBC's cartridges are quite discouraging as opposed to good old full size componants in NES cartridges, easier to replace to make your own programms. I'm unsure if any GBA devcart also support GB/GBC, as it looks like no DS devcart support GBA.
