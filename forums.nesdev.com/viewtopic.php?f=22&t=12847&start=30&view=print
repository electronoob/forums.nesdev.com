The contents are defined in <a href="https://github.com/cc65/cc65/blob/master/libsrc/nes/crt0.s" class="postlink">crt0.s</a>, which show that it's just 3 more pointers that I guess are used internally by the CC65 libraries. They all point to the same empty IRQ handler (just an RTI instruction).<br /><br />I don't recommend using that, though. It's better to use libraries directly oriented toward gaming, like <a href="http://shiru.untergrund.net/articles/programming_nes_games_in_c.htm" class="postlink">the one Shiru made</a>, or perhaps look at the source code for <a href="http://www.rainwarrior.ca/music/coltrane_src.zip" class="postlink">this music project</a> of mine for another example.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Learn how their syntaxes are different and change the code. It's usually very cosmetic changes, like using [] instead of (), or a slightly different way to creating anonymous labels. Some of it you could do with a quick regex search and replace. Sometimes you can't, especailly if it's using a feature specific to the assembler (e.g. ca65's extensive macro system). A program that could automatically convert, reliably, would be as complex as an assembler itself. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" /> (Actually one way to convert is just to assemble it, and then use a disassembler on the result.)<br /><br />If you're going through a tutorial, you might as well just read the sample code and convert it manually as you're typing it in to your own code, instead of just trying to copy-paste-regex it into shape. That way you'll at least get used to the language a little bit?<br /><br /><sub>...or just learn ca65 and join the dark side! JOIN USSSSSSSSSSSSS... HISSSSSSS...</sub>

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />This is probably not of interest to the original poster, but I'll mention it anyways:<br /><br />One way to convert stuff from ca65 to other assemblers is to generate an o65 relocatable binary file from the source, and then run that through the co65 tool to get an  expanded source file which has all of the code (including macros) expanded into a set of .byte and .word commands that are very easy to adapt to other assemblers in an automated way. The nice thing is that this kind of converted source code is relocatable. This is mostly useful if you want to distribute a relocatable, statically linkable library for multiple different assemblers (I used it in my MUSE sound library). It doesn't help if you want to actually be able to <em>modify</em> the source code after translation, as it's practically indecipherable.<br /><br />BTW: I remember Shiru had some sort of automated conversion tool included with his FamiTone2 library. I think the source format was NESASM in that one, and it had some limitations, but you might want to check it out anyways.

The only problem is that ca65 in specific kind of has a weird learning curve to it. Maybe giving asm6 to beginners and ca65 to people with previous experience would work? XD
