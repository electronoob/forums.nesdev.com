NSF is limited to 1 MiB as per NSF spec, but entrants are warned that voters who listen on PowerPak won't be able to listen to entries larger than 248 KiB. No more than 5 tracks.</li><li>Each category has its own voting.</li><li>Two months from announcement to submission deadline; one more month for voting.</li><li>Entrants are expected to keep authorship confidential until voting is complete, in order to prevent voting based on name recognition. This means no self-promotion and no soliciting pre-submission critique from the public.</li><li>A cartridge is made of the top-rated entries among those that the project is allowed to distribute, so long as they don't use Famicom expansion audio or more than 64 KiB of data. Almost all of these come from the original category, but I was told a well-received cover of pre-1923 classical music would be considered for inclusion.</li></ul><br />We might draw an analogy between Famicompo's cover category and this one-shot remix category. We have the same 64 KiB limit, but not the confidentiality.<br /><br />One thing we might grade on is user-visible improvement, obviously. Another is value for space, as I worry about whether we'll be able to fit everything into a 16 Mbit cart (like <em>Action 52</em> and the <em>FFVII</em> demake). An entry that allows multiple games that were formerly separate to share a PRG bank, such as by sharing the audio driver or text font or basic PPU interface code or whatever, might score points in value for space.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I agree. Multiplayer games are lots of fun when you bring someone over, but they get low scores categorically. It's kind of hard to require all peer reviewers to play them with a friend, so a differently defined prize for multiplayer entries or even a category of its own could perhaps be beneficial. <br /><br />Multiplayer being defined as:<br />-2 or more players cooperate, compete and/or duel<br /><br />not as:<br />-2 or more players take turns playing a single player campaign without any meaningful ingame interaction.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I think having a separate multiplayer category would: reduce motivation to include a multiplayer mode into a main game (such as in f-ff), potentially lead to too few games per category, and remove the off chance that a multiplayer game could pull a prize in the main category.<br /><br />Perhaps it would be better to simply have an additional question on the judging questionnaire, such as &quot;Rate Multiplayer Experience: 1~5, NA&quot;<br /><br />The scores from the multiplayer experience would not add into the 50 point total for the overall score, but would instead be used for a separate ranking to establish, say, a 1st through 3rd place for &quot;Best Multiplayer Experience.&quot;<br /><br />This way, something like f-ff (which has both established single and multi-player) would potentially be eligible for both prizes.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I agree with both. M-tee's suggestion is great, but it can be seen as unfair that multiplayer games can potentially win a higher summed prize than other games; however somewhat unlikely based on the history so far. <br /><br />My suggestion would be that in the case an entry was ranked high enough to score both a normal prize and the &quot;best multiplayer prize&quot;, the lesser prize of the the two would be passed on down that rank to the next highest entry. The entrant wins simply wins the prize representing the most significant achievement of the two, while being awarded the fame. <br /><br />The difference between entries being multiplayer oriented or having a multiplayer component, and games that don't, would what prizes you might be able to win; but not how much the prize would be.<br /><br />I hope this will incentivize people to keep making multiplayer games despite their categorically low ranking in the normal competition, and maybe even inspire to dare elaborate more on the player to player interaction element.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I haven't thiught of it deeply, but I kind of like the possibility of winning a bonus for multiplayer along with a  normal award because it would encourage a rosk vs reward decision making process: Do I use a precious portion of my 64k to include a multiplayer mode or more single player content? Do I use a portion of my coding time to implement, test, and balance multiplayer or polish what I have?<br /><br />EDIT:<br />...although with Frankengraphics' suggestion, that temptation would still be there, so no harm in going that way.
