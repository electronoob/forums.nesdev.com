I know in my case it was worth the extra time to write a graphical editor for this purpose. Hopefully I'll end up making more than one game for the NES and I'll never have to write another editor, just additional map compressor plugins.

<br />I suppose you could first define all the possible metatiles, say 64 max for 16x16.  Then define all the special objects as metatiles.  This assumes converter doesn't need to care about the PPU's maximum.  So if you defined 64 additional 'special' metatiles, then you have 6 more bits of data to convert and put in a another table for your program to interpret.
<br />
<br />So you'd end up with a BMP file of all your graphics, and all the special objects in the game.  That would be followed by the map.  Since the CPU needs to know what's going on, it maybe best that the converter be able to use fixed locations when creating the metatile data.
<br />
<br />I'm not sure if that's as workable as just having a separate layer for special objects, but i guess it could work OK.  When it's all on the same layer, seems like it can be a little ambiguous.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I actually have what you would consider "special tiles" for the background knocked down to about 5 bytes per screen, so they just get stored on their own.
<br />
<br />So i have a newer version of this script that's implemented RLE compression and outputs the tiles as letters instead of numbers. The code isn't very pretty though, so i'm not going to post it right now unless someone wants to use it right away. Once i get some free time i'll comment the code and clean it up.
<br />
<br />The reason the new script outputs letters instead of numbers is so it's easier to do a find/replace to swap out meta-tiles. I'm using a hybrid RLE, so it looks like this "flag, tile, #repeated". If you go through and replace the output for "1" with "3", then go through on the next pass and replace tile "3" for tile "7" you're going to catch all of the "repeat 3 times" values too. By making the tiles letters, you can just do a find/replace on the letter for the tile number and don't have to worry about catching the RLE values by mistake.
