<br />There are some decent-sounding FOACs without much of a slowdown problem. The thing is none of them seems strong in every regard .. one will have great audio reproduction in one game and awful in another, for example.. another big issue is the best FOACs are usually in shitty low-budget consoles and marketed nowhere near as strongly as those using worse FOACs like Generation NEX, Yobo/Neo Fami, etc.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Comparing the Yobo/Neo Fami side by side with the "Famulator" (another popular FC clone, at least in Japan), as well as a genuine FC Model 2, I noted the Famulator had superior audio reproduction and very little to no slowdown that wasn't present on the real machine. However the Neo Fami had the worst audio in my mini-roundup, and there was a surprising slowdown issue. In fact it was so bad some parts of games became unplayable, such as the final boss battle in Hoshi no Kirby/Kirby's Adventure.
<br />
<br />I'm curious how they ended up with a "slow" FOAC and why if so many variants are being made, why no one is making an effort to improve the technology. I guess it's because the ~15 year old FOAC designs work well enough to sell Famicom clones, and the differences can just be chalked up to discrepancies in cloning clone chips, cloned from the FC. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt=":roll:" title="Rolling Eyes" />
<br />
<br />Something good at least to be said about the Neo Fami and Famulator; they don't seem to exhibit the strange pitch increase evident in FOACs that have better imitation of the pulse channels. It seems you can't have everything. So some games sound decent (SMB) and some sound mediocre-to-hideous (Kirby) while on cheaper systems like what I'm just semi-affectionately calling 2 Famiclones I own-- the BS-Fami and the Soccer BS-Fami-- can come extremely close to accurate reproduction of pulse-heavy audio like in Kirby and yet they irredeemably destroy the audio of SMB by distorting the pitch of everything.

<br />I said it somewhere before, what someone needs to do is come up with a good NOAC design, GPL it, and then notify all Famiclone manufacturers. Problem solv-ed.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Kevin Horton made a NES FPGA that is allegedly pretty close to perfect, to hear him tell it at least. But the microcontroller is probably way too expensive for most famicom clone makers, when they can just as easily keep doing what they're doing, and profit from it .. most people don't seem to really care if it's exactly right if they're not a retro gaming fanatic like us. So except for companies like Messiah who get a big kick out of hyping the shit out of "Resurrecting the NES" I doubt they'd really care as long as it sells. Messiah clearly didn't care either because they just bought a random crappy clone and resold it with a lot of hype, to appeal to people who didn't know any better and didn't know about the massive clone market.
