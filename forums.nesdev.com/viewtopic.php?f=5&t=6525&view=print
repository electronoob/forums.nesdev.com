<br />My game is a slope detecting 8 way scrolling platformer with 2 player simultaneous co-op (that might be removed for speed reasons if I can't optimize everything enough).
<br />
<br />Everything has to be as fast as possible in a game like this or it'll hit lag quite often. I try to get a good feel for how slow each routine can be in a worst case scenario, and use a cycle counting emulator to time it. If it's slower than the goal, I go through it line by line multiple times to see if I can make it faster. If I can't the way it's written, I'll try to replan the logic so that it's faster.

<br />That's not a dirty trick, that's a very practical approach.

<br />I do something similar with my PC game attempts.

<br />Are you asking if you're surprised?
<br />
<br />When I first learned programming, I hardly designed anything, or made it easy to understand. I kept all the state in my mind, and enjoyed spending time fixing things. Over the years, I've come to greatly dislike code that has lots of cryptic stuff that is error-prone. I don't know how I worked on the things back then like that. Maybe I just had more ability, but what a waste of it on the messes of code I wrote. I've come to see bugs as signs of design problems, not merely mistakes while coding. Design isn't merely about meeting the requirements, it's about making something that can be reasonably implemented and understood by humans. &lt;/rant&gt;

<br />
<br />This is exactly what I want to avoid.  When you keep working in new features, your code turns into a mess of hacks and addons.
<br />
<br />Diving into the code right away can be fun, but it ends up being a mess.
<br />
<br />
<br />Designing everything, planning out where things and going to interact and how, figuring out what features you're going to implement and how, and leaving wiggle room for possible/probable future expansion -- that is the hard part.  That's what takes the time.
<br />
<br />Get all of that out of the way and the actual coding flies by.
<br />
<br />and +1 to what blargg said.  I've been trying to get better about writing coherent code, but it can be hard sometimes.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Yeah, well, I still have plenty of improvement to do in writing comprehensible code. The single, biggest step I took to starting on a path to improving was to kick the optimization habit. I don't know about others, but I early-on picked up the habit of optimizing things. It became a kind of compulsion, very fun, but destructive to code quality and overall ability to improve the code without introducing many bugs. The mention of optimizing here is what prompted me to post, because that's the single biggest seductive trap there is in programming. As an aside, I think that doing NES and other assembly coding is good, because there optimization must be done more, and there are far more opportunities for lots of nifty and useful tricks. It gets that out of my system, so when I'm doing C++, I can focus on functionality rather than speed.
