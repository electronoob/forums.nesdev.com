The premise of this program is that it is a DMC converter that has a UI and several options.  It has no name yet <img src="./images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" alt=":(" title="Sad" /><br /><br />Description-<br /><br />Converts a PCM .wav (16 or 8-bit, stereo or mono) to DMC format.  Only waves above 33144hz will work properly--others will play too fast.  If you have a 22khz wave you want to play, convert it to 44khz (or if possible, 33144hz) in some other program first.  My program converts the sample rate for larger-than-33144 rates but it does a dirty job of it, so the cleanest sound will probably result from you putting it at 33144.<br /><br />You can also convert a PCM .wav to another PCM .wav approximation of the DPCM.  This is useful for people who make .it/xm/s3m files and want to have dpcm samples that sound like a NES's would.  You can also just load full songs into this to play around (warning, large filesizes take awhile).<br /><br />Compressed .wav formats are not supported, and they will not be in the future most likely.  This includes ADPCM, uLaw, etc.<br /><br /><a href="http://4x86.com/DMC_Editor.exe" class="postlink">you can get it here</a>.<br /><br />Future features: <br />-&lt;33144hz conversion<br />-multiple quality/pitch settings<br />-Graphical DMC wave display (directly editable, copy/cut/paste)<br />-Preview for the current DMC wav at given frequency<br />-The ability to chop up large wav files so they can be played back as DMCs on the NES<br />-Drag 'n Drop functionality <br />-additional filters<br />-bit crushing<br /><br />and a bunch of other stuff that I don't really want to list yet <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br /><br />----------------<br /><br />If you find any bugs with a .wav file (for example, if a .wav causes it to crash or if it's PCM and it whines that this is not a wave file), send me the .wav with a description of what went wrong at rushjet1 (at) 4x86 (dot) com.

<br />
<br />VB handles this by passing things "by reference" - it's a fancy way of saying "pointer."  Try looking up "by reference" in the DLL calling routines and see if that gives you a nudge in the right direction.
<br />
<br />Your program looks awesome - keep up the good work!

<br />I actually spent a couple days on that with another programmer friend helping, and we couldn't get it to work.  Found a precompiled dll and used that.  Made a struct, passed byRef.  That didn't seem to work so I made it an IntPtr and marshalled the memory to send over but that produced identical results.  The program complained that my ratio was not between 1/12 and 12, which it was.  Then I tried compiling the newest version of it but found tons of problems with his Win32 code so I had to fix those.  Finally got it compiled and the program said it checked out (tests passed) but it was 1.4MB and unusable in my code without another windows library in the same directory, then VB.net whined about how this was managed code... so I switched programs to one that is much easier to use and works well <img src="./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" />  I'll be posting the new version today.

<br />
<br /><a href="http://4x86.com/RJDMCv0.05.zip" class="postlink">You can get the new version here</a>.
<br />
<br />Changes from 0.01
<br />
<br />-Changed name to "RJDMC"
<br />-Any .wav input rate is supported and properly conveted to 33144hz
<br />-Drag 'n' Drop is supported
<br />-Added an Edit-&gt;Preferences menu for batch processing
<br />-Allowed opening multiple files for batch processing
<br />-Multiple .wav output rates
<br />
<br />Batch Processing: If you want to process more than one file at once, first go to edit-&gt; preferences and choose your output method (this will not work in "manual" mode as that expects one at a time).  After selecting an option (and a .wav output rate for .WAV output if you want), either drag/drop multiple files onto the application or use the File-&gt;Open dialog and select multiple .wav files.  They will automatically be created in the same folder as the input files with either "&lt;inputname&gt;.dmc" for DMC output or "&lt;inputname&gt;D.wav" for .WAV output.

<br />
<br /><a href="http://4x86.com/RJDMCv0.3.zip" class="postlink">RJDMC v0.30</a>
<br />
<br />It's been awhile since I've officially updated this, so there are a lot of changes (especially behind-the-scenes).
<br />
<br />-Memory use is cut way down (for large files)
<br />-Bit Crushing is implemented (0 is off, 1-19 is varying degrees of bits flipped, and 20 is an inverted waveform).
<br />-Volume control is implemented (volume for the input wave is changed by x%).
<br />-Zoom is implemented on the waveform view--unfortunately it only zooms to the middle now.
<br />-You can highlight parts of the wave in the waveform view but it doesn't do anything. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" />
<br />-Pitch control is done, and playback is at least pretty close to how the NES would handle it, though not exact.
<br />-Opening DMC files is possible now, and you can edit them just like .wav files.
<br />-Several bugs were fixed, most of which most people wouldn't notice <img src="./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" />
<br />
<br />Again, if there are problems, post here or e-mail me with them.  Thanks!
<br />
<br />PS- if you get .net errors, chances are that you need to install the latest version of .net <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />

<br />-Pitch is implemented
<br />-Deleting selection is implemented
<br />-Fixed several bugs related to the highlighting of the window
<br />-Fixed bugs involving space bar triggering controls
<br />-Fixed bugs with lower HZ samples crashing SSRC (small files)
<br />-Implemented Cut, Copy, Paste, Trim, Select All, Delete
<br />
<br />NOTES: 
<br />-Zoom function doesn't work with editing the wave file yet (it acts as if you're zoomed all the way out).
<br />-You can either right click on the wave display or use shortcuts to use the editor functionality.
<br />	-CTRL+V = paste, CTRL+C = copy, CTRL+X = cut, CTRL+T = trim, CTRL+Z = revert, CTRL+A = select all
<br />-"quality" Pitch change right now is a bit mediocre quality-wise.  I might just have lots of copies of each .wav file in memory for small files.
<br />-To use copy, cut, delete, or trim you must have something selected (by dragging the mouse and making a rectangle).  To paste something, you need to click once (without dragging) and a single white line will show up- this is where the info will be pasted.
