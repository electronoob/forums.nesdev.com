<br />Those are my thoughts, anywho...need to get three designers ported over from nesicide(1) before it is implementable.

<br />
<br />About metatiles, I also wrote a level editor for myself, and I wrote it to be at least partially pluggable. The level editor always deals with 2x2 tiles as the "smallest" metatile, since this so naturally fits in with 2 bits of an attribute entry. Beyond that, a specific game plugin is entirely responsible for reading a large 2D array of meta tiles and converting it to its own compression format. I suppose one could come up with some generic way of multiply nesting meta-meta tiles as far as the user pleases (I think Banshaku was working on an idea like this for his editor), but sometimes people use totally different approaches like RLE (or a combination). So I mean maybe NESICIDE could give the user a few "basic" things that would work out of the box, but allow them to write their own plugins to perform customized map compression.
<br />
<br />*edit* it seems like even a plugin system based on 2x2 meta tiles may not be sufficient in all cases, what about games that have variable height and slopes and so forth? It seems like it would be quite a challenge to create a flexible map building system into an IDE. I guess one could still use 2x2 meta tiles but embed the height information within them. Perhaps the plugins could expose customized properties and data for height or other attributes..etc.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I usually say that it's impossible to make a generic enough level editor, as each game has very specific needs. Even though level maps can be divided in two main groups, grid-based and object-based, every game has different requirements.
<br />
<br />Technically you could use a generic editor to place the blocks in a grid and make level maps, that will later be converted to the specific game formats, but what about games with level formats such as the one used in MD/GEN Sonic games, where intermediary blocks are used (the metatiles are used to build larger blocks which are the ones used to build the map)? If you draw freely using only metatiles, without considering the intermediary blocks, the data converter will generate an insane number of intermediary blocks, killing the whole purpose of the compression scheme.
<br />
<br />This is why I decided to use GIMP to edit my maps, I can set the grid to the size of any of the blocks (16x16, 32x32, 64x64, 128x128, 256x256) so that I can draw each area with the precision I need. If I need to make a very specific ramp, I'll use the 16x16 blocks, but when I need long flat grass sections I can probably copy a whole 256x256 chunk.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Of course, the problem with drawing with roughly screen-sized chunks, such as your 256x256, is that it makes the maps more repetitive. In fact, some sections in 1-1 of Super Mario Land for Game Boy were so repetitive that the first time I played, I thought I was in a looping level similar to 4-4 and 7-4 of the original Super Mario Bros. I think that's why Sonic 2 for Genesis used chunks no larger than 128x128.

I don't remember anyone complaining about Sonic 1 or Megaman X.<br /><br />It's common sense that you shouldn't reuse very characteristic blocks, like Somari does... If you play through all 3 acts of Green Hill in that game you'll get that looping sensation several times. Then again, I think it only has 32 256x256 blocks for all 3 acts, so they *have* to reuse them a lot.<br /><br />Anyway, it makes sense to reuse long floor sections, a sky with clouds, some generic ramps... There are several sections in Sonic games that are generic enough to be repeated without drawing attention. Plus, you can make the same block look different by placing objects (such as spikes) on it.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">I think that's why Sonic 2 for Genesis used chunks no larger than 128x128.</div>
<br />Yeah, Sonic games other than 1 and CD used 128x128 blocks, but I still don't think Sonic 1 and Sonic CD felt repetitive at all, specially since many times you just run through the repeated blocks without paying much attention.
<br />
<br />I know that such big blocks wouldn't work well for all kinds of games, but for a platformer with large levels I can't think of a better way than using huge blocks. How else would you have a 32768x2048-pixel large stage on the NES? I plan on making some levels that big.

<br />
<br />I'm not an OSX user but if what you are looking for is the following:
<br />
<br />You need Qt, SDL [audio] and OpenGL [gfx]
<br />
<br />then that is probably about all I can offer.  My other suggestion would be to ask on #nesicide on freenode.net.
<br />
<br />The project does not currently have distributable binaries.
