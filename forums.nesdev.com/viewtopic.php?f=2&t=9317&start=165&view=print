Use () for parentheses in expressions like you do in C and so on.<br /><br />Therefore: If you use MagicKit, please learn it at first!! (Otherwise, don't use it.

Easier to just switch to [] to avoid ambiguity for the parser. Meanwhile, it creates ambiguity for everyone used to the normal way. (Yes, Kasumi has flip-flopped on this issue.)<br /><br />Should you continue to want to use nesasm (I do), be aware that (indirect),y is also affected and needs braces.</div>Yes, this is how it work. I also think it just makes more sense to use [] for indirection like C does.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">tokumaru wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">It shouldn't have its own syntax to begin with... 6502 assembly has a established syntax, and there's no reason to mess with it except to confuse programmers. I guess it's OK for assemblers to offer macros and other special features with differentiated syntax, but there's absolutely no reason to mess with the basic language.</div>I disagree...well, I suppose you could make a option to change this if people prefer () for indirection like the standard 6502 assembly does, in case this is what you want.<br /><br />MagicKit also uses &lt; for zero page addressing, a feature I like but I don't think it is a standard 6502 assembly code.

I'm guessing it's just bankswitching but the 4 layers in the clouds looks pretty good IMO, I can see how some might consider it too busy but it looks a lot better on the NES/TV than the youtube video.

Thus, they all loop every 8 ticks ( 32/4 = 24/3 = 16/2 = 8/1 = 8 ).<br /><br />The FME-7 with 1k CHR banking makes this not terribly wasteful. It's taking up half of 8 x 1k banks. Though, there seem to be a lot of &quot;filler&quot; tiles marking unused space in the CHR. The character animations are mostly done with 1k CHR paging as well.

Otherwise you can use FME-7 (mapper 69) and it's CPU cycle counter instead of a scanline counter.  The RAMBO-1 is the most versatile MMC3 like mapper with 8 full 1K chr banks and a counter that is switchable between scanlines and CPU cycles.  Beware though, the RAMBO-1 fires IRQs a few (~5 dots I thinks) later than MMC3.  It also lacks WRAM but I don't think exdeath cares, and in reality we can add WRAM if we'd like.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />You know what my wife just suggested when she saw the 4-layer demo? That it would make a good fighting game! The text box could become health bars (character portraits should be sprites though, because of palette limitations), and the parallax would look amazing as the fighters moved back and forth.<br /><br />These layering effects are really cool, but hard to put in a platformer, so a fighting game might be the best way to showcase a number of interesting landscapes. And since you're not using any sprites for the effect, they're all free for some decent-sized sprites. Just make sure that the flickering doesn't get too annoying.<br /><br />Also, fighting games are easy to program, since they don't have to deal with level maps (you wouldn't even have to deal with realtime name table updates, since arenas that are 2 screens wide are more than enough). The difficult part is drawing all the sprite animations!

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />IMO, there's an acceptable amount of flicker between &quot;flicker-free&quot; and &quot;flicker from hell&quot;. There's a pirate Street fighter III for the NES with incredibly colorful characters that aren't particularly small, and the flickering is not very annoying IMO.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WFHCVWOYIQ" class="postlink">Here's a video</a> of the game, but that's just so you know what game I'm talking about, because YouTube videos don't run at 60fps so you can't see how the flickering really is.<br /><br />The <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1roOb9HkSpk" class="postlink">TMNT fighting game for the NES</a> is another example of good sprite usage, but they aren't as colorful as in Street Fighter (each fighter uses a single palette here). This game even has parallax effects in the background too.
