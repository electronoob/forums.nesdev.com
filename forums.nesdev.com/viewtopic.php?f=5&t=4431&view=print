<br />
<br />Well, supposedly, Kapersky Anti-Virus is better than the Kapersky Firewall.
<br />
<br />However, I had thought Norton actually scanned for a 'trojan' it refered to as "Kapersky".
<br />
<br />*confused*
<br />
<br />Maybe I am just being paranoid again. :/

<br />People keep using that gross hardware, whose manufacturers refuse to port their drivers to anything other than that gross operating system.
<br />
<br />People keep using those gross stores, which sell only hardware loaded with a gross operating system.
<br />
<br />People keep using that gross shopping method of trying before you buy, which works only in gross stores.
<br />
<br />Besides, even on *BSD and *Linux, trojans can still screw with the entire contents of your home directory unless you make a separate <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FreeBSD_jail" class="postlink">jail</a> for each application. I haven't yet seen a GUI to manage dozens of jails on a home PC running any operating system.

<br />I'm of the kind that uses virtual machines for potentially unsafe tasks (such as testing new software) and formats his HD upon any signs of infection. This means I do use a lightweight free AV, just to monitor things. I don't expect it to protect or fix anything.

<br />Do you say that because you're experimented about that subject, or just because you hear it somewhere else ? Because I'm very unexperimented about that, so I'd like to know if anti-viruses are really worthless or not. My machine gets slower and slower at booting for no apparent reason, and my anti-virus only detects YY-CHR as a "virus" (this is a known bug tough) which is the reason I removed stupid avast and installed something else less annoying after a while.

<br />
<br />This one on windows is a pain since it could be for many reason.  One of them could be a virus,  another one could be a service that have an issue and takes more time to load. Or it could be a new installed driver that cause havoc. Sometime it can be caused because your harddrive is fragmented.  Another cause could be because your registry file is getting bigger and it get the system slower.
<br />
<br />The speed issue is not always because of a virus, this is one of many possibilities.  In that case, since I usually don't have much time to troubleshoot it, the easier (and lazy) way it to do a clean install if you don't have many program on it.  Sometime the troubleshooting is not worth the time invested.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />In my experience, slowdowns are not worth the trouble. EVERY windows machine slows down with use, as you constantly install and remove sotware, pieces are always left behind. Plus the occasional spyware/adware, that you can never seem to fully get rid of.
<br />
<br />I say that anti-virus are useless for fixing your system. They don't make miracles! They may even remove the malicious software from your machine, but if things are seriously damaged, they simply can't fix it. Once Windows is damaged, it's gone, it will never be the same.
<br />
<br />When you combine all of that, it's no wonder that ALL Windows machines eventually become slow and bugged. That's the nature of Windows. The only way to keep your system clean and fast, is by reinstalling it when it's in bad shape. No software will help you there (in fact, many packages that promise to clean your system up slow it down even more, because of all the processes running in the background, file scanning, automatic updates and all that crap).
<br />
<br />There are programs out there that allow you to start with the original windows installation and add stuff to it. This means that you can make a windows installation customized for your machine, with all your programs and all tour drivers. Once you have a disc like that, you can reset your system to it's best shape in a matter of minutes. Just make sure you have a partition in your Hard Disk reserved exclusively for the system stuff, and keep all your data in other disks/partitions.
<br />
<br />That's my opinion at least, and this is what I do. It's just a suggestion for the people that have slowdowns and other problems: make your drive C easily formattable!
