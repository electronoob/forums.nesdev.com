Is that unique to 65816.<br /><br />Please lecture me on processors.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />8bit bus saves quite some money, let less PCB realestate, less IO used so smaller cheaper packages... but you have half the bandwidth, unless clock is pushed twice as high which is not always an option. That is why oldass PCI GFX cards have 64 or 128bit DRAM buses, to move a ton of data within available clock speeds.<br /><br />The ALU is 16bit and that is what makes up the bitness. I recently read the Z80 has a 4bit ALU, technically it 4bits, even though it cannot do any 4bit operations (maybe BCD squeezes in some way...) and can do some 16bit stuff too.

Like the Z80, the 68000 accesses memory only once every four cycles, allowing it to share unified memory with other devices on the bus. So just as with the Z80 compared to the 6502, you need to clock 68000 twice as fast to keep the same memory bandwidth.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Z80 has 4 cycles only for instruction fetches, and only because it pushes a refresh cycle in, other accesses are 3 cycles long, 1 cycle of them is also for sampling the !WAIT signal.<br />On 68K all bus accesses are 4 cycles unless !DTACK assertion is extended, then the access is extended until !DTACK is deasserted.<br />The bus is driven during all those cycles, if you want to use &quot;dead&quot; cycles you need bus switches.

But parallel ports exist for a reason: sometimes frequency is limited. Expansion from 1 to 4 bits per cycle is why the SD memory card format added extra data pins compared to the SPI-style MMC it was based on.
