I'd prefer a soundtrack that plays more in the background and is overall softer.<br /><br />The boss battle theme and the title screen music can be harder, but the level theme is the one that plays most of the time and it shouldn't get on people's nerves after a while.<br /><br />When I say softer, think about the soundtrack of &quot;Paperboy&quot; on the NES.<br />Or maybe the main theme of &quot;Kung Fu&quot; (minus the fact that this soundtrack is effectively a tune that is only six seconds long.)<br /><br />Unfortunately, I'm lacking the knowledge to tell him exactly <em>what</em> he needs to change so that it sounds softer.<br />That's why I'm asking here: Would anybody be willing to listen to the FamiTracker file and tell me what it is that makes the song dominant and what can be done against it?<br />(The soundtrack is not for the public yet, so I cannot just link it here.)<br /><br />I would be really grateful if anybody could help me here.
