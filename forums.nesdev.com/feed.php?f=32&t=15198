I personally use 16x16 metatiles for level data and collision. I store the screens using RLE and decompress when the player enters the room (which may be 2 scrolling screens or 1 screen). <br /><br />The decompression routine updates both VRAM *and* a metatile buffer in RAM, which I later use for collision. The size of this buffer is pretty manageable in the built-in 2Kb of RAM. I've never run out of RAM.<br /><br />16x16 metatiles are mapped. They reuse the same patterns once and again so I can have the variety I need while keeping the room size small.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=6012">na_th_an</a> — Tue Dec 13, 2016 5:22 am</p><hr />

You're correct, I meant to put bytes. I suppose I mean UOROM then. The only real difference is the routing of one address line anyway. That's a bummer about the compo cart, and the bank capacity though.

<div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"><br />while Metroid switches mirroring schemes between areas to have flexibility with the shape of the room.<br /></div><br /><br />There's a lot of unlocked potential in the switching approach of Metroid. False corridor stops, enable/disable scroll events, switch flip flop trigs (through player positioning, events, timing). Downside: more code and testing needed.<br /><br />I think the biggest flaw with non-scrolling or h-scrolling only is how jumping from one v-level to the next may cause frustration if not carefully planned in the level design. Same goes for enemy placement, naturally. Otherwise, i can't think of anything else at the moment. It may also be easier to plan out player vs enemy interaction; someting battle kid shows.  <br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"><br />(because why can't a humanoid character do these things anyway??)<br /></div><br />I think this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qe3Lylagoog" class="postlink">metroid commercial</a> demonstrates a case of the opposite. If the acrobatic skill set is unlikely, there may not be a need for a story other than 'supernatural powerup'. But that is maybe not what you're going after. <br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"><br />It would be interesting to create a good metroid-like where the character does not actually directly have a weapon. I like the idea of weapons being a product of the environment, or limited use, in support of that idea.<br /></div><br /><br />For what it's worth, i really like this idea! Especially the &quot;product of the environment&quot; part.

I thought a little more about storage. I think uncompressed nametables might actually be okay, if I use all 16 UNROM banks. <br /><br />Each nametable is 1024KB, or 4 pages. For each nametable (from here on, a <strong>room</strong>) I need to store some metadata, so the total structure for each room can be:<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">* Nametable data (960 bytes)<br />* Attribute data (64 bytes)<br />* Room ID (2 bytes)<br />* Object List: for (max_objects = 30):<br />* --&gt;Object type (byte)<br />* --&gt;Object data/flags (byte)<br />* --&gt;Object X pos (byte)<br />* --&gt;Object Y pos (byte)<br />* World Map X pos (byte)<br />* World Map Y pos (byte)</div><br /><br />With this, each room is 1280 bytes. That means I can fit 25 rooms per UNROM bank, with 768 bytes to spare. So, that means I can dedicate a large chunk of UNROM banks to just storing level data. With 12 banks, I can fit 300 rooms.<br /><br />Alternatively, I could store only 28 rows of a 30 row nametable. That would make me lose the top 2 rows of tiles, but I would be able to fit an entire level structure within 1024KB, which would allow my UNROM banks to be very neatly divided (32 rooms per bank). Losing the upper 16px isn't a big deal, as many TVs overscan most of it anyway. I may go with this in the end.<br /><br />A 100% dense 20 x 15 room world map would be the max size, but many games of this type don't fill 100% of a square area. So, I think I can create a sufficiently large world this way using just uncompressed nametables. If I felt super-constrained, I could A) implement the most basic compression, or B) use UNROM_512 for 32 banks, like Battle Kid does. Bankable CHR could let me do some simple environmental animation without eating NMI time, which would be appealing.<br /><br />I may be able to forego the Room ID, but as I plan on having over 256 rooms I'd like to ensure I can access rooms without relying on a lookup table.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=5314">mikejmoffitt</a> — Tue Dec 06, 2016 1:35 pm</p><hr />

I'll be sure to be more prudent about palette choices going forwards.<br /><br />I have a few game design decisions as well: Do I want to have many non-scrolling 32x30 tile rooms, 64x30 two-screen H scrolling rooms, 32x60 two-screen V scrolling rooms, or longer variants? The advantages to the first three is that the room has only to be drawn once, on room entry. I know rainwarrior's Lizard uses the second approach, of small two-screen H scrolling sections, while Metroid switches mirroring schemes between areas to have flexibility with the shape of the room. Of course, one tiny advantage of the 32x30 room choice is that the player's position only needs to be 8 bits. I may change my fixed point positioning format to a 12.4 format, from the 8q8 I have now.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=5314">mikejmoffitt</a> — Mon Dec 05, 2016 2:05 pm</p><hr />

I have trouble justifying things like wall-jumping, sliding, or somersaulting as a powerup (because why can't a humanoid character do these things anyway??) but I would still favor including them because good gameplay &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; story-justifiable powerups. Definitely these sorts of things add a lot to exploration, regardless. <br /><br />It would be interesting to create a good metroid-like where the character does not actually directly have a weapon. I like the idea of weapons being a product of the environment, or limited use, in support of that idea. I am presently also working on <a href="https://github.com/mikejmoffitt/LICS" class="postlink">Lyle in Cube Sector's Genesis / MD port</a>, which (up until later in the game) the player's only means of attacking are throwing chunks of the environment at enemies. <br /><br />As for the grays, I did almost all of my testing on my NES, where they were more distinguishable. In YY-CHR's palette they are distinguished too. I noticed that they are kind of crap in the emulator, but didn't bother to change it in time, in favor of more pressing things. I probably won't use much of the environment I drew for this, as it's just stuff I came up with for proof of functionality.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=5314">mikejmoffitt</a> — Mon Dec 05, 2016 1:16 pm</p><hr />

Sprite reminds me of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Xlq1p3pZAA" class="postlink">Demon Sword</a> (it's the &quot;angled&quot; running stance -- look at the legs).<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3">koitsu</a> — Mon Dec 05, 2016 12:12 pm</p><hr />

CHR-RAM utilization is not too bad right now. Obviously the player is facing some serious fragmentation, but I can deal with that without too much trouble. For 12 unique animation frames, many of them larger than 16x32, I think the utilization of the space is reasonable.<br /><br /><img src="http://i.imgur.com/ecFT0nk.png" alt="Image" /><p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=5314">mikejmoffitt</a> — Mon Dec 05, 2016 9:05 am</p><hr />
