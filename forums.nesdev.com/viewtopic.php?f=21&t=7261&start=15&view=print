I tried a couple of methods to clip the OOG colors. One was a hue-preserving clip (if B is clipped but R and G are left alone, then the hue shifts), but the color lost its brilliance. I'd have to set this simulation back up to remember exactly what happened, but it definitely looked a lot better than just a simple RGB clip, even if the saturation was wrong. I tried a hue and saturation preserving clip, and the color kept its brilliance, but the luminance was obviously wrong compared to the rest of the colors.<br /><br />No matter what I did, I couldn't get the palette to look &quot;right&quot; unless I cranked the generator's brightness way down, which would require me cranking my display's brightness up to cancel it out. This is basically the same as displaying a color that is brighter than 1.0, which gave me the idea that I'd never be able to attain the exact palette I want, unless LCD technology changed somehow.<br /><br />Then again, maybe I think it's impossible because I was completely alone when trying to solve this.

However, I'm taking a different approach, and I'm converting YIQ to various CIE color spaces (using the physical red, green, and blue as defined by the NTSC specification), and coverting from CIE to RGB. When I say I want a palette that looks like my TV, I'm being absolutely serious, and I'm doing all I can to figure out how to <em>correctly</em> simulate a CRT's colors. The only issue is that sRGB's gamut is absolutely piss-poor by comparison, since a <em>lot</em> of colors wind up out of range unless you drop the saturation or contrast down.<br /><br />Also, if you view source, please excuse how sloppy my coding was. :S

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />You're saying that the gamut of a device that merely has a brighter picture is wider? I think you might be saying that if you treat 1.0,1.0,1.0 as white in sRGB, you get a poorer gamut than if you treat say 0.5,0.5,0.5 as white. A TV basically does the latter it seems you're saying, so that it can do super-saturated colors, but also compensates by making the screen really bright so that 0.5 white appears bright. But everything in the sRGB world treats 1,1,1 as white, so you can't just crank up your monitor's brightness and use 0.5,0.5,0.5 as white, since nothing else will and thus the screen will blind you, save for your emulator. Throw in scanline emulation and you darken the picture more, prompting even more need to crank up the monitor's brightness.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />So my current project is to try to simulate the three colored phosphors in CIELuv. The FCC specification specifies three coordinates on the CIE color space. Red, green, and blue are defined as (.67, .33), (.21, .71), and (.14, .08).<br /><br />I chose CIELuv because I read somewhere that CIELab is geared more towards colored surfaces and dyes, and CIELuv is a better approximation of colored lights specifically (i.e., CRT displays).<br /><br />I've converted the R, G, and B points (called &quot;primaries&quot;) to their CIELuv equivalents. What I do is I convert YIQ to RGB, and then starting at the white point (FCC defines it as C, (.3101, .3161), but SMPTE defines it as D65 (.3127, .3290)), I treat the primaries as vectors that radiate from the white point, and I use R, G, and B from YIQ-&gt;RGB as magnitudes for the vectors. The resulting point is the color I need, but this is where I get stuck.<br /><br />I <em>was</em> translating the result point back into CIEXYZ, and then converting XYZ -&gt; outputRGB (where outputRGB is the color being sent to the screen), and this gave me some pretty nifty results (you can see it in the HTML5 app I made), but this creates some problems.<br /><br />The main one: I need to be able to apply gamma curves to R, G, and B. If I apply it to outputRGB's R, G, and B, I get an approximation, but it isn't exactly &quot;correct&quot;, because what I <em>should</em> be doing is applying the gamma curve to the &quot;simulated&quot; R, G, and B before converting it to outputRGB. I can't apply the curves to YIQ-&gt;RGB's R, G, and B, because those represent the difference between white and color, so instead of the individual channels getting darker, they just become unsaturated, and that's not correct.<br /><br />Another observation I've made; it seems that the NES's palette is hue-shifted. If I just use a raw YIQ-&gt;RGB conversion, the hues are off by a little bit. Color x8 indeed has the colorburst hue, but on my television, it's yellow-orange instead. Indeed, other colors end up wrong too, but by shifting the hues over just a fraction, everything looks correct again. Why? I don't know. Maybe televisions shift the hues themselves, maybe the NES somehow shifts the colorburst phase by a fraction of a clock (unlikely).<br /><br />Finally, most of the NES's colors are out of the sRGB gamut used by computers. I'm unsure of a good method to perform gamut-mapping; what I do right now is I desaturate the color until its R, G, and B components are all in range, and although the luminance is correct, the color itself ends up washed out.<br /><br />I doubt anyone here knows about anything I've just said, but if anyone else is more familiar with gamuts, and color spaces, and all sorts of this stuff, I would really appreciate your input.

I mean, if you don't mind having a palette that dark, go ahead and knock yourself out.</div><br />How the hell did that even work? o_O</div><br />It's only RGB that's limited to 0-255. CRT televisions don't operate on RGB, they operate on YIQ, which can produce colors that are WAY out of RGB range, and because this is analog electronics we're talking about, there's no problem with it. (Phosphors don't have limits like that; they just shine brighter and brighter the more energy you give to them)<br /><br />So far, I've been treating YIQ like a color wheel, because that's basically what it is. I = sin(hue), Q = cos(hue). So, I figured out which &quot;angle&quot; is supposed to be colorburst, and lo and behold, if you do a simple YIQ-&gt;RGB conversion, you get that pale green color I keep talking about. However, if you do YIQ-&gt;CIELuv-&gt;RGB, you get yellow. So I'm not crazy, maybe the NES actually does output a pale green color for color 8, and it's just the physics of colored lights mixing together (or the definition of the NTSC color primaries) that turns it into yellow.<br /><br />So I set color x8 as colorburst, and computed the rest of the hues from there. I haven't uploaded my latest version of the app yet, but I believe the hue setting should be spot on now.<br /><br />--------------------------------------------------<br /><br />I noticed a quirk. I went into my TV's settings and turned the saturation all the way down (my TV is capable of completely disregarding colorburst). Every 4th color (starting with color x4) has a slightly lighter luminance than the other colors. This is completely without chroma (as far as I know), so the luminance signals for those colors is slightly lighter? Does this happen for anyone else?<br /><br />---------------------------------------------------<br /><br />NTSC buffs, please help me with this one. I know that the hue of the picture is relative to the hue of the colorburst. Is the saturation of the colors relative to the amplitude of the colorburst too?<br /><br />What happens if the colorburst has a DC offset? Does that have any effect on the colors? I hypothesized that a positive DC offset on the colorburst would lighten the colors near the colorburst hue, and darken the colors near its complement, however I don't know if this actually happens.<br /><br />The reason I'm thinking about this is because the NES <em>may</em> have a DC bias on its colorburst signal. If it does, and it affects the output, then I need to take it into account.
