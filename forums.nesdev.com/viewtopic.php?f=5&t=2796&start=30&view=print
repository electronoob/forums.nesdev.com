<br />seriously, though... your last point about merging even and odd fields doesn't hold water with the SMS, MD, or Neo-Geo, because the artifacting doesn't <strong>change</strong> between fields, which was exactly my point.

<br />
<br />As for my opinion, comparing SMS to NES is like comparing apples to oranges, they're too different (but in the same generation) to be able to factually tell which one is better. Many SMS games are technically impossible on an non-MMC5 NES, while many stock NES games are technically impossible on the SMS.
<br />
<br />On the non technical part, if I had to choose between an NES with SMB3, Castlevania 3, Megaman 3, or an SMS with Sonic, Wonderboy 3, Alex Kidd in Miracle World, I wouldn't be able to make up my mind.

But C.Cowell states that it is just like the NES, wich is lazy.
<br />
<br />And the guy that compares SMS screenshot to NES screenshots claims the SMS is clearly supperior, while I don't see any significant differences between the quality of SMS graphics and NES graphics. Also, screenshots don't show much, graphics are a lot about animation. It's just like Sony wich show screenshots of pre-rendered cutsces of PS2/3 games before the release of the console and say "yah, our graphics will look like that".
<br />
<br />Also, I really like working with luminance/chromance instead of RGB. The day I'll code a game wich uses RGB, I'll do everything trough a conversion from luminance/chromance values. This allow linear fade in and fade out easier to do (add/substract instead of multiply/divide), and make palette swap easier to do (keep the same luminance levels but change the chromance). Additionally, it allows cool effects if you change the chromance quickly (like in FF1 when you enter in the menu).

<br />True about the SMS, but Genesis does what Nintendon't: 80 sprites, 20 sprites per scanline, 320 sprite pixels per scanline, sprites up to 32px by 32px.

<br />But that was expected, since the Genesis/Megadrive belongs to the following generation! If they hadn't improved that, Sega would have died much earlier! =)
<br />
<br />About the screenshots comparing the NES and the SMS, I think they say something. They show that no system is clearly superior to the other. Some games look much better on the SMS, while other look much better on the NES.
<br />
<br />The system where games run on is just a part of what makes them. There are many other aspects that will define the final quality of a game. The talent of the people who make it will define how well the platform is used.
<br />
<br />I, for example, know nothing about the PS3. Even if I'm presented with the most expensive development kit, I won't be able to make anything good for it. I'd probably make a much better NES game!
<br />
<br />What I mean is that both systems have advantages and disadvantages (and that will be true even if you compare systems from different generations), but the true quality of the games is defined by the people who make them. Even if you have good programmers/artists/musicians/whatever, if they do a half-assed job, it won't be good.
<br />
<br />I really think that talent and effort are more important than the system itself. Realistically, of course... It's a bit unfair to compare a NES and a PS3, but you get the point.

(Not that I agree with most of the arguments at SMS Power and am whining) IMO it's Sega's own fault that FC holds a candle to the MK-III. It's also Sega's fault for focusing their software efforts on poor inhouse arcade ports and not more Phantasy Stars or even Psycho Foxes.

<br />
<br />The real Z80 does not have ld a,(hl+) instructions, only the gameboy has them.  Instead, you'd use the block copy instructions, LDI or LDIR.  LDI transfers (hl) to (de), increments hl and de, then decrements bc by one.  It sets the overflow flag once BC =0.  Alternatively, there's the LDIR instruction which repeatedly copies bytes and decreases BC until BC=0.  Oddly enough, an unrolled loop of LDI instructions followed by a backwards jump is actually faster than the LDIR instruction.
<br />
<br />There's also decrement versions, LDD and LDDR.  And even Compare versions, like CPI, CPD, CPIR, CPDR, etc. But I usually use those instructions just to increment HL and decrement BC and set flags, the comparison is just an unused side effect.

<br />I love how SMS fans always use (at least) these two games (Phantasy Star <span style="text-decoration: underline">is</span> great, though) as their systems' shining moments, when Psycho Fox was also released on the NES with another name, and both versions are pretty awful anyway, IMO.

<br />I think comparing SNES sound and Genesis sound (on a technical standpoint) would be hilarous. The difference between the SMS and the NES seems rather slight, as are the main differences between the Genesis and the SNES (graphically).
<br />Built in rotation rocks, but you HAVE to use mode 7 to get built in rotation, and mode 7 has plenty of other stupid limitations (256 tiles available on total, all tiles use 8 bits per pixels wasting HALF of VRAM just for tiles, only one BG available, etc...).
<br />However, when it comes to sound, in all objectivity, the SNES isn't comparable to the Genesis simply by the very large difference between both soundchips' nature. Personally I found Genesis games happed to sound a lot worse than NES, but that's just personal. I think well used square waves beats repetitive low quality digitalised instuments that are always the same.
