Contra/Gyrzor is probably near the borderline. Were Rush'n'Attack is run'n'gun while something like Mega Man is platformer. There is no clean cut, its all sliding scales, with various levels of game play elements being combined. Where each of us draws the line will differ.

I don't think so. The main difference between the arcade and NES versions of Contra (aside from improved controls in the latter) is that the NES version is much longer with every stage expanded, where in the arcade version they merely servered as simple gauntlets taking you to the next boss battle. Several individual stages on the NES were just different parts of a single stage on arcade. On the other hand, the over-the-shoulder &quot;3D&quot; stages were much bigger in the arcade, built sort of like little mazes.<br /><br />Of course that also results in more actual platforming in the NES version, but the arcade definitely had platforming - including the iconic vertically scrolling stage which has you constantly jumping up from platform to platform. Even if no other stage has bottomless pits, there are platforms aplenty.<br /><br />The much more simple explanation (Occam's Razor, really) for why people identify Contra as a platformer is because of the control scheme, which is simply straight up classic platform controls. And the same goes for Metal Slug, for that matter, and most other run'n'gun games in that vein.<br />I don't have a problem classifying Contra as a platform game for this reason, but if that's the only term you're using, most people will of course think of the classic Mario-style platformer focused almost entirely on platforming. If you talk about &quot;run 'n gun&quot; people will be more likely to know what you're talking about. Except that term also tends to cover the classic top-down Ikari Warriors/Commando style shooters. Genres are fun like that.<br /><br />There are also plenty of games that are much more &quot;borderline&quot;, too. Games like Ghosts 'n Goblins and Castlevania are definitely platform games too, and very far from the Contra style run 'n gun formula. But again they are much more action and combat focused than your typical cutesy Mario platformer. I think the fact that the platform game concept allows so much variation is exactly why it's not a bad thing that we are seeing a lot of them made.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=7819">Sumez</a> — Mon May 29, 2017 8:28 am</p><hr />

Trying to swing back to topic:<br /><br />I've read that some versions of <em>Contra</em> had pits, such as the NES version, and others didn't. Wikipedia's article states that the pits near the end of stage 1 aren't in the arcade version. Because addition of pits pushes it more toward platformer, perhaps this difference is part of the confusion about the extent to which run-and-gun overlaps platformers. People who grew up with <em>Contra</em> for NES consider the run-and-gun genre to incorporate those platforming elements seen in <em>Contra</em> for NES, whereas those who grew up with <em>Contra</em> arcade and <em>Metal Slug</em> might not.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=9">tepples</a> — Mon May 29, 2017 7:55 am</p><hr />

The original Java 6502 emulator used by 6502BDD did its best to run at 1Mhz for Accuracy, to which I made a mod.

There is also another type of 6502 system build in with the emulator that has 6445( 48? I think it, something like that ) text CRT controller chip<br />4.) BRK is a standard 6502 opcode and hence it is from an emulators point of view, safe to do. However in 99.9% of cases you don't want to BRK and since RAM is filled with 00 in the emulator if I get a wrong index into my &quot;On X&quot; code then it will end up in BRK land, to which the emulator will just happily enter a infinite BRK loop. So I have this to say as soon as it happens, stop.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=8250">Oziphantom</a> — Sun May 28, 2017 11:23 pm</p><hr />
