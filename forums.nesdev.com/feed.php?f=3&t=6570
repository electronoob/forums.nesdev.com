And yeah, I think I would be able to write out a memory address access log without a problem.  That's pretty cool.  I didn't know that it was even OK to stop only the CPU and not stop the PPU as well - although I hadn't really even thought about it until now. Thanks for the suggestions!

But if one could use an access log such as that created by some FCEU variants to discern used from unused bytes, it would work for a test ROM not specifically designed to test power-up state. Besides, a well-behaved test ROM could just specify that zeroes in unused RAM locations are part of its output.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=9">tepples</a> — Thu Jul 08, 2010 6:31 am</p><hr />

Your best bet is probably to look for expected output over the serial connection, by way of hacking the test roms to output some known value to it, and running them in sequence.<br /><br />Graphical glitches that are not detectable by the roms are probably best handled with actual eyeball tests, possibly ones driven by a special cased state machine to test, say, the PPU in isolation. Those can make it a lot easier to get the exact cycle timing for certain events verified, and speed tests up by an order of magnitude or so if they involve the bus.<br /><br />Brute force RAM testing in particular is best done with a state machine that mimics the 6502's bus behavior, but with the address/data stream and pass/fail logic done at full bus speed, rather than the 1/10th or worse you'll get with an assembly loop.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=8">ReaperSMS</a> — Tue Jul 06, 2010 11:55 pm</p><hr />

Hello all,<br /><br />My emu is becoming extremely complex. Especially now that I've implemented a bunch of mappers.  The code is very modular but there's always the chance that making a change in one module will drastically affect another - and not necessarily in a good way.<br /><br />Whenever I make a fairly large number of changes to my design (especially if it's a PPU/CPU core change/fix) I very tediously go through and test a subset of all of the games that I have available and ensure that I didn't break one that was previously working.  As you can imagine this takes a considerable amount of time....and to be honest, it's starting to wear me out. <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />Can any of you suggest a better way of verifying my emu? Keep in my that I have the fairly unique case that my emu is implemented in hardware (FPGA) not software.  Right now I have the ability to load ROMs over a UART port on the board.  I could at a minimum write a script to load the various ROMs one after another...but is there a way to automatically have a script determine that the game actually "worked" without me have to look at (and/or play) each one?<br /><br />Maybe I shouldn't even worry about actual games right now...maybe just the available CPU/PPU test ROMs (e.g. Blargg's)?<br /><br />Any suggestions would be very much appreciated.<br /><br />Thanks!<br /><br />Jonathon<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3962">jwdonal</a> — Tue Jul 06, 2010 11:25 pm</p><hr />
