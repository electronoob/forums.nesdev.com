Since I'm using a rgb chip the game won't display graphics unless I remove that.  Any help is greatly appreciated.

Now the debugger will break every time the game writes to $2001. The instruction that writes to $2001 is usually STA, but could be STX or STY too (or in some obscure cases maybe something else). Then it's up to you to find out how that value got loaded to A (or X, or Y) register. Often it's just an LDA/LDX/LDY instruction somewhere before the STA/STX/STY.<br /><br />In Nintendulator the process is very similar.

Now the famicom version of just breed runs great in rgb.<br /><br />In the fceux debugger I entered E0AE in PC and hit &quot;seek to pc&quot;.  The command there matched what dwedit says needs to be changed.  Then I checked &quot;rom offsets&quot; and it lists where it is in the rom.  I wish I knew before you can get the rom offeset in a debugger.<br /><br />Also I'm curious, how do you know it only sets the upper 3 bits once?

If battles ever use any color-emphasis effects (don't know whether they use them or not), you might need to track down those too.<br /><br />Also (unrelated), Final Fantasy I uses color emphasis bits for color effects when you enter/exit the menu, and before battles.

So the only way to know for sure is set nestopia to rgb mode and play the game and see if it ever loses picture.

The megaman 4 minus infinity romhack the brightman stage (lightbulb dude) has colour emphasis on every part of the screen except a horizontal bar where megaman is.  I'm looking to disable that if possible.<br /><br />In the debugger the code I think is this:<br /><br />&quot;0FC288:99 00 20  STA $2000,Y @ $2001 = #$E8'<br /><br />Except, I really don't know nes asm well enough to know how to change that e8 to 08.<br /><br />Here's the link to the hack:<br /><br /><a href="http://www.romhacking.net/hacks/910/" class="postlink">http://www.romhacking.net/hacks/910/</a><br /><br />Version I have is probably newer but the fix should be the same if it gets worked out.

The first scene in just breed when you're walking around the town at night time is color emphasis it's a perfect example.  Try the megaman 4 minus infinity hack the brightman stage has both regular and colour emphasis modes displaying on the screen at the same time.  With a composite ppu the emphasis parts of the screen look darker, with my rgb ppu they turn solid white.<br /><br />Here's a lazy emulator snapshot demonstration.  Composite ppu showing color emphasis:<br /><br /><img src="http://i.imgur.com/Xt4yzBK.jpg" alt="Image" /><br /><br />How it looks on my system using a rgb ppu<br /><br /><img src="http://i.imgur.com/yCD40xp.jpg" alt="Image" /><br /><br />Otherwise the game looks fine:<br /><br /><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDPJCJValDs" class="postlink">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDPJCJValDs</a><br /><br />A few romhacks like to &quot;show off&quot; and use funky ppu effects.  If such a list gets made we should include romhacks as well.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />RGB emphasis can be set separately for each of the components, so it's possible to end with a blue tint (I think there's a game that uses this to make translucent water).<br /><br />But yeah, as far as I know that's a PPU register and not something that can be modified from outside (it should affect the signal the PPU itself generates), so messing with the PCB shouldn't cause emphasis to kick in. Probably something else screwed up.
