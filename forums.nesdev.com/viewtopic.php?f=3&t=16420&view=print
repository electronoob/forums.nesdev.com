Performing either a reset, or power off/on, all 8 pages are available. When closing out the emulator completely, it only creates a 32kb file, thus, when running the emulator again, it will only have the first 4 pages of wram saved.<br /><br />I toyed around with the ines header, to try to make it display the wram as 64kb. I was able to make the information window of fceux display the battery wram, as 65####(sorry I don't remember the exact number) and once I performed my tests, it still outputs 32kb.<br /><br />This also happens with the other 2 major nes emulators, Nestopia &amp; Nintendulator.<br /><br />I will have a link here, directing those to my test rom. The ines header I believe is incorrect with its wram, but as I stated I adjusted it and still got 32kb.<br /><br />Thank you to any that can help out!<br /><br /><a href="http://acmlm.kafuka.org/uploader/get.php?id=5248" class="postlink">http://acmlm.kafuka.org/uploader/get.php?id=5248</a>

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />MMC5 with 64kb of WRAM is a theoretical possibility that was never exploited by Nintendo. Actually released games are either 8k, 16k or 32k. Emulators needs not to support 64kb WRAM in order to fully support the library of commercially released NES/Famicom games. If you write your game and require 64kb WRAM with MMC5, then some emus will have to be modified to support your game.<br /><br />The default behaviour with ETROM, the board that supports 16k WRAM with two 8k chips (as well as the behaviour used by all commercially released games using ETROM boards) is having one chip battery backed and the other not. It is however possible to change solder pads in order to have both chips battery backed. If a board was made to support 64k WRAM, it fully makes sense to &quot;default&quot; to one 32k chip battery backed and the second chip not.

Then I feel it's very misleading to implement into the emulators, &quot;theoretical&quot; options for the user to select, only to have said emulator not actually output the file size you want. That's my frustration and confusion, I've got people online telling me these emulators can, and your reply, paraphrasing, they can't and have to be modified.<br /><br />Why bother implement the 64kb wram option at all? <br /><br />No need for further discussion, basically it doesn't exist. I'll just go on with using the additional 32kb on top of my other 32kb, as vanilla prg-ram that is non saveable.

I have absolutely no idea about which emulator supports what.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">Then I feel it's very misleading to implement into the emulators, &quot;theoretical&quot; options for the user to select, only to have said emulator not actually output the file size you want.</div><br />The problem is that the original iNES header only has a way to specify whether WRAM is battery-backed. There is NO way to specify how many WRAM is present on the cartridge, nor, if there is two chips, which chip is battery backed and which isn't. So emulators had to rely to heuristics in order to determine the quantify of WRAM and how much is battery backed before the NES 2.0 header was released. Now that the header is released, many emulators barely supports it, most emulators will ignore it and rely on old heuristics. Some will always simulate the maximum WRAM (that is 64k), if this does not break games that would rely on WRAM bank mirroring, then it's fine and I do not see why they would NOT implement this.<br /><br />So basically using super-accurate emulators like Nestopia and Nintendulators that uses NES 2.0 headers is your best option. I think FCEU is simple to modify (someone modified it to support dendy square-wave duty cycle inversion) so it should be doable to modify it to support NES 2.0 headers and/or 64kb WRAM entierely battery backed if you really need that.<br /><br />If there is already a version of FCEU which uses NES 2.0 headers, then my whole post should be ignored and that version should be used. I'm sorry I can't be more helpful but I really don't know which emulators supports or do not support which weird/non-standard features.

Because the attitude I've seen on some emulators' issue trackers is that they're more willing to fix compatibility with current and forthcoming games than theoretical issues that don't noticeably affect compatibility with actual NES programs.<br /><br />You keep mentioning &quot;romantic&quot;. Does this have anything to do with a hack of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romance_of_the_Three_Kingdoms_(video_game_series)" class="postlink">Koei's <em>Romance of the Three Kingdoms</em></a>?

I just thought this was available to use, over the years of studying and working with the mmc5 mapper.<br /><br />I get intrigued by things that haven't been done or used. So the idea of having 64kb wram, and have it saves, is very intriguing.

If you have that, and the emu supports NES 2.0 headers, and it outputs only a 32k .sav file, then I guess it's a bug in the emulator, and you should report it to the author(s). But it seems weird 3 unrelated emulators would have the same bug...
