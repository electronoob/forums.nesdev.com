(A full frame takes about 30 seconds)<br />In comparison, I usually got to about 400hz on the JS version with similar tracing (~10 minutes for a frame).<br /><br />Obviously, this is all based on Quietust's work, which is based on the Visual 6502 - so all credits to him and the folks behind the Visual 6502.  <br />I simply converted the JS code to C++, with relatively few modifications (aside a few optimizations).<br /><br />This version adds a few features: log the trace to a file, select nodes to trace from a list, load/save state to files, load/save ram content<br />It also emulates the full $0000-$2FFF memory range for the PPU.<br />It's still missing some things, though - most notably, I did not port the code that draws/animates the actual chip yet.<br /><br />Code: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://github.com/SourMesen/VisualNes/">https://github.com/SourMesen/VisualNes/</a><!-- m --><br />Windows binary: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.mesen.ca/VisualNes.zip">http://www.mesen.ca/VisualNes.zip</a><!-- m --><br />Linux: There is a makefile included, it seems to run fine on Mono from the few tests I did.<br /><br />Hopefully this is useful for someone else!<br />Let me know if you find any issues.<br /><br />EDIT: Replaced download link with a statically linked version (no longer requires the VC2015 runtime to be installed to run)<br /><br /><div class="attachtitle">Attachment:</div><div class="attachcontent">

Some things -<br /><br />The &quot;next scanline&quot; button jumps a whole scanline instead of to the beginning of the next scanline. This goes for all the &quot;next x&quot; buttons. I don't really mind, but it differs from the JS &quot;next x&quot; buttons.<br /><br />Secondary OAM isn't viewable.<br /><br />Some sprite values get destroyed during the first cycles of running, but this might be intentional? The JS version does it too.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Yea, I'm aware of the difference between the next pixel/scanline buttons - the way I have it now was just easier to implement, so I was lazy.  In the end, I feel like having both options available would probably be best (at least for the scanline/frame options)<br /><br />I don't think the secondary OAM is visible on the JS version, either?  Adding this would probably require finding out which nodes correspond to the secondary OAM (this is how the code works for the sprite &amp; palette ram). I don't know enough about chips to ever hope to find this information myself, though.<br /><br />The sprite ram being overridden is because of the &quot;Program&quot; (bottom left) that's loaded up by default - it makes some writes to registers and fills up some of the sprite ram with preset values.  You can erase the program and then reset to make sure it doesn't do that.<br /><br />Also, I just finished porting some more features over - the chip is now visible and you can highlight nodes/zoom/pan it.<br />-Double-click to zoom in, right click to zoom out (or use the mouse wheel for both)<br />-Click and drag to pan<br />-Click on a node to get its name/highlight, Shift-click to select a group of connected nodes<br /><br />I updated the download link in the first post.<br /><br /><div class="attachtitle">Attachment:</div><div class="attachcontent">

Still far from being done, though.<br />Technically, couldn't I just connect some of the data/address buses (not quite sure which!) and have a working &quot;NES&quot;?<br />If I go that far, wouldn't it be simple to run NROM test roms &amp; get a &quot;perfect&quot; trace of what happens?<br /><br />It still runs at ~5000Hz even with both chips in the simulation, so it should be able to run about 1 frame per minute.  An hour for a second, that's not too bad considering most test roms take only a second or 2 to complete.

I'd imagine the cores are working properly if this much works.

If you could somehow speed up the code 10 times over by splitting the workload onto multiple cores and optimizing the code, and then use a more recent CPU than mine, you might be down to around 1/50th of the speed.  So.. I guess somewhere around 2040 we might be able to get it done!<br /><br />For now I'm mostly interested in using this to compare execution traces with Mesen for the couple of tests it still doesn't pass and try to figure out why.

And I always thought it would be cool to see Visual 2A03 and 2C02 combined.<br /><br />Seems that it doesn't like loading 16kB NES files, but that's not a big problem (easily solved by making it 32kB).<br /><br />From what I understand, the NES CPU and PPU has several different clock alignment possibilities determined at power-on (or is it reset?).  Maybe that's something that could be included in this?  I'm not saying that I need it myself though, or that I know what would be involved exactly.
