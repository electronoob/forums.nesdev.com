I understand that it may be a bit uncomfortable to reverse-engineer clumsy arcade cabinets and that you may need strong torches and other cave exploration equipment (if you don't have the mainboard laying on your table). Still, there are only a handful of unknown pins left, so how difficult could it be to get them tracked down?<br /><br />For reference, here's the complete list of currently known pins (and guessed/unknown pins with question marks):<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Solder side&nbsp; &nbsp;Component side<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A&nbsp; &nbsp; B<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; GND - 50 - VCC&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ;\<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; GND - 49 - VCC&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ;<br />&nbsp; CPU.48&nbsp; &nbsp;?&nbsp; MCK 21M - 48 - /RESET&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; WRAM.8&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;;<br />&nbsp; WRAM.7 ? ??&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;- 47 - SYSCLK&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; WRAM.6&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;;<br />&nbsp; WRAM.7 ? ??&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;- 46 -&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ??

<!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AkX8OEvTKT7CdFJ4WjJrOG01bklQbmZ4eDFRbTZQNmc#gid=0">https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc ... QNmc#gid=0</a><!-- m --> - I've kept only two question marks on VPP/GND pins, both related to the connection on the MAINBOARD side (not on the cartridge side):<br />For VPP on Pin 1/2/18/19.B: it would be interesting if does have some 0 ohm connection to VCC (or maybe 1 or 2 ohms in case it goes through a inductor).<br />For GND on Pin 17.B: this pin isn't following the arrangement of the other supply pins, ie. if it is NOT wired to GND on the mainboard side then it might be something else (like a muted audio input, a cartridge_connected signal, or some other unused/reserved/special stuff).<br /><br /><strong>Solder Side (A)</strong> This is still having some question marks. Though I've removed the ones on the INST.ROM pins (mark's specs on A7 and A12 looked a bit messy to be, but since hyarion has verified A7, I will trust that nintendo did really have them arranged like that).<br />The MCK and /IRQ have been already confirmed here: <!-- l --><a class="postlink-local" href="http://forums.nesdev.com/viewtopic.php?p=118290#p118290">viewtopic.php?p=118290#p118290</a><!-- l --> (but hyarion did strike-out the text, so dunno of they are still confirmed or not).<br />The PA0, PA2, PA4, PA6, /PARD pins are guessed; based on the PA1,PA3,PA5,PA7,/PAWR pin arrangement on Side B.<br /><br /><strong>Missing Pins</strong> Pin 47.A, 46.A, 45.A, 46.B aren't assigned yet. But they might correspond to SNES pins REFRESH, EXPAND, SOUND-L and SOUND-R.<br />I would assume that one of them is really REFRESH (WRAM.7).<br />SOUND-L/R might be also supported, but might be hard to verify since the signals might get routed through capacitors before reaching the audio amplifier - on the other hand, such capacitor routing would be hinting on audio stuff.<br />And EXPAND, well, that would go to the SNES expansion port, which doesn't exist in the NSS. So the fourth unknown pin might be NC, or it might have completely different function as in SNES.<br /><br /><strong>Slot Selection</strong> this might exceed to what-pin-is-there question. But then, the NSS is a multicart system, so it would be pointless to reverse-engineer the NSS pinouts without understanding the slot selection.<br />Current theory is that Pin 5.A <em>might</em> be a /SLOTn select signal (actually three signals, /SLOT1, /SLOT2, /SLOT3, for the three cartridge slots respectively). However that theory is solely based on mark's description, saying that Pin 5.A is <em>&quot;from NSS&quot;</em> (don't ask why <em>that</em> made me think that it might be a slot selection signal, I was just guessing - and somewhere, such a signal should exist).<br /><br />And finally, it would be important to know how that supposed /SLOTn signal is used. Juding from PCB photos, it looks same/similar as in Playchoice 10, ie. probably using the 74xx367 chip to disable the SNES and INSTROM and PROM chipselect signals when the cartridge slot isn't used.<br /><br />EDIT/PS. The white 2x50 pin connector on the NSS cartridges does look as if might be some standard component. On photos it does even look as if there might be some part number on that connectors. Only problem is that Nintendo has covered that part number underneath of a sticker. Just a suggestion for another expert hacking project: Somebody try removing that sticker.

Both are obsolete as of a<br />few years ago, but they're just shrouded 0.1&quot; headers.<br /></div><br /><br />All pins are same on all three cartridge slots, except three pins have separate signals per slot:<br />A47: PROM./CE_# = PROM chip enable for slot 1,2,3 (can be directly wired to PROM)<br />B10: INST./CE_# = INST ROM chip enable for slot 1,2,3 (can be directly wired to EPROM)<br />A5: /SNES_# = SNES enable for slot 1,2,3 (must by manually ORed with /ROMSEL (and other pins if needed))<br /><br />For the supply pins, B17 is actually GND (including on mainboard side). And for VCC pins: The Z80 supply (for INST ROM and PROM) is always powered, and the SNES supply can be switched off (via Q1 transistor on mainboard) (whatever that is good for, it might save some energy during menu selections, but during Demo mode the SNES supply needs to be certainly enabled).<br /><br />About the /SNES_# signal (pin A5), basically this should be ORed with the SNES read/write/chip_select signals. Instead of using an OR gate, the NSS cartridges are usually doing this by using 74HC367 tri-state buffer (similar as PC10 carts), this chip could switch up to 6 signals (which may be actually required for some cartridges), but in normal NSS carts it is merely switching one single signal (/ROMSEL); wired as so: Pin1=/SNES_#, Pin2=/ROMSEL_IN (from NSS), Pin3=/ROMSEL_OUT (to cartridge; with pull-up resistor), all other inputs are GNDed, and all other outputs are NC.<br /><br />Aside from /ROMSEL, it may be also required to switch /RD, /WR, /PARD, /PAWR, and  in opposite direction: /IRQ. Together with the /ROMSEL signal, this could be done neatly via the six channels of the 74HC367 chip (plus six pull-up resistors).<br />/RD and /WR would be required for cartridges that do memory mapping without /ROMSEL=LOW (that would be: SRAM in HiROM carts, the NSS DIP switch cartridges, and several SNES coprocessor carts which do leave /ROMSEL completely unused).<br />/PARD and /PAWR would be needed only for making a 100% functional SNES adaptor (though in practice there aren't any SNES cartridges known to use that signals).<br />/IRQ might be required for some cartridges. If the cartridges do disable /IRQ upon /RESET, and if they do produce open-collector /IRQ signals then it wouldn't be required to disable /IRQ on deselected cartridges. But I've no idea if the existing SNES cartridges are really working like so (or maybe some do, and others don't). So it may be better to switch /IRQ by passing it through the 74HC367 (in opposite direction as the other signals, and with a pull-up resistor on the <em>cartridge</em> side (the resistor would be required for cartridges that <em>do</em> use open-collector /IRQ outputs) (for the NSS mainboard side: there should be already a pull-up resistor present, at least it's like so on SNES mainboards).<br /><br />EDIT: A fully functional NSS-to-SNES-cartridge adaptor would also require a CIC chip (as a few SNES cartridges with special protections won't work if the 'console' doesn't output the correct CIC signals).<br />Accordingly, the adaptor would also need something that generates the 3.072MHz CIC clock signal (on a real SNES that would be 24.576MHz/8 coming from APU) (on the NSS adaptor it would require a separate oscillator, or if accuracy doesn't matter, then one might get away with 21.xxxMHz PAL/NTSC master clock divided by 7 (or dirtier: divided by 8)).<br />Unless there should be another way to get those protected cartridges to work (maybe by simply wiring CIC clock to VCC or GND, or by feeding it only a few dozen of CIC clks after reset, so it could initialize itself, but would never reach the point where the protection could do something harmful).
