		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I did a quick search on the forum and couldn't find the information about these.  Maybe the way I searched was wrong so  I wrote the most possible case in the current subject on purpose to help other people that may search for the same information in the future.
<br />
<br />I may not need "to know" since I will be mostly programming game on the nes but knowdlege is power so I would like to know more about their meaning since I will do my dev cart soon (already removed the chip on my first tentative board).
<br />
<br />What I understand already (I think) is the A pin allow you to set an address of the data you want to fetch.  Once set, it will be available on the D pins.
<br />
<br />VCC seems to be related about voltage but I'm not sure. I want to know the meaning of this one and the meaning of the acronym VCC.
<br />
<br />Then you have CE, which I have no idea what it means. Sometime it's written with a / in front of it: does it have the same meaning in that case?
<br />
<br />If there is other common pin notation that I forgot to mention and you decide to explain about it, I will be more than happy to hear it.
<br />
<br />Like always, thanks again for the information, I always appreciate it.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />VCC = Voltage Collector Collector. It's 5V applied here to power the chip.
<br />
<br />CE = Chip Enable. When the chip is enabled, data is available to be read or written on specified adress. When not enabled, the chip ignores everything and this allow mulitple chips to be connected on the same bus (RAM, ROM, registers, etc...)
<br />
<br />Any sighal with a / in front of is means that it's active low. /CE means that a 0V volatge implies a chip enable, +5V voltage for chip disablle. CE is the other way arround.

<br />
<br />I did another quick check on the wiki and there is a few extra I missed regarding  the standard eproms:
<br />
<br />- PGM -&gt; It could be the pin used for programming the chip?
<br />- OE   -&gt; No idea what it means. I saw it on CHR rom too but as RD
<br />- NC   -&gt; Maybe means not used?
<br />- GND -&gt; Ground, name say it all
<br />- VPP   -&gt; hmm. seems similar to VCC but don't know the difference

<br />
<br />PGM - yes, it puts in programming mode.
<br />OE - output enable, chip puts data out.  RAM and Flash also has WE - write enable, chip takes data in
<br />NC - not connected, inside the chip the pin isn't connected to anything
<br />GND - yeah ground, also sometimes called VSS
<br />VPP - programming voltage, generally something like 12V I think, depends on the chip.  Only used when writing to EPROM.
