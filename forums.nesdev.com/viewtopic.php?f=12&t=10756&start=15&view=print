So a solid white screen in that emulator appears as #f8f8f8 (very slightly gray), not #ffffff. They no doubt chose to use a 16-bit surface anyway because it was marginally faster than copying a 32-bit surface. But comparing that slight inaccuracy against the flat-out completely wrong gamma is kind of silly. Images are blindingly bright if you don't correct the gamma difference between a TV and LCD monitor.<br /><br />Fun side-tangent: SNES brightness register is a luminance adjust, not an RGB555 adjust. As such, it's technically possible to choose from more than 32768 color shades. But good luck computing exactly how many (certainly there's bound to be a lot of overlap between the different luma settings.)

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />&gt; But seriously, how do actual, correctly calibrated TVs differ noticeably from the sRGB color space that computer monitor interfaces tend to assume?<br /><br />Assuming you have a correctly calibrated monitor at 50%+ brightness (eg Spyder ICC profile on an IPS panel), the left is what the image looks like if you assume 1:1 RGB, and the right is what the image looks like on your standard CRT TV.<br /><br /><img src="http://i.imgur.com/sgsrtxW.png" alt="Image" /> <img src="http://i.imgur.com/kxXqctR.png" alt="Image" /><br /><br /><img src="http://i.imgur.com/Is2Bpnf.png" alt="Image" /> <img src="http://i.imgur.com/QheO401.png" alt="Image" /><br /><br />If your monitor settings are too far off, then the left may look more like your TV. But with a properly calibrated desktop monitor, the left looks like the image is covered in a hazy fog. The right is clear and shows the vibrancy of colors you see on a CRT TV. At least, the right matches my PVM-2030 RGB monitor at stock settings much closer.<br /><br />&gt; ...It works in analog domain ? The &quot;Shadow/Highlight&quot; function in MD is something that works in analog domain.<br /><br />It is most likely analog, yes. That's the only way I have to explain the psychotic behavior of luma=0. Instead of being absolute black, it's like 99% black. Much like how you mute a cheap old TV and you can still barely hear it if you put your ears closer. It was cheaper to just reuse the existing analog scaler and hammer the value down as much as possible than to have an actual switch to completely disable the signal.

People have listened to compressed-to-hell music for so long that they have grown to like the artifacts it causes.<br /><br />People have been using overly washed out palettes in SNES emulators for the past 16 years, so it's what people are used to seeing.<br /><br />The gamma-adjusted version can obscure some really dark details, too. But they tend to be on TVs as well. It's a bit like how I used to cheat in Ultima Online by maxing out my monitor brightness inside caves, rather than using night vision items. You were supposed to not be able to see things that well, but with insane brightness, you could see all of the details anyway.<br /><br />It's an option in my emulator, so you can use either mode. Obviously, as that's how I took those screenshots.

It's like the color range was reduced by 99%. You can't really simulate it in 24-bit color mode. I output the colors at 48-bit (16-bits per channel), which ends up displayed on my monitor at 30-bit (10-bits per channel.)<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">Could it be due to the fact that the image can be brighter on a TV (as far as I know)?</div><br /><br />You can do that, sure. But I am matching the colors of my stock PVM-2030, and before that, a regular CRT I had previously (don't remember the brand.)<br /><br />I'm frankly stunned that anyone can look at the left images and like them more (the left outside area looks like broad daylight during a thunderstorm), but to each their own.<br /><br />Back when my workplace had CRTs still, the right did look way too dark, but that was due to the brightness being turned down pretty low. For which I also have a brightness adjustment setting.

This is a $1300 professional monitor, which was factory calibrated, and I've had it for about a year now. It's been long enough that I <em>should</em> recalibrate it, but I do not own a Spyder.<br /><br />The gamma correction is also based on standard gamma differences between PC LCDs and CRT TVs.<br /><br />But anyway, you have full control over this gamma adjustment, and additional brightness/contrast/gamma/hue/saturation adjustment settings. So you can tweak the colors to match your own TV by hand if you like. It's well worth the effort.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Side-note - I have an 8-bit IPS RGB LCD panel. When I am adjusting levels of R,G,B, and the gamma curve, etc. are these adjustments done in the 8-bit digital domain, or are they done with finer granularity? If it is the former, it seems like everything other than output-RGB = input-RGB would decrease usable color depth. I know often the &quot;contrast&quot; control works this way and will result in details being missing / at levels out of proportion with surrounding details.
