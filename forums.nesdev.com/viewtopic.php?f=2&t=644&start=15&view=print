<br />Yes, I think some documentation for us newbies would be awesome!  I tried following joker21's "Programming that 8-bit beast of power, the NES," and didn't end up getting past nametables.  I feel it's pretty tough to follow along.  According to the top of the document, that was originally in a zip file with some other docs/tools.  His site seems to not be there anymore, as well.
<br />
<br />I'm gonna give that simulator that you posted a shot, tokumaru.  I can't seem to find anything that I feel comfortable with experimenting in, so maybe this will really help.  Thanks <img src="./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" />

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I find that simulator pretty handy. Everytime I need to test a standalone routine I run to it. It's very usefull when programming math routines like division or multiplication, also when programming data compression/decompression routines... well, routines that are hardware independent, and can be tested separetely from the rest of the code.
<br />
<br />In fact, I use that simulator for everything. I do all my nesdev'ing with that tool, as it can export assembled binary data. I think it is a very good learning tool. It helps you understand all the aspects of the processor, since you can view the memory, the stack, the registers, the flags without having to compile a ROM for this. You can see how each instruction affects the flags, and other stuff that is hard to get just by reading. It is a very good "do it yourself" kind of tool.
<br />
<br />But I don't think adding PPU emulation to the simulator will be any good, because it would not be accurate at all if it didn't emulate ALL aspects of the PPU and then it wouldn't be a simulator anymore, but a NES emulator with strong debugging tools.
<br />
<br />It would be great to have an accurate emulator able to assemble your code and run it on the fly, with debugging features for the CPU and the PPU. But that is just a lot to dream about....

<br />
<br />Even if bullying and banning visitors in #nesdev for asking too simple questions might be highly entertaining to you, that doesn't compensate for the damage it does. And this didn't just apply to the IRC channel. It is not my intent to nag about 6 years old stuff, but if you claim elitist attitudes were your (partial) reason for leaving the nesdev community, then you seem to have a highly selective memory.

If you base your entire personal opinion of me on my IRC behaviour, then there's absolutely nothing I can do to "redeem" myself, because that's all of me you've seen.  I won't lose any sleep over it, and nor will you.  Such is an endless loop...
<br />
<br />Not to take focus away from me, but MickoZ is in the same boat I am with #nesdev -- banned+kicked+removed "for life", due to his behaviour in the channel.  I've pointed him to this thread, so he might chime in with some historic references of his own (he likely has a very different memory of things than I do).  But I sincerely don't want to make this thread into some flame fest (it's starting to border on that, but I think all of our intentions are good or neutral -- we're just discussing and reminiscing... if it gets worse, I assume Memblers will lock this thread).
<br />
<br />Anyways, I'm beating a dead horse.
<br />
<br />For what it's worth, you're one of the few who <strong>doesn't</strong> present that attitude I mentioned.  You were always a lot of fun to talk to, and you're enthusiastic in the way you communicate -- you didn't communicate like an emotionless robot, and you use emoticons to express your tone of intent.  I think, generally speaking, the community could use more of that, but like my post on PocketHeaven, my opinion is just that of one man.  I'm no more or less important than anyone else.
<br />
<br />I honestly would've hoped that most would've read my list and concluded "Okay, so it's his own experience... but what matters in the end is that he's happier doing what he does now than what he did before".
<br />
<br />I'm generally happier solely playing NES/FC games (rather than focusing on development), but I'd be lying if I said I "miss" anything on IRC.  I'd also be lying if I said I didn't miss some of the challenges of console dev; but I have other challenges in my life now which take precidence.  All the (very few) true friends I made from NES development work I still talk to on a daily basis; as for the rest, well, I have my memories -- good and bad.  Life goes on, and I'm getting too old for this kind-of thing...

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Well... it wasn't my intent to invalidate your own experience. I suppose I got upset when seeing this story being told i a way I didn't consider truthful.
<br />
<br />My first impression of you wasn't very positive. But when I got to know you better, I came to like you, and consider you a friend of mine. But at the time you left, you obviously weren't very happy and were taking it out on others. You kept bullying newcomers to the #nesdev channel, often using racist language. One of these I met IRL and knew to be a nice guy, if somewhat "teenagered". I tried to defend you and your behavior, but found myself disliking it more and more each day. In the end, I gave up trying to defend you and did my best to ridicule you instead. The last time we talked on IRC, it wasn't on very good terms. That was 5-6 years ago and we haven't talked since. Which I kind of regret now. Last impressions also last, even when they shouldn't.
<br />
<br />I can relate to what you say about being happier just playing NES games than doing development. That's mainly what I do nowadays as well. But fortunately, it hasn't made me feel the same way about the time I spent learning what goes on behind the scenes in my favourite games. I'd almost say I enjoy them more when knowing how things like the cool vertical parallax scrolling in the Mega Man 2 intro really works. I also like to read these forums from time to time, talk to old friends and help others test their stuff and improve their code, just by proposing the wild ideas I no longer care to try out myself. 
<br />
<br />I've also started (a very slow) development of a puzzle game which I hope to make for the NES. Besides thinking a lot about what elements to add to make the gameplay more fun, work on it mainly consists of learning to draw nice low-color graphics, something I've always wanted to do but never took the time to learn when all my focus was on becoming a "l33t" coder. It might never see the light of day since it competes with lots of other hobbies I have nowadays, but for once I'm focusing on designing a fun game experience rather than just pushing hardware limits.
<br />
<br />Even if I suspect your note about famitracker was directed at me, I'll be the first to second it. I've kept wanting to see a better tool for making NES music developed from scratch ever since I definitely discontinued my own tracker 5 years ago, even planning different formats and user interfaces myself, but never finding the motivation to start a new project to maintain, since I've realized I now value spending time doing non-computer related stuff with other people IRL much more than getting credit from people I might never meet. So I'm relieved to see someone else take the responsibility I stopped enjoying. There's still a few areas where NT2 does a better job (namely melodic dpcm) but I'm hoping jsr will fix these soon. 
<br />
<br />Well, I've been mostly rambling on about myself for the last few paragraphs. But last I'd like to say that I AM glad to hear you're happier nowadays then you were back then. Like you said, that's what really matters. I didn't mean to put you down, but I felt I had to give my side of the story.
<br />
<br />And btw, if you'd still like to see your FF2j intro work on a real NES, I could check out your source and see if I can figure out what the bugs are.

I didn't know crap about programming when I came here. Now I do, though. I try to be newbie friendly, because I really think it sucks when people tell you you don't know anything, and it makes you feel like crap. And when people tell you you don't know anything, they don't think about how that will make you feel, because somehow, they were never newbies, they were never treated that way, and it IRRATATES ME! How the heck did everyone figure all this out!? Everyone knows about how many cycles the cpu blah blah blah scanlines blah blah megahertz blah blah, and I just don't get it!

<br />
<br />But sometimes, beginners try to advance too quickly, and telling them that is a task for the more experienced. If someone that never programmed before, that so far has only used the computer to write documnts in MS Word and to navigate the net, pops out from nowhere wanting to program a full-featured RPG for the NES, someone has to tell them it doesn't quite work like this.
<br />
<br />It's just wrong to say "You're a stupid idiot, you'll never accomplish that!". But it's OK to say "Look, this is a little too much for you right now. Why don't you try something simpler?".
<br />
<br />I can say that because when I started programming I had such BIG projects but could never finish them. I never got to finish any of them, 'cause I was trying to move to fast. Today I know that I could never had finished them anyway, with the knowledge I had. The sad thing is that now that I can think of ways to implement all the aspects of a game in my head, I lack the time to actually do anything. =(
<br />
<br />The thing is: If someone doesn't know X, he can't go and try to do XYZ. He has to learn X, then Y, than Z. And nobody can help that person through some sort of shortcut, as there will be many important things the person would have learnt by trial and error.
<br />
<br />I mean, a tic-tac-toe kinda game may seem unoriginal and pretty boring to program (and even play), but the concepts one will get from doing that will be of MUCH help when working on larger projects. A person can learn about movement based on controller reading, restriction of movement (simple collision detection), basic animation, simple maps, by working on a simpler game... but these are all essential concepts needed for larger games.
<br />
<br />I don't think people in this board mistreat newbies/begginers. The people here are pretty helpfull, and much more decent than the ones we can find on larger forums/boards around the net. In many other places people are so extreme with beginners, and here they are very forgiving.
<br />
<br />The same questions are posted here over and over and there is always an answer for them. Some other places would ban someone that asked a repeated question for a while. I don't think this place is bad at all when it comes to respect for beginners.

Doing something for someone who doesn't want to understand (but acts like it) benefits neither party. On the other hand, good teaching materials go a long way even if someone doesn't want to understand how something works.
<br />
<br />I was a newbie to NES development a couple of years ago, but I'm the type to give a good effort at understanding something before I ask for help. Each time I approach some new aspect of the NES, I gather materials and then slowly experiment. If I rushed things I would build only the illusion of understanding based on coincidences, that would eventually collapse. I guess when I started programming in C about 12 years ago I was rushing things, trying to make scrolling games. I look at that code now and shudder. :)

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Yeah, I always loved platform games and that was the first thing I ever attempted to code, when I first made contact with the world of programming, about 9 years ago. Code from that times does look pretty bad, indeed!
<br />
<br />I'm not as old in programming as you are blargg, but I think we were both learning it before there was THE internet. Back then, we were pretty much on our own. Back then, there was no place to cry for help. That may have contributed to the "experiment before asking help" attitude, as there was no way to get the help.
<br />
<br />So, I guess there may be a new generation of newbies now, that aren't as eager for learning as they are for results. If some of them could cut'n paste everything, I bet they would.
<br />
<br />But what good is it to have a "finished" game full of glitches because you didn't understand half of the stuff you did/used in the game? If it ever gets finished, 'cause most of the times it doesn't. If you take a look around the NES scene, even the most experienced coders haven't completed a game, and the ones that did, did simpler games. It's no picnic to finish a full-featured game on your own. And it gets even harder if you have a "real world" life, with jobs, relationships... AND if you are a newbie.
<br />
<br />Enthusiasm is not a bad thing, that's for sure, but people have to be aware of their limitations as begginers, and at the same time make efforts to learn and break free form them, as knowledge comes from studying and hard work, not from plain reading or simply from time.
<br />
<br />Rushing things can never result in quality software.

<br />PS. is it just me or are we getting a little bit offtopic here? =P
