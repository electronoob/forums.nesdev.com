<br />Right now, most likely not (in its current state) -- although it seems to run the fastest in linux (compared to Windows and OSX currently). Though right now chris is in the process of importing all of the inspectors, and all of the debuggers are running full steam. Once the debuggers are all ported over (he's done 4 so far), we will toggle the callbacks so that if a debugger is not visible, it will not eat CPU. Aside from that, we run profillers to try to trim down on execution time. If, after we get those debugger toggles in it still runs too slow for you, by all means let us know and we'll work to get things sped up. A celeron processor is pretty weak (regardless of how new it is) due to it's itty bitty cache, but it should be at least usably fast (again, after the debugger toggle logic gets added). If not, we'll have more work to do <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />

<br />
<br />Yup, the project file is one big XML, all data is expressed inside of CDATA tags. No compression is currently being used. At some point I may have an option in project properties to compress the entire xml file with gzip, but right now it's all open. Although in the near future I plan on publishing the XML specs, I can go ahead and give you the current specs if you'd like (though they will change a bit as we continue development).

<br />
<br />Honestly the idea is to have the development of games in nesicide2 be centralized in the community, and revision control in-ide is planned. I plan on getting the nesicide.net domain (and hopefully we can get control of nesicide.com since he knows the guy) and setting up a back-end system on there to host, upload, share, download, rate, etc project files. That way the IDE, while usable offline, can be tightly integrated, and people using it will not feel so isolated. I'll have options for protecting the source code via encryption and pass phrases, but this is further down the line of course.
<br />
<br />Having said that, the way the project subsystem is coded, it wouldn't be hard to support external files.
<br />
<br />[edit]
<br />Also I don't see a reason why we couldn't explicitly add support for revision control systems internally in the future as well. I just want to make this software as internally accessible as possible.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Although we wont have time to put in any graphics designers before the xmas eve cutoff, we will be able to handle graphics. I have already added support for importing binary files, and am currently working on the CHR-ROM bank designer. Basically under the Project/Graphics/ section of the project browser, there will be a folder called "Banks", which you can add banks. You then double-click said bank to open up the bank designer. In this designer, you will be able to import binary data files. In the future you will also be able to add items from the graphics designers (and yes, these designers will have convenience functionality to automatically add a bank and/or add itself to a bank if the user wants it to).
<br />
<br />CHR-ROM banks cannot be declared in the source code because the graphics banks must be already completely assembled to allow preprocessor directives that can get the bank number, as well as offsets into said banks for named resources.

<br />
<br />Anyone can download the source from <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://gitorious.org/nesicide">http://gitorious.org/nesicide</a><!-- m --> and build it (dev libs for QT and SDL are required). The x-mas version was delayed we still need some kind of installers for linux to be able to release a n00b-friendly package.

<br />Yep nesicide(1) had binary import for palette/tile/nametable but it was just flat binary.  Intent was to extend it to popular picture formats (.bmp, .png) but never got there.  
<br />
<br />nesicide(2) needs to have the designers implemented to be able to have something to import *to*.  The designers are something I keep putting off and putting off [having waaay too much fun with the emulator/debugger side of things right now] but will have to get around to eventually so that I can completely bring over nesicide(1) functionality and sunset it.
<br />
<br />Can someone point me to a description of the "nlist" [?] file format or what assemblers generate these?  I'm at the point where I am ready to tie in assembler symbol tables to the code browser.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Er, sorry about that. I later browsed the rest of the thread in more detail, and I thought I noticed that bitmap import was already a requested feature. I didn't want to make the conversation redundant.
<br />
<br />I've found it really useful in my graphics editor to allow importing of a 256x240 bitmap. It assumes the bitmap in question follows NES graphics constraints (regardless of color depth---it just counts unique colors within the bitmap), and then proceeds to build a palette, pattern table (eliminates duplicates, reports an error if &gt; 256), attribute table and name table. If you're in sprite mode, it builds a bogus attribute table with an attribute for every 8x8 tile so you can build meta sprites instead of backgrounds (I don't support 8x16 yet...).   If the bitmap to import violates any constraint, an error is reported. I was going to suggest in the Art Showcase thread that a bunch of people pool their ideas and come up with a new open source project but, then I remembered NESICIDE and thought that feature would be really cool in a comprehensive development IDE.
