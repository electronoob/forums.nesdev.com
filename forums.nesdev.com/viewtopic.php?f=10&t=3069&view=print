<br />
<br />Since I started here  I've used the .db style format for all my level data.  However, my recent project is quite big and doing this .db format has become quite a headache to manage.  I'm always getting confused on whats going on where after while.  I've spoke (well typed) with Tokumaru a bit and I believe it's time I started looking into writing my own level editor.  While I use C a lot, I've never attempted a level editor before and am having some issues getting started.  Any thoughts, ideas, possible graphic libraries I should use, etc to get me started would greatly be appreciated.

<br />
<br />It's main drawback that I see is that it only supports grid backgrounds, and thus you can't easily include sprites in your level design. And of course the fact that it only runs in DOS at low-resolution. 
<br />
<br />But depending on your project, these drawbacks may or may not matter to you. Developing grand tools for a project often results in having no time for the project itself. So before starting, you should ask yourself if the gain compared to using an existing tool is really worth the effort.

<br />I'd suggest using either wxWidgets or the Allegro library. Both are portable between Windows and *n?x. Or you could make a level editor inside the game engine that saves to SRAM.

<br />That'd be tough, because you'll not be able to handle movement with the light gun... It could work if you could shoot buttons for options, and shoot source and target places for movement. Yeah, I think you might have something there.
<br />
<br />The thing with the light gun is that you can only check if it shot a white pixel or not. So, whenever you expect the user/player to shoot something, you have to place white squares for each thing that can possibly be hit (or do a sort of binary search and get rid of groups of things at a time).
<br />
<br />But yeah, I guess it could work, depending on how you design the interface.

<br />
<br />No offense people, but I keep hearing ideas like these every now then, and I consider them the most misplaced effort there is. Cross-development is the way to go for just about any console. Sure, doing a tool for the NES will always give you some coding experience, but designing a good game engine for the NES's limitations is already quite a challenge in itself, and you'd better not waste your time designing your development tools around these limitations as well.
<br />
<br />Take some time to learn a widget API instead. In the long run, it will both save you lots of time and open up lots of more possibilities for your tool. And on top of that, knowing a widely used widget API willl fit nicer into your resume than having made a tool for console emulators.

Everyone uses a different level format for their games, because each engine is a different engine. Some people need speed, some people need huge levels (making use of weird compression schemes), some need both... Some scroll in both directions, other are side scrollers, and all of that has an impact on the format of the level.<br /><br />So, there is no way for "the ultimate level editor" to be prepared for the designs of every game programmer. I don't see any other way for this to work, other than the editor saving everything using a format that's easy to understand and work with, so that the programmer himself can code converters to the desired format.<br /><br />I'd like to hear some of your ideas on the ideal level editor, though, as this subject really interests me.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">Cross-development is the way to go for just about any console.

I think this is a completelly valid way to code an editor. Graphical limitations will hardly get in the way, as the level is supposed to be displayed on that same system.

<br />Not all NES programmers program anything else, and that would be a waste of time for them if all they want to do is NES games. For them, coding the editors with 6502 ASM sure is a great learning experience, and they'll not be wasting brainpower with anything useless for them.
<br />
<br />I do quite a lot of web programming as my job, but I still like very much the idea of an editor that runs on the same platform as the game itself. I just think that the usual 8KB of battery-backed RAM is a bit too little to work with, but I guess there are ways to use up to 32KB for that if you bankswitch that memory area...
<br />
<br />And I really liked the idea of using the light gun as a way to use the mouse for editing in emulators. I really would like to see that.
<br />
<br />I haven't decided how to go about the level editor in my game yet. My level format is pretty complex, and I doubt any existing editors will help me much. I'd hate to code some half-assed windows program just to get the job done, but I also don't want to spend months on coding an editor.

<br />That or just wire an NES controller port onto a Super NES mouse. Both systems use same underlying clocked-serial protocol.

<br />
<br />Also, I'd only use my level editor with an emulator, because you already have the mouse to use as the light gun, and the cursor is on screen, and if you can pull it off, it can work a lot more similar to a PC program. I don't know why you'd want to use it on the real NES. To be sitting in a chair, shooting at the screen, telling people that you're making a level, I think you'd feel pretty rediculous. But it wouldn't look/feel/be as strange on an emulator.

Since it is wasteful to store them like this (because of a bunch of blank "tiles" with nothing), you'd have to convert from this grid format into coordinates, to make a more compact list of objects. That's what I understood from their demo. Yeah, they have this nice demo that shows what the program can do.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">tepples wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">That or just wire an NES controller port onto a Super NES mouse.

How many NES emulators emulate the SNES mouse? If there are any, then a real mouse would be great.<br /><br />The light gun way does not seem to bad. If using the binary search way to look for a hit, some 12 frames should be enough to tell which exact tile (out of the 960 possibilities) was shot. That should be enough for a level-editing interface.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">bunnyboy wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">just use a paint program then write a bitmap -&gt; level format converter.</div>
<br />Yeah, I've seen people doing that before. There are a couple of problems with this though, as it's visually impossible to distinguish colors that differ by one unit, and I might just want to place metatile 25 right beside metatile 26. That won't be asy to see.
<br />
<br />Also, I don't think that would work well with my level format, that is not made of metatiles that are made of tiles. My levels are made of screens, that are made of structures, that are made of blocks, that are made of metatiles, that are made of tiles. This is so that I can have huge Sonic-like levels, without using much memory. There is no way to edit that in a simple bitmap.

<br />i don't care much for it as a general purpose language, but i find that visual basic 6 (never tried .NET) was perfect for these types of things. i spat out an editor for my level format in a few hours.

<br />though, at heart it's still a BASIC derivative...

But fortunately, you wouldn't have to check all 960 tiles.

<br />Nestopia claims to emulate a mouse, but I don't know whether it's the same mouse as the Super NES mouse that was bundled with each copy of Mario Paint.
