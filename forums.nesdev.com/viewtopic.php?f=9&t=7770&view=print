<br />i know it is possible to convert a TKROM to TKSROM, so thought this could be done.  thanks!

<br />
<br />Apparent mirroring for some reason....I dunno. Of course it's possible some way, and possibly easy since it's just the mirroring, but I am not sure about it.

<br />
<br />Anyway, I'm fairly sure it's possible. You'd just have to reroute a couple of traces (plus the ones you have to rewire because of the FlashROM/EPROM you're gonna use, which don't have the same pinout as Nintendo's ROMs). Just connect CHR A17 from the MMC3 to the CHR chip and the mirroring control (which is apparently unused) to CIRAM A10.

<br />i have an excess of them and want to use them as TLROM's.  just didn't want them to go to waste

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Like tokumaru said it should be possible.  Double check but the only thing that would really keep it from working is if you cart/NES edge connectiong that you needed and happened to be missing on the TLSROM that you actually need. 
<br />
<br />That's really the only possible deal breaker.  Everything beyond that is just connections you'll either have to make or break.  I'm working on drawing up the circuits for most common boards right now for another project and have plans to submit them to bootgod when I'm done to share with all.  
<br />
<br />You just need to reverse engineer the circuit.  The best way I've found is to start at the NES connector edge and follow everypath the trace takes.  It's probably easier to make a table of chip pin numbers vice actually drawing all the runs on a single paper.  
<br />
<br />After you do that for one board you can do the same for the other but just make note of any differences.  If you're doing it already I recommend removing the rom chips atleast to make sure you find all forks in the circuit path, but it's not necessary if you're careful about it.  
<br />
<br />Then just make the necessary changes if needed.  You could of course just try it first.  Just directly swap roms between games or put your own rom in there with the necessary pin changes.   It may very well just work.
<br />
<br />If the difference is mirroring it should be an easy fix because they use the same mapper that's controlling the mirroring.   I don't have a TLSROM on hand otherwise I'd look into it more closely for ya.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />For those of you not familiar with TLSROM:
<br />
<br />The CHR bankswitching logic of the MMC3 is still functional when PPU addresses outside of the $0000-$1FFF range (the pattern tables) are accessed. This means that the MMC3 can't tell the difference between pattern table accesses and name table accesses, so it will still control the CHR address lines according to the CHR banks that are switched even when name tables are accessed.
<br />
<br />The TLSROM takes advantage of this behavior to allow better mirroring control than the MMC3 ordinarily offers. Instead of connecting the highest CHR address line to the CHR chip, this line is routed to the NES, where it will select which name table it should read from. The actual mirroring line that comes out of the MMC3 isn't used at all.
<br />
<br />So, if the first pattern table ($0000-$0FFF) is divided into 4 1KB chunks, so will the name tables ($2000-$2FFF), because the MMC3 can't tell the difference. Conveniently enough, name tables (plus their respective attribute tables) are 1KB large, so by using the highest CHR bit of each of the 4 CHR chunks you can select which of the 2 name tables will be used for each of the 4 name table slots. This allows you to arrange the 2 existing name tables any way you want. you can have vertical mirroring, horizontal mirroring, single screen mirroring and even diagonal mirroring.
<br />
<br />The disadvantage is that since you lose one address line, the largest CHR chip you can use is 128KB instead of the usual 256KB. Actually, you can still use all 256KB, but the half of the chip the tiles come from will be "tied" to the name table they're used in, which is not convenient at all in most cases.
<br />
<br />As you can see, the difference between TLSROM and TLROM is very small. Like I said before, you just have to connect the CHR A17 to the CHR chip and cut the current connection, and also connect the unused mirroring pin to where CHR A17 was previously connected. After that, the usual modifications apply.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I think it's easier to modify the board than hack the games... but yeah, hacking them is an option. Games that divide $0000-$0FFF in 2KB chunks (as opposed to 1KB chunks) might never work properly through hacking though, since some mirroring configurations are impossible in that mode.

<br />The wiki suggests that if you're doing single-screen mirroring, you can in theory reserve half the tiles for your playfield and the other half for your status bar, menu, cut scenes, etc. Then put your playfield tiles on nametable 0 and everything else on nametable 1. Sprites can go on either as space is available. But I doubt that the TLSROM board itself supports a 256 KiB CHR ROM.
<br />
<br />In non-swapped CHR bank mode ($0000-$0FFF in 2 KiB chunks), single-screen mirroring and horizontal mirroring (vertical arrangement) are possible, just not vertical mirroring (horizontal arrangement) or L-shaped or diagonal mirroring.
