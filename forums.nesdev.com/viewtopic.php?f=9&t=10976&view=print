Thanks for all the help.</div><br /><br />I don't know much about the hardware side; what I can say is that if you emulate &quot;whenever PPU A10 is 1, CHR A17 is forced to 1&quot;, you get the emulator screenshot I posted, which looks EXACTLY the same as the screen you posted.<br /><br />Whatever the source of this defect, it would not cause a problem with Klax or Shinobi because the incorrect data is in the CHR A17 line, which they ignore.

The rambo pinouts as detailed on the wiki for mapper 64 is wrong, or more likely swapped with the mapper 158 variant (I do not have alien syndrome handy to verify). chr A17 is actually pin 22 on the rambo chip, and pin 29 is apparently CIRAM A10. I moved my jumper wire for A17 and everything is a-ok now. For anyone who stumbles across this looking for instructions for this or general tengen repro help, my wiring is:<br /><br />klax board, no 7432 chip<br />prg pin 2 (a16) -&gt; rambo pin 2<br />prg pin 24 (/OE) -&gt; GND<br />chr pin 30 (a17) -&gt; rambo pin 22<br /><br />as a side note, could someone tell me what the two pieces on the board in the green rectangles are? I think the one is a 0-ohm resistor, but I'm not familiar with the other. Assuming that is a 0-ohm resistor, is that the same thing as running a wire between those two points?<br /><br />Thank you everyone for your help and input. This was driving me nuts.
