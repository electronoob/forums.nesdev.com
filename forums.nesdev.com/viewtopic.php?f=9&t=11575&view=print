		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I could use some new controllers for my NES, and was wondering what the best option is these days.<br /><br />Currently I've got an AV Famicom controller, which I'm pretty happy with except for the A/B button placement (the buttons are placed at an angle, instead of being vertically aligned like on the original NES/Famicom controllers). I've also got a couple of original NES controllers that have seen their best days (flimsy D-pad, worn out B-button).<br /><br />Are those fix-a-pad kits a good option? Any particular &quot;brand&quot; that is better than others?<br /><br />I've seen newly produced NES controllers from SJ, TTX, Tomee and Innovation(?). There are also ones named &quot;Turbo Card&quot; or something like that. Has anyone here used any of these and can tell if they're any good? I'm looking for something with an accurate D-pad, and A/B buttons that have the same placement and similar feel as the ones on an original NES controller. Obviously it shouldn't break after a few months of use, and it's a plus if it has roughly the same weight as an original controller (I've got some 3rd party SNES controllers that weigh almost nothing, which just feels wrong).<br /><br />The reason I'm considering 3rd party controllers is that original NES controllers in good condition can be pretty expensive these days (I've seen people trying to sell them for nearly $30 a piece).

It just comes down to someone taking the time to do it.<br /><br />With that said, I'm also interested in the same thing as the OP.

Not sure if such adapters are sold anywhere, however.

But I wouldn't consider it a good controller for games where you often want to hold down the B button and be able to tap/press the A-button at the same time (without holding either your arm or the controller at a weird angle), like the SMB games.<br />Also, it's currently the only NES controller I've got that's in good working order. I'd like to have at least one more.<br /><br />I've ordered a couple of different controllers, so I guess I'll post here at some later date to say what I think about them.

Blew my mind.<br /><br />Using your fingers instead gives you a lot more precision, especially in games where fast button presses are essential. Just look at any arcade machine.
