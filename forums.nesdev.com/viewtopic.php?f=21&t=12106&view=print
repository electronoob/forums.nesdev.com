I figured the least best we could do is try to get feedback on the artwork and sprites we have made;<br /><br /><img src="http://i.imgur.com/oHPQKYo.png" alt="Image" /><img src="http://i.imgur.com/rSX8uh7.png" alt="Image" /><img src="http://i.imgur.com/2GSf4QJ.png" alt="Image" /><img src="http://i.imgur.com/kiZdOFG.png" alt="Image" /><br /><img src="http://i.imgur.com/JTzD2Tu.png" alt="Image" /><img src="http://i.imgur.com/BXlXkqw.png" alt="Image" /><img src="http://i.imgur.com/qhOcAKL.png" alt="Image" /><img src="http://i.imgur.com/gUK2ilC.png" alt="Image" /><br /><br />These are some of the level tiles we have been working on so far. I figured NESdev would be the best place to go for critique to NES accuracy. Using a good looking color palette has also been an issue, but currently we use a palette someone posted here:<br /><img src="http://i49.tinypic.com/spye1c.png" alt="Image" /><br /><br /><img src="http://i.imgur.com/YSwYRep.png" alt="Image" /><br />This was a quick comparison I did of the palette my friend was using:<br /><img src="http://bobrost.com/nes/files/NES_Palette.png" alt="Image" /><br /><br />We're both still reading and trying to understand how NES hardware works, so any tips and suggestions would be useful.

The Player character is also 16 pixels wide.  The NES can display up to 8 sprites in a row without flicker, and sprite in this case means a graphical object that's either 8*8 or 8*16 in size.  What you might think of as a sprite, in this case the entire character, is referred to as a meta sprite, which is a group of sprites.  If the player and the caterpillar were on the same level, there would be flicker, but seeing that they're on different levels, there's little chance for flicker to be truly noticeable.<br /><br />Also, it's been widely regarded as a good idea to design and flesh out your game in a higher level language while adhering to the NES limitations, and then converting your completed game for use on the NES.  Whether you will port it or someone else is entirely on the wall.

Using column D colours requires special treatment during fadeout to avoid 0D. On some emulators 3D/2D might have the same colour as 10/00, and 1D might be black, so you may want to avoid using column 0 and column D colours side by side, if you're not avoiding them altogether.

I agree that repeating 3/4 of a palette is a huge waste of colors, but the solution you propose would make the game look flatter, and not as great as originally drawn. I propose the exact opposite: keep using separate palettes for the different objects, but have them differ by more than 1 color (even if they're just slightly different and not completely different hues), so that you have MORE colors on screen. If both palettes can be reused for other objects, even better!

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Regarding 8*8 or 8*16 sprites, it's only one or the other.  Whether this is global or can change per screen is something I don't know yet.  I do know that there's advantages and disadvantages to each method, but seeing how your graphics look, I'd say that 8*16 would work better.  In short, the advantage of 8*16 is that you can display more with the same limitations, the disadvantage is that it's rather clumsy, especially if you wish to have Megaman/Mr. Gimmick like sprite overlaying for more colors.  With 8*8, a single tile over Megaman's face would have a smaller chance of causing flicker than if it was 8*16, since the sprite is now taller, and the sprites can overlap.<br /><br />Think of it this way.  If you had 9 8*16 sprites lined up so that they rose one pixel each but they have one line in common, they would all flicker.  Think of how Hogan's Alley or Challenger writes Congratulations on screen.<br /><br /><img src="http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/b/8/e/gfs_18565_3_1.jpg" alt="Image" /><br /><br />The letters don't flicker because they're 8*8, and each letter is moved up one pixel each.  You can have eight letters in a row without flicker, and the next letters would be unaffected by this.  But if those were 8*16 sprites, you couldn't do it this way, the sprites would have to be spaced two pixels taller.

If you could post all the letter and number tiles as an attached image, I'm willing to suggest some fixes.<br /><br />Different TVs at different settings (and with different proprietary skin tone enhancement algorithms) will produce different palettes, so don't worry about that. If you have a PowerPak, I have a tool to let you view your backgrounds on your NES and TV. <br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">rainwarrior wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">it may be a good idea to avoid the D column greys</div><br />In addition, on an NES-compatible system with an RGB PPU (PlayChoice, Famicom Titler, Sharp C1, 2C03/2C05-modded NES), all D column colors are exactly black. The safest grays are these:<br /><ul><li>0F: black </li><li>00: lightness close to 11-1C </li><li>10: lightness close to 20-2C </li><li>20: white </li></ul><br /><div class="quotetitle">ShaneLite wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">Good to know about the way sprites work; do NES games use one or both? The caterpillar was meant to walk in segments, but that could be too complex. </div><br />A scene can contain 8x8 or 8x16 sprites. A larger sprite is made out of multiple sprites: Super Mario is eight 8x8s in <em>Super Mario Bros.</em> or four 8x16s in <em>Super Mario Bros. 3</em>. Most of the time, an entire picture uses one size of sprite, but you should be able to use 8x8 for the status bar and 8x16 for the playfield without problems, as the write to $2000 to set the high bit of the X scroll position also changes the sprite size. Use 8x8 rules above the split and 8x16 rules below and there shouldn't be problems.<br /><br />In any case, your Wiggler expies can probably get away with a 16x16 head and four 8x16 segments, for a total of 6 out of 8 sprite slivers (a sliver is 8x1 pixels), leaving 2 for the player character. Flicker when using your weapon can be expected.

The catterpillar in that mock-up already has lots of overlap between its pieces, so it's not like it's gonna leave some important gaps.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />It's commendable that you're going after NES restrictions, but since this isn't intended to run on NES hardware I think all of this streamlining is pointless. Most people don't like the sprite flickering and if you're going to be designing your characters around sprite flickering, you'll be watering them down. If I were playing this game and knew nothing about NES restrictions (about 90% of the people who play these games) I really could care less. As long as the game is fun and the atmosphere is nice, that's all that matters.<br /><br />And since you're going to be modelling your game after Shovel Knight, <a href="http://www.gamasutra.com/blogs/DavidDAngelo/20140625/219383/Breaking_the_NES_for_Shovel_Knight.php" class="postlink">this</a> might be worth a read.<br /><br />But regardless, I think these are some great mockups. Your foreground and background have great contrast and it's really cool how you separated your foreground/background using warm/cool colors. Your character designs are pretty crisp and I'm a big fan of how you dithered your waterfalls to lower their contrast. I'll have to give that a shot later...
