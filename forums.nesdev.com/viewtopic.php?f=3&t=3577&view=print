		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Hi.
<br />
<br />In about three weeks, I need to start my third year dissertation at Uni, and was considering writing a NES emulator.
<br />
<br />I use Java for all programming and have little experience in any other language.
<br />
<br />I know about hardware in a high level way (i.e. processors, RAM, Virtual Memory, page files) and have done a little assembly programming using the MIPS 2000 architecture.
<br />
<br />I know very little about how the hardware works on a low level and think this may be a problem.
<br />
<br />What I was wondering is whether it seems like a viable option for me to attempt this?
<br />
<br />I would have until late April 2008 to complete the report and hand it in.
<br />
<br />Thanks for any insights you can give me.
<br />

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Welcome Vegenad. Programming a NES emulator in Java can be done, your deadline is fine, and your general knowledge (even if it's not much) of hardware is a plus. Not knowing how the NES works on a low level doesn't matter, that's where you'll start: researching and lots of reading.
<br />
<br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">What I was wondering is whether it seems like a viable option for me to attempt this?</div>Only you can answer that one. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" /> Since this is a school project, you'll probably need to focus on documentation. The NES has been documented thoroughly already, including emulation aspects, so your report might look like a mixed bag of known information and your own experience. I'm not sure if your teacher(s) would be ok with that. You could instead try a different (not done before) approach at NES emulation.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />i think your project is doable.  i would suggest using C or C++ (i prefer C) and sdl.  the mips background will help with the cpu core emulation.
<br />
<br />you say you know very little about the hardware, that might give you some work with the ppu (graphics).
<br />
<br />there is plenty of info and help here.  and if its open source some of us (me) could try it on our own, provided a makefile... :-D
<br />
<br />i say go for it

<br />If the goal is something that runs as a stand-alone application, C or C++ and SDL are just fine. But deployment with zero end-user effort is one of the big pluses of the Java platform, as a Java applet can run as a control on a web page. A program written in C++ can't do this unless you use the pricey ActiveX platform.

<br />
<br />Thanks for the advice everyone.
<br />
<br />I think there's a very good chance that i'm going to be going with this so expect many stupid questions to pop up on the boards in the near future <img src="./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" />.
<br />
<br />Again, cheers for the help.

<br />
<br />uhh no.  java is a PITA.  infact i dont think i have it here.  any app wirtten in java is java dependent.  i think i tried one of the tile apps on nesdev main page several times on 2 different platforms, always gave me an error.

<br />
<br />its not so bad. i tried this awhile back and had a Cartridge class that held the rom image in arrays. it had accessor methods that returned references to the needed arrays. this reference was then assigned to a variable in the CPU core (same for chr and the PPU core). its been awhile so im kinda grey on exactly how i had it setup. the emu never progressed very far past NROM and the discrete logic mappers, so i don't know what kinda performance hit you'll take when you toss more complex mappers and sound into the mix. i favored clean, organized code over speed when i started writing it.

<br />Yes, having gotten my feet wet in Java recently by writing some CPU and sound emulators, I can say that the lack of iterators (pointers) means a lot of useful techniques are unavailable. It's like being forced to keep the training wheels on your bike for all your life.
