		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Short story long: I bought Dorke and Ymp from Piko Interactive, enthusiastic to see that this &quot;New SWEDISH SNES game!&quot; I saw in a Swedish gaming mag in the 1990s that never appeared would finally be available after a 20 year delay.<br /><br />The game is notoriously difficult to play though, mostly due to the very limited attack and enemies that are hard to hit, making it quite a frustrating experience at times. Still, as a oldskool gamer I do enjoy a good challenge from time to time... up to a point. And that point was reached when the game unexpectedly crashed just as I was completing the second world after many hours of countless deaths:<br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/i89rfnute90fstu/DorkeAndYmpCrash.mp4?dl=0">https://www.dropbox.com/s/i89rfnute90fs ... h.mp4?dl=0</a><!-- m --><br /><br />So while I still want to complete the game, I'm not too keen on having to replay all of those frustrating levels due to this software glitch. So as we are in the 2016 with emulators with savestates and SNES powerpaks, I figured it should be easy enough to warp myself to the next place... if a file I could load in an emulator or my SNES powerpak would be included with my purchase. <br /><br />Piko Interactive turned out to be like any big bad company's customer support filter though: Saying the game is fine because people have evidently been able to play it to the end, and refusing to give me a file due to &quot;company policy&quot;. Bit of a shame that they can't show more goodwill towards their paying customers, but guess game publishers are just made of the same stuff no matter the company size and target audience.<br /><br />So long story short: I have no current easy means to dump SNES cartridges as I've never needed to until now, and was wondering what the cheapest/easiest option is? I know the &quot;Retrode&quot; exists and looks pretty cool for what it is, but has more functionality than I need and seems like a slightly expensive option to get just a single cartridge dumped. A SNES version of something like Chris Covell's <a href="http://www.chrismcovell.com/TapeDump_Controls.html" class="postlink">TapeDump</a> that I could run on my SNES powerpak would be ideal for this situation, but I don't think something like that exists yet?

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />The Retrode is probably still the easiest way to dump stuff, aside from tracking down an old 90s backup unit and hoping it still works. There are some other, newer solutions, like the <a href="https://github.com/defparam/21FX" class="postlink">21fx</a> and <a href="https://github.com/sanni/cartreader" class="postlink">this Arduino cart reader</a> but they involve a bit of DIY hardware stuff that may not be worth it just to dump this one game.<br /><br />However, Dorke &amp; Ymp also has <a href="http://store.steampowered.com/app/474810" class="postlink">a Steam release</a> for just $5 which is just a SNES ROM plus a customized build of Mednafen. I'm willing to bet that the ROM included with this version is identical to the one on the cartridge release.

Given how paranoid Piko Interactive seem to be, I could easily imagine some encryption or other scheme being used for the Steam release, and spending time on trying to crack copy protection has never been my cup of tea...

I even tested the tracks I could.<br />I think that if I dump them, I could have an idea of what's going on.<br /><br />Long time ago, I've seem a guy nicknamed DiskDude who had build an SNES cartridge reader with only discrete parts. This dumper was named CartDisk.<br />The last version I could find to download is the one that is built with 2 microcontrolers, wich I just can't afford.  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_cry.gif" alt=":cry:" title="Crying or Very sad" /><br />The e-mail in the page's contact info doesn't exists anymore, all the links I've found on the wayback machine are broken too.<br />Does someone have the schematics and software for the discrete logic version and are willing to share?<br />Thanks in advance!

What kind of hardware do you have access to?<br /><br />If you're ok with doing some manual &quot;uncooking&quot; of the memory map, you could just use an array of digital counters (74'161 / 74'590 / 4040) and a computer with a parallel port. Some software on the computer would have to set up the parallel port in ECP mode to support reading things a byte at a time.<br /><br />... and honestly, I don't know how you're supposed to do that under Windows's modern I/O permissions. The last time I checked was when GiveIO was the answer.
