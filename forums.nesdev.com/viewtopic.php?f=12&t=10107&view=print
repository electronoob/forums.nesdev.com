		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I'm currently picking away at a hack for Final Fight Guy (J) and am making really good progress but I find myself horribly constrained by the limitations of Geiger's SNES9X debugger, mainly the fact that the RAM window updates at such a painfully slow pace and that it seems to want to crash every three to five minutes. I guess I'm a bit spoiled by FCEUXD SP. <br /><br />Is there some kind of acceptable alternative debug emulator that might be flying under my radar? I find it hard to believe that this is the only SNES emulator out there with these kinds of utilities. Thanks, guys.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />BSNES as some point featured a debugger but it didn't seem as handy as the one SNES9X one that is out there. I agree that a SNES emulator with a debugegr like FCEUX would be amazing. I wish every system had such a nice debugger. I think BGB is such an emulator for Gameboy/Color. But other than those 2 systems I don't think anything else has something so useful.

I'm not holding my breath for another version of Geiger's to be released, but even if there was some kind of RAM viewer out there that updated more than twice per second I'd be happy enough.

But I'm not [yet] up to the task of writing a SNES emulator with the required access points.  My debugger memory and register viewers are all data-driven based on models of the underlying HW.  It'd likely take not that much time to create models of the SNES memory/registers.
