		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I've been playing with reverse-engineering FF7 NES. It currently uses mapper 163, which is a pirate mapper allowing a mind-blowing 2MB of PRG data. When looking at ROM, it's a complete mess. Almost 512K is left unused. The code looks gigantic and massively inefficient, and the Chinese character text engine eats massive amounts of PPU memory. 
<br />
<br />It has gotten to the point that a rewrite might do the game better. Sadly, mapper 163 isn't very well documented. It appears to bank 32K at a time from $8000-$FFFF, which results in a lot of duplicated code throughout the ROM. (the vectors and reset routine for example) The bank switch registers appear to be $5000-$5004 (??? - I don't have my notes in front of me), but their function is elusive to me.
<br />
<br />I may just switch to MMC5, as that seems to allow 1MB PRG and 1MB CHR, but that looks really complicated and there isn't much I can find on programming examples. (I'll be using the assembler and linker from the CC65 package)
<br />
<br />And yes, I'm writing this for an emulator, the size makes it impractical to think about a hardware solution.
<br />
<br />Any ideas on how to go about this?

For example UxROM can be modified to allow 4MB of PRG by replacing the 4-bit register with an 8-bit one. Many emulators already support this (they use all 8-bits of the bank write). However iNES format restricts the PRG ROM size to 2MB.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Bigger is cheaper for a cart really. 128KB ROMs are legacy hardware now. Often it is much cheaper to get an SMT part in 1MB to 4MB. And the UxROM variant that TheFox suggested is dead-simple, but uses CHR-RAM.
<br />
<br />I would caution you to think about how much room you actually need. I spent a month agonizing over which mapper to use before I wrote my first attempt at a Zeldroidvania game. Once I finally gave in and started writting it for MMC1, I found I could make a game the size of Super Metroid with a 256 KB PRG-ROM with CHR-RAM.
<br />
<br />Also remember that MMC1 can address up to 512 KB of PRG-ROM and 32 KB of PRG-RAM in the SXROM configuration, and is much better supported on emulators than MMC5. Better yet, if you're worried about a cartridge release, RetroZone has an <a href="http://www.retrousb.com/product_info.php?cPath=24&amp;products_id=43" class="postlink">SXROM-Compatible Repro Board</a> for only $9.

<br />Emulators might support WRAM being mapped. Adding it to a real cartridge wouldn't take alot either.
<br />
<br />You shouldn't be surprised if this FF7 is horribly inefficient and clunky. It's not like it was made by top notch programmers and designers. MMC1 can support alot more PRG-ROM than existing configurations support. Currently only one allows for 512K but you can easily bump that up to 2MB if needed. You can hijack more CHR register bits. The 512K steals 1, just steal 2 more and you have 2MB. Ofcourse if it has 1MB CHR this doesn't help. Do you have a document on this 163 mapper?

<br />The mapper is simple, 32k PRG bankswitching, with WRAM.
<br />There's also a register that makes it magically change the left pattern table to the right one after the scanline 128, for people to lazy to use a sprite 0 hit.  It's unknown how it works, so emulators just cheat to emulate this.

<br />Would you likewise call the developers of Punch-Out!!, Fire Emblem, and Famicom Wars lazy for adding CHR bankswitches that take effect on $0FD0-$0FEF reads?
