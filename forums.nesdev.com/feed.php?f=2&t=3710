Well, I guess we'll have to wait and see about your boss. I'm so mad about my game engine, I've scrapped it about 3 times before, due to bad programming. But I'm just about done with the scrolling engine, and everything is going SOOOO well. Before I wasn't really calculating anything as much as I was doing guess and check. But now, everything is done with math in my game, and I feel so good about it. But yeah, I'm not even close to the game part of it, I'll have to do music after I finish the scrolling engine, which should be today, hopefully.<br /><br />I'm making a game that's pretty much exactly like Castlevania SOTN, and I'm really wondering if I should make the main character out of more than one pallete. I'm thinking no, because he has yellowish hair, and he's wearing all black, pretty much. This would be really hard anyways, because you have to have all other enemies different with the aid of only two palletes. I suppose that's only for the enemies who are on screen. Once they're off screen, you can update the pallete. The enemies would have to be at the very least 256 pixels away from each other. Also, in a side scroller, I only have 64 sprites to work with, I can't just waste a ton of them on the main character...<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=138">Celius</a> — Mon Nov 19, 2007 11:10 am</p><hr />

Doing the sprite 0 hit wouldn't be hard if the upper part wasn't moving, and the lower part was. However, I don't really see why you'd want this. But, I do know a way you could do the sprite 0 hit and have a floor. I use a formula in my scrolling engine that takes pixel coordinates, and calculates the address of the BG tile at those coordinates. So if 8,8 goes through the routine, it comes out with $2021. Say our boss is just a big tall guy walking around, moving left and right. Keep track of the Y coordinate that would be right below his feet. Put that Y coordinate and the whatever the X scroll is set to through the routine, and it will calculate the PPU address for below his feet, but at the left side of the screen. Store a white tile at this location, and do your sprite 0 hit. After your hit, switch to a different name table that has the floor in it.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=138">Celius</a> — Sun Nov 18, 2007 4:32 pm</p><hr />

But there would still be a lot of limitations... The background (behind the big enemy) would still need to be just a solid color, and you'd need to define a "safe" ammount of scrolling in order to not end up showing te floor out of place (before the bottom of the screen), something that could happen because of mirroring. 1-screen mirroring would allow for much more movement though, as the floor would be in one name table and the enemy on another, so they'd never meet by accident.<br /><br />EDIT: I remember one of these huge enemies from Mega Man (don't remember which game, but I thing the enemy was a huge yellowish robot with large hands and a massive jaw) moved back and forth over a floor, but this floor was mainly composed of horizontal lines, and it was scrolled along with the enemy, but you dodn't really notice because there were no vertical detais.

It's hard with Sprite-0 hit because you need sprite 0 to hit something (ie:  it has to hit the background -- which is hard if the background is moving).  It is possible, though, if you plan it out well.<br /><br />You can also use mapper IRQs or another timing mecahnism.  And in fact, many games do this.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=33">Disch</a> — Sun Nov 18, 2007 3:00 pm</p><hr />

Heh, I saw that before, and I wondered if that was a homebrew thing or something from the Master System games!<br /><br />If this was something I actually planned on doing in a game, I'd definitely just do it for the main character only, and possibly for bosses.<br /><br />What about the other method, sprites on background?  I take it this would only really be useful for static background objects, unless there was nothing else in the background and you had the freedom to scroll the screen around (strikes me as good for shmup bosses).  Do you know of any games/demos where either of these techniques were used to great effect?<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3438">UncleSporky</a> — Sun Nov 18, 2007 8:48 am</p><hr />

Just get to a point in the game where you can see one of those sprites, using an emulator that will allow you to see the contents of the pattern tables, such as FCEUXD or Nintendulator. Try to locate the patterns and you'll see the small pieces that compose the sprite, and since each individual 8x8 sprite (or 8x16, another mode the NES has) can use a different palette, depending on the way they are arranged the character they represent will seem to have more colors.<br /><br />Take a look at the Sonic sprite in my avatar... it's for the NES, and has 6 colors, because I use 2 different palettes to make it up, overlapping the skin parts over the blue parts (one palette has 2 blues and white, and the other is a gradient of the skin tone, with the darkest one closer to red).<br /><br />This trick must be used carefully though, because of the limit of 8 sprites per scanline. With all the overlapping for just one character, there might not be much left for the other sprites on screen.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=95">tokumaru</a> — Sat Nov 17, 2007 9:40 pm</p><hr />
