<div class="quotetitle">tepples wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"><br />But it's not as necessary now that the DPCM Split technique is known.<br /></div><br />The DPCM split is far from ideal. As far as I can tell your method is not scanline-oriented, which means that the split can't be dynamically moved up and down at runtime (meaning it can't be used for skipping the status bar à la Crystalis, for example). And my method, which is scanline-oriented, uses too much CPU time (up to 20% of the 240 visible scanlines for <strong>each</strong> split). I'm trying to cut that time down, but have failed so far.<br /><br />Also, I have nothing against giving up the DPCM channel, but I'm sure a lot of people plan to keep using it.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=95">tokumaru</a> — Tue Sep 21, 2010 4:17 pm</p><hr />

I like CopyNES, but frankly the software sucks if you use it exclusively for quick tests for development (while being great for dumping carts, mapper testing, even emulating and single-stepping through the code, on the NES CPU itself).  What I've hoped to see is a command-line app that will upload (user specifies the plugin and ROM file), then enter play mode.  I noticed people were supporting CopyNES in linux, it would be nice if that sort of functionality ever showed up in an app such as ucon64.  I haven't been following it much though.<br /><br />The 2nd thread tepples linked to is my idea for a flash cart, I think it's better than MMC1.  There is no IRQ, 2 16kB PRG pages, 2 2kB CHR pages (other 2kB halves are fixed), h/v/1 mirroring select register, optional 32kB WRAM.  Logic fits in a 36-macrocell CPLD.  The hope is to make it cheap enough to use it for releasing games.  And as a cheap flashcart, why not buy several, and share your games/demos/music with friends, heheh.   CopyNES could program it even if it was 100% erased.   The expansion port adapter I'm working on (with some great help from Xious) and virtually any adapter, could program it using the bootloader discussed in this thread.  The Verilog is ready, I need to do a good board layout for it, but I've sorta jumped onto getting this expansion device working because it'll make it a lot more interesting.<br /><br />The expansion port adapter could support IRQ (and I believe NMI, as well!).  Obviously that's only any use if you have the expansion hardware though.  But I'm hoping the sound capabilities, file saving/loading, and other features will make it pretty interesting.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=10">Memblers</a> — Tue Sep 21, 2010 3:41 pm</p><hr />

<title type="html"><![CDATA[Looking for swapless MMC1 devcart]]></title>

<em>[Soon to be split from <a href="http://nesdev.com/bbs/viewtopic.php?p=67716#67716" class="postlink">this post</a>]</em><br /><br />I am after a devcart that doesn't need chip swapping for each build, but for MMC1.  Well, I would love to switch to MMC3, but retrousb doesn't sell MMC3 carts for fabrication.  (Someone once mentioned that the required number of gates in a PLC for MMC3 exceeded what was cost-effective or something).<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3664">clueless</a> — Tue Sep 21, 2010 12:58 pm</p><hr />
