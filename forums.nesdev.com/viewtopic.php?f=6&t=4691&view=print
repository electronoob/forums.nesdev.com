<br />
<br />I found a demo ROM at zophar.net displaying the TMNT logo while playing a high quality sample file (probably OGG Vorbis) also known as the show's music theme. They described that it uses an "obscure mapper", probably made from scratch.
<br />
<br />I'm very interested into this topic so I might ask you: Is it possible to create a non-physical mapper (for the beginning) that can play OGG Vorbis or WAVE files, during the executing program, without slowdowns?

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I know how "play this MP3 file" could be made into a physical mapper: have the cart control a CD player. A CD player's remote control uses a serial protocol over a wired or infrared physical layer. So we just have to emulate a serial port, and the mapper turns this into commands to a (real or emulated) CD player.
<br />
<br />Or if you're willing to accept a 7 percent slowdown, you can use DPCM to play back a long sample within the ROM file. A long time ago, I made a <a href="http://pics.pineight.com/max-300.zip" class="postlink">demo</a> that plays "Max 300", a song from DDR, through a common mapper.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />The short answer is yes.
<br />
<br />The FC runs audio through the cartridge (and the NES runs it through the expansion port iirc), so any external device can output any sound through the NES (this is how VRC6, N106, etc expansion sound works -- the hardware for that existed on the cartridge, not on the NES).  It's possible to have any amount of external hardware which runs outside of the NES that sort of "adds on" to the capabilities of the NES.
<br />
<br />Probably the best way to visualize this concept is like the Sega CD and Sega 32X addons to Sega Genesis.  The idea is the same, only instead of having a seperate addon unit, all the parts would be included in every single cartridge.
<br />
<br />This, of course, is totally impractical.  And if you're going to go this far with NES addons you might as well not even bother with the NES part.
<br />
<br />Plus fabricating imaginary mappers (which that TMNT demo didn't do) is a big no-no.  It's hard enough to stay on top of mappers that actually exist.  Adding phoney ones to the mix doesn't do anyone any good.
<br />
<br />So the realistic answer is no.

<br />If source codes were given by the developer(s), why not? <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />

<br />Btw. You're right. If this demo used a homebrew mapper, it wouldn't be functional on a emulator.

<br />I imagine it couldn't be too hard to interface the track changing buttons to a mapper also.

<br />Because not all emulators have a compatible software license. More importantly, not all emulators run on sufficiently beefy hardware. For example, I could build a mapper for the NES containing an entire Game Boy chipset. It would run the ROM as a Game Boy ROM and forwards the video to the NES PPU. (In fact, Nintendo released a developer product called Wide Boy that did just that, and then turned it into a consumer product for Super NES called Super Game Boy.) Emulators that have trouble keeping up with the base system alone, such as PocketNES on GBA or SNEmulDS on Nintendo DS, would have a female dog of a time adding an 8080-family CPU and a Game Boy PPU to the mix.

<br />Hm... you got a point there. Maybe it would be better focusing on the actual hardware...

<br />
<br />Altough there should be a way to write a normal programm in a maneer so that it can interupt each constant amount of cycles to play the next WAV sample, this sounds extremely tedious to do.
