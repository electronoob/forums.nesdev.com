<br />
<br />But now that you clarified that you are black-box cloning and not white-box porting, what you say sounds more reasonable. For instance, the guy with the Sonic avatar (tokumaru?) is cloning Sonic for NES, trying to make a significant improvement over Somari.

<br />I realized I can simply use preview to ensure i didn't miss anything, as i have been repeatedly editing every post atleast 35+ times.
<br />
<br />plus my firefox has spell check in editable text boxes anyways, plus undo/redo text edit.
<br />
<br />BTW, Dilbert's boss was correct. Using smaller fonts actually uses less RAM in firefox!

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Realm of Existence is a series i have been working on since 1989.
<br />
<br />Puzzlum : Realm of Existence I killed itself SMITH style, taking out the entire dev system after 2 weeks (1996) unreleased
<br />
<br />Realm of Existence II was near complete for a single level when it ran out of string space. (released only to Lord Nightmare)
<br />
<br />Realm of Existence III QBX the source got corrupted. (1999) limited alpha release
<br />
<br />Realm of Existence III DBA was going nowhere fast due to lack of development of the SDK i was using. limited private alpha release. project  code lost due to burglary. (2002/2003)
<br />
<br />Realm of Existence IV QBX i simply lost interest in due to lack of time. released 2002,2003,2004,2007. known glitch: required item 'grapple' to solve puzzle acccidently compiled to be marked as rare item. 'cactus seeds' randomly missing from level.
<br />
<br />Realm of Existence V VB6 was screwed up due to winsock trouble.
<br />
<br />going back now.
<br />
<br />Puzzlum's Palace was a first person cinamatics ascii art game using two or three word ADVENT style commands. (never completed, 1989-1992)  floppy disk, never released except for a single copy for $2.
<br />
<br />Puzzlum : The Peninsula Fortress 1993. Remaked of Palace, nearly completed until computer hdd was stolen during hardware upgrade, never released
<br />
<br />Puzzlum : Story was a completed Engine i later compiled using QBX, that used asyncronous code, and was simply a choose your own adventure state based system. engine complete prototype, game code never completed, (1994) was first released in 1997.
<br />
<br />Puzzlum : Chat was lame and I abandoned the project early on. (1995, limited alpha post release 1999)
<br />
<br />Puzzlum : GigaDeva was Batch based and simply got misplaced. (1992, never released)
<br />
<br />Puzzlum : Dungeon used same style maps and overworld as MQ, but the battles were MQ map item based, (1994) 3 copies in limited release in 1994, source dev released on net 1997, 1999, 2003, 2007.
<br />
<br />Puzzlum : World II used an actual battle screen in a large overworld, and towns with autowalk on roads for your own player and npcs, basically a redraft of Dungeon, public appearance at middle school tech show spring 1996.
<br />
<br />Puzzlum : World III was simply a game of exploration in a massive world. With a god mode code to build towns and stuff Actraiser I style. The world was initially created using a top down land form generator and had persistant world, tho god mode was forced to be used to respawn during crash due to pov coord being saved separate from entity layers, and then hunt down the other copy of your self and kill it, often having to wander for hundreds of miles in the wilderness before finding him again.
<br />
<br />Puzzlum : Mindrealm was bascially a textual rogue with multiple party members and simple battle and spells. had good random dungeon generator, tho occaisionally unbeatable level. (1995)
<br />
<br />Puzzlum : Mindrealm II was the glitchy graphical remake, most levels unbeatable. (1997) released on net 1998, 1999
<br />
<br />Puzzlum : Mindrealm II-b extremely glitchy dat recov version with redone sprites and random number generation. released 2004, 2007
<br />
<br />Puzzlum : Mindrealm III was simply a labyrinth mega failure from scratch. (1998) unreleased
<br />
<br />Realm of Existence : Broodraven was too complicated but was an irc bot, i also remade the original Puzzlum game without graphics for irc with zork commands. on irc.intialized.org in circa 2002/2003.
<br />
<br />Puzzlum : IRC, crappy remake of puzzlum story as an irc bot, circa 2002/2003 irc.initialized.org
<br />
<br />Puzzlum : Shroud of Existence card game. 2002/2003 (alternate rule book 2004, 2005, 2006: Merovingian's Chateau de Necrovania, Necrovania) second rule book partially published on jargonxen.tripod.com, alternate rule book second draft net location forgotten. original rulebook destroyed by stray feline blood spill from car collision on road.
<br />
<br />RoE IV QBX 2007, incomplete 12 days of work, non-compilable.
<br />
<br />RoE IV Genesis, incomplete 5 weeks of work. not even alpha.
<br />
<br />NES RoE B3D sim, 2007 incomplete. 3 days work. may possibly have been   released fall 2007 if ever released
<br />
<br />RoE B3D Keal SDK , glitched windows update froze all possible future progress.
<br />
<br />RoE XBOX, total pipedream that died with RoE B3D Keal SDK
<br />
<br />RoE III NES, design stage. actual alpha development to begin jan to spring 2007.

<br />all i do i keep my source in raw form and upload archives in public locations on servers i have full control over, that i additionally burn to optical disc. BTW, the archive format i use is .LZMA.7z which seems to be the only existing compressive archive format that has no file system flaws.
<br />
<br />i do the same thing with mIRC logs, however i upload them to a secure location on the server and use my own parser to differentiate between private messages and public channels in order to list and display only publicly viewable data from within public channels for download.

<br />- What is "source in RAW form"? As far as I know, the "high-level" means a C/C++/C#/Java/VisualBasic/Whatever++ source files, never heard of a "RAW form" thing.
<br />
<br />- Unless someone corrects me, but what's the thing about "flaws" in a compression mode, as ZIP?

<br />
<br />Different file systems have different predefined attributes that can be assigned to a file:
<br /><ul><li>FAT: modification time; modified since last backup, !writable, hidden, system </li><li>Many UNIX file systems: modification time; last access time; user owning the file; "group" (ACL) responsible for file; readable, writable, executable/searchable for user, group, and world; execute setting user ID; execute setting group ID; "sticky" (on executable files, cache the binary after it terminates; on folders, forbid non-owners from renaming or deleting files) </li></ul>
<br />Every non-trivial archive format has a directory structure inside of it. A given archive format may or may not be able to represent everything that a machine's file system can represent. I understand jargon's "no file system flaws" statement to mean that the .7z format's directory can represent everything that the file system on his development machine can represent.
