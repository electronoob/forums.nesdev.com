So I wanted to know if the correct mapper is the only requirement, or is there anything else that such as the size of the game that is needed.<br /><br /><br />I'm sorry if this has already been answered somewhere else. But I couldn't find anything on google.<br /><br />I just want to be sure before I go out and buy a game that may not be able to be used as a donor.

I can't seem to find any threads about it now, but my google-foo sucks <img src="./images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" alt=":(" title="Sad" /> It all depends on weather or not the FFVII code uses the funky CHR-RAM banking in mapper 163. If not it could probably be ported to another mapper.<br /><br />To answer your question, without hacking the ROM, you'll need to find a board with the same mapper with enough PRG-ROM address lines to support a 2MByte (16MBit) ROM chip.

I have the Lei Día Huang Bi Ka Qiu Chuan Shuo (aka Pokémon Yellow)<br /><br />It has the ability to automatically switch CHRRAM pages on scanline 128, but I've found that in this game it is barely used, only on the title screen.

Please !<br /><br />As for your question this game uses a quite unique mapper (like many chineese pirates) and I don't even know what hardware this cart uses. If it has glob tops or any crap like that you could even be unable to replace the ROM sadly.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />It is essentially one giant BNROM cartridge, only with WRAM.  It just needs to be mapper-hacked.<br />But yeah, Nanjing can't code worth shit.  The code where they load font characters into VRAM looks fine and decently optimized, but their game algorithms are bad.  Using slow movement for walking around a map, then suddenly doubling the movement speed when you are scrolling the screen is inexcusable.

You can order some of those chips and what ever other hardware you may need (like a compatible socket adapter for flashing or for fixing to the board) and it should work just fine.<br /><br />If you have issues finding the part number just post a high-resolution image on this board.
