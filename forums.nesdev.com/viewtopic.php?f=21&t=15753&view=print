I think the key may be not overusing it. In the aloe vera picture, you see the grid at every border. Assume a coarser grid and then exploit it where you can for some nice details. <br /><br />Or if you want to convert a photo, you still may have some luck with either posterizing and retouching a grayscale, then apply attributes, or you can trace it in Illustrator and then convert the result back to a bitmap. A lot of time will be spent doing so, though, and autotrace never looks good, so maybe pixel painting directly over the picture will pay off better. And you'd probably still need to use sprites for finer differently coloured details to make the most of it.

For example we could imagine a title screen or a logo screen using such a technique - turning BG rendering off for most of the screen and use all (or a very large part) of the available nametable area to draw a small logo with better colours. You can get 15 tiles height (120 px) of 16x4 attributes, 7.5 tiles height (60 px) of 16x2 attributes or 3.75 tiles high (30 px) of 16x1 attributes in pure software - add RAM for 4-screen mirroring and you can get double of each.<br /><br />The OP mentionned 8x7 but I don't see how it would be any practical nor feasible to have a non-power-of-2 attribute granularity. Irregular granularity (such as 3-3-2 in each tile) would be feasible though.<br /><br />In practice this was almost never done because attribute table limitations are hardly the bottleneck of what can be done with NES graphics - i.e. you'll never be able to represent something with smaller colour granularity than you couldn't represent with less, it'll just look slightly better. On the other hand, more colours per tile done by overlapping sprites is a much more interesting option, so that's why NES games went that way to increase the graphics quality.

(There's nothing *stopping* you from doing 8x7 cartside, but it'd be a pain.)<br /><br />Some thought suggested that acting like it's 8x8 and then using the slivers to get some wiggle room on edges where you need a few more or fewer pixels of one color seems like the best use of a theoretical 8x1 (shallow slopes) rather than any picture actually needing to switch on a sliver and switch back the next down.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />That's right. A symmetrical ratio (16x16, 8x8) is easier to hide, so in the case of a 8x1 ratio or the like, moderate use of the fact will probably yield better looking results. Think of every change of attribute between one cell and the next as a potential grid shower. If just about every cell is different, you end up with what looks like paused tape noise, getting in the way of the picture. <br /><br />Just apply it here and there, where it looks the most convincing and/or to sometimes break the coarser x8 base act-as-grid. <br /><br />You could for example use three to five 8x1 slivers on top of each other to colour a tuft of grass hanging down in front of ground or rock, approximating next generation graphics.
