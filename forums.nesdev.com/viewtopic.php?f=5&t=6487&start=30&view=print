<br />
<br />The only thing that makes it difficult is having to press the A button at lightning speed.  If it autofired or just let you hold A it probably wouldn't be that hard.
<br />
<br />And the walls were no kind of obstacle at all.  At least not on the levels I played.
<br />
<br />EDIT:
<br />
<br />Just enabled Turbo-A and used it.
<br />
<br />Blew through Possessor's level like it was nothing.
<br />
<br />This game isn't that hard.
<br />
<br />EDIT AGAIN:
<br />
<br />Firelord and Metphiso (or whatever his name is) are definately the hardest of the 5.
<br />
<br />But yeah, the difficulty in this game comes from the stupid way you have to shoot.  If you play with Turbo it's just another vert/horz shooter like Gradius/Lifeforce/Recca.

<br />Can you beat a Megaman game? Can you beat Silver Surfer? How long does it take you to beat each game?

<br />
<br />Really Ninja Turtles, they must be joking, every single Ninja Gaiden game alone is atleast 10 times harder, so is Contra(unless you use the cheat).

<br />
<br />Yes, you have to search a few ground tiles for crests.  No, this does not make the game difficult at all.  You have an item that is essentially a "crest detector" and the location of each one is hinted at or told to you throughout the game.

<br />The stages are named after the greek letters, so it should have 24(?) stages. 
<br />But yeah, it's a hard game. I played it a lot as a kid because a friend of mine had it. I don't think I ever made it past stage 10. Another friend of mine got to stage 13 or 14 a couple of times IIRC, but then he bit the dust too.
<br />
<br />Star Force has to be one of the games with the easiest and least creative bosses though <img src="./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" /> Just squares with a letter in the middle. Dodge right, dodge left, shoot it a bunch of times. Done.

This was a problem in some Pokemon games, where the player could run out of cash after having defeated all trainers in an area because unlike trainers, defeated wild monsters don't always drop l3wt that the player can <a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VendorTrash" class="postlink">pawn off</a>.<br /><br />Or unless the monsters' levels <a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DynamicDifficulty" class="postlink">scale with the party's</a>.

<br />A lot of older RPGs and adventure games have their hints in Engrish, making them hard for the player to decipher. "Eastmost Peninsula is the Secret" anyone?

<br />Ah ha, you never played it. It's clear you never heard of the Road to Rhome atleast(or you quit shortly after reaching the cave)?  
<br />
<br />It's a cave that is impssibly hard, near the bottom there is like 3 huge floors, with pitfalls everwhere, and 4 cell pillars making it near impossible to make a map.
<br />
<br />That's the hardest thing, but then you have to deal with the Monster AI as well, which basicaclly says, attack the weakest char, until It's dead(which also happens to be your healer most of the time, so you are screwed), and all the dugeons, not just the final dungeons are long, and pretty maze like. The ending is no joke either, so yea It's a "HARD" game over all.
<br />
<br />
<br />"No RPG is Hard" Looks like someone doesn't play many RPGs to begin with, because you're talking out of your ***, you have no idea what you are talking about. there are a bunch of insanely hard(legitimately hard, not just time consuming) RPGs. Faria, the Wizardry series, DW 2, Might &amp; Magic 3 and 7th Saga is pretty hard as well.
<br />
<br />PS. I like how you ignored my Wizardy 1, and 2 entry, which also happen to be RPGs. Go ahead try to say that a game that deletes char, and autosave everywhere Isn't hard. My guess is, you picked DW2 to go after, because It's a JRPG(and the fact that all the other DW games are fairly easy doesn't help either), so people that haven't played it, will assume It's not hard(since most JRPGs are downright easy), not to mention there's a watered down remake of the game as well.
