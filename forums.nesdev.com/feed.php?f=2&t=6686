However, I didn't want to spend hours picking the game apart when right now I'm just making sure that the base product works and you know that you can modify it with a little bit of effort.<br /><br />The entire process was to compile and modify NESrev to disassemble games. Find a assembler that works with the output and that goal has been reached so far with NESrev. Now I'm going to try and mess with 32K games once I have time.<br /><br />Maybe later I'll take one game and make it more readable and with a better chance of modifying. With the 16K games, that should be a snap since you can easily expand to 32K.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=43">Gil-Galad</a> — Tue Jul 27, 2010 7:04 pm</p><hr />

I have very good news. I tried assembling with ASM6 and it was a complete success with very little modification. Here is the results from <a href="http://gilgalad.arc-nova.org/junk/projects/DonkeyKong_asm.zip" class="postlink">Donkey Kong</a>. I even did a compare from the original ROM and there was no difference.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=43">Gil-Galad</a> — Tue Jul 27, 2010 12:41 pm</p><hr />

Thanks a lot, Hamtaro. However there is a problem. None of the files on that site will download past about 200KB and thus I get a corrupted file. There has been a couple sites that I've ran into like that even though it's really rare. Not sure why that happens. <br /><br />If you or someone could host those files somewhere so I can download them at a different place, I'd greatly appreciate it.<br /><br /><a href="http://neotoxin.moccamagic.com/XORcyst.htm" class="postlink">XORcyst</a><p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=43">Gil-Galad</a> — Mon Jul 26, 2010 12:49 pm</p><hr />
