<br />
<br />Regarding that one part of Sonic 3, haha yeah I too have memories of getting stuck at that point for a little while, but you really just gave up? I'm not meaning to insult you or anything, but by contrast, I was probably stuck for about 10 minutes before I figured out that you need to hold up and down. I mean, it's not like Sonic 3 used a complicated control scheme. I just tried everything until I figured out what to to do. 
<br />
<br />Maybe you're best suited for modern games that explicitly give you tutorials and hints every thirty seconds. 
<br />
<br />Don't get me wrong, I like modern games as much as the next guy, but I hate it when games these days use artificial aids that discourage problem solving by giving you the answers to solutions or making the answers so blatantly obvious that there's no way you could miss them. 
<br />
<br />From the big progression arrow in Bioshock to button prompt reminders in Batman Arkham City these things are what ruins the experience for me. 
<br />
<br />It's completely the difference between Metroid on NES and Metroid Fusion on GBA. I do not EVER want to be told where to go or what to do; I want to figure out how to progress on my own.

<br />
<br />It's very rare that I play something that doesn't at least mildly insult my intelligence as a player these days.
<br />
<br />But these are of course, just my opinions. It's completely fine if you don't agree and your top 100 would be very different from mine.

<br />
<br />Ironically enough, his jokes about Roll stopping to give advice really DO exist in the PS1 Rockman Complete Works ports as well as Megaman Anniversary Collection for last gen consoles. I don't think he played them or he would have mentioned the connection. It's eerie.

<br />I want a DECENT hint if I'm totally stuck, but I don't want it forced upon me.
<br />
<br />Skyward Sword is pretty bad in this respect. Fi kept telling me stuff I figured out before she started talking. But I can see how that would be totally useful for people who haven't been playing Zelda their entire lives. 
<br />
<br />I'll play games with a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PDOH5ThvEyk&amp;feature=g-upl&amp;context=G207ef10AUAAAAAAACAA" class="postlink">steep execution curve</a>, or arcade get a high score games or bullet hell games, but if I ever get stuck because I missed a single tree while trying to burn them all instead of the fact that I didn't time things well I'm finding something else to do. In one, I'm stuck because of something where I can see the mistakes I am making. In the other, I am guessing. If I wanted to guess I could play the lottery or something.
<br />
<br />I'll play games that beat you down, but never ones that get you lost.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Yeah. Megaman 2 is a complete labour of love. It also features many ideas and enemy concept art originally intended for the first game, but abandoned because of space limitations. Megaman 2 uses a CHR double the size of the first game with more than twice the number of sprites from Megaman 1. Also pointed out by ROM hackers, there are stage remnants from Megaman 1 levels such as Bombman's stage within Megaman 2, meaning the game was build using the same code right over the original, again explaining how the hell it could have possibly be finished in a mere three months. 
<br />
<br />Unfortunately, Megaman 3 didn't have this luxury - it was build from the ground up and required a much longer development period, but Capcom were very anxious to get it out as soon as possible and were placing enormous pressure on Inafune and his team. Many ideas intended were Megaman 3 were left unimplemented simply because of rushed development. 
<br />
<br />If Megaman 3 had've been fully realized, if everything that was intended for it was in the game working 100%, I have no doubt in my mind it would have made Megaman 2 pale in comparison, but judging from their released versions, Megaman 2 has the polished edge over #3.
