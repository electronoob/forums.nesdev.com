<br />
<br />yeah. hell, you could even compile to 16-bit real-mode code and you probably wouldn't see a bit of difference between that and 32-bit.

<br />It's just that the 64-bit operating systems shipped on PCs nowadays have dropped support for 16-bit modes. Home versions of Windows went 32-bit in 1995 (Windows 95) and 64-bit in 2006 (Windows Vista). I wonder how long latest version of majority OS will continue to support 32-bit code without needing a separate copy of the operating system run in a virtual machine.

<br />
<br />if you're very clever, you could probably figure out a way to get a small boost with 64-bit regs; maybe in some video filtering/stretching algorithm or something, but there is nothing in the basics of NES emulation that is going to benefit.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I found that QuickNES was a good 50% faster when built with MSVC 64-bit, compared to 32-bit. Of course that was in 2009, so it was obviously built with MSVC 2008.
<br />
<br />For example, running Battletoads (U) into a null output with no throttling, for 4 seconds:
<br />
<br />32-bit:
<br />Performance: 8684 frames per second, which would use 0% CPU at 60 FPS
<br />
<br />64-bit:
<br />Performance: 12621 frames per second, which would use 0% CPU at 60 FPS
<br />
<br />
<br />Did I mention that QuickNES also benefits from having more registers to play with?
<br />
<br />
<br />I should recompile these benchmark tools with MSVC 2010, and also see if the cycle count changes I've made since then affect anything much. Also note that GCC 64-bit, at least when I tested it back then, performed barely better than the MSVC 32-bit build.
<br />
<br />Any better suggestions for a demo or test or whatever which would be more taxing on the emulator, without requiring any user input?
<br />
<br />Of course, all this is irrelevant for real-time emulation, until you get to the high speed fast forwarding and movie seeking that QuickNES also supports, enhanced by keeping snapshots every 5 minutes or so.
