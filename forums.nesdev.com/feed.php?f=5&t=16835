So I used to play Baseball Stars all the time when I was little. But it was hard to get started on a new team (I didn't know about the <em>WHAT IS A WREN?</em> secret).<br /><br />Anyway, I'd save my game, hold reset, and power off the system. But I guess I didn't do that right one time (or a number of times)? As I was playing, I noticed on my custom team I had an extra player on the RELIEF PITCHER screen. <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_eek.gif" alt=":shock:" title="Shocked" /><br /><br />This pitcher did not appear on the roster under VIEW TEAM, but was present on the RELIEF PITCHER screen from then on after saving.<br /><br />Has anyone had any weird situations like this one with Baseball Stars or any other saving game? And is there a way I could replicate this in emulation?<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=984">Jedi QuestMaster</a> â€” Fri Dec 15, 2017 7:04 pm</p><hr />
