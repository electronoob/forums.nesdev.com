You're the man Kevin, thank you very much ^^ The main purpose for me to build your device, is the fact that I have few undumped famicom games, Ihope it would be possible to dump them.<br /><br />And one thing, I don't want to open a new topic, so I ask here - is there any schematic for NSF Cart for CopyNes ? or would it be possible to just add a 62256 with a CR2032 instead of the rom in mapper 0 cart ? I'd love to build one <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /> nullsleep made a great job making the tutorial of how to convert the nsf to rom, and then put it onto the cart, but with time it is getting annoying, constant flash programming...So having such neat device which CopyNes undoubly is, would be a shame not to have the NSF Cart for it...<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=332">kojiroh</a> — Mon Mar 13, 2006 5:04 am</p><hr />
