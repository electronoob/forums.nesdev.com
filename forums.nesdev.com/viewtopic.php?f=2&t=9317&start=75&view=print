I'm more interested in learning proper implementation in hardware.<br /><br />I'm a programmer with two left brains, not an artist. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />Doing 32 versions of the rocks in primitive tools was repetitious and brain damaging  bad enough. I have since cleaned up my nametable to use only 16 tiles instead of 32 and will be in the process of switching to a 1k animated CHR bank.<br /><br />No going to bother with secondary things like shadows until I have a pretty enough tile set and map to be worth the extra polish.

Reduce this, and it fits more tiles into the editing area.<br />Get the editing area to be 32x32 pixels, then hit the &quot;Shift to Right&quot; button.  Instant shifted graphics.  Just need to copy paste a bunch of times, and hit it again.<br /><br />It's a two minute job to copy-paste-shift in YY-CHR.

Name table editors usually work screen-by-screen, and there are no generic map editors that I know of for the NES. This subject comes up every once in a while, but every time we discuss this we come to the conclusion that a generic map editor that satisfies the needs of all different kinds of games would be too complex to make, and nobody feels like trying.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Yeah, one would generally need to make a custom map editor for a specific game. That's possible, but first I'd have to know what data format your engine is using. Or if you haven't figured that out yet, first I'd have to see what an entire map might look like, along with how wide and tall they're allowed to be, so that I can help you design a data format.

Lots of levels have 3 or 4 splits onscreen for multiple large moving objects. I can't think of any other NES game that goes quite so far with it. I don't think it ever does CHR and split effects at the same time, though.

And it can even be done without the luxury of CHR bankswitching and scanline counters.</div><br /><br />One side is stationary in the name table but slightly off screen.  Scroll towards it 4 pixels at a time while adding 1 column of 8 pixel tiles in the name table to the leading edge of the opposite side with each scroll. Thus it looks like both sides are coming at you at an equal speed of 4 pixels at a time from both sides.  Use sprites (the spikes) to cover up the resulting attribute table artifacts every other frame as a result of updating 8 pixel tiles at a time on the one side.<br /><br />Finally animate the BG tile so that it appears static while scrolling. Two frames of each tile at pixel offset 0 and 4 will do. This part does require CHR ROM bank switching in order to update that many BG tiles instantly.  Everything else is just name table updates, scrolling, and hiding the attribute table artifacts,  really no different from what you do when scrolling and updating tiles in a side scroller.<br /><br />It is impressive though, how simple it is.  I think I might try that tonight real quick.

With a pattern as repetitive as that it would be trivial to upload the appropriate tiles to CHR-RAM every frame. Or you could even use a 4-pixel wide pattern instead and not change the background at all.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">I think I might try that tonight real quick.</div><br />Maybe you should try a vertical variant (columns of spikes coming from the ceiling), just to be a little original. You just have to be careful in order to not line up more than 8 sprites in a row.
