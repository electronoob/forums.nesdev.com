<br />Seeing from you saying '"MY" squeedo mapper', are you the one who is in charge of assigning a new mappers?
<br />If so, can you create a new mapper for the 8k PRG rom-ed games like Galaxian (Japan) from the no-intro set? These games has a very easy mapper(just 4 mirroring of 8kB) to implement, but current iNes mappers have no matching for it.  
<br />This thread at no-intro has more info about it:

<br />
<br />If I'm not mistaken, the extended header of iNES includes PRG ram bank
<br />infos stepping 8k-wise, not the rom which is still stepped 16k-wise. 
<br />Also, the clrMamePro's default header checker for NES doesn't provide 
<br />support for the extended headers that use 0008h ~ 000fh. You can check 
<br />this at &lt;clrmamepro dir&gt;\headers\nes.xml, if you have installed the 
<br />clrmamepro
<br />
<br />Surely changing the behavior of mapper 0 based on the PRG rom size 
<br />can be another way to solve the problem. But it would introduce some programming overhead for the mapper 0. 
<br />
<br />I still think it is more preferable to add an extra mapper for the Galaxian, 
<br />especially it is the only one of their kind. We have a lot of mappers to 
<br />spare, so why not waste them <img src="./images/smilies/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt=":roll:" title="Rolling Eyes" />

<br />
<br />- The only difference I see is about saving or not saving the data at 6000-7fff region. If the iNES has backed battery bit set, the data is saved. Anyway, that region is read/write, except for the mappers that brings the explicit info "no RAM at 6000-7fff".

<br />
<br />Yeah the game can be that size, but those EPROM sizes are long obsolete and could conceivably cost more than 50 times as much as a 64kB one.  So someone would almost have to be big into scrapping old electronics to use those.  They'd be found on really old arcade game boards, at least.

<br />You are missing the point. Mirroring is not just a software issue. It DOES require extra wiring in actual hareware, at minimum. Because of this, mirrored chip and non mirrored chip is, however slight the difference is, HARDWARE-wisly different, . It is not a HACK to creat a new mappers for the hardware-wisly different chip, but was just a matter of convinience to merge similar hardwares into one mapper.
<br />
<br />I'm just saying that since we now have a certain type of chip that is not working under currunt system, let's create another mapper and wait for the emu authors to apply them.  I don't understand why you are calling this as a HACKY approach.

Instead of just using a 16K PRG ROM image (mirrored), which should be in turn mirrored again by the emulator, you want to implement another NROM mapper specifically to detect malformed ROMs of a specific size. I call that a hack since it modifies the standard behavior of the PRG block count. Perhaps 8K ROMs should have been considered by the iNES format, but also perhaps there are unlimited shortcomings of iNES and it's silly to just now crusade over one one that has been known forever and is easily ignored since it affects nothing.

<br />
<br />Yes, it DOES require wiring, and you are still missing the point.
<br />In order for the mirroing to occure, the top most addresses need to be HARD-WIRED together. 
<br />
<br />You can say that the actual wire numbers are less for 8k, which is of course more roms have more pins to wire,  but what I mean by extra wiring is the Hard-Wiring requirement for the unused top address.
<br />You may consult 6502 document for the better details about how the hard-wiring works to fulfilling 16bit address ranges of 6502 with lesser memory units.

<br />
<br />That is a side effect of using the wrong hardware. If you had an 8kB ROM there would be no top-most address lines to need to connect.
<br />
<br />Since the current Galaxian rip falsely claims 16kB ROM, it comes pre-mirrored in the iNES file, and, in turn, if you just put that in a 16kB ROM it would also just work, without any hard-wiring of upper address lines.

<br />
<br />Rom-wisely, you are right, but the CPU still has A11 ~ A15 which is connected to the P1(catridge slot) of NES. The catridge must have some form of wiring to handle those address lines, such as making them an open field, hardwiring to the ground, and so force...
<br />
<br />Since this unneeded lines(A15 has actual use as a PRG/CE) are still accepted and handled by the rom chip set, I consider this as a mapper information. 
<br />
<br />And, if one type of mapper information cannot be handled by the currunt mappers, then what is wrong with creating another mapper to handle them? If some already-existing mapper can incorporate a new mapper information, surely we can merge this to the already-exising mapper for the convinience and to spare mappers for future use.
<br />
<br />But we all know that the 8kB chips are, due to iNes header limitation, very difficult to be handled by mapper 0. So I'm saying let's creat new mapper for it and all the problem will be solved with the least affort possible. I just don't understand why this approch are being attacked as "a Hack" by a certain person.
