		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I have a <strong>non-working</strong> Famicom Disk System for sale / donation.  Includes original box + foam + manual and the FDS-to-FC cable/adapter.  Sorry, no AC adapter...
<br />
<br />DONATION: I'll donate this (free of all costs, including shipping) to someone in the nesdev scene who is serious about fixing it and putting it to good use (reverse engineering).  I'll be picky about who it goes to, since I do want it to have a good home.  I'd be really prone to donate it to someone who's working on audio stuffs (so, blarg, Disch, loopy, Memblers, and probably many others), since the FDS does in fact have its own set of sound registers and the like.
<br />
<br />SALE: I'd like US$15-20 for it (plus you pay S/H).  US/CAN only (sorry Euros, but I go through customs hell every time I ship something that goes through Germany's customs depot...).
<br />
<br />Just for the record: I'd rather this be donated than be sold, but for all I know most in the nesdev scene have FDS units.  <strong>I DO NOT WANT THIS THING SITTING AROUND COLLECTING DUST</strong> -- please do fix it!
<br />
<br />
<br />Details:
<br />
<br />I received this FDS as a Christmas gift from bpoint a couple years ago, so it does have some sentimental value to me.  I got around to testing it out a few weeks ago, and found that the drive belt had completely melted around the drive motor spindle (and some other remains tossed all over the inside of the enclosure).  I cleaned the spindle using Q-tips and 99% isopropyl alcohol; it's nice and clean at this point.  I then purchased a brand new replacement FDS belt off eBay (cost me about US$37 including shipping), and installed that.  Still no love.  :-(
<br />
<br />The system reports ERR 21, 22, or 27.  ERR 21 (I believe) represents disk header not found, and 22/27 are drive motor too slow/too fast.  I've tried properly adjusting the drive motor, but it's made no difference.  So either the head is problematic or there is some other mechanical or electrical problem which remains that I cannot solve.
<br />
<br />I know my FDS disks are in 100% working condition; I've since bought a working FDS, and all my disks work great on that FDS.
<br />
<br />So hopefully someone with more experience can repair this little bugger and put it to good use.  You can find FDS disks for sale via eBay almost all the time, so there's no shortage of those...

<br />Just a question, but where did you buy your new FDS?
<br />
<br />I've been looking to find a working FDS for a while now so that I can dump some disks, but without much luck.  My old drive gave out just as I finished building Brad Taylor's FDS-&gt;PC interface, and I haven't been able to repair the drive yet.

You just pay for shipping.  If the belt is no good, then I'll have to order one so that will cost money but if the belt is fine then it needs adjustment.
<br />
<br />Let me know.  I fixed 2 systems already.

<br />Holy crap.  Haven't seen YOU around in awhile.  :D  I didn't even know you were living here, I swore you were out east, in Massachusettes if I remember correctly...
<br />
<br />I'll gladly hand the FDS over to you.  Let me know -- I can ship it to you (shouldn't cost much, especially since it's local) or you can drop by and pick it up.  I work graveyard shift, so meeting up with me is somewhat of a pain... :-(
