If it's an illustration, I'll stare at it for a good while thinking about all the little details, if it's an animation, I'll leave it looping for hours. If it's something interactive, like a webpage component or a game engine, I'll stress it to no end, doing everything as frenetically as I can, and feel good that it doesn't break.

Sometime the song feels good enough and it stick but no time to write it down. Or is slowly start to get an image with specific instrument but I know I couldn't reproduce it that way. So I can only play it &quot;in my head&quot;. <br /><br />Or worse, have a good idea and cannot hum it down/write it down and be lost forever. That I hate a lot.

I can't sing worth crap though, so usually I ended up with at least the rhythm to my idea!

Humming or whistling in public is generally acceptable, but I can see it being a problem if you work in a quiet office or something.

Conversely though, you can end up in an instance where if you listen to something long enough that you thought about changing, but didn't, then it sounds natural to you, so you end up not knowing if you should've changed it and it would've sounded better or not. Always with the decisions to make : P
