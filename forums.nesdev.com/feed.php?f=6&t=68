Yeah, I agree.  I guess the extra timer makes some sense in a situation where sound code uses some external IRQ, but maybe it's better off being emulated or otherwise present "normally" in that case anyways.  (still needs the hardware to play on the system, same as with extra soundchips and such)<br /><br />There is accomodation for non-stock stuff in NSF format though, like the play speed if someone wants to do 30hz, 120hz, or whatever.  It's just not used often or at all.  I've only ever seen a couple NSFs use 30hz (I think 720° and Chase HQ).<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=10">Memblers</a> — Sat Apr 30, 2005 5:02 pm</p><hr />

Rad Racer 2, Final Fantasy 3 and SD Gundam 4 works fine, even while using $4011. Yeah, they writes to it only twice a frame, and not always like Battletoads &amp; cie.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=38">Bregalad</a> — Sat Apr 30, 2005 9:13 am</p><hr />

Uh, I don't believe you need to keep updating the OAM with $4014, it should stay up from the PPU constantly accessing it. So, I guess if you turn the PPU off the OAM might decay or something.<br /><br />After all, BB H&amp;S, only updates the OAM if a sprite moves (if any of the 256 bytes of the $4014 "sprite page"), so if nothing with sprites change the game won't update sprites. Interestingly though, while Big Bird talks, his beak animates and the game constantly updates sprite ram via $4014, while using $4011 to make him talk.<p>Statistics: Posted by Guest — Sat Dec 25, 2004 11:31 pm</p><hr />

I've always wondered how games such as Battletoads and Big Bird's Hide and Speak update the sprites during raw pcm playback through $4011 without making a 512 cycle drop-out in the sound, or at least how they keep the OAM (which appears to be a DRAM without an automatic refresh) from decaying.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=9">tepples</a> — Sun Nov 28, 2004 8:30 am</p><hr />

DPCM isn't the problem - hundreds of NSFs support that without a problem (this includes 'Robot Block'). DPCM is what most games use for 'lower quality' PCM samples, like the drums in most game music (think SMB3) or other background sounds (like the cheering crowd in Punch-Out!!).<br /><br />The problem is 7-bit RAW PCM, which requires the program to manually write the waveform to a particular register 1 byte at a time. Such NSFs would have to be designed to loop forever within their init routine or something, which the NSF format itself does not strictly allow (and, as such, most players do not support it).

It is a fact that many NES games had voice samples.  They may not have sounded very pleasant due to low sampling rates, little storage space and a 7-bit volume limitation, but they were there.  This makes me ask why in the NSFs of games that had them they are consistently left out?  In NSFs of games like High Speed and Bad Dudes, no sound.  Even in earlier games like Bayou Billy, Ikari Warriors II and even Karate Champ, no samples.  Why can't Rob Hubbard's Skate or Die II intro be put on the NSF when every good emulator can play it without a hitch?  The only NSF I could find that has the voice samples contained within it is the one for Robot Block, a.k.a. Stack-Up.  (Probably the earliest use of the PCM channel.)  Perhaps the NSF format isnot robust enough to handle all the NES's APU.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=58">Great Hierophant</a> — Sun Nov 28, 2004 2:01 am</p><hr />
