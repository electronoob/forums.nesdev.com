		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Hi, I am currently putting together a technical demo, and my demo requires that I switch banks. Like, alot. And I'm currently putting this demo together with NESASM, because my other assembler is a little more difficult to set up, and I'm not too familiar with some of the options. But I'm having trouble bankswitching with NESASM. Also, I'm not sure which bank to put what in while having multiple banks. Like if I set the inesprg bank number to 4, which bank does the vector go in? I've tried alot of things, and the screen just goes grey, and there's no graphics loaded, no pallete, no code was going on. I'm using CHR-RAM, incase that helps. Will someone help me? thanks.

So put your vectors in the last bank.
<br />
<br />You're using CHR RAM, but are you using CHR RAM on UNROM, SNROM, or AOROM? It makes a difference.

Yeah, that's bad, I should've probably looked a while ago. So if I have 4 prg banks, I'd use bank 7 for vectors, and I tried using bank 6 to org at $C000, and that worked, but I'm not sure why. This is in NESASM terms, remember. I'm lost.

<br />
<br />Myself, I never understand the purpose of NESASMs bank numbers even for small roms..
<br />
<br />BTW, SNROM etc. are the names Nintendo gave their cart PCB types.  See how many different types there are for MMC1?  heheh
<br /><a href="http://tripoint.org/kevtris/mappers/mmc1/" class="postlink">http://tripoint.org/kevtris/mappers/mmc1/</a>
<br />But from a coding point of view, they're mostly the same except the memory types, so don't worry about it too much.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />So maybe I should just try making my demo on Wla-Dx, which is my other assembler? And when switching banks, you can just select a new bank, and org it at $8000 or $C000? And you just have one hard-wired bank of PRG, which is like bank 1, or whatever tepples said up there? So I could just go like this:
<br />
<br />.bank 0
<br />.org $8000
<br />
<br />.....
<br />
<br />.bank 1
<br />.org $C000
<br />
<br />....
<br />
<br />.bank 2
<br />.org $8000
<br />
<br />....
<br />
<br />.bank 3
<br />.org $C000
<br />
<br />.....
<br />
<br />.bank 3
<br />.org $FFFA
<br />
<br />If that were my bank limit? Keep in mind, I'm using CHR-RAM. In the future, my project will be done with SUROM. But this is just a tech demo. I was wondering though, Why does it say 8k CHR RAM for SUROM on the MMC1 thing you showed me? Couldn't there be more CHR RAM? It's embedded in PRG, so what's the deal? Yeah, me and Bregalad are working on something really big, so it will need SUROM. He's doing the sound, I'm coming along on the engine for the game. But will that thing above work? I'm still a little lost. If I could be just a little more cleared up, I'll be good. Thanks a bunch! <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Sorry, if anyone was dissapointed that I brought up this subject, but I am currently having problems with bankswitching. In Wla-Dx, I was able to first of all, make a 64k PRG 8k CHR Hello World demo, but I was also able to put my vectors in bank 1, and put my reset code in bank 0. But I'm still confused. Here is my set up:
<br />
<br />bank 0 - reset $8000
<br />bank 1 - code $C000
<br />bank 2 - ? PRG space
<br />bank 3 - ? PRG space
<br />bank 4 - CHR data
<br />
<br />How do I switch from bank 0 to bank 2/3? Can I just like randomly put "bank 2 org $8000" in the middle of my reset routine? or what?
<br />
<br />EDIT: Is anyone alive anymore?

<br />If your assembler assumes 8 KB banks, and your mapper uses 16 KB banks, then you'll only be able to swap those banks in and out as a pair.

<br />
<br />LDA #$nn
<br />STA $8000
<br />LSR A
<br />STA $8000
<br />LSR A
<br />STA $8000
<br />LSR A
<br />STA $8000
<br />LSR A
<br />STA $8000
<br />
<br />What should #$nn be? And am I understanding correctly that you WRITE to the registers to LOAD them? And, this is kind of a dumb question, but why do you need to write to these registers?

<br />To switch bank 3's data into $8000-$BFFF without any modifications to register 0? And could you just change swappable banks to 32k via register 0 to swap 2 16k banks at a time? Like swap banks 0 and 1 with 2 and 3? Not like swap 0 and 1 with 6 and 2, though, right? Am I understanding this correctly?
