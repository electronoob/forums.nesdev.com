Later I was able to use the 65c02 and its improvements over the NMOS '02 gave me a greater sense of freedom.  Later I got into the 65816 which I actually found <em>easier</em> than the '02 because its wider registers and added instructions and addressing modes removed the limits.  It was so nimble at things the '02 was either clumsy at or incapable of.  But if it seems daunting, you can use it exactly as a 6502 to start, and then start using the extra capabilities little by little.</div><br />I think long addressing might be somewhat confusing to beginners because certain instructions/addressing mode are missing like lda $xxxxxx,y.  You pretty much have to use the bank register as the bank byte for Y, and use long addressing for stuff you'd normally use absolute addressing for.</div><br />True, not every indexed and indirect addressing mode is available in 24-bit.  (Actually, they're not all available in 16-bit on the '02 either, like that there's no <tt style="margin-left: 2px; margin-right: 2px; padding:3px; background-color: #3355aa; color: white;">LDA &#40;abs&#41;,Y</tt>).  Also, the two bank registers are only 8 bits each (the high 8 bits, specifying a bank), meaning you can't use them as fine-grained index registers.  However, the '816 still gives you a ton of benefits even if you never go outside the first 64KB of address space and never touch the bank registers.  Going beyond that, the thing is to make banking work <em>for</em> you rather than <em>against</em> you.<br /><br />There's no <tt style="margin-left: 2px; margin-right: 2px; padding:3px; background-color: #3355aa; color: white;">LDA $xxxxxx,Y</tt>, but there <em>is</em> an <tt style="margin-left: 2px; margin-right: 2px; padding:3px; background-color: #3355aa; color: white;">LDA $xxxxxx,X</tt> and <tt style="margin-left: 2px; margin-right: 2px; padding:3px; background-color: #3355aa; color: white;">LDA $xxxxxx</tt> and <tt style="margin-left: 2px; margin-right: 2px; padding:3px; background-color: #3355aa; color: white;">LDA [dp]</tt> and <tt style="margin-left: 2px; margin-right: 2px; padding:3px; background-color: #3355aa; color: white;">LDA [dp],Y</tt>.  Altogether there are 34 addressing modes (if you separate <tt style="margin-left: 2px; margin-right: 2px; padding:3px; background-color: #3355aa; color: white;">RTS</tt>, <tt style="margin-left: 2px; margin-right: 2px; padding:3px; background-color: #3355aa; color: white;">RTL</tt>, <tt style="margin-left: 2px; margin-right: 2px; padding:3px; background-color: #3355aa; color: white;">RTI</tt>, etc.), in 255 op codes.  The stack-relative addressing modes (along with 16-bit registers) open up new possibilities, and a further cool addition is that you can adjust the starting point of the &quot;direct page&quot; (like zero page, but you can make it start <em>anywhere</em> in the first 64K), even making it overlap the stack area, so you can get direct-page addressing modes even in the stack.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />1) TI-BASIC<br />My first programming language was TI-BASIC on a TI-99/4A.<br />It was fun as a 2nd grader to take the program listings in books and type them in, and then modify the programs for different results (colors, graphics, sounds). The manual of the TI-99 stresses there's no way to break the computer, so don't worry and just power cycle. Imagine if computers were like that now?<br /><br />My interest was more in digital electronics and just playing video games so I put it on hold for a while.<br /><br />2) TI-BASIC (calculators)<br />Then I had a stint of BASIC-like programming with the TI graphing calculators, mandatory for math class. I know I said this before but one of the most popular games floating around junior high school (a moon lander) became uncool when they realized *I* wrote it. People can be so cruel.<br /><br />3) QBasic<br />When I finally got an IBM compatible PC, it was a Packard Bell Pentium computer. Thank $deity that buried on one of the CD's there was QBasic. I eventually was doing 3D math (line art), and then later filled (but untextured) polygons. I also figured out the math behind Mode-7 on the SNES to pull from a texture map. Also whoever came up with WAIT &amp;H3DA, 8 for waiting for Vsync to slow down the programs (instead of a large for-loop) is a genius. I actually think it was in the help file?<br /><br />4) Commodore BASIC<br />At a garage sale, I bought a used VIC-20. That thing was awesome and BASIC programs really flew in comparison to the TI-99. Started learning about peek and poke to really make some ridiculously cool looking effects. Downside was the 3K of memory available. Upside was the schematic and datasheets for all the chips were included!<br /><br />5) 68K Assembly (no really)<br />Again more interested in digital electronics I built a 68K computer and hand-assembled code for it as a junior and senior year high-school independent study project. I programmed the first test EPROM on a breadboard with dip switches and jumper wires. I was smart enough to wire the write command with a debounced pushbutton. It was some dumb 5x7 LED matrix scanner, but on the matrix keypad you could use the arrow keys and pick the color of the pixel (off, red, yellow, green). I really credit how open the documentation on the VIC-20 was for allowing me to understand how to create my own computer with a different CPU.<br /><br />6) Z80 assembly.<br />More TI-calculator stuff. Would sometimes hand-write program code bored off my ass waiting for close as a cashier. Ported the SDCC C compiler to the TI-86, my first experience with open-source. Was too dumb to commit back because I had a severe inferiority complex and didn't feel anyone would care. Lost most of everything related to this due to roommates and moving around.<br /><br /><br />At this point I'll stop, as it's beyond the scope of the question. But as an aside, I still get treated like an outsider at work for being one of the only ones to understand programming and low-level computer stuff. I don't understand why coworkers or general managers get bent out of shape if I say a seemingly small but nontrivial code writing task will take 4 days, they make me feel like I'm being dishonest or something. I don't really recommend software programming as a career due to social ostracization.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />1.) I started messing around in game maker when I was around 11-12, and using whatever built-in language it had to slowly learn how to program. It would take anouther 3 years or so to get any good at all with it.<br /><br />2.) Around the time going into high school I started using C++ to make shitty text adventure games (literally using a bunch of if/elses and cin/couts, and I think even some GOTOs since I didn't understand how functions worked.) I knew that NES dev was a thing, but I wasn't smart/experienced enough to figure out how to get any assembler to work.<br /><br />3.) Some time around highschool I began to mess around with Java, but OOP was still too complicated to wrap my head around. So I saved that until I eventually started taking programming classes the school had.<br /><br />4.) I think sometime going into my senior year of HS (2015) I finally learned how to make something functional in 6502 and joined this site.<br /><br />So I guess Java and 6502 assembly are the only two languages I've coded something serious in, haha. But of course I've tinkered around in numerous other languages like Python, C and LISP. Seeing all your guys' responses makes me wish I would have started with Basic. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_cry.gif" alt=":cry:" title="Crying or Very sad" />

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I used QBASIC first, when I was probably 14.  I didn't learn how to program though, by the end of it I maybe had a vague understanding of what a variable is.  I used the built-in help file to learn how to use PRINT and INPUT, with that I made a simple text-based game.. Virtual Reality Gym Class.  Based on my IRL gym class that several of of my friends were in, so it was pretty funny to us.<br /><br />Then I started on 6502 for NES a couple years later.  After that, 65816, SPC700, PIC16, PIC18, toyed around a little with Propeller assembly.  Then finally I learned C, started using it about 10 years ago.  And Verilog, if that counts.  6502 is still what I consider my first language, since my usage of QBASIC was pretty minimal (I'd look at stuff like gorillas.bas and it made zero sense to me).
