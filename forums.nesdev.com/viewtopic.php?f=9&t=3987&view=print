		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I'm trying to make a rom backup of the menu pcb in the FamicomBox.
<br />The menu pcb has 72 pins and looks like a regular NES game pcb.
<br />The problem is that I can't get my "region free" CopyNES to read it.
<br />
<br />I was thinking of using a eprom programmer and reading from the PRG and CHR, but it would be a b**ch to desolder the chips.
<br />Any tech-heads with some suggestions?

<br />
<br />Yes, that correct.
<br />
<br />And according to Kevtris homepage the FamicomBox games has the lockout on different pins than the original carts.
<br />So maybe the menu pcb has it too, but it shouldn't matter since the CopyNES is "region free".

<br />
<br />Yea, I was thinking about making some kind of adapter so I could use the Eprom programmer, but not quite sure how.
<br />
<br />Maybe I could solder some wires from a 72pin connector to a chip socket which I can plug into the Eprom programmer.
<br />
<br />As far as I know there haven't been made any rom of the  FamicomBox or the FamicomStation menu.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Well I think that should work, making an adapter like that as long as you make sure to wire it all up right. I don't see why it wouldn't atleast. You'll have to adjust it though or make two since you have PRG and CHR. 
<br />
<br />But I'm no expert on this. As far as I can reason though if you have all the signals going to the right places it shouldn't have any issues. Just trace each IC leg out to the connector and it should be fine. 
<br />
<br />Another idea, maybe after you trace the signals, you'll find some are moved, so you could take like a game genie and rewire the insides removed the game genie parts) to let your copynes dump it. I think that's the first thing to do though is trace where the signals are going and compare to the normal pinout.

<br />
<br />Looks like the game uses 128 kbit PRG ROM and horizontal mirroring, while the menu uses 256 kbit PRG ROM and vertical mirroring. This can be confirmed as the game's EPROM is a 27C128 while the menu's EPROM is a 27C256.

<br />
<br />Yes, you can dump all SSS carts (even this menu cart) as a normal NROM game on CopyNES.  I dumped my SSS menu and the Famicombox carts I own using it.  I suggest placing the bare board into a random NES cart case though, it works alot better.

<br />
<br />Which mapper should I use?
<br />I see there is a own mapper in CopyNES for FamicomBox menu.
<br />But how can I verify that the dump is successful?
<br />There's no emulator that work with this, or is it?
<br />
<br />I've placed the board into an old SMB3 case and I use a gutted out Game Genie to get good contact all the pins.
<br />At least it works on my FamicomBox games which I had trouble reading with the CopyNES.

<br />
<br />Resistors are attached to extra lockout pins that are passed through the expansion port.  Kev knows the details but the Famicom Box cic works a it different, possibly those are enable lines for the cic in each slot?

<br />
<br />The 3198 lockout chip in the famicombox carts is kinda odd.  The resistor network connects 4 lines from the expansion pins (on the cart) to 4 pins on the lockout chip.
<br />
<br />Unlike the regular lockout chips, the 3198 is designed to work in a network of up to 16 lockout chips.  Each of the 15 cart slots on the front + the menu board has a unique mapping of the 4 lines;  pulled high or low depending on which slot it is in.
<br />
<br />The master lockout chip on the main board has its 4 address lines connected to a latch which is written to by the CPU to select 1 of the 16 slaves on the various carts.  The slave lockout chip matching the desired chip sent out by the master responds, while the other up to 15 chips do not.
<br />
<br />This is how the system addresses each cart's lockout chip to see if a cart exists at that address.  
<br />
<br />On the regular lockout chips (3193, etc) those 4 pins are NC and don't appear to do anything at all.
<br />
<br />The SSS boards are identical to their normal NES- boards except for the extra lockout chip pin routing;  and nintendo was smart and used those  normally useless pins that connected to the expansion port.   There's nothing stopping you from dumping the SSS carts as NES-xxx models if you cut pin 4 of your lockout chip in the NES.
<br />
<br />BTW the pin 4 trick works on the famicombox too, but I wouldn't do it- those lockout chips are pretty damn rare.
<br />
<br />One more side note-  the famicombox also contains a 3199 chip in it.   This is not a lockout chip though, but is the coin timer.  It will flash the screen when your time is about out, at the same rate that the NES' LED would flash <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":-)" title="Smile" />
