Could the NES do something similar?  I know Kickle Cublicle does something similar.<br /></div><br /><br /> What part of Kickle Cubicle?<br /><br /> The sine wave animation? That's just to show that the transparency parts/transitions/edges aren't limited to just straight edges or lines. The hblur effect is to show that it can enabled for just the transparency part (making the light areas fuzzy; aka poorman's glow) - though not for the sprite (only BG areas). The two videos approach the transparency effects in different ways (and have their own advantages/disadvantages). But yeah, both are H-int effects (common called 'linescroll' effects). They can be done on the NES with an external interrupt+timer (or line reader like the mmc3 does IIRC). So they can be done on the nes, and full screen like that, but you'll be cutting into your already limited cpu resource. You're looking at 224-240 interrupts per frame, so multiply that with the amount of cycles the routine takes. Plus you have setup/prep time that you need to add to that (usually a table). On the NES, I'd probably do it every two lines and apply the savings for something else.<br /><br /> There's a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9N4xgkwm154" class="postlink">third video</a>, but it's nothing special that other systems can't already do (other than it's more practical to do since there's a lot of sprite bandwidth per line than they other systems). Both Genesis and PCE can do it, and I believe a couple of games do this trick on both systems. And if I have my fact straight, that trick can also be done on the NES. But the limited sprite bandwidth makes it near impractical do in application on the nes. And, IIRC, you can't do this on the SMS because the BG selects the priority of the sprite instead of the sprite table entry itself (someone correct me if I'm wrong here).<br /><br /> On that note, do any official NES games do that trick (sprite priority-&gt;BG trick)? I mean for transparency/silhouette (and not for popping a piece of the BG over the sprite in dynamic areas).<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3645">tomaitheous</a> — Tue Sep 09, 2014 11:37 pm</p><hr />

Quite a few games were setup to use select in it probably would on the Genesis (quick select/option button). <br /><br /> Some later games used the extra buttons of the 6 button pad, if it was detected. But it was mostly for quick item switching and such (a minor convenience).<br /><br /><br /><br /> As for the SGX, I'd put it above the Genesis (though not by a lot). It has twice the vram (128k), it has a combined 512 sprite pixels per scanline, combined 128 SAT entries, having two BG layers make the 16 of the 32 subpalettes just for BG layers even more usable/capable. The window registers (a priority mixing chip) allows for allows for complex <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dVFfrfvmeY" class="postlink">graphic tricks</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75IdGO1I1o4" class="postlink">transparency shapes</a>. The SGX has the same res modes as the PCE, but making the higher 7.16mhz and 10.74mhz dot clock pixels modes incredibly useful because the heavy sprite scanline pixel bandwidth to back it up. Both res modes are higher than the Genesis. The audio is still the same, but the SGX has a new revision of the audio chip which allows switching on/off channels without 'blips' - allowing you use each of the six channels 32 byte buffer as a PCM sample play back buffer (a 1khz timer routine can do 32khz stream streaming). I had demos up and running in no time doing this - I wonder if dev's would have eventually done this as well. The original audio chip can do this trick too, but you have to use/waste a spare channel to invert the blip (caused by sudden volume change), so it's more practical on the SGX. The Genesis still as a few nice tricks to its own in comparison, but overall all I'd take practical features (vram, sprite bandwidth,etc) over specific case special effects (shadow/highlight, column scrolling, etc).<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3645">tomaitheous</a> — Mon Sep 08, 2014 6:41 pm</p><hr />

Genesis, Game Boy, and Game Boy Advance require games to contain a valid header with the console maker's name as text (Genesis) or image (GB, GBA). This &quot;Trademark Security System&quot; (TMSS) was ruled ineffective in the USA in <em>Sega v. Accolade</em>. Atari 7800 games are flat-out digitally signed, something other companies' consoles wouldn't widely adopt until Xbox. Patent issues?<br /><br />rainwarrior: You have a point about accessibility. For people who can't work a standard controller, it's easier to build a custom controller for a PC game. But then this breaks when a game uses XInput, which works only with Xbox 360 controllers (and with Xbox One controllers since a recent Windows update). All Windows Store games that use a gamepad use XInput, and all Windows RT games are Windows Store games. Therefore, at least for the purpose of controller accessibility, we can lump Windows RT with Xbox 360.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=9">tepples</a> — Mon Sep 08, 2014 6:38 pm</p><hr />

Huh, I could've sworn that a thread here mentioned that, no matter how hard they tried, they couldn't find a pattern, and by extension they couldn't replicate it.  Did other consoles of the time use lockout?  I believe the SMS and 7800 had software based lockout, where they had to look for a string in the code.  I find it ironic Nintendo didn't use a 10NES in the GB and instead opted for a in-code lockout.  Then again, they probably had to save space.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=6132">OneCrudeDude</a> — Mon Sep 08, 2014 8:36 am</p><hr />

I was just gonna mention the NES' 10NES chip.  That was a very effective method of anti-piracy that was difficult for pirates to circumvent.  To this day, no one has deciphered how the chip actually works, and the CIC chip used in repros is allegedly a clone of Atari's Rabbit chip, itself a clone of the 10NES.  That said, it can be easily bypassed by modifying your console, and some companies used voltage spikes to temporarily knock it out.  It was a very effective form of DRM that was also not very invasive.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=6132">OneCrudeDude</a> — Sun Sep 07, 2014 9:13 pm</p><hr />

Piracy is incredibly common. I find it odd that you'd suggest otherwise here, on an NES emulation website. It is extremely common on PC. Less common on consoles, for various reasons. In recent years, the proliferation of online leaderboards has been a huge source of statistics on just how many people pirate games. Example: <a href="http://2dboy.com/2008/11/13/90/" class="postlink">http://2dboy.com/2008/11/13/90/</a><br /><br />The piracy statement is not my rationale, it's the one I most commonly heard from publishers. The second most common thing said was that they expect poorer sales from a PC release, though the piracy problem is considered part of the problem in sales, in this rationale.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=5165">rainwarrior</a> — Sun Sep 07, 2014 9:30 am</p><hr />
