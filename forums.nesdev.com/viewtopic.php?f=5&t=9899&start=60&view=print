They, their consoles and their fanboys sucks so hard !! And why did they have to release so many different console, it's like they released one every year. They released 2 consoles between the NES and the SNES, and another 2 or 3 between the SNES and the Playstation/N64. Seriously. Why hadn't they focused more on quality than quantity ?

It worked for the Mega Drive, their first worldwide success. Nintendo was pretty comfortable with the NES and everyone making games for it, until SEGA released the Mega Drive. That worked for SEGA that time, but unfortunately for them this trick never worked again.<br /><br />The Mega Drive/Genesis add-ons were just plain stupid though. People had to basically buy 2 SEGA consoles in order to play SEGA CD or 32X games, and few people did that. I remember I did kinda want a SEGA CD when I was a kid, but SEGA never showed me anything that made me REALLY want to own one, so I never did.

It only worked for a short period of time (1986-1988), much shorter than the console's lifespan (1983-1994) but nevertheless it worked.<br />So there is other reason behind the failure of the Megadrive's add-ons, every likely the fact they were released too closely with the Saturn, and the PlayStation. Also the SNES was very expensive just when it came out and many people would take the decision to buy one only several years after, and they'd rather buy a SNES than a Megadrive add on to complete their collection. The idea to release 2 add-ons at almost the same time is terrible - if at least they released only the Sega CD, and deleayed the Staturn, it would probably have worked.<br />This is just hypothesis, what I say might be plain wrong (especially considering I don't know much about Sega consoles, because - of course - I am completely biased against them <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /> ).

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />PCE Engine had a really successful addon, and that is most probably the main reason for the MegaCD idea. Only difference is that NEC was pushing the CD instead of cards, while Sega did both CD and cart.<br />There is a very recent review at Sega-16 with one main figure at Sega during the 32X times and there is a lot of good info about why it made sense etc. In the end it still turned into a blunder... but it sold hundreds of thousands, unlike some other flops from others.<br />I do personally think there was no need for either, or the MegaCD should have had its own video out so the DMA to MD VDP VRAM for display bottleneck  gets eliminated, and in the process you can introduce fair bit of extra stuff as far as graphics go. <br /><br />You can do 512 color flat bitmaps with MegaCD though, using the CRAM DMA method I described earlier in this thread. MegaCD side is not halted for the duration of the DMA, so while MD side shows the bitmap, the MegaCD side can render next frame. Chilly Willy is cooking up something around it last time I spoke to him.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />MegaCD could be powered from the MD side, but only on models that do not have carbon covered contacts on the expansion connector... all japanese units have carbon coated connections. Those few ohms of resistance the carbon causes is enough to cause instability when the MCD is powered from MD during seeking operations when power draw is greatest.<br />Scraping off the carbon would fix the problem and that is what I do on my machines to make them behave good on my &quot;single AC brick modded&quot; MegaCD.

Yes it is a mess. Before I had a digital camera, so I'll see if I can get some new pictures. On top of having an oscillator, there's also a circuit to output s-video.
