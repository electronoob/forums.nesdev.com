<title type="html"><![CDATA[FDS and FME7 IRQs - Same, but Different Regs/Addresses?]]></title>

<content type="html" xml:base="http://forums.nesdev.com/viewtopic.php?t=7771&amp;p=78437#p78437"><![CDATA[
I had to post the following because it may be possible to port a FDS game with fewer modifications to FME7, as well as MMC5 as an alternative.<br /><br />One such thing is the IRQs, IRQs is much easier on FME7-compatibles because of it being based off the fact that sunsoft developed on FDS software. <br />(see LostLevels.Org Forums - Sunsoft Dev Disks thread)<br /><br />In the wiki, both FME7 and FDS:<br /><br />$4020-$4021 is the same as $0e-$0f, more likely derived from FDS technology (CPU-based IRQ)<br /><br />$0c must be $81 (%10000001) as opposed to $02 in FDS (%00000010) to enable IRQs, but FDS uses it also for Disk transfer.<br /><br />My own and some from the wiki:<br /><br />FDS IRQs can be read to acknowlage itself, But you must do something else with FME7, <br /><br />This may not be the case, but I am guessing disabling it via #$00 in both $0e-$0f if resetting and #$00 in $0c.<br /><br />Anyone who will make an update to both sections explaining similatiries inbetween the mappers will be appreciated<br /><br />OFF TOPIC EDIT: Also of note is $6000 is swichable ROM as well as RAM, and FDS games use $6000 also, Why not make a use of that when porting it to this mapper?<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=287">Hamtaro126</a> â€” Sat May 21, 2011 10:57 am</p><hr />
