		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />hayabusafmw, don't be confused by those numbers. They are all in kilo<strong>bits</strong>. To convert to kilo<strong>bytes</strong> you have to divide them by 8. Meaning that the chips you bought can only hold 32 kilobytes of data, and you can only play with NROM with that ammount of memory.
<br />
<br />I hope you didn't get the PLCC ones, as No Carrier said, because those use a different package and are not shaped to fit a NES cart.
<br />
<br />If you plan on making UNROM or TxROM devcarts, I suggest you order some AT29C040's while they're in stock. I don't think any NES game (multicarts excluded) ever used more than 512KB for PRG or CHR.

<br />this is what i ordered x4.
<br />
<br />
<br />With IC28 sockets
<br />
<br />
<br />So for the Wiring that you talked about....
<br />
<br />Which should i do ??
<br />
<br />the 1 wire technique or multiple? ....
<br />
<br />I guess ninja gaiden game is the same boat as (megaman?)
<br />both are MMC1....
<br />
<br />so was that the 1 wire trick you wanted me to do?

<br />That's exactly as Memblers said. A14 on the cart edge must be connected to A14 on the chip. You can check that with a multimeter if you have one. If you don't, just buy a cheap one, you must have a way to check contacts if you plan to make devcarts.
<br />
<br />Use the pinouts I posted before to see which pin is which. If A14 is not connected to A14 already, you have to do it.
<br />
<br />The process to install a socket for larger chips on boards like UNROM, TxROM or SxROM will often require more than just one wire. You'll need to compare the pinouts of your Flash with the pinouts of the Nintendo ROM, and make sure that everything is connected to the right place.
<br />
<br />EDIT:
<br /><img src="http://www.nesstuff.kit.net/a14.jpg" alt="Image" />
<br />Just make sure these are connected.

<br />what modification are involved?

There is no way you'll be able to turn it into another board. <span style="text-decoration: underline">With this board you can only run NROM games</span>. Connecting A14 to A14 like I said above is just so you are able to run <strong>all</strong> NROM games, not only the NROM-128 ones.
<br />
<br />To run Megaman 1, you have to get some UNROM cart, install the sockets there and rewire as needed. To run Megaman 2 you need to buy a SGROM cart. To run Megaman 3 and 5 you have to get a TLROM cart.
<br />
<br />Small modifications like turning a CHR-ROM cart into a CHR-RAM cart are possible (although not always simple), but turning an NROM cart into anything  else is pretty much impossible.
<br />
<br />If you didn't get it already: These "-ROM" are the names of the boards, and "MMC1", "MMC2", etc are names of mapper chips. Different boards can use the same mapper. All TxROM boards use MMC3, and all SxROM boards use MMC1, for example. Check <a href="http://www.tripoint.org/kevtris/mappers/mappers.html" class="postlink">this page</a> for info on the different boards and mappers.

<br />
<br />so basicly if i want to Play Megaman 2 i need a megaman 2 (or other cart that used the same...)
<br />
<br />
<br />but i cannot take any cart to turn it into a ''free rom cart''
<br />
<br />I understand more now!:)
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />So for now I don't mind it's a experience <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />
<br />so for now i will live with NROM games..
<br />
<br />how is the modification you talked about possible (about bending the socket leg)
<br />
<br />I will finish this cart
<br />
<br />then i will try to find a Megaman ''ready cart''
<br />to try an other project
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />Like i got a bootleg Famicom Super mario 3 i beleive (i got it in double)
<br />i could do a MMC3 cart right?
<br />
<br />I don't know about the chips tho ... if mine would be big enough ...
<br />
<br />Also i got mario/duck hunt this would be a MMC1 right?...

Do it as you fell like.<br /><br />The safest way would be to bend the pin of the socket up, so that it doesn't touch the board, solder a wire to it and the other end of the wire close to A14 on the cart's edge. But you should check the board first, maybe they are already connected and you don't have to do anything! If they are not, better do the bending thing.<br /><br />I'll get home tomorrow, and maybe I can get a few pics of a bent pin. But I'm sure there are a few online already...<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">Like i got a bootleg Famicom Super mario 3 i beleive (i got it in double)<br />i could do a MMC3 cart right?</div><br />Probably. But since it's a pirate cart, we can't be sure. It might use a faithful MMC3 clone, but it may also use a different mapper, and the game was hacked to work on it. Also, many pirate carts use glop tops instead of regular chips, so there is no easy way to install sockets on such carts.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">I don't know about the chips tho ... if mine would be big enough ...</div>
<br />I already told you that those chips you ordered are only good for NROM. Technically, you can make MMC3 carts with small memory chips, but that would be of no use for you since no commercial games were that small.

<br />I think it uses some weird mapper that no other cart uses. Also, if I'm not mistaken, this cart (even the original one from Nintendo) uses glop tops instead of regular chips, so they're no good for devcarts.

<br />
<br />Some people say it's possible to modify a regular screwdriver by carving the middle part or something, but I never tried that.
<br />
<br />I open my carts by heating the screws with my soldering iron, while forcing the cart open. When the screw is hot enough, it melts the plastic only enough for it to come off. It works great, and doesn't deform tha cart case. I haven't tried to close them again, but I heard it is possible if you use larger screws.

<br />I had a Heavy shreddin cart  (never play this game .)
<br />
<br />it's a mmc1 cart
<br />
<br />opened it like you said (minor damage there)
<br />
<br />then ulsoldered the eproms
<br />
<br />+ made a 10 x i should say 100x better hole in front aswell. ^_^
<br />very proud of that
<br />
<br />the next thing is to know how i will close it ... the screw plastic holder broke while in the process....
<br />maybe electrical tape but it makes cheap.
<br />
<br />
<br />I noticed what you meant there.... the Chr (has more legs like 32)
<br />&amp; the prg (i could use the same chips i had ordered?)
<br />28 pin 
<br />
<br />let me know which fits in there so i will order 2 at least.
