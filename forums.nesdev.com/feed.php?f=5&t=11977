For the league-licensed annual titles that became common in the fourth generation, I'm inclined to agree. But on the NES, what makes <em>Baseball Stars</em> (which I assume isn't a compilation of <em>Baseb</em>, <em>Baseb: The Lost Levels</em>, <em>Baseb 2</em>, and <em>Baseb 3</em>) less worth keeping than classic sports games like <em>Blades of Steel</em> and <em>Tecmo Bowl</em>?<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=9">tepples</a> — Mon Nov 24, 2014 8:56 am</p><hr />

Alright guys; back on topic.<br /><br />I have one more official game to add to this list. It is sort of controversial. Super Mario Bros. 2 USA. Now hear me out. I'm not saying DDP is a bad game, I'm saying its NES counterpart is. <br /><br />1) It lacks originality.<br />2) It lives a lie.<br />3) It is a really odd <em>Mario</em> game.<br />4) ***I feel sorry for the people in Japan, really. In addition to getting DDP on FDS (good thing), they also got a rerelease of this in 1992, named Super Mario USA. It is the exact SAME thing as the NES counterpart PRG1.<br />5) It adds nothing new except Clawgrip, at the expense of the Albino Mouser.<br />6) SFX were cut since the NES does not make use of the FDS' extra channel.<br /><br />--ShaneM<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=5262">ShaneM</a> — Mon Nov 10, 2014 6:56 pm</p><hr />

I personally don't like to dismantle old cartridges, but I think if someone owns a cartridge they can do what they like to it, for the most part. If I wanted that copy of Jaws, I would buy it myself, I don't think we need to reserve it for some future person who wants it. Maybe you just want to smash it up in revenge for what it did to you? I can see a value in that. Go for it.<br /><br />If it's some undumped rarity though, please don't ruin it before you dump it. That's a big exception.<br /><br />I'm more interested in getting emulation up to snuff. If the games are well preserved in terms of function, we're in good shape. The systems and cartridges will all crumble someday, but we can copy the software forever. I think the &quot;feelies&quot; part of it all is mostly for the people who lived it and want to remember. If you never played an NES growing up, getting to see/touch/feel the original format is probably a neat novelty, but not particularly essential as long as the game still plays well. You could go out of your way to hear Chopin on a period instrument, but he sounds great on a modern piano too.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=5165">rainwarrior</a> — Fri Nov 07, 2014 3:22 pm</p><hr />
