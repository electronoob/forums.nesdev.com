I would think not, since category 1 doesn't have, presumably because it is using the cartridge which doesn't have PRG-RAM.<br /><br />You say that for programs with a fixed lower bank, you should make $BFD0-$BFF9 to be unused. But, since it is possible to map the same bank to both 16K areas, might it sometimes be necessary, if such a thing is done, that $BFFC-$BFFD will also be unused (so that the RESET button will work)? If it is mapper 180 then probably it should contain the copy of the reset vector anyways (which will then be overridden, so your game shouldn't read it as data); if it is mapper 28 then it would be explicitly needed to mark this area unused (if you are switching banks in this way), since otherwise it is possible to store miscellaneous data in $BFFC-$BFFD due to the power on state of the game.<br /><br />If the PRG bank mode is being changed at runtime, then it might be necessary for the areas $BFD0-$BFF9, $BFFC-$BFFD, $FFD0-$FFF9, all being marked as unused.<br /><br />Is there any guidelines relating to input devices? I suppose it should normally be using the standard controllers, although you also said that since some games might use mouse connected to both NES ports, that the menu would have to deal with that too, so I suppose it is possible that some games might use that. I suppose it might be the good idea that category 1 and 2 programs should normally be made to support standard controller, and other device (zapper, mouse, keyboard) can be optional use (especially in case of a level-editor, keyboard/tape may be helpful); however, I don't know what your intention is specifically, so perhaps it would be good idea to clarify it, please.<br /><br />The other thing I did not see mentioned, is whether or not mapper 28 has bus conflicts (but it is possible to write the program working either way, if necessary).<br /><br />Just so you know, I do not have any intention to entry at this time (but clearly, it is possible to change my mind).

If you make a mouse or Zapper game, have it fall back to the controller, as I did in Thwaite and Zap Ruder, and as the developers of Baby Boomer, Operation Wolf, On the Ball, and Jurassic Park did. If you make a text adventure, you'll need to make it play smoothly with input menus like on the TI-83 or TI-89, because I don't think any judges will own a Famicom with keyboard.

For each entry, I'd store the reset vector, $80 and $81 settings, and the ROM address of compressed CHR ROM data (if any).

So I'll just leave it blank, I wanted to crop it with a hex editor but I'm not sure if that messes with emulator's behavior because of the iNES header.<br /><br />Another thing, I noticed that the emulator mirrors my 16kb bank at the $8000~$BFFF range, that's normal, right?
