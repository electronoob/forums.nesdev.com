<br />I haven't seen the prototype from all angles, but as it's built around Famicom hardware I find it pretty doubtful it doesn't.

<br />Yes, I mean what I said. Flash is not a perfect storage medium, not even close. Flash is easily one of the worst storage mediums since it's prone to electrical damage, overwriting, block erasal, and most importantly: it attempts to retain a charge indefinitely to determine a bit state.

<br />
<br />And BTW, the cassette deck quite obviously would have been nothing more than a recased Family BASIC Data Recorder which was almost solely used for Family BASIC. The Famicom Disk System also was never used for saving games, unless you mean saving within FDS games?

<br />I suggest you do some reading before you start arguments you won't win.

<br />
<br />Yes, I was talking about saving within FDS games, games that in the US used battery backup or passwords.  50 years is not what I would consider "awesome archival" material, in fact, thats garbage.  Hard disks are prone to failure and in moderate/heavy usage will usually fail within 5 years.  I'm sure newer ones may have a slightly longer life expectancy, but in my past experience a hard drive is far from what I would consider an ideal archival medium.  Also, plop a magnet next to a hard drive and tell me how good the data holds up.  Besides, even if hard disks are magnetic, cassette tapes are garbage.  VHS and cassette tape quality goes to shit over the years and the more you play it, the quicker it degrades.    As for the BASIC thing, you are pulling that completely out of your ass, unless you have documents from Nintendo that clearly state thats what it was for, you don't know any better than I about what it was used for.  Also, I suggest you quit threadjacking about stuff you are pulling out of your ass, this is about Toaster NES, which, BTW, I think the top loader makes more sense as well.  I can see the original being called a "toaster oven" since toaster ovens (at least the ones ive used) have a tray that slides in and then you pull a door down over it, somewhat like the original NES.

<br />
<br />Let's go w/ a nice round number for the transfer rate for the time, say...300 baud.  Now let's say you have an NROM-based famicom title w/ an 8KB CHR-ROM &amp; 16KB PRG-ROM.  It would take over 1 1/3 minutes to load.  This would also mean that Nintendo  would have to put an additional 8KB of RAM into the unit so the PPU can directly access CHR data.  Which seems more profitable:  extra RAM &amp; the loss of at least 20% of the market tired of waiting, or a 60ish pin connector (assuming no EXP pins)?
<br />
<br />EDIT:  Also cassettes can be copied much easier than a Famicom cart.

This encoding uses 4800 cells per second and 16 cells per bit: 0011001100110011 for 0 and 0101010101010101 for 1. But I seem to remember the frequency modulation on Apple II tape being much faster than that, maybe 1000 baud. It and the Acorn encoded a 0 as 0011 and a 1 as 0101. But as Apple became fond of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_code_recording" class="postlink">group code recording</a> once the Disk II was introduced, I'd imagine that data could be packed even tighter with the tech of the era, as in the case of 9-track reel-to-reel tape with five cells per four bits, or 3840 kbps.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">Now let's say you have an NROM-based famicom title w/ an 8KB CHR-ROM &amp; 16KB PRG-ROM.

But even under 3840 bps GCR, loading would still take 51.2 seconds.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">This would also mean that Nintendo  would have to put an additional 8KB of RAM into the unit so the PPU can directly access CHR data.</div>
<br />But it would at least have been standard practice. Every other system with a port-mapped video chip, including the Colecovision and SMS, had CHR RAM. Some systems, such as the Commodore 64 and Apple II, had "unified" RAM that the CPU and video chip shared.

<br />I'm pulling it out of my ass? The AVS keyboard/cassette even have the same layout as the Family BASIC keyboard/cassette! Nintendo always reused unmodified Famicom software when they brought hardware to the NES. If they brought over the Family BASIC keyboard (which is literally called the Family *BASIC* Keyboard) they would have used the software it was intended for: BASIC! AVS was additionally going to be marketted as an inexpensive home computer, which at the time meant.... BASIC! 
<br />
<br />Yes, this is speculation, but all speculations aren't equal! Since my speculation is the common speculation, you should be defending your speculation, not me. I suggest you go to the Nintendo World Store and prove that the device hasn't a cartridge slot and they never planned one.

<br />
<br />Anyway, magnetic tape is still used by pretty much every company nowadays for backup.  Sure, some will use hard drives, but those are small companies.  When you canhold multiple terabytes per tape, you can't beat the price and size.
