		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Is there a game for the NES/Famicom where you control your player character and where there's only one opponent in the game? (Or at least one opponent per level.) Usually, you encounter many opponents in a game. But are there games that are designed in a way that you have only one in each level?<br /><br />Important: I'm not talking about games where the player and the opponent do the same stuff. Fighting games, the duel mode of &quot;Bomberman&quot;, 1-on-1-Basketball or &quot;Pong&quot; don't count. In those games, the opponent is merely a computer-controlled player 2. I'm talking about a game where the computer opponent has different properties and does different things than the player character.<br />As an example, imagine if &quot;Pac-Man&quot; was designed in a way that there's only one ghost and this lone ghost posed a challenge.<br />On the other hand, a game with no ghosts, but with two Pac-Men where it's about eating more pellets than the other guy wouldn't count. That's just two identical player characters where one player happens to be controlled by the computer.<br /><br />Do you know of anything like that for the NES (even if it's Japan-only)?<br /><br />P.S.: Passive obstacles may be included in the game, but they should not behave like classical opponent characters. The barrels in &quot;Donkey Kong&quot; don't match my idea because even though they are supposed to be lifeless objects thrown by the main enemy, they still fill the role of the classic computer while Donkey Kong himself is just a visual aid. The game could work as well if there was a monster generator instead of the ape at the top and the barrels where monsters.

So ... interactive fiction and adventure games, maybe? How do things like Maniac Mansion and Carmen Sandiego strike you?

What ways the developers would come up with to do something like that? Obviously, such a game couldn't be your typical side-scroller, so I'm looking for what creative ideas were implemented.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">tokumaru wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">And why doesn't Punch Out meet the criteria this time?</div><br />O.k., &quot;Puch-Out&quot; is a borderline example, but after all, it's one of the games that I excluded in the beginning: The opponent has the same goal as you. And yes, he has different moves, but so do the characters in &quot;Street Fighter II&quot;. After all, he's just a fighter like you.<br /><br />But sorry, I should have mentioned it: Of course, when the game is about <em>defeating</em> the opponent, when the level ends if you manage to defeat him, yeah, in this case, the question what creative way they came up with to make the game is not that interesting anymore. Because having a one-opponent-level where you have to attack the opponent and he attacks you back, well, it's not that hard to imagine how this could be done. That's the reason why fighters or boss-rush games are not what I'm looking for. I want to see games where the opponent is a danger, maybe even one that can be defeated under certain circumstances, but where the game's objective is still something else than actively attacking the opponent to defeat him.<br /><br />Adventure games or &quot;Maniac Mansion&quot; where &quot;enemy sprites&quot; aren't really an issue in the first place, of course don't count either. Otherwise, you could even name &quot;Tetris&quot;.<br /><br />I'm looking for games like &quot;Pac-Man&quot; or &quot;Donkey Kong&quot; or &quot;Frogger&quot; or whatever, where you move in a certain level and have to fulfill a certain task. But instead of a bunch of enemy sprites that are out to get you, it's only one opponent that tries to kill you. (And maybe some totally passive obstacles like pits or objects that the opponent throws. But as soon as it's something like endlessly rolling barrels on a street, the game is out because those are basically just Goombas with other graphics.)<br /><br />From the games that I'm aware of, &quot;Popeye&quot; comes closest to the concept.<br />&quot;Zooming Secretary&quot; doesn't really have opponents in the classic sense. The coworkers are obstacles that are inconvenient, but you don't have to avoid them at all costs. Your actual opponent in the game is the time.<br />And &quot;Bullblazer&quot; looks more like a game where the opponent is exactly like you, as far as I can judge from a YouTube video, so it goes in the &quot;Pong&quot; and &quot;Bomberman&quot; category.<br />I assume &quot;The first level of Door Door&quot; was supposed to be a joke.
