		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Sorry, I"m still a newb, so these posts are going to continue for a bit.  At the very least, I'm familiarizing myself with Cadaver's and SnoBro's code examples and learning more about the NES all the time.
<br />
<br />Anyway,  I stumbled across this article linked over at hackaday.com:
<br />
<br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.mycgiserver.com/~thelinuxmaniac/isa/">http://www.mycgiserver.com/~thelinuxmaniac/isa/</a><!-- m -->
<br />
<br />The example shown has 32-bit in and 32-bit out capability on an home-built ISA card.  The circuitry is farily straightforward, with a few address decoders and latches to get the job done.
<br />
<br />I figure one could run a few fat ribbons from such a custom PC card, straight to a modified cart or even down to the guts of the console itself (or copynes for that matter).  The extra I/O lines could be used to emulate controllers, and possibly even the power and reset buttons.  
<br />
<br />The result would be a completely closed-loop development station w/o need of an emulator.  <strong>The PC effectively *becomes* the game cartridge, leaving the good 'ol NES hardware to do the dirty work. </strong>
<br />
<br />I guess the PC software side might be somewhat problematic.  While operating out of sync with the NES' internal clock, I guess you'd have to rely on an IRQ or just poll those ports really damn fast.  Also, you'd have to implement mapper emulation, but I suppose that can be harvested from most any emulator project (not to mention .nes file loading).
<br />
<br />Any thoughts out there on this?  Is this just pure fantasy, or could this actually be done?

<br />
<br />Agreed.  However, PCI development is a completely different ball game mostly due to the pin density at the card's edge, and its various modes of operation (see below).  If anything a custom PCI card is intimidating, but not impossible:
<br />
<br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://elm-chan.org/works/pci/report_e.html">http://elm-chan.org/works/pci/report_e.html</a><!-- m -->
<br />
<br />AFAIK, the PCI spec is also closed (as if that ever stopped anyone around here):
<br />

<br />
<br />For those reasons, I figured that ISA would be an easier starting point (but who wouldn't want a PCI card instead, right?).  Plus anyone taking this on wouldn't have to worry as much about trashing an older system. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" />

<br />
<br />Yes that is very true but I don't have ISA slots in my computer any more.  I doubt most of us still do.

<br />
<br />Gotcha.  I'm no EE wizard by any stretch (I'm a software guy really), so I was unaware that there was a proper name for such a thing.  Thanks!
<br />
<br />This also gets part of the way toward a concern I had which was the switching latency involved with emulating a mapper in software.  Again, my lack of education here leaves me stabbing in the dark at this one.
<br />
<br />I guess the problem I'm looking to solve is how to decrease the development iteration time for making a good mapper for use in a custom cart.  I know that the "FunkyFlashCart" and "Squeedo" are around the corner, but who knows when?  In the meantime, I'd like to have something <em>real</em> to develop against but w/o the added turnaound time of reprogramming a fpga *and* roms.

<br />Get yourself an SNROM board (common as dirt: Metroid, Zelda, etc), rewire it for whatever ROMs you prefer, and modify it to read a PRG and CHR segment of up to 8 KB each from the controller port. Then run a cable to your PC's parallel port and send the program that way.
