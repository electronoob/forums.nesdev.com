If the purpose is to ask questions and get the best answer upvoted and then lock the thread, then forums aren't the best infrastructure. If you on the other hand want to encourage a more dynamic discussion following the initial topic that occasionally propels productivity/creativity and/or disseminates less self-articulated knowledge, it is. <br /><br />Another difference is that S.O. works because it has a really big user base. With the handful of regulars here, i'm just glad for what discussion there is. Had there been hundreds of active users, filtering measures had been more important. <br /><br />Or would a <em>Page Overflow</em> fly?

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />There are times when it's been an annoyance, and usually at those times someone might suggest/request starting a new thread (or just start that new thread themself) to redirect.<br /><br />That particular thread, though, I don't see the problem? The only people who commented on its slightly meandering nature seemed to be doing so in jest. I did not get the sense that it was interrupting or interfering with the OP's attempt to ask a question, and the topic stayed mostly relevant to the spirit of that question anyway.<br /><br />In most cases I think this freedom is very good. It allows people to express ideas in response to the topic at hand that they wouldn't have thought or wanted to start a thread for, and we very often good ideas and good discussions come out of this. Occasionally it is actually annoying, or detrimental to the cause of why the thread has started, and for those cases we can call for it to get back on track. I don't recall any time here where anyone's fought against a request to &quot;take it to its own thread&quot;.<br /><br /><br />As far as Stack Overflow goes, I actually strongly dislike that site, and it is not at all a model for how to have healthy discussions anyway. It's trying to be a question and answer reference. We have the Wiki for reference, and as far as questions go we have a lively group of people who actually answer them personally. (There have been multiple <a href="https://forums.nesdev.com/viewtopic.php?f=5&amp;t=16617" class="postlink">past discussions about Stack Overflow vs NESdev</a>, incidentally.) Unlike that site we don't have a culture here of being rude to people who ask familiar questions.

Also, it's harder to sort threads into very specific topics on a forum such as this, as opposed to more general video game forums, where you might have individual threads for each individual game, etc. Things are much more interconnected in the world of video game hardware and development.

As long as the question is answered and people want to post, I don't mind too much. Of course, if the main question is never answered and it's completely derailed then and only then it is not polite to the one that asked the question.

If it's not beneficial for the thread the OP will usually request a thread split anyway.

Hopefully, you can then make a SQLite virtual table that can be used to search (although the SQLite virtual table mechanism does have some limitations that makes some things less efficient than they should be).

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />It's not rude to link to past conversations about the same question, that's perfectly polite. Though on this place it's often the case that past threads are discussions and not succinct and palatable answers to the question (e.g. linking tepples' open-bus thread wasn't going to be of any direct help to oralisadog, even though it was technically a relevant answer to the question, and worth sharing for the discussion). Stack Overflow is very different in this respect, though I've seen overzealously links there too.<br /><br />Stack Overflow is full of useless and rude responses of &quot;you didn't ask this question in the arbitrarily right way/place&quot;, &quot;this was answered, and i'm not going to help you&quot;, &quot;use the search feature before asking a question like this&quot;, &quot;this has been answered, here's a link you could have found by searching (to something that answers a different question)&quot; etc. and maybe this stuff eventually gets cleaned up a little bit in editing, but I run into things like this every time I've ended up at SO through a google search. (I've never asked a question there, though.)
