		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Hello,
<br />I'm thinking about purchasing one of these Game Doctor floppy disc copying devices, mainly for playing translated SNES roms, and as a collectors item.
<br />There are 3 available, which are Game Doctor 3,6,7 and one more called UFO Super Drive Pro 7.
<br />They all seem to be 32Mb and load from floppy discs.
<br />I'm thinking the Game Doctor 7 is the best out of these, but I'm really trying to research this before I spend my money (they are around 100 with shipping). There seems to be quite a lack of good information out there on these devices, and the one document I have been looking for never seems to exist (the links for the txt file are always error 404).
<br />If anyone have information on these that would be useful, please let me know. Thank you <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />

<br />Not sure if I'd want one just to use with a Game Doctor (I have an SF7, but I lucked out and got a CD-ROM interface with it), but I do have other floppy-equipped stuff that could benefit as well, like an Atari ST.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Thanks for all the information guys <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />
<br />I'm running Windows 7 64-bit which ucon64 and SNESTool do not like. I'm guessing I'm going to be using another computer that's 32-bit so I could use these tools right?
<br />Also the flash carts seem to have the same amount of limitations, and I'm really wishing to play Star Ocean Translated (which I have seen many posts about), and I know that the GD7 does work with it.
<br />Yeah the whole thing was around 70 USD and 24.xx USD and came out to about 100 CAD (since I'm Canadian), and since I don't seem to know too much about the value of these things, I figured that was a good price since I've seen these things go for a bit in the past.
<br />Anyways thanks for all the information and quick responses <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />

<br />Yes, if you fit it with 96M of RAM. Assuming the SF7 you're considering has a single 32M card you'll need another 64M card will cost ~US$40. For that much you could purchase a PowerPak which will also play translated Star Ocean, and load the game from a CF card in a few seconds instead of minutes off of floppies or have to tether to a legacy computer.
