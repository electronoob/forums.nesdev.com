Saved to zero page and restored, I assume.

The sprite sheet converter read this file and turned it into a list of 8x16 pixel sprite tiles for each cel, arranged in horizontal strips. Optimizing the slabs was manual but not too difficult or time-consuming. In addition, each cel on of a sprite sheet could have other values and coordinates associated with it, such as the duration of each frame, the position and strength of hitboxes that a sprite deals during each frame, and how it interacts with physics.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=9">tepples</a> — Sat Apr 29, 2017 1:47 pm</p><hr />
