It only takes a few sentences to explain what exactly a variable does, or what a loop is. The tutorials should be easy to read, nice to look at, entertaining, informative, and newbie friendly.
<br />
<br />Haha, it's funny that you mention the command prompt. Back when I started, I didn't know crap about anything. So I didn't know how to really use command line programs. That actually took me a while to figure out. I think just to avoid confusion, the tutorials should guide people through all of the steps. At least it should start out that way, and as the tutorials progress, it should be assumed that the reader learned some of the basic procedures that were previously explained.

<br />maybe someone could write tutorials for the sticky that blargg can point to in the introduction of his his tutorials.
<br />
<br />if i can remember how the hell i did it, i can write a tutorial for adding nesasm to the PATH variable in windows and how to assemble a ROM with it, with pictures etc.

<br />Any forum is the bottom of the barrel when it comes to value for effort put in. I haven't been to other forums, but I <em>know</em> inside that the way things are done here is pretty pathetic compared to what can be done. Anyone with imagination can picture much less wasteful and organized approaches than what goes on here. I'm not blaming anyone (I sure haven't changed things), just am not blind to the sad reality. The only mention I'll make of any forum is for discussion. I'd never link to a sticky from a tutorial.

<br />i just came from the emergency room. my lady was sick we were there for at least 4 or 5 hours.
<br />
<br />i was modifying the sound ROM code from the noobie section. for one reason or another, i wanted to create a variable(which i worked around anyway, i just put the code inside of a label) and i couldn't find crap on my laptop. and i have tons of NES docs. in this time i browsed through many docs, searched them, and even did a windows document search with no luck at all.
<br />
<br />even if this tutorial is to be used offline, maybe an offline archive of the wiki would be good too(after broken links are fixed XD ).
<br />
<br />my 2 cents as always.
<br />LUV YA!!

<br />personaly i don't think you have to go as far as defining a computer or even giving tutorials on hex and binary.
<br />
<br />even though i too struggle with them, i think it's something people should pick up some docs learn about it, and if need be, get help from the community.
<br />
<br />now when it comes to setting up an assembler and environment variables for a nes related assmebler, or suggesting things to practice and giving examples, then it starts to make sense. i really don't think NESWiki should be wasting space teaching people what a computer is. but just my opinion.
<br />
<br />-edit-
<br />well at least it links to another page....didn't notice that.

<br />
<br />I didn't know what a bit or byte really WAS when I came here. I'd heard of them many times, but I didn't really know what defined them. And many people don't know the exact definition of a computer. Many people just think of a PC when they hear the term, but they don't really think about the fact that the NES is a computer. People that come here really may be people like I was who know absolutely nothing. Perhaps a huge long explanation of simple things isn't necessary, but I do feel quick explanations/reminders are necessary. For example, in a tutorial where someone is learning how to make simple games, and the tutorial is now guiding them through the assembling process, it's good to put in something like:
<br />
<br />"Now keep in mind that the assembler is translating our code into 1s and 0s for the NES to read."
<br />
<br />Just to keep the person learning completely aware of what's going on, even if they might know that already. I don't know, that's just what I think.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I started learning this like a week ago, and I have some knowledge of programming in other languages (all of which are object oriented), and don't find the overall structure of NES programs confusing - quite the opposite. NES programs seem really straightforward and there is actually a lot less to understand somehow. The biggest bumps so far have been the use of hexadecimals (which is really cool, once you understand it) and trying to figure out the 3-letter commands, what they do and what the various addresses are. The problem isn't that the programs are complicated but that the code doesn't give the slightest hint about what it does since you use extreme abbreviations and numbers rather than letters in most cases. Today I read up on the PPU in the wiki and a lot of things that were total fog before became pretty clear.
<br />
<br />I think one of the dangers here is giving the newb too much information at once. Reading about the PPU addresses and what they do isn't a good start. The tutorials should both cover as much of the absolutely necessary info as possible while leaving out as much unnecessary info as possible, since it will only confuse the reader. For the very first tutorials, every single line probably needs an explanation for everyone to understand. You need to explain the notation for those who are not used to it. For example:
<br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">.segment "HEADER"<br />	.byte "NES",26,2,1</div>
<br />These lines have no comments, no explanation about what they do, what the dots before "segment" and "byte" mean or what the numbers are, or what they are for. Agreed, telling would perhaps be too much info, which I just said was a bad thing, but for those who want to know right away, where should they look? This particular piece of code was explained a bit more in the first tutorial, but not in a way that a newbie would understand. There are several sections in the first tutorial listed as "not used here" but no explanation as to why they're even in the code if they're not used.
<br />This is why I think a wiki page for each tutorial would be nice - the reader could get more and more detailed explanations for each of the lines in the code, and click any word they don't understand ("dude... what's a "CHR Rom"?").
<br />
<br />It's kinda funny how technology this old needs to be reverse-researched like this. I mean, there are probably 50 or so people worldwide who know how to do this really well, but they're not around to be asked about it... I'm very grateful that the people who have managed to find out all this info on their own are willing to share it like this.
