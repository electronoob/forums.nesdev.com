		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Hi,<br /><br />I stumbled upon this thread trying to make this game. I've created the rom from your fix and burnt it and put it in an UNROM board but it doesn't work. I'm guessing this is due to the CHR-RAM? But all UNROM boards have this so is it okay to just take that chip out and put in the CHR data from the ROM? Or will rewiring be required?<br /><br />Thanks,<br /><br />- Hubz

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />What kind of &quot;doesn't work&quot; ? Even before you've replaced the CHRRAM with a CHRROM it should display a smear of colors (not unlike what you'll see running it in Nintendulator), just not the actual content.<br /><br />The pinout of the 8KiB RAM used should be compatible with that of an 8 KiB 'PROM. If you're using an EEPROM, you might want to tie its /WRite input high, but flash or UVEPROMs shouldn't need any help.

I didn't think it would need rewiring since it is a 28 pin EEPROM but maybe I am wrong. I went ahead and took out the CHRRAM and added the CHR ROM but no difference unfortunately.<br /><br />Thanks for any advice you can provide,<br /><br />- Hubz

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Do you get the klaxon from the opening animation when it first starts? If not, something is going wrong much earlier than the CHR should matter.<br /><br />I dug around for a bit, and just discovered a &quot;funny&quot; bug where if, for some reason, the game boots with the movable bank bank as the final bank it'll crash... On the unlikely chance that's what's wrong, you could add a couple of resistor+LEDs to the outputs of the 74'161. Or just test it with a voltmeter. But ... that's pretty unlikely; the game itself never writes 3 to the register, and the latch really should power up with the value 0 in it.<br /><br /><a href="http://wiki.nesdev.com/w/index.php/74161" class="postlink">Pinout of the 74'161</a>. Check the pins labeled Q0 and Q1 (13 and 14); if both are high that's what's wrong. If so, it can be fixed by lifting the /CLEAR pin (1) on the 74'161 and adding a resistor and capacitor. If that is what's wrong, the Correct Fix involves finding some free space in the final 16kB of the game... which in turn involves either DvD having their notes on where there's any, or someone else sitting down and play testing giving me a complete CDL.<br /><br />If that's not what's wrong, I don't have any better guesses than rewiring problems... You did rewire pin 22 to be ground instead of A16? Should have been the only thing you had to do.

If it's easy, try testing with <a href="http://nocash.emubase.de/magicflr.htm" class="postlink">Magic Floor</a> or Galaxian or something else tiny and reasonably guaranteed to work.
