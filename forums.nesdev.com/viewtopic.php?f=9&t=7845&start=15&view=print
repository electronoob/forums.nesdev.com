<br />
<br />I don't understand what you're asking about the cartridge open clone...
<br />
<br />As far as dumping goes without the copyNES goes, yes you can.  It's not the only way to get data off the ROMs.  There are other devices out there like the one I showed.  The kazoo allows you to dump with out any hardware besides the components shown and a PC.
<br />
<br />I'm really confused with what you're trying to do here.  And the red text isn't helping unfortunately...
<br />
<br />You want to dump carts to then play them on an original famicom?
<br />
<br />I don't see the point of dumping carts to play everything on the original equipment...

<br />no i want to dump them so that i can play them on the emulator (PC)

<br />
<br />Since it isn't a job for a newbie,  send it to someone who's done it before.  (no, not me)  It most likely is one of two things:  either a glop top single chip ROM+mapper dealie directly on the PCB with the NOAC,  or it's a separate carrier board soldered to i.e. the bottom pins of the cart connector with a single chip ROM+mapper glop top on it.
<br />
<br />The former case is hard to dump but can be done.  Normally you'd hold the NOAC in reset so it tristates the busses, then dump the ROM that way (though, dumping CHR ROM can be difficult and it may require destruction of the NOAC or the traces to same).
<br />
<br />The latter case is a bit easier;  you have to desolder the carrier board and solder it onto a cartridge or something that can be plugged into a copynes / copyfami.
<br />
<br />You can virtually guarantee that everything inside those units is going to be made as cheaply as possible, which means it will have glop tops and small PCBs.  Also, these days, the pirate fami carts are generally down to just a single chip.  They will have an MMC3+extensions and the ROMs built all into a single chip.  Some of the older single chip carts were simpler and just had 128K of PRG and 32K of CHR, but some of the later ones have 256K of PRG and 256K of CHR.  I assume these days that they can come with even more ROM than that.    In any event, it's impossible to dump the ROMs on these types of cartridges any other way than by probing it with a copyNES or similar hardware.  And be aware that it's almost guaranteed to have a new kind of mapper that is not emulated or reverse engineered yet.  Most likely it will have an MMC3 + extensions.

<br />the carts i wanna dump are old.they're since 1999 till 2003 and the console since 1996.so will they be easy for dumping?
