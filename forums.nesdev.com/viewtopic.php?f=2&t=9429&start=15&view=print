		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Some annoying flaws in otherwise good games and games that did it all right:<br /><br />Wario Land 3 - The controls are fun, the level layouts are interesting, but the format of giving each level four objectives that have to be completed in order, and having to unlock the most basic moves (Wario can't even swim at the beginning of the game!) makes me wish they rethought the overall progression scheme.  Also, the mini-game is not optional and takes more practice to beat than you'll probably like.  <strong>What got it right:</strong>  Wario Land 2 didn't try so hard to expand the basic concept.  You just tear through the scenery and collect stuff.<br /><br />Mario 64 - Going for that 100-coin star in Rainbow Land?  15 minutes of work down the drain when you make one miscalculated jump or get knocked around by an enemy.  <strong>What got it right:</strong>  Mario Galaxy was a ten-fold improvement on Mario 64 with the spherical platforming and using black holes to indicate fatal dropoffs.<br /><br />Skyward Sword, Megaman X5 - What do these two seemingly unrelated games have in common?  Unskippable tutorial sections.  <strong>What got it right:</strong>  <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8FpigqfcvlM">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8FpigqfcvlM</a><!-- m --> <br /><br />Ocarina of Time, Oracle of Ages - One game overabused the light world/dark world mechanic of LTTP, the other made so little use it was almost nonexistent.  Once Link became an adult, there was no real reason for anymore gameplay with him as a kid except for a forced handicap dungeon.  Ages had a boatload of moving between the past and future areas just to navigate some terrain.  Seasons could be a bit cumbersome but it was more involving.  (Did anyone expect to read about Water Temples and fish belly dungeons here?)  <strong>What got it right:</strong>  It would take an essay to explain how LTTP gels into perfection.  Minish Cap recaptures some of the greatness with more open exploration.<br /><br />Dragon Fighter, Holy Diver - Two NES games with some pretty fun platforming mechanics almost ruined by the endless barrage of enemies.  A short sword (Zelda II flaw again) or limited ammo is your downfall.  <strong>What got it right:</strong>  Contra puts you at fault for not dodging a deadly obstacle since you always have the range to shoot it and ample warning to jump around it.<br /><br />Bubble Bobble - It was excusable in the first game, but after Parasol Stars, the Bobble sequels should have equipped the dragons with a short-range attack.  It is not easy to avoid enemies in these games, but since they're arcade games that's the point, obviously.  <strong>What got it right:</strong>  Parasol Stars is hands down the best Bobble game because you get a short-range attack and can still use bubbles by grabbing them with the umbrella.

Castlevania built the game around it. The trick is not so much to not do it, but to make your game work around it.<br /><br />Kinda like how people complain Banjo Kazooie is a collect-a-thon, but the game is built around it...why is that a bad thing?</div><br /><br />Collect-a-thon is a subgenre. Having no control after you leave the ground isn't a subgenre, it's a a game mechanics decision. A very frustrating one. Sure, you can get used to it, you can even learn to be really good at a game with those mechanics. That doesn't mean it's a good decision.<br /><br />Castlevania was a decent game for it's time, but it hasn't held up very well. By modern standards it's a terribly designed and implemented game, but with pretty good music and presentation.<br /><br />Here's a fun exercise: compare CV1 to any of the GBA CV games. Then ask yourself which one controls better. The <em>only</em> difference between the two are controllable jumps. They all prevent the player from moving while attacking, they both have knock-back, they both have controllable jump height, similar inertia handling, etc.<br /><br />Also, I happen to like the sword length in Zelda II. Maybe I've just got rose-colored glasses for that game the way a lot of people have for CV1 <img src="./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /><br /><br />So here's my sin contribution: Having enemies that you can't hit because they are lower than your attack. This could be because you can't duck, or because even while ducking the enemy is still too low.<br /><br />Examples:<br /><br />Battle of Olympus and Faxanadu: Can't duck, and some of the earliest enemies you can't hit, or have to have extremely good timing to hit them when they jump.<br />Zelda II: Those little spikey things on the ground. You can hit them with the down thrust, so it's not so annoying, but still.</div><br /><br />I actually beat castlevania quite &quot;recently&quot; (a year ago?) I felt it actually held up pretty damn well.<br />I should mention I never grew up with that game, or nes for that matter. (I had a snes as a kid, since i'm pretty young compared to alot of folks here)<br />At risk of being &quot;that guy&quot; heres a video on castlevania compared to cv4 <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ww_PjqYQi5E">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ww_PjqYQi5E</a><!-- m --><br /><br />edit: whilst your at it, watch the one on cv1 and cv2 as well <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aip2aIt0ROM&amp;feature=relmfu">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aip2aIt0 ... ure=relmfu</a><!-- m -->

There's some that get it just right and it's just enough to only make you stay in an area a little bit longer, those are always good. But agreed on stuff being lower than your lowest shot, that's a terrible design for sure.

They usually fire a projectile at you immediately, making it almost impossible to prepare or react. The snow level is infuriating because of this.<br /><br />The SMB games are good examples of how to do this, where the enemies spawn offscreen to the right, so you can see them immediately when the screen scrolls over their position.

This could be done automatically.<br />* Logic breaking passable walls - especially if required for further progress.<br />* Segmented inventory.  The Big Chocobo as a secondary storage should have  just been part of main storage.<br />* Unexplained instant death zones on world map.  There's a path between statues on the world map that is instant (and without warning) death.
