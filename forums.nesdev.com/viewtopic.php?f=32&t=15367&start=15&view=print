Nipples, also No.<br /><br />A strange nude creature with no genitals and no nipples, might be Ok. Better if non-human...like an alien or anthropomorphic animal.<br /><br />Edit, 'Art' sometimes is given a pass...see Michelangelo's David...however, Stephen Colbert noted....<br /><br />&quot;For Michelangelo's statue of David, Colbert can only show &quot;a distant picture of the David for a total of two seconds.&quot;&quot;

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Thanks for the input. Besides, very interesting lecture, WheelInventor. Clears up a few points.<br /><br />Of course, everything is in the eye of the beholder. But I'm not the one making the rules, so as noted, <strong>if it is required that I add some pixels to somehow remove the perception that the character is nude for this game to be included in the multicart, please tell me</strong>. It's just a matter of spending a few extra minutes in a few edits so, really, no problem.<br /><br />If so, maybe it would be better to change the rules in future events so they explicitly forbid human nudity <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /> Maybe it's the language or cultural barrier, because, to my initial (and obviously wrong) understanding, the rule was about games with a sexual subject matter, and had nothing to do with nudity.

That's great stuff! <br /><br />Should future compo multicarts have a parental lock setting (preferrably stored in non-volatile memory)? That could enable contributors to do content that isn't &quot;E for everyone&quot; and still get it included without altering their original concept.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Thanks for the comments.<br /><br />@Rainwarrior - I have to polish the map a bit. I'm sure I let the player slip into an obstacle during the transition due to tile misplacement. Easily fixable, but I didn't have much time to check, sorry. If we are allowed to resubmit the game with fixes for the multicart, I'll try to find and fix the inconsistences.<br /><br />About the object, you have to find a temple in which you can use it. That will open one of the gates. press SELECT to bring a map. Temples are near the corners. Hint - the concept is based upon the good ol' Jan-ken-pon game.<br /><br />The extra pixels are for the multicart. We will release the game in ROM format in our site at a later time and you will be able to choose which version you prefer. <br /><br />@FrankenGraphics - that was exactly the feel we wanted to achieve, so I'm *very* glad you noticed.

I couldn't interpret the minimap, couldn't find out how to gain powers, use items, teleport, heal, or kill enemies. At one point I found a rock, but pressing B still did nothing.<br /><br />So, with only being able to jump, I died around some bats that couldn't be avoided.<br /><br />I liked the art, but the discoverability was terrible. It would have needed a tutorial level and better level design. Also the minimap should have used a contrasting color for &quot;you are here&quot;.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Yeah, I knew that this game wouldn't be very popular for some players as you are required to read the instructions to play.  I made sure that your progress leads you to the first charging pedestal, and you are also required to fly to exit the temple, so you can't really begin your quest without having to recharge and activate your powers. <br /><br />But even that way, you have to know beforehand that you have to interact with stuff pressing B (i.e. the pedestal to recharge) and that super powers need to be activated with B+UP. So I guess you are right. Could the introductory text be made more enlighting?<br /><br />Thank you.
