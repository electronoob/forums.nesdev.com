<br />I use CHR-RAM, but starting out with 4kB.

Then any ROM size will work and you can change and edit any nametable without loading any new files. It's up to you to add it, but I think that would be a great addition! <img src="./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /> I could definitely use it then. And you can bet your life I would. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" />   <img src="./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" />

<br />Put a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slider_%28computing%29" class="postlink">slider widget</a> next to the pattern table to select a 4 KiB bank, and I don't see how it would confuse. As the user moves the slider, the user sees that all the tiles in the nametable view change at once.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />The problem with this whole CHR thing is that  everything that has been said so far still doesn't work for all cases. Mappers like the MMC3 can make each 1KB chunk come from anywhere in a 256KB CHR file. You could even use the slider approach, but you'd need 4 sliders.
<br />
<br />CHR-RAM would be tricky to handle (unless you are making very basic use of it), so it might be a good idea to just expect the user to make a 4KB file with the combination of tiles he intends to use for that screen, instead of loading the actual CHR data that is included in the ROM (which could even be compressed).

<br />
<br />
<br />I had thoughts of how to support non-4K *.chr files. As I understand, we have just four common cases: 1K, 2K, 4K, 8K.
<br />
<br />For 8K we can have two banks, only one visible at a time, and two buttons select which part is visible. BMP import would only fill up current part of the 8K. There should be functions to save 8K or current 4K, probably just filter items in the save dialog, or maybe Nametable menu items.
<br />
<br />For 1K and 2K, I think it could be loaded starting from the currently selected tile in current 4K part (with any offset), and with ability to save 1K or 2K file starting from the cursor.
<br />
<br />Is that would be enough?

<br />If you're looking for other little feature to add <img src="./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" />
<br />
<br />In CHR editor:
<br />
<br />+ shift CHR up/down/left/right
<br />+ flip CHR horizontally/vertically
<br />+ colour fill tool
<br />
<br />No pressure though, they would just be the icing on the cake.

<br />The NES uses 8 KiB, but only 4 KiB at a time. The PPU has built-in bankswitching ($2000.D4). Mappers use more than that, again 4 KiB at a time. In my opinion, at a minimum, a nametable editor should support 4 KiB banks, which will cover CNROM, GNROM, Color Dreams, and S*ROM CHR banking. In fact, I just realized that I need to improve my Python-based nametable editor to support this (and sub-4 KiB files).

<br />Please be careful, these changes were relatively major, so maybe some bugs were introduced. I.e. backup your files before overwrite them with tool, just in case.
