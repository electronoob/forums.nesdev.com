I'm going to create a separate thread in the hardware forum to discuss details on developing a mapper to do this since I think it would be very powerful and useful.

<br />Original post in italics.
<br /><em>I didnt want to pollute the smurfs thread with my question so here it is, although my motivations are the same (to provide decent animations).<br /><br />Are there any mappers that allow the CHR data to be bank switched<br />(4K chunks preferred) from PRG RAM?<br /><br />I've looked at Videomation (CPROM) and I dont think it would do what I want.  You can swap CHR banks from RAM, but you would not be able to write to that RAM unless it was switched in.<br /><br />What I want to do is write to RAM that is not being used by the PPU, and then switch it in during VBlank, and then start writing to another unused block of RAM.  This way I can update the equivalent of the next frame during the frame, and not just during VBLANK.  That is why I figured it needs to be able to use PRG RAM.<br /><br />Al</em>

<br />SGROM (and similar boards) and TGROM (and similar boards) allows the CHRRRAM to be bankswitched among 4KB and 1KB chunks repsectively, but the total size of RAM available is still 8KB so this feature is pretty much worthles.

<br />
<br />I think this would be an interesting mapper and not terribly hard to implement in the PowerPak (using WRAM as additional CHR RAM), but it probably won't be easy to get implemented in emulators. 
<br />
<br />Since VRAM can be made accessible to the CPU using this same method, it could be pretty powerful mapper with clever programming. The only issue is keeping both RAM's in sync for normal style games which is costly in CPU time.
<br />
<br />This could partially be solved though if the mapper has a setting to write to both RAMs at the same time (would need to be during Vblank)

<br />w $8000-FFFF - mapper write
<br />
<br />D4-0 = select 16k bank at $8000-BFFF ($C000-FFFF fixed to last)

<br />D6 = CRAM0/1 mapped to $6000-7FFF (the other RAM is selected by the PPU)

<br />During frame render:  write the next CHR update to PRG RAM bank 2($C000-$DFFF)
<br />

<br />
<br />I realize I would not be able to bank switch at a small granularity (I am stuck with 8K chunks) but I would still be able to accomplish the end goal which is to do massive animations without having to turn off the display.
<br />
<br />That is assuming I can update up to 8K of PRG RAM in 1/60 of a second
<br />
<br />EDIT-  Ooops.   I dont know what I am saying.  $A000-$DFFF isnt PRG RAM.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />You guys are completely confusing CHRRAM with SRAM, wich are two completely different things. SOROM allows SRAM to be bankswitched, while CPROM allows CHRRAM to be bankswitched. No mapper will ever allow CHRRAM to be written to outside of VBlank, until you have a dual port SRAM. This will most likely never be possible with the power pack either.

All it takes is an address bus multiplexer and bi-directional tri-states or multiplexers on the data lines + control logic. Since WRAM is entirely connected to the FPGA in PowerPak, it is possible to use it for any general purpose storage.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />The key thing is that you need a address and data bus from the CPU to the inactive CHR RAM, and an <em>entirely separate</em> address and data bus from the PPU to the active CHR RAM. Further, once you switch which is the active one, you need the same buses to opposite chips. This requires a lot of logic to disconnect and reconnect each bus appropriately, or a dual-ported RAM. No simple modification to an existing mapper board will do this.
<br />
<br />kyuusaku: So the PowerPak has two SRAM chips, one usually used for CHR RAM/ROM and the other for WRAM? That'd be nifty for implementing this.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />It is NOT possible to disconnect the PRG or WRAM chips in the PowerPak from the CPU bus, nor is it possible to disconnect the CHR RAM from the PPU bus.  This is because the PRG and WRAM chips get address lines A0-A12 directly from the CPU (only A13-A18 come from the FPGA), while the CHR gets A3-A9 from the PPU directly (with A0-A2 and A10-A18 coming from the FPGA).  The only resource in the PowerPak that can be shared between the CPU and PPU is the internal 2K of RAM (called "FRAM" if I recall correctly).  This was done in anticipation of the MMC5's EXRAM.

<br />
<br />It can be made with a main register, ~10x 74157, 4x 74245 and a lot of glue or a CPLD with a lot of I/O. It could actually be made entirely out of 74245 (~14) and glue too instead of the multiplexers.
