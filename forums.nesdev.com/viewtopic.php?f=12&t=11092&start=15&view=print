Kind of a shame there's not more in the way of cheap, no-latency line doublers. (you can do it, but that stuff gets so expensive ... culminating in the $500 XRGB Mini.)</div><br /><br />I have to be honest...it is worth every penny. I bought one last year for hooking up all my retro systems to my 110&quot; projector setup, and the picture is sharp and beautiful. No latency, no issues. The only time it sucks is with games that constantly switch between 240p and 480i signals, as it takes about 5 seconds for the XRGB mini to switch.<br /><br />All this work on the SNES systems, buying extra circuits and such (not to mention drilling holes in the back) seems like a little too much work, when for $400 you can buy a device that properly handles ALL your retro systems...and you can even add scanlines <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />

I meant games in general, pretty much anything PSX and later.<br /><br />Another couple of titles are Chrono Cross on PSX which is 240p in game and 480i in menus, and Killer Instinct Gold on N64 that is 240p during fights, but 480i everwhere else.

I would buy one if I hadn't already found the Retron 5.  The device is very over priced and sometimes the most expensive solution is not the &quot;best&quot;.  With this device you still have to get the RGB connection from your console to achieve &quot;enthusiast&quot; results  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_lol.gif" alt=":lol:" title="Laughing" /> and I am sure that there are cables.<br /><br />I just thought I would put my electronics knowledge to use and learn something new and maybe get something out to the masses where they don't have to pay top dollar.  The little circuit that I built only cost me &lt; $10, now it isn't perfect and requires some tweaking but I get what I am looking for.

I'm pretty sure you're trying to say that time is proportional to money, and I'll agree with that. But the proportionality constant depends on several things.<br /><ul><li>One is the exchange rate between your country's currency and the dollar and euro. The buying power of a country's currency tends to run <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balassa%E2%80%93Samuelson_effect" class="postlink">lower in countries without an established export sector</a>. </li><li>Another is the employment situation in your area. If all you can find is a job for which you're drastically overqualified, time is worth less money. </li><li>Another is your country's import duties (hi tokumaru). </li><li>Another is the cost of working around other countries' sanctions on your government (hi Farid). </li></ul>

The previous topic was a wash and nothing got solved, people started attacking each other which just ruins any new people's perspective of accomplishing the project.<br /><br />What are your thoughts about the Retron 5 being that you have a projector just like myself?

Emulators tend to break with programs that rely on hardware edge cases that the emulator <a href="http://wiki.nesdev.com/w/index.php/Accuracy" class="postlink">handles incorrectly</a> and with newly discovered or invented mappers (NES) or coprocessors (Super NES). For example, an emulator created prior to a few years ago won't support the Action 53 mapper (#28) or the MSU-1 coprocessor. You rely on the hardware manufacturer for making games compatible. I'd love to see what it does with the PowerPak.<br /><br />But then I could be wrong; if so, please correct me.

I have had mine pre-ordered since last September, personal opinion is what I was looking for.  I hope they designed it to properly upscale the graphics so that the processor can handle the game play smoothly.<br /><br />Emulation dump, is perfectly fine for me just as long as it works as I have a sd2nes, Everdrive MD, Everdrive N8, Gameboy ED adapters and was hoping to rock those.  I am looking forward to the wireless Bluetooth controller because I do have a projector.

Given, the HDMI out <span style="text-decoration: underline">is</span> a nice feature, but I don't believe it will look as good in comparison to a dedicated upscaler/line doubler. Unless they have a really kick-ass system in there, but given the past Retron systems' manufacturing quality I kinda doubt it. I hope I'm wrong, as there is a lot of hype about it.<br /><br />I'm sure it will get the job done. At the very least it will look much better than composite or S-Video on most HD devices...and at $99 I guess you can't complain too much  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=":wink:" title="Wink" />

A device pretending to be a cartridge connected to a device (which most likely is able to read SD cards directly, even if this feature is hidden from the user) pretending to be a console... sounds like the most inefficient setup ever!

However, it would take a lot of my time and I do not have much experience with video signals nor the equipment (100MhZ+ Scopes and DSO) the reward might be worth the risk.<br /><br />Your thoughts?
