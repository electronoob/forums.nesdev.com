I don't know what's going on for sure, but what I've encountered while using an EPROM emulator was that sometimes just one or 2 sprites (I think always the same ones, too) would be corrupted.  What I believe is that the sprite DMA is changing the normal operation of the memory access cycle in a way that would only affect something fast (like 10ns response) such as a bus buffer.  Same thing as this other thread: <a href="http://nesdev.com/bbs/viewtopic.php?t=6212" class="postlink">http://nesdev.com/bbs/viewtopic.php?t=6212</a><br /><br />So, I don't know the problem, or the fix, but the work-around is to use series resistors on the data bus.  The NES PowerPak seemed to have ran into a similar issue.  I don't think resistors don't fix the problem, but rather they prevent a bus conflict from becoming the problem.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">2600 wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"><br />The 5v tolerant part doesn't bother me as much as the lack of pull-ups on the data bus. If pull-ups were allowed, this wouldn't even be an issue.<br /></div><br /><br />Do you mean the PRG data bus?  Why are pull-ups needed?  If it's 8 resistors or so to put on the board, that's not too bad (assuming the CPLD upgrade is worth it, I'm not familiar with the differences).<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=10">Memblers</a> — Tue Jun 29, 2010 4:53 pm</p><hr />

I haven't used either, but AFAICT any device that is 5V-tolerant should be just fine without any kind of external protection.  Actually, later I'm planning on trying a device that isn't 5V tolerant, but will use series resistors to make it so (as described in one of Xilinx's app notes), so wish me luck on that, heheh.<br /><br />Timing-wise you need to be careful with the PRG bus (because of odd sprite-DMA issues and maybe other stuff), but the same thing applies when using 74-series chips or anything else as well.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=10">Memblers</a> — Mon Jun 28, 2010 9:31 am</p><hr />

There has been a little bit of talk, but I've wondered if anyone has actually used a XC9500XL series before with the NES.   Any issues noticed?<br /><br />I've been planning to stick to the XC9500 series, but the XL is often tempting.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3385">2600</a> — Thu Jun 24, 2010 8:16 pm</p><hr />
