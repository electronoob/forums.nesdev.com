I read what was labeled as ASM tutorial and sure enough, that's exactly what it was. It mostly said how to do things like load and store values but never really said how you could use your newly acquired knowledge to make anything with it.

						<div class="postbody">why can't YOU use your newly acquired knowledge of the language to apply the general concepts you learned? Can you think for yourself? I'm not being rude.. but seriously... if you're sick of the basics, but if you actually know the basics, what's so hard about thinking about implementing it for yourself!!! You want a character to jump?? Have you already learned to draw a sprite to screen and DMA and do vblank??? you make it sound like you already know it. if thats true, shouldn't it be trivial for you to take it upon yourself to learn some basics applications of gravity on a y coordinate and update periodically for your character to jump?? OK rant over... <br /><br />but there's a really good tutorial on this stuff in C and SDL that u can take to the ASM field.. they used to be called 'jnrdev'.. taught u about running and jumping (jnr) and collision detection. good luck.</div>

						<div class="postbody"><div class="quotetitle">Espozo wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">Yes, mostly because I almost don't see why I have so much difficulty programing and it seems like everyone else doesn't. (I know I really sounded like a looser there.) It would be like If you took Spanish class and you made terrible grades and everyone else made hundreds all the time even if you did your best. Incase you haven't noticed, I'm a bit of a perfectionist. (I'm sure my OCD doesn't help.) What I think is one of my main flaws is that I like to get ahead of myself. I was originally thought about programing for the NES, but I didn't even do anything for it before I decided that I wanted to work with the SNES, which was the first system I ever programmed for. Heck, I just got into programing a little over four months ago. It seems like most of the people on this website are either in college or are college graduates while I just graduated middle school about a year a go. I should probably slow down a bit... The other thing that I think gets my frustrated is how the SNES was made. Don't get me wrong, It's a great system (my favorite, actually) but I feel like some of the design choices were a bit strange. (Not saying I could have done better, of course.) I do always hear people complain about the CPU speed and that leads to one question... Why didn't Nintendo overclock it? I'm no hardware expert, but I always thought you could keep increasing CPU speed until the CPU melted, which the SNES CPU is far from doing as the console doesn't even generate a half a degree of heat. Heck, isn't the SA-1 just a 65c816 running at 10 megahertz? If it is, that just shows it can be done.</div><br />So random tidbits here about me, since I think you see other people's success (maybe just here on the forum?) as a frustration point for you (i.e. &quot;they can do this so easily, why am I having such difficulty?):<br /><br />I've had this same feeling myself, though about all sorts of things in life, not just console stuff.  I started writing out several examples (ex. my successes and failures with learning foreign languages, esp. Asian languages, how I've never gone to university and didn't finish high school, and the difficulties of being an introvert), but realised I'd just make an even bigger monster post.  So here are some random tidbits that might give you inspiration just knowing:<br /><br />- Despite my history and age (I'll be 38 next month), I started with an Apple II+ (6502) doing machine language and later assembly.  My first home computer was an Apple IIGS (65816), which is where I did the bulk of my assembly programming.  The first video game console I worked on was the SNES; I did NES stuff 4-5 years later.  For what it's worth, I think the SNES is a significantly better console and much easier to program/work on than the NES (especially with regards to graphics -- NES PPU is still the #1 struggle point around here, with audio being #2).  I've avoided audio on both platforms because audio is something I just cannot wrap my brain around.<br /><br />- I never finished high school, and I never went to university/college.  Almost everything I know is self-taught.  The only PLs I learned in school were Applesoft BASIC and Pascal.  Assembly, C, Perl, shell scripting (not really a PL but still), and some super simple JavaScript I've learned on my own.  I have to deal with Ruby and it's crap (and let me tell you, it IS crap) as part of my day job, and there isn't a day that goes by that I don't curse because of how ridiculous of a PL it is.  Anyway, point is, I am one of the people who does not have a full education.<br /><br />- Right now (in the world), you're surrounded by people doing programming in high-level languages.  Being someone who is interested in assembly makes you the odd man out -- trust me, I know.  It doesn't help that a lot of these present-day languages are utter garbage (ex. Ruby, Go, Python, etc.) and have too much going on under the hood and too much &quot;middleware&quot; design (especially the OO ones) that waste cycles.  (It upsets me that we have 3GHz+ CPUs -- something I could have never dreamt of -- yet simple programs run like molasses because a lot of programmers today don't understand how their high-level PL code maps to assembly/behaves on the actual CPU).  The advantage you have over these people is that you will understand how the processor works.  I always bow to other assembly coders, because assembly is essentially KISS principle, and I support that (and live by it, in a lot of ways).<br /><br />- Yeah, I've noticed you question the hows and whys of the design of the SNES and consoles.  My general suggestion is: stop doing that (you aren't the only one whose done this BTW).  You can't change how they are.  You can still write code on them and make stuff (simple or complex) on them without knowing why, for example, the last 32 bytes of OAM are unused.  :-)  <br /><br />- As for 65816 CPU speed and why the CPU ran at what it did: plain and simple: cost.  This is where (humbly) it's hard to explain to people who weren't of age or around during the 80s and 90s.  The system I learned 65816 on, the Apple IIGS, ran at 2.8MHz with a 1MHz bus speed (which was needed to retain 100% compatibility with the earlier Apple II models).  There were cards made several years later which had faster crystals on them, allowing the CPU to run at up to 16MHz (but still with a 1MHz bus).  They were expensive -- US$400+ or so.  The SNES would have cost a crapload of money if Nintendo had chosen to use, say, a 12MHz crystal instead of 2.68MHz or 3.58MHz (FastROM).  The only systems that used that kind of thing that were game-related at the time were arcades, not home systems.  So that said, this is my opinion of people who complain about CPU speed on the SNES (or any classic console or system): stop whinging.  It's part of history and just how it is, you can't change console (okay sure you could, but you can't guarantee everyone is going to mod their SNES just to meet your needs).  The reason things were done that way then were often economically-driven.  You can't compare technology of today to things from 20-30 years ago; things today are mindblowingly advanced and fast.  My point here is this: it's best to just accept how things are and then sit back and say &quot;hmm, okay, so either I can't do the thing I want, or I have to come up with a way to do it differently, or make sacrifices&quot;.  That's how we thought back then too.<br /><br />Random other tidbit: I should note that after I stopped doing NES docs and made them public-domain, I stopped doing NES development (for the most part) altogether.  I had spent... god, I don't know... 12 years?  13 years?  Focusing on nothing but technical aspects of the consoles, how the games worked, etc..  One day I had an epiphany: I couldn't play a NES or SNES game without my brain starting to think about how it worked and why it worked that way.  It completely overwhelmed my ability to enjoy what it was I was playing.  I had become so fixated on the technological that it was taking away my enjoyment.  This might not apply to everyone, but it was what happened to me.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">Espozo wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">I tried the snes demo you made but it didn't work. I looked at vram, cgram, oam, and work ram and they were all blank. I looked at the source code, (not to hard) but from the looks of it, it doesn't look like something I wouldn't be able to make.</div><br />The reason it probably doesn't work is because the ROM wasn't padded to 512KBytes (4mbits), which is the minimum allowed ROM size for the SNES.  The development systems I (and most of us) had back in the early 90s were copiers like the Super Wild Card (usually costing US$450 and up), and we wrote our code on a PC or Amiga, assembled it using a 65816 assembler, then copied the ROM to a floppy, then stuck that in the copier and loaded it.  32KBytes takes a lot less time to copy than 512KB, especially when you know 480KB consists of nothing but filler ($00 or $FF).  The copier took care of the padding for you.  Yes, some copiers had parallel ports, but the software and LPT methodology was finicky (especially with ECP and EPP), but it still took several seconds to load the data that way (it was faster than using a floppy disk though).<br /><br />And yeah, the demo is very simple -- it's intended to show people how some basic registers work, and tinker with some &quot;fun&quot; things.  It isn't complex, and that's intentional.  For example, I've never spent any time with OBJ/OAM on the SNES (or the NES for that matter).  I &quot;get&quot; them, but I've never spent the time to actually do anything with them.  There's a lot of things on both the SNES and the NES I haven't tinkered with simply because I have trouble understanding some things (a great example is, I STILL do not fully understand/remember the nature of how the NES PPU behaves with $2000/$2005/$2006).  It's a matter of what personally interests me (then and now both).  For more complex examples, see the source for a lot of the Anthrox SNES demos -- those are crazy (some are so timing-sensitive every CPU cycle matters).<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">Espozo wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">And then your GBA said, &quot;Psst... you have 4 <strong>actually useful</strong> backgrounds here&quot;.</div><br />GBA wasn't a system that interested me.  It's CPU is intimidating (to me), and while I enjoyed a lot of games on my GBA, but handhelds haven't really ever interested me.  The NES and SNES are the two I like most, with a secret love of the PC Engine/TG16.  :-)<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">Espozo wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">Lastly, what the heck is this? I'm guessing C?<br />printf(&quot;$%04X&quot;, address)</div><br />Yes, it's C, but printf is available in a lot of languages (e.g. PHP, Ruby, etc.).  You can read about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Printf_format_string#1970s:_C.2C_Lisp" class="postlink">printf here</a> (ignore the Lisp example).  The code in question would output to the screen the literal string/text <tt style="margin-left: 2px; margin-right: 2px; padding:3px; background-color: #3355aa; color: white;">$XXXX</tt> where <tt style="margin-left: 2px; margin-right: 2px; padding:3px; background-color: #3355aa; color: white;">XXXX</tt> is a zero-padded capitalised hexadecimal number (whatever the variable &quot;address&quot; contains).  I.e. if <tt style="margin-left: 2px; margin-right: 2px; padding:3px; background-color: #3355aa; color: white;">address = 0xea</tt> then <tt style="margin-left: 2px; margin-right: 2px; padding:3px; background-color: #3355aa; color: white;">printf&#40;&quot;$%04X&quot;, address&#41;</tt> would output <tt style="margin-left: 2px; margin-right: 2px; padding:3px; background-color: #3355aa; color: white;">$00EA</tt>.<br /><br />If you want to see some C code I've written (I comment fairly heavily), just today I migrated <a href="https://github.com/koitsu/bsdhwmon" class="postlink">one of my public open-source projects</a> to github.<br /><br />Finally, a footnote: I want you to know it makes me <strong>EXTREMELY</strong> happy to see folks like you, psychopathicteen, tepples, and many others doing stuff on the SNES in this day and age.  It really honestly does.  It induces a deep sense of nostalgia in me and reminds me of the feelings I first had when doing SNES development.  I still remember the night I finally figured out the mode 0 graphics data/format -- after literally 5 or 6 hours of trial and error I finally got it.  I was at a friend's house, and it was something like 0300 in the morning.  I leapt out of my chair and started yelling &quot;IT WORKS!!! IT FUCKING WORKS!&quot; and was so proud of myself.  My friend woke up and looked at the text I had on the screen (white text on a black background) and said &quot;...now make it multiple colours&quot; and went back to bed (and within about an hour I did, then combined that with smooth background scrolling).<br /><br />I feel the same way about NES development too, it makes me so happy to see so many people doing games on the console, and I try very hard to contribute a couple hundred USD to every single Kickstarter project there is relating to the NES.  I'm still tremendously excited about LizardNES.</div>

						<div class="postbody"><div class="quotetitle">Espozo wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">The other thing that I think gets my frustrated is how the SNES was made. [...] I do always hear people complain about the CPU speed</div><br />If you're referring to &quot;Blast Processing&quot; and &quot;Genesis does what Nintendon't&quot;, consider that the 68000 can access memory only on one of every four CPU cycles. This makes a 7.67 MHz CPU in practice closer to 1.92 MHz memory-wise. The 65816 in the Super NES can access memory on every cycle, but there are fewer of them (3.58 MHz) and the data bus is narrower (8-bit instead of 16-bit), so it's kind of a wash. See <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/viewtopic.php?p=92238#p92238" class="postlink">gencycle</a> and nearby posts.<br /><br />Tip: Don't call the S-CPU &quot;slow&quot; around psycopathicteen unless you're interested in a sermon as to why this is not the case.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">and that leads to one question... Why didn't Nintendo overclock it?</div><br />I can't say with certainty why Nintendo <em>didn't</em> do something, but I can say why a reasonable company <em>wouldn't</em> under similar circumstances. And I see three reasons not to overclock the NES CPU.<br /><ol style="list-style-type: decimal"><li>First, 1.8 MHz was already faster than the 1.0 MHz of the Apple II and Commodore 64 and the 1.2 MHz of the Atari 2600. And it was competitive with the 3.6 MHz Z80 in the ColecoVision and SG-1000, as a Z80 typically gets as much work in 4 cycles as a 6502 gets in two. </li><li>Cost, as koitsu mentioned. A product with a faster specified frequency tends to be more expensive. Video game consoles introduced at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IH2w2l1JTs4" class="postlink">599 US Dollars</a> tend not to sell well, especially when the video game industry is pulling out of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_American_video_game_crash_of_1983" class="postlink">1983-1984 recession</a>. Look at the first year of the 3DO and PlayStation 3. </li><li>Nintendo was trying to build a reputation for building video game hardware that is <a href="https://allthetropes.orain.org/wiki/Tonka_Tough" class="postlink">Tonka Tough</a>, a reputation that would last throughout its cartridge years. (N64 Control Stick and DS shoulder buttons are exceptions.) Actual overclocking, or running a part at a frequency over its spec, would cause unreliability that threatens this reputation. </li></ol>All of these apply just as much to the Super NES CPU.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">I'm no hardware expert, but I always thought you could keep increasing CPU speed until the CPU melted</div><br />CPUs start giving wrong results before they start melting. Even if a particular clock speed works in the lab, it might not work in people's homes where the air is dirtier and the ambient temperature varies more. It's better to stick with the spec provided by Western Design Center (the designer of the 65816 core in the S-CPU) and Ricoh (the S-CPU manufacturer).<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">Heck, isn't the SA-1 just a 65c816 running at 10 megahertz? If it is, that just shows it can be done.</div><br />The SA-1 came out later, once it had become cheaper to make a fast 65816. Notice how no SA-1 games were released in 1990 when the Super Famicom shipped.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">most of the tutorials [at superfamicom.org] only show you how do things like load data to vram and scale a bg in mode 7 but don't even tell you how to do something like make a character jump.</div><br />Hardware tutorials are for hardware-specific issues, and jumping is not one of them. You need <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler_method" class="postlink">Euler integration</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fixed-point_arithmetic" class="postlink">fixed-point arithmetic</a> for that: add gravity and other accelerations to velocity each frame and then add velocity to position each frame. And they don't put jumping in every tutorial because not all games need jumping.</div>

						<div class="postbody"><div class="quotetitle">tepples wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">Espozo wrote:The other thing that I think gets my frustrated is how the SNES was made. [...] I do always hear people complain about the CPU speedIf you're referring to &quot;Blast Processing&quot; and &quot;Genesis does what Nintendon't&quot;, consider that the 68000 can access memory only on one of every four CPU cycles. This makes a 7.67 MHz CPU in practice closer to 1.92 MHz memory-wise. The 65816 in the Super NES can access memory on every cycle, but there are fewer of them (3.58 MHz) and the data bus is narrower (8-bit instead of 16-bit), so it's kind of a wash. See gencycle and nearby posts.</div><br /><br />I personally think that hardware wise, the Genesis is overrated. It boggles my mind as to how people think that a console released in 1988 would be better than a console released in 1990 for the exact same launch price. I mean, a 6 megahertz CPU isn't exactly &quot;screaming fast&quot; (compare it to most arcade machines that ran at about 12 megahertz and usually had a z80 or something thrown in). What everyone fails to mention is that the SNES has two large PPUs that are about as powerful as the main CPU so while the SNES's main CPU may be a little behind the Genesis's (the Genesis's CPU is definitely not &quot;almost twice as fast&quot; as I heard that the 68000 isn't the most efficient.) Sega fanboys always fail to mention that in order to &quot;truly&quot; know the SNES's power (don't quote me on this) you would need to multiply 3.5x3 and that would get you 10.5 vs. 6.<br /><br />I know I'm going to sound crazy for this but If I were to pick a main problem with the SNES, It wouldn't be the main CPU speed, but rather the two PPU's speed. I almost don't see why people complain so much about the CPU speed when you can 1. Optimize your code as much as possible. And If you still have slowdown than proceed to step 2. Add an expansion chip. You can always add more processing power for moving everything around, but It's not like you can add more BG layers or increase sprite overdraw. (After all, It's a video game console, not a calculator.  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=":wink:" title="Wink" /> ) Basically, what I am saying is that you can add on to the CPU, but not the PPU's. Just thinking, how can the SNES do transparency? If you were to average two colors across the screen, wouldn't you have to load a value from the main screen, add a value from the subscreen to it, do a bit shift operation on it two divide it by two and then store the result somewhere 57,344 (256x224) times? While cool, I imagine that if they would have cut out the transparency effects, there would have been more room for other things. (Like 3 4bpp bg layers.)<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">tepples wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">Tip: Don't call the S-CPU &quot;slow&quot; around psycopathicteen unless you're interested in a sermon as to why this is not the case.</div><br />Ha!  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /> I wonder, do you two know each other well?<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">tepples wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">Video game consoles introduced at 599 US Dollars tend not to sell well</div><br />I honestly thought you were referring to the Neo Geo  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" /> (Didn't that actually go for $700 though?)<br />Speaking of money, watch this.

(It's something so simple that even I figured it out by myself.  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt=":roll:" title="Rolling Eyes" /> )<br /><br />About increasing the CPU speed, At the time I wrote about making it faster, I was not aware of this &quot;crystal&quot; thing. I don't know why, but I always just assumed that you could just feed a CPU more power and it would run faster. (which really wouldn't cost any money.)<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">koitsu wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"> <div class="quotetitle">Espozo wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">And then your GBA said, &quot;Psst... you have 4 <strong>actually useful</strong> backgrounds here&quot;</div><br />GBA wasn't a system that interested me.  It's CPU is intimidating (to me), and while I enjoyed a lot of games on my GBA, but handhelds haven't really ever interested me.  The NES and SNES are the two I like most, with a secret love of the PC Engine/TG16.  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":-)" title="Smile" /> </div><br />Personally, I think I would have liked the GBA more if it were a home console, but at the day and age it was released, It never would have been. Also about the CPU, I don't possibly know how you wouldn't think it's fast. (That is, If you weren't born yesterday and have never heard CPU speed measured in anything but Gigahertz before.) Although It was made ten years after, the GBA makes just about all the arcade machines from back in the day look like scared puppies. The one problem I see with the GBA though is that although they made the processor blazing fast, they really didn't really do way too much with vram.<br /><br />Also, how many high level programing languages are there? 3,000? About 3Ghz CPU's and programs running very slow, although there really isn't any need for it and it would take just about an eternity to make, I'd love to see how fast computers would run if everything were still written in ASM.<br /><br />About leaning mode 0 at your friend's house at three hundred in the morning, how old were you? I assume there weren't any tutorials online? (Or online, for that mater.) Since you've kind of given me a background history of yourself, I am going to ask when and why did you drop out of highschool? What is your current Job?

Also, the GBA's low resolution really stands out on a large TV. (I'm sure they would have increased it if it were a home console.)<br /><br />Also, do you think you could go over the whole BG thing again? I kind of got lost while reading it... I always kind of wondered why say in mode 0 if you add up the &quot;bits per pixelage&quot; between all the layers, you would get 8bpp and in mode 1, you would get 10bpp and in mode 3, you would get 12bpp. I'm sure there is more than to just dividing bpp among layers. Based on this, It seems like you could say that with every new BG layer, you loose 2bpp. If I were to make a game, I would probably make it in mode 3, as I always felt that you get the most bang for your buck. (Of course, vram starts to be an issue then, so you really can't win.  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" alt=":(" title="Sad" /> )</div>

						<div class="postbody">yes maybe u understand the basic grasp now of how to implement jumping, but you should NAIL IT DOWN with a demo. The fixed point math reference tepples made is extremely important on these systems without floating support. It's a useful way to use the bytes/words as a cheap decimal fractional notation. Very important to learn I think.. Depending how good you are with the SNES u might want to postpone this and learn more satisfying things first, that's up to you. Plus if you make a demo that interacts with the player by jumping you will have gained real experience in making your ideas come to life..</div>
