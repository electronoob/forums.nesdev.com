<br />
<br />I use Eclipse at work and it works surprisingly well for C++.
<br />Netbeans (some other bloated Java-based IDE) also has C++ support and is better in my opinion.
<br />They'll both eat all your RAM, but if your computer runs Windows 7 I suppose it should be able to run bloated IDEs too <img src="./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" />

The only thing you don't have is MFC, ATL and the resource editor (and maybe some re-factoring option may have been removed but that may not be the case anymore with vs2010). But since your emulator is a console one, I don't see any issue here since you're not using any of theses.
<br />
<br />You could always try Eclipse but.. Good luck to figure out how to debug. For now I'm trying to use it under linux for editing code for an existing apache module where I work and would like to find any resources to debug inside eclipse <img src="./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" /> With VS, remote debugging was a charm with IIS7. Attach to process and voila.

<br />- The <a href="http://www.allegro.cc/forums/print-thread/594895" class="postlink">subsystem is windows</a>, not console. Just because it hasn't a Win32 API menu interface doesn't mean it's console, AFAIK...

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Since we seems picky on words here (I had to write that answer fast), I will rephrase what I said. You have an application that have a custom UI. This means it does compile under win32 but it doesn't use any of the windows UI capabilities. That why I said "console" in a way but yes it uses the windows subsystem. 
<br />
<br />Some of the limitation of VS C++ express are (for 2008, should be same for 2010):
<br />
<br />[Lack of MFC] 
<br />Non issue since your emulator uses a custom UI so for sure it won't use MFC
<br />
<br />[Lack of ATL]
<br />Non issue since you were using MinGW and ATL is MS specific template library so you will not touch that
<br />
<br />[Lack of a resource editor]
<br />You have a custom UI which mean you may not use resources files for menu/windows and things like that so it's a non issue. Worst case, there are free resources editors and you must be using one already for the win32 version if you have some anyway.
<br />
<br />To be multi-platform, you just make a project file for your win32 version which will give you access to the the VS debugger. You then make some make file for other platforms.  
<br />
<br />You OS is Win7.  I don't see why you should avoid their tools when you're using their latest OS in the first place. Try it. I'm sure you will not regret it. The debugger is worth it. And if you don't like it after, it was the free version after all: you didn't lose anything in the end except the time to try it.
<br />
<br />Of course there will be a little bit of fiddling at the beginning to create the project file since you may not know about it but once set, you don't need to change anything.

<br />
<br />That's got to be one of the biggest reasons I prefer dev-cpp over it. Plus, I tend to make my apps in SDL, or other cross-platform libraries, so a lot of MSVC++'s built-in functionality would be useless to me.
<br />
<br />Edit: I don't remember what my exact reason for not liking MSVC++ is, but I know the fact that it costs money is one of them.

<br />Provided you already have new enough hardware and OS, VC++ Express costs no more than whatever your ISP charges for a few hundred megabytes of download.
