Hi there... female NESdever chiming in. I've been lurking on the boards since the early 2000s, and got my account here in 2006 or so, but I don't post much. I think a few folks here know me or have collaborated with me in some way, though. <br /><br />I'm the only woman I know of who has released NES homebrew. (Though I'd love to meet more!) <br /><br />I think there are a number of factors that turn girls away from homebrew culture before they can get deeply invested in it. For example, when I was younger, forums felt especially unwelcoming to girls, so I mostly taught myself 6502 out of old programming books. <br /><br />My latest NES release was in September (<!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://partytimehexcellent.itch.io/electronic-sweet-n-fun-fortune-teller">http://partytimehexcellent.itch.io/elec ... une-teller</a><!-- m -->), and I'm working on a new NES game now. I've been hacking various Nintendo platforms since I was about 17 or so. (My most recent hack was putting one of my NES homebrews inside of Animal Crossing for Gamecube: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkDweI9U4Jg">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkDweI9U4Jg</a><!-- m -->).<br /><br />My area of interest is in representing femininity and girls' cultures through 8-bit games. So you'll see that most of my graphics and music tend toward the pink and cutesy side.<br /><br />Hope this helps the discussion!<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=795">Rachel</a> — Mon Feb 23, 2015 1:44 pm</p><hr />

In order to take a programming class at my school, you have to take a class in 9th grade that teaches you how to use Microsoft Office, which about half of the class <em>still</em> doesn't know how to do, and a lot of the people are sophomores too. I learned how to use Microsoft Word when I was 6 years old at my old school in Virginia. It was really cool, because if you had any remaining time when you got done with the lesson, you got to play on Kid Pix. Anyone remember that? Anyway, I bet I'm not even going to like the programming class when I get there, because it's sure as hell not going to teach you ASM. (And not on the 65816. <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=":wink:" title="Wink" /> ) it's probably going to be RubyPython+++++ or whatever bloated, inefficient garbage.

The intended meaning may be clear to users of the forum, but necessarily to those with an outside perspective.<br /><br />More on topic, I think positive exposure to both something specific like NES development and more broad like an appreciation for computing is something that must be done early on. It is good that some high schools are willing to introduce students to programming, but at least from my experience the result is that people hate it or want to make money with it as mentioned earlier in the thread. Finding someone willing to teach at that level who can be passionate about why they enjoy it is certainly a challenge.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=5314">mikejmoffitt</a> — Sun Feb 22, 2015 1:59 pm</p><hr />

This topic reminded me of a guy a few years ago that seemed determined to find a female member among the regular posters of NESDEV. He would randomly ask people whether they were girls based on their usernames or avatars, until he was told to stop doing this because there were no girls. I don't remember who that was and have no idea if he's still around. Does anyone else remember this?<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=95">tokumaru</a> — Fri Feb 20, 2015 10:43 am</p><hr />
