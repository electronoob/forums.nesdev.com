(You can play for free, you just can't make.) Some of them are pretty neat.<br /><br />The scope of these games is kept pretty small by the fixed &quot;cartridge&quot; size, which is actually a restriction on the source code size, I believe.

In contrast, if you run out of space in an NROM game, you have plenty of options available to you.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />The size limit is presumably to give all developers a level playing field comparable to the early NES era. Limiting the complexity allows projects with the <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/viewtopic.php?f=2&amp;t=5927" class="postlink">complexity of 1- or 2-person hobby projects</a> to have a chance of competing.<br /><br />This is opposed to the &quot;bigger is better&quot; mentality that pervaded part of the industry after cartridge games reached 2 Mbit. Meg-itis started with &quot;The 2 Mega Cartridge&quot; on Master System and then spread to Neo Geo.

Little experiments. I actually kind of like that part.<br /><br />What kills it for me is just the price. I have no shortage of &quot;restrained&quot; platforms to play with already. If I was feeling the itch I'd probably play with <a href="http://www.puzzlescript.net/" class="postlink">puzzlescript</a> or any number of other similar things.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Sure putting some limit makes sense, but their choice seems excessively low.  Graphically it's very comparable to the NES, but the size limit restricts one from creating a NES scale game.<br /><br />I realize they have their reasons, it just seems like a silly decision to me that has more significant down sides than benefits.  People make games within the constraints of NROM all the time and are perfectly happy.  I don't think the availability to step beyond 40KB deters people from developing on the NES, why would it deter people from the pico8?  People enjoy making games for the NES knowing full well they'll never compare to the grandure of their favorite NES titles.  The presence of bigger better titles on a console doesn't seem a significant deterrent on this level of console IMO.  It's not like the console is on par with N64 or later..<br /><br />I talked with someone who hand made a decent game/demo for the pico8, but they wanted to start working on a NES game because of the attraction to move beyond pico8 size limits.  It just seems like missed opportunity to me.<br /><br />A person looks at the console and thinks cool, it reminds me of the NES.  Maybe they had an idea to make a game when they were a kid, and this is a reasonably easy platform to learn game dev and maybe start making that game you've always wanted.  But no sorry, we only want tiny games for this virtual console.  Just seems counter productive to what appears to be the goal of the project to me.
