Ive been Calling the NES the NES (en ee es) since I was a small child in its active era, when the SNES came out I called it the Super NES but when the N64 came out I always called it by its full name, the Nintendo 64, and when the gamecube appeared I called it the gamecube.<br /><br />I know this is off topic they should of really came up with an acronym for Wii to stand for, that would have made me more accepting of its name.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=188">peppers</a> — Sun May 09, 2010 12:20 am</p><hr />

Yeah, PSX and NES don't have anything to do with emulators, they were called that back in the day too.  I have an old Mario comic from the early 90s and on the back it has an ad that says to "play Beetlejuice, Beetlejuice, Beetlejuice, on your NES, NES, NES."  And tepples is right about the PSX being its internal abbreviation that became public.<br /><br />Mainly, people don't call it the Nintendo anymore because there are lots of Nintendo consoles now.  I think the abbreviations came into more common use in the Super Nintendo era, to differentiate.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3438">UncleSporky</a> — Sat May 08, 2010 3:38 pm</p><hr />

It's not that weird considering the first name this console got was "Family Computer" (although I think it was first planned to be called "Home Versatile Computer" or something like that where that HVC initials came from) so clones of course had names based on the Japanese console.<br /><br />Since in your country people speak another language it sounds quite possible that "Family" refers to something that has nothing to do with the English name "family". Here in French we says "baskets" for sneakers, basket is a word imported from English language and has nothing to do with sneakers. There is probably a reason why this word was "wrongly imported" (okay you have to wear sneakers to play basketball but is it really a reason ?).<br />I'm pretty sure a few other English words were wrongly imported in French as well (along with the many, many, many english words which are imported "correctly" and this effect got even more accelerated since everyone visit internet sites in Enlish daily).<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=38">Bregalad</a> — Sat May 08, 2010 9:13 am</p><hr />
