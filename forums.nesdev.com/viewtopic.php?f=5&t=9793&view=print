		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />So when I was sick today I decided to give talking about games a try, so I'll be trying a new thing where I pick a favorite game of mine and talk about why I think it's a good game from a game design perspective. Nothing is planned or scripted, and little to no editing will occur (at least at this point).<br /><br />I made this today, and may try more depending on how this is received. This is my first time really trying to talk to a camera so it's a little awkward for me, and thus very hard to judge for myself.<br /><br />Here's the first one, talking about Gimmick! for Famicom.<br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HtpraoBfojY">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HtpraoBfojY</a><!-- m -->

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />At first I was a little like &quot;OK, get to the game&quot;, but in watching it more (I didn't plan on it, but I ended up watching for a while heh) I found your approach low-key and enjoyable. It was an interesting angle for the TV and yourself so that we could see your face as well as the game. I was wondering how awkward it was sitting at an angle from the screen like that. There's nothing I think should be changed. I like the overall package and hope you continue doing it your way.

I was surprisingly entertained by your character, knowledge, and presentation.  I'd look forward to more additions to the series.<br /><br />So does this mean you won't release another video until you're sick again?

I've played a lot of Gimmick and still learned quite a bit from your commentary ( e.g. I never knew about the secret room above the level 2 treasure.  And I'm curious about your exact cannon timing technique.)  Great job!
