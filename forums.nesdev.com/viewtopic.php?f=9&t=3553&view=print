<br />If I did the stereo mod, extracting audio from the two audio pins, this messes up that calculation, doesn't it?

<br />It sort of matters to me, I'm going to try to put the APU in a FPGA and would like to eventually match the output level and resistance so I can plop my two outputs right into a similar circuit as the original system. Right now I'll try to approximate your normalized measurements with 5% resistor DACs <img src="./images/smilies/icon_lol.gif" alt=":lol:" title="Laughing" /> 
<br />
<br />BTW, is there a logged NES audio format like VGM? That would help a lot; I don't have a CPU yet.

<br />
<br />A logged NES format would be nice for some uses. I'd like th eventually make a logged format suitable for any system, that my sound library could output to for things like this. No reason to have different formats for each system, since logged data is much more similar than ROM-like formats.
<br />
<br />kyuusaku, I found my original notes about how the DACs likely work. It's the model I based the formulas on:
<br />
<br />DACs appear to be implemented with resistors added together. Approximate resistances generated by each DAC, in ohms, where dac is the value to the dac:
<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">rdac = runit / dac</div><br />Each DAC has its own runit:<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">square runit&nbsp; &nbsp;=&nbsp; 8128 ohms<br />triangle runit =&nbsp; 8227 ohms<br />noise runit&nbsp; &nbsp; = 12241 ohms<br />DMC runit&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; = 22638 ohms</div><br />Thus, the DMC's DAC at 127 (maximum) acts like a resistor of approximately 178 ohms (22638 ohms / 127).<br /><br />The DMC, triangle, and noise DACs are connected in parallel to form group 1. The two square DACs are connected in parallel to form group 2. The resistance of a each group can be calculated as follows:<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 1<br />rgroup1 = -------------------------------------<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 1 / rdmc + 1 / rtriangle + 1 / rnoise<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;1<br />rgroup2 = ---------------------------<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 1 / rsquare1 + 1 / rsquare2</div><br />A voltage output for each group is generated by forming a voltage divider with a 100 ohm resistor tied to ground (this is external to the chip), using a 1.17 V input voltage (internal to the chip). The output voltage can be calculated as follows:<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;1.17 * 100<br />vout =&nbsp; ------------<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; rgroup + 100</div><br />The two groups are mixed via 12K and 20K resistors (external to the chip), forming another voltage divider. This can be approximated by simple scaling factors:<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">vout = 0.625 * vgroup1 + 0.375 * vgroup2</div>

<br />There is NESA, which <a href="http://www.emuunlim.com/naz/software.html" class="postlink">A/NES</a> emits, but I don't know of any NSF players or PC-based NES emulators that can output NESA, nor any PC-based players that accept NESA.

<br />(diagram makes some probably very wrong guesses, like which pin is which &amp; the output R should be 66 instead of 166 I guess)

The only other thing to consider (I think) is the Thevenin resistance out so you can predict the level under load, but in this case it should just be the output resistor.

<br />What matters in an audio signal is the voltage. Power comes into play when amplifying at the output.
