<br /><div class="quotetitle">tokumaru wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">If you're rendering columns, with PPU increments set to 32</div>
<br />
<br />I've never understood until just now what PPU increment 32 meant. I thought it had something to do with PPU cycles, or one of those things that just flies over my head. That is really really handy. Hey, if you set PPU increments to 32, can you store something in $2007 32 times, and have it start storing tiles in the next column? Do you get what I'm saying? Well, this is good information to have. But with metatiles, wouldn't you have to like switch between increment 1 and 32? Yeah, you could write 1 meta tile to the Name table, then increment 32, but you'd have to render it in a certain way:
<br />
<br />in meta tile $82:
<br />
<br />render tile $82
<br />render tile $83
<br />render tile $93
<br />render tile $92
<br />increment 32
<br />
<br />because it would start out on the second tile of the next meta tile. If you don't get it, it's okay, because I'm a bad explainer. But yeah, I suppose it would be easier to have 1 meta tile in the pattern tables like:
<br />
<br />0 1
<br />2 3
<br />
<br />instead of
<br />
<br />0 1
<br />10 11
<br />
<br />You know? Yeah, thanks a bunch. But still, how would you take a column, and turn it into an array? I have a lot of thinking to do, I guess.

<br />Anyway, how can that be usefull? Unless you're actually drawing all the game's art a tile at a time, in a tile editor, as was done 15-20 years ago. Come on people, draw the graphics in a more versatile editor. I use MSPAINT, great tool for low-color sprites/tiles. Then I rearrange the tiles (bless the select/scissors tool!) in a way that results in the best performance of the program and use my own program to convert the BMP to the NES format.
<br />
<br />Nah, what the hell... Now I think it's not even such a big difference in Celius' case. An ADC #$10 here or there will not hurt anyone. The biggest problem may be not having tilemaps, but that's his decision when he sees how the levels are going to look when finished. Who knows, it might just work out well.
<br />
<br />I have 1 thing to say about your format though, Celius. If each number indexes 4 tiles, that means you'll be using 64 metatiles, right? I don't think you'll be using a value in between metatiles that will get you a messed up block... Well, if you have only 64 metatiles, you have 2 unused bits that I think you should use to define the palette of the metatile. It's just an idea, to make use of the unused bits. After all, you are doing things in a very compact way, and that's pretty compact. May be a bit hard to decode/handle (although I don't know how you're doing the attributes at this time), but may be worth the space not wasted.

You'd get into an attribute table, I guess, since that's what's after the name table. And it's 30 times, not 32. This happens with rows, though.

Say the player is moving diagonally: set increments to 1, write the first half of a row then the second half, set to 32, write half a column, write the other half. You shoudn't draw 1 full metatile at once, or you'll have to set the write address twice for every metatile and the code will be too slow to fit in VBlank. That's why I told you to draw HALF a metatile at a time. After you draw the first half of all metatiles, then you draw the second half, so that you don't need to set the address excesively or keep switching the increment value.<br /><br />Now that you understand the increment thing, think how it helps to draw half a metatile at a time.

<br />Yeah, that's a good thing. I spent the whole weekend trying to figure out stuff for my game. Got a lot of great ideas I'll be implementing soon. Curiously enough I was thinking about map rendering, metatiles and scrolling, the same stuff we're talking about here (although I put some emphasis to attributes). =)

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />What I meant by turning a column into an array was considering a 1 dimensional array/map as a 2 dimensional array, and taking a column from the 2 dimensional one, and turning it into a 1 dimensional array. Like say here:
<br />
<br />00 03 23 54 13 64 34 72 74
<br />43 74 34 64 23 53 23 75 27
<br />00 03 23 54 13 64 34 72 74
<br />43 74 34 64 23 53 23 75 27
<br />00 03 23 54 13 64 34 72 74
<br />43 74 34 64 23 53 23 75 27
<br />00 03 23 54 13 64 34 72 74
<br />43 74 34 64 23 53 23 75 27
<br />
<br />I want to get the first column:
<br />
<br />00
<br />43
<br />00
<br />43
<br />00
<br />43
<br />00
<br />43
<br />
<br />into an array: 00 43 00 43 00 43 00 43
<br />
<br />So I can use PPU increment 32 and write that array to $2007, and get a column of meta tiles. How would I easily do such a thing?

<br />Exactly as I described with the sample code. Let's take your sample array. You'll loop through the array, starting from the first metatile (00). So, this metatile translates to tiles:
<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">00 01<br />10 11<br /></div> You're interested in tiles 00 and 10, wich make the first half of the column, so, write those to your array/buffer.<br /><br />Now, move to the next metatile, wich in your example is 9 metatiles later, but in the actual game it probably is 16 later (just as the PPU has to increment 32 to move down at the tile level, you have to add 16 to move down at the metatile level), right? So, add 16 to the pointer so you can read the next metatile. It is 43. This translates to:<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">43 44<br />53 54<br /></div> Again, we're (and will be, until the column ends) interested in the first half, so write values 43 and 53 to the array/buffer (wich now has values 00, 10, 43, 53). Add 16 to the pointer to read the next metatile... and so on, so on.
<br />
<br />By the end of the last metatile you'll have a clean 1D buffer to write lightning fast to the name table during VBlank.
<br />
<br />Tip: since you'll already be running through all the metatiles, store their other half into another 1D buffer, so you can draw one after the other during VBlank. It doesn't get better than this.
<br />
<br />EDIT: you'll won't get an array "00 43 00 43 00 43 00 43" because those are metatile numbers, and you'll draw tiles to the name tables, not metatiles. Well, I'm assuming those are metatile numbers, 'cause that's what you use to make the screen maps, and that's what you'll have aligned in grids like that.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Hey, Bregalad, that would be the logical choice for defining metatiles, but Celius seems to be aiming for maximun compression here. Apparently he's trying to fit code, maps and everything withing a 16kb bank, so I would think he actually <strong>needs</strong> to make things as compact as possible.
<br />
<br />The metatile code defines the first tile used, and the other 3 are calculated from the first. It results in a limited number of metatiles and waste of pattern table space, but it's a very compact way to define metatiles. I don't know how he's handling the other attributes of the metatiles though, such as palette, collision, etc. Maybe it is all hardcoded based on the metatile index, I wouldn't be surprised.
<br />
<br />I do metatiles in my game exactly as you described, each one using 5 bytes. I have some separate height maps used to make slopes and such, something you don't need in an RPG.

<br />If you really want to save space, go for two group of metatiles (with hardcored numbers). For example metatiles 0-31 are 4 consecutive tiles, and metatiles 32-63 are custom tiles. I do that in my current project, but I don't think it would be fair in a large RPG.

Scince the goal is to get the result in a larger ROM, I think metatiles doesn't have to suffer of stupid restrictions.
<br />Simply encode all metatiles sets for a standard game plus a map editor in 16kb is decent.

Oh crap! I forgot about CHRRAM, that'll be a crap load of graphics data. I'm blabbering. But I just wanted to make that clear, that I was not saying I could fit all maps in 1 16k PRG bank... And the code I was referring to was the code to load the map in the bank, so I wouldn't have to bankswitch and slow things down. I wish I could compact it all in 1 bank...
