In the forest/jungle it's $17 (ignore the sand tiles at the bottom of the second screen, they should be dirt.) Changing the UBC to blue I feel I could work around it and still make the sand (and the trunks of the palm trees, which share the same palette) look good, but for the palms (which has the palette $37,$1A,$29,$17), this wouldn't work because all three of the colors are already used (plus the background color to make it look like it's on sand.)

Even if you're doing heavily stylized graphics, looking at good reference pictures will help you choose what to emphasize/distort/replace/maintain.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">Sogona wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">Yeah, the main character does only use one palette (black outline, caucasian skin, and brown for the hair and pants)</div><br />I can think of very few cases where NES sprites turned out good when using black outlines and a single palette, and if you think about it, wasting 33% of the colors just on outlines doesn't sound very sensible.<br /><br />I personally don't like sprite outlines, but if you really must have them, maybe it would be better to use a dark shade of an actual color that you can reuse. You could easily use the same dark brown for outlines, pants and hair, freeing one slot for a more interesting color. You can highlight the brown areas using a light shade so that they don't look flat. Just an idea.<br /><br />There's something weird about the animation too, because the guy projects his body forward when attacking down but not when attacking right or up. These are supposed to be different views of the same movement, so they should match.<br /><br />This is actually another good opportunity to use reference material. Watch videos/animations of sword fights, or even try to do these movements yourself. When people make a stabbing movement, they usually put one foot forward, for balance. Your character is currently bending his knees or doing nothing with his legs (depending from where you're looking), so that's definitely something that can be improved.

Also, in the attack animation the arm changes from a muscular one to a thin one when it is stretched out.<br />I know it may be difficult to work with the low resolution, but it's just too noticeable to me, so I'd recommend some tweaking.<br /><br />Considering that pixels are a bit 'fat' when the Famicom screen is viewed on a authentic NTSC screen (pixel aspect ratio is 8:7, according to the <a href="http://wiki.nesdev.com/w/index.php/Overscan" class="postlink">wiki</a>), it could look even worse on a real 4:3 TV (and horrible if someone just stretched the display on a 16:9 wide screen monitor).<br /><br />Awwwwww! The forums said I was logged out nearly every time I tried to submit the reply, and I had to repeatly re-login until it worked.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Color contrast is important when designing a character and the stages. Right now, your character is pale yellow and medium brown... Of the three colors shown in your backgrounds, which the player will constantly be in front of, one is primarily pale yellow. The other is primarily light brown. Ever wonder why &quot;soldiers&quot; dressed in bright blues and reds in overhead shooters like Ikari Warriors (instead of the greens and browns actual soldiers wear for camouflage)?<br /><br />As for the sprite: consistency between angles, consistency between frames, and appropriate, realistic movement for actions such as walking, attacking, etc. all need to be focused on.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Sorry for taking so long to get back with this.<br /><br />I finally decided that there was no way to have the player's animation look good when attacking downward and still have the weapon spawned below the hitbox, so I decided to make the hitbox only 15x15 pixels when the player is in that respective state and direction. This does present the issue of the weapon being hard to see, since now there's sprite flicker. I guess I could tweak the engine slightly to draw object 1 (hard-coded to be the player's weapon) first, and then objects 0 and 2-15. Or, since I'm using CHR-RAM, I could dynamically load the sprite of the player's leg drawn around the weapon depending on the weapon being used. I'll see.<br /><br />I've done numerous small tweaks to the graphics and frames of animation. The frames for when he's standing are different, so that when he attacks it looks more like he's lunging. I'm still not fully satisfied when he's attacking up and down, as the legs still look kinda weird and ambiguous for what he's supposed to be doing. But here's how everything looks right now:<br /><div class="attachtitle">Attachment:</div><div class="attachcontent">
