The CC65 binaries total about 1 MB, and GnuWin32 make together with the required DLLs (2 as far as I know) is about 1 MB as well, should be able to fit that under the 20 MB (?) size limit. Anyway, if you're thinking of running external installers for CC65/make, I wouldn't do that, just throw the binaries in there.

Installations (not installers) of GNU Make and CC65 are now delivered alongside the NESICIDE executables and libraries by the installer.<br />2. Settings are now stored .INI-style either in the platform-native location for such (%APPDATA%/CSPSoftware/NESICIDE.ini in Windows, etc.) or in the local directory of the installation.  If you install to, and run from, a memory stick, for example, the NESICIDE.ini will be taken from the memory stick.  Builds from now on will ignore any Windows registry debris left by earlier versions.<br /><br />Unfortunately, for now, this requires external modification of the PATH environment variable so NESICIDE can find the GNU Make and CC65 tools.  I'm hoping to find a way to get around this, but it may be as clunky as specifying full paths on all subprocess invocations.  If you've installed GNU Make and CC65 yourself and they are already in your PATH, NESICIDE will just use those ones.<br /><br />I added a bit of text to the Environment Settings, general page that shows where NESICIDE is currently retrieving its .INI file from.

The fact that it finds &quot;src/nes.h&quot; must mean that the current working directory in your case is the directory of the project. In my case that doesn't seem to be the case.<br /><br />Actually, now that I reopen the project, even if I modify it to &quot;src/nes.h&quot; it works, so NESICIDE probably set the working directory now for some reason, but didn't do it before.<br /><br />Try this: remove nesicide.ini and reinstall NESICIDE. Remove CC65 and make from PATH. Create a new project based on the Hello World template, and try compiling it.<br /><br />Whatever turns out to be the reason, doing .include &quot;src/nes.h&quot; is not the &quot;right thing&quot;.<br /><br />EDIT: I don't know what is going on, but the Makefile/&quot;Compile Project&quot; is also not working correctly. Even if I modify main.s, it doesn't recompile the project when I press &quot;Compile Project&quot;.

That is why there was a push to get the compiler bundled to begin with.  If a power user wants to use his own version, said power user should also be able to resolve any strange behaviors brought about by use [or misuse] of compiler directives that behave differently between compiler versions.
