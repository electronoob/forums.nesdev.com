		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Okay, this is all extremely complex, with many things that could go wrong any moments, so I have opted not to do this yet.  Let me discuss the situation.<br /><br />1. ALL CHANGES THAT DIFFERENTIATE FROM STOCK SOFTWARE MUST BE DOCUMENTED/PATCHES/DIFFS MADE.  I do this any time I make a change; this responsibility falls on me, but minimising the number of diffs from stock software is important.  Failure to do this results in basically 100% inability for ANY kind of software upgrades to reliably be done.  Rephrased: the more one-offs we have to deal with, the more painful upgrades (of MediaWiki, MW extensions, forum software, whatever) become.  I think Tepples knows bits/pieces of what the situation is, and I know other bits/pieces.<br /><br />At this time we already have one diff for SyntaxHighlighter, and I will explain what it contains (two things):<br /><br />i) Modifies SyntaxHighlighter.php to include &quot;6502&quot; and &quot;asm&quot; SyntaxHighlighter engine references, which refer directly to the engine called &quot;Assembly6502&quot;.<br /><br />ii) Installs a new file, scripts/shBrushAssembly6502.js, which is quite small (1.9KBytes).  Your .zip file contains a replacement that appears to be almost identical to this (but not entirely), but the filename is called shBrush6502.js so I would need to rename it (not a problem).<br /><br />2. The default shCore.js file is 16175 bytes.  The shCore-nesdev.js file in the .zip you uploaded is 72517 bytes.  This is enormous for Javascript, by the way.  After a review of it, it looks to me like it needs to be packed or what's otherwise known as &quot;minified&quot;.  I have no idea how to pack anything related to Javascript (edit: maybe <a href="http://compressorrater.thruhere.net/" class="postlink">this is helpful</a>), but there's no way we're putting a 72KByte JS file into place.  Minified should be significantly smaller.<br /><br />3. The author of SyntaxHighlighter, on his site last month, <a href="http://alexgorbatchev.com/SyntaxHighlighter/" class="postlink">stated that he's working on maintaining the thing once more</a>.  However no where in github does he provide the built versions (and I don't know if they're packed/minified).<br /><br />I won't be changing anything to &quot;include shCore-nesdev.js rather than shCore.js&quot; because that just creates more one-offs.  Instead I'll just have to name the thing shCore.js, once a packed version can be provided.<br /><br />Don't worry about the comments at that Javascript packing site about gzip or webserver compression; that's stuff that has to happen within Apache/on the server side and would require WhoaMan to make changes (it helps substantially).  What I used on Parodius was below (and greatly relied upon mod_mime_magic to help properly detect things too):<br /><br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">LoadModule deflate_module libexec/apache22/mod_deflate.so<br />LoadModule mime_magic_module libexec/apache22/mod_mime_magic.so<br /><br />&lt;IfModule deflate_module&gt;<br />&nbsp; AddOutputFilterByType DEFLATE text/plain<br />&nbsp; AddOutputFilterByType DEFLATE text/html<br />&nbsp; AddOutputFilterByType DEFLATE text/css<br />&nbsp; AddOutputFilterByType DEFLATE text/csv<br />&nbsp; AddOutputFilterByType DEFLATE text/xml<br />&nbsp; AddOutputFilterByType DEFLATE application/xml<br />&nbsp; AddOutputFilterByType DEFLATE application/xhtml+xml<br />&nbsp; AddOutputFilterByType DEFLATE application/javascript<br />&nbsp; BrowserMatch &quot;^Mozilla/4&quot; gzip-only-text/html<br />&nbsp; BrowserMatch &quot;^Mozilla/4\.0&#91;678&#93;&quot; no-gzip<br />&nbsp; BrowserMatch &quot;\bMSIE&quot; !no-gzip !gzip-only-text/html<br />&lt;/IfModule&gt;<br /></div>

Minified should be significantly smaller.</div><br />Meh, I agree that 70 KB is on the large side, but the JavaScript files typically are static, so the browser will download them once and cache them for a good time. More often than not, the browser will also accept them gzipped.<br /><br />The reason I didn't compress the JavaScript was that the first packer that popped up on Google (<!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://dean.edwards.name/packer/">http://dean.edwards.name/packer/</a><!-- m -->) broke the script.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">I won't be changing anything to &quot;include shCore-nesdev.js rather than shCore.js&quot; because that just creates more one-offs.  Instead I'll just have to name the thing shCore.js, once a packed version can be provided.</div><br />Feel free to do whatever you want with the files.<br /><br />Anyway, I guess I should tell you how shCore-nesdev.js was (manually) built:<br />1) Started with src/shCore.js from the distribution ZIP.<br />2) Took the file scripts/XRegExp.js from the repo (<!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://github.com/alexgorbatchev/syntaxhighlighter/tree/3.0.83/scripts">https://github.com/alexgorbatchev/synta ... 83/scripts</a><!-- m -->) and pasted it on top of the shCore.js file. This dependency was missing from the distribution ZIP, but was probably added to the packed shCore.js file in the build process.<br />3) Applied my modifications to the shCore source. You can find them from shCore-nesdev.js by searching for &quot;thefox&quot;. It's only 3 lines.<br /><br />There are some build scripts in the SyntaxHighlighter repo to automate the packing/etc, but I couldn't bother to install PHP to run them.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />So here's the status:<br /><br />1. I've put things into place verbatim, and they do seem to work.  That said:<br /><br />2. I had to Shift-Reload to pick up the .js changes.  I was a little surprised by this, given that the file sizes differ substantially (old vs. new) as well as file timestamps, so I'm not sure what's going on there.  I think MediaWiki does offer some way to force a cache update for clients, but I don't think that'd affect this because its not the MediaWiki page content itself that changed, only the stuff referenced by &lt;script&gt; (the filenames haven't changed, etc.).  That should all be server-side/Apache-side as far as HTTP server vs. client headers go.<br /><br />3. All the packers I tried did in fact break the Javascript as you said.  Some got them down to reasonable sizes (17KBytes), but they'd break with syntax errors / missing semicolon and the like.  As such, I'm going to put in a request to WhoaMan to enable mod_deflate (either for all of Apache or just within the nesdev VirtualHost contexts) to rectify the situation.  It's the best I can do.<br /><br />The reason the file size matters so much is both an issue of wasted network bandwidth and overall speed (it now takes 6x longer to download that single .js file, plus the time it takes to parse it/run it on the client).  76KBytes of JavaScript probably isn't going to make things like tablets (ex. Kindle devices) and other embedded devices very happy.  I'm crossing my fingers though.  If we get complaints, I'm pulling the entire syntax highlighting crap out entirely and will manually go through all the pages and remove the tags (this takes me an hour plus to do).<br /><br />I think it's utterly ridiculous how crappy all these syntax highlighters are.  I keep seeing new ones pop up on the web all over the place on blogs and so on, but god only knows what's going on under the hood there.

For example your <tt style="margin-left: 2px; margin-right: 2px; padding:3px; background-color: #3355aa; color: white;">Cite.tar</tt> is 644 right now).<br /><br />For the file permissions stuff, just stick <tt style="margin-left: 2px; margin-right: 2px; padding:3px; background-color: #3355aa; color: white;">umask 0002</tt> (default is 0022) in your <tt style="margin-left: 2px; margin-right: 2px; padding:3px; background-color: #3355aa; color: white;">.bashrc</tt> on the server and that should take care of new file creation permissions being correct going forward.
