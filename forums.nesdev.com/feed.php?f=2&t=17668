It's difficult to do 24 bit numbers in C, especially with how cumbersome 32 bit numbers are in CC65. All I could suggest for this is to be sparing with the promotion to 32 bits, and do some of the relevant work in assembly instead.<br /><br />At the same time, it's difficult to do efficient arrays of anything bigger than byte-size in C as well. If you have an array of objects, there's a big advantage in assembly to storing each byte of this 24-bit number in a separate array. (&quot;Structure of arrays&quot; idiom.) Unfortunately it's cumbersome to use this kind of data in C, but like above I guess the advice is to try and minimize it, and be prepared to write some assembly. I don't think there's really any good way to do this in CC65 C, but you can plan to do some assembly optimization as needed.<br /><br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">ab = a&#91;i&#93; | (b&#91;i&#93; &lt;&lt; 8);<br />a&#91;i&#93; = (ab &gt;&gt; 0) &amp; 0xFF;<br />b&#91;i&#93; = (ab &gt;&gt; 8) &amp; 0xFF;<br />// a/b are both static unsigned char arrays<br />// ab is a static short int<br />// i is an unsigned char</div><br />The above code is relatively efficient on CC65, because it does at least tend to handle byte-aligned operations like &lt;&lt; 8 fairly well, and if you can use static variables where possible a lot of its internal stack use can be minimized. I think overall with careful use of 8 bit stripes, and a few macros to help you pack and unpack them, you'll end up with faster and smaller code than using 16 bit arrays. (Even with 24 bits its probably still a win over using arrays of 32-bit numbers... though the necessary casting up to 32-bit is going to hurt any way you do it except assembly.)<br /><br />Note above that <strong>i</strong> being an unsigned char + both <strong>a</strong> and <strong>b</strong> being char arrays means that they can be fetched and stored with <strong>LDA abs, X/Y</strong> / <strong>STA abs, X/Y</strong>, which you don't get if either of those conditions isn't true. (For arrays of short int, it always has to promote the index to 16 bits.)<br /><br />9.7 is OK if you need compactness and are only 2 screens wide, but the extra shift is very cumbersome for the code (in both assembly and C). Splitting in other sizes (e.g. 12.4) is not very good on the 6502. That works much better on processors that can shift more than 1 bit at a time.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=5165">rainwarrior</a> — Thu Aug 16, 2018 3:58 pm</p><hr />

Both <em>Haunted</em> games use 16.8 displacements and 8.8 velocities. One drawback with 12.4 is that you may need to keep 16-bit displacements longer than you would with 16.8. In 16.8, you can ignore subpixel positions, subtract 16-bit pixel positions, reject displacements more than 128 pixels apart early, and save 8-bit pixel displacements for later processing. In 12.4, by contrast, a 20-pixel displacement between two objects is 320 units, which is solidly a 16-bit number.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=9">tepples</a> — Thu Aug 16, 2018 2:21 pm</p><hr />

I have some experience writing physics engines (Chipmunk2D), and want to try and see how far I can go with that on the NES. So far I've gotten circle-circle and circle-line collisions working with reasonable performance, and am working on reducing it further with some small lookup tables. My end goal is a game with a two wheeled vehicle. So far I've been using 8.8 fixed point because it's easy to prototype with from C, but I'm hoping to get at least 2 screen scrolling. So I was thinking about my options for using fixed point.<br /><br />If I wanted to stick with 16 bit types I could do something like 9.7 or 12.4 depending on how much accuracy feels right in the fractional bits for acceleration and such. All the extra shifting gets messy real fast in C, and I can only imagine moreso in assembly. Having a lot of multi-byte shifts seems like it might really bloat and slow the code too.<br /><br />16.8 is sort of appealing for the final assembly version. If I wanted to access the values from C I'd need to split the integer and fractional parts into a struct. I've already kind of ruled out padding it out to 32 bits. Even with a lot of casting and type annotations for 16/8 bit ops, I wasn't able to get cc65 to generate reasonable code using 32 bit ints.<br /><br />What have other people had good success with? Is 16.8 the way to go, or is something like 9.7 less troublesome than I think it is?<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=8849">slembcke</a> — Thu Aug 16, 2018 11:48 am</p><hr />
