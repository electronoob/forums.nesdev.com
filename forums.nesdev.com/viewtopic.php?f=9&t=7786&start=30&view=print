<br />AFAIK, you can use any mapper number you want, even used ones, as long as you give the PowerPak a corresponding mapper file. The PowerPak has no idea that the file "MAP04.MAP" is for the MMC3, so if you overwrite it with your own mapper and load your ROM set to mapper 4 it will play just fine. I think it works like this, please correct me if I'm wrong.

<br />
<br />Yeah I meant the PowerPak.  I apologize for my inattentiveness.  What about the powerpak makes it incompatible with clones?  It looks like the question has been brought up before but never explained why.

<br />
<br />The what? I don't quite follow.
<br />
<br />If you are referring to the fine products offered by RetroZone (<a href="http://www.retrousb.com/product_info.php?cPath=24&amp;products_id=42" class="postlink">here</a> and <a href="http://www.retrousb.com/product_info.php?cPath=24&amp;products_id=43" class="postlink">here</a>) I for one already have the MMC1 board. Now if I can get an EEPROM programmer that works <img src="./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" />
<br />
<br />Or if you are talking about the Squweedo boards that Memblers made, those look awesome for music stuff but a lot of overkill for general game use.
<br />
<br />Or the Munchousen cart, which from what I can tell is a dead project.
<br />
<br />What we are discussing in this thread (and several others) is mapper capability above and beyond what is currently offered by any of those products / projects.
<br />
<br />Not that I am terribly concerned with it all, I just want a cart that I can plug into USB to load my ROMs on that supports MMC1 (or MMC3, or UNROM, or FME7, or whatever).

The major difficulty in this project is getting boards made, not the mapper designs if that's what you mean.
