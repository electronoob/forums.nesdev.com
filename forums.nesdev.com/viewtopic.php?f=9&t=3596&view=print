		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Well, it's been awhile since I posted about it.   CopyNES parts are nearly gone-  I have 17 or so boards left which I have stuffed.
<br />
<br />I will not have enough of the DB 25 cables to go around, however I do have the IDC cables made up.  As stated, I stuffed the boards and they will be tested, but I need to order a few more parts to finish the run out.
<br />
<br />The new cost of the boards is $55 for a stuffed/tested board.  I will include the DB 25 cables until I run out, and I will take orders one at a time.   I am pretty much out of parts after this too-  I do not have any more blanks.
<br />
<br />As stated, the boards are stuffed so all you have to do is remove your NES CPU, solder the socket in, and plug the board in and cut a hole for the DB-25, and replace the cap by the lockout chip.
<br />
<br />The board itself is fully tested so I KNOW it works before I send <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":-)" title="Smile" />  
<br />
<br />I have to obtain the last parts for them, but I have about 5 shippable.
<br />
<br />First 5 emails gets 'em.  $55 + $7 shipping.
<br />
<br />One to a NEW customer please.  No hoarding allowed, and sorry but I cannot ship these out of the US any more.  The US post orifice has made it incredibly difficult and time consuming to do so.  Sorry.

<br />
<br />Also, how much would it take to make a device that connects a cartridge to a computer for the purpose of flashing the cart (using the same method the CopyNES flash mod uses)?  BunnyBoy's PowerPak requires CopyNES to reprogram the boot ROM, and recently the boot ROM code was updated.  A number of PowerPak users are upset by the fact that they have to get a CopyNES if they want the bug fixes.

<br />
<br />I have the orders I got so far boxed up, they are going out tomorrow.  I have 12 more, but only about 5 more cables.  I got the Jameco parts today, so I finished stuffing the last boards.  They are 100% tested now and all worked.
<br />
<br />Once these 12 boards are gone, I won't make any more (unless someone wants to pay me to buy 100 blank boards, then they can have fun selling them or whatever, hehe).    The page will remain up, I am still developing with it, and it isn't dying in that respect.
<br />
<br />However, I'm done with production and kits.  (the kits were actually a pain in the ass, even though there wasn't very many parts in it, I still occasionally screwed up and put in the wrong parts or whatnot, even triple checking.  It's much easier to sell a completely assembled and tested board-  I know it works, and it has all the parts on it).
<br />
<br />This proves to me that making kits is incredibly difficult and time consuming, and it'd be a complete disaster to attempt such a thing for an FPGA NES.  I've had alot of people asking me if I'd sell kits for that, but OMG I can't imagine packing up parts the size of a flea, and then people getting it have to be able to solder fine pitch SMD and ant-sized resistors/caps. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":-)" title="Smile" />
<br />
<br />The FPGA NES isn't dead by any means, but it's just not cost effective right now to sell that.  People are squawking about the Powerpak being only like $135 or whatever, they wouldn't like the $250 or so cost of my FPGA console.   I completed the NES/fami pretty much and it's 100% accurate with 100% complete Vs. system support, including ALL the funny PPUs, mappers, and protection chips I can get ahold of.  I need someone to loosen their grip on some of the weird-ass japanese Vs. boards so I can complete the Vs. RE project.
<br />
<br />Sorry about the post rambling a bit off topic there. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":-)" title="Smile" />

<br />then if somebody wants one they can just print out the image and make the board themselves or just send it off to sparkfun or others like them and have it made. That would be pretty much as easy as buying a kit and everybody’s happy
