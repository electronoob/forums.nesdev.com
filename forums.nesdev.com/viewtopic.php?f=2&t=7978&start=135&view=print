		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Yes, as QPSK is just 0011, 0110, 1100, or 1001 from the ADC. A greater-depth ADC primarily helps with the higher data rates as it allows finding more precise transition times with cubic interpolation. But in this case, MFM or some other advanced RLL is probably the better choice.

That would make this idea even more interesting because you could actually load graphics.</div><br />It doesn't matter whether this cart uses CHR-RAM or CHR-ROM, once you swap carts the CHR you have access to is the one in the cart being dumped. If it's RAM, you can indeed upload some patterns from main RAM (the code/data decated to this should be minimal though, since there's only 2KB of RAM and most of it should be dedicated to dumping, not graphics), but there's nothing you can do if the new cart uses CHR-ROM.

Well, the EXACT opposite of what TapeDump does would be to use the Famicom microphone to load programs...! Too bad the NES doesn't have one. Anyway, what would the other end of the cable connect to?

So, minigames under 2KB? Sounds cool, specially considering you can use self-modifying code (and you can use .db for initializing variables, saving you the space of a few LDAs/STAs). You could even decompress tiles to VRAM and then decompress the game program to occupy the space that was previously used by compressed graphics.

(and they'd need some way to hook it up to a ntsc/pal NES). It's probably easier to aquire a keyboard than building your own custom controller cable though.<br /><br />I like tepples's zapper idea, this would really match the tapedump program. And it is very accesible, anyone with a crt tv and a zapper should be able to get it working. (if we do it right, any device with a controllable light should work if it can match the right frequencies)<br /><br />edit: before this gets out of hand. Split?

Since the picture is updated at 60Hz (NTSC) and the only information you can convey through the zapper is light/dark, you'll only be able to transfer 60 bits per second. That would mean 4 1/2 minutes to transfer a measly 2KB of data, not considering extra control and error correction data!<br /><br />2- How are you going to get the information to show up on the TV? You can generate a video on the PC and put it in a thumb drive or a DVD and play it on your DVD player, but that's hardly efficient. Because of the low popularity of CRT TVs these days we can hardly find video cards that can output composite/s-video, so we really don't have many options.
