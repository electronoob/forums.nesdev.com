But if you just want to develop on a system like the NES, but hate some of the limits you have with the NES, the SNES really is the way to go. The SPC will be an issue for sound, but the rest of it is pretty nice. As Disch said you have lots of RAM, VRAM, faster cpu, better graphics, DMA, etc. Anything you would want to do on NES or just barely couldn't do on NES you can do with SNES. <br /><br />SNES is probably easier except for the SPC issue. It's a shame because I think the SPC issue is the main reason you don't see more SNES homebrew. It's a better system than the NES for it too thanks to the large amount of Copiers and Flash Cartridges out there. Atleast that's my opinion.</div>
<br />
<br />There is a couple of problems: I could not find a perfect SNES map editor. and VRAM/OAM is harder on SNES (as in Layers and how to make them work). so a real map editor for windows is probably improbable
<br />
<br />I also heard that there are 2 SPC trackers in development called SPC tracker and Solar Soundtrack. But SPC tracker is making it so far

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />What are you talking about a perfect SNES map editor? It's very easy to program a tiled map editor. I could do that in very little time. 
<br />
<br />I see in no way how SNES's VRAM and OAM is harder. It is infact easier thanks to DMA, and I don't find it hard to understand how stuff works.
<br />
<br />Making a map editor for a SNES game in windows has been done by tons of people that have been hacking games like Super Mario World and Super Metroid. 
<br />
<br />You're not going to "find" and editor for making your game, well unless you find a universal type like 'Mappy'. You'll have to program it yourself. This is not hard if you understand even alittle programming. If you can't make an editor, you need to start with the basics of programming and game development.
