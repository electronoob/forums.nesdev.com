There easily could be more jsr than rts or vice versa depending from code (both cases were mentioned), but logically, every executred jsr has only one executred rts, and it can't lack the rts unless some tricky stack manipulation with jmp instead of rts is involved.
<br />
<br />I have only one idea then - probably the stats didn't count NMI/IRQ as jsr, but count their rts.

So what you mention wouldn't affect the count. And yeah, I have multiple RTSs as well. One of the few things that saves bytes AND cycles. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /> <br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">I have only one idea then - probably the stats didn't count NMI/IRQ as jsr, but count their rts.</div>
<br />
<br />NMI/IRQ don't use rts ($60). They use RTI ($40). It's gotta be tricky stack things, or just the fact that logging may have stopped in the middle of a subroutine so the RTS wasn't logged. (Or I'm just wrong about my assumptions of how this was done, in which case I'll wear my dunce cap.)

<br />Also, here's the raw numbers for JSR and RTS (not percentages):
<br />36,737,719   JSR
<br />36,448,572   RTS
<br />A difference of about 300,000 more executions of JSR than RTS.  I'm trying to think of which game would have aborted so many function calls.
<br />It would have been early in the alphabet, before "D", since I stopped logging after PocketNES crashed due to a bug in old versions of VBA (GBA Scanline IRQs are broken in old VBA)

<br />My method:  Start profiling after main gameplay starts, and play for a short time before ending.  Sometimes I beat the level, sometimes I don't.
<br />Game selection is a tad random, mostly some games I picked that are in the #-D range of the alphabet.

<br />Speedhacks remove many of the endless idle loops, but not for all games.

<br />Surprises:
<br />Super Mario Bros and Bionic Commando seem to love JSR without RTS.
<br />STA $xx is more common than LDA $xx in many games.
<br />Cosmic Epsilon really likes NOP.
<br />
<br />
<br />No surprise:
<br />Nobody likes the ($xx,X) addressing mode.

<br />Except 1942, which has LDA ($xx,X) as about 0.5%, and Back to the Future, which has it at 0.3%. A few games had it even lower but roughly commensurate with how I guess my sound engine uses the mode.
<br />
<br />How do you set up VBA to make these profiles? I wanna try it with some homebrew games.

<br />Fairly common in NES games over all, from what I have seen. I have disassembled a few games, and I have found this paradigm in more than half of them. Castlevania, Solstice, Super Mario Bros., and Solomon's Key are a few examples.
<br />Solomon's Key however is an interesting case, because it uses a voluntary co-thread model. Yes, it runs up to 8 threads in "parallel", with a dedicated stack for each of them, and a tiny task switching function which is called with "jsr" and returns with "rts" but switches stack pointers in the midst, so it returns to a different invocation than where it was called from.
