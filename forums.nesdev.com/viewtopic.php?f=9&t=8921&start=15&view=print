<br />
<br />'Crazy' solutions like this were popular in early 1990s in hobbyist electronics, and this is very simple one comparing to some I saw, like <a href="http://ra4nal.qrz.ru/images/shtvp_bg.gif" class="postlink">PAL encoder</a> with signal waveforms stored in a ROM.

<br />
<br />In that case you're looking at more like $0.40 for the decode flag rom.
<br />
<br />With that I'd consider your design INTERESTING vice CRAZY... <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />

<br />
<br />I believe if you filled your ROM with $FF values for all those values, it might give the correct results in a NES system if you use NMOS-based memory in your cart, since NMOS technology causes 0s to 'win' over 1s, functionally giving a binary and. Of course, this might give totally different results on a clone system where the CPU is not an NMOS 6502.
<br />
<br />...but as other have pointed out here before, even if it works it might be a bad thing to do, as this could create more wear on the circuits. 
<br />
<br />Then again, I guess the same thing might apply to unofficial 6502 opcodes like SAX (and A and X and store result), and I've never seen any recommendations against using those based on electrical wear, only compatibility. Maybe try building this cart and run it for a year's time to prove it's safe enough? :)

<br />
<br />Therefore, in any technology, the '0' should always win, unless your technology uses oversized P-Channel transistors, which is unlikely to happen.
<br />
<br />Back to the subject I think NROM, and any non-bankswitched mapper could easily be extended to 40kb, the problem is the iNES header only allowing for 16kb increment.
<br />
<br />Therefore, 40kb can happen in hardware but now on iNES, but 48kb can exist on iNES, but not in hardware because of the sound/control regs.
<br />
<br />Conclusion -&gt; it's better to move to use a mapper if you really can't make things fit in 32kb.

<br />Personally I wouldn't touch anything that intentionally causes bus conflicts with a 10ft pole.  Just plan BAD design.  Shiru's proposal prevents this while it's not conventional it's logically sound so it's just an interesting yet valid solution.

<br />
<br />You can always have your adress decoded like :
<br />/OE = M2 * !A14 * !/ROMSEL * (A9 + A8 + A7 + ... + A0)
<br />
<br />This will give you linear adress space from $4020 to $7fff (and a second EPROM will handle $8000-$ffff as usual) and this can be done with a PAL/GAL chip easily. You could even probably do the logic to use all $4018 to $7fff.
<br />
<br />While I fully agree it makes sense, form a software viewpoint, to avoid bankswitching completely, in hardware it takes less chips (or cheaper/simpler chips) to bankswitch the ROM at $8000-$ffff, which is why that's the way Nintendo did it.

<br />
<br />Not really follow the 46K with 74238/9 idea, though. lidnariq, could you please explain it? Seems to be a good trade, small chunk of memory vs. PCB size.
<br />
<br />Edit: E1 and E2 to A15,A14 and A0-A2 to A11-A13, with one of outputs enabling the ROM, something like that?

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I'd designed something, posted it, and then realized it conflicted with the internal PPU and RAM — the design mapped the ROM into everything <em>except</em> $4000-$47ff. Oops. Fixing that is trivial, but involves another gate; if we're trying for a single IC solution it's lacking.
<br />
<br />Let me try again, triple-checked this time, using a 74'85. Unfortunately, this only gets you 44kB ($5000-$ffff).
<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;M2 -&gt; A3<br />/PRGSEL -&gt; B2 and ROM A15<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; A14 -&gt; A1<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; A13 -&gt; A0<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; A12 -&gt; A&gt;Bin<br />ROM /CE &lt;- A&lt;Bout<br />vcc = B3, A2, B1<br />gnd = B0, A=Bin, A&lt;Bin</div>Since the CPU's A15 is inverted for /PRGSEL, the top 32kB of address space would be on the bottom of the ROM and vice versa.
<br />
<br />I'm not certain whether the '85 (add an 8 input OR) or '238 design is a better starting place if you're willing to add another IC to increase selecting memory by up to 4kB more. Either way, it sadly feels like diminishing returns.

This is the main reason of bank switching - good compromise between capacity and simplicity. Keep in mind, when Famicom/NES been released and cost of IC's at the time. Early 80' - 32kB memory were huge space.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I think, goal of an extendend NROM design could be defined as '3 chips only with max amount of memory available'. Three chips are CHR and PRG ROMs + an extra chip, the latter is preferably cheap and compact one.
<br />
<br />Since 40K would require decoding anyway, 44K is not too bad. Of course, more would be better, but it seems that the max is only possible to get with a CPLD or an extra ROM as decoder. I think, with all pros and cons the 7485 design wins over CPLD/ROM.

<br />
<br />* Well, "never" as in it's transiently so at the end of a cycle that addressed $8000-$ffff. While M2=/ROMSEL=0, it'll act the same as though M2=/ROMSEL=1, so any glitching would only happen after reads from $c800-$ffff, should be fast enough to not propagate through the 74'85, and should be after the hold time for the CPU is over.
<br />
<br />edit: misread the truth table, needed output to be inverted A11, corrections are *starred*
