Technically, gameboy is 2bpp, and it clearly has worse graphics than NES.<br /><br />Maybe color palette?<br /><br />NES has 6 bits 0-3f of color to choose from...oh let's say 4 bits of palette 0-f, vs SNES has 15 bits of color on a (what is it ?) 7 bits of palette. that would mean SNES is far more than NES, but NES isn't really 8 bits of graphics...only 6 at most. Gameboy still just the 2 bits of color. That part makes a little sense.<br /><br />But, some people might refer to Gameboy as 8 bit graphics, I would argue less.<br /><br />If we're talking CPU bits (I know we are). That would mean Atari 2600 has 8 bit graphics. But it's not even in the same ballpark as NES. Only 40 pixels wide, and severe color limits. And look at TurboGrafx 16. If we're talking CPU bits, it only has 8, but claims to be 16 bit graphics.<br /><br />Apparently, it's able to display more than 256 colors at once, but only 482...that can fit in 9 bits. If it's &quot;colors at once&quot; then technically NES can only do (without tricks) 25 colors at once, which fits in 5 bits.<br /><br />NES is really 5 bit graphics.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Game Boy Color has eight 4-color background palettes and eight 3-color sprite palettes, and these are practical to rewrite during horizontal blanking. Each color is 15-bit, just like on Super NES.<br /><br />Perhaps &quot;8-bit game graphics&quot; means 1-chip VDCs that were common at the same time as 8-bit CPUs in game consoles. Or it could mean graphics that don't require reading more than 8 bits per pixel across all of tilemap, background tile data, and sprite tile data. NES and Game Boy fetch patterns read about 4 bits per pixel; Master System reads about 8.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />It's hard to talk about what the CGA was really capable of.<br /><br />In early games, it almost always used artifact colors, because no-one would spring for a digital monitor. So the resolution was very approximately 16 color and very approximately 320 pixels wide. In practice, because NTSC, every 2 (nominal 320 source pixels) or 4 (nominal 640 source pixels) pixel wide group of pixels would specify its own color.<br /><br />It later games, almost everyone was using EGA or VGA cards and monitors with legacy compatibility, and so CGA support was your choice of one of six ugly 4 color palettes, not all of which were widely used.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I think it means graphics matching those of the consoles that belonged in the 8-bit category in the console wars era (sega vs nintendo). Forget technical aspects, this is a cultural discussion. The consoles that were known as 8-bit were mainly the NES and the Sega Master System. So 8-bit graphics are graphics that look like (or at least how people remember them to be) the graphics in those console's games.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Yeah, “8-bit” in layman’s terms is a bit of a misnomer. People knew the NES was an 8-bit console, but not fully understanding what that meant, assumed it had to do with the graphics, since as the consumer that’s reall all you’re supposed to know about. It wasn’t until I actually learned what bits were and what color depth was, that I started to make the connection. Though before I got involved in NES development I just assumed the NES had a 256 color palette. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />For me, 8-bit equates to 256 colors, like mode 13h on DOS. You can’t really change the way people talk, though. It just kinda is what it is.

If you disagree, awesome!  If you agree, awesome!)</li><li>Find &quot;holes&quot; in my classification system (again: do not care)</li><li>Mention popular systems I'm not familiar with (esp. European systems) (read: I'm not ashamed that I lack familiarity with every computer/console in the history of mankind -- I don't have the time or interest to go trying out everything under the sun just to find out if it falls into this classification or not)</li><li>Mention incredibly obscure systems (like weird bar/pub poker games, weird shit from Hong Kong, etc.)</li></ul><br />There is a (pun intended) somewhat blurry line in this type of classification.  For example, I consider these to be valid 8-bit graphical games which happen to be arcade ports: Contra (NES; fairly close to the arcade), Bionic Commando (NES; totally different than the arcade), Jackal (NES; fairly close to the arcade), Castlevania (essentially a port of Haunted Castle (arcade)), Space Harrier (SMS; similar to arcade), etc..  I've seen some arcade ports to the Apple II, for example, that I guess would fall under 8-bit graphics, but the ports are really terrible and almost shameful (read: nobody is mimicking this aesthetic; I could say the same of Ikari Warriors NES).  It shouldn't come as a surprise that some of the more blurry allowances are all games made by companies who did both home console games *and* arcade games (Konami, Capcom, Sega, etc.).<br /><br />Likewise, I will mention that it's very hard to remind myself of these limitations due to... well... age and timing.  For example: Black Tiger is a System 16 arcade game (PPU is 320x224 with 15-bit colour, w/ 4096 to 6144 colours on-screen total; CPU is 68K; APU is Z80) that came out in 1987 -- so around the time I got my NES.  As such, my brain really wants to classify it as &quot;an 8-bit graphical game&quot;, even though nearly everything about the system is 16-bit.  Sometimes I slip and will say &quot;oh yeah, that's a totally 8-bit game&quot;, even though it isn't.<br /><br />Shovel Knight, BTW, does not fall under the &quot;blurry line&quot; classification: it could be ported to the NES but with some definite decreases in visual quality/experience.  Just because Kaufman composed it in Famitracker w/ VRC6 doesn't mean it fits into the 8-bit graphics category -- sorry.<br /><br /><sup>[1]</sup> -- This one is is a toughie for me given the extremes Brian went to in attempt to adhere to NES limitations, but in the end couldn't.  It deserves special mention though.<br /><sup>[2]</sup> -- There are some areas/parts that adhere to the classification, but overall the game does not (it's definitely one to be classified as 16-bit, e.g. SNES-like).

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />For me, it's basically whatever you can do on a computer that happens to have an 8-bit data bus. TG16 is my grayzone, mostly based on feelings and associations. <br /><br />It kind of makes me cringe a bit when someone is using &quot;8 bit art&quot; to describe anything they've done that happens to be low resolution, low colour depth, or something that simply looks a bit 80/90s gamey. But i guess the point is that the piece is meant to be &quot;in the likeness of 8-bit aesthetics&quot;, which is still sort of true. It's just that not enough seem to actually care about the certain degree of likeness as long as it draws on associations of something that feels &quot;retro&quot;. I'd prefer to just call it pixel art or computer revisionism, depending on (not all pixel art draws on nostalgia).<br /><br />re: text/ascii art based games.  Yeah, for me text based adventures etc are very much part of the 8-bit experience as (most?) systems of the time weren't really up for the task of action games the way SMS or NES were. I'd much rather play a text adventure than Q*bert on the VIC-20, and that was still a game-centered computer. So many games (most forgotten by now) relied on text based input/output; not just the adventures. Things like moon lander simulators, tactical troop deployment games, etc etc.

If Shovel Knight doesn't qualify into the common misnomer of &quot;8-bit graphics&quot; used with modern indie games, then <strong><em>no</em></strong> games do.<br /><br />For contrast, see aforementioned Curse of the Moon which definitely calls back to a bunch of NES aesthetics (especially in terms of it color use), but breaks them whenever it feels like it just doesn't bother, which is almost constantly, and as a result doesn't really feel close to as much as an NES experience as Shovel Knight does.
