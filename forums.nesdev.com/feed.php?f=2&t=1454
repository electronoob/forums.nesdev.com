The latest Nestopia with the NTSC filter enabled emulates this if you have your monitor set to 60 Hz and field merging off. Compare Battletoads during game play (not the cutscenes) with another game. You should see a faint pattern moving up the screen in Battletoads.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"><br />I still don't understand the logic behind that flag [sprite overflow].

Yes, it'd be unreliable for end-of-screen events. Sprite #0 hit would be necessary.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"><br />I heard that getting the time right with DMC IRQ's is pretty hard.

The DMC IRQ occurs at approximately the right place (and always a few scanlines early), then you constantly poll $2002 until the sprite #0 hit flag is raised.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"><br />I think I heard that to use DMC IRQ's you'd need large ammounts of data... is that right?<br /></div><br /><br />In the NES book viewers discussed recently, I only needed a 17-byte DMC sample (of all zero to make it silent), which I restarted at NMI every frame. Once the last byte is read, the IRQ occurs. Adjusting the DMC timing is a matter of setting the DMC pitch in $4010. To calibrate it you just have it enable something like color emphasis so you can see where it's occurring on scren, then try each pitch. I'll post some code if you want to try this.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=17">blargg</a> — Sun Apr 30, 2006 8:23 pm</p><hr />

I'm thinking about the best way to reduce the number of displayed scanlines to get a little more Vblank time.<br /><br />I'm on a mapper with no IRQ's, meaning it is hard to turn the screen off early, as I'd have to force a sprite 0 hit (draw garbage on the background) and make sure the game logic does not go beyond the hit point or it'd be all screwed up.<br /><br />Maybe I could turn the screen on a few scanlines late... but I remembered of an issue with the scanline that is 1 cycle shorter, that it isn't shorter when the screen is off, isn't it? Would that cause any problems?<br /><br />I just want some new perspective on this. Thanks for the help.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=95">tokumaru</a> — Sun Apr 30, 2006 11:58 am</p><hr />
