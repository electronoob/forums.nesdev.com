		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Hi!<br /><br />First of all, thanks everyone for the advice. I'm not going to reply to everyone but i did read the whole thing. I managed to make the whole thing work, the code is somewhat elegant, i think.<br /><br />One thing I would recommend anyone doing that kind of thing is to take a few hours to create yourself a little reference implementation in a language that is a bit more expressive/flexible than ASM. I made myself a little C# control that behaves exactly like a PPU and and can show me which tiles/attributes are updated (red = tile, yellow = attribute). It allowed me to figure out what my algorithm was going to be and then I simply translated it in ASM. And when I had bugs in the ASM, I could simply compare and figure out where things went wrong. See attached image. If mesen could do this, it would be awesome.<br /><br />One last problem I have is that in extreme conditions, like when going diagonally and being perfectly aligned in X and Y, and being on a frame where a full row and column of tiles AND attribute will load in, i will exceed the NMI cpu cycle limit by about ~400 cycles. <br /><br />Since I am going to blank the top/bottom 16 scanlines, would it be possible to offload some of the PPU update work there? Like update the palettes there or part of the tiles/attributes? How common is this as a technique? <br /><br />(I am also aware I could simply change my algorithm to, for example, just process 1 row or column per frame, but im too lazy to change that right now). <br /><br />-Mat

(uses column mode)</li></ul><br />This means, in the absolute worst case, you have to write new address to $2006 8 times, and write 78 bytes of data to $2007. Assuming 4 cycles for load and 4 cycles for writing to the register, that's 8*(4+4+4+4) + 78*(4+4) = 752 cycles. Of course more cycles are needed for logic, etc... but this should be doable in VBlank without using any further tricks.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">Since I am going to blank the top/bottom 16 scanlines, would it be possible to offload some of the PPU update work there? Like update the palettes there or part of the tiles/attributes? How common is this as a technique? </div><br />This technique is uncommon, but was made probably popular by the game Battletoads (and it's sequel Battletoads and Double Dragon) which are very popular among NESDevers. Personally unless I'd <em>really</em> need the extra blanking time, I'd rather hide them using either a blank CHR-ROM bank or by disabling the background only and having 8 high priority sprites at Y=0 hiding the real sprites, avoiding Battletoads-style forced blanking on the top of the screen and all the problems this creates.<br /><br />Also: if you aim at great scrolling you should hide the top scanlines, not the bottom, because sprites can't be shown partially on the screen on the top of the screen, but they can on the bottom. Also turning sprites rendering off during the frame can cause erratic problems.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />If you turn rendering off at the top of the screen, as opposed to using blank tiles like Jurassic Park does, you can indeed use that time to keep accessing VRAM, but there are a couple of catches: Firstly, the NTSC dot crawl pattern will be different, because the variable PPU cycle at the beginning of the frame doesn't happen when rendering is off; Secondly, you don't get to use the MMC3 scanline counter to time the blanking area anymore, because it doesn't work when rendering is off. Sprite 0 hits are also not an option.<br /><br />If you can deal with the slightly different appearance of the image (IIRC, Battletoads is like this, for example), and you have an alternate way to time the blanking area, then yeah, you can get quite a bit of extra vblank time.

My engine can do both a column and a row of metatiles (i.e. 132 tiles) plus their attributes, along with a sprite DMA. I use completely unrolled code (i.e. no index increments or branches, which saves a lot of time) to barely fit this all in standard vblank time, and other types of updates (palettes, patterns, etc.) can only be done when the scrolling isn't taking all the time, but that's OK, because no game will ever scroll diagonally at 16 pixels per frame every frame, so there are plenty of opportunities for other types of updates. <br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">Kasumi wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">You can also use the stack instead of a zero page buffer.</div><br />The stack is slower, though. That being said, I do find it a bit difficult to take advantage of ZP's faster load time. If you use indexing, the speed advantage is gone (takes the same time as absolute indexed or PLA, which's 4 cycles), so you need unrolled code to load from constant memory locations, but since 8-way scrolling means that rows and columns are nearly always split across 2 name tables, that's not trivial. It can be done, but you have to be clever.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />It's a good thing I'm not particularly fond of Chemical Plant Zone so I wouldn't want to design a level like it anyway. Still, full speed on both axes is way too fast, so if at least one of the axis is slightly slower than 16 pixels per frame, maybe 14 or so, there'll still be some opportunities for other types of updates.<br /><br />Another thing that prevents this from being a huge problem is that when the screen is scrolling that fast, the lack of other updates is much harder for the human eye to notice, and if someone does notice, they'll slow to look at it and things will immediately go back to normal, and there'll be nothing to see! <img src="./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=":wink:" title="Wink" />
