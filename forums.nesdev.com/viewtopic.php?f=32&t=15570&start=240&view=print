		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />So I tested the gift message action53 rom on a number of different consoles and found that the problem only exists on the original NES.<br /><br />Two different NTSC front loaders, and a PAL front loader exhibited the issue.<br /><br />RetroUSB AVS, Hyperkin FCmobile2, &amp; RetroDuo portable all worked fine after reset.<br /><br />Testing the mapper28 test I assume that I can effectively test the reset condition multiple times repeatedly very quickly by simply pressing reset over and over again?  The rom seems to report the status of the most recent reset.<br /><br />I found that the reset test always seemed to pass with AVS &amp; FCmobile.  With the retroduo it usually passed, if I hit reset enough times eventually it would fail and then get stuck in that condition failling forever afterwards.<br /><br />With the original NES the reset test passes about half the time.  Interestingly if I keep pressing reset it will go back to passing condition sometimes.  It'll toggle between pass/fail over and over again never getting stuck in one state.  But it's not like it toggles each reset.  It fails a few times, then passes a few times in streaks of 1-5 tests or so..<br /><br />Don't think it matters much as it's not a problem with the action53 rom, but the power up test fails sometimes.  With the FCmobile it's the worst, sometimes I have to power cycle it quickly to get it to pass power up.  The AVS failed the first power up test, but then passed every time afterwards.  Retroduo seems to always pass.  The NES typically passes, but if the power wasn't left off for long enough it'll fail typically.  I'm guessing this is all due to startup sequence of the CPLD and whether or not it fully shuts down.  Either way power up isn't an issue with the current action53 build.<br /><br />So with all this my conclusion is that it's probably not a software issue.  I was starting to doubt that anyway considering when I first found the issue it didn't fail 100% of the time.  My best guess is the execution of the 6502 through a reset on the original NES isn't that 'clean'.  Maybe if the CPU is in a write cycle during reset, it gets erroneously decoded as a write to the mapper register and corrupts the mapper state.  Still doesn't explain why I've only seen the issue with certain games within a53, but none of this is consistent anyway..<br /><br />I've got some ideas of how I might be able to filter things from the CPLD that I'm going to give a try over the weekend.  I'm considering doing things such as fully decoding the CPU address for writes to the $5000 register.  Or maybe block register writes if CPU A0 and/or M2 isn't toggling regularly.  I seemed to have some issues with my flash write allow register getting corrupted when flashing the cart as well.  Now that I'm writing this, perhaps it's all related to the same problem.  So I'm also thinking I'll just go through my verilog to see if there's anything I can find that stands out as a potential issue or I want to rewrite the whole thing.  It was forever ago when I wrote that and wasn't as experienced as now..  <br /><br />In the end I don't feel this is a big enough of issue to delay the release further.  If anyone disagrees and considers this bug more significant please chime in.<br /><br />I've got time set aside to start builds after tax day next Tuesday, so whatever the state of things is at that point I'm planning to move forward at that point.  <br /><br />The biggest thing I need right now is the email list of contributors so I can blast everyone asking for their shipping address and desired cart form 60/72pin.  I don't want to release the public sale until those have been shipped out to contributors.  But I've got ~200 carts to assemble to keep me busy while we're hunting down contributor info.  I'm doing what I can to push and get contributor carts out and the public release by the end of April.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Cartridges are assembled, and I'm trying to push the release out by the end of this week if possible.  Before the release I want to make an effort to get contributor carts out first.  So I'm blasting the contributors right now to get their mailing addresses &amp; desired gift messages.  I'm pointing them here to discuss finer details of the gift message if needed.  <br /><br />What are the required specs?  I see there's 2 lines total, but I'm guessing the length isn't a fixed character count as the text is variable width again.  Based on the demo message looks like it's somewhere around 27 characters per line, with 2 lines total?  <br /><br />If the contributor doesn't want to use 2 full lines, I'm thinking a standard first line of something like &quot;Contributor Edition&quot;  for the first line, with their name/message on the second.  Anyone have a better less boring suggestion?<br /><br /><br />EDIT:  I just blasted all contributors I had record of via email.  So if you had an entry to the 2016 compo, or contributed to Action53 vol3 in anyway and didn't get my email let me know.  emailing <!-- e --><a href="mailto:paul@infiniteneslives.com">paul@infiniteneslives.com</a><!-- e --> is best.

The difference would be on the title screen where the contributor editions will say something like &quot;Contributor Edition  &lt;contributor's name/handle/message&gt;&quot;.  The publicly available 100x Limited Editions will say &quot;Limited Edition 1 of 100&quot; type thing.  I haven't slapped the Caution stickers on the back of the carts yet, so if we wanted to come up with a different Caution label to physically distinguish them.<br /><br />The regular edition NES carts will be grey, and all the famicom carts will be yellow.
