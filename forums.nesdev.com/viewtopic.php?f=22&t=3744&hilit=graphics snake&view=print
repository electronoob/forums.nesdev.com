<br />
<br />i don't have a chip programmer so if someone could test it on actual hardware i would greatly appreciate it (mmc1).
<br />

<br />I just expected the vines to be a bit thicker, they are too thin, don't you think? I kinda feel that the movement could be smoother, but I really don't remember how it was in the original game.
<br />
<br />Anyway, I'm glad you made such a good homebrew. Good work!

<br />
<br />I actually haven't played Pitfall in over 20 years, so I don't know the rules.  Are you actually penalized 500 points every time you pause the game (&amp; see the "map"?)
<br />
<br />Good luck with the game (and any additions to the traps/enemies/<span class="posthilit">graphics</span>, hint, hint...)

<br />
<br />I ported an Activision 2600 game also, a while back, Freeway.  It worked though I never got the car patterns done right.
<br />
<br />I worked on an NES cover of the Pitfall 2 theme a long time ago, if that'd be any use to you let me know and I could remake/finish it.  Though I guess that'd be kinda weird since the first one was pretty quiet.  Credit, title screen or custom game music maybe.
<br />
<br />ccovell: The original didn't have a map.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Some criticism:
<br />The game mechanics are WAY off.
<br />* In the original, jumping did not allow you to change direction in midair.  This messes up the common technique of jumping, then immediately letting go of the Right direction to ensure that the guy stops immediately after the jump.
<br />* It's very hard to grab the vines.  This is because the vines movement is way off, the vines are supposed to move smoothly in a pattern, which takes a significant amount of time for the vines to stop and change direction.  Here they change direction far too fast.
<br />
<br />Additionally, the game is not smooth enough.  The original game allowed you to move 1 horizontal doublepixel every two frames.
<br />
<br />There's also a disassembly of Pitfall floating around, I'm sure that using it directly would be flagrant copyright infringement.

<br />
<br />I was just going to mention that NES <span class="posthilit">Snake</span> 2 is up there. I haven't played too much of Solar Wars. I love the sound in NES <span class="posthilit">Snake</span> 2.
<br />
<br />But this I think is a great remake! The game handles a lot better than the original (Maybe since I'm not using a really annoying joystick). I hope you're planning to put sound in. This would be a much more enjoyable experience with music.

<br />Movement seems jerky (20 FPS?). I'd expect that the original ran at 60 FPS, but I may be wrong. Also, my emulator reported a possible sprite DMA while the PPU was active, but maybe it's not the case. Does it work on hardware?

<br />The original never had music just sounds that could be emulated thru raw PCM

<br />
<br />I didn't think that the challenge of the original came from the crappy controls. And besides, if the game is now completely easy because the controls aren't complete crap, someone needs to rethink the challenge factor of their game. I personally enjoy Pitfall. If the only reason the game was challenging was due to the dumb joystick, I probably wouldn't play it.

<br />
<br />But the VCS code is so far removed from how it'd be done on NES, it'd be pretty much unusable and incomprehensible without knowing how the TIA chip does it's thing.
