<br />
<br />Anyway, it was fun to meet someone else who like the NES so much, 'cause you really can't find many people here who do.
<br />
<br />We managed to talk a little about the NES over lunch. I wasn't feeling very well that day, things at work were pretty heavy and I was going to have laser eye surgery the next day, so I was a bit nervous already. So this lunch was the most pleasant part of the day!
<br />
<br />I also think it is aways nice to see the faces of the people we talk to in here almost every day, and you realize they're also people, not just nicknames with avatars. =)
<br />
<br />I thank you very much for the games again, No Carrier. They provided me hours of entertainment when I was stuck at home for not beeing able to see very well!

On the real word, you'll rather act agressive with someone who has a ugly face but on the internet, you'll rather be agressive with someone with a ugly avatar or an ugly nickname , lol.
<br />
<br />I don't think any people here have the occasion to meet, but I don't think that is really bad. Anyway I'd be able to speak to noone, because noone know french, and I really suck at oral english.
<br />
<br />Tokumaru, you complain that nobody seem to like the NES exept us ? A lot of people like the NES I think, but not too many really take it seriously. Most people who knowns the NES just like to play it sometimes when it remembers them the old times or something. To me it is just a system like the other, with good games. I don't care if a game is old or new, to me it is the same.

But I guess it's mostly off-topic in this thread because people rarely come here internationally except to see the Indy 500 and F1.  No chip music tours or nothing, even though I'll claim Indianapolis is the "Home of the NSF file format", heheh.
<br />
<br />Just imagine the concentration of cool NES hardware, if we could get kev's console, Squeedo, CopyNES, MidiNES (both versions), FunkyFlashCart (if I ever rework my botched USB chip mounting) all hooked up in the same room.  NES hacking overload. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />
<br />
<br />Maybe some people would be up for it.

The closest someone here lives to me, I can't remember his name, he's newer, and he lives in Moose Lake. I thought that was kinda cool. But yeah, like a NESdev event would be sweet, and I'd love to go to one. Like an E3 type thing where they talk about new stuff happening with people's games would be sweet, and I'd definitely try to go. Although, I doubt something like that would happen, I'm just saying it'd be sweet.
<br />
<br />It's funny, because you imagine the people browsing these forums so differently than they actually look. I think it's funny that I actually pictured Tokumaru as Knuckles, hahahaha. I keep imagining that I'm actually talking to Knuckles. It's quite humorous.

<br />
<br />Yeah though, I think it'd be sweet to have a NES party. It'd be wierd, because we all seem to act like we're around the same age, but you never know! People here seem to be around like 20ish, and if there was a party, there'd probably be alcohol, and there'd be people who aren't 21 yet, and it'd be illegal, and people would be mad, and that'd be bad! I myself am not 21 yet (Something you all might have known, but if you didn't, you do now!), so I'd feel kind of like I'm 12 or something (I'm older than that) if there were people having alcohol.
<br />
<br />I don't know really what to expect of NESdevers in the real world. I don't know if most of us are huge party people, addicted to marijuana, or what. I'm not corrupted or anything, I don't have an alcohol or drug addiction. I could probably have fun at an event like a NESdev party thing. As long as I don't get beat up and thrown out a window, haha.
<br />
<br />EDIT: 
<br />Bregalad, you say you aren't very good at oral english. You are pretty good at written english, so you should probably practice oral english. Does it take you a long time to read or write something in english? Can you understand oral english? I'm sorry, I find language learning interesting, and I'd just like to see how english is difficult to learn as a secondary language. I'm learning japanese, and I can play a game like Final Fantasy VI, and I can find something in each text bubble that will indicate the subject of the text. I can understand barely any oral japanese, and I can barely speak it. But the only way to get better is to practice, maybe throw yourself at the language as much as possible. I watch animes in japanese so I'll get better at listening for common phrases and stuff. 
<br />
<br />You seem to have a good range of vocabulary. If you know the rules of english reading, it'll be alot easier to say words, or hear them. Maybe trying to read your posts out loud would help. Just a suggestion...
<br />
<br />It's a little way off topic, but I was just interested.

<br />I sure hope so. Anyway, I <em>really</em> hate parties. Please don't ask me why.
<br />
<br />BTW whathever is happening I don't think I'll ever travel to america, at least not alone. I don't like travelling too much, but if you actually can see friends in your vacation place this could still be interesting.
<br />Also, travel by plane is expensive and incredibly boring exept when you're just setting off or landing.
<br />I'd definitely go nowhere unless several parents/friends/cousins/whatever come with me, and I doubt anyone cares about a NESdev internationnal reunion. I really cannot imagine how boring it would be to travel alone, to meet people you won't be able to talk with.
<br />
<br />Celius : I went to Ireland last year (with my parents) and I wasn't able to hear a word of what people say unless they repeat it 4 or 5 times. This makes me in big trouble to try to talk to people, because it makes me wonder how stupid I'll sound and then it turns me not actually trying my english.
<br />I think the less horible oral english is in England, where people speaks "correctly" as opposed to Irish, Americans and Australians, who speaks like aliens. But I still have trouble to understand good old British people.
<br />English isn't too hard to learn. The fact that you MUST know english to play most good games helps. Maybe the same thing happen with japanese, actually, but I know nothing about japanseese language.
<br />
<br />Oh and also I remember not liking you too much back then when you had that dumb worm avater (well, I foud it dumb even if you probably don't agree). When you switched to the Clad avatar, I immediately liked you a lot more, hehe.

<br />It's not that nobody likes the NES, there are people that remember playing those games as kids so they still like them. However, many people will just say that the games look bad. I think that good games are good forever. If a game was good 20 years ago, there is no new game that will make that old game seem bad today.
<br />
<br />Anyway, even if there are a few gamers that still enjoy the NES, almost noone is interested in how those games work. So you may find people that like the games, but don't give a shit about the architecture, wich is what we find fascinating here. So that is the same as nothing for me. I know there are a few other brazillian guys in these boards, but they're mainly interested in emulator programming, not game programming, wich is what I like best. Interest in emulator coding is also pretty rare, so I think that's cool.
<br />
<br />People these days don't want to know about the inner workings of computers. Programming languages are more and more abstract every day, and that's all people care about now. And most programmers I know don't have clue on how to code a game. They simply know the basic form stuff, database stuff... those boring thinks, that have no room for actual logic, they just use a couple of IF's here and there. I find that very sad. Programming used to be so fun and challenging.
<br />
<br />Enough rant. NESDEV meetings would be nice. Many other platforms have meetings everywhere around the globe (such as the MSX, those guys have tons of meetings across Europe, and there is even one here in Rio). These have more adepts than the NES though, so maybe there is no point in arranging NES meetings for 4 or 5 people! =)
<br />
<br />I guess we could take a look at the demographic distribution of NESDEV members (you had those, didn't you Memblers?) to look for possible places that could hold meetings. If those were advertised here, maybe a good number of people would show up for each meeting.

I prefer not speak about that, but you see what I mean. I actually feel like programming nothing, just being a robot doing what people tell to do and if you ask questions to yourself or disagree with whathever you're a shit.
<br />And I'll very probably not meet anyone, but this is kind of cool, because in the whole 6 bilion of people on the planet, you can speak with the few that has the exact same interest as you regardless of where they're born, wich isn't the case in the real world.
<br />Internet is almost like if everyone would have no body and if we'd live in a world where life is eternal and where you can communicate with anyone if you wish. Almost, of course. This is kind of cool. In the real world, you're mostly forced to meet with people you don't like or with people that are kind, but just aren't very interesting.
