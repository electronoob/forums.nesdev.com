I mean the game looks and sound ugly and is terrible to control and it's impossible to not get lost if you don't map the game. Even if you do, when you loose, you'll be back in an almost dead state. So the option is to not die, but it's obviously incredibly hard.<br />Super Metroid was WAAAY better thanks god. I'm not a fan either, but at least they managed to make a decent game. That said, everyone is free to like the game they want to, I just cannot understand how someone may like games as bad as the original Metroid, but it seems many people can. On the other hand, many people don't see how I can like 2D games better than 3D ones, and why I like only RPGs, while many people found them boring.<br /><br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">For example on the DS GBA A should be the actual B button and B should be Y, The same goes for the “classic” remote witch is only half good for SNES games </div><br />Is the DS control deck like the SNES one, but they still map A button to A and B button to B ?

<br />Yes Castlevania isn't too hard until you meet with the Death. Then it suddentely become absolutely impossible unless you have the bomb weapon, which for some reason is unacessible in this area, so if you did lost your bomb or if you fail one you're screwed and have to restart all over again.
<br />Simon's Quest can be the easiest game of all time if you have a walktrough  (or if you have had one), or the hardest if you don't have any and try to make sense of the NPC's messages.
<br />Dracula's Curse is just fine in difficulty unless you reach some of the latter stages, then it becomes incredibly hard (especially in the non-japanese verison, where you have to do the last stage all over again on each loss against Dracula, I don't know how people managed to pass this without savestates !)
<br />BTW SCV4 is a lot easier than everything else until one particular stage (8), then is becomes HARD ! I often don't loose a single live (or only one or two) until stage 7.
<br />
<br />PS : How could that fatty plumber win against the great Magus on <a href="http://www.gamefaqs.com/poll/index.html?poll=2900" class="postlink">GameFaqs</a> ? It's not possible, someone SHOULD have passed his day to send polls for him using a thousand of different IP adresses. He should be banned to the character conquest, he's number one each years anyway, even worse than Brazil in soccer (sarcasm).

<br />In the NES and GBA, A and B are buttons 0 and 1. In the Super NES, B and Y are buttons 0 and 1, and A and X are buttons 8 and 9. In the DS, A and B are buttons 0 and 1, and X and Y are buttons 16 and 17.

<br />
<br />because you are searching for "Super Mario Forever IIRC" when you should be searching for "Super Mario Forever."  IIRC means "If I recall correctly." 
<br />
<br />
<br />As for the GBA-&gt;DS stuff, probably the #1 reason A is mapped to A and B is mapped to B regardless of pure hardware reasons (as posted above) is the sheer fact that consumers would be confused if they just mapped the buttons to B and Y instead.  Imagine a kid with a DS trying to play a GBA game and being instructed by the game to "push A" and him mashing it furiously and wondering why it isn't working, to then proclaim his DS "broken" and his parents want to exchange it because they don't know any better, leading Nintendo to have to deal with tons of perfectly fine returned DS units.  Now I think you can see why A is mapped to A and B to B.  I bet people get on forums all the time over the Yobo FC twin because you use the B and Y buttons to play the NES games and idiots don't pay attention (since I'm sure it says on the box somewhere).
<br />
<br />As for hard games, most of the games on the NES are hard solely because they are unfair one way or another.  Yo Noid! is actually quite easy but if you get touched once you have to start the level over, making it difficult until you master the level.  Contra is hard because you have to kill bad guy upon bad guy and are only allowed a couple hits and its game over.  Almost all NES games are either really easy or really hard, I have found very few that strike a genuine balance between the two.

<br />that is absolutely ridiculous, the only way that is conceivably possible is if he memorized the generation order of all of the blocks and then determined the optimized way to fit them together for the maximum amount of tetrises (tetri?).

<br />
<br />while all of that definitely makes a big difference (and why comparing results from one version of tetris to another is obviously a moot point) thats still one impressively quick response time.  He must play purely by looking at his pieces coming up and just looking at the actual stack out of the corner of his eye.

<br />
<br />After playing lots of "Rush N Attack," Contra is starting to seem like a walk in the park.  After all, its almost the same game just contra you get a gun (and some badass ones at that) and Rush N Attack you are expected to take down an entire army with a freakin knife.  Mega Man 2 isn't SUPER easy, especially if you don't know which weapon to use against what boss/enemy.  If you are refering to difficulty in terms of "Game Over," Mega Man 2 is cake since you can continue infinitely and start with like 3 lives and a long power bar.  Although, I think most NES games should let you have inifinite continues, why should you have to replay the same levels again just to get 2 steps farther and die again?

<br />Why would you loose 3 lives while playing Mega Man ? You'll gain so many lives before loosing the original 3 that if you get game over you really isn't good (exept if you're playing for the first time of course). Yes. a few bosses if you use the wrong weapon (Crashman and Heatman comes in mind) can be a pain. But compared to other NES games of the same time area, Mega Man 2 is incredibly easier than anything else that comes up (it's still a great game neverthless). Also there is a place where you are forced to loose a live, but does it make the game hard ?
<br />And yes, I have unlimited continues (or at least severly limited continues). On the other hand, games where you are just continuing the quest no matter how many times you die like Wizard and Warriors tends to be a bit bland, as it doesn't matter how much you get hurt.
