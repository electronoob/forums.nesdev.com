Now we have no idea how well it will sell (honestly I'm not really worried, but arguments have been made that the scene is getting slightly saturated). I think we are sitting pretty good with funds, but Paul might be able to clear this up for us.<br /></div><br /><br />We've got a <a href="https://forums.nesdev.com/viewtopic.php?f=22&amp;t=14015#p196999" class="postlink">sizable balance</a> built up of $3.3k right now.  This is more than enough to cover printed materials and contributor cartridges for vol3.  My poll of CIB boxes of traditional cardboard vs. bitboxes on both <a href="https://forums.nesdev.com/viewtopic.php?f=32&amp;t=16006" class="postlink">nesdev</a> and <a href="http://nintendoage.com/forum/messageview.cfm?catid=22&amp;threadid=174286" class="postlink">NA</a>, results show a favor towards traditioinal boxes.  To help offset the investment of traditional boxes I'm planning to make a number of limited edition cartridges available to the general public.  That will help us recover the printed material costs rather quickly compared to 2 years later like we had with vol 2.<br /><br />In short, our finances are very healthy.  I see no issues in awarding prize money immediately as winners are announced just as we did last compo.  If anything we have a surplus of funds, that we can afford to utilize for anything we see fit.  Larger/more prizes in the form of cash or physical goods.  Web hosting fees, etc.<br /><br />I've heard some people make similar comments about the market being saturated, or on the decline.  From my perspective I see absolutely no evidence of this, all things I see argue the opposite.  The homebrew community, and sales are stronger than they have ever been, and continue to grow.  Applying the word saturation to the homebrew market doesn't even make sense to me honestly.  But I haven't heard the arguements either.<br /><br />My only guess as to where the sense that the market is saturated is when looking at limited edition NA homebrew auctions.  When developers first started offering these auctions collectors went wild and emptied their pockets in the excitement.  With growing popularity and frequency of those types of auctions, collectors started to get more realistic with how much money they're able to spend on LE auctions.  I view that as an over reaction initially, which didn't take long to settle down to the reasonable level it is now.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=4832">infiniteneslives</a> — Sat Jun 03, 2017 1:02 pm</p><hr />

Sorry guys, didn't mean to leave everyone hanging... Real life is busy, who has time for hobbies? <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />I've made a tentative updated guide for 2017 <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/viewtopic.php?f=33&amp;t=16019" class="postlink">here</a>.  Once we get this finalized, I will cross-post on Nintendoage.  Does anyone else have any recommendations where we should post this?<br /><br />This thought just came to me now, but I'd love to do some kind of collab with the NSF scene and include a jukebox on the cartridge. Thoughts?  This might also be a good way for artists to offer up music services for people who don't have time to write their own, or don't have the music skills.<br /><br />Another thing I had in mind was how the prize money worked last year.  Previously, the cartridge was already released before we decided on prize money.  Now we have no idea how well it will sell (honestly I'm not really worried, but arguments have been made that the scene is getting slightly saturated). I think we are sitting pretty good with funds, but Paul might be able to clear this up for us.<br /><br />The only other suggestion I had off-hand was if someone who is very familiar with the Multicart mapper would be willing to put together a well commented/documented template for an absolute beginner (which maybe other volunteers could convert to different assemblers).  Essentially just a little shove in the right direction to get a beginner using the best practices for inclusion on the multicart.<br /><br />*edit:  One more thing! Did anyone have an opinion on giving the competition it's own dedicated domain? I'd like to avoid any animosity between the different forums and demographics.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=4091">NESHomebrew</a> — Fri Jun 02, 2017 11:26 pm</p><hr />

May include violence where a character is unharmed after the action has been inflicted<br />Fantasy Violence - Violent actions of a fantasy nature, involving human or non-human characters in situations easily distinguishable from real life<br />Violent References - References to violent acts<br />Violence - Scenes involving aggressive conflict. May contain bloodless dismemberment<br />Intense Violence - Graphic and realistic-looking depictions of physical conflict. May involve extreme and/or realistic blood, gore, weapons and depictions of human injury and death<br /><br /><strong>Language</strong><br />Lyrics - Mild references to profanity, sexuality, violence, alcohol or drug use in music<br />Strong Lyrics - Explicit and/or frequent references to profanity, sex, violence, alcohol or drug use in music<br />Language - Mild to moderate use of profanity<br />Strong Language - Explicit and/or frequent use of profanity<br /><br /><strong>Humor</strong><br />Comic Mischief - Depictions or dialogue involving slapstick or suggestive humor<br />Crude Humor - Depictions or dialogue involving vulgar antics, including &quot;bathroom&quot; humor<br />Mature Humor - Depictions or dialogue involving &quot;adult&quot; humor, including sexual references<br /><br /><strong>Nudity</strong><br />Partial Nudity - Brief and/or mild depictions of nudity<br />Nudity - Graphic or prolonged depictions of nudity<br /><br /><strong>Sexuality</strong><br />Suggestive Themes - Mild provocative references or materials<br />Sexual Themes - References to sex or sexuality<br />Sexual Content - Non-explicit depictions of sexual behavior, possibly including partial nudity<br />Sexual Violence - Depictions of rape or other violent sexual acts<br />Strong Sexual Content - Explicit and/or frequent depictions of sexual behavior, possibly including nudity<br /><br /><strong>Gambling</strong><br />Simulated Gambling - Player can gamble without betting or wagering real cash or currency<br />Real Gambling - Player can gamble, including betting or wagering real cash or currency<br /><br /><strong>Substances</strong><br />Tobacco Reference - Reference to and/or images of tobacco products<br />Use of Tobacco - The consumption of tobacco products<br /><br />Alcohol Reference - Reference to and/or images of alcoholic beverages<br />Use of Alcohol - The consumption of alcoholic beverages<br /><br />Drug Reference - Reference to and/or images of illegal drugs<br />Use of Drugs - The consumption or use of illegal drugs<br /></div><br /><br />Some of these have already been clearly outlined in the A53 guidelines (gambling for example), but making a clear call beforehand in each category could help reduce confusion and minimize debate.

Some of the guidelines are stupidly arbitrary at face value (e.g. can you say &quot;fuck&quot; one time, but not two times in a PG-13 movie?).<br /><br />What I think we really need is not so much an attempt to make rules, but a hierarchy of authority so someone can make the subjective call as needed.

That would definitely help. The meaning and extents of &quot;Explicit content&quot; varies greatly from country to country. I think those who have entered in previous compos know what is or isn't acceptable, but, to avoid future problems with newcomers, I'd link to an official set of rules of what's considered &quot;all audiences&quot; in your country, which I think is what you are aiming for when you ask for no &quot;explicit content&quot; to be added if the entrant want his or her work eligible for the multicart <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=6012">na_th_an</a> — Mon May 01, 2017 2:01 pm</p><hr />

Not sure the best way to make this clear, but our definition of explicit is being questioned for last year's compo cart.
