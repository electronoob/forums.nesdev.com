<br />So, Now using Neotoxin Source code! i can make

<br />
<br />Now if only Snowbro (or something) Can give me his tools
<br />
<br />Now if anyone does not know about this, here is what
<br />Snowbro said:
<br />
<br />(Quote: Snowbro)
<br />I have made a number of tools to create levels, encode text, assemble game logic scripts etc., but it takes some effort to package it and document it properly, so I'll hold off releasing it until someone asks.
<br />
<br />If snowbro is still here, i like to see him give me his ''Tools''!
<br />
<br />Thanks

<br />They're currently unusable because of lack of documentation and because everything isn't fine yet.

<br />I trough there already was a try (Rocman X (Unl).nes). Note that they spell Rocman wrong, which is actually Rockman. But it sucked if I remember right.
<br />Isn't Megaman X on SNES just fine ? I prefer the NES megaman games myself.

<br />This is why I want to do this project!
<br />This does NOT feature:
<br />
<br />*Turn blocks turning
<br />
<br />*Coins popping up and down
<br />
<br />*? and Turn Blocks turning into the empty blocks!
<br />
<br />*Info Boxes
<br />
<br />AND:
<br />
<br />*there is NO [!] (Exclamation) blocks
<br />
<br />Did I say that there are no fire flowers!

<br />
<br />No, but you'd be wrong in doing so - the SMW pirate most certainly DOES have fire flowers (though they suck rather horribly).
<br />
<br />If I might make a suggestion, the MMC5 would be a good mapper to use for this game - while the Extended Attribute mode might not be necessary, the ability to have 8KB of (8x16) sprite tiles *and* 4KB of background tiles might prove to be advantageous, not to mention the extra 2 square wave sound channels (which could bring the music several steps closer to sounding authentic). If not the MMC5, then the VRC6 would probably work just as well (except then you'd be using a Konami mapper for a Nintendo game, which is slightly odd).

I feel very very very limited when using someone elses stuff. It doesn't matter when it comes to graphics editors though. But level/music editors, that's something you should do yourself. I'm just wanted to mention that one last time. Please don't hurt me, if you angry at me for saying this like 300 times. I just really stress making EVERYTHING. Just a suggestion. Remember I made it.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I agree 100% with celius. Another point is that is it useless to re-code 100% an existing game exept if you're apporting major changes (and if possible positive changes) to it. Scince nothing changes, anyone will still play the original game and you'll do useless work. However, if you do major change, people that are fan of the original game will be glad to play a variant of it. But Ninendo won't, scince you'll break their copyrights.

<br />Depends. Are you porting the (J) version to the Famicom, or the (U) version to the NES? Remember that only the Famicom brought sound out to the cart edge. But the MMC5 might still be useful, as the extra swappable bank would open up more possibilities for DPCM at $C000.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I'd have to agree with Celius too. I haven't looked at any sources, but... I don't think Neotoxin's structure will match the SMW structure very well. I think you should build everything from the ground. Changing someone else's program is a very hard thing to do if you'll be changing the whole structure. You could GET IDEAS from existing stuff though.
<br />
<br />I'm working on a Sonic kind of game, and I'm designing my level structure/format and engine from the start. When I researched the format used for the original Sonic games I found that most of my ideas matched Sonic Team's ideas (although I had to find some tricky ways to get long levels using very little RAM). Maybe these ideas are just the logical choices for such a game.
<br />
<br />Well, I think building your own engine will give you better control of the project, since you'll not have to live with limitations imposed by someone else. Limitations will exist, and you should live witht he ones that will not cause you much trouble.

<br />
<br />I mean putting the melody and <em>some</em> of the harmony on the base sound channels, and then putting the <em>rest</em> of the harmony on the two MMC5 channels. Without MMC5 it would sound decent, but with MMC5 it would sound really good.
