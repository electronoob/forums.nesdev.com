Thanks for the kind words, folks.<br /><br />HTTP redirections are extremely low-bandwidth and incredibly simple to maintain, so I'm actually going to be extending those until December 2012.  (I'll be updating the Parodius home page momentarily to reflect that)<br /><br />Email redirections are also simple to maintain, but can be high bandwidth depending on what someone sends (e.g. Emailing an ISO image would take up twice the amount of my bandwidth -- once to receive it, and once more to forward it on to another host), and are susceptible to my own DNSBL/RBL rules that I choose to use.<br /><br />The box being used for redirections is <strong>my own personal box</strong>, which means the SMTP server running on there is configured <strong>to my and ONLY MY liking</strong>.  The DNSBL/RBLs I use there are significantly more strict than the ones I use on Parodius presently, simply because the only person using the box <strong>is me</strong> (and that's how I want to keep it).<br /><br />A historic problem I've dealt with for 5-6 years now (at least), with regards to a hosting service (e.g. multi-user systems), is juggling anti-spam tactics.  A solution might solve problems for one user, but induces problems for another.  This has happened 40 or 50 times -- no exaggeration -- and there is very little one can do about it while keeping the KISS principle in mind.  There are ways to solve it, but it involves a lot of resources (basically a single SMTP server/daemon for each user, thus they can control their own DNSBL/RBLs, as well as an instance of SpamAssassin per user) and is extremely annoying/complex to maintain.  So like I said earlier, providing Email services is something I regret ever doing, because it's just a complete and total nightmare.  Plus there are lots of free services (like Gmail) who do a much better job <strong>and</strong> give you a decent amount of control over your spam rules.  Though I personally wouldn't trust storing all of my Email on Google or Microsoft (Hotmail)'s servers, they're still both good services for POP/IMAP where you download your messages periodically and delete them from the server.<br /><br />Both of these things -- HTTP redirections and Email redirections -- still cause me to have to provide some degree of support, which is another part I'd really rather not be doing.  If you ask me "So then why are you?", the answer is: because I'm a nice guy, and I really hate it when I see companies/providers/etc. simply shut down and leave everyone in the dust w/out a care in the world.  Again, morally that just isn't how I operate.<br /><br />Sorry, rambling a bit there, but maybe that gives more insight to some things.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3">koitsu</a> — Sun Jul 29, 2012 12:43 am</p><hr />

If someone really wanted to keep the redirection up that much longer, they'd offer to pay enough to make it worthwhile. Screw the haters and freeloaders, the people who actually matter are grateful that you've ran things this long (and are offering to redirect at all, you could just say "tough shit, I'm going down on X date with no redirects, it's my hosting and I'll do what I want"). That's a sign of character, that you're even willing to extend it as long as you are.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=325">LocalH</a> — Sun Jul 29, 2012 12:22 am</p><hr />

You can't micro-manage the web, Tepples.  Thus, links pointing to old URLs / sites / domains / whatever = too bad.  That's just the way it works.  I say this with respect, not condescension: getting OCD over it isn't worth it.  Besides, if a link doesn't work, people usually resort to a search engine to try and find what they're looking for.  I know if someone mailed me about a link I had on my home page which pointed to something outdated I'd actually be a little creeped out.  And of course I've yet to encounter anyone who has talked to me about my very old, original domain name crystalis.com (I think Neill Corlett may be the only one old enough to remember that).<br /><br />When the site is moved, I can provide Memblers (or whomever else as part of the "staff") full webalizer data which ranges from August 2011 to present (compiled daily, but webalizer stats are organised monthly).  I believe historic referer data is available through that.<br /><br />We don't keep more than 14 days of Apache access and error logs -- we simply host too many sites to retain more than that.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3">koitsu</a> — Thu Jul 26, 2012 7:32 pm</p><hr />

The reason is pretty simple: because maintaining the redirects still requires me to retain some degree of responsibility / administrative work.  It's the exact same for the Email redirections.  I'm absolutely 100% certain someone we've hosted will complain that some redirect "doesn't work the way they want", or "wants one thing directed one place, and another somewhere else" -- and the same with Email.<br /><br />Email redirections will still affect people as a result of my choice of DNSBLs, which historically has impacted users many times over (and I've grown very tired of having to juggle anti-spam methodologies/etc. to keep a few people happy while upsetting others).  I cannot tersely explain this situation.  The thing I've learned is that <strong>I never should have begun offering hosted Email services.</strong>  It's now become a serious hindrance.<br /><br />In fact, I'm already in a fairly heated discussion with one of our users about the Email redirections; apparently "until October" isn't long enough for him.  I told him "I'm willing to extend this for you until December", which <strong>also</strong> apparently isn't long enough for him.  Apparently he wants the redirection for 2-3 <strong>years</strong> -- no I'm not kidding.  I told him December is the cut-off point for him period, and I'm not willing to extend it any further.  He's quite pissed off ("I have hundreds of places I have to change my Email address"), and as much as I can understand that, that really isn't my problem.  I can't make everyone happy.<br /><br />I suppose all of this would make more sense if I finished doing my write-up on why the doors are closing in the first place.<br /><br />The other problem with redirections is that they allow people to be lazy.  There's no incentive for someone to actually get up off their butt and fix links or update their Email addresses if things just continue working indefinitely.  And if that's the case, then why even bother closing our doors at all?  There has to be a point where a person says "enough is enough".  Since I'm the one who has to deal with it all, that point is "the sooner the better".<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3">koitsu</a> — Thu Jul 26, 2012 5:52 pm</p><hr />
