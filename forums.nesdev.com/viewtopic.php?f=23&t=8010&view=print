Now supports H or V or single screen. And thus, I've started work on Megaman 2 for PCE, and have plans for Metroid soon.
<br />
<br /> Does Megaman 2 use more APU 'features' than Megaman 1? 'Cause I need to upgrade the APU emulation and something desirable to work with/on. I can't wait to be playing MM2 on PCE <img src="./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" />

<br />MM2 uses the same short-period noise channel effect in its music, just as MM1 did.  I think they use the same (similar) music drivers anyway, since neither of them turns off the frequency sweep registers upon startup.

<br />
<br /> I extended the functionality of the NES OAM table to include some PCE support. Makes it easier to hack the original game routines/code. In the MM1 example, I only started upgrading Megaman sprites (32x32, 15 color frames). I was also adding some 'dma' like modes (just subroutines) that would copy the extra pixel information to the extended bit planes or normally unused palette data entries. I figured, keep it like it's add on feature of the NES - keeping the PCE layer invisible. I dunno. I figured it would be easier if anyone else was going to change such maps/tiles/sprites.
<br />
<br /> Note: Using any of the upper palette slots results in the sprite flipping to be based on a 16x16 sprite cell, not 8x8 (which normally get's offsets added to get flipped correctly since PCE doesn't support 8x8 sprite cells).

I could have written the emulation code in pure 6502 for the PCE and used pretty much any compatible assembler, but there isn't any advantage in doing that  - that I can see. PCEAS works fine for me and others in the scene, so I have no plans make or use another PCE/TG16 assembler. For the time it takes to write a "better" assembler, and from scratch no less, I could be doing something else that's more enjoyable to work on <img src="./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" /><br /><br /><br /> I hope you don't missunderstand, I have no source code for Megaman or any of these projects. I'm just simply assembling over the original binary to convert the port read/writes to JSRs. The emulation itself is source code, but that's irrelevant. The game code has no idea it exists and thinks it running on the original platform. It's not like using the SMB 1 source code to rebuild the game for PCE. It's nothing like that at all.<br /><br /> And in that respect, you can hack the rom as if it were on the NES platform. Well, taking into account there's 16k of code/data at the beginning of the binary that now offsets the rom by that much. And that's why I making the 'upgrades' as a layer that would be part of the NES. As best I can. So on a hacking level, it would be more like hacking an NES game rather than writing specific PCE code and specific pce hardware interfacing (which a NES asm hacker probably isn't really familiar with). It doesn't give you full access to the PCE hardware/advantages. If that's what someone needs, then they need to write the game (engine/simulator) from scratch. That's not to say you can't at least have <em>some</em> nice benefits though. I have a build of Megaman that has hooks for the music routine, and plays Red Book audio instead. Sound FX still PSG, but I had planned on adding ADPCM support for them too.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">But anyway, very cool project!

I had all the megaman sprite frames converted to 32x32 cells, but they were still the original colors/pixels. I needed something to show off something that wasn't quite obvious from those cells.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">But then...

<br /> I'm a bit confused. What do you need from NESASM3 in order to write PCE code, that makes PCEAS not a choice/option?

I have quite a few NES projects like this, but the motivation just really isn't there to do too much with them. But I love MM 1 and 2. Both games are dear to me, so I've decided to give these my focus instead of trying juggle other games too. And enough focus to upgrade these games too. Sprites, tiles, colors, music, fx, etc. I'd love to do a MM 1 and 2 compilation. I've already had some other features in mind. Like 'easy' mode stuff/features for gamers that suck at Megaman &lt;snicker&gt;. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /> Saving to bram, etc. <br /><br /> I'm looking for some help, once that is the main focus (it is for Megaman 1 currently, so I could use some for that one).<br /><br />Hamtaro126L: I'm still confused.

The plastic itself is deep enough for surface mount rom. And in fact the SCD system card just has stock surface mount ram for memory chips. I just need to find a place that can not only mold and provide me a plastic casing - but also to be able to print something on it (unless decals are easier).<br /><br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">Mega Man Powered Up for PSP is a huge graphical upgrade to Mega Man 1.</div>
<br />
<br /> I played the hell out of that (and the megaman x remake for the psp too). But this is just... different. I dunno. Having the original game engine still intact and running is just awesome <img src="./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /> I guess it would be easier to just do this on a PC, but where's the fun in that? Retro console coding is where it's at.

<br />Well the Syntax is not that good right now, if I use your PCEAS:
<br />
<br />the BANK problem is not fixed, it is still in the 8k limit, at least for source files!
<br />
<br />Opcode B4 (LDY NameofLabel,X) is not availible? Wow!
<br />
<br />NESASM v3.1 fixed these issues, so maybe a new version of your PCEAS can implent these?
<br />
<br />Even then, Macros are hard to come by for this. so maybe making sure there is a new macro library for PCEAS soon, so maybe it can be more easier for homebrewers or hackers to implent thier NES games/hacks to PCE, or even thier own PCE homebrews!

<br />
<br /> Opcode $B4 assembles just fine. 
<br />
<br /> I think you're just not familiar enough PCEAS. All ZP addressing modes that are not indirect, need the "&lt;" operator preceding the address or label. LDY &lt;label,x or LDY &lt;$00,x etc. The only time you don't need it, is when you use an indirect mode. lda [label] or lda [$00]. 
<br />
<br /> The problem with bank issue with PCEAS isn't that you can't write more than 8k of code, it's that it errors out if an opcode crosses a page boundary. If you're writing code from scratch, it's pretty easy to fix/over come. But yeah, if you're porting code then it can be a potential pain in the ass. But the new PCEAS source and binary I release/posted fixes this:
<br />
<br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.pcedev.net/pceas/bin/pceas_w32_07_10_2011.7z">http://www.pcedev.net/pceas/bin/pceas_w32_07_10_2011.7z</a><!-- m -->

<br />
<br /> Like I mentioned in the other thread, it has some new directives as well.
<br />
<br /> The high level logic in PCEAS is pretty good IMO. Any kind of high level math that any other good assembler has support for. The MACRO support in PCEAS is top notch too. I've seen too many assemblers with poor or lacking macro support. No good.
<br />
<br /> I guess I should do a real manual for PCEAS, since there really isn't anything out there for it. It took me a while to figure out how to use SIZEOF() correctly.
