There is another possibility. One of the demos by Bob Rost showed IRQs can have seperate palettes. So maybe it can be applied to the Player colors, as well as enemies.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=287">Hamtaro126</a> — Thu Jul 10, 2008 5:37 pm</p><hr />

This thread is a few months old, but oh well...<br /><br />I don't want to kill the authenticity of the project, but perhaps we are looking at this all wrong. Maybe the best(and possibly the least daunting) way to achieve 2p Co-op SMB is to make an engine for the PC that closely, if not precisely, recreates the physics and graphics of the original, with the addition of a 2 player mode. I would imagine that it should look something like this:<br /><br /><img src="http://img502.imageshack.us/img502/7717/titlere1.png" alt="Image" /><br /><br /><img src="http://img149.imageshack.us/img149/2027/world23yq1.png" alt="Image" /><br /><br /><img src="http://img142.imageshack.us/img142/632/world93kv4.png" alt="Image" /><br /><br /><br />On a PC, it's 320x240 resolution also is better, because it gives more room for 2 players to move around in, compared to the 256x225 of the NES. Also, the reserve item would have the option of being disabled, for those who are looking for more authentic gameplay. <br /><br />Someday, I will make this... when I finally get around to becoming a programmer. <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3573">Roric23</a> — Thu Jul 10, 2008 2:24 am</p><hr />

Super Smash Bros.

Specific colors are necessary for them to be differentiated and identifiable - otherwise, it could be confusing to identify what's a Super Mushroom (red) and what's a 1UP mushroom (green or cyan+brown).  I wouldn't be surprised if you can encounter a Goomba, Green Koopa, and Red Koopa all at once.  Other palette conflicting stuff (jump springs, hammers, fireballs, platforms, beanstalks, coin block hits, flagpoles, and brick animations) could change their palettes during different level/level types, but I think mushrooms (at least 1 kind, the Super Mushroom in this case) need to have specific palettes.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3329">strangenesfreak</a> — Mon Apr 07, 2008 6:53 pm</p><hr />
