To quote <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oversampling" class="postlink">Wikipedia</a>:<div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">In signal processing, oversampling is the process of sampling a signal with a sampling frequency significantly higher than the Nyquist rate. [...] The Nyquist rate is defined as twice the highest frequency component in the signal.</div> The Nyquist rate of the NES's audio is also, surprise surprise, its sample rate. The fact that it contains frequencies all the way up to half that rate is exactly why a resampler is needed.<br /><br />But you're right, arguing semantics isn't helpful. I just don't want people to hear &quot;oversampled&quot; and think it's either a) something unnecessary that the NES itself doesn't do, or b) some kind of enhancement that makes your implementation better than other emulators (or actual hardware) that don't &quot;oversample&quot;.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">rainwarrior wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">Actually, to give you an idea why this affects performance so much for NSFPlay, how often it has to jump back and forth between CPU emulation and generating samples really adds a lot of overhead, and as a side effect negatively affects code caching / branch prediction / etc. at the same time. One of my planned ideas for performance improvement will be to institute the concept of CPU&lt;-&gt;audio sync points so it can operate on longer buffers at a time, but that's going to be a big overhaul of the how original code worked. I suspect eventually, the idea of needing to undersample the NES might even be able to disappear, but for now it's deeply rooted in how it works. (If you look at other old NSF players, like NotSoFatso, this was pretty commonly done.)</div><br />Yep, repeat does that too. One cycle at a time. One word: ouch.<br /><br />That's why I stopped working on it, in favour of a VGM player that uses logs and batching to run hundreds or thousands of cycles of each channel before moving onto the next. Once I get around to re-implementing the NES audio chips, I'll rip out my NES CPU emulator, make it spit out a write log, and let the audio emulation run in batches as large as it likes. But that's a ways off yet.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">rainwarrior wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">As for integer vs float... yeah I mean we have good vector hardware for floats these days. I'm not sure if NSFPlay will ever make it to float, but it's something that could be done in theory at least. If this were a starting-from-scratch situation it would be a lot easier to write something from the beginning that would be easier to switch to one or the other with a #define. (...maybe for NSFPlay 3.)</div><br />Would it be helpful to anyone if I put my resampler code up somewhere? It needs a good cleanup, but I feel obliged to put my money (or rather code) where my mouth is, so to speak.

I concede that parts of the APU would need to be emulated on the CPU side of the pipe as well, such as length counters if the program reads $4015.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Accounting for all cycles and, when resampling, an accurate lowpass filter are needed for accurate results. Some box car interpolation can speed up the process, but the larger the ratio, the more inconsistent the attenuation. In my own tests, however, I've found that FIR alone can deliver messy results. So I've found a balance between the two.<br /><br />Attached is 96 KHz, a box car of 4:1, followed by FIR (Blackman-Nutall, 160 taps). The results are pretty clean, although the mixed channel portions differ from the hardware render.
