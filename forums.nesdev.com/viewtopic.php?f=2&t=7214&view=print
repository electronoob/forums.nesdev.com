		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Well even though I've been in NESdev since 5+ years I still have doubts if it is a good idea !
<br />
<br />Maybe we could share "traps" to avoid though. I have been on a game project for 5+ years, and the more the time pass, the less I do any progress. At first (started in 2005) I worked on it very hard and it was progressing very fast, the game engine was complete in 2007, then I made many improvement to it in 2008, and then I did really little progress, I only implemented a few more enemies and levels going on very slowly.
<br />
<br />A trap is to start to code before having a ready game design. You should get ideas for a complete game, including many enemies, last bosses, etc... before you start programming. I had an idea just for one level and so I coded one level, and got stuck...

<br />You cannot expect the majority of people to consider it a decent hobby nor expect them to respect the work you put into it. On the other hand, the internet makes it easy to get in contact with people interested in retro gaming. Members of sites like nintendoage are going to love what you do. If that's alright with you, by all means, go for it.
<br />
<br />My personal motivation is that it's been a childhood dream of mine to make an NES game. It has become kind of an obsession, gotta finish it, no matter what. :)
<br />
<br />Definitely listen to what Bregalad has to say, though. Having an elaborate picture of what the game is going to be like will help a lot. Also, do not underestimate level design and enemy AI + event scripting. It can become quite a daunting task if you don't know what you're getting into.

<br />+ 1 to this, moreover do not underestimate design in general. If you ask me, game design, difficulty balancing, art and level design are the hardest parts of making a game. Programming the engine is easy peasy compared to that, especially with the wealth of information available here and on other websites. Getting good music and sfx for a game is probably the easiest part because the chiptune community is so big.
<br />
<br />As for the original question... No I'm really not sure if it's a good idea at all. Still I find myself sporadically working on a game. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />

<br />
<br />Like miau it has been a dream of mine to make an NES game since I was little.   The nostalgia and the good feeling I get pursuing an old dream is motivation enough for me to keep at it.  If you had the same kind of dream growing up, this is a great hobby.
<br />
<br />Since you come from a rom hacking background, you have a big head start.  Based on the work you've done (assuming you are the same Optomon I think you are) you seem very knowledgeable about the NES, ASM and how the pros did things.  You have the skills to jump right in.  A lot of people start this hobby knowing nothing and do fine.
<br />
<br />As far as taking it seriously, everyone here takes it seriously.  There are regulars that have been posting here for years.  Some people release their games on cart and <a href="http://www.retrousb.com/index.php?cPath=30" class="postlink">sell them</a>.  The collectors over at NintendoAge are enthusiastic about homebrew releases.  Sivak's homebrew Battle Kid got a lot of press, even from <a href="http://gamevideos.1up.com/video/id/28440" class="postlink">mainstream</a> <a href="http://kotaku.com/5435950/kick-off-2010-with-a-brand-new-nes-game" class="postlink">gaming</a> <a href="http://www.joystiq.com/2009/12/28/battle-kid-fortress-of-peril-could-be-the-latest-nes-hit/" class="postlink">sites</a>.  If you make a great game, people will want to play it.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Another approach is---if you don't have a solid idea for your game, as I most definitely did not---make the goals for your game as constrained as possible, in terms of features or size. I had no idea what form my game would finally take, but I knew I wanted the engine and gameplay to be as simple as possible (but still exhibit certain features I wanted, like scrolling). I haven't finished my game yet so time will tell if this was effective or not.
<br />
<br />The number one reason you should make a game is for yourself. If you have a passion for NES games, and you've always wanted to make one that's more than enough of a reason. Selling it on cart, for me, would just be a really fun bonus on top of what I'm doing. I don't expect to make mountains of money on it---but to see my game on a new cart would be really rewarding.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />My reason for it is I want to be a programmer and love assembly and want to see my programs work a NES because it was my first system, too, so it all comes into one and I am working on a game. Despite it being simple and NROM-128 (Would be NROM-64 or even NROM-32 if they existed, haha), I am having problems finishing it.
<br />
<br />
<br />I am stalled on it though, once I got far and got some of the main stuff done for it, I hit a wall. Not a programming wall,but I kept putting work on it off and switching to other stuff, despite I want to still work on it, but now that school has started, too, my time is zero and I haven't worked on it in weeks, so yeah, once you start work, only take breaks once in a while or else starting back on it will be difficult. I just need time to start on it again, re-write some stuff, remember how it works, and fix a few bugs and stuff and add some more details and it'll be done. Just learn from my mistake and don't ever stop, even if it's 10 minutes only reading your code, try not to go a long time not looking at it. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />

<br />I agree with that. Sounds selfish, but the #1 reason to develop games is for your own statisfaction.
<br />I consider myself to be lucky to have skills in programming, music and a little graphical stuff too, which makes me able to program games all my myself. Many people doesn't have this luck. (BTW I such hard at chemistry, biology, litterature, sport and handing out with girls as a compensation of that, but those skills aren't needed to make games  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=":wink:" title="Wink" /> )
<br />
<br />One could say it is important to make game for people who will to play it, but honnestly, when you haven't released your first game, nobody will aim to play it. In fact a few people will, I recevied a few messages of people who said they were impatient to play my game, and this is very appreciated. The might give me some motivation, but this isn't the #1 reason, at least yet. The day someone on here will have a significant fanbase of people asking for games, this might change though.
<br />
<br />When it comes to the commercial things, I agree that sellings actual carts can be quite motivating. HOWEVER I disagree with people publishing their game only on commerical carts, and not releasing any free version, mainly because this is a hobby afterall, and since people freely took time to make free tools to assemble 6502 code, edit graphics, and people in this forum freely answers to any question related to NES development, the least someone can do is release a free version of games.
<br />Nobody will ever be able to feed his family by selling NES games... not that I wouldn't want to do that if it was possible ! I'd be the first to be happy to run an actual game development company as a true job, but I know this is not going to happen.

<br />
<br />There are people that still play and buy NES games. New games have been produced and sold. You are the only one to decide if it's worth your time. For some part of the appeal of the NES is its simplicity or limited nature. You couldn't really make a game yourself to match what is done on systems today. But making a game for NES is reasonable for a small group or just 1 person. 
<br />
<br />Making a game for the NES though is really secondary to actually designing the game. Dealing with the NES hardware isn't that difficult. But designing a full game on any platform is alot more work. You'll have some limits imposed by the NES hardware but still you have the same challenge of designing a game.

<br />Yeah, I do have about 5 hours in the afternoon, but when I can't sit down and get 8 hours of work done, I don't like to work on it. 1 hour work, 30 minutes to eat, get sucked onto facebook forever browsing the web, get back focusing on the game, then go take a shower and get ready, but then it's like 10PM.

<br />You don't really realize yet how much time you have. I would kill just to have that much time on my hand to work on my personal stuff. From your answer, you really don't know yet how to manage it.
<br />
<br />If you really can't do anything because you don't have 8h, you will never do anything. This is just an excuse you made yourself to avoid working on it. In brief, this is called procrastinating and we are all good at that <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />
<br />
<br />Wait until you have to work long hours, have to commute long time, have kids that needs your attention and don't want to sleep until late time and you will realize after how much time you had. When you can play only 15 min more or less on a game and you get excited about it, you will realize more what I'm talking about.
<br />
<br />Maybe deep inside you don't want to work on that project anymore. Only you will be able to make the final decision.
