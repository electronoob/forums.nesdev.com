The "shooting" variable will be set to 1 when the player presses A, but since he will release it soon after, "shooting" will become 0. According to the logic you posted before that would stop the bullet.
<br />
<br />I think your frame logic should be more like this:
<br />
<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">IF A IS PRESSED AND THERE ARE FREE BULLETS<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;RESET THE NEXT FREE BULLET TO THE PLAYER'S POSITION<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;ACTIVATE THAT BULLET<br />END IF<br /><br />FOR EACH ACTIVE BULLET<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;MOVE BULLET UP<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;IF BULLET COLLIDED WITH ENEMY<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;KILL ENEMY<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;DEACTIVATE BULLET<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;END IF<br />NEXT BULLET</div>
<br />
<br />EDIT: Also, be sure to read <a href="http://nesdev.com/bbs/viewtopic.php?p=62142#62142" class="postlink">this post and the ones after it</a>, because they explain how to avoid repeated button detection. If you don't do what's explained in that thread, whenever someone presses "A" at least 5 or so bullets will be shot at once. Ideally, you will only fire bullets when the fire button transitions from not pressed to pressed, and those posts explain how to detect that transition.

I am starting to understand variables pretty well now, and how how they work in 6502 ASM. I decided to go with the .rsset and .rs method because it seems to be the best to use. This is what i cam up with for my problem (this will most likely be changed as the shooting system will be more efficient, in fact there isnt even one yet <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /> ):
<br />
<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">ReadA:<br />&nbsp; LDA $4016<br />&nbsp; AND #%00000001<br />&nbsp; BEQ ReadADone<br /><br />&nbsp; LDA #$01<br />&nbsp; STA shooting<br /><br />&nbsp; LDA #$00<br />&nbsp; CMP shooting<br />&nbsp; BEQ DontShoot<br /><br />&nbsp; LDA #$01<br />&nbsp; CMP shooting<br />&nbsp; BEQ Shoot<br /><br />DontShoot:<br />&nbsp; LDA #$FE<br />&nbsp; STA $0204<br /><br />Shoot:<br />&nbsp; LDA #$80<br />&nbsp; STA $0204<br /><br />ReadADone:<br /></div>
<br />
<br />this just stores a bullet off screen when a is not pressed, then when it is it moves to the middle of the screen. Next i will set up a shooting system.

<br />
<br />This won't translate well to any game of size though, I'd suggest you do a JSR to a controller reading routine and then just read the button states and edit it there. There's no game to my knowledge that does hard coding of it like that, it's a doomed way to write it. Heh. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" />

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />The only reason beginners find this weird method of controller reading easy is because some famous beginner tutorial uses it, but in reality it makes no sense at all to use that.
<br />
<br />The simplest and most common way to read controller is to shift the states of all buttons into a variable and check that variable for the rest of the frame. There are 8 buttons, there are 8 bits in a byte, the most logical thing to do is use a bit to indicate the state of each button.
<br />
<br />Also, it's good practice to separate the game logic from the hardware interactions. Say that for some reason you decide to convert your game to another platform that uses a 6502. As your code is now, you'll have to scan through all of the code looking for interactions with the $4016 register and change each one, because there will be a lot of them. If instead you made a separate subroutine whose only purpose was to read $4016 and put the button states in a byte, that would be all you'd have to change, because your game logic would only need that byte, regardless of where its contents came from. Your game logic wouldn't be tied to the hardware anymore, it's just common sense.
<br />
<br />The same goes for video and audio. You must have a set of routines to deal with the PPU and the APU, but they should be as separated from the game logic as possible. For example, if your game uses missiles, the code that moves the missiles shouldn't be the same code that configures the OAM to display the missiles' sprites... The missile code should <strong>call</strong> a routine that draws sprites based on a set of parameters (such as a pointer to the meta-sprite definition), and this routine alone should mess with the OAM.
<br />
<br />This is how professional games work. Even in AS3 (which you mentioned you know) you should work like this. If you program everything carelessly just to get results on the screen ASAP you'll end up with unmaintainable code, and this is one of the big reasons people give up on projects.

<br />

If not done, get more button states.<br />RTS ;Done, ControllerButtonStates now holds all button states.<br /></div>
<br />
<br />And now, you have a controller reading program for every game that uses just the brick controller. All you have to do is a JSR and you read the buttons you need them. What happens when you have to read and see if left+right are pressed? With this, instead of doing the right 4016 read, another 4016 read, a 4016 reset then shift back to where you were, it's rediculous. With this, you can check multiple states easily and you're not hoping back and forth on 4016, which you'll run into later following that way.
