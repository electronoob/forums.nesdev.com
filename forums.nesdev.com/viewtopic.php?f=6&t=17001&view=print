I wonder how common it would be to take advantage of such potentially long sequences?<br /><br />If I allowed each to occupy a single 256 byte sequence could just have &quot;instruments&quot; where each of these type of sequences start at different points, and then I'd only have to load the address for the current instrument once. The only types of sequences which are usually long are volume and pitch. From what I've seen and used myself, arpeggios and duty are typically very very short. In fact I've never actually seen a looping duty envelope or used one, I typically just have a max of 2 values where the first creates a crisp &quot;attack&quot; sound.

How long was your longest envelope? I'm thinking of making the above described change; it may make ggsound approach famitone's speed (but bring along other advantages  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_cool.gif" alt="8-)" title="Cool" />  )

My hope is since the engine spends most of its time updating sequences that this could save a couple hundred cycles per frame. The constraint would be that all envelopes in use by any given instrument must all fit together in one 256 byte sequence. In actual practice, it seems like this should work. Really really long instruments that aren't long due to a loop point are pretty rare I think. Any extreme situations where it does need to be longer could just play a new note that starts where the last envelope leaves off...

For the compo, i think we're a little too late to be swapping drivers haha!<br /><br />Yeah, basically you can substitute all gliss/portamento effects (1xx, 2xx, 3xx, Rxy and Qxy) with looped single entry pitch envelopes in most cases as long as they accumulate across the loop seam. Might need a couple of dedicated instruments per &quot;sound&quot; to be doing in an agile fashion, but still.  two or three entries gives you even more precise control of the rate, and it's a trivial addition.
