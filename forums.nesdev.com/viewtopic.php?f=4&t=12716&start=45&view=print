The amount of discrete logic chips will start to compare to a small CPLD which could provide a much richer feature set.  In reality once you start separating things into separate registers you're getting into the MMC1 scale mapper level.

Looks like the <a href="https://www.dialog-semiconductor.com/products/slg46824" class="postlink">slg46824</a> would be the best part to target as it's I2C in system programmable and also comes in more friendly TSSOP-20 packaging with high i/o and flipflop count in comparison to other versions (17 i/o &amp; FF's).  Other parts appear to have pretty good pricing available for purchase on their site $0.30-0.50ea if you can handle the 100-3k min qty.  No indications of the slg46824's pricing though, shot off a sales inquiry to see what they have to say..

Looks like the SL46824 is <em>brand new</em> too.<br /><br />I'm a little confused by their claim that the '824 there supports 17 I/O—unlike some of the older ones, I don't see a way to turn off the I²C logic unit, so that's two pins permanently lost.<br /><br />But I bet 15 I/O is still enough—for something that's the same features as GTROM but with three registers would require ... in: /rs a14 a13 a12 m2 d0 d1 d2 d3 ppua13 ; out: a15 a16 a17 a18  chra14 — that's exactly 15.<br /><br />... oops, that doesn't include one input and output to invert R/W into W/R for self-flashing. Hm.
