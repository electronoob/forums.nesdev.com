		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I went to play some punchout today and could not get the game to go in all the way. I tried another game and no luck.  Upon carefull inspection I found that a gecko had crawled into my NES and was blocking the game.  I took it apart and released him outside, while I had it apart I replaced the red LED with an orange one.  Moral of the story: Always close that dust cover because you never know whats going to end up in there.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />That is FUNNY! Oh my god... A gecko? I would probably scream, just because I don't like to have wild anythings in my house. If it was like my sister's pet, then I wouldn't be afraid, but since it's wild, I'd be scared. But I think I'd die laughing if I saw that happen. By the way, you should open your pictures in paint, shrink them, then post them here. It's annoying to have to have text going off screen. It's okay though, I guess. This also should have been in NES hardware as well, but I won't get too picky. That's just too funny...

<br />Should really be moved to general, since it has nothing to do with NES development.

<br />
<br />What do you think the walls, ceiling, and limited openings to the outside of a modern building are imitating? People often leave their door open, allowing animals inside. An occasional lizard is all the wildlife I see in my second-floor apartment.
