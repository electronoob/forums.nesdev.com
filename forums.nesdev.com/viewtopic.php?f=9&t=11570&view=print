		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I've got a question coming in from a friend, basically the thing is, he really hates how short the cables of the Famicom controllers are and wants to know if the standard is the same as the NES controllers, which would make it possible to cut the Famicom and NES controller cables, and solder the NES controller to the famicom controller cable.<br /><br />Or if that doesn't work, a workaround could be using a replacable controller on the extra port, but I'm not sure how many games there are that only read from ports 1 and 2. Thank you for your answers!

Also, they changed the colors of the wires inside the cables, so it won't just be brown-&gt;brown.<br /><br />Reportedly, most 1- or 2-player games for the Famicom treat players 3 and 4 as duplicates of players 1 and 2, so an ordinary Famicom 4-player adapter should work, too.

That way you don't have to destroy any original parts.<br /><br />Yes, the controllers are compatible, they use the same set of connections for either the Famicom or NES, though obviously the NES second controller can't produce the microphone signal.

I can sort-of live with the short cables, but I really don't like the fact that the cables are connected to the side of the controllers instead of to the top.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I made mine. All you need are two female NES cables, and the Famicom expansion port fits a Neo Geo controller cable. After that it's just a matter of connecting the correct wires together.<br /><br />I've seen pre-built ones on eBay and maybe other places, just google it I guess.<br /><br />There is one caveat that not all games listen for the expansion controller bit. So far I haven't seen any Famicom game that don't work with them, but if you play western NES games with a converter there are a few that won't work with it (e.g. Solar Jetman). Also as mentioned above, a 4-player game will treat the expansion controllers as players 3 and 4.

This has the added advantage of leaving your microphone working!  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />Another trick is that you can in fact hook a SNES controller up to a NES/Famicom as the SNES controller just has 2 shift-registers instead of the single 8-bit one in an 8-bit generation's controller.  If you can make a clean-looking SNES connector using something like an extension cord for the SNES controller, then you can use an otherwise unused/reserved pin on the plug to run your microphone and put it on a 3.5mm cord?  That would actually be pretty sweet with a hands-free set.  Well, if there were actually tons of games that you <span style="text-decoration: underline">needed</span> a mike to play.
