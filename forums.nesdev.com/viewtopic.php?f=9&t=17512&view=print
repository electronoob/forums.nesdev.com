Read this paragraph very very closely:<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">A Duck Hunt game cartridge. We're not distributing the game; we're distributing a device that patches the game. You still have the game from 1990 too, right? (The patch board also supports the SMB / Duck Hunt multicart that was commonly included with NESes.)</div><br />Price is ridiculous if it's all designed with *one single game* in mind.  Makes the product almost as &quot;exclusive&quot; (read: gimmicky) as the NES ROB.<br /><br />Edit: Just wanted to add that I think it's a neat/great idea/project regardless, but for the cost I'd hope it could handle all the other Zapper games.

The board hardware could apply a patch to any game (just needs more patches to be added to it).<br /><br />The patch is necessary to accommodate lag. (It also means it has more prominent blank/white-square screens flashes, too.)<br /><br />The light gun mod at least is a general thing that allows it to see light from an LCD TV, but without the software accounting for lag the light will arrive too late to be read anyway. So... you need a per-game patch.<br /><br />I'd actually be interested in just the light gun mod portion, if the price was (a lot) lower. I made my own lag patch for Duck Hunt a while back when I was testing out how the light gun worked.

Once the Wii Remote patent expires around 2026, it'll become practical to commercialize this.

There's like a hundred different ways to do an aiming device, and there's many third party wiimote and sensor replacements already. That's assuming that you even want to make the wiimote directly part of the product, which it doesn't have to be. There's thousands of Wiimote accessories on the market.<br /><br />Thanks for the reminder about that better thing though. I didn't realize it was all open source too. Might be worth getting an arduino to build my own...

People will probably create patches for every lightgun game in a spontaneous community effort if there's hardware with decent availability and documentation that makes it worth it. People that want to play can simply do so on a powerpak or switch out ROM chips.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Yeah, making this all about Duck Hunt specifically was not the way to go... I don't think there are 1000 people in the world (though this campaign is limited to the US!) willing to pay that much to play just Duck Hunt.<br /><br />I agree with Punch... I bet that the &quot;patch board&quot; adds a lot to the cost, so it'd probably make more sense to count on backers having flash carts (I bet that almost anyone who still regularly plays on an original NES also owns a flash cart, it's a basic item in any collection by now) and make patches for at least a few of the most popular Zapper games that players can apply themselves. Maybe even make the patch boards optional for the few that would prefer them over flash carts, but don't make them mandatory. The promise of making the specs public so that homebrewers can also support the new device would surely help the campaign too.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />This campaign won't be funded at their current goal, so talk of what should have been done is more to instruct the next guy.  <br /><br />If they made IPS patches for each game, that would give them a sizeable market right away, namely flash cart owners.  In that case, the customer need only buy the board that replaces the light gun's internals.  That board looks inexpensive.<br /><br />As has been observed, the main cost of their solution is the patch board, which only works with one game!  Not a great value for $129.00.  <br /><br />They talk about making their patch board an external solution with a Game Genie and imply that the firmware can be updated, but the board shot suggests the only way to do that is with something like a JTAG programmer.  <br /><br />The number of games that support or require the Zapper numbers only twenty, so patching 20 games does not seem to be an insurmountable goal.  <br /><br />The explanation of why they won't ship to Europe, &quot;The additional regulatory complexity of selling in other countries makes such exports infeasible for now&quot; is inexplicable unless they are not complying with RoHS or something similar.

I'm just saying that there's a big market of NES fans out there that don't have flash carts. That said, those people aren't as likely to stumble across his kickstarter and be interested either)
