Memblers: Thanks for the confirmation on bankswitching! And I think MCK just renames the .NES file to .NSF after compiling..? It looked like that but I'm not sure.<br /><br />Quietust: Ah.. Looks like I'll have to try and make myself an NSF cart then! Or maybe I could pay someone to do it.. <br /><br />Alex<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=871">flipside</a> — Sun Aug 13, 2006 9:42 pm</p><hr />

You can't use CopyNES's NSF function with a plain RAM cart - even with a non-bankswitched NSF, it requires the bank switching logic to be present (since it loads ALL of the banks into the same 4KB address range, switching banks each time). At least that's what kevtris said when I reported the same problem. Supposedly, it would be possible to use a custom plugin of some sort to upload a non-banked NSF to an NRAM cart, though I don't know the details.<br /><br />Of course, it's also possible that the NSF cart functionality in CopyNESW is broken, since I don't have an NSF cart to test it with.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=7">Quietust</a> — Sun Aug 13, 2006 3:29 pm</p><hr />

Hey all!<br /><br />I have gotten and installed a COPYNES board, and I've also got a RAM cart. My goal is to be able to write my tracks in MML, converting to NSF and transfering to the NES for playback and recording of the output. <br /><br />I'll probably be laying down my ideas with my other more hands-on gear and logic, but when I have something ready I want to transcribe it to the NES.<br /><br />The problem is, I understand I can only use non-bankswitched NSFs on a RAM cart, otherwise I need an NSF cart. But will it really be a problem for me to rely on non-bankswitched NSFs? I'll only be sending my own NSFs to the cart, and I'll be soloing parts to record them separately.<br /><br />I'm mainly a musician, and I mess around alot with synths and programming them and stuff, but programming of the NES is not very obvoius to me yet, so I don't understand this bankswitching stuff fully yet. I have started to make a basic understanding of writing MML though. <br /><br />Does bankswitching mean that the NES can only view a certain ammount of memory locations, but you have more available and a way to access this is to switch between these locations?<br /><br />Is this only relevant when you have music together with a game, and not needed when you just write music?<br /><br />Then there's another problem. When I try to transfer a very simple NSF to the RAM cart for playback, it doesn't work. I've tried adding a #NO-BANKSWITCH but it doesn't seem to make any difference. <br /><br />The CopyNESW client says:<br /><br /><em>Initializing parallell port...<br />Resetting CopyNES...<br />Setting CopyNES to NSF player mode...<br />Uploading NSF header...</em><br /><br />Then it stops and I get this error:<br /><br /><em>An error occurred during the previous operation!</em><br /><br />My songdata.mml looks like this:<br /><br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">#TITLE test chip<br />#COMPOSER flipside<br />#PROGRAMER flipside<br />#NO-BANKSWITCH<br /><br />@v0 = &#123; 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 &#125;<br />@v1 = &#123; 15 15 14 14 13 13 12 12 11 11 10 10 9 9 8 8 7 7 6 6 &#125;<br /><br />ABCDE t150<br /><br />A l8 o4 @01 @v0<br />A &#91;c d e f @v1 g4 @v0 a16 b16 &gt;c c d e f @v1 g4 @v0 a16 b16 &gt;c&lt;&lt;&#93;2</div><br /><br />Yeah it's just some basic stuff off of the mck/mml tutorial.<br /><br />The PC seems to connect with the copynes, because when I run CopyNESW.exe it says:<br /><br /><em>Querying CopyNES BIOS version<br />Waiting for reply<br />CopyNES identified as version 2</em><br /><br />I've also tried just running the original program without the windows client:<br /><br />When I run QBASIC and start NESDUMP2.BAS, and try to "Play NSF" it says "Invalid directory - no .NSF files found!" But it seems that no matter how I edit COPYNES.INI, all paths are set to SAVE_PATH1=<br /><br />So - when I enter OPTIONS, .PRG save path, .CHR save path etc etc are all set to whatever I write in "SAVE PATH1=". I tried setting this to ./NSF/, but I still get invalid directory.<br /><br />I've tried reading around at this forum, but there's really a lot of information to sort out.. If this already have been adressed though, I would appreciate it if I could just get a nudge to the right thread.<br /><br />This looks like a nice place, I've already learned a lot just looking around.<br /><br />Best,<br />Alex<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=871">flipside</a> — Sun Aug 13, 2006 12:23 pm</p><hr />
