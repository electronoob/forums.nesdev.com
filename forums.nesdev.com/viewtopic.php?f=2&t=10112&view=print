		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I have been trying really hard on my own, to create a custom irq engine with my Zelda hack, which at the time was using MMC3. I scrapped the idea back when i figured out how to manipulate the Sprite 0 irq setup within Zelda 1. But the original Sprite 0 irq within Zelda 1, will not allow me to do certain things which require the use of sprites.<br /><br />So a few days ago, i went back to my old MMC3 version, to see if i could get my irq engine to work again.  The issue that i've always had, is that i cant get the scanline to go past 3C or 3D. 01 obviously is the top of the screen. I'm able to adjust the value for the scanline from 01-3C, but, if i goto about 3D and onward, i will get severe flickering, and the game will eventually crash. Also, this seems to happen when i move Link around on the screen too, BUT ONLY WHEN THE SCANLINE IS CLOSE TO THE POINT OF SCREWING UP.<br /><br />I original based my attempts of the irq engine within Megaman 4. But then i started wondering if it has to do with the fact the Zelda 1 runs on 8x16 sprites, since Megaman 4 runs on 8x8 sprites. <br /><br />So i tried messing around with the irq engine within Super Mario Bros 3, since i'm pretty sure that game runs on 8x16 sprites. I tried inserting certain things from that irq setup, into my rom hack, but i kept getting errors.<br /><br />What i do have inserted into my rom, works to an extent, I just cant get the scanline to go any further.<br /><br />Whats even more bizzare, is that this scanline screws up just before it passes the bottom of the HUD (Link's map, hearts, item count, etc) But this shouldnt be a problem, since the Sprite 0 is only activated when a screen scroll is initiated, that's when $200-$203 gets changed to setup the Sprite 0 irq engine.<br /><br />I am not an expert at this stuff, i just try to see what goes on, and see if i can manipulate it into my game. I'd like to share my work for everyone, and see if there is something that i'm either missing, or have coded incorrectly. <br /><br />The purpose of all of this, is that i am trying to keep the HUD to stay at the top of the screen, while i can freely move the screen below the HUD. Down the road i'm going to try to create massive moving BG bosses in my game, but without an irq engine, that is impossible.<br /><br />So before i share my stuff, my game runs on 8x16 sprites, my sprite ppu is located at PPU $0-$FFF, and my bg ppu is located at PPU $1000-$1FFF. By bankswap routine is based off of Super Mario Bros 2. And, i apologize to those who write in text with 6502, i only know how to write via hex mode, that's how i've always coded for 8 years.<br /><br /><strong>Custom Zelda Bankswap Routine</strong><br />-----------------------------------------<br />0A 48 A906 8D0080 68 8D0180 0901 48 A907 8D0080 68 8D0180 60<br /><br /><strong>Custom Zelda IRQ Engine</strong><br />-------------------------------<br /><strong>$8000E-$8000F</strong> = 04F9<br /><br /><strong>$7F914</strong> = 08 48 8A 48 98 48 8D00E0 8D01E0 6C1201 ($112-$113 contains low/high byte of current irq)<br /><br /><strong>$8000A-$8000B</strong> = E0F8<br /><br /><strong>$7F8F0</strong> = 58 AD1401 8D00C0 8D01C0 AE1001 9D00E0 F00F AE1101 (BD25F9_low byte address of irq asm) 8D1201 (BD27F9_high byte address of irq asm) 8D1301 (4C80FF_the rest of my game)<br /><br />Now, my 1st irq, isnt an irq, it just points to 8D00E0 68 A8 68 AA 68 28 40<br /><br />The 2nd irq, is the one i'm trying to use, but i cant get the scanline past 3C or 3D without it flickering all to hell then crashing, and sometimes when i move link around, it'll start to glitch as well. So here is the 2nd irq asm.<br /><br /><strong>$7F943</strong> = AD0220 AC1501 0D1601 A9F4 8D0620 8D0620 A5FF 8D0020 AD1701 8D0520 8D0520 (4C29F9_jmp's to 8D00E0 68 A8 68 AA 68 28 40)

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />If you're using an MMC3, and are also using 8x16 sprites, you need to do special things.  Sprites must use the right pattern table and backgrounds must use the left pattern table, otherwise it won't work correctly.  So for Zelda 1, you'll need to hack the code that loads graphics to put it into the correct place, then hack where it selects which pattern tables to display for backgrounds, then change the sprite indexes to use the right pattern table.<br /><br />If you can't do all that, try another mapper that uses cycle-based IRQs instead of PPU A12 changes.

The IRQ flag (I) wasn't being set correctly when the game starting missing frames.The solution I used was to leave IRQs enabled from start up, but just point the handler to an RTS when no raster effects were in use.<br /><br />I've got it working for FME-7 if you'd like the code. I used it to draw text boxes on the unused nametable and swap in a full font.

I mean, when a game uses a sprite 0 hit to create a status bar at the top of the screen, it will usually only start the actual game logic calculations after it's done with the status bar. If the same is happening with your MMC3 IRQ and no frame calculations are being performed until the IRQ fires, it makes sense that you can't go past a certain point, since from that point on there's not enough time to finish the frame calculations in time for VBlank. It also explains the screwing up when Link is moving, because there are more calculations the engine has to do when the player is moving, so things screw up earlier.

If you don't know what the code you're injecting is doing, the chances of this working are pretty slim, I must say.<br /><br />Anyway, games that use sprite 0 hits usually wait for the hit in a loop. This loop doesn't do anything to process game logic, it just waits for the sprite hit in order to create a screen split and only then the program moves on to process game logic. If you hack maintains this loop and it waits for the IRQ, you won't be able to split the screen far from the top of the screen, otherwise too much time will be spent waiting and too little will be available for game logic.<br /><br />What you need to do is allow the logic to start as soon as possible, because it will be interrupted when the IRQ happens. Then, in the IRQ handler, you take care of the split and return to the game logic. This will guarantee that most of the frame time will be available to the actual game, so you won't ever run out of time.

Im trying to do something from the ground up, something ive never messed with majorly, so yes, its not working correctly, and yes, I hacked it, but here is what I knoe.<br /><br />With sprite 0 in zelda, its only initiated by initiating a screen scroll. $200-$203 gets changed to insert a bomb sprite to aopear underneath the bg blue sprite under the hud. Once the screen scroll has ended, $200-$203 shuts off, meaning its disabled.<br /><br />What I dont understand, is why the custom irq im using is failing at a certain point, I dont understand. <br /><br />I pasted at the very start of this thread, exactly where I inserted my code, what the pointers are at the end of the hw bank.<br /><br />I dont understand your terminology, I just want to know if my code is correct or not, and if someone could give me tge answer, not to be told I should know what im doing before I do ir. I tried many times on my oen to get this workong, and I dont know what to do. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" alt=":-(" title="Sad" />

I doubt it's the problem in this case, but it's definitely easy to check (the game only needs to write that register once).<br /><br />6502 in hex isn't too hard once you use it enough, I did hand asm/disasm plenty when I was ripping NSFs.
