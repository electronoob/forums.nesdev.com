Cycle-timed Y position detection (white screen, timing from sprite 0 to the hit) allows the search to be narrowed down to plus or minus about 15 scanlines. Then a binary (as opposed to linear) search reduces the number of frames needed to narrow down which object was hit.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=9">tepples</a> — Tue Jun 12, 2007 8:53 am</p><hr />

Do you need to display white boxes on black backgrounds? Why can't you just turn the sprites completely white for the moment of the shot? The player will probably go "Oh, that's just supposed to be the flash of the gun or something." So it wouldn't look so bad. I wouldn't keep raycasting, I'd just stop for a frame, and use that frame to check for a hit. <br /><br />And would it be bad to just check if the trigger is pulled at the beggining of a frame rather than for every scanline while raycasting? I doubt someone will pull the trigger mid-frame, and let go before the beggining of the next frame. And when I say check at the beggining of a frame, I mean check to see whether or not you are going to dedicate that frame to checking for zapper hits. I think it would be good. <br /><br />It would be better to have the gun, because in games like Doom, where the enemy was on a different elevation than you, you couldn't aim up or down, you could just aim left and right, which I think is very limited. I don't know if you are planning to have more a more 3D variation on raycasting that allows for stairs or anything like that, but if you are, the gun would be a good way to go.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=138">Celius</a> — Sat Jun 09, 2007 12:31 am</p><hr />

For my raycaster that I'll make some day (I need to get a few more things together), I was thinking that the player would move with the controller, and shoot with the gun. All you would really do with the controller is move, so you could hold that in one hand, and hold the gun in the other. I think it would be cool if it could be pulled off correctly. It would be somewhat of a programming nightmare to have to count scanlines along with the raycasting.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=138">Celius</a> — Fri Jun 08, 2007 8:23 pm</p><hr />

i was playing call of duty 3 on the wii and i got to thinking i could use the joypad/zapper combo a lot like the wiimote/nunchuck. i couldn't really come up with a good idea for that other than a fps, so a 2 player shoot-em up seemed more practical. though with a 4-score, 2 joypads, and 2 zappers i might be able come up with something cool. i definately would need a dev-cart for that so i could constantly test it on the hardware.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=187">never-obsolete</a> — Fri Jun 08, 2007 4:29 pm</p><hr />

Yeah, I always thought it was only one at a time... Oh well! That's cool that you can do that.<br /><br />I think it would also be cool to have a 2 player light gun game. But I think it would be really cool to have a game where you use the controller most of the time, but then there'll be a part where you can use two light guns. It would be cool if there was a 3Dish game where you were on a space ship, while the computer was piloting, you could be the gunner.
