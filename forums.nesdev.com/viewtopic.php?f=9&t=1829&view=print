<br />
<br />I'm still hard at work on my Playchoice adapter project.  My design uses two boards:  one connects to the playchoice motherboard (inside the cage) and the other contains the NES/Fami cart slots and sits outside the cage.  They're connected by standard 40-pin IDE cables.
<br />
<br />The bad news is that while I've gotten the Playchoice to detect the games and even start them, they're unstable.  <a href="http://twinbee.dyndns.org:1032/pub/pc10status2.jpg" class="postlink">Graphical glitches</a>, jumpy sprites, and crashes are common.  After checking both boards for cold joints (this's my first major soldering project) I'm starting to wonder if the cables themselves are the problem.  I've tried lengths as long as 24" and as short as 9" (two adjacent connectors on an 18" cable, and yes, I know about reflection) and it seems like the shorter lengths are less glitchy, but I'm not sure.
<br />
<br /><em>Edit</em>: <a href="http://twinbee.dyndns.org:1032/pub/pc10.mpg" class="postlink">Brief video of the adapter in action</a>.  Note the sprite errors. (Look carefully at Mario and you'll see stray pixels that aren't just MPEG artifacts.  Additionally, look at the upper-left turtle immediately after it turns to the left; the sprite changes.)
<br />
<br />Has anybody ever had occasion to separate a NES cart from the console and connect them with ribbon cables, and what was the maximum length that worked?  Thanks.

<br />Oddly enough, by putting 470 ohm resistors in series on the PRG data lines (D0-7), and the ROM, it fixed my problems.

<br />Hmm...that's an intereting idea.  You didn't have to do anything to the CHR?  It looks like I'm having problems with that as well, such as flicker in some tile rows.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Well, I have made (and am working on another) portable nintendo handheld type thing, and I did notice that sometimes ribbon cables have spotty connection just because they are crimp on connections. I do know you can make it almost as long as you want, but you would need to go about 100 feet or more before anything would probably start to screw up because of that. The length is surely not the issue here. The messing up of sprites is common on faulty NES connectors, make sure you clean both the connectors and carts and make sure your ribbon cables are not bad. Trust me, I have crimped some of my own ribbon cables for projects, and I often mess it up the first time and need to fix it. BTW, good luck with the PC10 project, I hope it goes well.
