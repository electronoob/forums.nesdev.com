All Famicom's are top loading. The model with dogbone controllers is the AV Famicom I was talking about which is missing the microphone, which is even required by some games, so not the &quot;definitive&quot; version at all IMHO, although it is a very popular model. I prefer an AV-moded red &amp; white Famicom (just not too old or it will be missing the looped noise feature which is a must).<br /><br />The RGB-mod also have some incompatibilities so I'm very suspicious towards that as well.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=6013">Pokun</a> — Tue Apr 02, 2019 11:46 am</p><hr />

Most of the sales comes from collectors, aka the people who get mad when a game they own gets a reprint.

I've modified a USA toploader in order to get AV out, it's quite easy to do. This has become useless since I then bought a top loading Famicom anyway, which is the &quot;definitive&quot; version of the console in many ways : Compatible with western controllers but also dogbone controllers, has SNES-compatible output, and is really pretty design. Since my USA toploader has become basically useless I could even consider selling it.<br /><br />I'm surprised toloader would be cheaper, normally it should be the opposite, not only the design is prettier but also does not come with the connector issues the fronloader has. The fronloader is much more common too.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=38">Bregalad</a> — Tue Apr 02, 2019 7:59 am</p><hr />

I'm surprised you're able to get a top loader cheaper. It's absolutely the preferred model, but the downside is of course than at least a composite video mod is a must. But then again, you could easily argue than an RGB mod is a must for both models.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=7819">Sumez</a> — Tue Apr 02, 2019 6:25 am</p><hr />

Yeah my impression is that there's a combination of multiple things at work here.<br />First of all, as everyone mentioned, once your first batch sells out, any additional interest would usually be a cart here and there, and very rarely a continuous flow of shipped products, so producing more than the initial batch might be a lot of extra work, with little actual purpose.<br />Meanwhile a game like Battle Kid never dropped out of production, which I assume is due to the interest in it having been pretty consistent.<br /><br />On top of that, once you are in aforementioned situation and haven't sold any carts since the initial batch, it would be logical to assume that you could produce new batches a few years later down the line. And while this isn't unlikely, and it's definitely happened before, we now have the silly issue of collectability to consider.<br />If only 200 carts were sold originally, and none have been sold since, it's likely that used copies will trade hands for a decent amount of money that might even be higher than the original going price. And in some cases quite a bit higher, too.<br /><br />While most people really aren't obliged to take this aspect into account, it might still be considered a good idea to try to stay on the good side of people who actually bought your product in the first place.      And if you actually originally announced that only 200 copies would be sold, making more batches later on would definitely hurt your credibility as both a developer and a person.<br /><br />All that said, I see absolutely no reason why people wouldn't be selling the ROM image on the side. Have some more people actually try your game.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=7819">Sumez</a> — Tue Apr 02, 2019 3:18 am</p><hr />

Then there's also that about expansion audio mods working differently on the top loader. And there was the unofficial device ENIO that uses the expansion port, but I'm not sure if it's being sold anymore. Also a keyboard+mouse adapter like <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/viewtopic.php?f=9&amp;t=16363&amp;start=30#p211153" class="postlink">this</a> would probably also need the NES expansion port if it was built.<br /><br />The AV Famicom is also an inferior model as it's missing the microphone. It has NES-style controller ports but you need to mod them to support some NES accessories like the Zapper and paddles as it's missing some pins.<br /><br />If I get a NES someday it will be a SCN PAL original front loader and maybe a Blinking Light Win.

Sales come in a hockey-stick shaped graph. A few months after release they're down to practically nothing. There's very little money to be made after the first run.<br /><br />Printing is cheapest in bulk. Most printers will charge you through the nose if you only want to print a few copies.<br /><br />ROMs are withheld because doing so can dissuade people from buying your future games.

It's sort of like the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osborne_effect" class="postlink">Osborne effect</a>.<br /><br />With that said, I'm sure it's viable to keep games for sale as long as they're cartridge-only and no box.

It has come to my attention after a discussion on NESdev Discord that several NES homebrew games have been produced on cartridge in small quantities and then discontinued without a ROM release. Examples include <em>Super Russian Roulette</em> (whose &quot;Get a copy here&quot; button on its <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/batslyadams/super-russian-roulette-a-new-party-game-for-the-ne" class="postlink">Kickstarter campaign page</a> just redirects back to Kickstarter) and a bunch of KHan Games releases. <em>Spook-O-Tron</em> appears not to have been made available at all other than to Kickstarter backers.<br /><br />Why are NES homebrew games taken out of print? It's not like there are minimum order quantities and long lead times for a second printing, as they're produced with CPLD mappers and flash memory, not ASIC mappers and mask ROM. One can just flash on another game using the same mapper or another mapper that the board supports, as with print-on-demand. I know things like <em>Tetris</em>, movie tie-in games, and league-based sports games get <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nsZYaK343cY" class="postlink">pulled when licenses expire</a>. But last I checked, the vast majority of NES cart releases weren't produced in nearly enough quantity to even qualify for an opportunity to license something from an upstream licensor.<br /><br />If games are discontinued because replicating them has become too expensive or too time-consuming, why is a ROM withheld? If a developer is no longer selling copies of a particular game, what measurable financial impact would mass copying of the game have on the developer? If it has to do with sales years later, I don't think NES homebrew has been around long enough for a counterpart to Buena Vista's &quot;vault&quot; strategy, where a movie is rereleased on home video every seven years and then put on moratorium in order to pump up the perceived resale value. Have developers produced extra cartridges in small quantities to subtly trickle onto eBay once a game becomes a collector's item? Or is it that providers of shopping cart software as a service bill sellers per available SKU?<br /><br />Or would NintendoAge forums be a better venue for this question?<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=9">tepples</a> — Sat Mar 30, 2019 1:29 pm</p><hr />

Personally I prefer the original. It looks nicer and has more features as rainwarrior mentioned. The downside is you have to clean your carts and connector to not have issues getting the games to boot. Once cleaned it usually works fine. I even modded my original connector to have less grip on the cartridge so as to make insertion easier and having less wear on the cartridges. Works fine and boots almost every time as long as the carts are cleaned with a magic eraser and/or isopropanol alcohol.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=9488">pwnskar</a> — Sat Mar 30, 2019 9:10 am</p><hr />

The original NES has composite output, which will have better quality and hook up to a modern TV more easily.<br /><br />The top loader only has RF output, which will connect to channel 3 through your TV's cable input. This has muffled sound, and may be a bit of a pain to set up with a modern TV.<br /><br />There was an AV Famicom top loader with composite output, but it was a rare Japanese exclusive thing.<br /><br />You could mod the top loader for composite output (just like a non-AV Famicom can be). There are also RGB and HDMI output mods that can be installed, at which point it wouldn't matter what the original outputs were.<br /><br /><br />The other main difference is that the top loader has no lockout chip, and a nicer slot connector. The connector on the original NES is easy to replace, though, and its lockout chip can be disabled with a very easy to perform mod. (I personally recommend the &quot;blinking light win&quot; slot connector replacement.)<br /><br /><br />More minor difference is the lack of an expansion port on the bottom, but no games ever used this. Some homebrew might someday, but it's a little pie in the sky.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=5165">rainwarrior</a> — Fri Mar 29, 2019 9:24 pm</p><hr />

I am thinking of getting an original NES and I noticed there's two versions...<br /><br />The top loader is normally slightly cheaper on ebay although not always...<br /><br />basically I'm not 100% clear on whether the differences are acute for anything other than method and I didn't see<br />a discussion on this topic here so I thought I'd start a topic...<br /><br />Basically I'm leaning towards whichever is cheaper wondering if there's any serious issue with that idea.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=13775">Senphiroth1134</a> — Fri Mar 29, 2019 9:13 pm</p><hr />
