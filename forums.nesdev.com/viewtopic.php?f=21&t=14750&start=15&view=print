Almost like a mockup you'd see today on PixelJoint.

For whatever reason, excessive gradients and that shiny, &quot;chrome&quot; look are extremely prevalent in lots of European games during the 16-bit era.  It was just an art style that was &quot;in&quot; at the time.

	</div><br />(I probably could have made mine look better, like if I darkened the darkest color to separate it, but I decided I'd keep all the same colors. Trying to make the middle color fit right was a pain.)<br /><br />If you ask me, European pixel art looks like you had pillow shading to where every color is the darker one in a smaller size, but instead of being dead center in the middle of the object, it's just been translated across the x and y axis slightly. it's like they have to have it where the side of everything is just about the full gradient, in that you'll never see white paired next to black unless the object was a Zebra. If you ask me, it's like the old sphere where just about every shade is a perfect circle, (the same as the whole thing except smaller) when I don't think it makes sense to be that way. That was actually an excellent demonstration, DragonDePlatino.<br /><br />And about the lighting being directional in the previous pictures, it is, but only to a certain extent (there emphasize displaying every color in the gradient more, like I said earlier) and the lighting doesn't even make sense it terms of what direction it's coming from. (The second picture can't seem to make up its mind whether the light is coming from the left or right.)<br /><br />And no, I'm not a perfect pixel artist. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt=":roll:" title="Rolling Eyes" />

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I agree that if the color count starts getting high then varying outline colors can be helpful as well. Rust Bucket from nitrome is a good, clear example of this:<br /><img src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CWQ-6DcWsAAcfih.png" alt="Image" /><br /><br />The shading is clear, and clearly represents the form. In the Arne example, despite the personal appeal of its style, the final solution undeniably most clearly represents the form, by giving clear details without distractions:<br /><img src="https://androidarts.com/pixtut/Banding.gif" alt="Image" /><br /><br />...but that form's not a sphere, so what's a better way to shade a sphere? One of the things I've noticed from all of the spheres posted here (and is also evident in the Euro 'toon characters posted) is the lack of reflected light:<br /><img src="http://www.huevaluechroma.com/pics/2-1a.jpg" alt="Image" /><br /><br />From your post history, Espozo, it seems that the Metal Slug style may be your most preferred style? If so, I wouldn't blame you, it's very well done. So, let's look at how those artists handled a sphere:<br /><img src="http://files.mteegfx.com/msSphere.gif" alt="Image" /><br /><a href="http://www.spriters-resource.com/arcade/ms2/sheet/16295/" class="postlink">Source</a><br /><br />7 colors + 1 transparent, What makes it successful:<br />* Bands vary in thickness in relation to each other<br />* Bands vary in thickness in relation to themselves (tapered)<br />* Reflected light on opposite side from light source<br />* Highlight is very minimal (a single pixel)<br />* Saturation and value contrast are tightly keyed, and clearly represent the reflectiveness of the material of the orb.<br /><br />All in all, the two things that make the Metal Slug style so effective are: <br /><br />1) complete control over saturation, which is typically the number one giveaway of programmers' art on systems with palettes high enough that saturation differences are an actual option. You can tell someone there had formal training. (This is also the most evident on the low-quality Metal Slug &quot;knockoffs&quot; that occasionally flood the android market)<br />2) shading that clearly conveys the textures and details of what's being represented<br /><br />Anyway, the specific topic of discussion from the title seems to have run its course, it may be beneficial to rename the thread to broaden its topic of discussion to pixel art styles in games. There are a lot of interesting points to discuss on the evolution of styles across each system's history, regional differences, etc.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />That's really well done, actually. The window highlight is cute, gives information about the environment. The rim lighting on the right implies a secondary light source, likely internal lighting. Moreover, the exact shape of the darker shade gives very specific info about the shape of the vase. I frequently use a similar method for leaves as well.

Miyamoto had nothing to do with this version, he said. “The porting of arcade games to Famicom, we left in the hands of a different team. <span style="text-decoration: underline">In order to get the Famicom off to a good start, I was working on the rest of the software lineup.</span>”<br /> <br />While only three games were available for Famicom on its launch day, Miyamoto says the team hoped to have about 7 games available in short order. “I personally really wanted there to be a <span style="text-decoration: underline">Baseball</span> game, and so I was working on that, as well as games like <span style="text-decoration: underline">Tennis</span> and <span style="text-decoration: underline">Golf</span>.” These simple sports games aren’t listed in any of Miyamoto’s official “gameographies,” but he says he was all in on their creation: “<span style="text-decoration: underline">I was directly in charge of the character design and the game design.</span>”<br /><br />In fact, any game on the Famicom is designed around Miyamoto’s low-level specs: The 8-bit systems could only pull from a palette of 64 possible colors, and <span style="text-decoration: underline">Miyamoto helped to hand-pick which colors it would support</span>, he said.</div> (Emphasis mine)<br /><br />Most of the games in question had Miyamoto's direction with the gameplay and the character design. That's why they all have similar looking character sprites. It would not be surprising if other developers at the time were consulting him, whether directly or through inspiration or through some kind of documentation he wrote.
