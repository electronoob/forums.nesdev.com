The objects and level will be stored as explained in this post: <!-- l --><a class="postlink-local" href="http://forums.nesdev.com/viewtopic.php?f=2&amp;t=12457&amp;start=30#p144766">viewtopic.php?f=2&amp;t=12457&amp;start=30#p144766</a><!-- l --><br />It will be like Mario, but with different entity sprites and enemy sprites. Meaning no mushroom, but for example pizza or spinach (Popeye reference XD).<br />The reason is that there are no homebrew Mario games except for hacks which for me aren't homebrew.<br />I can do the game engine, but I have no idea what kind of sprites should I use or a story or anything.<br />Can you give me ideas for the look of these objects?:<br /><ul><li>Mushroom (health supply)</li><li>Fire flower (for fire powers)</li><li>Ice flower (for ice powers)</li><li>Leaf (for raccoon tail and ears or fox double-tail and ears)</li><li>Star (for invincibility and infinite power)</li><li>Goombas (I need somethings to stomp!)</li><li>Koopas &amp; shells (something kickable. SuperTux got ice block enemies for kicking because ice is slippery)</li><li>Spiny (an enemy you have to deal with with fire)</li><li>Buzzy Beetle (Shell like enemy, but you can't get rid of them by stomping or fire. Except by a pit or another shell)</li></ul><br />Also, do you have any idea of what could the player's character be? Could it be a kid, a teen, an engineer, what? What kind of a world is the place in which he/she is? Is it just Earth with wild machines? What would be the story?

Just come up with them as ideas come in. Also, you forgot to toss in coins into that list :v<br /><br />Maybe just take <a href="http://sik.titandemo.de/supercat/" class="postlink">this old idea</a> and go with it? (oh god pre-canvas HTML games) The plot is basically &quot;you're a cat superhero&quot;.

At school, teachers ask you to do things that have been done countless times before, but you do it anyway because it's not the final product that matters, but the knowledge you acquire while making it.<br /><br />Granted, you could learn just as much, if not more, by making something that's not a 1:1 replica of something else, but creativity isn't everyone's strong suit.
