It was never officially released, but one version is included in the source of <a href="http://nesdev.com/bbs/viewtopic.php?t=7520" class="postlink">PC2NES</a>. NRPC basically just takes a list of commands that we want to run on the NES (it can be stuff like clearing memory, writing to memory or the PPU etc, or completely custom code) and generates a file that's ready to be transferred to NES where the boot ROM has to be running. Code is then executed in RAM.<br /><br />Of course this only allows running the code from RAM (2K max, or 10K if the cart has WRAM), until somebody writes some code to write to FlashROM in-system (which was exactly what blargg was doing with Munchausen).<br /><br />Long story short, I don't think there's much benefit to be had from using an alternative way.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=80">thefox</a> — Sun Mar 18, 2012 1:34 pm</p><hr />

There is a shematic on the main nesdev page.<br />The microphone simply gives '0' or '1's through controller #2 port.<br /><br />To transfer data as audio you'd have to toggle between 2 frequencies (one for '1' and the other for '0') and detect the length between 2 phase changes on the mic. If it's a "long" one, then a '1', if it's a short one then a '0' (or the other way arround).<br /><br />That's how C64 tapes works, at least.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=38">Bregalad</a> — Sun Mar 18, 2012 1:04 pm</p><hr />

My suggestion is to mimic the way the microphone is connected on the Famicom (which is the part I'm not sure is possible... I couldn't find any schematics), but instead of a microphone picking up sounds in the air the audio would be directly fed from the output of a PC (or MP3 player, CD player, whatever).<br /><br />I'm not sure how much of the sound ultimately reaches the Famicom/NES, but an input is an input, and I'm sure that we can design an audio format that is appropriate. Some volume calibration might be necessary before the actual data transfer.<br /><br />Does anyone know how the Famicom microphone works? I mean, how is it connected electronically?<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=95">tokumaru</a> — Sun Mar 18, 2012 11:12 am</p><hr />

As far as I know, the PowerPak doesn't have any competitors yet. The problem with NES Flash carts is that they have to be highly configurable, because of all the different mappers and boards that exist.<br /><br />You can easily make cheap dev carts from original carts (just replace the original ROMs with Flash ROMs or sockets), but you'd still need an EPROM programmer or a CopyNES to program the chips, which are not cheap.<br /><br />It seems there's no cheap way to run software on the NES. You could maybe make a simple Flash cart from an original cart using the mapper you need and reprogram it through the controller port (using a cable that connects to the PC), but you'd still need someone to program a boot ROM for you.<br /><br />I don't remember what the status on the controller port cable is, but I remember some members here were creating something like that.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=95">tokumaru</a> — Fri Mar 16, 2012 10:51 am</p><hr />
