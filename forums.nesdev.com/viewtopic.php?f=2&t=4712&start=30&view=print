<br />For things like Axe Knight, you could look to other sources (D&amp;D?  board games?) to see if it was used first there or in common usage now.  Or change the name a bit like Axe Murderer.
<br />
<br />In general it sounds like you are clear, and you can certainly say yours is "in the CV style" or "reminiscent of CV", without saying it is a CV game.

<br />
<br />I don't see how BROJ could remind you Circle of the Moon. The only common point is the moving fog in the background that is somewhere in COTM I guess. But it's pretty much everywhere in modern 2D games, while at the time of BROJ it should have been awesome.
<br />
<br />I agree with tokumaru that algorithm copiright does not make any sense. Altough on a full programm such a full video game, it's probably normal that the code is copyrighted, altough it's more the levels and artwork who would be bad to be copied more than the code.

In my book, which is written in first person, I talk about how "everything that's happening is so much like the video game Castlevania." So I'm making a Castlevania style game based around the events in the book. I don't know what you'd call that (partly funny, but mostly to people who will have read the book). It will be cool (hopefully) to everyone, and slightly humorous to people who read the book as well as cool.
<br />
<br />Thanks for clearing all that up guys. I'll name my enemies with common sense and I'll keep the title "ChateauLeVania". I guess I won't have trouble keeping that, since Walmart can sell soda called "Mountain Thunder" instead of "Mountain Dew", though it's clearly supposed to taste the same. And besides, though there are skeletons, werewolves, vampires, etc. the story is completely different than CV games, and it actually takes place in 2001 (in an ancient castle, however). So thanks again  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /> .

You'd have to wait 2053 so that the code falls into public domain and you can use it ?<br /></div>
<br />
<br />That falls into the category of trying to copyright a letter of the alphabet or copyright a word like Dog. You'd have to copy a sizable amount of code which can then clearly be identified as being stolen to stand much of a chance of getting in trouble. So hacking someone's game engine and selling your hack is copyright infringement. But looking at how they programmed some routine and then programming your own version, even if similar, is ok. But this is all pretty silly since no one is likely to be sued over a NES homebrew game unless it's clearly a ROM hack of a commercial game, no matter how in depth the hack may be.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Mott's covered most of this.
<br />
<br />Disclaimer: the following is pretty specific to the US, I am not a lawyer, etc.
<br />
<br />Copyright covers a particular implementation (an idea fixed in a tangible medium, such as a rom chip, hard drive, book, etc), patents cover a process or algorithm. The difference between the two is rather important -- copyright infringement requires access to the original work, if there is no access, there is no infringement; for patents, if someone has patented something, and you come up with something completely on your own that infringes, it doesn't matter if you knew about the patent or not.
<br />
<br />Going further on the copyright issues, there is a further breakdown between the source code itself, and the actual rom image. Short of getting a copy of the source code, it is *highly* unlikely that anyone would be successfully sued for copyright infringement, due to the access requirements. For the rom images, not all elements of a work are copyrightable: facts, ideas, themes, and public domain content for instance. This is part of why Nintendo cannot sue anyone who makes a platformer involving a fellow jumping around to save a princess/girlfriend/etc from some giant antagonist. In addition, trivial portions of a work do not constitute misappropriation, and thus there is no infringement.
<br />
<br />In the case of a rom image, small bits, especially ones where there is no other sane way to do something do not fall under copyright. Nor do common constructs such as loops, jump tables, etc; only the original elements. If this was not the case, every single C program ever written would infringe based on int main(int argc, char **argv) { ... }.
<br />
<br />For the US, infringement involves three things, and the burden is on the plaintiff:
<br />
<br />Proof of ownership of a valid copyright -- registration is not required, but it greatly improves one's chances of winning, and is usually required if one is looking for monetary damages.
<br />
<br />Actual Copying -- This can be either direct, or indirect. If indirect, copying is inferred via a striking similarity between the two works, combined with access and use of  the access.
<br />
<br />Misappropriation -- The elements copied have to be protectible, and the intended audience would have to recognize the substantial similarities. There are a couple approaches used here, wikipedia has more details.

<br />But it's hard to take advantage of this defense. Case law has provided plenty of avenues for copyright owners to make a judge infer access, such as if the work was widely published. See <em>Bright Tunes Music v. Harrisongs Music</em> and <em>Three Boys Music v. Michael Bolton</em> for example. It doesn't matter if you consciously knew about the copyright or not.

<br />
<br />Actually, Nintendo <strong>did</strong> sue game companies for implementing game mechanism's similar to Super Mario Bros. This was the case for 2 C64 games: <strong>The Great Giana Sisters</strong> and <strong>Hard'n'Heavy</strong>.

For little fangames that anyone could possibly muster up over any medium, I highly doubt that they'll attract such a huge mob that it actually financially disrupts any of the commercial franchises they're based on. As such, there is *no* practical issue here, and likely never will be, to the point where worrying whether or not Nintendo is going to be breaking your door down for adding the Metroid powerup system to your game seems really ridiculous. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" />
<br />
<br />That's just my opinion though.

<br />
<br />Fact is, contrary to what the other poster said, they successfully sued other companies for copying their game mechanics. But not only Nintendo, the same issue came up when Activision, license holder of R-Type, sued Rainbow Arts over Katakis, also a game with similar mechanics. So in theory, it's not as simple as many people would like it to be.
<br />
<br />The high probability that Nintendo won't sue any homebrew developer or seller is in no way a guarantee that what you do is legal. Just look at the NWC 1990 copies being made, which is a most blatant violation of copyright.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I agree with 6502freak above. Just because something bad CAN happen, is no indication that it will. I was TERRIFIED to release my clone for the longest time, until I realized the people I infringed upon would probably not even notice my game existed. Know what you're doing is illegal, certainly know the worst case scenario (getting sued), but if none of that scares you enough to deter you from making a clone/fan game (it should at least make you think twice about it), go on ahead.
<br />
<br />If you decide to go on ahead, you should still look into how "cool" the company is gonna be with your game existing. If there are any incidents you can find of other fan game creators getting a cease and desist or finding themselves in legal trouble making a game that infringes on the rights of the same game or series you're planning on making, then make sure you weigh that into your decision. If other similar fan games exist, and nothing has happened to them you should feel a little safer. This doesn't mean you can't be the first, only that I believe it's less likely. 
<br />
<br />
<br />Short version: The absolute worst that can happen is getting sued. It is up to the creator of the fan game to decide how likely this case is, and if they should go on ahead with the distribution of the game. It is my <em>opinion</em> that most likely nothing will happen depending on which company's rights you're infringing upon, but it is a <em>fact</em> that the rights holders ALWAYS have the option of taking the fan game creator to court. It is the fan game creator who's on the line, and so they must make the judgment as to whether or not they can accept that possibility. 
<br />
<br />Edit: And in case the company in question sees this post, and take it the wrong way, I have to say that I am now and have always been perfectly willing to stop distribution of my game.
<br />
<br />Edit2: Rewording. Blargg makes a good point. These edits are the best compromise I can make, since I do not want the post to read as if nothing can EVER happen, but neither do I want it to read as though I personally believe it's likely. I hope I've achieved this in my post. If I haven't, let me know.

<br />I just want to note that "absolute worst" is the absolute worst that can happen. That would be Nintendo nuking you from orbit (since <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0090605/quotes#qt0424740" class="postlink">it's the only way to be sure</a>). What you describe is not the absolute worst. Merely getting a cease-and-desist would be about the best outcome, aside from not getting bothered. Sure, it means your game has to have those elements removed, but you lose nothing aside from the time you wasted incorporating copyrighted elements into your game.
