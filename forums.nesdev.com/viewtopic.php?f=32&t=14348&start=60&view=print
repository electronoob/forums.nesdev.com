		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I'm specially impressed by the number of scrolling platformers in comparison to single screen games, which used to dominate the homebrew scene a while ago. Not to take away from single screen games, they can certainly be innovative and addicting if done right, but technically speaking, it's nice to see that more and more developers are getting out of the &quot;NES comfort zone&quot; and making games that make better use of the hardware.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I was a bit suspicious of the entry Spacey McRacey, due to similarities to my example game Spacy Shooty. But, after reviewing it's code and graphics...it appears to not have used any of my code or graphics from that game. In fact, this may just be a coincidence. I wouldn't have been angry, BTW, just would have docked you points for unoriginality...IF you had just copied and recycled my game, which you clearly did not.<br /><br />So, for anyone out there with the same suspicions, Spacey McRacey seems to be a completely original game.

I discovered your Spacy Shooty after I had settled on a name.  It's an original game (originally I had planned for it to be an Atari 2600 game, which would have pushed that hardware pretty hard being 4-playered, but I wimped out and did it as a NES game).  It was a party-game idea I've had floating around in my head for a year or so.  It didn't end up being quite as much fun as I'd hoped, but I was happy that I got it done at least.  <br /><br />I didn't post much progress about it here, but there's <a href="http://www.bitethechili.com/spaceymcracey/" class="postlink">info about it on my website</a>.

Or is it just to gain 256KByte of CHR-ROM?  Assuming we use hardware similar to years past, we'll need it to be compatible with mapper 28 to support publishing on the cartridge.<br /><br />Based on us having somewhere on the order of 600-700KByte of PRG-ROM for the category 1 entries alone, we might be forced to target 3v 1MByte+ memories anyway.  If that's the case we'll have much more than 32/36 macrocells to spare, meaning we won't really be restricted to mapper 28.  Depends on what kind of magic Tepples and enrants are able to pull to condense code banks and compress CHR.<br /><br />I've got some different ideas on the cartridge hardware that might make trying to fit within 512KByte more hassle than it's worth.  But I need some more time to evaluate that front.  So as Tepples mentioned we can just focus on completion of judging for now.  Once results are posted we can start focusing on the cartridge.
