		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I can't believe it's been almost 3 years since I've looked at this project!  I finally got off my tail and started on it.  Here's where I'm at:
<br />
<br /><div class="quotetitle">teaguecl wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">1. Pick a development platform.<br /></div><br />Done - I've chosen to use VHDL instead of schematic capture, and to use GHDL (<a href="http://ghdl.free.fr/" class="postlink">http://ghdl.free.fr/</a>) so that people can contribute without using proprietary or expensive tools.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">teaguecl wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">2. Pick a chip to simulate.  For example, maybe we start out with MMC1.<br />3. Create a implementation of the chip.<br /></div><br />I chose MMC1 as mentioned.  My first cut at it is available here: <a href="http://files.getdropbox.com/u/477050/nomp_mmc1_v1.zip" class="postlink">http://files.getdropbox.com/u/477050/nomp_mmc1_v1.zip</a><br />It still needs a good set of test vectors to make sure it's correct.  As far as I know it's the first and only MMC1 implementation with a open source license.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">teaguecl wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">4. Wire it up onto a MMC1 cart and watch it work.  This obviously requires a devboard, and probably a bunch of 3V to 5V conversion chips.<br /></div>
<br />This may still be a good idea, but I'm going to try a different route.  I'm going to get my design built in the Xilinx Webpack tools, and use the PowerPak dev kit to put it into my PowerPak for testing. 
<br />
<br />So at this point, I need some help in the following areas:
<br />- Code review.  This is my first VHDL design, I probably messed something up badly.  I also don't know if the design I have right now behaves like a real MMC1.  If you know VHDL I would really appreciate you downloading my code and giving me some feedback.
<br />- Test vectors.  I'd like to create a set of tests so I know for sure this thing behaves properly.  The only reliable way I know to generate these is by wiring up a MMC1 to some sort of test harness.  Can anyone help there?  If not, we'll have to create them by hand and be careful that they match the real hardware.
<br />- Get it into PowerPak devkit format on Xilinx.  I've never used xilinx before, any pointers would be great.  This is a high priority once the feedback from code review is done.
<br />- Find a home for the project.  I'm thinking sourceforge or Google Code.  Any preferences?
<br />- Anyone want to update the Makefile to work with Windows?  Currently it only supports Linux.
<br />
<br />So please download it and take a look.  You'll need to install GHDL and GTKWave, both available for Linux and Windows. 
<br />To build on Linux:
<br />make
<br />gtkwave mmc1_tb.vcd
<br />
<br />To build on Windows:
<br />&lt;make sure ghdl.exe is in your %PATH%&gt;
<br />make.bat
<br />gtkwave.exe mmc1_tb.vcd
<br />
<br />You should end up with something like this:
<br /><a href="http://files.getdropbox.com/u/477050/Screenshot-GTKWave%20-%20mmc1_tb.vcd.png" class="postlink">http://files.getdropbox.com/u/477050/Screenshot-GTKWave%20-%20mmc1_tb.vcd.png</a>
<br />
<br />Thanks for any help!

<br />
<br />I'd suggest you work with a fully synchronous design. Since you only have one clock input, then there isn't any good reason why you shouldn't be able to code this as a synchronous design; no gated clocks (eg "shift_clk"), no clocks in combinatorial logic (eg. "wram_ce"),
<br />
<br />All your processes should be clocked on your clock input (only). You should only be using rising_edge(clk). All other edge-detects (if indeed you need any others at all) should be done "manually" inside processes (you can use variables to reduce global namespace pollution).
<br />
<br />Your bank switching logic can be purely combinatorial - no need to go inside a process.
