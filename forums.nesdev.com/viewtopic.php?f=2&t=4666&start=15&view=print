<br />But then you can't compile multiple files at the same time, one on each core, unless this one file is structured like a makefile.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />My one compiled file is structured where everything is assigned a location. So with .DEFINE and .UNDEFINE statements where I can reuse variable names for certain parts of code, and that, I'm still not quite seeing why I wouldn't want to assemble it as one big chunk not dealing with the command line. It seems to simplify things.
<br />
<br />Another way of organizing code would be to have one file like I said, but code and data wouldn't be separated, instead, it would be one bank to one folder. So the main "bundle" file would look like:
<br />
<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">.incdir &quot;bank0&quot;<br />.include &quot;bank0include.asm&quot;<br />.incdir &quot;bank1&quot;<br />.include &quot;bank1include.asm&quot;<br />...<br /></div><br /><br />and bank0include.asm would look like:<br /><br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">.bank 0 SLOT 0<br />.orga $8000<br />.section &quot;bank0&quot; FORCE<br />.include &quot;stuff.asm&quot;<br />.incbin &quot;whatever.bin&quot;<br />...<br /></div>
<br />
<br />and so on for whatever. This might be a better setup than separating code and data because you wouldn't get "lost" when trying to find something. As long as you know what bank it's in, you're good to go.

It would be really handy if you could just specify where the following code/data begins without dealing with sections.</div>
<br />As tepples said, there's <strong>.align</strong>.   Some assemblers have a <strong>.pad</strong> directive, which pads the rom up to a specified address.
<br />
<br />FWIW, I write my 6502 code just like you describe, one organizing file with a bunch of .includes, and smaller sections in their own .asm files.  Banks are handled sorta like this... 
<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">.base $8000<br />.include bank0.asm<br />.align $2000<br /><br />.base $8000<br />.include bank1.asm<br />.align $2000<br /><br />.base $a000<br />.include bank2.asm<br />.align $2000<br /><br />...etc<br /></div>

I might reorganize my code to have a folder for each bank, with one include file. Though this could get ugly as I have 32 banks to deal will (512k PRG), but I suppose if I am viewing in icon mode instead of tile mode (I use Windows XP), it shouldn't look so cluttered and uninviting.
<br />
<br />Also, I notice you do .Align $2000. What's $2000 for? What exactly does that do?

<br />It makes each bank take up 8kB. Just a different way of doing things, without creating sections.

<br />
<br />This is different because it just links it normally, and you copy it to the ORG location yourself in your program.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />For copying code to RAM, you could just assemble code telling the compiler that the starting address of the bank is $6000 (for SRAM) or $500 depending on wherever you want the labels to be. So you assemble that peice by itself so it turns it into a binary file, then you have that incbined into a particular location in ROM to copy to RAM. Oh, and that way you can really reuse names for variables because it's completely different asm file. But it's not so good if you jump to a location in ROM afterwards. But the ways to resolve this issue don't match up to the simplicity of your method.
<br />
<br />I think someday I might look into CA65. I just used WLA-DX because it had more common features that NESASM was lacking (this statement is not meant to cause a branch in discussion to "how bad" people think NESASM is).

<br />You'd want to have each subroutine or group of subroutine to have their own section. There is no point in having large piece of code taking up a large section, unless you really want it to be in the same order in your code and in the final binary file and there is no reason you'd want that. Exept for the sound code I place in a large section so that it's easy to crease a .nsf file.
<br />If I would place it into many small section, the sound code would be shaterred in pieces in the large ROM, and it would be harder to make a .nsf file (I would basically have to take the ROM as a whole for the .nsf file, which would be a waste).
<br />
<br />I use RAM code only once for a routine that maze sprites, so that it mazes them in either increasing or decreasing order, and only a few instruction has to be modified. I could do it all in ROM by placing a switch for two different routines, but it would waste more ROM I guess.
<br />Altough WLA has almost no provisions for relocatable codes, which is lacking, I just made a RAM section with a label, and copy code into that label. When calling the routine, I use either the RAM label to enable sprite cycling, or the ROM label to disable it (if sprite priorities are needed). When modyfiyng the code, I just use RAMLabel,X, so I don't need any other labels, but that's not the clean way to do it, because if I change the code itself I have to change the routine that modifies it as well, and re-count the bytes it takes and so on...
