		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I thought it might be fun to take a quick little detour from my APU development and make a simple little input recorder for my emulator.  Then I could playback the input as my test cases so I don't always have to play the games myself.  Is there any particular way I should go about doing this?
<br />
<br />I think it would be as easy as simply watching the $4016 read/write strobes and recording data as appropriate.  I'm just talking about single player with the original joypad for right now.
<br />
<br />Any tips are appreciated!
<br />

This would not effect $4016/$4017....I'm obviously missing something.  Would you mind elaborating a bit more? <img src="./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":-D" title="Very Happy" />

<br />
<br />I got the first revision of my input recorder working!  It was so awesome to see Mario running all over the screen without me pressing a single button! LOL.  I think it's like 95% correct, but I believe that I'm running into one of these bugs because after a while of "playback" the movements get more and more off and then I die. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" alt=":(" title="Sad" />
<br />
<br />Specifically I think I am running into the $2007 bug that Disch mentioned because Super Mario Bros. doesn't use the DMC channel.  I will need to iron out this bug - still, I'm very excited! <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />

<br />Pz!

<br />When Disch said that the "Same thing happens on $2007 read" he didn't mean that $2007 reads clock the controller, he meant that if a DMC fetch and a $2007 read occur at the same time the VRAM address may be incremented twice (which has nothing to do with the controllers). So I don't think this is the problem.

I wasn't properly saving every last bit of the APU state in early versions of my emulator and that led to a lot of heartache down the line with movie files.

<br />Ohhh, I see now.  I was confused then.  Thanks for the clarification!  Well, that kind of really stinks then because it must be something else.  Haha.  I don't see how I could be missing any bits in my recorder.  Hmmm....I have a feeling this one is not going to be fun to debug!  :-/  Haha.

<br />Nope, I'm not emulating the controller, I'm recording the raw controller input directly from an original joypad connected to my dev board.

<br />
<br />That's a reasonable solution.  I'm kind of already doing that, but not in quite the same way you are.
<br />
<br />I actually just discovered something _very_ interesting.  When I playback the same sample 2 or more times in a row the playback gets screwed up in different places!  Sometimes it will get messed up 1/4 of the way through the game, sometimes it'll mess up 3/4 of the way and sometimes it makes it all the way through the level. (Note the 1/4 and 3/4 are not exact numbers, just examples).
<br />
<br />So this leads me more to believe that the recording aspect is working well but there is something wrong with the playback mechanism.  This should be easier to debug than the external joypad interface.
