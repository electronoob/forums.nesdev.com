		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I have been doing some research on the pinouts on the internal drive on the fds. I have noticed some similarities to the 3.5" floppy drive for a pc. Would it be possible to replace the internal drive with a 3.5" drive with 3.5" floppies? From what I would see is that you would have to make a connector or hard wire the drive in the fds. I haven't found any information on if itâ€™s possible or if anybody has tried. So I guess I am looking for some feedback on the idea.

That and some extensive harware modifications.  Good luck. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" />
<br />
<br />Of course, if you make a FDSLoader cable, you are doing exactly that, in a way, sort of.  A bit bulkier than just throwing a floppy in though, of course.

<br />And it still wouldn't work for games that access the disk directly instead of using the BIOS, possibly for copy authentication. (What percent of games are those again?) Otherwise, someone would have probably rewritten the BIOS a long time ago.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I don't believe that many games do any low level disk stuff themselves. I just think that it would be quite a task to write your own BIOS, make your own RAM adapter, etc. First off you can't replace the BIOS in the RAM adapter cause it's not a ROM chip, it's built into some other chip. I'm sure there is a slew of hardware issues to work out to use a floppy drive instead. You'd be better off making your own original NES Disk System that loaded game files similarly to the FDS but from 3.5" floppy disks. Besides that way you could make your system much better by having more RAM, like 128K or more PRG and 64K or more CHR allowing you to have banking abilities that many games using CHR-ROM had. But you'd have to do all this cheaply if you want anyone interested in buying it. And ofcourse then you need software, so you'll have to make good games or hack alot of licensed games. In the end it's just not worth it.
<br />
<br />I base my opinion that not many games do low level access because simply HLEing LoadFiles() from the FDS Bios makes most FDS games work on my emulator. I didn't ever add any low level drive emulation. Wasn't interested in all that work.

<br />Man, that's a bummer.  Can't this be emulated in hardware in a similar fashion to the way he did the mappers in the PowerPak?

Also how many DAC bits are necessary to support the existing sound chips? I'm not sure either if there's enough logic left over for some of the big sound chips.
<br />
<br /><img src="http://img293.imageshack.us/img293/3048/ppakbf4.png" alt="Image" />
<br />
<br />I think it would be OK to distribute a program to patch the official BIOS and join it with a FDS ROM for use with a mapper on the PowerPak.

You toggle a bit at rates in the hundreds of kilohertz, and then you run the output through a low-pass filter circuit. It's called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulse-density_modulation" class="postlink">pulse-density modulation</a>, and all SACD players use it.

I've never tried to implement MMC5, so I'm not sure how much logic is left over after that with the Game Genie etc, maybe there's plenty.

<br />Rig up a very small Mini-ITX motherboard (or smaller, if you can manage it-- like those ISA cards that contained a tiny Pentium or 486/etc. PC), and power it from the FC supply (you'll need to replace the brick with something with a lot more current, I imagine).
<br />
<br />Hardwire the DB25 Parallel Port header to the FDS drive controller IC as specified by FDSLOADR. Attach your floppy drive. Make a standard format for all your disks so that they are bootable to DOS and automatically run FDSLOADR on startup.
<br />
<br />It's a little wacky, but I'd love to see it.
<br />
<br />I'm working on the reverse of this project; building an internal PC FDS drive from an FDS drive unit, wired internally to the motherboard's DB25 header. Wish me luck.

Give it a 7-segment, a few buttons and a SD card slot and you have a complete FDS emulating system, but one that still relies on Nintendo parts.
<br />
<br />I'd rather see the PowerPak thing though, no more loading or disk errors or new hardware to be built unless you want expansion audio.
