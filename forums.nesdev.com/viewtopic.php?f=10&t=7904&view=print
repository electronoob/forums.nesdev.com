		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Hey guys, I'm wanting to get an enhanced Metroid reproduction made based off of three Metroid ips patches stacked up. I have two of them, but I need some help finding the third. 
<br />
<br />The first ips is MDbtroid found at <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://metroid-database.com/fanapps.php">http://metroid-database.com/fanapps.php</a><!-- m -->. This patch changes the general sprites of Samus, Kraid, Ridley, Metroids and a few others to make them look a heck of a lot better. It's not a level hack in anyway and is just an enhancement of the original. 
<br />
<br />Then I came across this thread: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://acmlm.kafuka.org/archive2/thread.php?id=3483&amp;ppp=20&amp;page=0#67851">http://acmlm.kafuka.org/archive2/thread ... ge=0#67851</a><!-- m -->
<br />
<br />I am interested in the Auto-Map patch and the wall jumping patch. Problem is the Auto-Map and revised wall jumping links are both broken. I luckily have a Metroid ROM where someone has already applied the auto-map, and using that I was able to add in MDbtroid. 
<br />
<br />According to the thread, the wall jumping patch overrides the Auto-map patch, so there needed to be a second revision. No matter what I do though, that link seems broken for me. 
<br />
<br />Does anyone have the ips patch for the revised wall jumping patch in Metroid for NES? I'd be very grateful for any assistance. Thanks!

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />The forum post that linked that zip with both the patches said they worked together if the auto map patch was applied first. I just applied them in that order, and with a cursory check it seems to work fine. Doesn't crash when messing with the first few rooms.
<br />
<br />When the walljump patch is applied first, it resets to the title screen each time, however. Honestly, it's black magic that this works one way at all, since they occupy some of the same bytes.
<br />
<br />Now, the map patch starts $CA35. If it's 192 bytes like the readme says, it will indeed run into the wall jump patch, which starts at $CACF. (#$CA35+#191 = #$CAF4. #$CAF4-#$CACF = #25. Which means the last 26 bytes of the map patch are overwritten by the wall jump patch.) 
<br />
<br />But... neither patch seems to place itself in free space in the rom. And not knowing a lot about Metroid, I don't want to mess with them if that's not the case. So yes, up to you snarfblam!
<br />
<br />Edit: And... disregard all that. The map patch puts a bunch of zeros after itself. Starting at... guess where? $CACF! So the wall jump patch simply overwrites these zeroes. That's why putting them in the wrong order breaks it. Because 0s overwrite part of the wall jump patch, rather than the wall jump patch overwriting the 0s. But they should be totally safe to use together with no additional problems if they're patched in order.
<br />
<br />If anything, I'd say it's the map patch that needs to be updated to not also change more bytes than it needs to, not the wall jump patch.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />qbradq: yeah, I looked for free space in the manner of strings of FFs. I only found one, possibly two spots that were large enough for the wall jump patch, but they were quite possibly in an entirely different bank. I don't know a lot about mappers so...  For all I know there's a giant set of unused data and functions around $1CA?? that can be safely overwritten, but Metroid looks pretty free of large repeating byte strings.
<br />
<br />Edit: MDbtroid? I totally forgot about that one. If it's graphics only, it shouldn't affect anything, but I guess I'll check.
<br />
<br />Edit2: Again, a cursory check reveals no problems. The area where the map patch and walljump patch reside aren't affected. MDbtroid adds bytes to the end of the rom. If it only adds to the end of the rom, you could patch with it first, second, or third. If it adds bytes someplace else, I'd save it for third because that would affect the offsets the other two patches expect.
<br />
<br />My order:
<br />1. Automap
<br />2. Wall Jump
<br />3. MDbtroid
<br />
<br />BTW, I guess now is a good time to plug this program: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.scootersoftware.com/">http://www.scootersoftware.com/</a><!-- m --> It makes finding the differences in similar files a total breeze. It's great for extracting hacks, and finding what areas they affect without going through the IPS file manually.
