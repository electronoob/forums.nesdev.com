If no one wants them, no big deal either way.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Hey,<br /><br />I agree with above a TSOP is alot less work to solder to a board, and there are millions of them out there.<br /><br />For me it takes about less then 3 minutes to fully solder a TSOP to a board with pin headers.<br /><br />Its not that hard i think its just how you tackle it, drown it in flux use a correct tip and have a good wick handy for mistakes.<br />And i have always found a x10 glass with light in it is perfect for small jobs, use the drag method aswell <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />I believe the only issue with the TSOP is the programming of them,<br /><br />However your design is nice but how much does it cost to make a game like that but?

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I'm on board with the &quot;TSOPs aren't that bad&quot; crowd.  Really, all it takes is practice.  I started out barely able to solder wire-to-board for audio projects and just decided one day that I wanted to try surface mount, so I bought some parts and started practicing.  Sure, I wrecked a few chips early on, but that was my fault for STARTING with 0.5mm pitch TSOPs.  Get some 1.27mm SOICs or something.  You can get 7400-series chips for next to nothing.  Solder them down, then pull them off, then do it again.  Then move on to something smaller.  All it takes is practice.  Of course, a good iron/tip never hurts, but I did just fine with the piece of crap I used to own, it just made me appreciate my nice one when I got it.  Also, get good 60/40 (or my favorite, 62/36/2) solder, forget the lead-free junk.<br /><br />Another thing, for games less than 32Mbit, Micron still produces 5V Flash ROMs in 8Mbit and 16Mbit sizes.  M29F160's sell for ~$3.  Most distributors will list them as out of stock, but really they're just a &quot;non-stocked&quot; item, meaning they have to order them from Micron, and don't keep stock on hand.  Avnet has them in stock though.  That's what I used for my Zelda: Parallel Worlds cart.
