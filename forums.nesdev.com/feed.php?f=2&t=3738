What you describe is certainely possible, however I'm not sure it's possible with the power pak (I'm not sure how it's wired anyway).<br /><br />What you need is to have tri-state buffers between the PPU adress AND control bus and the CHR-RAM. Then the mapper could force the PPU to become tri-state (trough the tristate buffer), and highhack all dummy reads to take advantage of this time to write to CHRRAM.<br />However, in VBlank, the PPU line is not tristate, /RD and /WR are normally high. $2006 contol more or less directly the adress but, and whenever the CPU reads or write $2007, /RD and /WR respectively will imediately go low (exept if the adress is in $3f00-$3fff range). The data bus should always be high-Z exept when writing.<br />So if you're sure the PPU is only reading, you could highhack the /WR line to low (with a multiplexer or something), highhack the adress bus, and write your stuff. Having part of the adress controlled with $2006 is possible during VBlank, I doubt it's possible during HBlank.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=38">Bregalad</a> — Sun Dec 02, 2007 2:16 am</p><hr />

I assume you are referring to FRAM...I checked the schematics and it appears that it's clocked by "nesclk".  However, it's really strange, because for the symbol definition and schematics for FRAM, the clock is labeled "m2", but "nesclk" is being fed into "m2" for the FRAM symbol...but either way, I think it uses one of the NES's clocks and not a PowerPak internal clock.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3329">strangenesfreak</a> — Sat Dec 01, 2007 4:54 pm</p><hr />

Technically, the FPGA connects to 13 bits, but not in the way to support 8KB, though - bits A10-A18 are missing and supposedly utilizes the PPU's bus on the PCB.<br /><br />I do have a question regarding a few of the CHR RAM pins that <em>are</em> connected to the FPGA - <br /><br />Why are pins A0-A2 and A10-A11 pretty weird?  I can sort of understand about A10 - based on how it's connected to "crama10" it seems to be involved in the NES bus's CIRAM A10 signal.  But A11 is connected to "crama11" - where does this come from?  I do sort of understand A0-A2; I think they're buffers from the PPU bus in addition to A10-A18 on the PCB.  I am still curious why only these pins (A0-A2 and A10-A11) are clocked off of the NES's main CLK, while the others available on the FPGA (A12-A18) aren't.<br /><br /><br />It also seems to look like we're only talking about FIFO-DMA - what about the pseudo-HDMA?  Is that possible?  If that needs to be clarified better:<br /><br /><strong>Pseudo-HDMA:</strong>  The goal of this is to allow bytes from memory being accessed by the PPU to be transfered during rendered scanlines - similar to the SNES's HDMA.  Because of the problems with CHR RAM address lines, this will only concern VRAM within the FPGA.<br /><br />The concept of this is based on how there are 18 garbage nametable reads (36 PPU cycles) and 1 resting PPU cycle per scanline.  Therefore, writes accessing even FPGA-VRAM can be made during those 36 PPU cycles.<br /><br />For NESes only, there are at most 148 bytes that can be transfered per scanline.  This is because the NES has the NES_CLK available on the cart bus - since that is 4 times faster than the PPU's clock, that would allow for 4 bytes per PPU cycle - with 37 PPU cycles, that would mean 148 bytes.<br /><br />However, unless you use some NES-to-Fami converter that happened to have the NES_CLK crystal, this would not work with Famicoms because they don't have NES_CLK.  That would reduce the maximum number of bytes per scanline to 18 bytes per scanline - Famicom carts can still clock off the PPU /RD signal to keep track of the garbage memory accesses - but it cannot track down the resting cycle.<br /><br />There would be a timer clocked off from - either NES_CLK (for NESes only) or PPU /RD.  To determine what to clock off from, the mapper will watch $2002 reads for the VBlank bit to be set.  Once it sees it set ASAP, it can start clocking off its timer to sync with the PPU.<br /><br />The bytes to read off would be from extra RAM internal to the FPGA (not FRAM).  There would be 4 scanline entries for each transfer - an entry per scanline wouldn't fit in the 2KB.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3329">strangenesfreak</a> — Sat Dec 01, 2007 2:47 pm</p><hr />

The problem is on the NES' side, not the PowerPak<br /><br />Even with address trickery you can't use the FPGA to much extent without reworking since since 13 bits are necessary to address 8KiB and the FPGA only connects to 9 bits. To control the low bits, you'll always have to use $2006 unless you want to add more A lines to the FPGA and fight the PPU.<br /><br />If you're going to rework the PCB, you could put a tri-states on the A and D bus between the CHR RAM and NES. If you connected up the rest of the A lines to the FPGA too you could do almost anything :D I dunno where you'll find the I/O though.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=20">kyuusaku</a> — Sat Dec 01, 2007 1:21 pm</p><hr />

Since you can't freely control the address lines with the PPU driving them it won't work :( It's a shame the PPU lines aren't Hi-Z since then a FIFO-DMA mapper would be possible which in many ways is even better than CPU DMA.

It's pretty good.  <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />I'll try to make my explanation much clearer:<br /><br /><br /><strong>DMA Transfers:</strong>  The goal for this is to transfer data to CHR RAM and FRAM much faster than writing manually.  The NES's own Sprite DMA register reads 256 bytes for writing to OAM in only 512 cycles.  A mapper could take advantage of this and have the register indirectly write to CHR RAM and FRAM as well.<br /><br />Some of the important components needed for this mapper include - a CPU clock timer, an address bus and data bus latcher, and extra 2KB internal RAM (hereby called XRAM).<br /><br />The mapper must watch for writes to the register - $4014 - by watching the address bus and CPU R/W signal.  Once it detects it, it will wait for the actual write to $4014 to finish.  Then, it will read off the bytes transfered by reading on every odd cycle of the transfer.  The mapper would do this by using a CPU clock timer and reading off the data bus.<br /><br />To write the byte read from the CPU, it must get the address to write to.  The mapper does this by reading off 2-byte words from XRAM.  These words determine the address written.  They also have a special format as to whether to increase the previous address or to directly set a new address.  <br /><br /><strong>Note for CHR RAM Transfers only:</strong>  Because of how the CHR RAM's address lines on the FPGA work, some of the bits must be set by PPU reg $2006 - those bits are fixed throughout the whole transfer.<br /><br />Once it gets the word, it can write to CHR RAM or FRAM by requesting a write through the address bus + data bus input + write signals of the chip.<br /><br />Of course, there would be a way to turn on or off the behavior with a simple register.  If sprite rendering is needed, the program must conserve the sprites by turning off the mapper's behavior and doing a normal sprite DMA transfer.<br /><br /><br />As for the program simply directly writing to CHR RAM as it wanted to, I think that would be a simple register set - a mapper's address register to set most of the bits, $2006 to set the other bits, and a mapper's data register.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3329">strangenesfreak</a> — Sat Dec 01, 2007 10:37 am</p><hr />

I think I understand part of your original post. If you want to do your idea justice, give it a chance to be understood by going <em>slowly</em>, first describing the goal, then how it achieves that. What I understand is that you want to increase the amount of VRAM that can be modified during vblank, using a custom mapper. You observed that a sprite DMA transfer is able to copy 256 bytes in 512 CPU clocks, something the CPU could never dream of normally. You say that during the write portion of the sprite DMA transfer, the PPU is only driving a few of the address lines, so a custom mapper could perhaps drive the other lines as it pleased, and somehow write to CHR RAM during that time. I don't really grasp the idea, since surely the entire CHR address bus is driven, and the read/write lines deasserted. I would have figured you could just have a custom mapper write to CHR RAM as it pleased during vblank, since I don't think the PPU is accessing it at all then.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=17">blargg</a> — Sat Dec 01, 2007 10:26 am</p><hr />

Sorry if I sounded too confusing - I'll try to clarify some of the ideas - but it may overall be more or less confusing  <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_confused.gif" alt=":?" title="Confused" /> :<br /><br />XRAM would theoretically be extra 2KB of RAM inside the FPGA - the FPGA the PowerPak uses can use up to 6KB of extra RAM.  FRAM only uses 4KB of that 6KB, so an extra 2KB defined in the custom mapper schematics is possible.<br /><br />For the SpriteDMA hijacks, the mapper would watch for writes to $4014 to know that SpriteDMA is about to happen - allowing the mapper to make an accurate prediction.  Based on this prediction, the mapper will take each byte read by the transfer (readable from the CPU's data bus), read a word from an address look-up table inside XRAM, and write to the address specified.  Because of how the PowerPak's CHR RAM A lines work, certain bits must be fixed for the transfers to CHR RAM.  Technically, the sprite DMA tranfers do update the sprites with irrelevant data - that's why once you're done with these special transfers, you need to do a real sprite DMA transfer.  Of course, the mapper will be told whether to or not to hijack the reads from the data bus.<br /><br />As for pseudo-HDMA, I thought of this based on the fact that there are 18 useless nametable reads in every scanline - so it doesn't really matter what the PPU is accessing during those reads.  If FRAM is used by the PPU (for nametables or extra attributes), the mapper could read from XRAM and write to the FRAM directly.<br /><br />Bregalad, I think you might be thinking that this is trying to allow the CPU to write to PPU directly or vice verca - but I intended for these ideas to have the mapper write directly to the in-cartridge chips the PPU uses - not through the PPU itself.  Although, this would not allow the mapper to write to the PPU's internal 2KB VRAM.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3329">strangenesfreak</a> — Sat Dec 01, 2007 9:34 am</p><hr />

I don't undestand all of what you are saying, however, keep in mind that CHRRRAM is only writable and readable by the PPU itself. During rendering, the PPU will read the CHRRAM (and name tables, attribute tables, etc...) via it's PPU bus, so all those devices are unacessible by the CPU and by the mapper no matter what.<br />Sprite DMA performs 256 reads on the CPU bus (not the PPU bus), and the destination is OAM and cannot be changed. Only the source can be changed.<br /><br />Pseudo-HDMA as you mention is just not possible, the only thing you can do from the cartridge slot during rendering is basically bankswitching stuff. The only possible effect is to bankswitch things automatically very fast to simulate things, or possibly to replace the CHRR ROM/RAM with other stuff that could give other graphics, etc... You could do a mapper that could count the scanlines and automatically bankswitch CHRROM at a certain point, or even midscanline (that's what the MMC5 does in fact). However you cannot change scrolling or anything by hardware, software must operate this.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=38">Bregalad</a> — Sat Dec 01, 2007 7:30 am</p><hr />
