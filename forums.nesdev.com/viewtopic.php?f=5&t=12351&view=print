		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I have read many of stories comparing the Sega Genesis to the Super Nintendo, however I haven't really head of comparing upgraded versions of these consoles. <br /><br />When comparing the hardware specs of a standard Genesis and SNES the SNES pretty much takes the cake, but does the 32X have enough weight and does it surpass a stand alone SNES? What about the MSU1 enhancement chip for the SD2SNES? Does the SD2SNES surpass a Genesis with a 32X combined together?<br /><br />Post your thoughts and opinions regarding the upgraded versions of these consoles. What system would out preform the other given the enhancement upgrades?

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />??? If anything, the MSU-1 is more comparable to the Sega CD. That is, after all, what it was designed to go against. The thing is, no matter how much extra processing power you give a system, it will always be dragged down by it's video hardware. (That's probably the main reason the Sega CD looked so terrible.) The 32x has it's own video hardware and somewhat acts as a pass-through, while the MSU-1 still uses the SNES's video hardware. I agree with psychopathicteen when he said Nintendo should have made a buss that went strait from the cartridge slot to the PPU's, but obviously, they didn't.

Maybe some of the coprocessors can fill some of the gaps though (SuperFX was meant to do this for 3D rendering, for instance). And yes, the 32X can be quite a beast when used properly (see <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UxfsXDBCp3o" class="postlink">Darxide</a>: textured lit polygons... whether the gameplay lives up to it is a different matter =P).

And on NES, Neo Geo, and any handheld with a TV tuner cartridge (Game Gear, TurboExpress, Game Boy Advance), there's essentially as much video bandwidth as you'd possibly need. Super NES not so much, but it is enough to push a coprocessor-rendered 160x144x2bpp viewport to VRAM at 60 fps in Super Game Boy or a larger viewport at a slower rate in Super FX games.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />The Super Gameboy didn't actually render sprites or anything? Also, since I'm not too familiar with all these &quot;fancy&quot; terms like video bandwidth, does that what effects things like how much data you can DMA to VRAM? I remember that it has been discussed that the SNES can update 3 64x64 sprites under absolutely perfect conditions. Just thinking about it, I heard that 256x240 mode isn't very good because it takes a large amount of time away form things like updating VRAM so I got to wondering. Couldn't you actually get more time if you disable rendering for a bit and turn it back on (obviously) latter? How much time do you lose doing 256x240 mode, because if you made the display 208 pixels tall, shouldn't you gain twice as much time as you lost if the display was 240 pixels tall? Sorry if this doesn't make any sense...

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />You're correct in guessing that &quot;video memory bandwidth&quot; refers to how much data can be copied to VRAM per second or per frame. There are 341 dots in a scanline, 10 of which are reserved for WRAM refreshing. It takes the DMA unit two dots to copy one byte. Thus 262 total lines - 224 picture lines = 38 blanking lines, and 38 blanking lines * 331 dots/line / 2 dots/byte = 6289 bytes. Practically, you can probably do 6 KiB (6144 bytes). (I might be missing something related to time taken to load sprites that are displayed on the first line.) Calculations for 239, 208, and 192 lines are an exercise for the reader.<br /><br />Super Game Boy contains a coprocessor consisting of the Game Boy SoC with some glue logic to buffer scanlines on their way to the Super NES. 160x144 pixels at 2bpp is 160*144*2/8 = 5760 bytes, which comes in just under the roughly 6 KiB per frame limit for 224-line mode. Adding a full OAM DMA would appear to put it over the limit, but perhaps it performs only a partial OAM DMA. Someone who has disassembled the SGB BIOS would be able to tell you more.<br /><br />Super FX games tend to be letterboxed to allow for more bandwidth. For example, <em>Star Fox</em> is 224x192.

Video bandwidth could be the reason for the giant black bars on Final Fight 3. (Seriously, they take up about 64 pixels.) What even determines the amount of video bandwidth you get?

(I wonder how much the SuperFX 2 could push if it took shortcuts like that one?)<br /><br />On the SNES side there's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=XxCAPoeXdsQ#t=85" class="postlink">this</a> which is somewhat comparable to what the 32X was doing at least (I don't recall the framerate being that low though... oh well).

One cool thing you could do is have every pixel be a unique color when the game is creating everything, but then &quot;funnel&quot; the amount of colors down to 256 when the frame buffer is being created. If you're wondering what the purpose of this would be, it would be for novelty's sake.

Video memory bandwidth would be the limiting factor there.<br /><br />On the other hand, newer games are framed for 16:9. You could have the game render to 256x176 and letterbox the crap out of it. This gives (262-176)*331/2 = over 14000 bytes per frame. At 4bpp, the entire frame is 256*176*4/8=22528 bytes, enough to double buffer a whole 4bpp plane at 30 fps.
