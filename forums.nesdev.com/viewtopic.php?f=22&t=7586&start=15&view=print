<br />This is done by darkening the pallet once every other frame. To darken a pallet entry you subtract 16 from it. If the result is negative, set it to $0D (Black).

Like, I make a jump from a stand, and the character suddenly accelerates while in the air, before touching the ground. It is impossible to increase acceleration in jump in real life (if you don't have a jetpac), so it look and feels not natural. SMB actually has acceleration in jump too, but there it is not so noticeable, and does not feels not natual, probably because of other values of speed and acceleration.

<br />
<br />It kinds reminds me of Faxanadu without the scrolling.  I think if you're going this route that might be a good game to check and reference.

<br />
<br />$0F I think is the defacto black color.  I use it for everything black, as do most licensed games.  I can see in the PPU he is using $0D, which is the "evil" black.  So yeah, fix that.

<br />
<br />I think I know enough now to actually design a game like this. I know now that I do not want to stick to a single-screen game. I figured out that it works for Faxanadu because the platforming elements of that game are slow. It does not work for a game with fast platforming.
<br />
<br />Anyway, I just wanted you all to be able to try what I've come up with.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Not sure how I didn't notice this thread before, but it looks really good!
<br />
<br />Your first post says it's a side-scrolling game, but also says it's a flip-screen game, so I'm a little confused there.  Horizontal scrolling would look really good with this, though I guess it depends on the level design.  Having it flip is like going around blind corners on every screen, guess it depends on what's more fun to design and play.  It'd also could be easy to load areas as a 1x2 screen area by using both nametables and scroll within that, and flip to the next section.  That brings up other fun stuff like tracking off-screen enemies though (just to not to have Ninja-Gaiden style enemy respawning, at least, heheh).
<br />
<br />Looks great though.
<br />
<br />And yeah I can confirm that $0D is a bad color.  The first batch of Garage Cart #1 I built had that in the palette, I knew about that already but it creeped in somehow.  Had one person (out of, I dunno, 8) that had it not work right with their TV.  Was easy to revise the ROM, that's some real-time testing during production there, heheh.

<br />Yeah I thought the modern TVs wouldn't care about but it turns out couple of weeks ago I was playing Immortal on my PAL NES + HDTV and it glitched like hell. Quick look in Nintendulator revealed the $0D was the culprit, so I patched it in ~8 places and the problem went away.

<br />
<br /><div class="quotetitle">oRBIT2002 wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">Very nice work! But is the background graphics ripped from Zelda2? <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /></div>
<br />
<br /> <img src="./images/smilies/icon_evil.gif" alt=":evil:" title="Evil or Very Mad" /> NO!  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_evil.gif" alt=":evil:" title="Evil or Very Mad" />
<br />
<br />All of the background tiles are original. The bricks that you can stand on are very similar to Zelda II in that is uses an 8x16 masonry pattern. The darker bricks (this ones you can't stand on) use a 4x8 masonry pattern, which never appeared in Zelda II. The columns also look a lot like Zelda II, because there is only one way to really represent a flitted column lit from the left in 16 pixels.
<br />
<br />All other tiles also never appear in Zelda II. The column tops are of a different design, the drapes actually look like drapes rather than stacks of eggplant, there are recesses and stained glass windows, good looking grass, terrible looking dirt and even shaded clouds. None of these graphical elements were in Zelda II (its grass was bad and its dirt was good <img src="./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" />)
<br />
<br />But yea, that's the most frequent comment I get about the graphics. I guess it would help if I updated the screenshot <img src="./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" />
<br />
<br />Anyhow this is a work in progress. I think I've hit the technical limitations of the design before I achieved my game-play goals, but in the process I think I have learned enough to overcome those technical limitations. The next update will likely use the same graphics and 100% new code.
