Simple enough. It is most frequently used in conjunction with a BVC to simulate a forced branch (a.k.a a branch always) in relocatable routines. The 65C02 has a branch always instruction (BRA), but the 6502 does not.&quot;<br /><br />Once you are sure V is clear, you can use BVC repeatedly, as long as there are no ADC,SBC,or BIT instructions. Is 1 byte shorter than JMP<br /><br /><br />Also, I've used the V flag in signed math, but I prefer not to (unsigned math is easier). I've mostly seen it for sprite zero checking, after BIT.<br /><br />Edit - I couldn't find any example code where I used bvc or bvs for math. I retract that statement.

This is useful for ensuring an entity's position doesn't leave the bounds of the screen or map and wrap to the other side.&quot;<br /><br />It distinguishes 129 + (-2) = 127, which in this context is desirable, from 1 + (-2) = 255, which in this context needs to be clamped to 0.

I did try to implement V initially, but couldn't figure it out at that time. Plus I had no games which were exercising it anyway, and didn't feel like writing a test rom for something which I didn't know would necessarily be used. Like I said I have a lot of other things I do with my time, like making games, music, my full time job, walking for an hour every day, playing games, watching tv, etc. ggvm was something I got done over winter when I had slightly fewer things occupying my time, now I barely have any time for it. You're welcome to add support for V to the <a href="https://github.com/gradualgames/ggvm" class="postlink">github project</a> if you want to help out <img src="./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" /> It has turned out to be useful to a number of folks. That reminds me actually, I don't think I ever finished implementation of indexed indirect instructions either, I never use them and again, neither did the 10+ games I've adapted...

Haha. I don't know how many times I've tried to use<br /><br />sty blahblah,x<br /><br />thinking I could because I also did<br /><br />ldy blahblah,x<br /><br />...<br /><br />*edit* Wait, now I'm confused. Out of curiosity I checked my printed out 6502 reference. It says  zp,x is available for sty. But I'm pretty sure ca65 yells at me when I try it. Oh wait....it's ABS,x that I'm trying..that's what isn't supported.

But GGVM's sampler is completely different from the 2A03's APU anyway.<br /><br />I imagine that there are other uses of a pointer table on zero page. But 6502 coders who learned on Commodore 64 or Apple II won't have a lot of experience with it because Microsoft BASIC in ROM ate so much of zero page for itself.

Self-modifying code doesn't do that very well (requires unrolled code, altering the pointers by index no longer possible, etc.)<br /><br />tepples' canonical example for something that is convenient with a table of pointers is per-channel data streams in a music engine, and that's primarily where I've used it too.

So I may use the instruction twice in the whole game code, but that particular instruction can be executed potentially hundreds of times per frame.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">I made it pretty clear on my blog that I don't like (zp, x) mode, and don't use it.</div><br />It's up to you to like it or not, but refusing to use it in one of the rare cases where it could be handful it's not very bright.<br /><br />As for BVS/BVC, I use it <s>mainly</s> exclusively in combination with BIT, but not only with $2002. BIT is an amazing instruction when it comes to read the top two bits of any variable, I do that all the time. It's also common I have routines which returns two boolean values, one in C and one in V.
