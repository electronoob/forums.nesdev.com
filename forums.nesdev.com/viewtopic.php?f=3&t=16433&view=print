I have a title screen and there seems to be some problem with how I build it (I'm using the game's original routines for drawing it). When testing the hack on an everdrive the bottom of the screen looks garbled. But no emulator shows this. Every emulator shows a perfect title screen. Fceux is the only one that doesn't show a perfect screen, but it doesn't come close to showing the same result as NES hardware.<br /><br />Nestopia, punes (screen as it should be):<br /><img src="http://i.imgur.com/xaN2Dgr.png" alt="Image" /><br /><br />Fceux (top of the head missing):<br /><img src="http://i.imgur.com/A4rnGob.png" alt="Image" /><br /><br />Everdrive n8 running on a NES AV:<br /><img src="http://i.imgur.com/miEuZhe.jpg" alt="Image" /><br /><br />Attached to this post is a rom of just the new title screen with the bug present (no game at all). It runs in fceux (it was generated using strip data). Funny, if this is run on punes it shows the same bug as in fceux. So fceux in some way altered the game's code? Also attached is the full ips for the (U) rom.<br />I'm going to see what's going on and fix the problem, but I figured it would be a good idea to report this here.

That makes a lot of sense. So the everdrive is the culprit here then. Though it probably doesn't explain why sometimes the top of the ghost's head is missing, but I'm going to follow these instructions (which Workss didn't) and see if it solves the problem: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://wiki.nesdev.com/w/index.php/Init_code">https://wiki.nesdev.com/w/index.php/Init_code</a><!-- m --><br /><br />About higan, I looked and couldn't find an option for scrambling ram. If it exists it's in the form of command line args.

I've written a loop to replace a huge piece of code that was repeated 120 times. Not sure if they did that because it would run faster... Then I'll be able to write proper clear routines.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />In general, this technique of repeating to avoid spending cycles in branches is called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loop_unrolling" class="postlink">loop unrolling</a>. For example, my <a href="https://forums.nesdev.com/viewtopic.php?f=22&amp;t=15440" class="postlink">Popslide</a> VRAM updater includes versions that are not unrolled, unrolled by a factor of 16, and unrolled by a factor of 64, as a size/speed tradeoff.<br /><br />But just because it's unrolled doesn't mean it's efficient. I imagine that many NROM- and CNROM-era programmers lacked 6502 experience and instead literally translated idioms from their favorite assembly language to 6502, resulting in <a href="https://forums.nesdev.com/viewtopic.php?p=136941#p136941" class="postlink">inefficient code</a>. And there are a bunch of useless PPU writes in <em>Super Mario Bros.</em> and other games because programmers hadn't yet figured out how scrolling really works.<br /><br />Could you paste a short snippet of the code that has been unrolled by a factor of 120?

You have to debug this kind of change thoroughly, analyzing the entire vblank handler to know for sure the maximum amount of work the game will try to fit there.
