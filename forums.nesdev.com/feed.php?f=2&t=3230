Would you like an algorithm that performs a mod-30 operation (i.e. it takes a 16-bit input and calculates the remainder when divided by 30)?  I think this would serve your purposes, as you can use values 0-14 for one nametable and 15-29 for the other.  I have a draft of the algorithm (takes around 70 cycles to execute), but I need to test it before I can post it here.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=360">dvdmth</a> — Tue Apr 17, 2007 5:35 pm</p><hr />

I don't think there's anything "unprofessional" about this method, if commercial game developers made use of it.<br /><br />By abstracting the PPU screen coordinates from the level map coordinates, you remove all dependencies on the PPU screen size limitations.  For example, if you want your level map to wrap vertically (instead of having hard boundaries at the top and bottom), you would normally have to restrict the vertical map size to a multiple of 15 blocks.  By keeping the PPU scroll values separate from the map position, your level map can be ANY size and still wrap vertically.  Both games I mentioned have maps that wrap in both directions, and neither uses a multiple of 15 for the vertical map size (they use a power of 2 instead, which is more convenient).<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=360">dvdmth</a> — Tue Apr 17, 2007 10:52 am</p><hr />

Something that immediately comes in my mind is to divide by 16 by shifting it right 4 times, then correct the thing to be divided by 15 instead of 16 by doing some trick to multiply the result by the fraction 16/15 in some tricky way that could be done in a table. If the result is an integer, only a certain range of values would need any correction at all. I guess this is fine for small and limited range of values, but could be weird for very large numbers.<br /><br />Something else is repeated substraction by 15, but I don't think it's fast. It works fine and is easy to code and fully understand, tough.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=38">Bregalad</a> — Tue Apr 17, 2007 9:19 am</p><hr />

Just to let you guys know, I think I'll settle for this:<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">   ldx #$08<br />DivideBy240:<br />   cmp #$78<br />   bcc .Negative<br />.Positive:<br />   sbc #$78<br />.Negative:<br />   rol Result<br />   rol<br />   dex<br />   bne DivideBy240</div><br />This will divide a 16-bit number whose lower byte is in a zero page location "Result" and high byte is in A. In the end, "Result" holds (duh) the result and the remainder is in A (in my case, ready to be used as Y scroll). The 16-bit value can have a maximum value of 61439 though, more than that does not work, that's is intentional, as supporting larger values would make everything slower. That means I can have 240 256-pixels high screens vertically in my level map, and that's a lot, so this is not a problem at all.<br /><br />The worst case takes 145 cycles, not bad. When the code is unrolled this count drops down to 104, but I'm not sure if I should do that. Problem is that when I need to do this division, I also have to do some heavy map decoding, which means I should save all the time I possibly can.<br /><br />Anyway, from this result I'll know the exact spot in the name tables that correspond to a spot in my level map, which is what I wanted.<br /><br />EDIT: I don't know if I could get any extra time with this, but I just realized I will only need the lower bit of the result (to know if I sould display the top name tables or to the bottom ones, and to know where to draw metatiles), and the remainder (to use as Y scroll and to calculate the address for metatiles). I don't really need bits 1-7 of the result, but I don't think there is a way to get some speed, as the input has to be shifted anyway, and the output is shifted into it.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=95">tokumaru</a> — Mon Apr 16, 2007 9:17 pm</p><hr />

Thing is I have my level stored in the form of "screens", which <strong>must</strong> be 256x256 pixels, because of the way they are made up. My camera's coordinates are coordinates within this map, and the problem is in converting these coordinates into coordinates compatible with the name tables, that are 240 pixels high.<br /><br />I got it figured out, though. A divide by 240 with the shift-and-subtract method will be very fast (knowing that the divisor is 240 makes it possible to take many shortcuts), and I need to do this only when a new row or column of metatiles has to be drawn, which is not even every frame. So I think I'm fine. I got it all figured out now, really.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=95">tokumaru</a> — Mon Apr 16, 2007 6:24 pm</p><hr />

I wouldn't use divide-by-15 for this purpose.  Instead, have two different Y position variables, one that keeps track of where you are in the level map (absolute position) and one that keeps track of where you are in the nametables (relative position).  When you scroll vertically, adjust both the absolute and relative Y-positions at the same time.  If the relative position drops below zero or exceeds 14, then switch nametables (or wrap around in the same nametable, if you're using vertical mirroring).<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=360">dvdmth</a> — Mon Apr 16, 2007 3:46 pm</p><hr />

Does anyone know of a way to quickly divide by 15?<br /><br />I imagine there are ways to optimize division by constants, but I can't seem to think of anything that works. Ah, I need the remainder too.<br /><br />Thanks for the help!<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=95">tokumaru</a> — Mon Apr 16, 2007 2:38 pm</p><hr />
