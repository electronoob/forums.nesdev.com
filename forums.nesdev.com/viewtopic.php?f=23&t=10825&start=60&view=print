But now with a real slot I don't have timing issues anymore.<br /><br />There must be a way to use the slot still on the PCB. I don't care about the 2nd console. I could even cut it out and cut away all other PCB parts, but these soldering pins are probably much better than to solder wires manually to the slot pins. I don't know what is the pitch and if there's a board available with that.<br /><br />I don't know exactly how the slot looks like at it's bottom. There are 4 rows (2x2 each side) with shorter and longer pins. Maybe there are even hooks or holes. Maybe it's possible to attach the wires better to those shorter and longer pins but I have to wait till it arrives.

Removing both epoxy blobs should also be effective.<br />You'll still get a nicer (and reuseable) result if you can find a desoldering iron or heat gun or possibly even a blowtorch.<br /><br />Here's some reference material:<br /><a href="http://www.instructables.com/id/desoldering-components-with-rubbing-alcohol/?ALLSTEPS" class="postlink">Desoldering using a plate full of rubbing alcohol</a><br /><a href="http://www.uchobby.com/index.php/scrounging/how-to-heat-gun/" class="postlink">Desoldering using a heat gun</a>

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I almost did it with the new slot. Desoldering took 3 hours. I couldn't find my sold absorber. I don't have a heat gun and didn't want to try it the other way at open fire.<br /><br />Almost everything attached, 4 wires missing, it was very stable but the wires are thick and heavy (what has pro and cons) but I didn't know how to stick that to my breadboard. They are also too short. Soldering to aluminium now worked.<br />And the slot construction would make it very difficult to later change the cartridge. So I desoldered again all wires and first have to built a more stable and upright construction.<br /><br />I'm running out of long wires and maybe they shouldn't be much too long or connected multiple times. I will try to measure and bend the wires before soldering now or maybe use again a floppy disk cable.<br /><br />Maybe female jumper wires would fit to the slot pins? But either pins or black tubing might be too thick for the neighboring pins. I also don't want to spend much more money (at least nothing expensive for stuff that might work, then wait and test again and pay again shipping costs).<br /><br />I will try it somehow but it turns out more and more, that I maybe can't manage that. At least not on my own.<br />I also found some mistakes on my breadboard and also in the code.<br /><br />Any more advice?

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I now have attached the slot to a wooden box.<br />Currently I'm building the wiring including one or 2 harness adapters which is a combination of a floppy disk cable and thicker wires to better plug them into the breadboard.<br />I doubt that this will work. The wires in the floppy cable are very thin and break easily. In total 34 long wires are needed and that's quite heavy, difficult to hold and solder. Maybe I would need another construction to lift and hold up the wires.<br /><br />Probably this is my last try.<br /><br />After that I have to search for someone with more skills who is willing to cooperate and where I can send my slot (and carts). I probably would need help writing an emulator later anyway.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Soldering some of the thin floppy wires worked much better than thought and better than on the previous slot as this slot was soldered to the PCB and isn't new. Although it's very fragile and I don't know if I can manage 34 wires. Maybe I need 2 floppy cables for the 4 rows.<br /><br />The wiring construction including harness, thicker long wires and base is heavy and fragile. A floppy cable alone is heavy. Maybe I can't move that construction including the wooden box and have to carry the PC and monitor to where I'm soldering.<br />Another problem is that wire 1 is not near pin 1 on the breadboard but at pin 60. I turned it over and first considered the box upright and bending the wires over. Maybe I better would have started from the breadboard.<br /><br />Maybe I build a 2 story or angled construction from the other side of the breadboard. Can you imagine 34 thicker wires next to each other? 3 or 4 times as wide as the floppy cable. The 60 pins on the breadboard are also aligned in one long row (so one complete board wide). <br /><br />I don't know how thick a pin is and what the distance is. Some pins are also bent and have some solder on it. Maybe the jumper wires fit but don't know if they would keep sticking. The pins could also be too short.<br /><br />In 1 or 2 days I will know if it all works. I hope the code is OK. I don't know if it all would be stable for more days.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I give it up.<br /><br />Look to the photos and you see why.<br /><br />First the thin drilled wires often undrill and the tin hardly sticks. The tension and force of the other wires are too big. One soldered, 2 got loose. Either break off or get in contact with the tin of the neighboring pin or the iron.<br /><br />Then I tried it with a 2nd harness adapter. No big problem soldering the copper wires to the thinner wires due to the different material. And the copper wires also can be soldered much easier to the slot pins.<br />Same problem with the tension forces. I also have problems with the tin temperature (often not fluid enough) and I would need a 3rd hand. No problems soldering the Arduino header pins.<br />The outer rows are quite easy as you can solder them to the side. But not with 4 rows. At some points I have less than 1 mm. I can't solder that with my equipment and skills.<br />I also have too many bridged connections and I doubt that everything is still on the right place. <br />I'm more and more destroying the slot. The 2nd console is also destroyed during desoldering. Soldering onto the PCB was much easier, but I couldn't cut it out as there was a glob chip on the rear side at the same place.<br /><br />I need somebody who can do that for me. Either in my neighborhood or I have to send slot and games. Better than I would ruin my carts.
