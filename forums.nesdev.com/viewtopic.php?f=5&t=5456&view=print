<br />
<br />- A computer isn't a toy; you can install a software for children and they can play with that. There are a couple of products that mimics a toy though; special TVs with a custom case, like Barbie-theme for girls, or the Pooh bear for the boys. They are not toys in this case. Next, Mega Man is a game; you can buy Mega Man action figures - those ones are toys, including plastic vehicles, guns etc..
<br />
<br />- You can think something as a toy. Well, a new cute car, red, sport, looks like "toys for adults". Got it? ^_^;;

<br />6. 	an animal of a breed or variety noted for smallness of size: The winning terrier at the dog show was a toy.
<br />7. 	a close-fitting cap of linen or wool, with flaps coming down to the shoulders, formerly worn by women in Scotland.
<br />8. 	a simple, light piece of music, esp. of 16th or 17th century England, written for the virginal.

<br />
<br />There are many outer types of complex and heavily engineered toys that can be quite createive and artfull, but they are still toys. 
<br />
<br />Whats wrong with it being a toy? Just because a lot of us a grown and still injoy playing them dose not make it a bad thing. personally I am loseing interest in video games but thats not really the point.

If you define "toy" as a physical object, then the computer becomes a "toy" when a video game is in RAM and a "tool" when OpenOffice.org is in RAM. In that case, a video game is "a program that makes a computer into a toy".

<br />|--------------------------------------------|
<br />Second thought
<br />|--------------------------------------------|
<br />I feel a Video Game can bring emotions like no other form of enterntainment can bring. Not even movies, and definitely not a doll or a paddleball.
<br />
<br />Especially now, Video Games may have resembled toys, And I would consider an Atari 2600 a toy, but the modern VGs have multi million dollar budgets, contain multple forms of art (Eg: Visual, music, moion acting, voice acting, <strong>Programming </strong>etc.) and take ages to develop remember tloz:tp)
<br />
<br />If I had a choice I wouldn't even say the g in rpg. If it were up to me I probbably would've called it a Virtual Adventure or something... Not Role Playing game.
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />|--------------------------------------------|
<br />Breakdown &amp; Conclusion
<br />|--------------------------------------------|
<br />
<br />I conclude that Something that Amuse a person( EG: Fiction books, movies, Video Games, Fine Art, etc)are not toys just because they share some similar roles and effects
<br />|--------------------------------------------|
<br />
<br />It is worth mentioning that I would conside 'Ateam' for the Atari 2600 a toy but not 'Grand theft auto iv' for PC/360/ps3.
<br /><span style="font-size: 67%; line-height: normal">(Didn't know where to slip that in. LOL.)</span>
<br />
<br />And this is the end of my report or whatver.
<br />I know, it sucked.

(At least some) <br />They offer an interactive experience like nothing else can.<br /><br />But as tepples said<br /><div class="quotetitle">tepples wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">Video games are computer simulations of toys</div>
<br />
<br />Through my mind, this is true if it is a VG of a toy or an arcade game.
<br />And I've always felt uneasy that VG's are sold in toy stores.
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />//I dunno, I've been devoted to VG's my whole life,  I've also had a deep hate for toys too. maybe I just don't want to admit that I'm going to college and getting a degree related to "toys". (Damn, I hate that word!)
<br />
<br />Some of my favorite toys that I had when I was growing up was a cap from a tube of toothpaste and cardboard boxes. I didn't really like these highly corperated toys that lacked imagineation to use them. But I did have plenty.

<br />I believe this is a good time to say how ridiculous I think this is. A sport is something you do, not something you watch. A few guys are paid huge cash to play a game while a bunch of people that get absolutely nothing out of the victory of either team keep running this billionaire industry. There are even people killing each other because of teams.
<br />
<br />Here in Brazil it's some kind of crime to not root for any soccer team. People look at me like I'm an alien when I say I don't have a team. Everyone really goes "what's your team?", like not having one isn't even an option, I find it retarded. But it's true, 99% of the population roots for a team, including 90-year-old ladies.
<br />
<br />I guess people just like to watch other people doing things instead of doing them themselves for some reason. Stupid reality shows like Big Brother are big hits, and there's nothing really interesting going on, it's just a bunch of people doing regular things. Sex is another thing that's much more fun to do than watch, yet porn is... well, everyone knows how popular porn is.
<br />
<br />I don't mean to offend anyone here who does like (watching) sports, it's just that I don't get it. All I think this really does is create a world where a guy is paid millions to kick a ball around.
