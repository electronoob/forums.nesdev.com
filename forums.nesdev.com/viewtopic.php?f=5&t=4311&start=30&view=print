<br />
<br />i have no idsa what the deal is considering i never but used nesdev bbs irregularly in the first place.

<br />only real issue i see is that you aren't getting NES code or help that much from me.

I don't urinate on those I consider inferior, simply because they're inferior, but I certainly consider some individuals inferior enough to not care about.<br /><br />Inferior intellectual and willing to learn is a newbie. Play nice.<br />Inferior unintellectual and unwilling to learn is a moron who I don't care about.<br />Inferior and uncommited to the mind is just someone ignorant. Poor them.<br /><br />I take the stance that if I can do something or understand something, then that should be a sign that virtually anyone should be able to concieve of it. I'm not so good that everyone else is less. I'm just enough to wonder how the hell people can be so stupid as to be too incapacitated to out-think me if the problem and solution is explained to them. Why do you need to try and pull a fast one on me, when there's either a better solution, or not a better solution. I don't have to like being outdone, but I'd at least like them to best me without changing the subject to how much I know, and killing the argument that way.<br /><br />As for labeling...um...yeah. I do that. It helps a lot. Intelligence can't be labeled easily, because of it's diversity. People who know some things somehow tend to learn more than those who resolutely stand by their infallibility. Ignorance is a lot easier to pin down, because it's either incidental and reversible, or a core belief. Which one I find determines if I think the person is wasting oxygen too close to me.</div>
<br />
<br />I had no motives behind what typed its simply the truth. I have already explained where I stand on the subject in my second to last post in this thread. And your post is an example of what I was talking about  Don't assume to know what people are thinking

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I don't usually assume I know what people are thinking, but have you ever expected to get an honest, well-reasoned answer out of some stranger you were debating when you asked them "What are your thoughts on this issue"?
<br />
<br />I see signs of people not thinking, and I'll usually choose either to get away from them, or challenge the notion they've given me by trying to see what they have in mind. It sometimes happens that I find them to be a poor communicator. This usually leads to me leaving them alone. Other times, I find them to be using something other than sound thinking to come to their conclusions.
<br />
<br />I won't ignore the hints that people leave that tell how they've come to a conclusion, because I've tried it, and that leaves those giving detailed explainations about the sun, and those giving detailed explainations about the monkeys living on the sun even footing from the start. It also leaves those telling you what to do for your own good and those telling you what to do for their own narcissistic 'perfect' view of the world on even footing.
<br />
<br />It's not always obvious if someone is giving you information or a belief, or how they came to their conclusion. Some complexity is inherent to complex topics, and some is misdirection. Trying to come to the conclusion of which is which is sometimes impossible because it's a case of someone repeating what they heard. Then it becomes a case of how well the person can filter out ideas that make no sense, or a matter of not believing a thing they say.
<br />
<br />I don't feel the need to think in a politically correct sense. If I've found a use for labeling, and testing those labels shows them to be subjectively accurate to an acceptable degree, then I'll use labeling as a guide to what qualities in a person I should test first. If you're going to get information from someone, it's important to know how much to trust that information, or how to concieve of it from their viewpoint. (This is like 'profiling' at an airport. Even if it's illegal, if some guy acts nervous, and resembles how a hijacker is believed to look like, then there's a decent chance that person will be checked a bit more thoroughly than someone who doesn't display such signs)
<br />
<br />I'd cite an example of how experience and understanding shape how people use language, vocal or bodily, but I don't think that's neccesary in present company.
<br />
<br />In the case of Jargon, I threw him something to chew on, and I'd have to say he choked or puked in response. Admittedly, it's not everyone's interest to talk about the issues I threw around, but simple sheer randomness prevailed(as in, redirecting the conversation, only randomly)
<br />
<br />In your case(peppers), you believe I shouldn't label people(because I can't know what they think), where-as I believe I'm doing little harm in pre-judging people to the degree of what I test in them to get insight. If someone wants to think I'm wrong, that's fine. If you want to convince me I'm wrong, that's fine. If you want to say I'm wrong, see the previous sentence, because in some way you're suggesting that someone should stop my belief.

<br />ugetab's lengthy post in summary has made me draw the conclusion that indeed jargon is getting what he wants:  Attention.  Also, turmoil and chaos.

Don't make useless clutter. If you disagree with the clutter, stop the people who make the most trash posts.
<br />
<br />At some point, free speech becomes harassment. You can't read a thread you want, and also give someone full rights to continually misdirect the topic. Conversations just don't evolve in that type of environment. If we'll split off a divergent conversation into 2 decent topics, why won't we split off a garbage topic, and then get rid of it?

<br />
<br />If you want to post ban questionnaires, maybe you should instead ask an admin to create intervention threads, not create ban polls yourself.
<br />
<br />This thread is pretty much mostly nonconstructive criticism.

<br />Not once have I seen a single constructive suggestion about how I could operate the board any differently, other than <strong>tepples</strong> suggesting that I don't curse so much.
