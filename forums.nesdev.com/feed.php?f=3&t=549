Nintendulator is really great for accuracy and has the log feature, but it screen render is really bad for my viewpoint. FCEU is nearly as accurate than Nintendulator, and has the debugger, and very nice rendered graphics, and is pretty slow, but nintenulator is even much more slower.<br />Virtua NES render also very good graphics, but has some problem while toggling $2006 midframe (not always emulated correctly) and while toggling $2001 midscanline, and emulates PAL very badly. It is not very accurate, but enough for most licenced NTSC games. I has a lot of other function, such as Name Table viewer (that Nintendulator also has, but it slows the thing down a lot). And VirtuaNES is pretty fast, and cause no problem running evin on my old slow PC, while Nintendulator runs even too slow on my new fast PC.<br />I think the XBost is one of the worst gaming machines out there, and should not be used at all, even to use it to play old games.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=38">Bregalad</a> — Mon Sep 19, 2005 10:32 am</p><hr />

Nintendulator is all about low-level CPU, PPU, and APU accuracy.  It could be, hands down, the end all be all of NES emulators if more work was done on usability improvements and polish for the end-gamer... that and ports to other platforms.  Its slowness is becoming a thing of the past, with the progression of computer hardware.  My point is that I wish more emulator authors started basing their emulators ontop of Nintendulator.<br /><br />However, currently, my most used NES emulator is FCEUltra on the Xbox.  I wish more emulators were ported to the Xbox... or at least a more recent port of FCEUltra <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />  Because of the hardware acceleration, you can tweak FCEUltra/Xbox to get the overscan perfect.  I did the side-by-side comparison with a real NES on a real TV.  FCEUltra/Xbox's output was blurrier than the real NES, but otherwise was fairly close to the real thing.  Of course, peripherial comparison was wildly different.  NES games are meant to be played with a real D-pad, not the crap pawned off on people these days.  Hell, even Nintendo has botched up their D-pad on the Gamecube, GBASP, and NDS.  Oh well.<br /><br />Anyway, for my FCEUltra/Xbox gets more gameplay-time because of the usability stuff that goes ontop of a solid emulator core.  IMO, there is nothing stopping Nintendulator from having this, assuming somebody wanted to spend the time.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=94">Jagasian</a> — Mon Sep 19, 2005 9:08 am</p><hr />

The goal of the author for his emulator is whatever his goal is (the emulator itself has no goal, being non-sentient). Some write theirs in different languages, or try to implement unique features, or just enjoy the process itself.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=17">blargg</a> — Mon Sep 19, 2005 3:06 am</p><hr />

Even if we emulate an NES whose PPU generates component signals instead of emulating down to the level of NTSC composite or S-video signals, a lot of commercial and homebrew games such as <em>Super C</em> take advantage of the fact that the top and bottom are cut off so that they can hide the garbage when an attribute block is split across the top and bottom of the screen.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=9">tepples</a> — Sun Sep 18, 2005 1:40 pm</p><hr />

Never mind, I fixed it. Okay, I was wondering something. What if you want things in your NMI to happen, but you want some things in your routine to happen at different times? Like, I want to increment vbl_count constantly, but I don't always want my sprite sitting there on the screen. How could I avoid this?

Oh, man.. Something happened to my controls, and it's really bad. Well first of all, yes, my sprite does show up in Nintendulator, but when you press right, the sprite goes left really fast, when you press left, the sprite goes southwest really slow, when you press up, it goes up really fast, and when you press down, you go down a little slower, but not much. Oh, and if you press up twice, then press left, and it just goes left really slow. But if you press down twice, it goes southwest again. What happened?
