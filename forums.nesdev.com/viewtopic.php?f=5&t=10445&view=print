Intel's GMA is integrated into some models of CPUs as I'm sure you know, so the issue may be related to GPU drivers.  Gigabyte Technical Support should be able to help you with this.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />The memory is stolen from main RAM so it really does not matter if you have 32MB or 32GB. <br />Win7 probably allows dynamic allocation of it from the driver which is for the better, tying up a big chunk of your RAM for something that does not really give anything is not very useful. Tons of VRAM does not give any significant extra peformance, having a better GPU does, especially if its integrated video that steals its memory from main RAM.<br />GPUs all can stream data from main RAM since AGP times, and when main RAM is your VRAM there is no point in keeping that VRAM big.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I think the point of having separate VRAM in the first place is to keep the CPU from having to wait for the GPU or vice versa. Compare the Commodore 64, whose VIC accesses RAM while the CPU's Ï†2 is low and occasionally has to pull RDY low for a burst of transfer during &quot;bad lines&quot;, to the NES or any other Coleco-derivative architecture, whose PPU has full access to VRAM outside of vertical or forced blanking. Perhaps it's not so important on modern PCs because they have fat caches to get at least some work done while the equivalent of RDY is low.
