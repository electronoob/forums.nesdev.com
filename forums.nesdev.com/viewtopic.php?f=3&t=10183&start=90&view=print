		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />&gt; Done<br /><br />I was referring to 1.0 limitations, as I presumed all of these issues have been solved in 2.0. Is that not the case?<br /><br />&gt; MAME license it's plain BSD license + non-commercial clause, nothing particularly odd.<br /><br />Despite MAME being free software and open source, you have people who will claim that it is not Free Software nor Open Source. You can tell by the capitalization that you're dealing with an ideology rather than pragmatism. I've found as much success arguing with these types as religious fundamentalists.<br /><br />&gt; also, you might want to notice that MAME/MESS transparently handle having zip content uncompressed in a folder since 1999<br /><br />Interesting, I never even knew it could do that. I require a DLL (included with my emulator) to decompress archives to a folder first, so that my core can use native filesystem APIs on each file, and can write to the folder if need be (flash ROM, SRAM, etc.) Definitely causes more drama, but it seems by making it transparent that nobody even realizes it exists :/<br /><br />&gt; just two small remarks: separate PRG/CHR is the most natural approach when you come from arcade emulation (chips are separate, not glued together, and their content is often mapped to different CPUs so that it does not make any sense to put pieces together). you might like or dislike it, but it is not strange at all.<br /><br />This is just another matter where people are passionate about keeping things the same. Let's be honest, regardless of which side you are on, it's really not a big deal whether you load one file or two, and whether you skip 16 bytes at the top of a file or not.<br /><br />That said, I completely agree. It's just too bad MAME and I still have one key disagreeance.<br /><br />I prefer to split files based on their actual mappings and usage in practice. The same exact game could have two 16mbit ROM chips on the first printing, and one 32mbit ROM chip on the second printing. It's an interesting note in a database somewhere, but it's useless information to an emulator, unless you want to simulate the 74LS switch that selects each chip, which nobody ever does.<br /><br />MAME tends to prefer grouping files by ICs, even when this is contradictory to how the data is used by CPUs. Case in point being the SNES DSPs. They have both program and data ROMs inside of them, yet they exist on separate buses inside of the CPU (strict Harvard architecture.)<br /><br />I know MAME supports alternate loading methods and that's great. It's just a shame we can't agree on how to split files. This is going to be instant anti-splitting fodder. It's part of the reason I came up with that SNES ROM + DSP ROM merged file format. Which is in itself truly ironic: all of the traditionally pro-merged file people (iNES and SNES copier header folks) absolutely abhor it and want the DSP firmware in separate files. Like I said, it's all about keeping things the same to them. There's no logic or consistency, nor agreeance with how things were done in the first place, it's strictly a matter of backward-compatibility.<br /><br />&gt; also, I'm not going to download the full FitzRoy's set just to check this, but do you have the correct manifests for the Nantettatte! Baseball add-on carts (which work more or less like the Sufami Turbo)?<br /><br />My NES emulation is primitive and doesn't support wild stuff like that yet.<br /><br />But for Sufami Turbo, I support that fully. Both the base Sufami Turbo cart, and each slotted sub-cart, get their own folders (or archives) that contain the split files and manifests describing the boards. If you load the Sufami Turbo SFC cart, it asks you to load zero to two ST carts. For BS, the manifests describe writability, size, flash type, etc. For ST, the manifests describe ROM, RAM and linking capabilities (it won't ask you to load a second cart if the first isn't linkable anyway.)<br /><br />&gt; The part that I cannot use parts of the programs in real FOSS programs<br /><br />The problem is the GPL, which restricts you from using non-commercial code with it. That's not MAME's fault. BSD is a real FOSS license, and there's no problem with mixing BSD and MAME code. Copyright and copyleft are two sides of the same coin, it's just a matter of who the restrictions are being placed on: the developers or the users.<br /><br />Regardless, it's <em>much</em> too late for MAME/MESS or Snes9X to ever allow commercial use. Too many long-gone developers have contributed code to it.

It would require extra decoding logic, but if a game is written to use NROM-368 then you don't have to use all of it and you can use $4800-$FFFF and avoid the extra decoding logic, but if someone wants to use more than that they can add the extra decoding logic onto their cartridge.

Imagine if I tried to claim that any license which required reproducing the license in binary form (second of the two-clause BSD license) was not Good Software. &quot;Sorry tepples, your application isn't Good Software.&quot; It'd be annoying, wouldn't it? A casual person doesn't care about what some loaded capitalized term means. That is the very definition of ideology. They filter out the capital letters entirely, and read it as &quot;your application isn't good software&quot;, aka &quot;your application is bad.&quot;

So I suppose it is possible both sides are correct but meaning different things.

However, see above about multiple meanings of words. I say MAME is not free software and it is not open source, which is also correct (sometimes the terms are capitalized to attempt to make it clear that one meaning is meant and not the other one, but not always).

Yes there are different reference dates used due to precession (for this example, I am using tropical zodiac, which means the reference date is equal to the date for which you are giving the positions, and the ayanamsha (the Sanskrit word for the amount of precession) is always zero). The term &quot;Cancer&quot; here refers to the astrological sign, not the constellation; and an astrological sign is simply 30 degrees of the ecliptic (Cancer is the fourth sign so its range is 90 to 120 degrees). This is the same &quot;Cancer&quot; as is in the &quot;Tropic of Cancer&quot; on the world map. However, it is also correct that the Sun is in Gemini, but that is if by &quot;Gemini&quot; you mean the constellation and not the astrological sign. There are 88 constellations in total. The article you linked to is making the same mistake; they claim astrologers don't get the position of the Sun correct, but actually they do, they are just using terminology that isn't familiar to most astronomers. Of course this doesn't mean astrology works (I don't believe in astrology either); it only means that the terminology is different. (And note that the two tropics on the world map correspond to astrological signs, not to constellations. A lot of people make these mistakes, and needs to learn that the words can have different meaning in different contexts.)<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">I think it is actually the grammar of English language that pronouns such as &quot;He&quot; are capitalized if it refers to God</div>Not all religious groups consistently use &quot;He&quot; for God.

I don't find it sensible to use &quot;he&quot; for God with my own religious points of view. I believe in a non-personal God, although I am also panentheist and ignostic, and believe in some of the concepts of deism.<br /><br />Of course all of this is getting pretty much off topic.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />The English syntax that is appropriate is the capitalization of proper nouns. If you are referring to a god named &quot;God&quot; by name, you would capitalize that name. Capitalizing pronouns like &quot;he&quot; and &quot;his&quot; is not normally correct English syntax, though perhaps &quot;He&quot; is simply another name for your god, in which case it may also be a proper noun? If you don't want to stretch that far, maybe just consider it an improper syntax, but one that religious texts may find useful as a form of highlight or disambiguation. (I.e. a specialized syntax for a specialist field.)

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Apart from mentioning the existence of evil deity in the TV series <em>The Powerpuff Girls</em> who goes by the proper name Him (rhymes with Kim or Tim), I'm done with the offtopic discussion. So let me try to rerail the discussion by summarizing what we know so far.<br /><br />The core problem:<br /><ul><li>A game contains a circuit board, ICs, and ROMs. </li><li>The behavior of a board and ICs can be described in plain English, but the behavior of ROMs pretty much depends on their data. </li><li>The behavior of a board can change if different ICs are on it (e.g. normal vs. crazy UNROM), and an IC can produce different behaviors in different boards (e.g. MMC3 on TLSROM vs. TLROM). </li><li>The law has greatly different treatment of board and IC descriptions vs. ROM data. </li><li>There are several different containers for ROM data. These include iNES, PNG-style chunks, Tar, Zip, 7-Zip, and a folder. </li><li>There are several different ways to express a &quot;manifest&quot;, or description of the board's behavior: iNES, NES 2.0 (an extension to iNES), XML/JSON/INI/YAML/BML with a schema to be determined, or any of several formats included in a database distributed with an emulator. </li><li>Occasionally a game is made of two cartridges that work together. </li></ul><br />This leads to several approaches:<br /><ul><li>iNES uses the iNES container with an iNES manifest in the header. </li><li>NES 2.0 uses the iNES container with extended ROM sizes, with an NES 2.0 manifest. </li><li>Occasionally, iNES containers of multiple region versions, revisions, and hacks of a single game are nested in a 7-Zip container to take advantage of 7-Zip's solid compression. </li><li>UNIF used PNG-style chunks with a manifest spread across multiple chunks. </li><li>Pasofami uses a folder with a proprietary manifest. </li><li>A lot of emulators include a database to correct wrong or ambiguous iNES manifests. </li><li>The original ZapFC proposal, intended only for pre-1997 games, used Zip with such a database. </li><li>The revised ZapFC proposal includes a manifest, as does the MESS format and byuu's proposal. </li><li>Super NES and Game Boy games include an internal manifest at a particular address in ROM, in the actual cartridge. </li><li>This appended chunk proposal uses the iNES container with a manifest wrapped in a sync-size-checksum chunk structure similar to PNG and UNIF. It has been suggested that NES emulators also recognize such a manifest in an otherwise unused part of PRG ROM or CHR ROM so that even dumps from a cartridge will include the correct manifest. </li></ul><br />Each approach has some limitations:<br /><ul><li>Some manifest formats, such as iNES and UNIF, ended up leaving a lot of things ambiguous. </li><li>Some manifest formats are poorly documented. </li><li>Compressed containers work well on emulators and post-GBA handhelds but are prohibitive to parse on flash equipment for the NES. </li><li>The same is true of the more human-readable manifest formats. </li><li>Parsing some manifest formats, such as iNES, requires bit manipulations of roughly the same complexity as the $2005-&gt;t logic. </li><li>Some collections of ROM images are distributed with incorrect manifests. </li><li>Separately distributed manifests are inconvenient for people who release new homebrew programs, new Chinese dumps, or ROM hacks. </li><li>Getting people to adopt a new container or manifest for existing collections of ROM dumps is difficult. </li><li>The same is true of emulator developers. </li><li>Developers of new commercial NES games trying to sabotage emulation could include an intentionally misleading internal manifest in the ROM data on a cartridge. </li><li>Users don't want to have to resolve conflicting manifests (internal vs. inner container vs. outer container vs. database) when loading a game. </li><li>Emulator user interfaces occasionally need to consider nested containers with multiple games. </li><li>No container to date includes the ROM of sample playback chips on certain Jaleco games. </li></ul>

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />&gt; Super NES and Game Boy games include an internal manifest at a particular address in ROM.<br /><br />Yes, but we have ambiguities here as well. Just not nearly as bad as NES.<br /><br />For SNES, there are RAM mapping problems with Ys 3 vs Fire Emblem: Thracia 776; ST010 and ST011 use the same special chip ID, etc.<br /><br />For GB, there's the MMM01 mapper. The most common merged ROM ordering puts the MMM01 boot ROM at the bottom, which means the correct mapper ID is in a different location.<br /><br />GBA and NDS lack save RAM method (SRAM, EEPROM, Flash) and vendor IDs (that change protocols for Flash.)<br /><br />Mega Drive lacks SVP, lock-on, EEPROM, and bootleg markup.<br /><br />Master System doesn't specify mappers.<br /><br />The pattern is that nearly all systems have either no information, or incomplete information, embedded inside the games themselves. The dream goal would be to have a consistent way, across all platforms, to describe the boards. This will of course never happen, but it'd sure be nice.<br /><br />&gt; No container to date includes the ROM of sample playback chips on certain Jaleco games. <br /><br />I have some precedent for that, in that the MSU1 chip accepts a list of PCM recordings.<br /><br />Has anyone managed to decap and dump those sample ROMs yet?

It's just too bad MAME and I still have one key disagreeance.<br /><br />I prefer to split files based on their actual mappings and usage in practice. The same exact game could have two 16mbit ROM chips on the first printing, and one 32mbit ROM chip on the second printing. It's an interesting note in a database somewhere, but it's useless information to an emulator, unless you want to simulate the 74LS switch that selects each chip, which nobody ever does.<br /><br />MAME tends to prefer grouping files by ICs, even when this is contradictory to how the data is used by CPUs. Case in point being the SNES DSPs. They have both program and data ROMs inside of them, yet they exist on separate buses inside of the CPU (strict Harvard architecture.)</div><br /><br />Incase you were unaware, the reason this is done is because MAME also serves to help preserve actual arcade boards. So if you have a bad ROM chip, you can get the data from the MAME rom set and repair your board. It's not *just* about emulating the games.
