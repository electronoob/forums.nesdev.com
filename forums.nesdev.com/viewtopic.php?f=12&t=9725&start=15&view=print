So basically, distributing free homebrews will make emulator usage less likely to be a &quot;piracy&quot; act, right ? This would go well along my thoughts.<br /><br />And yes, back then I over-reacted to what sivak did. It is not as bad as I painted it back then, as I wasn't even aware as how greedy the repro makers are now, which is much worse. Also it's more the way he did it than what he did that annoyed me : It was REALLY like : Hey guys wanna play my game ? You want it, you want it ? WELL YOU'LL HAVE TO PAY ME FOR IT HAHA. AND REAL EXPENSIVE.<br /><br />I am not against someone selling homebrew carts, but then they should not expect anyone to help them for free.

Would you not expect to help me for free just because I wrote the menu system for the (long-delayed) cartridge for the 2011 NESdev competition? And Sivak did distribute the first mission of BK1 gratis.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />This is a complex subject, because people learn things for free on the internet all the time, and it's not uncommon for them to use that knowledge to make money. For example, if someone learns about HTML and CSS for free are they not allowed to make web pages for money?<br /><br />The problem with NES homebrews is a bit different, because developers try to sell games to <strong>the very people that gave them the knowledge</strong> they needed to make said games. IMO, getting advice from other programmers is just a little part of what makes a game. After gathering the necessary knowledge, the programmer still has a long way until the game is finished, and the small number of completed games is the proof that this isn't an easy task, so I believe they deserve some sort of compensation if they desire it. Nothing wrong with that.<br /><br />However, I feel that everyone should give something back. When you release a game for free, you are helping to make the scene more interesting. If you release it with source code, you're providing study material. Everything that causes the scene to grow and release even more games is good for us. If you don't want to release your games for free because that would hurt your profits, you should do something else to help. If a person shows up here only to ask for help and later to promote the finished product you have to pay for, IMO that's a fail.

If you think about it, he has to create something *worth* paying for to make any money. I don't think just technical information can alone be applied to make a game worth paying for. Battle Kid did result in renewed interest with the NES and the idea of new games being released. That part was certainly good.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />The idea of being upset because sivak learned things on the internet and then made profits is pretty crazy IMO.  All of his original works/hack were free.  He has demos for free.  And it was probably the motivation of the success (money included) of the first battlekid that motivated him and the other people he worked with to make BK2.<br /><br />I'm pretty sure most of the people lending help on this forum are doing it because we enjoy spending copious amounts of time talking about something we're passionate about.  The forum is more of entertainment than sharing knowledge expecting to somehow being compensated for it.  If you feel violated because someone used the knowledge you willingly shared to make a profit, then perhaps you should stick to a private notepad vice an internet forum...<br /><br />As for giving back to the community I think the creation of a sequel BK2 is awesome enough.  I don't know to what extent everyone helped sivak here.  But for me, when he posted questions about how to solve his hardware problems I was excited to chime in with the idea I may have possibly helped him in some small way.  To think that he somehow owes us is just asinine...   Yeah, let's poop on one of the few people in the community that finished quality homebrews.  Because he's making money from a HUGE amount of his own hard work, creativity, and personal motivation, with a dash of knowledge we willingly shared/made public.  That'll surely promote the community and motivate people to create quality stuff.  If it makes you feel any better I'd think it's a pretty safe bet that his equivalent 'wage' from the earnings is below minimum wage...

If charging money gets in the way of contributing back, then like you say, that doesn't fit in with a community like this. At this point, even a game whose developer makes no further posts once it's released is still contributing back in many ways. Primarily, they're showing what's possible, which might raise the bar in many people's minds and cause them to strive to do a lot more. Their game gives lots of good insights into how they designed it and what one might do to make a successful game in this day and age. Personally I'm thrilled that the Battle Kid games have been such a hit and shown that homebrew games can really be in the same league as games back in the day.<br /><br />But hey, I love the free market and the value it creates for everyone through entirely voluntary trades that leave both parties off better than before.

I'd guess under 1000 units sold.<br />The only issues I have with Battle Kid are the plagiarized music from RushJet1, and the lack of purchasable ROM image.  Besides those issues, it's a seriously awesome and uber-challenging series of games, and I'm cursing my ass off every second of the way, and enjoying it.  I'm guessing no ROM file to prevent savestates.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />The price is not outrageous for Battle Kid.  The manual, cartridge, chips, board and distribution do cost something, especially in a low print run.  Sivak's time and opportunity cost must be considered.  I would suggest that of the $30 asking price, he may make $20 in profit per copy sold.  Say 1,000 copies are sold, he may make $20,000.00 for the game.  Consider how many hours he, one man, put into programming it, designing the graphics, composing the sound, debugging and playtesting it, he probably spent 1,000 hours.  $20/hour is not a bad wage, but its not like he was trying to get rich of the retro-community.

Carts aren't free. Even assuming bunnyboy worked totally for free, and Sivak made 100% of what was left after buying parts and printing manuals I don't think it'd be $20 per. Bunnyboy might buy in enough volume to to get his costs down really low, but even then he spends time putting it together.<br /><br />Doing carts shows you do it for the love, because selling a rom would be easier, the price could be cheaper, you'd reach for people, and you'd probably make more.
