<br />A lot of games don't work at all and the ones who works has graphic gliches. In the best case, there is a lot of puncts on the background that aren't supposed to be here, the same goes for sprites. Looks like pattern table reading shucks. This is not a cartidge problem scince it happens to all my games and it's not a cable or adaptater problem scince I use the same cable/adaptater for my SNES and it works fine.
<br />What sould I do ?

<br />Buy a can of de-ox spray and shoot the edge of the black connector both top and bottom sides (where the cart goes in).
<br />
<br />I've cleaned connectors that were totally corroded, nothing else could clean them (tried most all other solvents).
<br />Beware, laquer thinner will melt the plastic.
<br />
<br />De-Ox is excellent for making old NESs work perfectly.

<br />
<br />NES might be the only one with non-vital signals, the CHR bus.  Non-vital as in the game won't crash instantly from reading a single bit wrongly.
<br />
<br />I've seen it happen on my toploader before also, if the game didn't make good contact, soon the tiles would slowly turn to garbage.  But I very rarely have any bad contacts on the PRG bus.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Yeah, I use a frontloader and I think european toploaders don't exist at all.
<br />The glitches are effectively non-vital, but I've heard that Super Mario's title screen data were stored in Chr, and it's effectively very glitchy. Also, Tiny Toons adventure II's title screen is terrible, there is just random letters everywhere on the screen. Does somone know if it reads the ChrRom to draw the title screen like Super Mario Bross. ?
<br />I'll try to open my nes and de-oxide it so. Actually, I just bought the Tiny Toon Adv. both I and II cards I've said above and they was terribly full of dust and oxided. Stupidly, I inserted them in my NES, then saw they weren't working, so I oppened them to clead the box and de-oxided the connectors. Now, they works just as other games, looks like this endomaged my NES's female connector. Damn it. Why does some people not store they NES cartidges correctly, but let them lying on the ground ?

<br />How would you go about cleaning the frontloading NES without having to take it apart, and without using the cleaner (because I don't have it)?
<br />
<br />I put water on the edge of a tetris cart, and stuck that in and out a few times, and let it dry with a hairdryer. (probably really stupid, but it worked. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /> )

<br />
<br />Better use distilled water when you do that.  Tap water in some areas will leave lots of calcium after it dries.

Normally, connectors shall be dryed after usage (in order to remove all the non-desired stuff on the connectors), but here it was impossible. So there is still lots of point on my screen and I begin to be tired of it... grr... stupid connectors.
<br />Drag : Are you sure it worked ? If so you're so lucky, I think this would damage the connectors rather than cleaning them.

I've found that taking the carts apart, and bearing down on edge connector with some force using a cotton cloth with De-Ox will bring your carts back to life, they work as new.
<br />
<br />Here's a guide to the 72-pin connector I'm talking about,
<br />
<br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.jandar.net/nes72pin/">http://www.jandar.net/nes72pin/</a><!-- m -->
<br />
<br />If this is corroded, the only way to fix it, is to either replace it, or use De-Ox. Water or alcohal won't cut it.

<br />Yeah, that's exactly what I did for the Tiny Toons Adv cards I just bought, they were incredibly dirty, and now after that they're just fine (I also cleaned the plastic box with water).
<br />Thanks for the link, I'll now be able to take this connector apart and clean it correctly. I hope this'll work.
