I can't name any of the top off my head, but IIRC TCRF should have a few of them (I think one of them had pieces of the game source code). I guess some old tools tried to be clever with optimizations by not clearing unused memory, or only writing disk sectors partially.

Well apparently some developers also used the 620mb disk to act as a server for their source code or something like that, because there's an almost complete copy of the original <a href="https://github.com/cynthia/art_of_fighting_neogeo_mvs" class="postlink">SNK Neo-Geo source code for Art of Fighting stuffed inside the PCE port's retail CDs</a>.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I'm also trying to think why this junk gets into rom images.<br /><br />Perhaps the tool that ultimately creates the rom image declares one large chunk of RAM, but never bothers to zero or $FF it.<br />The system RAM on the host computer of course contains data from other programs that were loaded into its RAM previously.<br />The tool creating the rom image goes from bank to bank, and just stops copying early if the source data for that bank does not completely fill it.<br />Ending earlier at the bank of course leaves the previous data there.<br /><br />When done, the entire chunk of RAM is copied to the rom image file, that is later sent to the EPROM writer or onto a floppy disk.<br /><br />Otherwise I can't fathom that one would copy raw sectors from a storage disk-- it seems like more effort to read raw sectors than read and write from the filestream.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I definitely remember writing programs in C, compiled with Borland Turbo C++ v3.0, running in x86 real mode under DOS, and allocating memory using malloc (which makes no guarantees about the contents of the memory when allocated, unlike calloc) and finding random crap in the allocated memory blocks.<br /><br />To me, it feels like a safe assumption that this is the entire cause.

Then I opened my hex editor and had a good laugh. Wow, it's real.<br /><br />I wonder if, for similar reasons to those stated above, this could be an artifact of the dumping process (random chunks of the dumper's harddrive sectors or RAM contents). Who knows what silly copying techniques people used when they first dumped this probably 20 years ago?<br /><br />Well, I'm not gonna be the one to go to Ebay and play repro-roulette at $100 a cart to get a verified dump. I did ping @JayObernolte on Twitter trying to get some info.

And copied it in entirety onto the original ROM.<br /><br />There's no reason to believe it won't play correctly.
