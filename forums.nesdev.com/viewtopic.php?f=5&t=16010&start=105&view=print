CRTs are all that complexity, plus needing leaded glass (which is simply unlawful in the EU) and toxic chemicals (the phosphors) and the complexity of building a functional aperture grille.<br /><br />Building a mechanically scanned laser raster display will be cheaper.

EXAMPLE: The EU RoHS Directive exempts lead in cathode ray tubes &#40;CRTs&#41;. If a particular CRT television contains lead in the glass of the CRT above the 0.1% maximum concentration value &#40;MCV&#41; for lead, and if the lead in the CRT glass is the only substance that exceeds the MCV, both the EU and California would allow the sale of that television.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />RoHS compliance or not, maybe a new CRT is impractical given its special parts. <br /><br />I think these general criteria would make sense, for starters:<br />-Be able to build from off the shelf components to a high degree. <br />-Everything outside the PSU box should be operable at non-fatal voltage levels<br />-May be offered as a final product, DIY kit, bare PCB + BOM. One hobbyist may commision another who's more confident with a soldering iron to populate a board and/or assemble the whole thing.<br /><br />So the challenge then becomes coming up with a non-crt screen that:<br />-renders correctly as far as the eyeball is concerned<br />-without delays or interleaves<br />-will work with a light gun<br /><br />Then, perhaps:<br />-More or less modular approach:<br />--External PSU<br />--External sound<br />--You pick which &quot;shield&quot;/&quot;hat&quot; suits your need the best for a reciever/decoder; and perhaps a sound module or remote control reciever if you want that. Third parties may offer their own designs or you can stripboard one yourself. <br /><br />Pins may be an initial extra hardware cost, but you gain the freedom of adding in whatever you want and may omit the rest. RF, composite, scart...

Plus you can just make it HDMI in the first place.  The question is to either use HDMI timing and convert it to composite/component, or vice versa.

They'll upconvert (and deinterlace, even if it's supposed to be 240p) but the image quality is terrible, and more importantly the lag is really really bad.<br /><br />Last Christmas holiday, I played a game of Mario Golf with my brother, my sister, and my brother's wife.  I was the only one who picked a non-straight shooter (Mario, because he has one of the longest drives).  This screwed me when my mom decided to take a nap in the next room and we had to move upstairs and plug the N64 into an HDTV.  I couldn't hit the fairway to save my life; the timing was off by at least a tenth of the swing bar.  My brother ended up beating me with Plum.<br /><br />If we'd been playing Duck Hunt we'd have had to quit.

I've made simple programs that detects hardware, displays text and played around with the PSG sound channels though.<br /><br />Lots of homebrew are made using HuC (CC65 still isn't up for it), but Chris Covell started making a great <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hp6UaGcPXbY" class="postlink">beginner guide</a> for people that wanna start out with PC Engine assembly.

From my understanding, CRTs have had digital TVs beat for the longest time in that they can display both pure black and pure white next to each other, but now that OLED is a thing, digital TVs can do the same.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I'm slowly working on something along the lines of an universal CRT driver board, to get most out of existing tubes and allow them to be used with moden inputs etc.... All the larger screens have decent enough dot pitch to show 1280x960 with not a whole lot of loss, and you can feed them higher resolutions and it would still look usable, free subpixel scaling helps a bit lol. I'm still learning about the power supply side of things and I have not yet tested how far can non monitor deflection coils be pushed, but the rest is mostly figured out and will need prototype to be actually built. I will not be making any futher fuzz about it until there's actually something working going on.<br />...But my motivations will run really low once OLED stuff is affordable (and there isn't any retarded image processing things going on with their inputs but hopes are low on that regard though). One can only hope a monitor doesn't have any unnecessary things in it though, but for now, monitors cost even more than the TVs do... In theory it would be possible to scan an OLED panel like a CRT, getting light gun/pen compatibility and whatnot, but that requires the electronics in the panel to allow updating individual pixels rather than entire rows or columns, i.e passive matrix style rather than active matrix similar to how plasma screens work (which are now no longer manufactured).<br />Another future project is pretty much an universal digital panel driver, to fix up the image processing aspect, but it won't happen anytime soon either lol.
