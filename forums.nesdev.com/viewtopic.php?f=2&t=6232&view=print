<br />Is GPL the best model in this case? Is there some other licence I should look at that is a better fit? In essence;
<br />
<br />a) do what you like with it as long as you don't try to commercially distribute it (unless I give you permission)
<br />b) don't modify it unless you clearly state that it's been modified
<br />c) make sure I'm credited if you plan to redistribute/modify it

This means that if others can commercially exploit NTRQ in a given product, you get to commercially exploit their version of the product under the same terms. For example, if Sivak's next game (let's call it BK2) uses a GPL music engine, then Sivak has to provide source code for BK2, and you can lawfully make and sell a total conversion mod of BK2 as long as you distribute source code. See also <a href="http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/selling.html" class="postlink">FSF's view on commercial exploitation</a>.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">a) do what you like with it as long as you don't try to commercially distribute it (unless I give you permission)<br />b) don't modify it unless you clearly state that it's been modified<br />c) make sure I'm credited if you plan to redistribute/modify it<br />d) don't misrepresent it as your own work<br />d) no warranty</div>
<br />b) c), d), and d) are pretty much the same as the zlib license. If you want a license like that of zlib, but you want to limit distribution of copies for a fee, consider the license of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PhyreEngine" class="postlink">PhyreEngine</a>.
<br />
<br />@thefox: The last time I used Creative Commons license chooser, it asked if the work was a computer program, in which case it would usually recommend one of the GNU licenses.

<br />Out of interest I had a look a the Creative Commons link and it came up with this;
<br />
<br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/2.0/uk/">http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/2.0/uk/</a><!-- m -->
<br />
<br />which is not far off but it doesn't clearly make a distinction between using NTRQ player and music data in your commercial product and actually selling on NTRQ as a commercial product itself.
<br />
<br />Maybe I need two licences? One for the editor and one for the player code?

<br />Hmmmm...
<br />
<br />I need some opinions then. Personally I don't wish to make any money from the project (hence setting up a charity donations link on the website). I don't  care and would actively encourage people to modify the code as long as it's not misrepresented. What I can't square in my head is that someone could sell for profit what I spent 6 months creating when I'm giving it away for free. Of course, a bit of text in a text file is not going to stop anyone but I'd least like to be able to distribute it with a clear message of what I, as the author of the work, deem allowable.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />So, with the GPL, if the cost of distribution is negligible (i.e. the internet), then people can't really profit off the distribution and "getting it legitimately for free" is better than paying money for it.
<br />
<br />Counterargument 1: what happened with the hackmii installer. So they put a giant boilerplate on start that said "if you paid money for this demand it back"
<br />
<br />Counterargument 2: Intrinsically, putting a rom into a cart will cost money, which makes the distribution have an intrinsic cost. Are you ok with people selling carts at cost? Does "at cost" include payment for their time? How much are they allowed to charge per hour? and so on.
<br />
<br />In your situation I'd either use CC-NC-BY (despite what CC says) or the GPL (and maybe preempt the cart argument by finding someone to distribute the software in cart form)

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />i've actually been meaning to ask you about this, Neil. it's beyond generous of you to make NTRQ available for free (well, hopefully for a donation to a great cause). however, there's certainly a lot of guys/gals out there in the chiptune scene that are going to want to have it on a cartridge to use with their NES in both live and studio situations. right now their only option for this is to buy a PowerPak (which i'd surely suggest) or to have one of the repro sites or someone make a custom cart for it. unfortunately, the sceners tend to be cheapskates (not all of course, but a fair number of them) and will opt for the less costly route almost every time. i think this is where you may run into trouble with people producing and selling carts without your permission, and most likely without paying for it (the software) in any way. to be fair though, the scene has been very protective of Johan Kotlinkski (LSDJ) and Oliver Wittchow (Nanoloop), so we can only hope they'd do the same for you by making sure that a buyer had donated to the cause before getting a cartridge.
<br />
<br />i'm wondering though if it's possible to set something up with RetroZone to have some nice high quality carts produced and sold to those that would want them? seems they're not very into the ROM being released for free if they're trying to sell carts, but some people are going to want a cart version either way so it only makes sense to have it available for them. i don't think the free ROM would be much of a deterrent in a case like this. it's easy to get the LSDJ ROM (free or legit), but everyone still wants it in cart form. i think that if NTRQ were available on a cart for $30-40 you'd be able to sell a ton of them and put your profits right into the charity. this would also save people the trouble of going through another party to have their carts made, and i think they would be very grateful for it.
<br />
<br />any thoughts on this idea?
<br />

<br />
<br />You know, I had an hour long car journey earlier and being stuck in "rush hour" traffic gave me time to contemplate. By strange coincidence I'd come to the same conclusion - it doesn't matter what text I include with the ROM, somebody, somewhere is going to do something nefarious and it's not worth losing sleep over. It's not even like I can "enforce" any type of licence anyway, apart from pointing a finger, shaking a fist, calling someone names on an internet forum.
<br />
<br />C'est la vie.
<br />
<br />Thanks for chipping in and helping clarify my thoughts.

<br />There's a guy who goes by the name of Mute City who says he's willing to produce carts of NTRQ and also someone over on chipmusic.org (who's name escapes me right now).
<br />
<br />However, I'm still to be convinced this could be a workable solution.
<br />
<br />Someone else suggested getting in contact with bunnyboy about the possibility of a simplified PowerPak (single mapper support for example) but I've not had the time to get around to it. If anyone knows him and wants to rattle his cage it would be interesting to see what he has to say on the subject.
<br />
<br />At the very least I should be getting a couple of points on every new PowerPak that's sold (joking!) <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />

It's pretty straight-forward; Wikipedia goes over the "extra" details.
<br />
<br />I don't mind my code being used in commercial or proprietary stuff, nor do I demand reimbursement in such cases.  I consider the BSD license pretty fair/realistic, that's why I use it.  Otherwise, WTFPL is what I'd go with.

<br />Because <a href="http://google-opensource.blogspot.com/2008/05/standing-against-license-proliferation.html" class="postlink">it complicates matters when a non-lawyer wants to combine two works</a>, one of which uses this original license. Thus, you should use a well-known license if you want to minimize problems of this sort.
<br />
<br />As for the GPL allowing commercial sales, given that all the source material must be available along with the product being sold, it will have to be pretty good to persuade people to pay for it even though they can get the source material for free. By prohibiting this sort of thing, you (neilbaldwin) might eliminate opportunities for making it more widely available and valuable to people. A person selling something based on it is investing his own capital and time into the project, and not taking from you in any way, so I'm puzzled by the desire to limit such things. If you allow them, you free yourself from having to do them yourself. If I could write some code and have someone else do the work of putting it into a hardware product so that more people could benefit, I'd love it. But I'm not claiming you should think like me, just trying to illuminate the reasons I feel this way.
