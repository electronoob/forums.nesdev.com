<br />
<br />What are the mapper numbers that don't have anything assigned to them?

<br />What's mapper 84, and why does the Kevtendo mapper status page mark it as a "poison mapper"?
<br />
<br /><span style="font-size: 75%; line-height: normal">[Reality check]<br />*running out of steam, will think of more questions later*<br />Sorry to bore you with all these questions which I might be able to answer by looking at the iNES website. I'm not developing an emulator; I'm just curious. I *know* that the Kevtendo mapper status page isn't fully updated, so I shouldn't be picking on it too much. Oh well. Now for the really important question:<br />[/Reality check]</span>
<br />
<br />The <a href="http://nesdev.com/bbs/viewtopic.php?t=1538" class="postlink">PC10 version of Mike Tyson's Punch-Out!!</a> seems to use a MMC2 variant that has battery-backed WRAM. Since regular MMC2 doesn't have that, perhaps it is necessary to assign a new mapper number or UNIF board to this game? (Nestopia runs the existing "Mike Tyson's Punch-Out!! (PC10)" dump just fine, but it ignores the battery RAM that is specified in the iNES header.)

<br />UNIF: Yes.
<br />iNES: Probably not, given the overloading philosophy of the overall file format. Mapper 9 + no battery = PNROM, while mapper 9 + battery = the PC10 version's board.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Now that the discussion about FFE has been split, I would like to add one more issue: I would like someone to investigate what <a href="http://www.romhacking.net/trans/764/" class="postlink">this translation's</a> documentation says about mapper 78.
<br />
<br />Specifically, the documentation says this (emphasis mine):<div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">...Because all this compression was already in place, there was nothing left<br />for me to compress.  I had to expand the ROM with a mapper chip to fit in the<br />English text.  But, I only needed a really basic chip that simply doubles the<br />lower bank of program ROM as this is where all the 496 blocks of text are<br />stored.  I would simply swap it based on which of the pieces of text need to<br />be displayed at any moment.<br /><br />It turned out that Mapper 78, the Irem 74HC161/32 chip was perfect.  With it<br />you could have any number of program banks replace the first program bank, but<br />not change the second program bank--exactly what I needed.  You can switch<br />character banks with it too, but I didn't need that.  Supposedly, "several<br />Japanese Irem titles use this mapper", but I could only find two.<br /><br />* Uchuusen - Cosmo Carrier  by Jaleco<br />* Holy Diver                by irem<br /><br />And <strong><em>they switch banks quite differently, so in reality they are actually two<br />completely different mapper chips.  Holy Diver's mapper needed a special 256<br />byte table to work... yuck, I didn't have that kind of room to waste.  But<br />Uchuusen's mapper, you simply load the bank number you want into register A<br />and then perform this 4 byte piece of code.</em></strong>  Easy and efficient.<br /><br />tay            ;A8<br />sta $d548,y    ;99 48 D5</div>Should mapper 78 be split? Or do the two games mentioned really use the same bankswitching method and different data patterns to handle bus conflicts (Holy Diver a table of all possible byte values, and Uchuusen - Cosmo Carrier something a little more clever)?
