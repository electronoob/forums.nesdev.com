Maybe what we have now is better, who knows ? However, once a game is developped, it is much easier to developp other from your routines you already made, I presume (this never happened to me yet).<br />I think all developpers has different style of engines, so all did have different routines they made themselves. The common devkit should so be pretty small.<br />The only way to know is get one from Intelligent System, but I think even if you have money I don't know if they still have all the material for NES.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=38">Bregalad</a> — Sun Mar 12, 2006 11:41 am</p><hr />

sure, a official nes devkit would be cool.. but I'm actually wondering how fancy it is. I mean the only thing I can come up with on how it would look is the nesdev manual, a assembler, maybe some sample code, some pcb's without any roms installed and possible a eprom programmer and some eproms. I mean the devkit thing coulnd't have been so big back then that they had speciall machines for development, could it?

Yeah, for rarity purpose, a sealed old game sure is rare.<br />I perfectly understand (and I am even victim) of the pleasure to have a very rare game copy. And I feel good playing a game on the real hardware with a licenced cartridge that 99% of people just plays under emulation.<br />However, while it sure is rare, have a game sealed you can just have the pleasure to own it, but not to play it. And who could say the game inside work, without unsealing it ??<br /><br />Also, collecting 120 years old wine is as much, if not much more crazy.

The more obscure and hard to find an item is, the more valuable it becomes.  In the case of a sealed game pak, shrink-wrap and all, you have to consider that they haven't mass-produced those things in years, and probably never will again.  Its value has nothing to do with its usefulness as a game, although it would be worthless if the game inside doesn't work.<br /><br />Kind of like wine collectors - recently a 120+year old bottle of wine sold for $100,000.  How do you know it's not vinegar in there?  Odds are, the collector will never know as to check would produce an insanely expensive antique bottle and some possibly spoiled wine.<br /><br />Now from the standpoint that you wanted to play Fire Emblem, and don't have a copy, its value is strictly in the "does it work" category.  The fact that its still in its box would have a nostagic value, or maybe a "never been used" kind of value to it, but that's all.  The real deal is: can I play that game I've wanted to check out since I read about it in 1994?<br /><br />This is like the guys who own Model-T cars and still drive them around town.  Original parts only add to the utility and authenticity of their hobby - so things are value-less if they can't be used. <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=273">pragma</a> — Fri Mar 10, 2006 12:56 pm</p><hr />

That'd be like, you can't use paypal to pay for that because it's so expensive! No, I'm just exaggerating. It would be REALLY pricy though. I just want the cartridge so I can play the game. What do I have that's rare.... Haha... Golf... Final Fantasy 3j... Final Fantasy 2j.... Cosmic Epsilon! That game is the shi-ite! I own Dragon Quest 3 and 4 as well.

I'm pretty sure it's not a 4004 or 4040.  IIRC, the datasheet had a pic of the die and it looked nothing like the CIC die.  Though I suppose it could've been a work-alike too (I doubt it).<br /><br />The only promising lead I could find was in some old patents by Sharp for some 4-bit microcontrollers, had the instruction set right there in the patent doc.  But my hand disassembly (of how I assumed the bits would've been aranged) came out looking like garbage.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=10">Memblers</a> — Wed Jan 11, 2006 7:58 pm</p><hr />
