I'm sitting here with a gutted/disassembled NES ready for a Hi-Def kit to be put in, and I was thinking about the palette file switching this kit is capable of. Would it be possible to assign a color other than black for the colors that are on the far right of the palette? I'm referring to palettes $0D, $1D, $0E, $1E, $2E, $3E, $0F, $1F, $2F, and $3F. I want to expand the NES palette and would love some extra colors to work with. I've supplied emulators with custom palette files before and hacked ROMs to address those palettes and they worked fine. I'm hoping I would be able to do the same thing here. Thoughts?<br /><br />Edit: From the wiki:<br /><img src="https://wiki.nesdev.com/w/images/5/59/Savtool-swatches.png" alt="Image" /><br />I'm referring to the black ones to the right. I realize many games use $0F for black, so I'll keep it that way. I'll probably hijack $0D instead. My question is now, though, how is the data packaged in the .nes update ROM? How do I go about finding the palettes in the package, and is it safe to edit them?<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=8737">KP9000</a> — Mon Sep 25, 2017 9:28 pm</p><hr />

<em>Some of this is a simplification, intended for someone who's not quite an advanced NES programmer.</em><br /><br />&quot;Zero overscan&quot; meaning you can push the top or bottom border out by 1 pixel and see the whiteness? If so, your NES and PowerPak are OK, but you're seeing an artifact of the NES's video memory limit.<br /><br />The NES PPU's background map is 2 screens wide by 2 screens high. But there's only enough video memory in the Control Deck to configure it as 1 screen wide by 2 screens high (&quot;vertical arrangement&quot;) or 2 screens wide by 1 screen high (&quot;horizontal arrangement&quot;). The map is <a href="https://wiki.nesdev.com/w/index.php/Mirroring#Nametable_Mirroring" class="postlink">mirrored</a>, or duplicated, into the missing space: a vertical arrangement (1x2) is mirrored horizontally, and a horizontal arrangement (2x1) is mirrored vertically. The cartridge chooses which of these two applies. On a simpler cartridge, a blob of solder on the H or V pad chooses horizontal or vertical arrangement. More sophisticated cartridges can rearrange the map at runtime; this is why <em>Metroid</em> scrolls in four directions without any visible problems.<br /><br />You may be familiar with the discolored tiles at the right side of <em>Super Mario Bros. 3</em>. This is because the game scrolls horizontally on a cartridge configured for vertical arrangement. (It does this because the game also scrolls vertically and diagonally.) Likewise, if you try to scroll vertically on a cartridge configured for horizontal arrangement, a line of text or graphics will be momentarily split between the top and bottom of the screen. Most NTSC TVs have at least 8 pixels of overscan on top and bottom, which largely hides this artifact. But yours has none, causing the artifact to be visible. In <em>Concentration Room</em> and <em>Haunted: Halloween '85</em>, I tried to accommodate zero-overscan displays by blanking the line that would be split. This is important for the PAL NES, which has 1 line of overscan at the top and none at the bottom.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=9">tepples</a> — Thu Aug 31, 2017 3:51 am</p><hr />

Dude, PLEASE bring back Interpolation. I cannot get this looking right, without it. <br />If your original version didn't have it, I would never have bought the NES-HDMI.<br />If you need space, take out some of those god awful HQ scalers. <br /><br />The new palettes are very good though.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=8685">evil_ash_xero</a> — Mon Aug 28, 2017 11:04 am</p><hr />

Yeah, on top of payment processing difficulties, pre-orders can potentially be stressful for everyone and the supplier in particular, especially if a part shortage, manufacturing mishap, or any kind of unexpected issue comes up.  If 99% of the buyers are completely chill about it, the remaining 1% would more than make up for it.  Probably would be cool if there was some kind of queue people could get in, but even then you'd have to deal with people reserving a spot and then not being ready to pay when the time comes (then there's work involved with managing such a queue as well).<br /><br />It's an amazing product though, well worth the wait. <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=10">Memblers</a> — Sun Aug 27, 2017 2:43 am</p><hr />
