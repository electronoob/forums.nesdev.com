Of course, the problem with drawing with roughly screen-sized chunks, such as your 256x256, is that it makes the maps more repetitive. In fact, some sections in 1-1 of Super Mario Land for Game Boy were so repetitive that the first time I played, I thought I was in a looping level similar to 4-4 and 7-4 of the original Super Mario Bros. I think that's why Sonic 2 for Genesis used chunks no larger than 128x128.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=9">tepples</a> — Fri Feb 12, 2010 8:49 am</p><hr />

I usually say that it's impossible to make a generic enough level editor, as each game has very specific needs. Even though level maps can be divided in two main groups, grid-based and object-based, every game has different requirements.<br /><br />Technically you could use a generic editor to place the blocks in a grid and make level maps, that will later be converted to the specific game formats, but what about games with level formats such as the one used in MD/GEN Sonic games, where intermediary blocks are used (the metatiles are used to build larger blocks which are the ones used to build the map)? If you draw freely using only metatiles, without considering the intermediary blocks, the data converter will generate an insane number of intermediary blocks, killing the whole purpose of the compression scheme.<br /><br />This is why I decided to use GIMP to edit my maps, I can set the grid to the size of any of the blocks (16x16, 32x32, 64x64, 128x128, 256x256) so that I can draw each area with the precision I need. If I need to make a very specific ramp, I'll use the 16x16 blocks, but when I need long flat grass sections I can probably copy a whole 256x256 chunk.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=95">tokumaru</a> — Fri Feb 12, 2010 8:44 am</p><hr />

The level editor always deals with 2x2 tiles as the "smallest" metatile, since this so naturally fits in with 2 bits of an attribute entry. Beyond that, a specific game plugin is entirely responsible for reading a large 2D array of meta tiles and converting it to its own compression format. I suppose one could come up with some generic way of multiply nesting meta-meta tiles as far as the user pleases (I think Banshaku was working on an idea like this for his editor), but sometimes people use totally different approaches like RLE (or a combination). So I mean maybe NESICIDE could give the user a few "basic" things that would work out of the box, but allow them to write their own plugins to perform customized map compression.<br /><br />*edit* it seems like even a plugin system based on 2x2 meta tiles may not be sufficient in all cases, what about games that have variable height and slopes and so forth? It seems like it would be quite a challenge to create a flexible map building system into an IDE. I guess one could still use 2x2 meta tiles but embed the height information within them. Perhaps the plugins could expose customized properties and data for height or other attributes..etc.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3735">GradualGames</a> — Fri Feb 12, 2010 7:27 am</p><hr />

About this project: I can't seem to download anything from these GIT servers via TortiseHG. So is it closed until release, or do I have to sign up for server access?<br /><br />EDIT: I used the wrong type of GIT for windows, so I read and will use MSYSGIT.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=287">Hamtaro126</a> — Fri Dec 25, 2009 2:27 pm</p><hr />

Although we wont have time to put in any graphics designers before the xmas eve cutoff, we will be able to handle graphics. I have already added support for importing binary files, and am currently working on the CHR-ROM bank designer. Basically under the Project/Graphics/ section of the project browser, there will be a folder called "Banks", which you can add banks. You then double-click said bank to open up the bank designer. In this designer, you will be able to import binary data files. In the future you will also be able to add items from the graphics designers (and yes, these designers will have convenience functionality to automatically add a bank and/or add itself to a bank if the user wants it to).<br /><br />CHR-ROM banks cannot be declared in the source code because the graphics banks must be already completely assembled to allow preprocessor directives that can get the bank number, as well as offsets into said banks for named resources.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=4132">essial</a> — Wed Dec 23, 2009 9:49 pm</p><hr />
