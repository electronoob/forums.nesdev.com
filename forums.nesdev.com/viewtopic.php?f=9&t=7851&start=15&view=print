<br />
<br />On the NES, they use one section of the 74HCU04 to invert A13, so it's truly /A13.  Also, on the famicom, make sure they are not just using a resistor network somewhere for the pullup.  It most likely DOES have a pullup somewhere, or else it will not work properly.  It might be indicated somewhere else, like with other signals to a resistor network instead of by the transistor.
<br />
<br />btw we call such a thing an "open collector inverter".  The nearest analog would be a 7406.

There is no proper schematic really.<br /><br />CHR A13 should be the Chip Enable for the CHR-ROM because it is low while the PPU is accessing the pattern tables. FARID's schematic is correct in this regard. That's what I was talking about in the other post: CHR A13 is the Active-Low Chip Enable for the CHR-ROM.</div>
<br />
<br />So I'm getting a little confused but...  I think I figured out what at least I was confused about.
<br />
<br />If you look here:  <a href="http://bootgod.dyndns.org:7777/image.php?ImageID=4343" class="postlink">http://bootgod.dyndns.org:7777/image.php?ImageID=4343</a>
<br />
<br />pins 48 and 49 are shorted together.
<br />
<br />I was basing my knowledge of the FC pinout based on the 60 to 72 pin converter:  <a href="http://www.nesdev.com/NES_ADAPTER.txt" class="postlink">http://www.nesdev.com/NES_ADAPTER.txt</a>
<br />
<br />In the converter doc it labels pin 49 as CHR A13, but in the wiki like Farid linked to pin 49 is CHR /A13.  And my schematic from the kazzo matches the wiki: <img src="http://www.infiniteneslives.com/img/images/kazzo_schematics.png" alt="Image" />
<br />
<br />So pins 48 and 49 are connected like I said but I had the pinout wrong and Farid was right CHR /A13 is shorted to VRAM/CS (CIRAM/CE) 
<br />
<br />Good news is I think this solves my CHR/A13 bug with the kazzo, I'll test it out and post there.
<br />
<br />But I'm still a little confused because I've made the 60 to 72 pin converter according to the .txt instructions above.  I think qbradq hit it though, the FC CHR A13 must be active low, it doesn't make sense why CHR A13 is active low but labeled as an active high signal.  It should be CHR /A13 if it were active low, the ROM has /CE not CE.  The NES (or atleast the labeling) isn't backwards like this CHR A13 is active high and CHR /A13 is active low.  But really it's all just a matter of labeling, and different places label it differently and that's why we're (atleast I was) confused.

<br />
<br />
<br />Yeah I was thinking about this after my post.  The label should really be based off what the actual harware and software addresses it as.
<br />
<br />So here's my logic: CHR A13: the MSB of the CHR (PPU) address is low (zero) when addressing CHR ROM.  This means the "true" CHR A13 is low when the CHR ROM should be enabled.  So really it's not a matter of active high or active low like I was saying earlier.  It makes no sense to think in terms of A13 being active high/low it's all a matter of reference point.  And by that logic CHR A13 goes to the ROM's /CE. 
<br />
<br />Now this disagrees with the one thing I didn't think to question and that was my knowledge of the commonly accepted 72 pinout which is on the wiki and Kevin's "NES cart types" doc.  I've taken this as gospel up until now and that's why I've been confused.  When everyone was trying to correct me, I thought they were pointing out something else.
<br />
<br />It would seem it's the common labeling of the NES pinout that's all wrong.  If I'm AFU somehow I'd like to know, I find it strange that this hasn't been recognized yet.  I don't think I have the knowledge to say Kevin is wrong here.

It describes using 4-screen mode correctly though.  Another error in that doc was with the EXP connector, pin 4 is supposedly /NMI rather than PRG R/W.  I'll check this on an NES mainboard tomorrow (already have them sitting out since I desoldered some PPUs for decapping), and update the doc.

<br />
<br />Aah it's very possible I was wrong, hehe.  I wrote that document back in 1996/1997 (at least that part of it).  15 years ago I wasn't as well versed on NES as I am now.  Sorry about any confusion it caused.

<br />
<br />do you mean a footnote in the wiki about the errors in the docs?
<br />
<br />That wouldn't have helped me, as I didn't reference the wiki.  The docs just seemed to be easier for me to follow and print out.  Really for me I've been referencing printouts of those docs and if they still have errors they'll be confusing to someone regardless.  But perhaps I'm just strange in the fact I found the docs easier to deal with and rarely use the wiki.
<br />
<br />Although footnotes or somewhere for us  to keep track of it if we can't make the change is better than nothing I guess.
