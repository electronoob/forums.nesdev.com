<br />Strange, I tried Dragon Quest 1 and Door Door (japan version and then run on fnes NTSC version) and they work well here. What is your problem?

<br />I think Door Door just doesn't play music without Frame IRQ.  I don't know offhand of any crashes for that game.
<br />
<br />I only mentioned those games because they are the only games I'm familiar with that use APU Frame IRQ.

<br />I was only joking :)
<br />You never know. FCEUX comes from FCEU, which comes from Bero's FCE, which was what I described previously. But for every FCE, there are 100+ LochNES'es.
<br />
<br />I personally find it amazing how many people attempt NES emulators. There's millions of hardware edge cases, hundreds of custom mapper hardware, dozens of controllers, custom sound packs for some games, years and years of work in a scene that is 95% dominated by Nestopia already, which has every feature under the sun. And yet every time I visit here there's a new project starting out.
<br />
<br />That someone can walk in knowing their project is 99% doomed to obscurity is really awe inspiring. It really shows you're doing it for the experience and not for the fame, which I really respect.
<br />
<br />I certainly wish your project the best, and hope you'll come up with some really novel, never-before-seen feature or twist to stand out from the crowd :D

<br />Exactly. People make them because it's enjoyable, and a way to hone skills. I don't think many would even want their emulator to be popular, given the burdens of having to respond to lots of users and problems.

<br />Unless you're trying to make the first emulator for a platform that can't run standard C++, such as SWF (ActionScript bytecode languages only), Java SE applets (JVM languages only), Java ME MIDlets (JVM languages only), Silverlight (CLR languages only), or XNA (CLR languages only).

<br />
<br />Like <a href="http://www.gitorious.org/nesicide/nesicide-emulator-lib" class="postlink">this</a>?
<br />
<br />Not GDB-style hooks yet but...damn good idea.  =]  There's plenty of hooks there that could be turned into said GDB-style hooks!
<br />
<br />edit: Fixed borked link due to Gitorious repository movement.

Seems I have really misread you, sorry.<br /><br />I'm a bit that way myself, but it's more to do with what I view as stagnation, not as much that I want to be #1. If I were in the NES scene, it would be the iNES format that would be driving me insane right now, and I would want Nestopia to take charge toward eliminating it.<br /><br />In a way, I would not want to be on top because I feel the top player(s) have an obligation to help advance the scene as a whole. Sadly, none of the top players in any scene really seems to agree with me there.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">Zepper wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">What really matters is cooperation here.</div>
<br />
<br />Precisely! This is what I find most valuable. When someone comes into the scene and actively tries to improve things by doing their own research and then sharing their findings with everyone. That is the true spirit of emulation.
<br />
<br />I think this is what ultimately bothers me about there being so many emulators. So many people show up, want all kinds of attention and help, make a tiny bit of progress in basically implementing our existing findings, and then they get bored and abandon everything.
<br />
<br />That, to me, is a colossal waste of everyone's time and energy.
<br />
<br />But just because someone only has "mapper 0" emulated doesn't mean they can't make the next big hardware quirk breakthrough.

<br />I started to implement emulation of APU, is still at an early stage (no sound yet) but at least Dragon Quest 1 (and Dragon Quest 2 i hope, but i can't try it now)  no more freeze after a battle. Links updated (v0.7).
