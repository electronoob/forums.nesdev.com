<br />Large Japanese companies <em>never</em> say bad things about their development &amp; business partners, so even if they had had disagreements, you would never have heard about it.

<br />
<br />I was there in the engineers meeting room back in 1983 in Japan when this happened.  Boy those were some great times, and some really amazing nigiri.  Everyone was in agreement, everyone had the same vision.  There were never any disagreements, as such would violate true bushido code.  I spent the rest of the evening with my fellow enjo kousai and the following morning the NES was born.  This also gave me the opportunity to teach everyone at Ricoh how to say "pants" correctly.
<br />
<br />This story is absolutely true.  I was there.  tepples was also there, but I'm not allowed to talk about that.

<br />I seem to remember reading a web page about a method of teaching proper English pronunciation to Japanese speakers by subtracting the final vowel from a katakana transliteration: ドグ - ウ = dog (DOGU - U = dog). I've also discovered that "ea" in five-vowel systems like those of Spanish, Italian, and Japanese is a decent approximation of the "short A" vowel in "pan". Combining these:
<br />
<br />ペアンツ - ウ = pants (PEANTSU - U = pants)

<br /><em>"Really, all I remember about the Famicom is handling complaints!"</em> - Hiroshi IMANISHI
<br />
<br />I could have a field day with this quote, and it's not even out of context.
<br />
<br />Also, I hope I'm not the only one who reads aforementioned article and keys in on the word "license".  You'll know when you get there.  Folks should ask themselves just how much has changed in 25 years when it comes to "how it all works" (business, technical, etc.).  Same shit, different decade.
