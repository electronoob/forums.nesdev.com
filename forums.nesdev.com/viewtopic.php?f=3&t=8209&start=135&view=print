		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />As I have been heavily working on "lo-fi'ing" graphics in the last months, I want to share some results with you (as it was nesdev which has inspired me a lot).
<br />First some informations about my current algorithm (general):
<br />I'm emulating a TV screen using a virtual composite signal, real demodulation, some glow and a little bit of pixel grid (composite is unbiased). The virtual TV gets rendered at 752x240, "scanlined" to 752x720 and stretched to 960x720.
<br />
<br />How does this fit here? Well, after reading about how the NES generates it's colors I did a quick hack which should resemble the way, the NES works:
<br />- chroma information is a pure square wave (50% duty) which gets phase shifted dependent on which hue is to be produced (period is 12 cycles). Now I generate 13 x 14 boxes of 16x16 pixels each, shifting the hue phase from left to right (last box is zero hue) and increasing the luma from top to bottom. Each pixel is 8 clock cycles.
<br />Dot crawl is also correctly emulated (4 clocks per line). This composite signal is then correctly downsampled and fed into my NTSCTv. The final image gets 2.2 gamma corrected and voila, it works <img src="./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" />
<br />
<br />Two things about NES NTSC:
<br />1. The 'sawtooth' pattern only affects chroma, luma is untouched.
<br />2. The rainbow effect on checkerboard patterns (even without chroma) is an artifact of pixel mixing (a NES pixel is 2.6667 NTSC 'clocks' (4x3.5MHz)) and of course aliasing
<br />
<br />I will have to implement this into an existing NES emu to see how it works in realtime <img src="./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" />
<br />
<br />The images won't have the correct saturation, as I don't adapt to real NES signal levels, but as the TV emu supports brightness, contrast, saturation and color controls this should not be a problem.
<br />
<br />Anyways, here are two images. The first is a 'snapshot' of a crawl phase (a single frame), the second is 'field mixed', i.e. all three crawl phases are mixed into one frame:
<br />
<br /><a href="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/11133993/pal2.png" class="postlink">http://dl.dropbox.com/u/11133993/pal2.png</a>
<br /><a href="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/11133993/pal1.png" class="postlink">http://dl.dropbox.com/u/11133993/pal1.png</a>
<br />
<br />The effect also looks nice as a postprocessing step on RGB NES screenshots, but I will have to get my hands on some 'real' NES screenshots (NES color per pixel) to try it out.
<br />
<br />Edit: The 'snapshot' image shows some heavy dot-crawling and luma-chroma crosstalk because of a heavily opened luma filter. I turned it up for some testings and forgot to reduce it again^^
<br />
<br />Another edit: Here's an image of a 'correct' checkerboard (single frame snapshot):
<br /><a href="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/11133993/checkerboard.png" class="postlink">http://dl.dropbox.com/u/11133993/checkerboard.png</a>
<br />
<br />Edit again: Here are some hacked NES screenshots. The images get converted to native NES colors and then composited. All images are 'field merged'. The colors are created in a very naive way: level/3.f is luma, chroma wave is just -1, 1 ... still looks neat I think.

<br />
<br />Here we go again (another edit):
<br />After checking out how the NES PPU really works I figured out that it doesn't use 3 crawl phases but only 2 (scanline 20), so there's just 0 and 120 degree color carrier shifts. (It still has a 3 line crawl pattern) Knowing this I changed my algorithm to merge just 2 fields and use correct NES colors. Here are two Castlevania shots:
<br />

<br />
<br />I hope this was the last edit (don't want to double post^^).
<br />
<br />And: I'm the new one, greetings from a retro gaming lover <img src="./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" />

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Sorry to bump up this thread, but I have a question about the color palette.
<br />
<br />I'm trying several different formulas, but the color at 120 degrees always comes out as brown instead of red?  When I darken the gamma it comes out red, but it is too dark.  Does NTSC lighten the gamma of the luma but darken the RGB values?
<br />
<br />BTW, I'm using the formula:
<br />
<br />R = Y + amplitude*sin(phase)/.877
<br />B = Y + amplitude*cos(phase)/.492
<br />
<br />
<br />EDIT:  Wait, I figured out why it is comming out brown and not red.  The color I am refering to is $x6 and it is located at 105 degrees, not 120 degrees.  Tepples keeps stating that $x8 is colorburst, but from analysing everybody's palettes, it appears that the colorburst is inbetween $x8 and $x9.

Color $19 is greenish, except when it's next to other pixels that aren't. And it's definitely not precisely, say, <tt style="margin-left: 2px; margin-right: 2px; padding:3px; background-color: #3355aa; color: white;">#287200</tt>.<br /><br />As a result, at least some of the emulation scene has done away with .pal files, because they're horrifically inaccurate.<br /><br />Best practices is to either appropriate parts of blargg's nes-ntsc library, bisqwit's implementation, or implement your own NTSC demodulator.<br /><br />A neat feature you could do with the last is actually replace each color swatch with a gradient of all the resultant colors a given palette entry could end up with.

I would like to use a general purpose palette then if somebody for whatever reason does not like the default palette then they can load their own.
