I know there is much written info out there, but I would love to visually see a step by step video series. Thank you so much.<br /><br /><br />              -Eric

Or just the Nes?<br /><br />Like these guys i can't imagine how a programming on the nes video would be helpful.  The only exception would maybe be a quick video showing how to compile and get the needed programs set up.<br /><br />If you really want a video i would suggest looking at any programming videos, our specifically assembly of any type.  If you know assembly for any CPU you can figure out to program the nes easily with the supporting docs.  Like they are saying, when you have questions of specific instructions and such you want a doc to search and read  NOT a video.<br /><br />Aside from that there is only one way to learn assembly and most programming, actually do it and practice with increasing complexity.<br /><br />Edit:  if you do understand assembly and CPU basics one video that helped me described the 6502 architecture.  In my opinion the key to being good with assembly is fully understanding the hardware/architecture.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Thanks you guys!<br />  I have never programmed anything before. My desire is to eventually make my own NES game. I know its a very tedious and complex process, I just thought that a video for complete beginners with no knowledge of programming would be helpful. I asked Derek, the programmer of Nomolos, what he recommends for beginners. He suggested I read a book by Jeff Duntemann entitled: Assembly Language Step by Step. I ordered the book and it's on it's way. I'm excited about learning more and can't wait until this starts making sense to me. I got a bit discouraged, as I read a portion of the nerdy nights tutorials. I understood the binary and hex stuff, then just started getting confused. I'm hoping, that after I read this book, nerdy nights and other 6502 related tutorials will make more sense. Thanks for your kind replies.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Make sure the book on assembly you got deals with processors like the 6502. If it deals with Intel chips or the Z80, it'll just make it 10x harder than what it is on the NES and it won't help you learn how to do 6502 as well either.<br /><br />My advice? Nerdy Nights on Nintendoage. Google it, you'll find it. Obelisk 6502 (google that to find the site) has a good 6502 reference and instruction overview too. And addressing mode explanations. And everything you'd need help with.

I'm sure most people here find the process of programming for the NES quite fun, otherwise they wouldn't be doing it. Seeing the game finally in action is cool and all, but it takes some time until it happens, so you better enjoy the process as well or you'll just feel frustrated all the time.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">I'm hoping, that after I read this book, nerdy nights and other 6502 related tutorials will make more sense.</div><br />Keep in mind that learning 6502 assembly is just a small part of becoming able to make NES games. 6502 ASM is just the language you use to talk to the system, but in order for it to do anything useful you must also know <strong>what</strong> to tell the system, otherwise the language is useless. You must learn how to use common game programming concepts, so that you are able to construct and give life to a virtual model of the world you are representing.<br /><br />My advice is that you play some games you like, but paying a lot of attention to how every little thing works. Try to break the whole thing down into individual objects (i.e. an enemy is an object, and item is an object, the &quot;camera&quot; that is capturing the action and showing it on your TV is an object) and analyze the rules that each of these objects follow. That's essentially what a game is: a bunch of objects that &quot;live&quot; according to the rules the programmer sets for them. And these are <em>very</em> specific and detailed rules, which is why you have to put so much thought into how each little thing behaves.<br /><br />One thing that often confuses beginners (specially people that have just programmed simple scripts or things without continuous user interaction) is how the interactivity happens, and how the game world still &quot;lives&quot; even if the player isn't doing anything. The answer to that is that the world is updated frame by frame. Every frame, each object gets the chance to compute their next step, based on whatever parameters are relevant. The main character will decide their next move based on what buttons are pressed on the controller, the camera that is following the action will decide in which direction to move based on the position of the main character, and so on. When every object moves a little bit each frame, over the course of several frames you get an animated interactive world.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Strange, I would certainly say that making games is in fact tedious - if we are talking about complete, release quality games. The most of fun is at the start - when you have nothing, but after a relatively short period of time getting something that resembles the end product and gives false sense of an accomplishment ('now when I can walk around and shoot things, I'll finish it in no time!'). If you never finish a project, of course you'll only get fun, but that's actually the reason why projects often get abandoned - the fun ends soon and only lots of tedious works remains. Tons of content like actual levels, actual graphics, sound and music, endless things to fix, add, tweak, bugs to catch, pixels to tweak. It goes on and on, and every time you think that it is finally done, you getting yet another problem.<br /><br />In other words and to keep it short, it is the 80/20 rule in action.

The tedious part is coding AI to enemies, which is the reason I've half-abandoned my current game project, Dragon Skill. I still wish to release it some day of course, but this won't happen without me working on it sadly...

I know each person is different when it comes to learning stuff, some like to read, some prefer to watch videos and some absolutely need a teacher, but when you decide to learn something that is inherently difficult to do, like making games for outdated consoles, you must be enough into it to overcome the fact that the teaching method isn't ideal for you, otherwise you likely won't be able to deal with the other difficulties that will arise along the way.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">Shiru wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">Strange, I would certainly say that making games is in fact tedious - if we are talking about complete, release quality games.</div><br />But then you are usually being paid for the job, and most of the time it's not your ideas and visions you are realizing, but someone else's.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">The most of fun is at the start - when you have nothing, but after a relatively short period of time getting something that resembles the end product and gives false sense of an accomplishment ('now when I can walk around and shoot things, I'll finish it in no time!').</div><br />This is true. Polishing a game and putting all the content is indeed the hardest part of making a game. But it can still be fun...

And since you're one of the few of us that have actually completed quality games, it should mean something. From my time trying to make games I learned one thing: you have to keep the ball rolling. If you take a break from your project, no matter how short, you'll sure lose motivation. When that happens, it's the end.

I'm talking about hobbyists projects. When you being paid for the job, it is quite different story, because it provides strong motivation of different kind - not only the money, but also quite different level of responsibility.<br /><br />Speaking about keeping the ball rolling - well, I guess it is true for many cases. However, I had experience of resuming and finishing (my own) projects that were abandoned for years. It is possible, and I think it is actually a useful experience to try to do it at least once.
