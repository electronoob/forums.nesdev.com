		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Well...after 3 days of playing, 27 coins, 3 endings and a humongous map I drew in MS Paint to show for it, it seems my Lizard adventure has come to a close. I know there might be some secrets I have left to found, but I'd like to hold off until the full release to 100% the game.<br /><br />Ah...and I figured you wouldn't be able to remove some tiles because of engine limitations. Oh well...either way, here are 4 more graphical suggestions in case you ever find yourself hard-pressed for space:<br /><br />1) It seems that you've dedicated an entire 16x16 tile to the seaweed in the underwater area? If you looped the first 8x16 seaweed tile, you could free up a little bit more space for your tileset...And there's also a 16x16 white dot to the left of that? Huh?<br /><br />2) In the void zone, there are 4 tiles dedicated to creating 8x8 blocks and 8px thin platforms. If you wanted to, you could remove these tiles and redesign your maps, replacing the 8x8 blocks with 16x16 ones and the thin platforms with 16px-tall ones. Having thin platforms like these seem reaaally unecessary when the background of the area is already so bleak.<br /><br />3) In addition, there is a 2x8 space to the right of that in the CHR-ROM that doesn't seem to be used at all. Huh?<br /><br />4) <strong>Spoiler alert!</strong> Not really a space-related suggestion, but I was a bit confused when I saw the vulnerable sprite for the cheshire cat boss...I know the cat's head is supposed to be facing up, but the way you drew it makes it look really odd, like the cat's head transformed or something.<br /><br />And with those parting tips, I wish you good luck in finishing your game! Everything in the demo was fantastic, and the entire game had a really great feel to it. Even though I had to retry both bosses at least a dozen times, they never really felt cheap or unfair. The game had an excellent difficulty throughout and you've really found that sweet spot for lengthening the gameplay via death without making it feel padded. In addition, the game just felt fun to play in that weird Fez sorta way. Like, even if I'm not making any progress and I'm going back through areas I've seen a million times, wandering around the game and taking in the scenery is just a joy.<br /><br />But with that being said, the game does have one or two issues. Every time I reached one of the endings, the game would just stop. I would then reset, realize I have the knowledge lizard again and think &quot;Oh no, I've lost all of my progress!&quot; I would then go in the door, touch a save totem and overwrite my password. And it wasn't until many playthroughs later that I realized I could just continue by going left a screen and using the already filled-in password...overall, continuing felt really unintuitive...It might be best to just respawn the character in the password room if they already have a filled-in password.<br /><br />In addition, there's a problem with the randomness-based enemies like the leaping cats or poisonous hermit crabs. Every time I encounter one of those enemies, a lot of my time is wasted just standing there and waiting for them to move. There really needs to be more on those screens to engage the player in the meantime, because <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UC22ZF21Llk" class="postlink">waiting is not fun</a>.<br /><br />And to end on a light-hearted note...SKILLLLLZZZZZZZZZZ! <img src="./images/smilies/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt=":mrgreen:" title="Mr. Green" /><br /><br /><img src="http://fc02.deviantart.net/fs71/f/2014/304/9/e/lizard_skillz_by_dragondeplatino-d84skq2.png" alt="Image" /><br /><br />I can also send you my &quot;completed&quot; map, if you're interested. It might help tell you something is a little too-obscurely hidden to not be found after 3 days of searching.

You could change X to get other rooms (rooms in the demo go from $00 to $9C).<br /><br />Alternatively you can force passwords by holding SELECT + A when you press UP to enter the password door. Here's two that will get you to inaccessible rooms:<br />JLMNN - river test<br />IJINK - disco

The &quot;sometimes Y&quot; is there, but most of the words in that infamous <em>The 7th Guest</em> soup can puzzle (&quot;Shy gypsy, slyly, spryly, tryst by my crypt&quot;) also have S.

Did you choose BNROM because of this distinction, or did you actually need what this board does?  Or do you wish to gut every copy of Deadly Towers so that they could be turned into something better, a contrast from that one Shaq-Fu thing?

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I chose BNROM because:<br /><br />1. I like 32k paging. It makes it very easy to organize the data by having the maximum page size.<br />2. The hardware is incredibly simple, just a single 4-bit latch.<br />3. 256k BNROM is widely supported, including implementations on PowerPak and Everdrive N8.<br /><br />You could more easily put this game on an AxROM board than a BNROM board, since Deadly Towers was only 128k. Someone looking to make a Repro would be better off dismantling a Rare game, probably... but, as I said, the hardware is so simple, this is one of the easiest boards to build from scratch.<br /><br />The main disadvantage is that DPCM sound isn't really feasible (unless you want to duplicate samples in every bank, or not have samples playing when banking). Cross-bank code jumps are a little more complicated than with other mappers, but the banking code only needs to be written once, so I don't consider this a significant issue. Since it's CHR-RAM, you can't do CHR banking animations, but you can do some limited CHR animation through vblank uploads. I don't think any AxROM boards had WRAM, so that might be tricky to add if you need it (I don't).
