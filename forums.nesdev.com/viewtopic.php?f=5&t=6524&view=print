		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Around 10 years ago I had an accidetal debug scrreen pop-up while playing Street Fighter 2 Special Champion Edition on the Genesis.  Looking at the note now, I wrote it down and the screen was called a "010101 EMULATOR."  It had what I now see as register read-outs of some sort.
<br />
<br />Anyway, so what does a bit emulator do in a game?  Why would companies like Capcom apparently employ them in their videogames of that era?

<br />
<br />The 1010 EMULATOR, called "bad A-line instruction" in classic Mac OS, happens when the CPU executes an instruction whose opcode is $A000-$AFFF. Operating systems for computers with 68000 family CPUs, such as classic Mac OS, generally used this as a syscall mechanism. But a statically linked application not running on top of an operating system (such as a Sega game) might implement syscalls as direct subroutine calls and treat these as illegal opcodes.
<br />
<br />The 1111 EMULATOR, called "bad F-line instruction" in classic Mac OS, happens when the CPU executes an instruction whose opcode is $F000-$FFFF. These opcodes were reserved for the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motorola_68881" class="postlink">Motorola 68881 external FPU</a>, which was eventually integrated into the 68040 CPU. If the FPU wasn't present, the CPU would throw an exception that FPU emulator software in the operating system could catch. If no emulator was installed, the operating system would terminate the application. Because classic Mac OS came out before the 68881, it didn't use an FPU emulator; instead, apps used a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_Apple_Numerics_Environment" class="postlink">software floating-point service in the operating system</a>, and FPUs came with INITs (kernel extensions) that patched the floating-point service to use coprocessor calls. A program compiled for 68040, on the other hand, would use the hardware FPU directly and bomb with "bad F-line instruction" if it wasn't available.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />The 6502's BRK instruction is similar to the M68K's A-line and F-line instructions. On encountering a BRK instruction, the NES jumps to the IRQ handler and sets bit 4 on the saved status byte. The saved PC is the address of the BRK instruction + 2, so that the byte after the BRK can be used as a selector, again, similar to how the A-line and F-line instructions have many bits that can be used to select what action to perform.

I was playing Parasol Stars on the Turbografx and somehow 2 player mode was activated, even though only one controller was plugged in (a second player can join in game).  Can't remember if both players were controlled at once.  It was probably a hardware glitch, unless there's an in-game code to activate two players?

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />It'd be sort of like having a NES game where you never use the IRQ, so you put in an IRQ handler that displays a message "Unexpected IRQ", and some bug in the game enables IRQ, perhaps due to executing data as code. Here, they install exception handlers for everything, including A-line and F-line exceptions, and display messages when they are encountered. They might use some A-line traps (as they reduce ROM size), but not all of them, and display that for an unused one. Or you mean why does it get triggered? A bug, most likely involving execution of data, where one of those unused traps is encountered.

<br />Yup. Because triggering that is insanely easy... just roll as you go off screen and keep down pressed, there is nothing more to it. It's a very nasty bug.
