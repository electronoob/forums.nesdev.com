Thanks a lot!  Yeah, I don't plan on bending the pins, seeing as I've messed up EPROMs doing that.  I know it seemed fairly obvious, for some reason I just thought that maybe it was implying that GND was pin 24, I have no idea why.  I guess I was just not reading things properly.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3585">taskforce</a> — Tue Aug 19, 2008 6:41 pm</p><hr />

You need to connect /OE to GND. I don't see why this confuses you. It also depends if you use the cut track method (recommanded) or bend pins (less recommanded).<br />If you cut tracks, just solder pin 24 to GND and pin 2 to any point on the track that was leading to pin 24 before you cut it. If you pend pins, wire pin 2 to hole 24, and the bend pin 24 to GND.<br />GND is acessible on pin 16 but at many other places of the board as well.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=38">Bregalad</a> — Tue Aug 19, 2008 9:55 am</p><hr />

So I've got everything ready to go for my first SNROM cart and I have a little bit of confusion.  I have the original chip pulled from the board, and my new programmed chip with the new game is all ready to go.  However, when looking at the instructions for the cart mod for the EPROM, I had some confusion, hopefully someone can clarify this.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"><br />SNROM (mapper 1):<br />Bend up pins 1, 2, 24, 30 and 31 (or cut tracks 2, 24 and 30)<br />Solder pin 2 to hole 24 (A16)<br />Solder pin 24 to GND (OE)<br />Solder pin 30 to hole 1 (A17)<br /></div><br /><br />So to my understanding, they're telling me to solder pin 2 to hole 24 which would make A16 hole 24 on the NES cart, and then solder pin 24 (which says OE on my pinout for my EPROM) to GND, which on my EPROM is pin 16.  That is where the confusion came.  <br /><br />Am I actually supposed to solder on the EPROM chip itself from pin 24 to pin 16 (which is ground on this chip I'm using)?.  <br /><br />Here is the pinout:<br /><img src="http://www.kosmonaut.ca/D27C010-150V10.jpg" alt="Image" /><br /><br />I think that this would make sense, but if someone could just verify it would be very helpful.  Still just getting the hang of this stuff!<br /><br />Thanks,<br />-B<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3585">taskforce</a> — Tue Aug 19, 2008 8:24 am</p><hr />
