I also would like to make an attempt at this as well, I have read all the posts on this and still feel there is more to it.<br />Can someone that has made this cart several times successfully please give us an exact tutorial on how they did it and with what parts.<br /><br />The more I read on the subject of reproducing these games the more I realise that everyone seems to have thier own ways of doing it. I also see many noobs (myself included) ask the same questions over and over. The answers come flooding in, some more techincal than others resulting in confusing the hell out of most.<br /><br />Your information and patience towards us (noobs) does not go unnoticed, I am very greatfull for everything.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=2415">marvelus10</a> — Sat Feb 24, 2007 3:52 pm</p><hr />

All logic inputs must have a definite value or else whatever they feed might not operate properly (and with CMOS, the entire chip might behave erratically). You might think that if you mirror the data in the ROM, it shouldn't matter what the highest address lines are, but this only applies if they are held at a definite value (high or low).<br /><br />If you are using a larger ROM than necessary, you don't need to mirror data if you tie the unused upper address lines to low (ground, zero). There's nothing magic here; you're just hard-wiring some of the address bits.<br /><br />As for connecting multiple inputs to ground or +5V being a problem, how else would a system function if it couldn't input any combination of high and low values? For TTL logic families, an input draws less power when high, so many designs use inverted logic where high = false and low = true (active low). This is denoted by a bar above the signal name (or sometimes a * or / before the name). CMOS only draws power when a signal changes, so there's not difference power-wise between hard-wiring an input to high or low. Often you don't have a choice anyway, since you need to set an input to a certain value (for example, an unused active-low chip select, i.e. /CS, must be tied low).<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=17">blargg</a> — Thu Apr 27, 2006 10:20 pm</p><hr />

If you ever have a doubt about leaving an input floating, connect it to 0V or +5V. With some logic families, floating inputs will assume one of these two, but with others (like CMOS), they can oscillate depending on the phase of the moon, or even put the chip into a high-current lockup state. Leave inputs floating if you want erratic behavior, otherwise tie them to something known.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=17">blargg</a> — Thu Apr 27, 2006 1:45 pm</p><hr />
