<br />Thank you, loopy!  This is a wonderful development!  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /> 
<br />
<br />I must say, Gradius II is truly an impressive port for the Famicom hardware.  I enjoyed the music and the smooth visuals.  The difficulty is crazy, though, even compared to the intensity I would've expected.  I only passed the first stage.  Truly a hardcore, feature-rich game for the Famicom with a wonderful interpretation of the music.
<br />
<br />Now the main breakthrough we should wait for is MMC5 support.  (...and, of course, VRC7 if possible)  I would like to see the homebrew community become more accustomed to complex mappers that can help to push the capabilities of the system.  Perhaps some of the seasoned coders here will be able to take on grander projects that will make use of more sound channels, more objects on screen, more advanced bank switching, etc.

<br />That wasn't fair, tepples... He might have said that because of the MMC5, which can't increase sprite count but can increase the amount of available tiles for sprites and background, allowing one to draw a larger number of different objects (even if it means using the background).

<br />I think it's like a Catch22 thing where people don't see much point in making an original game using a more advanced mapper because there is no reasonable means to make cartridges and sell them but there is not much reason in making boards for more advanced games when no one is known to be working on and in need of one.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />There appears to be a demand for more powerful mapper designs that will fit in a CPLD. One could start by taking MMC3 and stripping it down, or one could start from the ground up. As I understand it, the "capacity" of a CPLD is measured in macrocells, which roughly correspond to bits of state. NovaYoshi and I were brainstorming one day about ideas for NES mappers that could achieve MMC3-like effects while using MMC1-like macrocell counts, and we came up with this.

Whenever I think of mapper features I'd want, I think of everything I wanted to do at some point but couldn't because of one limitation or another. If we keep aiming only at the old NES games we will never surpass them, and I really believe we can innovate and do more. And more PRG space is not so hard to provide and can make all the difference, IMO.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">I could bump up the mapper to 2048 KiB using four more register bits, two more inputs (D6-D5), and two more outputs (PRG A19-A18).</div><br />I'd really appreciate if you could do this.

It seems that with this mapper I can only pick one to use bankswitching for: the main character or background animations.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">For sprite animations, do what Battletoads does: a big unrolled loop to blast a bunch of bytes at once from a buffer in stack space.</div>
<br />Yeah, my current approach is similar to that. But depending on the amount of background tiles that animate, it would make more sense to update them with the unrolled loop and dedicate the bankswitching to the main character. Hey, at least we have a choice!
<br />
<br />BTW, I don't think using the stack is much of an advantage in this process, as PLA takes the same amount of time an indexed load does, so as long as the data is stored interleaved in the ROM (and properly aligned) you can copy directly from it just as fast, without wasting time using the stack as an intermediary. The only disadvantage is that an indexed load is 3 bytes long, and PLA is just 1, but if you're unrolling code you probably have a lot of space for it (and you can partially unroll it without much performance penalty).
