<br />
<br />San Disk.
<br />
<br />Also I originally drafted a variant of the Social Mutiny Logo when i was in the fifth grade, btw. I used it as the brand logo for my homebrew underground comics i drew and printed on a xerox machine in order to sell for 25cents to 75cents a pop.
<br />
<br />25cents was for coloring and activity books.
<br />50cents was for 12 page comic books.
<br />75cents was for 20 page comic books.
<br />
<br />When Metroid Prime came out I obviously had to redo the logo, note the striking similarity to the Samus 'S'. when you make the bolt and 'm' portions hollow space, and make the outer edge a complete circle minus endpoints of the hollow lightning bolt.
<br />
<br />That was the logo for my original company, Zac Comics Interplanetary, when i was in grade school.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />The bit about online multiplayer NES games sounds like a fun experiment even though I doubt anyone would develop a NES MMO title, I'd love to see one. (Too few people would get the hardware for more than an experiment to take off, methinks).
<br />
<br />If you want to get the NES online I think you'd be going about it the wrong way and this sounds needlessly complex. Were I you I'd design an add-on like the FDS, in the same vein as the Famicom Network System, to interface the NES to an Ethernet network. I'm sure you could manage some text based browsing and playing online text based games like MUDs that way.
<br />
<br />I wouldn't go trying to render web pages on a system with a 1.79 MHz 6502 derivative. Although, if you're not using the sound components of the 2A03 for anything, there is no disadvantage to overclocking the crap out of it except for the potential to occasionally miss an IRQ or two. I've had the 2A03 CPU up to 4.2 MHz before <img src="./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /> That opens the door to a lot of fun weird ideas.
<br />
<br />But yeah, long story short whatever you build will have to be a completely discrete entity with its own RAM, network adapter, storage interface, and hell, maybe its own CPU. It would probably be a little crazy if it had more power under the hood than the NES though!

<br />Well, so far you haven't said any of the right things so you can't blame us for thinking you're full of it and acting childish or you're just trolling.
<br />
<br />I can't blame Kevtris for his decisions as you seem really delusional, especially about your own ability. Just give it up, it's obvious that you don't know what you're talking about, we know better.
<br />
<br />You seem to be planning new illogical features by the minute. When do you explain your intentions they're perplexing and cryptic or just pretty stupid. From all your allusions to 3rd party/homebrew, it sounds as if you wouldn't be doing much anyway except coming up with the silly names for each trivial part.
<br />
<br />And FYI, SanDisk is a brand name, Secure Digital is the name of the interface you keep referring to as "San Disk".

<br />
<br />sorry if i confused "Secure Digital" for "San Disk",
<br />when SD cards first came out San Disk was the primary manufacturer iirc.
<br />
<br />and i have never seen any other product for sale under the manufacturer name San Disk.
<br />
<br />i just made the connection San Disk is an authentic SD card, while others are clones.
<br />
<br />sorry x.x
<br />
<br />btw i plan on gutting a San Disk SD card for making a plug for an SD socket and using that PCB to possibly connect it to my breadboard then connect my pc to my breadboard in order to come up with a solution alongside my own driver and software to create a ram drive on my pc for the other machine to mount via the gutted SD card.
<br />
<br />i am going to gut a CF card first to combine with my breadboard and that PCB first in order to create a proof of concept, seeing as SD cards are possibly more complex.

<br />
<br />i meant the roms, not the nes.
<br />
<br />sorry for the confusion.
<br />
<br />using the SM-XC-CF it will be possible to use the FPGA in the PowerPak to pipe state info into the ram drive in real time, seeing as how a CF ram drive will have near zero latency.

<br />
<br />prolly because i actually don't have much of a clue what i am doing to start.
<br />
<br />no i have not researched what the chips on that board actually do yet.  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_eek.gif" alt=":shock:" title="Shocked" />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />all my electronics books were either stolen or obsolete.
<br />
<br />like, my books were FET based technology x.x
<br />
<br />and blatantly screamed white LEDs were impossible to make and that blue LEDs would most likely never happen.
<br />
<br />but that won't stop me, i will make prototype SM-XC-CF, SM-XC-SD, and SM-XC-S4021 cables, drivers, and software.

<br />
<br />that was a marketing scam in the 80s where if the LED failed they would replace it for free.
<br />
<br />the scam was they always claimed the user fried it theirself.

<br />
<br />i trudge thru what i do and simply sit pretty with the hopes reincarnation is in fact real so that one day i may continue working on all the crap i never figured out how to get to work or never had the time to complete in the first place.
<br />
<br />if you don't have any suggestions or actual ideas related to how to get the CF or SD cables i am planning to start physical work on next january, to actual allow a desktop emulated CF/SD ram drive to be mounted universally by any CF/SD reader, you can stop replying to this thread unless you have a question directly related to a post someone who actually has a clue about such matters conjectures or respond to a counter conjecture of some sort as posted by either a newbie or established member.
<br />
<br />so leave your attitude at the door and stop picking on me, as it's not good for the community to tear apart newbies that have a concept in mind but do not have the experience needed in order to not waste hundreds of dollars with failed attempts.

<br />BTW i can blow in my systems as much as I want. It's a dry 122F heat in Arizona, as any moisture in one's breath is a hallucination brought on by watching too much Dune in one sitting. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" /> If any the hardware will fail anyways when your a/c dies.
<br />
<br />In Arizona that's like telling someone not to give an Asthmatic with Pneumonia CPR.
<br />
<br />Kidding it's not that bad here.
<br />
<br />How do I clean Coleco-Vision controller sockets and plugs is what i need to know.
<br />
<br />I wanted to test proto on a CV too.
<br />
<br />but one of my two CV's port 2 is dead.
<br />
<br />for example, how do i clean the parallel ports in that 'dusty old board'.
<br />i don't think a blow can will work.
<br />
<br />i will check those out, thanks. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />
