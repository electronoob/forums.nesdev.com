Felix is not very dark, and Prince of Persia works correctly.<br /><br />The early revisions of all-in-one <a href="http://img-fotki.yandex.ru/get/5408/andreyp228.7/0_5a8ec_182ffcc3_orig" class="postlink">UM6561</a> have these problems.<br /><br />Old clones was really good. But all of them made before 1994.

Why it does not have the color emphasis bits, I do not know.

Instead of slightly darkening the other colors, they set R G or B to 255 for all pixels drawn.  Turn on all 3 and the screen is white.<br />There was a thread earlier about how to detect an RGB PPU.  Supposedly the RGB PPU doesn't skip 1 dot every other frame like the NTSC one does.

In fact when ccovell ran some other test on his Famicom Titler (RGB PPU), the timing of it DID match the composite PPU... so at the moment we don't know of a surefire way to test for it.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Sorry to be a pessimist again, but I don't think there's going to be any automatic way to detect an RGB PPU. Fortunately, the only gameplay-breaking difference between an RGB PPU and otherwise is the different behavior of the emphasis bits, and fortunately again, it's not gameplay-breaking if you only use one bit at a time, which is what Nintendo seemed to recommend anyway, and it might have been because of this exact reason in the first place.<br /><br />If you can live with the idea that your super sweet water effects are going to look different from console to console, then you have nothing to worry about. If you absolutely 100% can't, then you could include a &quot;Which type of NES do you have?&quot; menu at startup, since if someone has the knowhow to play your game on an <em>actual console</em> in the first place, they <em>probably</em> are already aware of the different PPUs and how they're incompatible with one another.<br /><br />If you don't want to do a menu, then offer seperate builds of your game; one for composite, one for RGB. Don't worry, because with 32-bit and 64-bit operating systems, we're all used to having seperate builds of the same thing for the same platform. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" /><br /><br />The reason I'm so pessimistic on this particular subject is because I don't think the effort of figuring out how to automatically detect an RGB PPU (which most people probably don't even have), either purely in software (likely not possible) or with a zapper (which is too much effort on the player, in my opinion) or whatever, it's not enough of a justification for how <em>little</em> of a benefit it would offer. Sometimes, things are just incompatible, and you have to compromise.
