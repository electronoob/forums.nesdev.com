		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Hi, I just started tonight reading 6502 Assembly and how to use it to put together an NES game. But I already hit a road block. I have Windows 10 and a Macbook with Windows 7 and I cant get NESASM to run on either, saying the program is not compatible with my machines. How do I fix this? Is there a version of the program that will run on newer WIndows machines?

For now though, try that and see if it at least runs for you.

Until someone writes another tutorial that's just as easy to follow using another assembler - or maybe even one that's mostly assembler-agnostic, with tips here and there for different assemblers - NESASM will keep being the go-to assembler for beginners.

That's how all forms of anti-bot captchas are defeated, and exactly why there are coherent posts.  The posts are on-topic to make them look as legitimate as possible.<br /><br />Am I the only one who has good gut intuition like this?  I'm baffled.<br /><br />I have a feeling I know what may be going on, as the spam greatly increased after the semi-recent server migration/upgrades that WhoaMan did.  But as before, I'm not going to talk about the technical details of &quot;how&quot; this stuff was filtered previously, because the spammers obviously read the board; you don't hand your enemy information they can use against you.

All I will say is that there is a &quot;style&quot; to the accounts being made and the data being posted.  <strong>It's not just the signature.</strong>  Even if it wasn't there at the time of the posting and added later (which we've seen before), that isn't the only hint.  I surely can't be the only one who's figured it out, can I?  Hard to talk about it when I **can't** talk about it.  :-)

It so useless, not seen when logged and maybe this is why it was added later since logged user never saw it when replying..</div><br />While I don't see the purpose of signatures on a forum either, disabling them wouldn't relieve this problem.  The spammer could accomplish the exact same result/goal by making a post, then later, editing the post to contain content that would normally be in said signature.  Sure, the edited post would say &quot;edited&quot; (if done within a certain amount of time), which doesn't get us any closer to solving the real problem.  :-)<br /><br />The only 100% reliable way to solve the problem is (if even possible) to make the forum like the wiki: new accounts are read-only until &quot;approved&quot; by an administrator.  For the forum, I'm not particularly a fan of this idea (while for the Wiki, I am a strong supporter of it).  When I helped run/admin the forum (that included direct access to the server), I used several tactics to greatly limit chances of spam from the same company/organisation.  Like I've said in the past, I can't talk about those tactics because the spammers understand English/read the forums, and I resigned from being an admin/moderator here many years ago.<br /><br />Captchas or signup questions (like what's on the forum here) don't really help when <em>actual human beings</em> are being paid to make accounts and post on forums.  The questions could be rotated monthly (it's a manual process by an admin and takes ~15 minutes to do), new ones replacing the old, but the questions are answerable by anyone who is smart enough to use Google.

The thing I notice about the accounts is something that anyone could notice, and it doesn't help in blocking them, but it *does* help in identifying them.<br /><br />As for blocking them: there is a separate board for forum administrators where some years ago I outlined how I went about blocking spammers (and what exactly got blocked every time I would add a new entry).  Where the block is done and how its done is different than where most folks would do it.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">Kasumi wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">If you have a plan for a sieve that the admins can put into place, then the admins can benefit from a non public document, sure.

Hardly something I'd be &quot;baffled&quot; that someone else didn't notice.<br /><br />If koitsu wants to educate me privately about what he thinks is suspicious here instead of responding directly, whatever, but that screenshot is how it looks from my terminal, and I see <em>zero</em> reason not to treat what I can see as if it was posted in good faith. (It's actually a pretty legit question if someone got here from the &quot;patater&quot; tutorial, which does indeed link to an old DOS version of NESASM.)
