<br />
<br />What you could do is get a Game Boy Advance (or Nintendo DS), a SuperCard CF, and several hundred homebrew ROMs off <a href="http://www.pdroms.de/" class="postlink">pdroms.de</a>.

Some times we can find very nice games. I'm not sure if they are complete, though... One of the guys who sells these things once asked me if the games were complete and I coudn't answer him...

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I've seen people selling nes pirate multis in the buy/sell forum over at digitpress.  I just think that if you want to buy a multicart a good idea would be to put a wanted ad in the buy/sell section at digitpress.com forum.  There are probalby many other places to go also, I've just seen them for sale there.
<br />
<br />I remember someone telling me that they found a multi and it had a super mario brother (smb) graphic hack.  It had a different title screen and then the only graphic different in the game was that mario was made to look like a cute bunny creature.  I think I saw a picture, but I'm too lazy to try and remember what forum that was on.
<br />
<br />pd is public domain.  I've seen 4 types of games on multi's myself.  1) A completely new game (not pd because I would assume that it's owned by the multi maker).  2) A completely new game but with stolen popular video game characters and maybe stolen gameplay too (street fighter for nes for example).  3)  A pirated commercial game that has not been edited at all.  4) A pirated game that has grapical hacks (from just a title screen to an adventure island hacked with mario graphics to make a "new" mario game).
