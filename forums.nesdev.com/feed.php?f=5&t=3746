Yes. N64 carts are pretty much Rambus chips, so they take a Rambus amount of power.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=9">tepples</a> — Fri Nov 30, 2007 7:20 pm</p><hr />

ok, understood.  So basically, these carts use more power than the old NES or SNES games so they needed additional grounding?<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3414">17daysolderthannes</a> — Fri Nov 30, 2007 6:17 pm</p><hr />

Would not risk it without proper sized grounding in some devices there is a high risk of fire, I had an xbox almost catch once because I did not screw down motherboard all the way before I tested it. I thought it was tight but it was not now I am always much more careful. <br /><br />The high current goes into the too small ground in place of the large one witch can handle it and runs the risk of burning them out (electricity will always go someplace if it can and will always take the path of least resistance)<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=188">peppers</a> — Fri Nov 30, 2007 6:08 pm</p><hr />

I thought dramatic titles would make people more likely to respond...?<br /><br />Anyway, fine grit sandpaper just takes the tiniest bit of material off, its just enough to get the stubborn dirt off of the pins without really removing too much material.  It's only as a last resort but it works.  If you take care of your games, you shouldn't have to do it more than once (when you first get it used).  This is the first game I've had to resort to this method.  The only other time I tried it was with a copy of Blaster Master that had a corroded capacitor (I found out later) so the capacitor was the problem, not the pins.  The pins on these cartridges aren't much different from the pins on an A/C adaptor, as long as you don't scrape them off completely you aren't doing much harm.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3414">17daysolderthannes</a> — Fri Nov 30, 2007 12:09 pm</p><hr />

Sandpaper?!? I'd use steel wool instead, if it were necessary.<br /><br />Also, try to avoid making such dramatic post titles; more people might respond. You used six of them: 2 help, 2 uppercase words, and two exclamation marks.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=17">blargg</a> — Fri Nov 30, 2007 9:47 am</p><hr />

well, I solved my own problem, I used the emery board and sanded the pins down ever so slightly and then cleaned the grit with alcohol on a q-tip and as far as I know its working 100%.  So keep that in mind, if you ever come across a non-working game and you open it up and everything looks good, you may need to sand the pins with a fine grit sandpaper to remove the gunk buildup.<br /><br />However, if anyone knows, does the metal case around the chip have some sort of function? it has a contact on the board where it screws on, so it must be used for SOMETHING.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3414">17daysolderthannes</a> — Fri Nov 30, 2007 8:57 am</p><hr />

I bought a used copy of Automobili Lamborghini off of Amazon (in other words, used N64 game) but I'm having some problems.  First off all, the system would not even boot at first, it even took me a few tries to get other games to work after inserting it, meaning the pins probably needed more cleaning (I always clean my games before trying them).  <br /><br />Well, it still didn't work so I used my security bit and opened up the cartridge.  The board looked OK but the metal case surrounding the chip had black marks where it contacted the cartridge port.  Is the metal case around the chip used for cartridge detection since it contacts the cartridge port on the sides?  At any rate, I tried to clean that to no avail so I used an emery ?sp? board and sanded them down slightly until they shined.  <br /><br />When I put the cartridge back together it seemed to work for a second but then the sound suddenly glitched BAD and when I tried to go to a race, it just crashed completely.  <br /><br />Should I try to also sand the pins? could 1 or 2 dirty pins cause sudden sound glitches and crashes going into the race? I got a little bit of rubbing alcohol on the chip by accident but I let it dry, could that cause damage? it wasn't much, just a tiny bit on the back side where the soldered pins stick through, just enough that it seemed to take some varnish off.  I was told by an electrical engineer on the benheck forums that he recovered a computer board by SOAKING it in rubbing alcohol, so I imagine a tiny bit on the board shouldn't hurt it, or so I would imagine.<br /><br />Please offer me any insight or assistance you can, I didn't think N64 games had the reliability issues of NES games, I really don't want to have to try to send it back because I know its going to cost more money than its worth, and I don't want to have to buy another copy either.  Also, I don't want to damage my N64 because I've had it since it was new and it's in immaculate condition.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3414">17daysolderthannes</a> — Thu Nov 29, 2007 7:50 pm</p><hr />
