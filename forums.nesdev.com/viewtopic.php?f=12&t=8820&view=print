		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I remember old EGM screenshots of Shadowrun showing slightly different dialog and item names for various things.  For example, instead of the release version's "Iced Tea" in the bar, it was a beer.  Does the GoodSNES ROM set contain this uncensored version of the game?  If so, what is the name of the file in that set?  I tried the (Beta) version of the game, and it is censored just like my actual cart.

I never played through the whole thing though (always get stuck  in the released version anyway) but there is some difference like the people at the morgue being referred as the Chop-Shop guy and Kitsune being a bit more slutty.

<br />
<br />Nintendo censorship shouldn't be a problem this time around, hehe.  What's cool too in one of their recent updates, they said they've got the composers of the SNES and Genesis Shadowrun soundtracks on board (Marshall Parker, and I forget who did the Genesis one).

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Yeah, I saw the kickstarter and was completely blown away by the idea. Kickstarter like this make me hope for the future when you see that a game development can be funded in a matter of 18 hour specially considering that this kind of idea would have probably been never picked up by a big publisher. I just went to check again and they have funded $1,554,545 in less than 30 days! The original objective was $400,000 so it's really incredible. Maybe it will start a trend and I hope it will. I personally can't wait to see some screenshot or video. They have completely funded the game by them self and will have total creative control of the project, imagine what these guy can do without any external pressure.
