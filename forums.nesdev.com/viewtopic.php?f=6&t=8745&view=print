		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Hello.
<br />
<br />Now I'm developing the Application so-called 2A03MML.
<br />
<br />It works on the Windows Phone 7.5 (and will be Android) to make chiptune with MML at logic of ppMCK.
<br />
<br />There needs 3 steps to make this Apps.
<br />
<br />1st We think about WP7 User Interface.
<br />2nd I want to use ppMCK. So it will need to convert with MML with
<br />MCK.This Application need to write in a MCK's grammar.
<br />3rd We need to make Emulation of 2A03(APU). Sound Emulation. This is
<br />really hard to our project and Eno san also really say it is difficult
<br />to make it.
<br />
<br />So if you interested in this Project Please contact to me!
<br />
<br />It will be take many things smooth with words using 2A03MML because there are so many spam mails send to me.
<br />
<br />I provide my Messengers Address in my profile and you can send message with twitter.
<br />
<br />My twitter account is @rana_music
<br />
<br />I want to be make interest and really nice Apps with many people who are not only Japanese!
<br />
<br />以上よろしくどうぞ！

<br />It was wrote in a C++.But We must use C# in WP' Apps.

<br />Plus there are a lot more Android users than WP7 users (I don't know if WP7 is super-popular in Japan, but I do know that both Docomo and KDDI offer several Android phones that sell really well).

<br />
<br />Actually it is not famous WP７in japan too.(or I may can say it is minor)
<br />
<br />But there will be some problem to developing Android APPs.
<br />
<br />There will need java knowledge to make this in Android.
<br />
<br />I can't use GME directly.
<br />
<br />And most important is  I want to use WP7 APPs.
<br />
<br />And Android is really difficult to apply patches when new OS release.
<br />
<br />It is too fast to develop Android Apps.
<br />
<br />Our developer Eno-san will be make Android Apps. Please wait to release from him.
<br />
<br />And alose it is my hobby project. I do the promotion of Japanese Music Company on daily work.
<br />
<br />That's all!
<br />
<br />Thanks!

Calls are billed to whatever account's SIM is in the phone, and you can still use the phone on a Wi-Fi network when the SIM is popped out.
<br />
<br />Not all cellular technologies use SIM cards. GSM/UMTS uses a SIM card, as does LTE. CDMA2000 can optionally use a CSIM card, but neither major U.S. network does; instead, they program the subscriber identity directly into the phone.

<br />
<br />Regarding the NDK, if you want, you can make the complete application in C++. This mean you don't have to write any activity code in java. 
<br />
<br />There is only one catch: this feature is only available since android 2.3 something.  If you want to target lower platform, you have to write at the least the glue code inside activity in java.
<br />
<br />On the japanese market, more and more phone support 2.3 so it shouldn't be an issue. Even the spring models are still 2.3, not even 4.0... It always depends who are you trying to target.
<br />
<br />@Tepple:
<br />
<br />As your comment with multiple tel with 1 sim, in Japan, usually you can only buy a phone with a contract.. They don't want to sell you the phone only so unless you buy a "contract free" phone abroad, it is difficult to do what you said. And the band between carrier are not always compatible (KDDI uses something completely different than Docomo/Softbank) so I don't know if you can switch card anyway. 
<br />
<br />And... 99% of smartphone are simlocked so you cannot use from another carrier anyway. Some your choices are quite limited.

<br />Replace "Japan" with "USA" and the company names and it's not so different here.
<br />
<br />Now back to the topic. Archos's Android-powered PDAs, such as the Archos 43 Internet Tablet, only go up to 2.2 (FroYo). In order to get anything newer until very recently, one had to pay a whole bunch more for an actual cell phone and a contract. For the first three years after Apple introduced the App Store, it felt like Google was giving the no-monthly-fee market away to Apple (iPod touch), Sony (PSP), and Nintendo (DS), until Samsung finally came out with the <a href="http://www.samsung.com/us/mobile/mp3-players/YP-G1CWY/XAA" class="postlink">Galaxy Player</a>, the first Android PDA to support Google Play (formerly Android Market) and Android 2.3 (Gingerbread). So if you require Android 2.3, you leave out everyone who bought an Android PDA before October 2011.

<br />I heard that there will br hard point to use NDK.
<br />
<br />It depends on the what CPU on the Android to use C++.
<br />
<br />Now I confusing what should I leran.
<br />
<br />
<br />&gt;tepples
<br />Thanks to your comment!
<br />
<br />There is various APPs to make MML.
<br />
<br />Putikon new version was released in japan recently and it can use BASIC.
<br />
<br />Now I want to make Android first. Because the japanese KEEI(au)'s support of Android is amazing.
<br />
<br />Then it will be seem to wait for Windows8 and then I will make APPs can work with MML.

<br />There are two kinds of CPU on Android-powered phones. Older phones have ARMv6; newer phones have ARMv7. There are a few instructions in ARMv7 that aren't in ARMv6, but a program doesn't have to be compiled with them to just work. Intel tried to make the x86-compatible Atom to compete with ARM, but Android standardized firmly on ARM long before Intel could get the power use down far enough to be competitive on anything smaller than a netbook. So compile your C++ code for ARMv6, with a bit of Java for the front end, and you should be fine.

<br />Blugged send to mail and said he has not develop APU anymore.

<br />Some how I want to completely develop this APPs.

<br />
<br />There will be takes many times. But I really want to use and make it.
