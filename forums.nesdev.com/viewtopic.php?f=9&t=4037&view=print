<br />Some other famiclones have a 60-pin jack designed for Famicom Game Paks; for these, you'll need an adapter with a 72 pin jack and a 60 pin plug, the opposite of what you find in a Gyromite cart.
<br />
<br />* Game Paks with MMC5 or other sophisticated mappers tend to depend on implementation details of the NES PPU, such as the order of memory fetches. Famiclone PPUs differ in some ways, throwing off the counter logic inside the mapper IC.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I agree, atleast it's not completely useless. But they have no interest in research and development, they just churn out the same NES on a Chip that every other pirate does. I think kevtris is about the only one to have actually gone and worked on a new NES clone in recent history. 
<br />
<br />It would be sweet if someone would clone it accurately atleast enough so complex mappers like MMC5 would work. But pirates certainly don't care and neither do alot of people. The NES on a Chip costs them nothing more than to make it. Making a new chip or design would cost them a whole lot of money they don't want to spend. And then you have the problem of even if you do make a better clone, will the market care? You have these idiots buying these cloned system without knowing their problems and often never noticing the problems themselves. Atleast not until they are pointed out to them.
<br />
<br />Anyway, buy the Yobo as a LAST resort. I find it hard to believe though that you can't find a NES or Famicom to use. The only excuse I thought was any good was the one where people would get a Yobo or something to use the Famicom Disk System. I can see that as it would be a bitch to connect to the NES. Still, the NOAC clones suck.
<br />
<br />To give you an example, Super Mario Bros 1 or 3 (I forget which) has noticably screwwed up music due to the NOAC doing duty cycles for the square waves wrong or something like that.
