This resulted in it hitting the market last in contrast to the other major players [...]</div><br /><br />I find the part I made in bold very surprising, this means the NES was supposed to have a very long lifespan, and was going to be Nintendo's only game console.

When the SNES was introduced, many parents (including mine) were sceptical of the reasons why they should buy a console with the super prefix and a higher price when they could by a regular nintendo for less. <br /><br />Trying to find an old news clip where this sentiment is voiced, but it seems i can't get the search terms right.<br /><br /><br />EDIT: Found it <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTzyz2TgGls">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTzyz2TgGls</a><!-- m -->

The absurd idea of technology as being disposable wasn't commonplace at the time.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">Bregalad wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">I find the part I made in bold very surprising, this means the NES was supposed to have a very long lifespan, and was going to be Nintendo's only game console. This is fascinating.</div><br /><br />Considering the context, I don't find this surprising, and I somehow always imagined it like that myself. At the time, the race for more powerful hardware wasn't really as prevalent as it would be following the 16-bit generation. In the 90s when the NES was still selling strong (hell, even after the SNES came out), no one thought of games like Super Mario Bros. as &quot;old&quot;, despite having multiple sequels already. It was just a video game. Just like Star Wars is just a movie. You don't watch Star Wars because you're a &quot;retro movie watcher&quot;.<br /><br />For the first few years I didn't even see the SNES as a &quot;replacement&quot; for the NES, despite its name, it was just another system, and I wanted both. The idea of new console generations replacing past ones was something that gradually built up.

I guess documentation was better in the 16 bit era?

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I think it's rather that when the famicom was released, very few available engineers in japan had any experience with the 65xx family of processors. The programmer who wrote Pinball for it was partly hired because he happened to use a commodore PET and as such was already used to write for its instruction set. By the advent of the SNES, it was a much more commonplace skill. Plus, you could write parts of a game in C. Also add in that the transition ought to be smooth (you might even be able to repurpose your inhouse library for use from NES to SNES even if the registers are a lot different). Moreover, the new processor offers the programmer the convenience of a fuller instruction set/larger internal registers, such as an 16-bit ALU and the <tt style="margin-left: 2px; margin-right: 2px; padding:3px; background-color: #3355aa; color: white;">Branch Always</tt> instruction, which likely causes fewer human error-type bugs, which in turns ought to save a bit of development time.

You have to make 2-3 layers of graphics, not just one, and somehow find a bunch of samples you can use.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Sure, but why phrase that like it's some kind of downside? Plenty of major developers already had similar experience with developing graphics for contemporary arcade games at that point, and sample-based synths were all over the place (not to mention sample-based music software - there are SNES games that literally use freely-available Soundtracker preset samples from 1987).

The &quot;out with the old, in with the new&quot; mentality just wasn't as prevalent at the time, no matter how fast technology was evolving. I mean, it was there for sure, but not in the same way as now where everyone is constantly waiting for the new stuff to come out and replace the stuff they bought last year.

Some of the more complex FM synthesis chips can be quite tedious and time consuming to program presets for, and i suppose those were the only cost-effective alternative of the time.
