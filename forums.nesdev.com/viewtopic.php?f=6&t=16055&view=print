	<tr>
		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Try as might, i've yet to find practical use of the 75%positive/25% negative duty. Theoretically, a fast music engine or support chip could perhaps toggle between 25% pos/neg at rates faster than the frequency of the tone to allow for more nuances in timbre or even PWM sweeps, that's all i can think of (but if that could be achieved, we could also AM/FM the pulse channels). But am i missing something that might matter when composing?

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />There is a practical use if you want phasing effects to behave differently. For example playing the same note, but with slightly offset pitch on two channels using 25% and 75% pulse-width results in a high-pass filter-sort of PWM effect instead of the usual phasing (it's recommended to retrigger the phase on purpose when you start doing this, however, so that you can get predictable results)

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />In general it does not have much obvious use.<br /><br />Unlike the other duty settings, that one starts high rather than at 0, so if you keep its frequency low enough and continually reset phase, you can use it as a crude 4-bit PCM via its volume control. Not sure why you'd want to when there's a perfectly good 7-bit PCM already, though.<br /><br />The ability to make 2 squares destructively cancel each other by putting them in phase an at 25% and 75% is also interesting. Aside from the limited musical effect this could have by carefully detuning one for short periods of time, you could also use it for timing tests via &quot;interferometry&quot;, etc.<br /><br />I've seen people use a duty macro that flips between 25% and 75% each frame for a sort of 60hz buzz + 25% tone instrument. Kind of an ugly sound for most purposes, but it is at least kind of distinctive.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />That's perhaps best reserved for short samples (perhaps percussives), and keep relatively long-ringing samples on the 7-bit side. Although.. 4-bit format will probably squeeze any punch out of the percussives
