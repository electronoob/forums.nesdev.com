I'm starting to reconsider the look of my game now <img src="./images/smilies/icon_lol.gif" alt=":lol:" title="Laughing" /> I also love how flexible your design is in regards to wall three dimensionality, but I feel like there are too many unique tiles required to draw all possible screens due to pattern overlap. How many tiles did you spend on your screens?<br /><br />I need to find a decent tool to create art, even something like a 1-point perspective corridor is difficult to draw using NES Screen Tool or YY-CHR.</div><br />Heh, thanks!<br />I was inspired by the visuals in &quot;Hired Guns&quot;, on the Amiga, and wanted to take a stab at wall height variation.<br /><br />Uh... It's been a while, but I seem to recall slightly tweaking the brick patterns to tile better at some point, and getting it down to 180-something tiles, more than enough room left for a basic interface (font + frame). Unfortunately, after <em>finally</em> upgrading to a new computer, I'm not really sure where the &quot;NES improved&quot; version of the CHR ever went.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">infiniteneslives wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">FWIW I feel uniqueness should be judged against all games prior to the compo, not against entries in that compo.

My own game was going to have dungeons built out of large cubes, allowing me to take advantage of the height variation, to create interesting environments, and Dungeon Master-like puzzles, with more obvious solutions (pushing walls to make bridges, anyone?). I haven't touched the project since I got the basic map parser working, though.<br /><br />The game would have had &quot;real-time&quot; combat, in a similar fashion to Dungeon Master.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I meant to post this last week, and forgot, oops.<br />For those curious on how to make a dungeon crawler with depth, here's a quick demonstration.<br /><br />First, measure a floor grid as usual, drawing lines to a vanishing point.<br /><img src="http://i.imgur.com/cYa2AxU.png" alt="Image" /><br /><br />Drawing the walls is easy, just draw a vertical line at the edge of each cell, like this.<br /><img src="http://i.imgur.com/j2Jbz6m.png" alt="Image" /><br /><br />For simplicity, I've done all the measurements, and here's the final result, for a standard wallset.<br /><img src="http://i.imgur.com/XpqVWyy.png" alt="Image" /><br /><br />Now, to add depth, just rotate the guidelines by 90 degrees, and lay it over the regular walls.<br /><img src="http://i.imgur.com/BAFyUkl.png" alt="Image" /><br /><br />You now have a cubic wall grid!<br /><img src="http://i.imgur.com/vaw3vIf.png" alt="Image" /><br /><br />For this example, I recreated one of my old screens, using this method.<br /><img src="http://i.imgur.com/UzJFwYF.png" alt="Image" /><br /><br />Once the guidelines are removed, this example only uses 57 tiles!<br /><img src="http://i.imgur.com/IaIva9p.png" alt="Image" /><br /><br />I could see somebody clever managing a Gold Box-like game within NROM limitations, and still having decent visuals.

It looks cool, I'll probably use a wireframe dungeon for something in my game.<br /><br /><img src="http://i.imgur.com/XAnPbMj.png" alt="Image" /><br /><br />Probably final Pattern ROM + palette configuration. I was trying to have each floor square have their own unique color but the transitions complicated everything, I could have had two distinctly colored floors but the UI would have had to reuse a color from the dungeon screen. Eww no. Right now I can have 6 different wall colors, a sky and ground (one of them is black), so it's all good. <br /><br />The far left/right walls occupy a lot of pattern ROM space so I decided to only have walls with entry #1 as their color... if the walls follow the &quot;Black; Dark tone; Light tone; Sky&quot; rule for their palettes it's ok, but if I really need to have all 6 colors to be dramatically different from each other I can just eat the pattern ROM cost and duplicate their wall tiles with the second color. For double tall blocks I'll just cheat and do a &quot;shadow&quot; transition with black to go around attribute clash, don't want to create yet another set of tiles.<br /><br />By the way, the far side walls look like fences because that was an failed attempt at dithering to make the wall look darker. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" /><br /><br /><br />Guess I have the screen arrangements well defined, time to start coding. <img src="./images/smilies/Mfr_icon_homebrew.png" alt=":beer:" title="Beer" /><br /><br />edit: I can't believe I didn't mention this yet... for those who are wondering, the sample text is not something I came up with, I just used my favorite videogame quote: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://68.media.tumblr.com/502770bc588f65f28b6ee36d66c82583/tumblr_mi3r2ssuYF1rc2ufoo1_500.gif">http://68.media.tumblr.com/502770bc588f ... o1_500.gif</a><!-- m -->
