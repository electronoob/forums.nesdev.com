They had succeeded with one game and then they did another with different gameplay, but the same general attributes.

Perhaps the big reason that you're more familiar with the control method in <em>Mario Bros.</em> than that in <em>Joust</em> and its clone <em>Balloon Fight</em> is that so many more games released after <em>Mario Bros.</em> have incorporated its control method, including most 2D <em>SMB</em> series games.

That's why I wrote that. Joust predates Mario Bros, but I grew up playing both around the same time. Neither was any less familiar than the other.<br /><br />In order to move left or right, the player must be mounted on a platform, a very vulnerable state, or must be flapping. In other words, in-air direction changes require the player to ascend at the same time; Balloon Fight borrows this mechanic and it's why Balloon Fight is Mediocre Joust With Stages. Different enemies with different AI occupy different regions of the screen, and the player has to be circumspect in response. In order to kill an enemy a player must collide with its lance higher than that of the buzzard, but upon killing an enemy the player is bounced up a bit, which could mean death from another buzzard above. On higher levels kills have to be somewhat planned and executed efficiently.<br /><br />Mario Bros is a fun game, but it doesn't even begin to approach the level of finesse and detail that Joust requires to be good at.
