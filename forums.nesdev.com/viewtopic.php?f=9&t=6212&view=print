<br />
<br />Assuming the datasheet(s) are correct, would you consider the NES a properly designed system?  
<br />
<br />I don't see a problem with it by looking at it from a schematic view, but I was hoping for a real world example and was worried the hold time may be too short.

<br />That's not exactly true. The problem is when you have fast clocked logic driven by slow logic; the fast logic will see the slow logic's leisurely level changes as multiple transitions. For RAM I suppose it doesn't matter, because multiple transitions don't do anything bad. But you can't in general mix really fast and slow logic together.

<br />I still don't 100% understand what the deal was with the sprite-DMA causing problems with my EPROM emulator (causing 1 or 2 constantly corrupted sprites).  IIRC kevtris had theorized that the DMA may be allowing some brief glitches on the chip enable, and if the PRG chip is fast enough it might respond to it.

<br />In any event, putting resistors in series with the data bus was the only way to fix that.

<br />Normally the 6502 puts M2 high only when the adress lines are stable, so even if a chip responds really fast to the low-&gt;high M2 transition, the adress are already stable.

<br />I can understand the glitches happening, but not sure I see how putting resistors in series with the data bus would help.  The RAM would still get enabled.
<br />
<br />I have enough RAM that I think sticking this on the CHR RAM side only will be good enough.
<br />
<br />Thanks for the help everyone.

<br />
<br />A lot of the boards use a series of cascaded logic to enable chips at different address ranges.  If you put a logic analyzer on the bus you can see the glitches.  Not really a problem with the CPU per se, just the timing of all the other logic.
<br />
<br />I don't expect that to happen on the NES, but everyone here has played with the HW more then me.  Plus anytime you are talking about a console like the NES you never know what tweaked out thing some manufacturer did in a game and rely upon.

<br />The resistors coupled with the capacitance of the inputs forms an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low-pass_filter#Electronic_low-pass_filters" class="postlink">RC low-pass filter</a>.
