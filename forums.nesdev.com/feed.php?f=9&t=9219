This is going to be much more obnoxious and probably more expensive than you want it to be, although you'll find some things are a little cheaper (parts) and some things are a lot more expensive (PCB) if you actually build a 12-up device.<br /><br />It sounds like you already read <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/viewtopic.php?t=9122" class="postlink">this thread</a>?<br /><br />Extending the concept to a 1-of-N device is straightforward, but won't have to use the same parts; you might find the 74'138/'238 (8 or 16 up) / '139/'239 (4 up) sometimes useful.<br /><br />Using a pushbutton to rotate between cartridges would probably be best done with with an analog debounce circuit on the button and a counter like a 74'161; other options may be better depending on specifics.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3512">lidnariq</a> — Tue Aug 14, 2012 1:20 pm</p><hr />

So for the past few days I have been researching as much as possible about the M82, now i am new to the whole NES modification scene and only have basic knowledge of circuitry. ( I at least can identify parts with a little poking around )<br />My questions are as follows:<br />1. is it possible to make a pre-cart boot system kind of like the game genie and the 100-1 units have ( menu system )<br />2. how to go about switching between the carts because I know for a fact that switching the +5v is not the answer (data lines drawing power as well)<br />3. a push-button counter switch circuit (having a hard time finding one)<br /><br />I have more questions and I am sure there will be more but I can't think of any at the moment, any help would be appreciated<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=5640">Captain419</a> — Tue Aug 14, 2012 11:50 am</p><hr />
