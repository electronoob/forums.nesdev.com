If they charge you taxes for the total value of the item... perhaps you can send it to me. I often do this for friends in Brazil. I can repackage it and take off the prices, send it in a small box and declare the value lower. Hopefully they will charge you less for it. If you are willing to try it, just let me know. Send me a PM if you want to set something up.

<br />
<br />ZIF sockets aren't that much. Search for "ZIF socket 28 pin" or 32 pin on eBay. You'll need 28 pin rom's / sockets for NROM/CNROM and some others, and 32 pin for more complex and larger games/data.
<br />
<br />I'll post more and answer some of you questions in detail later. I was thinking of making a tutorial for making simple devcarts - based on my reading on nesdev and my (limited) experience. Since I'm still new, I understand how it helps to have tutorials. However, I would only make a tutorial for things that I'm 100% confident with (there are enough bad tutorials on the net already).

<br />
<br />You'll want 28 pin.  The ZIF sockets on Sivava's site look possibly too big to fit though.

<br />
<br />I have four of them (AT29C256), and they work great! There are some posts on the Sivava forum about how people have trouble with them - but you just need to follow the correct jumper settings to burn them the right way.

<br /><img src="http://www.nesstuff.kit.net/p_surfari.jpg" alt="Image" />
<br />This is a pirate cart of the game "Thrilla's Surfari". I haven't played the cart yet but played a rom of it and it's a crappy game. However, the ROMs in there have the names of EPROMs, right? 27C1000 would be 128KB, as the ines header describes for that game (8 16k pages of PRG and 16 8k pages of CHR). Does that mean I could just swap these ROMs with EPROMs (or the flashroms you told me about) without the need for any rewiring? That would make it much easier to build a devcart!
<br />
<br />Also, the ines header describes this as a MMC3 game. I don't know how/if the pirates are faking the MMC3 and if I can trust this to behave the same as an actual MMC3. What do you think? Is this board a good candidate for a devcart?

<br />
<br />And I want to buy the following from futurlec:
<br />.2 28 pin ZIF sockets;
<br />.2 32 pin ZIF sockets;
<br />.2 AT29C256;
<br />.2 AT29C010;
<br />
<br />The 32 pin sockets and the AT29C010s are for the more advanced stuff I'll hopefully be trying later, Maybe with the cart I posted the picture yesterday. I'll check electronics stores near my work and see if there is any chance I can get at least the components, so I don't need to import them.
<br />
<br />Do you think this is a good way to get started on devcart making?

<br />Neither of those will fit, I bought a standard ZIF socket from Futurlec and it was useless to me because it's pins were too wide for any boards that I have.
<br />
<br />I'll start to sound like a broken record, but get an EPROM emulator, man!  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />
<br />It makes the best kind of devcart.  Unless you really want to burn ROMs and other chips the programmer supports.
<br /><a href="http://futurlec.com/EPROMEmulator.shtml" class="postlink">http://futurlec.com/EPROMEmulator.shtml</a>
<br />(I haven't used that particular model, I'm sure it'd work nice and fast though).  But sounds like it'd cost not much more than getting the EPROM burner + special ZIFs and chips, only advantage with the programmer is you could do EPROMs up to 1 megabyte and of course that the chips stay programmed.
<br />
<br />All you'd need with it is a few cheap standard sockets and a 512kB RAM ($5 at futurlec).  You'd use the RAM to replace CHR when you want CHR-ROM, just gotta wire up the CHR /WR signal to it.  It's a little easier to just use a CHR-RAM board.

<br />
<br />From what I understand, that is usually true.  However, true to form for a pirated cart, tokumaru's board incorporates the voltage-pump hack to "knock out" the NES lockout (authentication) chip; it doesn't need a CIC.  Its the two transistors, one capacitor, and three resistors in the upper-right hand corner of the board. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" />
<br />
<br />Personally, I'm rather curious as to what chip they used for the mapper.  I can't find information on that third chip (the non-EEPROM chip) anywhere.

<br />
<br />It's an MMC3 clone, there seems to be a lot of those.  I found one with a part # that shows up when I looked for it (AX5202P), but for all I know that could've been a fake part # on the chip too.

And I don't like CHR-RAM very much.<br /><br />Oh, and the software for it is for DOS. I'd have to go through the trouble of setting a DOS machine (or booting my current PC in DOS) and I'm not in the mood for this.

<br />
<br />You can do a 2-step process.  First step loads the CHR data into PRG, with some code to write to CHR-RAM.  Then upload the real PRG, and reset.  I set mine up to do that mostly automatically for loading NROM stuff.  It'd work the same for a big bankswitched CHR-RAM.
<br />
<br />The ROM emulator I have uses parallel port and seems to work fine in XP.  I'm not sure why, I expected it wouldn't.  It came with source to it's .exe also (in x86 asm).  It's way back from 1992 though.
<br />
<br />But yeah, the 128kB size limit for that one sucks.  Mine was 512kB and I payed about $200 for it a while back, really I was hoping to get a 1024kB one.
