Fair enough points. I've actually just finished reworking some of my code for loading iNES to prefer memory mapped file.

At the moment, libunif will refuse to consider files with a version &gt; 7 as valid. I have two choices here:<br /><br />1. bump the official version to 8 to make the ROM valid.

@tepples: I think perhaps you've misunderstood my plan <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":-)" title="Smile" />. But that's ok, I'll explain:<br /><br />What you describe is basically allocating enough memory and copying the PRG/CHR ROM into that memory and hashing it. This would work, but it requires extra memory. I'm not sure that I want to consider UNIF dumps to be duplicates of iNES dumps (at least not yet, I may be convinced otherwise).<br /><br />What I am thinking is this:<br /><br />suppose there are 2 PRG chips (PRG0 and PRG1) and one CHR0. Assuming the following:<br /><br />SHA1(PRG0) = A<br />SHA1(PRG1) = B<br />SHA1(CHR0) = C<br /><br />I would consider the hash of the UNIF dump to be:<br /><br />SHA1(ABC)<br /><br />This allows me to calculate the hashes of the chunks as I load them, and not worry about "making" them contiguous in memory. While still maintaining the following properties:<br /><br />* unique for each UNIF dump (disregarding meta-data)<br />* I can process the various ROM dumps in an image in the order which that appear in the file (which can be ANY order), no jumping back and forth.<br />* no need to allocate memory for all chunks at once and copy data around<br />* considered different from iNES dumps.<br /><br />The last two points are not 100% important, and I may be able to be convinced to let them go, but this scheme would work:<br /><br />Anyway, as for the part you aren't entirely sure on, I'll make it more clear:<br /><br />Suppose we have 2 dumps the first with the following chips/hashes:<br /><br />dump #1 has PRG0 (16k)/PRG1 (16k)/CHR0 (8k)<br /><br />SHA1(PRG0) = A<br />SHA1(PRG1) = B<br />SHA1(CHR0) = C<br /><br />dump #2 has PRG0 (16k)/PRG2 (16k)/CHR0 (8k)<br /><br />SHA1(PRG0) = A<br />SHA1(PRG2) = B<br />SHA1(CHR0) = C<br /><br />Note that it is PRG2, <strong>NOT</strong> PRG1. I don't want these two dumps to be considered equal. But if I just do as I originally planned:<br /><br />SHA1(ABC)<br /><br />They would be...but, if i include the "PRG0\x00\x00\x40\x00" as part of the byte stream that I hash for the PRG chunk, now which chip it is, is part of the "uniqueness".<br /><br />Essentially, I would like the hash of identical code found on different chip indexes to be considered different. I know almost all ROMs only have PRG0, but who knows what exotic cart we'll find next <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";-)" title="Wink" /><br /><br />I know this is a corner case, which is likely not happen... But I think since it is easily addressable may as well deal with it. I have a couple of variants on this theme in mind, but that's the general idea. Include the chip#/type as part of the secondary hash and it will be truly unique.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=4806">proxy</a> — Thu Apr 14, 2011 8:27 pm</p><hr />

Another update <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":-)" title="Smile" />.<br /><br />So, there is a bit of a flaw in the way that GoodNES handles UNIF dumps. Basically, as far as I can tell, GoodNES will always try two things.<br /><br />First, skip the first 16 bytes, hash the rest of the file. if that doesn't match anything in the DB, then hash the whole file and see if that matches the DB.<br /><br />So, as you can imagine, UNIF always falls into the second category. The problem is that any two roms can have different meta-data but have the same PRG/CHR.<br /><br />Here's my proposed solution:<br /><br />I load the UNIF file into memory and process the blocks. I hash every PRG[0-9A-F] block in numerical order. I then hash every CHR[0-9A-F] block in numerical order. Non existent blocks have no effect, but you can have discontinuous blocks like PRG0, PRG2, but no PRG1.<br /><br />I am thinking of making the hash include the UNIF block header so that an image with PRG0 and PRG2 wouldn't match an image with PRG0 and PRG1 where PRG1/2 are the same code. I know this is a corner case, but it's worth addressing if I can.<br /><br />Then I concatenate the results in the order I collected them and hash <strong>that</strong>. Now we have a unique hash for UNIF files which will correctly identify that two file are the "same" but may have different meta-data. This now opens the possibility to correct bad meta-data such as the MAPR/MIRR/etc blocks similarly to the fixnes feature. This is necessary since at least one UNIF image in the GoodNES collection has a bad header making correct loading impossible.<br /><br />Any thoughts? Anyone see a problem with this approach?<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=4806">proxy</a> — Thu Apr 14, 2011 3:04 pm</p><hr />

I wouldn't mind seeing NESToy resurrected to use the BootGod/GoodNES/no-intro databases that have been fixed.  NESToy also did a good job of keeping a compressed archive of iNES headers that could patch the ROM images.  Without an iNES header the binaries are effectively useless.  Qualms with GoodNES and no-intro databases excluding iNES headers or not fixing them has rendered people collecting giant masses of ROMs while some of them are unplayable unless you add your own headers fueled by personal research and experimentation.  Some people without the knowledge of the iNES header format would consider the image to be broken, when in fact the utilities are lacking.<br /><br />Again we're also on sketchy ground when it comes to Parodius and NESdev board terms.  It seems that we allow linking to ROMs on occasion, especially if they are unreleased or of broad interest, but the database preparation and ROM collection efforts of the community to get a functional and accurate NES/Famicom game database once again would be traipsing on a gray area.<br /><br />I believe as long as people attempt to not directly link copyrighted ROM images in the forum, but link using PMs or other personal communication means to exchange images for databasing purposes, release databases in the public forum, and let it be known without a public link that the image archive is hosted in a torrent on Underground Gamer, that the NESdev community would have a complete and accurate image archive for reverse engineering, hacking, and emulator development.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3466">B00daW</a> — Tue Apr 12, 2011 9:03 am</p><hr />

Since when did the author of Elite get the authority to claim copyright away from the publisher and liberate it?  I thought it was still considered a pirated copy, despite the author releasing it.<br /><br />Edit: Looks like the game itself attributes copyright to the developers, not the publishers.  Then it's okay?<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=53">Dwedit</a> — Mon Apr 11, 2011 9:33 pm</p><hr />

Given that commercial roms don't "change" as frequently as homebrew roms, the open GoodNES utility should have its main focus on commercial, non-public domain roms. As such, I think it shouldn't include any homebrew roms, save for ones that may have actually been "dumped". <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" /><br /><br />Handling homebrew roms that are subject to updates and such would require a different solution, such as checking against an internet database, because that would be the easiest way to propagate updates.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=21">Drag</a> — Mon Apr 11, 2011 5:16 pm</p><hr />

<div class="quotetitle">proxy wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"><br />So I have a question with regard to iNES 2.0. Has the submapper stuff been hashed out, is there any "authority" out there which has designated them? Currently, the way that I <strong>imagine</strong> them is something like this:<br /><br />Mapper 4, Sub 0 (MMC3/MMC6 Generic/Unknown)<br />Mapper 4, Sub 1 (TBROM)<br />Mapper 4, Sub 2 (TEROM)<br />Mapper 4, Sub 3 (TFROM)<br />Mapper 4, Sub 4 (TGROM)<br />etc...<br /></div><br />If the board can be reliably guessed from the size of PRG ROM, CHR ROM, PRG RAM, and CHR RAM, it does not need a submapper. For example, all MMC1 boards with 512 KiB PRG ROM, 8 KiB PRG RAM, and 8 KiB CHR RAM behave the same way as SUROM.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"><br />Mapper 2, Sub 0 (UxROM use 8 bits for PRG swap, supports much larger games)<br />Mapper 2, Sub 1 (UNROM use 3 bits for PRG swap)<br />Mapper 2, Sub 2 (UOROM use 4 bits for PRG swap)<br /></div><br />These can be reliably guessed from PRG size.<br /><br />As for junk at the end: You might want to put in detection for when the appended data looks like a zip file.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=9">tepples</a> — Mon Apr 11, 2011 1:27 pm</p><hr />
