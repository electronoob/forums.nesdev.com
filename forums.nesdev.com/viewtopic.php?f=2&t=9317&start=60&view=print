But from what I'm told the power pak's isn't so great.  It tends to jump back and forth a few scan lines on some games...  So keep that in mind, it's not necessarily the mmc3 as much as it's the power pak.</div><br />This might have been true back when PowerPak was released, but I haven't had any problems like that with the loopy's latest mappers (or my own save state mappers). Still good to keep that what you said in mind of course.</div><br /><br />I can't say for sure as I don't own a powerpak but someone came to me privately asking about Ninja Gaiden 3 specifically:<br />1. When you actually start the game, you have the health stuff on top and the &quot;action part&quot; below. The &quot;action part&quot; is what shakes.<br />2. After you go through the first exit, the shaking doesn't happen on the action screen, but I notice a line or two is missing from the bottom of the health bar. <br /><br />I saw similar issues with my implementation of the MMC3 and realized the issue is CHR A12 being noisy as it's a poor clock source.  Nintendo apparently had the same issue and added the 220pF cap to filter the signal.  I added the cap to the NESDEV1 and it solved the issues.  I suggested to this fellow to do the same with the powerpak and he also claimed it fixed everything.  Perhaps he had an older powerpak and the capacitor as since been added IDK, but I don't see how this issue could be solved via mapper configuration inside the FPGA.

Of course this involves a bank switch mid frame to select the appropriate animate frame for the pattern data.  I got it to line up but when scrolling it seems to lag behind 1-2 frames then line up when the scrolling stops, as if it's not completing the bank switch before the frame is over.<br /><br />How long does a CHR-ROM bank switch take with MMC3?

But the bankswitch happens at the end (EDIT: ~mid cycle might be more accurate) of the CPU clock cycle in which you write to $8001 &quot;data&quot; register.  So to answer your question I'd imagine you'd count the CPU cycles in your code from when the interrupt occurs until you write to $8001.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />The CHR bankswitch is instantaneous after the CPU write completes, but there is still a lag because the PPU buffers up to 16 pixels ahead of the current dot.<br />12 pixels between starting the instruction and the instruction finishing, then (depending on when the write finishes and fine X scrolling) between 5 and 16 pixels will be remaining in the shift register, and will use the old graphics.<br />So it's anywhere between 17 and 28 pixels of lag.  Plan for the highest number.  If the write finishes by dot 309 (begins by dot 297), there will be no glitches.

Just a matter of computing the proper BG tile animation offset and getting the CHR-ROM bank switch right to keep the BG layer aligned and scrolling together to give the illusion of being one seamless layer.  Sky tiles in the top animating very slowly... rock tiles animating faster, and then the &quot;two&quot; foregrounds scrolling at diff rates. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />I don't know why I'm having so much fun with this.  I almost think it's more fun than SNES, GBA, and PS2 just because the hardware is so limiting.  Seeing &quot;3&quot; layers on a NES is hilarious.  Nothing beats the PS2's DMAC though.
