		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />With a vblank bandwidth like that, I wish more Master System games would animate background patterns to create richer visuals... But most games stick to updating only the player's patterns. Some SMS games have really good background art when compared to the NES, because of the huge advantage of 4bpp tiles, but they tend to be mostly static, which kills the mood a bit. NES games with CHR-RAM also rarely animate backgrounds, but many CHR-ROM games do it, and it makes them look more advanced. If more SMS games had such animations, some could even pass for 16-bit titles.

My general impression of 16-bit games is that the backgrounds are more full of life than in earlier platforms. Palette cycling is often a part of it, but I'm sure that many update patterns as well.

Yeah, that aside, there's emulation. You don't use emulation?<br /><br />PCE is one of those rare instances where the addon <em>became </em>the main system about halfway through its life span. If you only play Hucard games, you only get a glimpse at early titles - the evolution of games finish taking place on the CD medium. PCE = hucard <em>and </em>CD games. Some early games strattle that 8bit-16bit genre/design. Some devs treated it as 'nes with extra features', as Chris Covell would phrase it, so the range of game design runs the gamut on the system - more so any MD or SNES (competing systems of the era). A lot of PCE games have more of an early 16bit feel, than an 8bit feel. But I wouldn't call it SMS like. Except for some late gen SMS games, SMS games are pretty 8bit in design and <em>feel</em>. Some late gen SMS games, like some late gen NES games, feel closer to early 16bit stuff (or SNES games, minus the fancy graphics. SNES games in general don't put a lot of enemies on screen at once. SNES has pretty colors, and but isn't a very 'fluid' system of the era. MD reigns in that department, with PCE seconded, snes last). Dracula X on PCE has like 3 times the amount of animation compared to the SNES 'version'. Nothing on SMS comes close to Street Fighter 2 'CE on the PCE hucard, let alone the Neo Geo fighting ports to the PCE CD. Top tier SMS games are no where close to top tier PCE games. Top tier SMS games don't even equate mid tier stuff on the PCE.<br /><br /> Some early hucards that were popular (in the US released in '89-90):<br />Bloody Wolf<br />Ninja Spirit<br />Dungeon Explorer (5 players at the same time)<br />Splatter House<br />Legendary Axe<br />Legendary Axe II<br />Neutopia<br />Blazing Lazers<br />Rtype<br />Devil's Crush<br />Aero Blasters<br />Bravoman<br />Cyber Core<br />Psychosis<br />Military Madness<br />Side Arms Hyper Dyne<br />Space Harrier<br /><br /> ^I wouldn't say any of those reminded me of SMS games when I was playing them. The didn't play like SMS games, or look like SMS games, to me.

Games like Astérix and the Great Rescue, Deep Duck Trouble, Chuck Rock II, Daffy Duck in Hollywood, Aladdin, Cheese Cat-Astrophe, Gunstar Heroes (this might be GG only, but still), Masters of Combat, and so on, are damn impressive for an 8-bit console, and definitely comparable to PCE titles.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">Some late gen SMS games, like some late gen NES games, feel closer to early 16bit stuff (or SNES games, minus the fancy graphics.</div><br />Being an artist, graphics is the first thing I'm going to compare, so I find it kinda hard to consider NES games comparable to early 16-bit stuff, due to the extremely low color count.

The PCE looks pretty cool, but from what I've seen, there are lots of questionable games, and games with uninteresting graphics. For a system with so many palettes, I find it surprising how hard it is to find PCE games with outstanding graphics... Most games I see look just OK, compared to a lot of incredible stuff you can find on Genesis and SNES, but not because of hardware restrictions, probably just lack of talented artists (and lack of third-party developers to add variety and raise the bar). The SMS also has trouble breaking that graphical threshold, because of both hardware and talent, but the final result is that I end up seeing some similarities between it and the PCE. Not a whole lot like they're equivalent in every way, but still somewhat similar depending on the games I'm looking at.

I would put the complexity of the gameplay as part of the 16bit era. Gimmick on the NES feels and plays like a 16bit era game. Matter of fact, it kinda feels like devs took to take a step back in gameplay complexity in the 16bit era - instead focusing on simplistic interaction with larger sprites instead. So in that respect they have more in common with later gen 8bit games (NES here) - just larger sprites. At least on the SNES. Megadrive games seemed to always be pushing that boundary - pushing around way more sprites.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Note: this is getting highly off-topic!<br /><br />Sure there are cases where the PCE compares favorably to the MD or the SNES (from a quick look at that page, I can say this is the case of Lords of Thunder and Raiden, for example), but that doesn't necessarily mean that the graphics are particularly groundbreaking on any of the platforms, or on the arcade originals even. A lot of games in that page are arcade ports, so there's not much originality there, it's often the port that's most faithful to the arcade original that wins the battle, and the PCE undoubtedly has decent enough video capabilities to pull off nice graphics, so it can usually compete against the MD and the SNES despite having a single background layer.<br /><br />If you really want me to, I'll try and list some MD and SNES games I consider to have groundbreaking graphics (most games will probably be exclusive to a single console, meaning that the games were designed to take advantage of that specific hardware, instead of adjusted to fit), so you guys that know the PCE much better than I do could give me some examples of impressive pixel art on that console, that isn't based on games from other platforms.

Even when it came to RPGs, which don't require parallax. If I were to post pics showcasing graphics, it would only show what the system is capable, rather than what's representative of typical, average, or even top tier stuff on the system. You'd have to take the time to play through the library yourself (hucard and CD), and not spend just a few minutes with each game.<br /><br /><img src="http://www.pcedev.net/pics/nearearth/afsss1.png" alt="Image" /><br /><img src="http://www.pcedev.net/pics/nearearth/afsss2.png" alt="Image" /><br /><img src="http://www.pcedev.net/pics/nearearth/afsss3.png" alt="Image" /><br /><img src="http://www.pcedev.net/pics/nearearth/afsss4.png" alt="Image" /><br /><img src="http://www.pcedev.net/pics/nearearth/afsss5.png" alt="Image" /><br /><img src="http://www.pcedev.net/pics/nearearth/afsss6.png" alt="Image" /><br /><img src="http://www.pcedev.net/pics/nearearth/afsss7.png" alt="Image" /><br /><img src="http://www.pcedev.net/pics/nearearth/afsss8.png" alt="Image" /><br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">Stills make the PCE look better than it is because the biggest thing missing from the PCE graphically is parallax scrolling.</div><br />The biggest achilles heel of the system. So much so, they tried to fix the problem before the SFC came out with the PC-Engine SuperGrafx. But, original games didn't have to suffer from the lack of parallax as much as they did. With sprites, hsync scrolls, and dynamic tiles - most original dev'd games could have been more parallax capable than they were. It'll never be on the level of systems that have more than 1 BG layer, but it could have been more that what's the norm is for the system.

The one thing PCE has over NES and SMS in this sense is more sprite overdraw.
