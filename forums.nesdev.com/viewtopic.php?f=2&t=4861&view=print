<br />
<br />This is for my ''Project 2'' (an Improvement SMB hack with new graphics and levels). This will be used with the ''Rescue Princess/Mushroom Retainer'' text routines
<br />
<br />Until SNESdev grows more and WLADX's lable problem is fixed: SMB1-SNES's status is ''Frozen Indefinately''

Or just randomly delay, as the player will probably not notice. Many games make a sound only for non-space characters, and some even add delays as a more dramatic punctuation (probably embedded with an escape code in the string).

<br />Hamtaro is not some newbie. I would not say the same thing to someone that just showed up. He is a fixture here. He's always asking strange things expecting some magical answer of some sort. This is a special case.

<br />
<br />I think this case is different but I cannot confirm what happened before so I cannot properly judge it.  People are usually nice with new comers on nesdev.  If they show any willingness of learning and it asked in a proper way, they get a proper answer.  
<br />
<br />In that case, this is a "special user" that as been here for a while, always asking questions that sometime make no sense. Not because it's not asked in a proper way, he's just asking for something that is impossible or request that you should code the program that he need, jumping from one project to another, mixing technologies for no apparent goal etc. So it's hard to know if he's serious or not.  
<br />
<br />If he just came to nesdev, I guess that would have been quite a harsh thread and would agree with you but this not the case.  He's just being his usual self so you shouldn't worry too much about it. After a while it can get irritating.  Usually I'm quite cool with that and ignore those messages, just snapped once and wrote something that I could consider harsh (not too proud of it).  
<br />
<br />Just hope someday that we can see something he did so we can confirm how serious he is.

<br />But one might argue that if you make a demo, you have to draw your own CHR, and that's a whole separate set of talents. I'd guess that's part of why some people stick to hacking commercial roms.
