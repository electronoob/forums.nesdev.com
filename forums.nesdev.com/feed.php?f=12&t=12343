Alright, so...  I can't say if an open source version of this is ever coming.  I looked into converting it to LibreOffice but the short answer is that converting it is impossible and it will have to be entirely rewritten in a different language, probably python.  There is support for Excel VBA, but it's not fully implemented and probably never will be.<br /><br />I wish I could say that I'm going to take the time to redo this open-source, but when I think about how much time that takes out of my actual SNES programming I don't know if I can follow through.  What I can do is post a new and improved version of my excel sheet, for those that can use it if any.   (It says it was downloaded 15 times, hopefully at least one of those people found it useful.)<br /><br />To give a better idea of what it is and how it works, I figure I'll just describe it all right here:<br /><br />------<br /><br />The basic idea is you have worksheets for tile editing (128 pixels wide by 32 tall, could be made taller) where each cell represents one pixel.  You type a colour value (0-F) into a cell and the cell is automatically coloured with conditional formatting.  This makes editing very easy to do, and allows you to copy/paste and move blocks of pixels around conveniently.  <br /><br />There is a main &quot;Palettes&quot; worksheet which contains a full set of 16 palettes of colours.  Each tile sheet also contains a custom palette of colours in SNES Hex format below the drawing area.  You can choose (using macros) whether the conditional formatting will draw from that palette, or one of the 16 palettes on the &quot;Palettes&quot; worksheet.<br /><br />The macros included are as follows:<br /><br /><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">CreateBlankTileSheet</span></strong> - Self-explanatory, creates a new blank tile editor worksheet.<br /><br /><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">DrawTileSheet</span></strong> - Resets the conditional formatting of a tile editor worksheet to display the tiles in any of the 16 palettes on the &quot;Palettes&quot; sheet, or the custom palette on the tile sheet.  Can be used in 16 or 4 colour mode:  4 colour mode is for BG palettes only (0-7) and interprets palette numbers as the SNES would (ie/ Palette 1 begins at colour 4).  <br /><br />(You can have multiple palette sheets, but note that the &quot;DrawTileSheet&quot; function will always reference the one titled &quot;Palettes&quot;.)<br /><br /><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">DrawPaletteSheetFromHex</span></strong> - Updates the colours on the active palette sheet according to the hexadecimal values entered.  <br /><br /><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">DrawPaletteSheetFromCellColors</span></strong> - On a palette sheet, you can colour the cell to the left of the colour number (the &quot;Pal #&quot; column) using Excel (Format Cells &gt; Fill, Ctrl+1 is the keyboard shortcut), and then run this macro to update the Hex values to match that colour.  This allows you to generate hex values for colours you select visually.<br /><br /><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">ImportPaletteSheet</span></strong> - Creates a new palette sheet from the specified input file.  Must be a text file and generally must be formatted the same as the output of &quot;ExportPaletteSheet&quot; (no indentation, &quot;.dw&quot;, one full palette per line).<br /><br /><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">ExportPaletteSheet</span></strong> - Exports all 16 palettes of the active palette sheet as a .inc (text) file.  The file contains two labels, &quot;BGPalettes:&quot; and &quot;SPRPalettes:&quot;, each of which are followed by 8 palettes in &quot;.dw&quot; format.<br /><br /><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">ImportBitmap</span></strong> - Creates a new tile sheet and imports the selected 16-colour (Windows-format) bitmap file into it.  Loads the palette inside the bitmap file into the tile sheet's &quot;Custom&quot; palette.<br /><br /><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">ExportTilesAsBitmap</span></strong> - Exports either a single tile or the entire active tile sheet as a 16-colour (Windows-formatted) bitmap file.  User is given the option of white, black or custom background colour.<br /><br /><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">ExportTilesAsInclude</span></strong> - Exports the active tile sheet in .inc (text) format.  Can be run in 16 or 4 colour mode as desired.  Gives the user the option of including the custom palette in the same file as well.<br /><br /><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">SwapColour</span></strong> - On a tile sheet, swaps every cell with a specified colour for another colour.  (For example, enter A then B and every cell containing A will be overwritten with B.)<br /><br /><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">RefreshSheet</span></strong> - Mostly useless.  Occasionally the conditional formatting wouldn't take effect for me.  This macro just forces it to by re-writing the value of each cell.<br /><br />------<br /><br />The only thing you need to do before you get started is <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">set the path to save to</span></strong>.  It defaults to &quot;E:\SNESDev\&quot;.  If you want to change it, you need to edit line 3 of the VBA module, which you can access through Developer &gt; Macros &gt; Edit.  (If there's no &quot;Developer&quot; tab at the top you need to enable it under File &gt; Options &gt; Customize Ribbon, on the right side.)<br /><br />The only thing I can think of to improve this is to possibly add an &quot;ImportTilesFromInclude&quot; function, but I have had no need of it yet since I do all my editing in excel...<br /><br />Would love feedback if anyone has it.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=6817">Khaz</a> — Thu Feb 19, 2015 9:15 pm</p><hr />

As a bleak update, please don't hold your breath for me to finish the .ods format of this.<br /><br />Even with a whole lot more searching and reading, a lot of answers I need simply don't seem to be out there without literally contacting the people who wrote the program.  What I have ALMOST works exactly as-is but the little finicky differences in what LibreOffice will accept is maddening.  As of right now it is having seemingly self-contradicting problems in handling objects.  For example, in MS VBA to assign an object to a variable you generally have to type &quot;Set thing = Object&quot; rather than just &quot;thing = Object&quot;.  But if you use &quot;Set&quot; in Libre it doesn't work, but then you take the &quot;Set&quot; out and it just gives you a different error.<br /><br />I don't know Libre's macro language and I honestly just plain don't have the patience to learn it right now; not without a full listing of the objects they use and their internal parameters and functions.  I mean, lacking that, programming is almost literally impossible.  And while I'm at it I will state for the record this is precisely why I LOATHE programming anything at a level higher than assembly:  You REQUIRE someone else to tell you in infinite detail exactly how these libraries you're using work, or else you'll lose an entire lifetime debugging in the dark.  Microsoft's MSDN for Excel VBA is downright exhaustive and it STILL usually isn't enough for me to figure out these kinds of problems.<br /><br />Long story short:  An unregistered version of Excel 2010 will continue to function exactly the same after it's &quot;trial period&quot; has expired.  If you have access to such a thing I recommend it.  In the meantime I cannot bring myself to waste any more of my very short life on this conversion until I have some more complete resources to work from.<br /><br />EDIT:  Sorry for my earlier frustration.  I'm not giving up.  Just don't hold your breath, it might take a while.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=6817">Khaz</a> — Sat Feb 07, 2015 9:06 pm</p><hr />

.xlsm is a MS Office format, the LibreOffice formats are .odX.  If you're saving a full spreadsheet, it's .ods.  I'm not sure if there's a file format for saving just a macro by itself.  Saving as anything other formats will, of course, drop the macros because they don't support them.  If you're editing within LibreOffice, it's best to stick with the native formats rather than trying to export/import the MS formats, as sometimes things will get lost in translation.  Also, the LibreOffice forums are a great source of information.  If you can't find what you're looking for, ask.  <a href="http://ask.libreoffice.org/en/question/7131/conditional-formatting-within-a-calc-macro/" class="postlink">This might be relevant to your conditional formatting issues.</a><p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=5348">qwertymodo</a> — Thu Feb 05, 2015 6:28 pm</p><hr />

I've used LibreOffice before but I wasn't aware it supported those kinds of macros.<br /><br />After doing some experimenting most of what I have works just opening it in LibreOffice Calc without any changes other than removing the &quot;Application&quot; in &quot;Application.InputBox&quot;.  A couple relied on a Collection for hex conversion (hC) that doesn't work in Calc for no apparent reason, but it's easily cut out and replaced with manually substituting A-F for 10-15.  Conditional formatting and cell colouring looks like it'll have to be completely rewritten though and I have no idea how to do it in calc and I can't find any decent documentation of their API (sic) for it and I can't find the record macro feature either because it's not where they say it is in the options menu.<br /><br />And then I accidentally closed the window only to find that all the macros I just edited for a couple hours are now GONE.  I have no idea what the hell happened.  I opened and closed it several times between editing before with no problems.  And now I don't want to even try without knowing for certain that it's not going to just lose everything all over again.  I also don't even know what format I'm supposed to save it as, .xlsm isn't one of the options but if I change it then it seems to drop all the macros and all the formatting.<br /><br />I keep trying to switch to alternatives like LibreOffice but to be honest it does something stupid like this to me every time I use it.  And unlike MSOffice, searching for answers online will almost always get you nowhere...<br /><br />EDIT:  My version of LibreOffice is somehow hilariously out of date.  I will try again, after some kind of break.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=6817">Khaz</a> — Thu Feb 05, 2015 6:17 pm</p><hr />

You might look into Open/LibreOffice.

I could theoretically look into learning python someday...  Though a large part of what's so efficient about this setup is having the spreadsheet integrated into the program.  I'm not sure what would be involved in interacting between something like python and a spreadsheet program.  I suppose the practical advice then would be to skip the middleman and not involve a spreadsheet, and just write my own software...  But then we get back to how my tool is probably redundant, if I could only figure out how the other dozen I tried are supposed to work.<br /><br />I'm not sure when I'll have the motivation to put more into this since what I have is working for me quite nicely, but we'll see.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=6817">Khaz</a> — Wed Feb 04, 2015 9:58 pm</p><hr />

I wanted to share something I've created that may be potentially marginally useful to some people.  I encountered a lot of frustration while originally searching for tools to help with creating SNES sprites, and though I spent a good full day just trying every bit of software I could find nothing seemed to be good for simply editing tiles and converting between a visual and assembly format.  So I made a spreadsheet and some macros, which seems to be my solution to everything these days.<br /><br />Notable features include the ability to import from and export to 16-colour bitmaps (up to 128px wide x 32px tall though could be expanded), exporting as a &quot;.inc&quot; text file of bytes, converting cell colours to two-byte hex values, switching between different palettes and exchanging colours.  And honestly, I just find it so much easier to edit in spreadsheet form than any software I've ever used.<br /><br />The only setup required is to tell it where to save files to.  The root path is a global variable at the top of the visual basic file.<br /><br />If you think it's useful, feel free to suggest other features that could be included.  If you think it's redundant then I'm open to suggestions of what to use instead.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=6817">Khaz</a> — Wed Feb 04, 2015 8:45 pm</p><hr />
