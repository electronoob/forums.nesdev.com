I've run across a hack to Vegaplay by Grapeshot but I need some advice.<br /><!-- l --><a class="postlink-local" href="http://forums.nesdev.com/viewtopic.php?f=3&amp;t=9102&amp;p=96897#p96897">viewtopic.php?f=3&amp;t=9102&amp;p=96897#p96897</a><!-- l --><br />  I have a simple test FT 0.4.3 song that uses VRC7 and 2A03, no bank switching, less then 10K. I export to .NSF (FT doesn't export exp chip to .NES). Using Nestopia the NSF plays fine.<br />  I follow the the procedure for Vegaplay, getting the Load, Init and Play addys. Edit the vegaplay.asm, strip the header out of the .NSF file and compile. The resultant .NES NROM plays the 2A03 fine. Now I change the iNES header to Mapper 85 and Nestopia chokes on it; blank screen, no sound but no error message. Also tried Nintendulator with the same result. The two Header bytes @ offset 06 and 07, from $00 $00 to $50 $50. <br />  When I load up one of Grapeshot's VRC7 vegaplay NES', it plays fine. The post I ran across was 1 1/2 yrs old and seems he was using FT &lt; ver 0.3.8 so I tried the build with FT 0.4.0 but this didn't help. Do you think I need to revert to an even earlier ver? but I need HW VRC7 compatibility which was fixed as of 0.3.8.<br />  Any ideas what went wrong? Am I missing a setting in FT?<br />Yogi<br />EDIT fixed title <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />

The weird thing is: only changing the mapper bytes in the header fouls it up. With no NSF bank switching going on  it shouldn't make a difference, at least in my mind <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br />  Don't know if I'm fighting a EMU problem or a FT issue.<br />I'll add an edit to vegaplay for the banking regs; but the older Grapeshot NES didn't seem to need that?!? He did have a modded vegaplay.asm for MMC5 that did this, so may be that's the problem.<br />Yogi

It will crash in most other emulators because the mapper is not initialized.<br /><br />Your ROM does not work because you aren't initializing the mapper.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />OK, there's two problems here. First of all, Famitracker 0.4 doesn't export all NSFs with a load address of 0x8000, instead it puts the load address somewhere in the 2nd or 3rd 8k. I'm not sure why this was changed, but it leads to the second issue, which is that FCEUX maps the VRC6 banks differently than Nestopia or Nintendulator do at startup, but all 3 map the first and last banks in the same place, it's the second and third that are different. <br /><br />So the result is: a NSF made by Famitracker 0.38 and compiled by Vegaplay with only the mapper bytes changed will work properly in all 3 emulators if it's less than 8k, but if it's larger it only works in FCEUX (So my previous NES files only worked coincidentally.) A NSF made by Famitracker 0.4 series then compiled by Vegaplay will only work in FCEUX, regardless of size. I'm going to write some init code for the mapper to fix this, but it'll take me a bit to test it.<br /><br />Also, does anyone know if the actual initial values for the VRC7 have been tested by anyone? It isn't listed on the wiki.

(and presumably on hardware).<br /><br />FCEUX (2.2.1) doesn't intentionally initialize anything at all. On powerup, the <tt style="margin-left: 2px; margin-right: 2px; padding:3px; background-color: #3355aa; color: white;">preg</tt> array isn't initialized in code, so it instead falls back to the bit where global variables are initialized to 0. It sure looks to me like it should be the same as Nestopia...

I exported and read through the code but I will need many more passes over the code to understand it well enough to use it ATM. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br />  What would you say is a viable location for the player code? vegaplay loads it's self into the top 2K of the PRG rom which isn't too bad but there is no guarantee that a NSF wouldn't be mapped into that space. It would result in an unplayable NFS?<br />  I was going through Loopy's PowerPak NSF source a bit and it loads low, somewhere around $40?? Which is safe but complicates mapping. <br />  I guess I'm wondering what a reasonable ROM size would be for the basic Play/driver and where to put it. Looking at the vegaplay code, Load and Init aren't very big and the Play is a simple call to the nsf play address driven by the NMI. So the bare bones seem very slight. I'm just a bad judge; don't know what I don't know.<br />Yogi

If you need to bankswitch DPCM, you probably want to keep it out of $C000-DFFF, but other than that there's no good or bad place for it; just depends on your other needs. The ASM or BIN export is just a block of music data, separate from the driver. It can also be located anywhere you like.<br /><br />The only documentation for it is included with the driver source itself, though I did write this guide a long time ago: <a href="http://famitracker.com/forum/posts.php?page=1&amp;id=3681" class="postlink">http://famitracker.com/forum/posts.php?page=1&amp;id=3681</a>
