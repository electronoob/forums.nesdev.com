I guess we finally have the answer to what the Karate Kid music is doing in there.<br />Hidemushi, a programmer of the game, left behind a really nasty message for his coworkers.  You need to enter a convoluted secret code 30 minutes after the ending to see it.  Then it plays Karate Kid music, and shows the message.<br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://magweasel.com/2009/08/29/hidden-messagin/">http://magweasel.com/2009/08/29/hidden-messagin/</a><!-- m --><br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"><br />Mmm, that’s a nostalgic song playing. Those were good times. Meanwhile, who the hell are these people with this project? I’m so glad it’s over. You think it’s nothing but good memories? Hell no! Let’s use this space to give out some thanks.<br /><br />    First off, Kaoru Ogura, who ran off with some guy in the middle of the project. Yes, you, you bastard. Don’t show up at the office without showering after having sex 6 times the previous night. Next, Tatsuya Ōhashi. Yes, you, you bastard. Don’t give me your flippant shit — coming in late on the day we ship the ROM like nothing’s amiss. You can give me all the porn you want; I’m not forgetting that one. All that fucking weight you put on. No wonder you paid out 18,000 yen and still got nothing but a kiss out of it. Kenji Takano, Namco debugger. You are a part-timer; don’t dick around with the project planner. And finally, Kiyoharu Gotō, the biggest thorn to my side in this project. Yes, you, you bastard. Once I get a time machine, I’m sending you back to the Edo period. Go do your riddles over there.<br /><br />    Ahh, that’s a load off…wait, no it’s not. Kiyoharu Gotō — yes, you, you bastard. Aaaagh, just disappear already.<br /><br />    Come to think of it, some people were helpful to me, too. Mr. Okada, who took all the good stuff. I know all about your abnormal tendencies. Yamagishi, who swore off soaplands until the project was over. Go ahead, knock yourself out now. Iwata, who joined in midway and gave it all he had. Sorry I yelled at you. Keep hanging in there. Fujimura, Udopyu, you probably had it the worst of all. Thanks. I mean it. Gotō’s the one to hate here. Also, Takayama, Kudō, Suzuki, Makki, Kaneko, Aihara, Sato (the angel of my heart), Iga. Thanks, everyone.<br /><br />    Yoko-G, good work. This game is dedicated to your wife’s birthday.<br /><br />    Kazumushi, I’m sorry I couldn’t come back home much. I love you and always have. Hidemushi<br /></div><br /><br />Kaoru Ogura, one of the few female programmers in the industry, programmed the minigames for Karate Kid.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=53">Dwedit</a> — Wed Jan 27, 2010 2:51 am</p><hr />

Wow. You're right. Could've been the same developers. I remember X Men uses some of the exact same sound effects from a FDS game called Topple Zip. Maybe a lot of the movie based games from LJN were actually Japanese developed.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=216">ArnoldRimmer83</a> — Tue Oct 10, 2006 3:13 pm</p><hr />
