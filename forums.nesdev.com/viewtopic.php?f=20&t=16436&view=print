		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I think the flickering in <em>Batman</em> and <em>Serpent</em> is an intentional translucency effect, if <a href="https://forums.nesdev.com/viewtopic.php?p=192995#p192995" class="postlink">ccovell's comment</a> is to be believed. It wasn't noticeable on the original Game Boy because the LCD was so slow. Have you tried enabling frame averaging (also called motion blur) in these emulators to simulate a slow LCD?<br /><br />I have a working Game Boy Color, tested with <em>Space Invaders</em> two days ago, but a copy of <em>Serpent</em> on eBay would cost about $12.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />For the cart flasher, I got mine from BennVenn. He's based in Australia if I recall correctly, so for you it's international shipping regardless. <a href="https://www.tindie.com/products/JRodrigo/cart-flasher-for-gameboy-/" class="postlink">There's this flasher</a> from someone based in Spain, so that might be more favorable to you. Unfortunately, both BennVenn's and JRodrigo's flashers are sold out. I think JRodrigo is restocking this month; join the waiting list now if you're interested.<br /><br />As for flashcarts, an Everdrive is the most expensive option, but you can buy them from resellers everywhere, even in Europe (I remember seeing it for sale at UK and German based webstores). It's very pricey though. BennVenn has a very good flashcart called the ElCheapo, but once again, it's sold out. The GB USB 64M Smart Card is sold literally everywhere (US, HK, UK, EU) and if you're looking for an European seller, I think Retro Towers has them (UK seller).<br /><br />I'd buy a flashcart first and foremost. You can put ROMs on a flashcart without needed a dedicated cart reader/writer; most flashcarts are USB or SD based. A cart reader/writer is mostly useful if you're in my situation (64M Smart Card user on Linux) or if you want to example real saves from real Game Boy carts.

	<tr>
		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />If you're going to be writing your own tests, having (close to) 100% compatibility isn't really an issue. That is to say, if you want to do your own low-level tests of hardware behavior (the actual Game Boy, not the MBC itself) you often don't need anything much fancier than 32KB of ROM and maybe the ability to save. So, the GB USB 64M Smart Card is perfectly fine, despite the fact that it needs patches for certain games.<br /><br />As for regional differences between Game Boys, I don't think there are any. The hardware is essentially the same, except the stickers on the back. I think the only thing that probably is different is the Super Game Boy, but that's technically SNES stuff.
