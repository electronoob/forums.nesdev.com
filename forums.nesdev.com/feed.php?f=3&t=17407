Hi all - yes, yet another beginner emu in progress. <br /><br />I'm comparing my execution against FCEUX trace logs, so that I can be sure I don't have any bugs. I'm using the SMB1 NTSC rom.  My problem is where the vblank flag changes (yes, this same old issue..)<br /><br />I have all the cycle numbers, instruction numbers, registers, flags, and  instruction opcode numbers matching the FCEUX trace logger output for the initial 6 instructions and the alternating LDA $2002/BPL $800A all the way up until a flag change happens.<br /><br />I know vblank flag should be set at scanline 241 / dot 1.   To me that first hits at total ppu dots in frame == 82181, and cpu tick 27394/instruction number 7828.  I believe that one is skipped.<br /><br />The next scanline 241/ dot 1 hits at the same ppu dots # in the frame, cpu tick 57174/instruction number 16337.<br /><br />Therefore the trace log line of instruction 16339 is the first one where the A register changes to 90, e.g. the 0x80 flag is read in.  That is my first log diff with FCEUX trace log.<br /><br />In FCEUX's log, that doesn't happen until the line on cpu tick 59679 / instruction 17053 - so 714 instructions later.<br /><br />I correctly have a total of 89342 dots per frame.<br /><br />There's only a handful of instructions running up to that point and the cycle numbers/instruction numbers match, so there must be a bug somehow in the timing but I can't imagine what it would be given there's not much going on.<br /><br />If anyone can check the math in their own project, I'd appreciate it - I have tried digging around other emulators to breakpoint where this would happen and look at the numbers, but I'm trying to stick with one I can compare trace logs with and I find FCEUX very hard to figure out the code for.<br /><br />Thanks for your help..<br />-rel<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=9205">relaxok</a> — Thu May 31, 2018 9:56 pm</p><hr />
