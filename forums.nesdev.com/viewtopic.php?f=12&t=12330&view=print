		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />The only 65816 C compilers I know of from back then was ORCA/c, the zardoz toolchain and TMorita's lcc retarget (which used ORCA/m for the assembly/linker backend).<br /><br />They (TMorita) supposedly used C for Zombies ate my neighbors. There was also this obscure japanese puzzle platformer that blatantly used the zardoz compiler (bought by wdc, called wdc816cc these days).<br />I've heard rumors that square used C in some of their later titles, still haven't seen anything that confirms this though.<br />Ballz 3D might have been written partially in C, it does a lot of things that imply that C was used.<br /><br />Yes, it's possible, why do you want to know?<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">tomaitheous wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"><div class="quotetitle">tepples wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">Possibilities: [list][*]<strong>If you see C format strings, then C was likely used.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />For the avoidance of doubt, by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Printf_format_string" class="postlink">format strings</a> I meant strings with format specifiers like &quot;%d&quot; and &quot;%s&quot; in them. These are what Nova found. True, an assembly language implementation of a subset of <tt style="margin-left: 2px; margin-right: 2px; padding:3px; background-color: #3355aa; color: white;">sprintf&#40;&#41;</tt> called by pure assembly language could also use format strings. But Koei was trying to target multiple platforms with different instruction sets.<br /><br />So let me add a fourth heuristic:<br /><ul><li>If the game came out on in several instruction sets (68000, 65816, and whatever the F else), and its code isn't tightly optimized, and it doesn't use a bytecode platform such as SCUMM or Z-machine, C was likely used. </li></ul>

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Of note that a game programmed in assembly would be more likely to use sentinel values (a non-character value, e.g. 0xFF) than stuff like &quot;%d&quot; in strings, so finding printf-style formatting can hint at it being C (if the program also uses the stack heavily, chances are that's indeed the case). Also having a subset means nothing since games made in C for those consoles usually would have their own implementations of the standard functions and even then only the stuff that was needed (IIRC Sonic Spinball only implemented three format specifiers, for example - yes, I know that isn't SNES but point stands =P).
