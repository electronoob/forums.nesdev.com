<br />
<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">Main:<br />&nbsp; ; Some code<br />&nbsp; JMP Main</div><br /><br />and then place your controller code to just move around a sprite or something it will go ridiculously fast. I've always used a 'timer' mechanism to control the speed of the game play:<br /><br />In my main loop I have:<br /><br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">&nbsp; LDA Timer<br />&nbsp; BEQ MainDone</div><br /><br />At the end of Main it resets Timer to equal 0.<br /><br />In the NMI I have:<br /><br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">&nbsp; LDA #$01<br />&nbsp; STA Timer</div>
<br />
<br />This effectively controls the play speed but is this the most common method or do you use something better?

So you should set a flag after your NMI routine that tells your main loop to do another frame. That looks like what you are doing as far as I can see. I'm sure there are other ways of doing it, but that's what I've been doing.
<br />
<br />There's only way to vary the "timer" is to just update every other frame, but I think that the best way to change the speed of objects is just to vary their velocity.

<br />Most programs use this kind of solution, what varies is how the flag is set and cleared, if it's a flag or a counter, that kind of stuff. But the basic rule, that the NMI is the one to indicate when it's time to process a new frame, doesn't change.

<br />One of the alternative methods is to run the whole game logic inside the NMI, so at the end of the game code, instead of waiting for a flag to change you just RTS to the main loop, which is just an empty "Forever: JMP Forever" loop. When the next NMI fires, the next frame will be processed.
<br />
<br />Both the other ways I'm aware of has the NMI modify a flag, but one also performs graphical and other important updates inside the NMI, while the other simply returns from the NMI, letting the responsibility of updating the PPU to the main loop.
<br />
<br />All solutions, except for the one that performs important updates inside the NMI, will result in music slowdowns and possible graphical glitches in case your frame calculations take longer than a frame to complete. So guess which is my preferred solution? =)

<br />Ah, I see... Yeah, I guess you could to that without problems. It's just my preference to do the waiting at the end, because by that time the frame is already processed and the buffers with all PPU updates are already to be used when the NMI fires.
<br />
<br />If you wait at the start, or do all the logic inside the NMI, you have to deal with the case where during the first frame the NMI fires and there is no data to write to the PPU, becaue the frame hasn't been processed yet. Not that this is a problem at all, since we usually have a flag indicating if the updates should happen or not.

<br />Do you mean "AND #$03"? What you have there will ALWAYS branch since whatever counter is, it's just going to get two bits set which is always non zero.

<br />
<br />edit: that only detects a CPU loop that took more than TWO frames, so it's probably not very useful... I suppose you could check bit 7 of $2002 at the beginning and end of the main loop which would detect a CPU loop that took more than one frame in most cases.

<br />Not it wouldn't... That flag only stays up during VBlank, and since VBlank doesn't last very long, if your logic took longer than a frame to complete, the chances that it also goes over the time of VBlank are pretty high...
<br />
<br />At the end of my main loop, I set a variable indicating that all the logic has completed, and the NMI uses that to decide if it should update the PPU or not (it doesn't if the frame logic isn't complete), but I could also use it to detect when I missed a frame... Every time that the NMI fires and the frame calculations aren't complete, a variable can be updated to count the number of dropped frames. I don't expect to miss more than a frame at a time though...

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />What is the point in counting the frame updates missed? I don't think that there will be much you can do about it. Generally I think a good way to control "play speed" is having your main program set a flag after all game logic and PPU update buffers are done. Then the next time NMI rolls around it will see this so it will execute the updates and reset the flag letting the main program know it is time to move on. Your NMI if it saw no update was ready for the PPU could just skip over that but still update your sound engine. 
<br />
<br />I forget which games do it, but some have bad music distorting/slowdown when the game slows down because they do not update the music engine every 1/60th second if the game is slowing down due to heavy cpu load. You should avoid this.

<br />...and status bar, if you have one, don't for get that. If you don't set up the IRQ or wait for the sprite 0 hit necessary to properly position it, it will jump/disappear, and those are very unpleasant effects to look at.
