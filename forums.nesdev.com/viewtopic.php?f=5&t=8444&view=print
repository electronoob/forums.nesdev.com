<br />
<br />Does it sound like I have way too much free time on my hands, or does it sound like something you guys do in your spare time when your board?

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />It's what I did when I was 13... designing things like the "Debug Booster", a TurboBooster-shaped device for the Turbografx that had switches connected to every pin on the TG expansion board, and it allowed game hacking, modification, etc.  All on paper only, of course.
<br />
<br />I also remember designing a Turbografx-III, something more powerful than the SuperGrafx and it took a dual-layered HuCard (imagine two Street Fighter II' PCE cards glued one on top of the other) because of its immense power.
<br />
<br />It's not a bad hobby.  When you're 13.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Sounds kinda like me. I mostly reimplement or document existing systems through schematics, but sometimes I have an urge to work stuff like a '70s style display controller using minimal discrete chips just to see what I could have come up with were I alive then. Over time the projects have piled up and some of the more recent ideas are becoming grandiose, plus I do the same with software, so for example lately I've been putting hours into designing a modern operating system which I'm sure is crazy. I guess it's all part of the learning process.
<br />
<br />I think if you like designing systems then cool, it's only pointless if you abandon your ideas because of other people. Implement one in a FPGA then keep improving on it. For a while I was thinking about an original arcade system, something like the Cave hardware which is still successful despite being 2D. I gave up on that idea but I took some things away from it.

<br />
<br />Not any more.  FPGA dev boards are relatively cheap these days.  For under 200 bucks you can get a very decent one that has RAM, flash, video, audio, SD card, ethernet (I think) and other doo-dads.
<br />
<br />I highly recommend using Altera parts and staying away from Xilinx, simply because Altera's quartus software is so much nicer/better than webpack ise.  This is personal pref of course, but I've been using quartus for 7 years or so now.
<br />
<br />For a dev board, the DE series by terasic is very nice and cheap.
<br />

<br />
<br />$150 (or $125 if you get the academic discount, which I hear is easy to get) for a really nice board that is more than enough to do an FPGA NES and then some on.
<br />
<br />That board has SRAM, SRAM, flash, VGA, audio and tons of other goodies.  
<br />
<br />
<br />The DE1 level of FPGA'age is good enough to implement all the FPGA consoles I've done so far (8 or 9) and I have yet to run out of resources.
<br />
<br />Shameless plug:  Since I finished the FPGA NES, I have gone on to implement these ones too:
<br />
<br />* SMS/GG
<br />* Colecovision
<br />* Atari 2600
<br />* Intellivision + Intellivoice + ECS
<br />* Odyssey^2 + the voice
<br />* Supervision
<br />* adventure vision
<br />* Mandelbrot renderer (I have code released for that in verilog)
<br />
<br />All of those consoles are 100% finished and run every game made.
<br />Currently I am working on SPC700 and hope to start on SNES some time.

<br />Can you elaborate more on what were looking at?
<br />
<br />BTW, no hobby that teach you something could be described as stupid even if you never build the thing you were working on. Thing and project end up on shelf/garbage years later, knowledge stay forever (or until you get senile <img src="./images/smilies/icon_lol.gif" alt=":lol:" title="Laughing" /> ) When I was 8, me and 2 buddy of mine were working on building a time machine. We were doing sketch of the machine and discussing it a lot. It seem though that I was the only one really intending on building it as I remember salvaging junk electronic in the street (remember a watch I found and was very excited about that I was planning on de-assembling and saving the LCD for a time display in the machine <img src="./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=":wink:" title="Wink" /> ) and also remember feeling so betrayed when one of my 2 friend got confused about me talking about it all the time and picking up stuff for it and told me he wasn't really thinking of building one now but in the future when we are grown up. Upon hearing that terrible confession, I lost no time in luring him in my tele-transporter and fused that Judas with a fruit fly that was in the pod. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_twisted.gif" alt=":twisted:" title="Twisted Evil" /> I tought of selling the right for the movie but Jeff Goldblum was unavailable at the time <img src="./images/smilies/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt=":roll:" title="Rolling Eyes" />
