		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />My idea of using a single sprite for 2 bullets would also work for bullets up to 8x8, using 64 different 16x16 sprites. If priority between bullets matters you'd have to use 128 of them (which starts eating a lot of VRAM).<br />But yeah, it's limited to 256 sprites and they should be close to eachother by pairs for this to work.<br /><br /><br />Otherwise, the only thing I see is simulate a BG layer with large sprites and have the GSU or whathever chip draw to this &quot;BG&quot; layer while the background is done with mode 7. Then you're limited in colours for all the sprites. I think you can do this with 8x7 = 56 sprites of size 32x32, then you're limited to 16 colours in a 32x32 pixel area. Pehaps it's managable if you use 16 colours for the playfield, and then customize the sprite arrangement for the side status bar.$<br /><br />Nevertheless, the effect of a BGMODE write during scanline still has to be tested.

The bullet engine, collisions, and rendering are going to be plenty intensive by themselves, and I don't want to have to nerf the bullet patterns to fit extra logic into the GSU program (or skimp on the extra logic and end up with a less accurate port) if the CPU could have handled it.  The precise division of labour is of course TBD, but I don't think the bullet engine needs to be all <em>that</em> tightly coupled to the game engine...<br /><br />Besides, I'm already dubious about fitting all the graphics and music into 16 Mbits, so it's probable that I'll need a chunk of what the manual calls CPU ROM - ROM that's not behind the GSU and can't be accessed by it.  And if I need that extra ROM anyway, why not put code in it?<br /><br />I think it's more elegant to have both processors doing what they do best as far as possible.  Still, I'm probably way too new at this to say for sure yet.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">Sik wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">May want to release the source code of the test ROM so others can mess with it easily in case the test is not correct or there's something else to be tested.</div><br />That sounds like a good plan, once I've got something worth posting.  Right now I feel like I should do a bit more investigating myself - I've had a bit of trouble with other people's DMA macros...<br /><br />I did manage to get an IRQ to change the brightness at a point on each scanline.  So once I get DMA working properly (or just give up and poke all the data in manually), I should be good to go.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">byuu wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">The really obvious one is your HIRQ will not trigger at an exact cycle point each scanline.

I guess WAI isn't as unpredictable as actual game code...<br /><br />Regardless, if this were to actually work I would happily accept the necessity of masking any such seam with sprites.  As long as, y'know, it doesn't glitch out the OBJ layer...<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">Bregalad wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">Otherwise, the only thing I see is simulate a BG layer with large sprites and have the GSU or whathever chip draw to this &quot;BG&quot; layer while the background is done with mode 7.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Okay, I managed to get the data for both modes into VRAM at the same time without having to manually transfer all of it.  Anyone who cares to can investigate why the DMA for the Mode 7 data doesn't work - I've tried writing out the method myself, and I still get nothing, or at most an array of pink dots in no$sns (higan gives me nothing regardless).<br /><br />Whatever.  This works.<br /><br />Here's a screenshot using brightness as a proxy for screen mode, so as to enable testing in higan.  The top half is mode 1, two layers, and the bottom half is mode 7.  All three backgrounds use a single tile.<br /><br /><div class="attachtitle">Attachment:</div><div class="attachcontent">

		<br />
	</div><br />Altering the IRQ to target $2105 instead of $2100, and removing the mid-screen mode change during HBlank, produces a primitive test of mid-scanline mode switching behaviour.  It <em>kinda</em> works in higan (which is unexpected, and renders the above exercise slightly pointless), but not well enough to be useful:<br /><br /><div class="attachtitle">Attachment:</div><div class="attachcontent">

			<span class="gensmall">modeswitch_higan094.png [ 4.7 KiB | Viewed 211 times ]</span>
		

		<br />
	</div><br />Yeah, the right-hand side of that keeps jiggling back and forth.  Going from Mode 1 to Mode 7 does the same thing.  With real game code messing up the IRQ timing, it would probably be worse.  And resetting $210D and $210F to zero doesn't help...  it kinda looks as though it's using the mode switch as a horizontal baseline, instead of the actual beginning of the scanline...<br /><br />Hopefully this is just an artifact of how the dot-based renderer was coded, and a real SNES will do a better job.  If not, I may have to try messing with scroll registers and matrix registers, and see how well <em>that</em> works in Mode 7...<br /><br />...I wonder if I could try to use the H-position register as a scroll reference during the interrupt...  okay, no, I will find out what the behaviour <em>really</em> is before trying to fix it...
