If you do it in the beginning of your vblank handler, it's a fool-proof method, whereas manually uploading the sprites has some quirks (depending on what address $2003 ends up at, etc). Also note that your little 16 iteration loop already takes almost 256 cycles, whereas uploading full 256 bytes with OAM DMA only takes about 512 cycles, so there's not much of a performance gain.<br /><br />In this case, since your sprites are in ROM, you can copy them to RAM outside of vblank, then OAM DMA the RAM during vblank.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />It is almost always a better idea to use the DMA for your sprites. There is not enough time in vblank to update all of OAM through $2004, and if you turn rendering off the sprites begin to get corrupted as the OAM RAM decays. If you only need to update a couple of sprites per frame, you can get away with a few $2004 writes to update them in vblank, but you still need to fully initialize OAM whenever rendering has been off, which either needs to be done with a DMA or through $2004 over several frames of vblank.<br /><br />Yes, it's a large chunk of RAM, but it's essential.<br /><br />If you're looking for a bit more RAM, you might not be using part of the stack area. $100-180 can be a good place to squeeze a few more bytes in.<br /><br />Also, if you have a static screen that doesn't need to change, you can DMA sprites out of ROM. If you do want to avoid having an OAM copy in RAM, you can a DMA from ROM in the first vblank to initialize, and then little updates via $2004 in subsequent vblanks is okay.

If your program isn't doing anything fancy but still fails on some emulators, it's worth checking out what the issue is. Even if it works on original hardware, you could be accidentally doing something without a safe margin of error which could eventually fail under some circumstances. Better safe than sorry.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">rainwarrior wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">If you're looking for a bit more RAM, you might not be using part of the stack area. $100-180 can be a good place to squeeze a few more bytes in.</div><br />Definitely. People often look at the OAM page and think memory is being wasted there, but how many program do you know that need 256 bytes of stack? I don't think I'd ever need more than 64, and that's if I use the stack for temporary storage of arrays. If I use it only for subroutines and passing values I doubt I'd ever use more than 32 bytes.<br /><br />Anyway, you can still use the OAM page for variables if you use 3 bytes and skip 1 (the Y coordinate) every 4 bytes. The Y value is necessary to put the sprites offscreen, and the other bytes can be used for variables. You won't be able to use arrays or values larger than 24 bits, but I'm sure you can find space for those elsewhere and keep the simpler variables in the OAM page.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />You might end up using a lot of stack if your game uses a recursive algorithm such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flood_fill" class="postlink">flood fill</a>. Examples of flood fill in commercial games:<br /><ul><li>Segmentation of the playfield into separate connected regions that fall independently (<em>Bombliss</em>; <em>Mega Man X</em>) </li><li>Segmentation of the playfield into indoor and outdoor regions (<em>Rampart</em>) </li><li>Determining how many like pieces are touching, if it takes a critical mass to clear them (<em>Puyo Pop</em>; <em>SameGame</em>; <em>Tetrisphere</em>) </li><li>Determining how far to extend an explosion, though this is often done incrementally (<em>Exodus</em>; <em>Magical Drop</em>) </li></ul><br />But in the vast majority of cases I can think of, $0100-$01BF should be free. I tend to use it for a &quot;transfer buffer&quot;, where code running during draw time builds data to be copied to VRAM during next vertical blank.

If you don't have any sprites at all, then you can avoid using that RAM too (possibly, some screens might use sprites, but other screens might not use sprites so that RAM is available for other purpose during that time). Regardless, you should use the OAM DMA (which is a APU register designed to interface with the PPU, which is a separate chip) if you are using sprites at all.<br /><br />And you can use the part of RAM for sprites also for variables as long as the Y coordinate of the sprite is off-screen. On a few mappers it is also possible to use sprites to switch the CHR bank between the top and bottom half of the screen (I think).
