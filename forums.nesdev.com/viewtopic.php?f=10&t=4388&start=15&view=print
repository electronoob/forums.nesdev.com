And also, you'd get SRAM, which is basically a bag of gold for someone who's run out of RAM. It's also good because I have a polygonal movie engine that I'm revising/optimizing, and it requires 5k of RAM for a copy of the PPU data. SRAM allows for this.
<br />
<br />You'd also have the scanline counter. Though limited, it can be great in some aspects. For more information, go to <a href="http://nesdev.com/bbs/viewtopic.php?t=4340&amp;postdays=0&amp;postorder=asc&amp;start=0" class="postlink">This thread</a>
<br />
<br />And you'd get a great amount of PRG space, though a lot of it might be dedicated to CHR data.

<br />SRAM is a very important factor with a great impact on the complexity of a game. Although 2KB allows for a fair amount of complexity, it's not enough to hold data copied from ROM. In complex games, the engine has to keep track of so many different things (object definitions, level maps, sets of metatiles) that are much easier to work with when copied (or possibly decompressed, which saves ROM) to RAM. If there is no RAM for those things, you have to pack them all in the same ROM bank, without the possibility of combining them in different ways, and use part of the addressable space that could contain code instead.
<br />
<br />I'm not saying it is impossible to make complex things with just 2KB of RAM, but you do need to make some sacrifices, as well as some gymnastics (lots of bankswitching) in order to achieve something easily done with WRAM.

<br />
<br />And yes, people like me would hurl of horror if they see a game that uses a great mapper like MMC5 and wastes it's power to produce something very simple.
<br />
<br />And tepples is right, emulators doesn't require custom-made mappers unless you write a plugin for them and this reduce portability. Also I doubt it's easier to produce your own PCB with custom logic (and it's likely you can't get it to work like excepted on the first try) than chaning a MMC5 cart into a devcart.
<br />You could always make customs cart if you really need to sell tousands of copies of a great game, that isn't likely to happen in near future.

If you just want a high performance game and think MMC5 will be most capable hardware for the job, that's probably a misconception. Personally I feel you should try to get by with as little as possible, and if your game progresses to a point where the default NES/mapper model (bankswitching, IRQ) isn't sufficient, you might as well blow away the MMC5 with a custom design like dual-port tile-granule bankswitched writable CHR ROM, etc etc.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">tepples wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">Pros: More emulators support MMC5 than a homemade mapper. This is important because most people will be playing your game's demo version in an emulator on a PC running Windows.</div>
<br />You'd really only need one emulator to run your demo, and this could possibly be the same emulator used during the development phase. Assuming the author could implement the mapper for the PowerPak, that would also be another distribution channel, which wouldn't be accessible with MMC5 (or MMC3 really) since it's still not fully supported.

<br />
<br />And yes, like you were saying Tokumaru, it's true that SRAM is essential in boosting the complexity of a game. I see pages 0-7 as good for holding variables and small arrays. Excluding the stack. But for copies of large things like levels and screens, the extra RAM is essential.

<br />
<br />I agree with kyuusaku though that it's best to use only what you need. Don't waste features. Designing your own mapper for your game would be the way to go if you can do that. Although I wish someone would make their own MMC3 or better class of mapper for homebrewers and people building reproductions could have mapper hacks to it. It bothers me that the MMC3 lacks eight 1kb CHR banks. It shouldn't be a very tall order for someone to make a mapper that has eight 1kb chr, four 8kb PRG, a CPU and/or A12 based IRQ counter, and WRAM/SRAM support.

<br />
<br />I know what you mean. I'm still in the experimental &amp; learning phase so I'm not sure yet how many features I will use from those possible mappers. Since I do have access to many junk cart I'm just trying to check which one I should salvage since it could be useful later.  
<br />
<br />I don't have the engineering background to be able to built my own mapper (I would love to be able to do it thought). So for now I will continue to hunt for some MM5 + ff3j junk cart, if I can find any.

<br />Bregalad, I have nothing against you or your game. Stop interpreting everything I say as an attack towards you.
<br />
<br />If you compare them directly, your project is simpler than mine or Celius'. Yours uses a first generation board, ours use an advanced mapper. You use almost no WRAM, we use every byte. You have no scrolling, we do, 8-way. They are very different projects, but it's not like we feel your game is inferior or anything. Hell, it's simplicity even makes it more interesting! I just love to see things that were well done in spite of the scarce resources. Also, you get to finish yours first, and that should be very rewarding. You said it yourself you'd go with a simpler project in order to gain more experience.
<br />
<br />I never said you game is bad, looks bad, or is ridiculously simple. But it is not exactly ambitious either. Not that there is anything wrong with that, it was your choice, you said it. So please, stop defending yourself every time I say things that are barely related to your project. I have a lot of faith in your game because I know you are an exceptional programmer. I really want to play it, even though it's not my favorite style.

<br />That mapper list is not accurate, I verify games by just loading them in an emulator. There's also the NES cart database.
<br />
<br />You can spot a MMC5 by it's oversized Nintendo made case with "FAMICOM" written on it. Konami's games have a black case, where IIRC all the others are white (like Just Breed).

<br />Ok, good to know. Some other carts did use big cases (for example Madara VRC6) but I don't remember if the word Famicom was written on it (I don't think it's the case).  I will check my cart later and update this mail with the result then.
