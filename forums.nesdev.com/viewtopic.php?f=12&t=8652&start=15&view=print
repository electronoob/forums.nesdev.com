<br />Yeah. And there it's getting complicated... according to Nintendo, the GSU seems to be scratching the limits (though unclear if they refer to GSU1 or GSU2), but measuring the power consumption may return "incorrect" values (unless one ensures that GSU is always running; ie. consumption shold drop when it is stopped).
<br />Hmmm, Nintendo didn't release any specs an max cartridge power consumption?

<br />Ah, so the reads may trigger in the "middle" of a CPU cycle? And the exact location may vary from chip to chip? Makes sense. No, don't have further info on that, I never got so far into low level timings.
<br />
<br />One thing I haven't seen mentioned in the internet is the "double" IRQ at H=339, V=0 (in fact, I haven't yet added it to my own doc). The CPU's vcount wraps to 0 one dot in advance, so you get two HV-IRQs for H=339,V=0 (one at end of line 261, one at end of line 0). And accordingly, no HV-IRQ for H=339,V=261. Haven't checked if any emus are reproducing that effect (mine isn't doing so yet).

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />&gt; Ah, so the reads may trigger in the "middle" of a CPU cycle?
<br />
<br />Based on my observations, I believe that to be the case, but I cannot prove it from software. All I can provably say is $4201 write latches counters 4 clock ticks later than $2137 reads. Tepples mentions it is the case for the NES as well, which is also how I do things with my NES core.
<br />
<br />&gt; One thing I haven't seen mentioned in the internet is the "double" IRQ at H=339, V=0
<br />
<br />I have not heard of that one. I wonder if that happens with both CPU revisions (it should.) Pretty sure I have IRQs set to trigger at that time. Very, very weird.
<br />
<br />&gt; And accordingly, no HV-IRQ for H=339,V=261.
<br />
<br />This I do simulate. With the exception of your double-IRQ note, it all makes sense when you think about the PPU feeding the CPU only V/Hblank signals, and consider them at a slight delay behind the PPU.
<br />
<br />If you want something really crazy that even I don't emulate yet ... the very first video frame when you first power on the system triggers IRQs one scanline early.
<br />
<br />Eg power on, set IRQ to trigger at V=22, and it triggers at V=21 instead.
<br />
<br />&gt; Great, that'll be interesting! At first glance, it seems to be actually Z80 code (or if my guess was correct, HD64180 code; ie. extended Z80).
<br />
<br />Wonderful. At least I have a GBZ80 core already, so I won't have to go from nothing like with ARMv3.

<br />
<br />Something that does not seem to be documented about the Super Famicom Box is the keyed selector switch on the front of the console. There are more positions than just OFF and ON. In fact, I never could make sense of why OFF was the normal play mode, and ON basically blocked the screen out with some text and stopped the system.
<br />EDIT: It acts different with a dead battery.
<br />
<br />hmm. this also popped up on youtube:
<br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U3oQZT7vXrw">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U3oQZT7vXrw</a><!-- m -->
<br />
<br />The biggest use for this switch is to show screens to get a total count for how many times each game has been played.
<br />
<br />The switch itself is kind of wasteful in that it connects the common wire C to either 0 1 2 3 4 or 9 (does not use binary). The text overlay even complains (in japanese) if the C wire is not connected to ANY of those options after powerup. The overlay also complains if there is no controller activity for a few minutes (I never measured how long). I'm guessing the point of the message is to tell a new person to reset if they walk in on a game ending or are generally just confused.
<br />
<br />I'm not trying to sway things one way or another, but that screw-on rectangular panel on the right side of the box has literally nothing magical behind it. There also doesn't seem to be any room to do anything with it because the monstrous game cartridges sit right behind it, along with a pretty substantial metal brace to keep the unit from being crushed by whatever TV somebody would drop on top of it.
<br />
<br />I don't have drivers for those one-of-a-kind hexagonal bits Nintendo uses, so my abililty to take this apart is severely limited.

<br />If I got it right... there are 10 possible positions (?), with 6 used positions (and the other positions causing an error message). And non-binary means that position "3" would be 10 "bits" (0000001000), rather than 4bit binary (0011), right?

<br />
<br />Will provide pictures.
<br />CPU is indeed HD64180 (package reads HD64180RF6X)
<br />Optional coin mech connects on right side (see <a href="http://dforce3000.de/index.php?p=fdsingle&amp;uid=228" class="postlink">http://dforce3000.de/index.php?p=fdsingle&amp;uid=228</a>), your guess concerning unused interal connectors is probably correct (don't have one of these, either).

<br />
<br />Yeah, mostly. The sequence goes 9-0-1-2-3-4
<br />On a normally functioning unit, you are mechanically limited to those positions (it does not go counter-clockwise past 9 to 8 or clockwise past 4 to 5). 360 degrees / 10 = 36 degrees per click. There are 7 wires going to the selector switch, with PCB labels 0 1 2 3 4 C 9
<br />
<br />You are understanding correctly that there is only supposed to be one bit set at a time, i.e. C connects to 0.
<br />
<br />There is one position counter-clockwise from "OFF" or 0, that corresponds with 9. When turning clockwise from 0 it only clicks up to position 4. If you completely disconnect the switch it powers up like it was in position 0 and complains about it with onscreen text.
<br />
<br />d4s, many thanks for posting the coin counter. I was fearing some people were assuming that you dropped coins directly into the area covered up by the plate.
<br />
<br />
<br />Dead battery, mode switch positions:
<br />Apparently the system acts different with a functional coin cell battery. This is odd, but I think the service menu might have a way of changing how the system acts.
<br />
<br />9 - Service Mode (Install mode)
<br />
<br />0 - Play any game, no restrictions. There is no option 5 after selecting the game.
<br />
<br />1 - Giant Japanese yellow text on blue background saying the equivalent of THE KEY IS ON, please turn the key OFF. (kii ga ON ni natte imasu. kii o OFF ni shite kudasai). It looks like the Super Famicom is generating this text.
<br />
<br />2 - After selecting a game, you can now pick option 5 to Try a game (for free) for 2 minutes. Onscreen text counts down time. Warns one minute left, then when almost out of time counts down the seconds. Resets back to the menu. You can still pick option 1 and play freely, but onscreen text does not go away.
<br />
<br />3 - Self Check. White text on a blue screen like 1.Controller....Ok, 8.RTC.....OK. Just continues to loop.
<br />
<br />4 - Power OFF, Scared me the first time because a relay clicks. If the unit has the optional power outlet (mine does not), I think this is intended to shut off the television set.

<br />
<br />This BS-X doc from d4s, <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://dforce3000.de/pub/d4s_satellaview_modem_regs.txt">http://dforce3000.de/pub/d4s_satellaview_modem_regs.txt</a><!-- m --> has some info on reading Satellaview I/O ports on real hardware. Great info, and now I am having a bunch of questions:
<br />
<br />&gt; reg  (r/w): def description
<br />"def" means initial value on Power-Up (and/or on Reset)?
<br />
<br />&gt; 2188 (r/w): ... 14 bits wide ... reading back $aa,$55.
<br />How can it read-back 55AAh if it's only 14bit wide? Which bits are used/unused? And what are the unused bits, open-bus, or always 0, always 1?
<br />
<br />&gt; 2194 (r/w): $00 (4bit) 
<br />&gt; bit0 affects bit0 of 2196
<br />&gt; bit2 switches satellaview access light on
<br />&gt; 2196 (r)  : $02 bit0 alternates fast if bit 1 of 2194 is set
<br />Okay, with 4bit you mean bit0-3? (existing software uses only that bits), so bit4-7 are always zero, not read/write-able?
<br />Ehhhhm, which bit affects 2196.bit0? "bit0" of 2194 or "bit 1" of 2194?
<br />LED is ON or OFF when setting 2194.bit2?
<br />Software always writes same value to bit2+bit3 of 2196, so my guess was that both are LED related (like givining it more power when both bits set, or switching it from Red to Green on certain values or so). But now, after reading your doc, the Access-LED is solely controlled by bit2? And, just to be sure, the Power-LED isn't software controlled?
<br />
<br />&gt; 2195 (r)  : $00
<br />That one isn't used by existing software. On hardware it's just always reading zero?

<br />Most of the info on the page is great, but especially the decapping part didn't convince me: As far as I understood, he basically looked at the 16L8 number in the decapped chip (?) and the conclusion that a 16L8 without "built-in" storage cannot be programmed to store data seemed wrong to me.
<br />I am not familar with PALs, but I think the NOR-gate-flipflop idea should work (see above Talk page). Don't know if it's possible to program that PAL so that the flipflop acts like a "hidden" internal variable. Otherwise, one could program it so that the flipflop state shows up on one of the output pins (and from there it could be fed back into the chip).
