		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />My TV interlaces when it displays a regular cable tv signal, and it interlaces on the "INPUT" screen, but when it's displaying the signal from the NES, it stops interlacing.
<br />
<br />I wanted to know why this happens, so I turned to our good friend Google, and it said that a standard 480i NTSC signal is 525 scanlines per frame, with each frame being made up of 2 262.5 scanline "fields" which alternate between the odd and even scanlines of the full resolution 480-scanline picture. I knew this already, but it didn't mention how a composite NTSC signal can be non-interlaced 240p @ ~60hz, instead of the regular 480i @ ~30hz.
<br />
<br />I dug a little more info up, and ntsc-tv.com says that the vertical sync signal is as follows:
<br />For odd fields:
<br />6 pulses of hblank at double rate
<br />6 pulses of vblank at double rate (vblank being hblank with an inversed duty cycle)
<br />6 pulses of hblank at double rate
<br />This equates to 9 scanlines of sync signals, then what I'm <strong>guessing</strong> to be 11 regular "active" scanlines (including a normal hsync signal and colorburst) of just black, and then 242.5 active scanlines of visible data.
<br />
<br />Note that the odd field ends <strong>halfway through</strong> its last scanline.
<br />
<br />The even field begins with the same 6-6-6 sequence of sync pulses, but they start in the middle of a scanline, so the sequence is offset by half of a scanline (which is why the pulses are at double rate; each scanline is <em>guaranteed</em> to begin with an hsync pulse that way). Since the even field's vsync signal ends in the middle of a scanline, the black level is output to fill the remainder of the scanline. Then, 10 blank scanlines follow, followed by a scanline whose first half is blank and whose second half is visible data, followed by 242 visible scanlines.
<br />
<br />The important information is that odd fields have their vertical retrace command aligned with the scanlines, and the even fields have their vertical retrace command <em>half a scanline early</em>.
<br />
<br />To detect the vertical retrace command, ancient TVs use a simple lowpass filter. For the 6-6-6 sequence, the first 6 pulses will average out to "slightly lower than black", the second 6 pulses to "vertical retrace", and the last 6 pulses to almost black again.
<br />
<br />Remember, on even fields, this sequence occurs half a scanline earlier than on odd fields, so the TV detects the vertical retrace command half a scanline earlier than it would on an odd field.
<br />
<br />This is what causes interlacing, on even fields, the vertical retrace occurs half a scanline earlier, which offsets the scanning by half a scanline's width. Because of this constant alternation between scanline-aligned and half-scanline offset vblanks, each field's scanlines will be drawn in between the scanlines of the previous field.
<br />
<br />Knowing this, the way to have a non-interlaced signal, you just make sure vblank occurs at the same time for each field, rather than alternating. This seems to be referred to as 526 or 524-line NTSC, which kinda hints on how this is accomplished.
<br />
<br />Pretend like you're always drawing an odd field, and either remove the half-active scanline at the end of the field (524-line), or add an extra hblank double-rate pulse at the end of the field (526-line).
<br />
<br />On another note, this also explains why most LCD TVs make the NES graphics look like ass: They're trying to deinterlace a progressive signal.

<br />Ah! This explains why a scan doubler makes my NES look so much better on my LCD screen.

<br />
<br />So can this info help anyone make a scan converter for computer graphics?
<br />Everyone wants to convert game graphics from let's say an emulator running on a PC or laptop, to a TV at true 240p low resolution!
<br />Just the thought that it's almost impossible to do this baffles me extremely.
<br />
<br />There are some scan converters that do this, but they are way too expensive or hard to find and weren't meant for the gaming community anyway.
<br />
<br />Can't anyone make something like this?
<br />

<br />
<br />1. Any PC (or laptop) to small Converter via VGA.
<br />2. Small Converter to TV via S-video.
<br />3. <strong>A switch to convert the Interlaced image to a Non-interlaced image. (240p at 60hz)</strong>
<br />
<br />Why the hell not??
<br />
<br />I would pay anything to anyone who is willing to make me one like this.
<br />

<br />
<br />Oh, and it better have ZERO (0) lag.

<br />
<br />Really?? I don't own a Wii... how well do the emulators for wii work?
<br />What systems are emulated?
<br />I am skeptical about finding a console that can emulate games better than a PC............................. and besides i want to run not just emus, but low res PC games as well, with the converter, all would be possible.

<br />
<br />Unfortunately, the late 90's JVC TV I currently use for the Wii has a bad picture.  When it's in interlaced mode, you can really see the interlacing, and it's annoying.  When it's in 240p  mode, you can see black scanlines on every other row.  It looks sort of like an emulator with "TV mode" turned on, but for real.  But at least the illuminated scanlines are bright enough to counteract the black scanlines.  But this has nothing at all to do with the Wii itself, it's just a bad TV.
<br />
<br />You can use SNES controller adapters that convert a SNES pad into a Gamecube controller.  (Make sure you don't get the "newer" version of the Wii that drops Gamecube compatiblity)  Retrousb.com sells the adapters.
<br />
<br />There's also DOSBox available on the Wii, but I've never tested it out.  Supposedly, it's too slow for games like Doom or Warcraft 1, but at least it supports USB keyboards and mice.
<br />
<br />The NES emulator is FCEU, and it works as well as FCEU has ever worked.  The SNES emulator is Snes9x.  The Genesis Emulator works well too, but you need to make sure you redefine keys so you can get back to the main menu when using a SNES pad.
<br />
<br />In order to modify the Wii to run homebrew software, you need a copy of Super Smash Bros. Brawl, or Lego Indiana Jones/Return of the Jedi/Batman, and an SD card.
