<br />
<br />Gee I wonder how many more games you'll want to reproduce so that you can play them "on your TV", when you could just buy the PowerPak and never have to reproduce any of them.
<br />
<br />Seems like doing the way you're doing it will eventually run into a bunch of money -- unless...

<br />
<br />As blarg says, the next one that was asking a similar thing was doomed. However, chances are that this will continue to happen again and again. What should I do then ? Ignore the post... I guess it's the best option.
<br />
<br />I can't stress it enough that it's a BAD idea to help people to make fake cartridges, as this serves no purpose (if they can't buy the original they can play on emus or on the powerpak, illegaly for sure but without annoying anyone nor making this forum filled with illegal stuff), and people <em>could</em> illegally sell them for a lot of profit (not that <em>all</em> of them will, but at least a couple of people already did that)

<br />If I am reading through some typo's. I'd assume it's are you making a patch, but I just want to say NTSC games will work on PAL TV's, sometimes not the other way around, though.

<br />Unless the games use hardcoded timed code, in which case they need to be converted.
<br />
<br />Anyway, I think lilou was trying to confront Bregalad, saying that since he made a PAL patch that meant he also wanted to put the game on a cartridge, so why can he do it but not others?
<br />
<br />I don't even know if Bregalad did make this patch, but he could just argue that he did it so that people living in PAL regions could play the game without glitches on a PowerPak for example, not necessarily make carts.
<br />
<br />I think that this crappy discussion is going nowhere.

<br />Almost nothing in the Hardware and Flash Equipment section is NES dev related. There is like one topic on the first page of this section that has anything remotely to do with develeping for the NES. The biggest topic in this section is about what games do and don't work well with the powerpak. What does that have to do with NES dev? Nothing. If you are going to gripe so much about the "fake" cartridge questions then you should be all over any powerpak topic that doesn't have to do with a homebrew game.
<br />
<br />This website (which is a great resource of all things NES) has not only info actually developing NES programs, but tons of other stuff like harware info. Much of that info has nothing to do with NES dev. The forum section title itself should let you know that there is going to be minimal NES development talk in here, so it really shouldn't bother you so much.  This website is the best resource on the internet for information about putting a game on real cartridge, so I think it is extremely fitting that these types of questions are posted here. Also, there have only been 25 threads that have been created or had any activity this entire month, so it isn't like these threads are taking away anything from any other threads.
<br />
<br />As for the whole "fake" cartridge thing... I find your point of view on it to be a bit silly. "Fake" implies that you are trying trick someone into thinking it is the real thing. The vast majority of the these questions have to do with games that never really even existed. Most of the games are prototypes or translations. The people that actually want these games know exactly what they are getting. Aside from a couple of examples people faking Stadium Events everybody I have seen making and selling repro NES games have been on the up and up. I can understand not helping someone repro a game that actually exists, but the repros that we are talking about here are totally harmless. There is absolutely nothing worse about playing one of these games on a repro cart than playing it on a powerpak. A lot of people want an actual cartridge with a pretty label to play with. Some people collect games and want a real copy for their collection. These "fake" games are not as evil as you seem to think.

The vast majority of discussion on the subject of hardware has nothing to do with development.
<br />
<br />All I am saying is that there is no harm in discussing repros in this section. It is appropriate as this site is the main source for info regarding the subject at hand. Even if it were off topic it wouldn't be much of a problem considering the small amount of activity that this forum section has in the first place.

<br />It seems you are taking a sarcastic tone to oppose me. Of course it is related to NES development to know what mappers are correctly emulated on the power pak. The inner working of mappper is also realated to nes development.
<br />just an example, I won't commant your whole furious posts because I don't feel like it.
