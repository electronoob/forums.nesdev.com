		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Regarding this website: <br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://tasvideos.org/EmulatorResources/NESAccuracyTests.html">http://tasvideos.org/EmulatorResources/ ... Tests.html</a><!-- m --><br /><br />I was looking through some of the notes at the bottom of the page and found these 3 little tidbits:<br /><br />apu_reset/4017_timing: fail &quot;Frame IRQ flag should be set sooner after power/reset. Failed #3&quot;<br /><br />apu_reset/4017_written: &quot;At power, $4017 should be written with $00. Failed #2&quot;<br /><br />apu_reset/len_ctrs_enabled: &quot;At reset, length counters should be enabled, triangle unaffected. Failed #3&quot;<br /><br />Regarding these 3 errors: I thought that $4017 was written with $00 on start-up or am i missing something here. (or maybe i am confusing this with something else) I'm currently tracing through the NstApu.cpp source and do not see the code regarding the $00 at power up for $4017. The other 2 i am not so sure about so maybe someone can help shed some light or if its simple enough maybe help me come up with a patch. <br /><br />Now i know nestopia undead has a ticketing system for issues but i would like to try to use this as a learning experience. I also have seen where a lot of issues with nestopia stuff were popping up on here so i am certainly not using this as a place to post issues as well, but i find all the issues with nestopia's apu interesting since its among the &quot;more accurate&quot; emulators still out there.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Old post, may be relevant for #1, which indicates that CPU cycle counts were incorrect for some opcodes in the emulator: <!-- l --><a class="postlink-local" href="http://forums.nesdev.com/viewtopic.php?p=91613#p91613">viewtopic.php?p=91613#p91613</a><!-- l --><br /><br />As for the 2nd issue (&quot;At power, $4017 should be written with $00. Failed #2&quot;), I would suggest that right before starting ROM code (i.e. before running any code at the RESET vector), see what $4017 &quot;should&quot; contain by looking at the code for that register and ensuring the default value is $00.  I don't have my Windows development VM set up otherwise I'd step through and look myself.<br /><br />According to <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://wiki.nesdev.com/w/index.php/CPU_power_up_state">http://wiki.nesdev.com/w/index.php/CPU_power_up_state</a><!-- m --> $4017 should be $00 on power-on, but upon reset may be whatever the last value in the register was (i.e. pre-setting of $00 only applies to power-on).

	<tr>
		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Random thoughts (no evidence this is in the code at all):<br /><br />i) Memory allocations for blocks of memory relating to the $4xxx range (e.g. malloc() + memset()), depending on if code uses values from post-malloc as defaults (I do not know)<br /><br />ii) What the actual $4017 register is assigned to variable-name-wise and work things back from there.  This could be easy, it could be complex (e.g. variable may be part of a struct, and that struct may be pre-allocated and pre-zeroed by a malloc() during emulator launch but not zeroed during power-on every time).<br /><br />Like with any emulator, the code base is going to be massive, and I wouldn't be surprised if the answer lied within some other file than Apu.cpp.  No software I know of, including OO (despite socially proliferated as operating this way), is &quot;fully independent&quot; with all of its things.  You really do have to know how something works/behaves &quot;all the way down&quot;.
