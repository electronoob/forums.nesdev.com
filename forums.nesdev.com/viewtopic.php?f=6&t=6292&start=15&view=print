<br />
<br />Also, I like a lot of old folk and bluegrass such a  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMJz-puzniU" class="postlink">The Stanley Brothers</a>, and a lot of garage, like Teengenerate, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFa462PofmA" class="postlink">Reigning Sound</a> and such.

<br />
<br />Metroid, because it was creepy at time - it sticks to this day. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_eek.gif" alt=":shock:" title="Shocked" /> Not too long ago I played through most of Metroid II, unfazed until I reached the very end, where I supposed composer Ryoji Yoshitomi finds inspiration from Hip Tanaka's music.
<br />
<br />And Journey to Silius - just because it's Journey to Silius - it's '80s digitalized rock.
<br />
<br />I still like '80s rock music!
<br />
<br />And is it just me or does Ninja Gaiden's music seem inspired from the classic Romeo &amp; Juliet film?

<br />
<br />Maybe some of you guys are familiar with <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=udTyjGJaFvU" class="postlink">YMO</a>?  I've really been enjoying their stuff.
<br />Cool to have <a href="http://www.playlist.com/searchbeta/tracks#tron%20anthem/all/1" class="postlink">Wendy Carlos</a> mentioned too, that's some amazing stuff, going back to when synthesizers were monstrous monophonic machines.  I had kept most of Switched on Bach on my mp3 player pretty much permanently.
<br />
<br />I have to mention <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKhfkfnbAMQ" class="postlink">Dream Theater</a> as well, I have to admit I'm not familliar with much of their stuff, but IMO Pull Me Under is one of the most epic metal songs of all time.  I used to rock out to this song all over the place when I was driving deliveries at my previous job (<a href="http://www.sellyoursemi.com/Standard_Ads/images/72995366.jpg" class="postlink">2001 Isuzu NPR</a> had an awesome sound system if you take care with the stereo's DSP settings).
<br />
<br />Also I like the sound of big band music, stuff like <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9C0E2n2XAw" class="postlink">Police Squad/Naked Gun theme</a> is great.  I wish I had my grandpa's old reel-to-reel tapes and albums, probably some great stuff in there that was harder for me to appreciate when I was 5 years old or whatever.
<br />
<br />Can't forget <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBupII3LH_Q" class="postlink">Henry Mancini</a> as well!  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dechpnavTyA" class="postlink">this too</a>

<br />Heh, classy. Love how the last one gets all funky when the solo starts, although that's probably not in the original song.

<br />
<br />Yeah, they call that "Visual rock" in Japan.  
<br />
<br />I'm surprised I didn't post anything earlier in this thread.  I like all kind of music. I can go from classical to metal as long as I like what I hear so usually I don't stick to one style only. I could be listening to some game music then switch to Slipknot, go back to some techno and end up on some japanese pop etc. 
<br />
<br />But I could say that I tend to like music with guitar since I was playing some in the past (don't have time these days, it's kind of rotting in it's case.. a shame).
<br />
<br />Since there was many video with Japanese band, I will had my share of it. 
<br />
<br />Mucc was not mentioned yet. here's <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QqIOyVee6iU" class="postlink">Mucc - Boku to kimi e</a>.  It may be too fuzzy for Bregalad taste. It goes from softer distotion to harder darker sound (from my vision), guitar and vocal too. I like the change from one to the other. 
<br />
<br />I found that group with <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdjs5Cc8sF0" class="postlink">this song</a>. They don't seem to have a video out of it.  Maybe it was a cover song or something, don't remember. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy8zeYVq7dY" class="postlink">The live version</a> contains subtitles by fan but the sound is less clear but the live vocal is good actually. The singer is not fake! laugh!  This song for sure will not be ones of Bregalad favorite because it's too metal <img src="./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" />

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />When I was a little guy the first time I remember my scool mates playing tetris on their gameboy with chiptune port of Tcheakovsky music on it and I said it sucked. I was far to imagine I would become a fan of 8-bit music half-a dozen years later.
<br />Anyway the first time I was impressed by a video game song it was this one : <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rViYSp88r3g&amp;feature=related&amp;fmt=18" class="postlink">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rViYSp88r3g&amp;feature=related&amp;fmt=18</a>
<br />My sister was a fan of that titanic game and I was surprised how much scary just a piano could be, I had never hear that in any other type of music. Of course now I think this song sucks and I know video games with WAY better music, but I have to remember it as the first that "impressed" me and that made me figure out that video game actually had music in them.
<br />
<br />Then I don't remember exactly, but I guess I was impressed by the music in "Myst" and "Command &amp; Conquer" PC games, which made me want to compose video game music. But it's only when we god a Playstation with FF7 that I was really stunned by how good the music in the game way, and that really made me want to make my own games and game music.
