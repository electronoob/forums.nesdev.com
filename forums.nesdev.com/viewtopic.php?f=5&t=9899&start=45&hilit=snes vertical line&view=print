I have spoken to the maker about it and there is a lot of room for improvement, especially when all the data is converted to something more usable on the 68K.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />To each their own, but I personally think Star Fox has terrible graphics (for <span class="posthilit">SNES</span> standard) and aged very badly.<br />Back then everyone was like &quot;OMFG it's 3D on the Super NES !!&quot; but now it looks like total crap, as everything is drawn with something like 10 single colour polygon, which looks terrible. On the other hand games with advanced 2D graphics aged very well and are still as enjoyable as they were on their release date.<br /><br />Also the Super NES could probably do this without the FX chip as well, the frame rate would just be lower.

And then there's also all the tons of Sonic Fan Games and Rom Hacks that Sega doesn't care about. <br /><br />I honestly don't think Nintendo would really care if someone ported Starfox to a 25 year old obsolete system. They didn't seem to care about the Super Mario Bros port.

Would be interesting to see a demo with implementation of this tech, though.
