It isn't any real offense, but having long pseudos with all letters in caps is pretty anoying because it makes the post arrays forced to be larger, and this makes all your posts anoying regardless of the content.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I'd have to agree with Bregalad, it is a little annoying the way your name takes so much space and disturbs stuff around it. If you'd consider changing it a bit, we'd be grateful.
<br />
<br />About the sources you asked... well... your request is a little too generic. Nobody codes an ADC program that shows results on the screen. And people don't usually have small pieces of simplistic code. Most people here COULD come up with a simple program in a few minutes and post it here, but what's the point? Nobody will code anything without a point. If you have a specific request on how something can be done on the NES, ask directly and we'll help you with whatever you need, but we can't just start coding random stuff for nothing, you know?
<br />
<br />On the main nesdev page there are a lot of programs and demos from many people and many of them have the sources included. Maybe you should take a look at that.

(and i have read yoshi doc etc)... it will be very apreciated if you can post a code that show result of one adc on screen.

<br />There is kind of "Hello World" programms arround, but you can not be satisfacted enough with them. The best solution is probably to try to code random stuff and see results, and learn by yourself. Yes, you have to first learn how pattern tables and nametatles works. However, it isn't very complicated. Just edit tiles of your pattern table with tile layer or anyother tile editor, and name tables aren't anything but large index of tiles for each row and each column of the NES screen.
<br />Nesticle helps a lot if you're a begginer. I know it is a very bad emulator in therm of accuracy, but it's tile wiever, palette viewer, etc  cannot be rivalised by anyother emulator. FCE Ultra's debbuger may help a lot, because you can watch each step of your code.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I undestand what you're saying... when I satrted programming (not for NES, in general I mean) I learned by changing other people's codes and watching the results.
<br />
<br />The problem with writing stuff on the NES is that it is not possible to demonstrate it only with code. The NES has no font built-in, like most computers do. So, the first thing you have to do, is draw your own font to a CHR file, or copy one from a game. I'd suggest you use a tile editor like Tile Layer for that task.
<br />
<br />After you have your font (or numbers, or whatever you want to show on screen), then you write the code that will do the math and use the characters you drew for the output of the result.
<br />
<br />Do you already know how to use any assembler? Maybe NESASM, as all beginners seem to use it... if you know the basics of using the assembler, I'll gladly help you with some simple code. However, if you do not know how to use an assembler, I can not get you started on this. I don't know how to use NESASM or any other popular assembler. My methods are too weird to teach a beginner and will just confuse your head.
<br />
<br />When you can handle the assembler, making a header for your ROM, and these kind of tasks that have nothing to do with programming and logic, I can help you with programming and logic. Maybe someone can guide you through the other stuff.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />If you know that, great. Can you make a CHR file with the letters and numbers and place it at the end of the ROM? If you can do that the code to do what you want can be simple. Except for the fact that you'll have to convert the numbers to base 10, wich is not such a trivial task. If you feel like leaving the result in hexadecimal, then it's easy.
<br />
<br />I'd say the steps for what you want to do are:
<br />1. disable rendering;
<br />2. wait 2 vblanks;
<br />4. do the addition;
<br />5. convert the result to decimal; &lt;- this is optional!
<br />6. write the code of each digit of the result to one of the name tables;
<br />7. write something to a palette so you can see anything;
<br />8. wait for vblank;
<br />9. set the scroll to (0, 0) and enable rendering for the name table you wrote the result to;
<br />
<br />NOTE: it will probably run on a emulator if you do it like this, but on a real NES you don't know what's stored in RAM, and it's a good idea to clear the name tables and the attribute tables before writing your result.
<br />
<br />That's about it. Try to code something, and if you have trouble, just ask for help.
<br />
<br />One more thing: I bet this topic can be useful for you: <a href="http://www.nesdev.com/bbs/viewtopic.php?t=969" class="postlink">http://www.nesdev.com/bbs/viewtopic.php?t=969</a>
<br />It's from someone who just started and had success with simple sprite and background handling.
