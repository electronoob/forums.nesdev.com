I"ve made major progress on the ROM.<br /><br />This isn't one of those slop shoot semi change the graphics. This is going to be a total overhaul of SMB 2 to be like Doki doki panic where the good parts lie.<br /><br />Sou far I have changed:<br /><br />Grass to black. (Left it animated),<br /><br />Potion to lamp,<br /><br />Characters (Still need to work out a few things),<br /><br />The title on the intro screen to have the Doki doki panic kanji, and a few other things there,<br /><br />Shell turned to the proper mask,<br /><br />Mushrooms to masks,<br /><br />Health mushroom to a heart,<br /><br />Characters on the contributor screen (at the end) have their Japanese names now (Need to fix this again),<br /><br />Imajin's pic at the end fixed,<br /><br />character names at the end changed correctly to the Doki Doki panic names including Mamu.<br /><br />Changed the gate<br /><br />------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />Now my problems I'm having (I hope you guys can help.)<br /><br />One: Luigi's legs. They kick. Where in the hex do you turn that off, and what value do you insert to do sou?<br /><br />Two: Lina's head seems to have a white square above it. I think it's something to do with the way I did her sprite. I may have to redo it. But it's there except if I duck, or climb with her. I've looked at all the sprites and don't see the square there anywhere. It's directly above her head, and doesn't fill the 16x16 space completely. [I think it's a sprite leak,  like how they leak white into the eyes.]<br /><br /><br /><br />Three: How can I make the one up sound :<br /><br />0x005061 - Sound a 1-up makes<br />$8266-828D = 1UP sound<br />0x008276 ~ 0x00829D - Sound Effect data for 1-Up grab<br />(That's all my info on that part)<br /><br />Into the crystal grab music:<br /><br />0x009094 - Music Header for Crystal won<br /><br /><br />Four: If you look at the name table when you open the rom at: 21B0,,, I want to know where that character is stored in the rom (This is for the title screen).  It's not with the rest of the characters on the main screen. I want to use it to put credit, but, it's originally a blank space on the rom, and it's not with all the other characters. I've looked, and tried everything in the vacinity.<br /><br /><br />If anyone can help with any of this, I'd greatly appreciate it.<br /><br />I hate to bother you guys with this, but I seriously AM trying to make this rom good. <br />----------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />Also a little info:  <br /><br />If you run the rom, and then open the hex editor in the program, While it's running, 1e12 Changes the tempo.<br /><br />The original values on speeds are:<br /><br />6E = Dungeon<br />28= Outside<br />1B= Title<br /><br />Sou now I need to figure out what speed is right.<br /><br />Doki Doki speeds are:<br /><br />11 = Dungeon<br />09 = Outside<br />00 = Title<br /><br />Sou they don't correspond.<br /><br />The dungeon is located at: 907C in a hex editor. (Not in the in game hex editor)<br /><br />10EC in the NSF file.<br /><br />0E (I think) is a very close value to Doki Doki Panic's dungeon I think.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=4058">Kiokuffiib11@Yahoo.com</a> — Mon Jul 05, 2010 4:38 pm</p><hr />
