The hard part for me is understanding the platform specifics.<br /><br />I would love some examples or recommendations on what you use for timers.<br /><br />Say I wanted an object to go left for 2 seconds, halt, and then return to it's original location and start over.<br /><br />I know how to change animation frames based on the speed of the moving object.<br />I know how to change the meta-sprite's horizontal coordinates to match evenly.<br /><br />But what I can't understand is how to delay the speed.<br /><br />Most of my experience is MUD programming (text based chat games)<br />In the MUDs I worked on, there was a &quot;click&quot; mechanism.  An object could have a timer based on how<br />many clicks elapsed before performing a task or disposing itself or whatever you wanted.<br /><br />Is there some PPU register that you load a timer into? <br /><br />Thanks

You have to create a scripting language, which is basically a list of commands and arguments. For example, byte $50 could mean &quot;walk left&quot; and it would be followed by a frame count indicating how many times that command should be repeated.<br /><br />If you just want to simulate actions that could be performed with a joypad, you don't even need a scripting language, you can just make a list of pressed buttons (1 byte, since the controller has 8 button) and durations (each combination of buttons can last up to 256 frames). In <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/viewtopic.php?p=92120#p92120" class="postlink">this post</a> I shared my code for recording and playing back controller data, you need something like the playback code (there's some extra logic there to take the status of the real START button and mix it with the recorded data which was meant to exit demo mode, but you don't need anything like that).<br /><br />If you do need to do more than what raw controller data can represent, then you do need a scripting language with commands for everything the characters can do.

Once it reaches zero, run the code that changes the character's state.<br /><br />No, the PPU doesn't really do timer stuff (there is sprite 0 hit, but it's for within-frame timing). Really you do not want a hardware timer for this, using interrupts makes this kind of thing more complicated (have to be careful that you don't modify data that's being worked on currently, thread safety, etc.) and the availabilty of hardware timers on the NES is pretty sparing. The DPCM has an IRQ, and the frame sequencer has an IRQ but neither of them are really what you want here.<br /><br />It's much easier/safer just to count frames in your normal frame update loop.

The NMI is run once per frame right?<br />So, if I created the constant SECOND = $3C (dec 60), I could decrease it every NMI and<br />once it reached 0 it would start over.<br /><br />I was under the impression that the NMI only ran when a controller was used but that makes more sense.<br /><br />Thanks.

And there's a RAM set irective, and a zeropage reserve objective if you're using ASM6, so just read your assemblers README to now how to use it properly.

ROM-based programs though, which is always the case with the NES, do have to explicitly LOAD and STORE variables to RAM in order to initialize them.
