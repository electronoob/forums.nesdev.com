I don't think you need more than one layer of metatiles, and 32x32 is a very good size to use because it makes handling attributes much easier. You should also use some conventional compression such as RLE or LZ on each screen.<br /><br />This would work well even if you want to have basic scrolling like Zelda, where scrolling is just an animation from one screen to the other and the player has no power over it. All you have to do is decode the new screen to the name table that isn't visible, and when it's done scroll to show it. Of course that if you have hardwired mirroring, vertical for example, you'd have to copy the data a row at a time from the other name table into the visible one as it scrolls up or down. The Mega Man games with hardwired mirroring do this when scrolling vertically.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=95">tokumaru</a> — Fri Jul 24, 2009 8:38 am</p><hr />

What sort of matrix are we looking at, how many bits per entry?<br /></div><br />The easiest way to handle them is when the sizes of the metatiles are powers of 2, so that specific bits from a full coordinate can be used to identify all the metatiles. Take my metatile format as an example:<br /><br />If inside a 256x256 metatile (meaning I'm limiting values to 8 bits) I have coordinates %10010010 (x) and %00100110 (y). Ignore the lower 4 bits because those represent pixels inside the smallest metatile, so we have: %1001 and %0010. We're already inside a 256x256 metatile, which is composed by 4 128x128 metatiles. But in which of those 4 are those coordinates? Easy, the highest bit of the x coordinate will indicate if it's the left one or the right one. Similarly, the highest bit of the y coordinate will indicate if it's the top one or the bottom one. OK, my bits are %1 and %0 so we want the 128x128 metatile at the top right corner. Just go to the place where the 256x256 metatiles are stored and get that one.<br /><br />Now, inside the 128x128 metatile the process continues. The next bits are %0 and %0, so we want the 64x64 metatile at the top left corner. This goes on until the 16x16 metatile is reached, at which point you can do anything with it (draw it, collide with it, and so on).<br /><br />This is the process to find the smallest metatile at specific coordinates, but there are cases when we want to read more, such as when drawing a column or a row of metatiles while scrolling. The process is not much complicated. If rendering a column, for example, use the x coordinate of the column to select between the left or right sides of each type metatile, and once the smallest one is found, just read the top and bottom elements of all the metatiles all the way down until the column is complete.<br /><br />In the ROM each type of metatile is encoded individually. Each 256x256 metatiles points to 4 128x128 metatiles. Each of those point to 4 64x64 metatiles, and so on.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"><br />Why would you have a 256x256 metatile?<br /></div><br />You could ask the programmers of games like Sonic 1 or Mega Man X for their reasons, but the reason I use them is so that I can have huge levels that don't take so much memory.<br /><br />I don't expect to reuse many 256x256 metatiles, except for those that are pure sky or pure ground. Some sections of flat ground can be reused fairly often as well, and you can use tricks like placing decorative objects such as rocks and vegetation over the background so that it looks like a different area.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"><br />What am I looking at to determine the most optimal size for my largest metatile?<br /></div><br />The amount o redundancy you are willing to tolerate. Some games don't work well with large metatiles, such as RPGs, because their maps don't have many repeated areas. They have areas where specific blocks are reused a lot, so some RLE or LZ-based compression scheme might work better. Platforms in a platformer on the other hand are very similar, and you'll often see large blocks used over and over again.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=95">tokumaru</a> — Thu Jul 23, 2009 8:18 pm</p><hr />

<content type="html" xml:base="http://forums.nesdev.com/viewtopic.php?t=5429&amp;p=49140#p49140"><![CDATA[
Hi guys, I've been thinking about the reasoning behind different systems of organizing your backgrounds/level data and I'm looking for a simple method I can use for a platformer.  As such I have a lot of random questions so please forgive the length.<br /><br />I'm kind of going off of <a href="http://nesdev.com/bbs/viewtopic.php?t=5122" class="postlink">this topic</a> which has excellent info but I thought the subject was different enough to start a new one.<br /><br />The basic 2x2 metatiles have obvious memory-saving advantages.  There aren't many NES games that don't have 16x16 pixel blocks repeated all over the place.  It would be easy to stuff a lot of those together, RLE it and call it a day, though that wouldn't be efficient at all.  (Or <em>would</em> that be sufficient for a 4 to 8 level demo/game?)<br /><br />Anyway I'm having a hard time figuring out how I'd put larger metatiles to good use without sacrificing a lot graphically.  32x32 blocks would probably still have a lot of repetitions, but the larger you get the less I see the point.  Isn't the main point of metatiles to use repeatable data more than once?  How often am I going to repeat 64x64 or 128x128?  I understand reused screens the way Mario does it for each flagpole for example, but simply using big blocks while also trying to keep the level layout unique seems needlessly difficult for only mediocre savings.<br /><br />When people say they have metatiles of metatiles of metatiles, what do they mean?  I guess the first thing I picture is this:<br /><br /><img src="http://img528.imageshack.us/img528/7880/cv3.png" alt="Image" /> <img src="http://img233.imageshack.us/img233/7219/cv3wrong.png" alt="Image" /><br /><br />Which is clearly wrong and not the way most games appear to do it.  We need the flexibility to place graphics wherever we need them and in a typically complex screen there is no repeated data on the largest metatile size.  On closer inspection I see this:<br /><br /><img src="http://img528.imageshack.us/img528/9750/cv3liketiles.png" alt="Image" /><br /><br />But this introduces even more complexity.  Now we have 64x64 blocks mixing with 32x32 blocks, so we have to keep track of additional size/coordinate data rather than letting the sequential data be enough, much like an object based system.  Again, are the savings worth the effort?<br /><br />I understand that this example is probably flawed since CV3 is a complicated game made late in the NES's life, but it's representative of what I'm trying to understand: the memory savings vs. map decoding complexity.<br /><br />What about priority systems for background graphics - was it ever common to overlay metatiles on top of each other?  For example, writing in a metatile of a statue and overwriting the bottom of it with plant growth a few lines later.  The thought occured to me seeing the two small windows near Trevor with one mostly covered.<br /><br />I have seen from a lot of topics here that you don't usually store every tile of every screen; it makes sense for a level to have a default screen that is then modified.  You can seen this when you jump over the flagpole in Mario and you can keep walking forever.  Or like this screen of Kirby:<br /><br /><img src="http://img188.imageshack.us/img188/864/kirbysadventure0.png" alt="Image" /> repeats <img src="http://img188.imageshack.us/img188/3826/kirbystrip.png" alt="Image" /><br /><br />That doesn't seem too hard to implement.<br /><br />Do games use "vector" methods to store backgrounds?  For example in that Kirby screen, does the code detect the top of one of those thin poles and extrapolate it to the ground?  Or in this Mario screen,<br /><br /><img src="http://img528.imageshack.us/img528/5082/supermariobrothers31.png" alt="Image" /><br /><br />Is the slant defined by its height, and the top becomes the new "ground level" with a grass fill below it?<br /><br />Finally, would it be worthwhile to keep a copy of the current screen decoded into RAM on a 16x16 level?  (Meaning, with status bar taken into account, probably 192 bytes.)  It would essentially be for checking collisions or recording changes that need to be made during VBLANK.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3438">UncleSporky</a> — Thu Jul 23, 2009 4:09 pm</p><hr />
