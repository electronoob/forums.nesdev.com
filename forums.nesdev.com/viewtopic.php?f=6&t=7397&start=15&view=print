<br /><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qscFIoWUDGY" class="postlink">Final Fantasy V - Intension of the Earth</a> (from 0:24)
<br /><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UjFOTP47o2E" class="postlink">Final Fantasy IX - Kuja's Theme</a>
<br />
<br /><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2AaXlJPYLk" class="postlink">Final Fantasy IV - Wolrd Map</a>
<br /><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iiH0-J88QGE" class="postlink">Final Fantasy X - Riding Shoopuf</a>
<br />
<br />[url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqtGBR80NWw[/url]Final Fantasy VIII - The castle[/url] at 2:12
<br /><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=29P5lK5O-LM" class="postlink">Final Fantasy X - Brave Advancement</a>
<br />
<br />Of course those might have been intentional, but they're probably not.
<br />I think I have about half-a-dozen more in mind, all with Uemastu, so if you are interested just ask.
<br />
<br />EDIT : About the so-called similarity between Robo's theme and Never Gonna give you up, I disagree.
<br />
<br />I listened both songs very carefully, I really love both of them but I can say that they aren't similar. It's just a coincidence that playing both at the same time isn't too horrible (what happens if you play two random songs together).
<br />
<br />1) The melody is completely different
<br />2) The rythm of Never Gonna Give You up is a simple "kick, snare, kick, snare" rythm while the rythm of Robo's theme is more complicated
<br />3) The bassline of Robo's theme is a simple "daa--da-da-daa---da-da-daa....." pattern while the bassline of Never Gonna Give you Up is much more complex
<br />4) In the end only the chords match more or less, but even then, you notice they aren't completely matching, they don't always change at the same time.
<br />
<br />The reason the songs went well along is because the chord sequence is somewhat similar. Also they editied Robo's them when making it up, if you played the untouched original it would probably not work as well.
<br />
<br />So I disagree both songs are similar. Considering the incredible amount of songs ever composed by the humanity, there is a extremely high probability that a song will have the same chord sequence as another as another on a part of it, and then your list could last forever.

<br />Exactly my point. The moral of the project is that the case law for copyright in musical works is unworkable in the long term, and the only thing keeping the music industry from suing itself out of existence is a gentleman's agreement among the major labels to overlook minor similarities. An independent musician, on the other hand, can't claim the benefit of this agreement. Compare the Cold War-era state of mutual assured destruction, and see also <a href="http://www.spiderrobinson.com/melancholyelephants.html" class="postlink">a short story by Spider Robinson</a>.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />OK so to proof that Robo's theme is not similar with NGGYU, I took the time to analyse MIDIs from both songs and compare their sequences chords for the chorus (I didn't do it for the verses because they are obviously very different and don't blend together well at all).
<br />
<br />The chord sequence for NGGYU is :
<br />Gb7, Ab, Ab, Bbm
<br />Gb7, Ab, Ab, Bbm
<br />Gb7, Ab, Ab, Bbm
<br />Gb7, Ab, Ab, Bbm
<br />
<br />The chord sequence for Robo is :
<br />G, A, A, Bm7
<br />G, A, A, D
<br />G, A, A, Bm7
<br />G, A, A, B
<br />
<br />First constat is that NGGYU is a semitone lower, so they had to transpose either song to blend them together. Here for the example I'll transpose NGGYU one semitone higher, which gives :
<br />G7, A, A, Bm
<br />
<br />Which is similar to Robo's chord sequence for lines 1 and 3, just that the 7th is placed at the first chord instead at the last BUT you'll note that the last chord is different for lines 2 and 3.
<br />
<br />Also the melody is very different, there is no way you could call it similar. And please stop talking about lawyers and juges when there is no ROM download implied (it's not like if Rick Astley is going to sue Square).

<br />It's been suggested that the reason Earthbound isn't on Virtual Console and Mother 3 isn't released outside Japan has a lot to do with the Beatles.

<br />This might be possible, but I think the reason is that this game is highly securised and hard to emulate, and that Nintendo didn't find a way arround this (which is probably also why Battletoads, for example, isn't released for the VC).

<br />
<br />No offense but you're not telling me that Nintendo's emulator authors who work on this stuff ALL day can't emulate something a hobbyist can get working in hsi spare time? Hell they can hack the rom since they don't care about authenticity!

<br />
<br />As I already said the chords DOES match well for the most parts, but it's the ONLY thing that matches. The bassline is quite different, increase the bass of your amplifier if you can't hear it. Robo's bass is a simple rythm following the chords while NGGYU's bass is quite complex.
