		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I have been playing recently with sound fx and the famitracker sound driver.  There was a bug when playing a sound fx with sweep on a square channel, the music would not be restored properly.
<br />
<br />I found what seems to be some code for resetting the sweep register and the music was now playing normal.  I was happy until I found something else: after reseting the sweep channel, in some specific sounds (maybe low pitch ones), a clicking sound can be heard.  If I remove the code, the clicking sound is gone.
<br />
<br />This is the code I found in the driver to reset the sweep register:
<br />
<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">&nbsp; &nbsp;lda #$08<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;sta $4001<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;lda #$C0<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;sta $4017<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;lda #$40<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;sta $4017<br /></div>
<br />
<br />There is 2 possibilities that I can see:
<br />
<br />- The code is wrong
<br />- This is a maybe known side effect with sweep channels
<br />
<br />I really what to know the cause of this clicking sound. This is the only thing left to make the squares channels works properly (I hope so...).  I remember reading somewhere about a clicking sound but cannot find where I read that. I could be related but I can't find the message anymore.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Hmm... Either my question was so stupid or boring that nobody answered or I didn't explained it properly and a sample would be required.  
<br />
<br />The last version of the sound driver does have the issue if tested on square 1 . It seems to happens when the pitch goes low for the sound.  It only happens if there is more music that continue on that channel. With the song with no music on channel square 1, the bug doesn't happens.
<br />
<br />In the code above, I decided to only use the sweep register to reset and the sweep does reset. I tried with value $0 and it worked well. I don't know why 4017$ was used at all (I will need to test it on hardware once my dev kart is ready).  But between the transition from one sound to another, with some specific sounds, I can hear a clicking sound after the reset and for now I cannot figure out why it happens.  I cannot tell if it's a bug with sound emulation or it would happen in hardware too. Until I can test on the real thing, I cannot confirm.  But I guess sound emulation is quite advanced so I guess it would happen.
<br />
<br />I don't want someone to fix my code, this is my problem and I have fun doing it.  What I would like to know is if other people did have this problem before while playing square sound with sweep and why it did happen, how they resolved it.
<br />
<br />Thanks in advance for any comments, always appreciated.

<br />
<br />Strange isn't it.  Some people did read it thought.  Maybe something went wrong with the board software. this is the first time nobody answered one of my message so I was getting worried that my question was very stupid and that I posted it in the wrong forum <img src="./images/smilies/icon_lol.gif" alt=":lol:" title="Laughing" />

<br />
<br />It seems to be related to the update of the 4003$/4007$ registers with the previous data. Thanks Celius for pointing me in the right direction!

<br />
<br />Yeah, basically all you have to do is change $4003/$4007 when the value is going to be different. This usually happens when you change notes, but sometimes, like in one of my songs, there's an arpeggio where the pitch bends so that the value of $4003 would be different. This creates a bubbly noise, and it doesn't sound good.

<br />
<br />I read the wiki but since I'm still new to the APU, I still not 100% sure how it work. Now I understand the basics but still some subtle facts that I may miss like the one you mentioned about the side effects.
<br />
<br />After reading your thread, now I see that there was a reason why $4017 was used.  It's getting clearer. I will need to read the thread in more depth so I can understand better.
<br />
<br />Great, thanks everyone!  Now what is left is the noise channel bug <img src="./images/smilies/icon_confused.gif" alt=":?" title="Confused" />   Is there any side effect in this one to?  I checked the wiki right away and didn't saw one at first glance. It's like the previous noise affect the new one, like some counter that is not reset properly and the noise start at a different counter. hmmm..  I could start a new thread about it but I think this one is fine.
<br />
<br />Edit:
<br />
<br />I guess it must be related to the shift register.  I will try to understand how it work and it could fix my noise issue.
