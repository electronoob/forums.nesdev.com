I'm able to use ASM6 because SNGamer compiled s version that will work with Android assuming you have a command line tool to run it with on your device (which I do). Link to thread: <!-- l --><a class="postlink-local" href="http://forums.nesdev.com/viewtopic.php?p=132765">viewtopic.php?p=132765</a><!-- l --><br />*Also, I dont see how you could find sequencers painful <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /> Well, I mean, I guess it depends on the kind of sequencer, what features it has, and how it's laid out... Like, threre is obviously a world of a difference between tracker based programs such as ModPlugTracker or Cybertracker versus apps like Caustic or Reason.

It'll probably be a lot easier to develop on, although it's not really much of a power-house (older Atom CPU, built-in Intel graphics with (AFAIK) no 3D acceleration, etc.), but I imagine it'll make for a better development environment than a tablet.  :-)

And there's a text export tool, so if you know Python, Perl, C++, or any other language for doing text processing, you can massage your FTM into a format that any music engine can use.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />AC adapter arrived today, netbook is charging.  :D<br /><br />Edit: ...or not.  Looks like the battery won't hold charge according to the power LED indicator.  Sad panda.  So a replacement battery has been purchased (2x the capacity too, though it sticks out the back of the netbook a bit more due to the added cells but oh well -- more lifespan when in use!).<br /><br />Kind of amusing too: when it powers on, the first thing it complains about is the &quot;battery not being identifiable&quot; and forces you to press F1 (this never goes away).  Supposedly this is fixed in a BIOS update.  But the BIOS update won't work because the battery can't hold charge (DOS flash utility demands the battery have at least 10% charge, <strong>even if the AC charger is plugged in</strong>).  *shakes head*

Consider you have a big game, with hundreds of variables, and late into development you decide that a certain variable needs to be 16-bit instead of 8. What's easier, adding 1 to the addresses of the 100+ variables that follow it or simply changing the .dsb 1 to .dsb 2? You're completely free to move your variables around, adding or removing some, without bothering to rewrite all the addresses every time you do.<br /><br />If you really need the addresses for debugging purposes, you can generate a listing file when assembling, and that file will contain all the addresses in a way you can easily read.
