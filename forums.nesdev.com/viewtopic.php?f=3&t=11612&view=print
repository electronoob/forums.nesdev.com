You just init the sound system and then use sound-&gt;Start() and sound-&gt;CanWrite() wich returs how much the buffer is emptied.<br />There is a thing here: i can sync all the emu to sound, but the video gets scratched and at the other side if i force Direct3d9 to sync to VBlank i have sound problems.<br /><br />Any clue?

Assuming you're syncing to vblank, if your monitor's refresh rate is EXACTLY 60Hz, and your sound card is outputting at EXACTLY 44.1kHZ, then generating 735 samples per frame (or averaged over a couple of frames) would work.  In reality, this isn't the case.<br /><br />Let's say that your monitor's actual refresh rate is 59Hz. Now you're short 735 samples every second.  Conversely, let's say that the refresh rate is 61Hz. Now you're generating too many samples per second.  Your audio buffer will under/overflow eventually.  The same idea applies to any error in sound card output frequency.<br /><br />The way to work around this is to designate one of the clocks (refresh rate or audio frequency) as the master and adjust the other accordingly.  Since you can't modify video frame rate without causing visible artifacts (today at least. Maybe g-sync/adaptive-sync changes this), that means that you need to somehow adjust the audio playback rate. You can do that by changing the sound card playback frequency or by resampling the audio before sending it to the sound card. I use the latter technique in nemulator.

Now my emu constantly generates 735 samples for 60hz.<br /><br />But, the thing now is about getting the right VSync Hertz. We got D3D9::GetAdapterDisplayMode() that retrives the VSync, but they are, how to say it in english... &quot;round values&quot;... what about if we have for example 59.3hz. We have to use the DwmGetCompositionTimingInfo() API wich only works in Vista+, since its about desktop composition. We leave out XP!! <br /><br />Does somebody know GFXs working with not &quot;round&quot; values??

We got D3D9::GetAdapterDisplayMode() that retrives the VSync</div><br /><br />Querying for this value really doesn't help. The OS may report 60Hz but the true value may be 59.99Hz. A minor difference, but it will eventually cause problems. And there are other factors that can throw this off: a missed vsync, for example, due to process scheduling.<br /><br />The best analogy I can think of is this: have you ever sat in a car and noticed that the turn signals of your car and the car in front of you are in sync?  And then they eventually get out of sync?  Same issue here. No matter how close you get, you will eventually get out of sync and need to adjust.<br /><br />Perhaps I should clarify what I said about resampling before sending to the sound card. I'm not talking about resampling from the APU frequency to 44100Hz. I'm talking about resampling to a variable rate like 44101Hz or 44098.5Hz, etc.<br /><br />In, short, choosing a fixed time base is a dead end. The technique I use in nemulator is this:<br />- sync to 60Hz vblank<br />- generate your audio samples at freq f, and output to the directsound buffer<br />- query directsound for your buffer's playback and write cursor positions<br />- calculate distance between those positions<br />- choose a target distance, say 3000 bytes. This is the amount of data that you are trying to keep buffered<br />- every couple of frames, check how close you are to that target. Let's say you're at 3200 bytes. That means that you are generating too much audio data for your refresh rate. 2800 bytes?  You're generating audio too slowly.  Adjust your audio frequency, f, or playback frequency to compensate.<br /><br />Does this make sense?

Im not sure how to do it well, but, but... i did one thing: i changed the sample rate to 44.671khz so now i have to get the audio every 40 clocks nearly exactly, so the co-processor is not used for float calculations and it seems to sound well.<br /><br />Anyway i wanted to ask you: my emu is generating 744 samples per frame now and i send them to directsound free buffer space. Is this a cpu waste? should i generate more samples? for example taking the output every 2 frames that would be 744*2?<br /><br />Im kinda lost.

Profile it and see.  However, it is probably better to update the buffer every frame as that would reduce the chance of underruns with smaller buffer sizes.
