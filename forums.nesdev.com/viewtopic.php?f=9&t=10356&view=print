I was able to dump a decent amount of NES stuff with the excellent instructions found here:<br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.neogaf.com/forum/showthread.php?p=72806661#post72806661">http://www.neogaf.com/forum/showthread. ... st72806661</a><!-- m --><br /><br />Unfortunately, I am completely stumped as to how to dump SNES games.  Anyone have an &quot;idiots&quot; guide to dump SNES protos with the Kazzo?  Any help would be GREATLY appreciated!

Alright, I guess I should have read more carefully.  That 3rd bullet that reads &quot;While it may be possible to dump original SNES cartridges, the narrow width of the connector pins and differing pitch makes this difficult, and not guaranteed to work.&quot; led me to think that it was capable of dumping, but not guaranteed to work in the process.  My bad.<br /><br />Very happy with the product overall and I plan on contacting you in the future for NES and SNES flashable PCBs.  I'll shoot you an email soon, thanks for the quick response!
