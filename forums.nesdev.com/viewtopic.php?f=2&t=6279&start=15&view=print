<br />
<br />Are you saying that windows takes up more disk space because it's coded in C?
<br />That's silly. the filezise of the same program coded in assembler and C shouldn't differ on more than a few KB.
<br />If you're talking about memory, it's not that far either.
<br />Windows is cluttered with useless things which take up space and that's not the fault of the language they were programmed with.
<br />
<br />Assembler is perfect for little and/or old systems like the NES, plus modern embedded systems, but that's about it.
<br />I dare you develop a modern day operating system in x86 assembler.
<br />C is a great balance between the low level required by operating systems development and the high level required by not spending too much time coding in a language that makes you think more like a machine and less like a human.
<br />Interpreted and Virtual machine languages like Java and .NET, well, that's another story.

<br />Ok, if you just don't like it, that's enough a reason not to use it.
<br />I like both C and assembler as well as other languages and use each where and when I think they fit best.
<br />
<br />And I'm ending this conversation here, because the topic is NES development, and we all agree assembler is the best choice for NES development. OS development is not at all what I'm interested in.

<br />Family Basic. And on the DS there's WarioWare DIY.
<br />
<br />But the problems with trying to develop games on a stock NES are input and RAM. Family Basic had a keyboard, and WarioWare DIY has a touch screen. The DS also has a droppingsload more RAM.
