Whoa whoa whoa, I wouldn't build FunkyFlash especially since it's not finished. I thought you just wanted to use the mapper logic. If you don't mind using socketted ROMs (which you must program with a programmer every time) I think you shouldn't try to use FunkyFlashes PC interface, just keep it to a reconfigurable static cart.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=20">kyuusaku</a> — Thu Jun 07, 2007 7:21 pm</p><hr />

Schematics from FunkyFlash can be directly applied to XC9572 if you create your own constraints file using FunkyFlash's names for pins. I would advise against this though because it will take more experience to do than just starting from scratch. If you need help with the actual mapper logic, then you should turn to FunkyFlash, but implement it yourself. Some of FunkyFlash's mappers cannot be used directly on a XC9572 even though they should; they tend to use more resources than they need to. For example I think MMC2 can fit into a XC9572 but FunkyFlash's will only barely fit into a XC95108 due to the use of larger than necessary registers and some logic which doesn't translate efficiently to CPLD architecture.<br /><br />Please understand that while CPLD are relatively straight forward to use, it will take a while for those new to programmable logic to get caught up to speed. If I were starting over again, I would first get a PowerPak and start designing with that since building your device is 95% of the battle!<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=20">kyuusaku</a> — Wed Jun 06, 2007 7:07 pm</p><hr />

If you are going to be designing with GAL + 74 series, and don't have any GAL experience, you may as well only use 74 series chips since they don't need to be programmed. CPLD on the other hand are in system programmable by using a parallel port cable which you can build yourself from very cheap parts. <br /><br />GALs are VERY cheap (like $2!) The most common are 16V8 and 20V8, if you use GALs for whatever reason you should design around those since most programmers support them. If you want to ONLY use GALs and no 74 series, it would be best to use 22V10 chips since they pack a lot more logic. That would be stupid though since the CPLD I suggested is a dozen times more flexible and easy to use than a handful of 22V10s!<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=20">kyuusaku</a> — Mon Jun 04, 2007 1:26 pm</p><hr />

Just checked the prices for CPLDs... they're really expensive... I doubt I'll be able to find one... Probably just going to have to go NROM. I'll keep my eyes open for a CPLD anyway. Or, at this point, it's probably cheaper to find an actual cartridge and then harvest its mapper chip. Oh and when I said I'd be combining chips, I was refering to memory chips, since most of the ones that are available to me are only 256KBit.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3343">Edge Hypermatter</a> — Wed May 30, 2007 1:13 pm</p><hr />
