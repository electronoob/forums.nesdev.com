		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Hi, I'll resume my development of the rNES library for the PlayPower project, but if you don't know what that is, doesn't matter.
<br />What I wanna know is which PowerPak do I need?
<br />
<br />What I need is having a way to compile a demo and put it in the cartridge to test it in the same way it should work if it was hardwired in a NES ROM cartridge. (Famicom actually)
<br />
<br />I guess the PowerPak Lite will do, right? as the full PowerPak is more targeted to gaming (play many games on the same physical cartridge) while the Lite one will simulate a common cartridge with one game.
<br />
<br />Well thanks in advance for enlightening me.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Depends on what your needs are.  The PowerPak Lite supports a significantly smaller number of mappers than the non-Lite.  The firmware isn't user-upgradable either (unless you're familiar with JTAG, and/or can get the RetroUSB guys to give you the code), so if they extend the mappers on the Lite, you'll have to snail mail them the cart.
<br />
<br />The Lite is intended to be used with a single .NES file, while the non-Lite is intended to be used with multiples.  If you have multiple builds of a game you're working on, it might make sense to use the non-Lite since then you could flash/upload multiples rather than the "try one, reset, re-upload, try next one, reset, re-upload" approach.
<br />
<br />If the Lite has everything you need mapper-wise and PRG/CHR-size-wise, then your overall downtime will be much less with a Lite.  The non-Lite would require you to copy file(s) to a CF plugged into your PC somehow (USB, etc.), wait for it to finish writing, remove CF card, insert into non-Lite, turn on, pick game, pull CF card out, rinse lather repeat.
<br />
<br />The reason I've never bought the PowerPak Lite: lacks MMC3 (mapper #4) support.  Until that's resolved, I won't even bother considering it.

Quite many people seem to be confused about this even tho it's pretty clearly said at the PowerPak website. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />

<br />Do you live somewhere in Asia by any chance? If you don't, I find it really weird that you have a Famicom and not a NES, since the NES is much easier to find (and cheaper) than a Famicom in most places of the globe.
<br />
<br />Now back to your question... I don't remember anyone confirming that the PowerPak works on the Famicom through an adapter, but I don't see why it wouldn't work. What I know for sure is that it doesn't work on Famiclones (at least the NOAC ones, not much testing has been done).

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I live in Argentina, and here the Famicom and its clones are really easier to find than a NES. And almost every cartridge you will find here is for Famicom. Moreover, here in Argentina, the NES/FC platform is widely known as "Family Game" which I believe is the name of the most popular Famicom clone back in the eighties.
<br />
<br />About the Powerpak, in its page it says it works with Famicom but that doesn't work with some cited clones.
<br />
<br />But I don't understand why wouldn't it work with a Famiclone, if, it's supposed to emulate an actual cartridge (no extra hardware is needed to make it work on a NES or Famicom, so the powerpak has to behave like an original cartridge, otherwise the consoles wouldn't run it)
<br />And, Famicom cartridges do work with famiclones, maybe not all of them, but at least all I tried.

<br />
<br />Besides the possible missing signals, clones might not be guaranteed because they may implement things like PPU fetches differently than the original hardware (I think they're cloned maskwork so that likely isn't the case) and that could break mapper implementations.

Here in Brazil it's the same, it's much easier to find clones and 60-pin cartridges than actual NES stuff, but no Famicom though. The Famicom is harder to find than the NES, even though Famiclones are easier.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">But I don't understand why wouldn't it work with a Famiclone, if, it's supposed to emulate an actual cartridge (no extra hardware is needed to make it work on a NES or Famicom, so the powerpak has to behave like an original cartridge, otherwise the consoles wouldn't run it)</div><br />But the PowerPak isn't an ordinary cartridge, it has a boot ROM that configures everything before any games can run. I don't know about the details, but during this setup process it most likely relies on some behavior that's not properly cloned on NOACs. Much like what happens with advanced mappers like the MMC5, which relies on a certain order of memory accesses that the clones do not obey.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">And, Famicom cartridges do work with famiclones, maybe not all of them, but at least all I tried.</div>
<br />Yeah, but some will fail. Clones mimic the general architecture of the NEs, but they don't behave exactly the same. For example, we can see that the colors are usually off in clones, as is the audio, so you can imagine that others things we're not able to see are off as well.
<br />
<br />So, if your console is a clone, don't get a PowerPak. You'd better do it the old school way and get an EPROM programmer, FlashROMs and sockets, and build your own dev carts. But then you won't be 100% sure your code works on the NES, just on your specific clone.

<br />There aren't any other options right now, perhaps the Neo-flash cart if/when it's released. I wouldn't wait though since there's VERY little chance it will be as powerful as the PowerPak or even as reasonably priced.
