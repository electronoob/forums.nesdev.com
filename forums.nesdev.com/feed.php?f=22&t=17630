well there is the case of<br /><br />Yes I have 100 ideas, time to code but not time to make the 100 levels and test it etc. <br /><br />So some people like to just have a list of task to do, which lets you &quot;relieve stress and live the joy of coding a NES&quot; without having to think about or worry about the other stuff. <br /><br />So if somebody wants to do all the level design and just give me a list of &quot;things to do&quot; - works for me.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=8250">Oziphantom</a> — Mon Aug 13, 2018 5:24 am</p><hr />

He can code, he has ideas, he knows graphics artists. What is he missing again then?<br /><br />I'll tell you: He knows a bit of Assembly, but not enough for NES programming and he only has limited time. So, basically, despite being a full-time programmer, he still wants someone to do the majority of the programming for him. Which gets me back to my previous post.<br /><br />If he knows a graphics artist, that's fine. But at least for me I can say:<br />If I had the choice of<br />a) getting a graphics artist right away, but I would have to program someone else's vision or<br />b) looking for a graphics artist myself, but being able to program <em>my</em> game,<br />I know which one I would take.<br /><br />But sure, if anybody wants to work with him on his game, go ahead. Don't let yourself be discouraged by my words.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=6156">DRW</a> — Sun Aug 12, 2018 5:00 am</p><hr />
