If you tie for example CIRAM /CE to ground and CIRAM A10 to CHR A13, you'll definitely get one screen mirroring and no opportunity to have more than one nametable, and have 1kb of CHRRAM mirrored 8 times trough the pattern table. That would only allow 64 tiles to be used at one time.</div>
<br />Now this is a funky thing to try...! Although I doubt that only 64 tiles could be enough for a decent game. On the other hand, since it's RAM, the tiles could be updated to produce the animations, so that only 1 frame of animation is defined at a time, using as little tiles as possible. It's still too little for, say, a platformer or an RPG.
<br />
<br />If you break the 64 tiles in half, 32 for sprites and 32 for the background, only 8 unique metatiles (2x2 tiles) could be defined. Too little for a meaningful background. Careful use of the palettes could make it look like there were more. As for the sprites, if your player is 16x32 pixels in size, it would use 8 tiles, leaving only 24 for enemies and other objects. Maybe enough to define 2 different kinds of enemies and still leave room for a couple of items and such. Sounds doable, but would look pretty plain.
<br />
<br />It's at least curious that this is possible. Maybe it could work for a simple puzzle game. I really don't see the point today, but back in the days of the NES, it might have been cheaper to do simple puzzle games like this.

<br />It would work for at least Tetris, Dr. M, Yoshi, Yoshi's Cookie, Palamedes, and most other puzzle games I've played on NES (except Klax, part of whose playfield is a pseudo 3D projection).

<br />Puzzle or chess game is what comes in mind. Also, I think Memblers' Munchie Attack could probably do this.
<br />Actually there could be a huge PRGROM, with a simple bankswitching system, and no CHR at all (just the circuitery to use the internal CIRAM).
<br />This could be done in emulation using mapper 7, and only write to the first 64 tiles available (and just use pattern table 0 always).

<br />
<br />To bring back this (slightly) old thread, just wanted to mention that I think that's really an excellent idea.  It would work with Munchie Attack, with the minor (and kinda frivolous) exception of the way the title screen scrolls into view.  64 tiles is just enough for it.  Cutting cost down by a couple bucks, one less chip, and less soldering, that's great.  It's totally perfect for making NSF carts!
<br />
<br />Wish I had known about it when I made my UNROM board, it could be rewired easily but the only bad thing is it'd be like the first Garage Cart where I'd have to cut a notch in the cart case so it won't smash the wire to the edge pin.  I'll definitely keep that in mind if I ever revise the PCB.
