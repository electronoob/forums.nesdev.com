<br />
<br /><img src="http://thefox.aspekt.fi/streemerz/streemerz-bgcolor.png" alt="Image" />
<br />
<br />The background color modification is also used for the thunder effect (screen flashes red momentarily). Some of the levels have black silhouettes/shadows in some parts with thunder, so they show through during the red flash:
<br />
<br /><img src="http://thefox.aspekt.fi/streemerz/streemerz-thundersilhouette.png" alt="Image" />
<br />
<br />This can't really be done by changing the background color on the NES, because it makes more sense to reserve it for black since it's used by most tiles. I could reserve 2 colors out of a palette set for it, but not sure if it's worth it given how hard it is to fit the palette limitations as it is... Or I could try just changing the background color (changing the outlines of tiles etc at the same time), it wouldn't look perfect but might be OK.
<br />
<br />Need to start thinking about the palette next. I may write a tool to help in figuring out all the color combos used in every screen and try to go from there...

<br />
<br />Some of the entities have also been merged with the background (balls, hooks and deflectors (the vertical lines)). Pure red is for areas with thunder.
<br />
<br />Balls currently have a transparent background, but because of palette limitations on the NES I'm going to have to make their background black. Same goes for hooks and deflectors. There are also two similar blueish palette sets that the game uses (one with grey, the other with light blue) that I'm going to merge. Should be able to get it down to 4 background palettes then with some minor changes.

There are a bunch of possible solutions for this but I'm going to leave that for later.
<br />
<br />I wrote a (yet another) small tool to check that all the screens of all the levels comply with the palette limitations. They seem to be OK.
<br />
<br />There are 100 metatiles in the tileset right now. Next I need to figure out which one of them each screen uses, how to divide them to sensible groups and how many unique 8x8 tiles there are.

<br />Yeah I think I'm going to use CHR-RAM. I could do 2-3 different metatile sets, switch based on the screen and upload a different tileset each time the screen changes. I also need couple of tiles for the textbox font and borders, but I might be able to fit those in the other CHR bank and switch the background bank on the fly. We'll see, but everything's looking pretty good so far.

Next I'll probably export the collision data, as well as a "grappleable"/death/etc flags for each metatile.
<br />
<br />Map data currently takes 44KB (metatile data not included). ZIP brings it down to about 7KB (16%), but this is for a binary file containing all the screens, in the actual game I need to access them individually. It seems that screen by screen the compression ratio with ZIP tends to be around 33%.
<br />
<br />Can anybody recommend some solution for packing and unpacking the data (preferably with the unpacker already implemented in 6502)? Has anybody used <a href="http://www.cs.tut.fi/~albert/Dev/pucrunch/" class="postlink">pucrunch</a> on an NES project?

<br />I'll keep that in mind. I tried using the aPLib packer on all the levels (individually) and got a total compression ratio of 38.6%. That should do.

<br />Done. I also changed the palette around a bit.
<br />
<br />I'm getting sick of tool coding. It's pretty ridiculous that even the simplest things take hours upon hours to implement. Oh well, NES happens. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />
<br />
<br />Now I can start moving the level stuff over to the asm engine. Then I'll start on the object/entity/sprite stuff.

This case in particular is a bit different though, since you need to do a lot of conversions from the formats that were used in the original game.
<br />
<br />Anyway, it's cool that this game will finally be playable in the console where it belongs! =)

The program I'm currently using, Sothink SWF Decompiler, seems to work pretty well, but the trial version doesn't allow saving the script files (or copying the text from them), and my trial is up in 10 days. The decompiled scripts will be very useful in fine tuning the physics and stuff.
<br />
<br />I moved the level stuff over to my asm engine, it went surprisingly smoothly. I have the sprite from Shatterhand bouncing around the screens, collisions also work as expected.
<br />
<br />Next I need to write a routine to load an arbitrary screen (I think I'm going to use banking for now and keep the ~40K of levels uncompressed), as well as make sure that the collision against the screen above the current one works correctly. Then I have to export the levels (each of which are just a list of screens that the level uses), and then also generate a list of levels for the different game modes.
<br />
<br />After that it's time to start thinking about how to export the objects. Some of the objects I'll convert to level/screen properties.
