		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I just bought a copy of the Super Mario RPG game from the US and would like to play it on (at least one) of my PAL SNES(es). One of them is 50/60hz modded, so I'd prefer to play it on that one, of course. I'm using a Honey Bee Super-Magic Game Converter.
<br />
<br />When powered up the game does absolutely nothing (the TV does acknowledge the SNES getting power, but there are no game graphics on screen). When I try another game, it works (although I sometimes do have to reset it a couple of times to get it working). Maybe the problem is that the rewiring the HB converter doesn't take into account the extra chip inside the game? Or maybe the HB is partially toast/losing contact?
<br />
<br />I'm prepared to do whatever it takes to get the game to work on my PAL SNES (solder, desolder, whatever).

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Super Mario RPG is one of the few Super NES games whose mapper checks the region of the lockout chip in the console. You'll probably have to 1. run your Super NES in 60 Hz and 2. cut and resolder one pin on the cartridge to switch it from expecting a U.S. lock to expecting a European lock.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Hm. My modded SNES has lockout disabled. Is that a problem? The unmodded one does not.
<br />
<br />Also, you can plug a PAL game into the back of the HB converter. I thought that took care of the lockout (if it wasn't disabled in the console already).
<br />
<br />EDIT: OK, I saw story the whole across other forums. So there are two versions of the game. I have the one that needs a working lockout chip in the console to work (version 5, not 3). I'll either get a switch inside the region modded SNES (to connect/disconnect the lockout) or 50/60Hz mod the region unmodded SNES.

<br />Most Super NES games use one-way authentication: the console queries the Game Pak, and the Game Pak operates correctly regardless of the lockout chip signals. This works with the T-connectors, as they route the lockout chip signals to the game in back. The SA-1 coprocessor in SMRPG, on the other hand, uses two-way authentication: the console queries the game as usual, but the game also queries the console. For this to work in the same way as the T-connector, the T-connector would also need to plug in to a console from the appropriate region.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Thanks for the info, tepples.
<br />
<br />All it took was a lifted pin 127 of SA-1 (with the lockout back in) and an Addams Family PAL case (not that I'm a big fan of taking other games apart, but the Addams Family PCB doesn't really need a case that is thrice its size <img src="./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" />).
<br />
<br />The game works perfectly.
