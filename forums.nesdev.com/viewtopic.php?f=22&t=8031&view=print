Sometimes I wonder if the next step will be close enough or am I going to die.</li><li>When teleporting between 2 HTSs on the same screen, it shouldn't flash (unless that was on purpose)</li></ul>Despite all this minor stuff, the game was genuinely fun!

<br />@WJYkK
<br />Thank you for feedback, I'll fix things that are need to be fixed.

<br />Just keep in mind that I'm not a graphics master.<img src="./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" />
<br />
<br />dic-sc7 from emunes.pl forums checked how it works on real hardware.
<br />It have blinking and GFX problems on Famicom, but work good on NES.
<br />After removing Shiru's  famitone from NMI it works fine on Famicom and NES. So there's going to be a fixed version of MOE soon, I hope.

<br />
<br />I haven't checked the old version, but there seems to be some problem in this new version.
<br />
<br />The backpack menu is messed up, when you choose item with up/down the arrow doesn't match with the item position.
<br />
<br />I didn't know this at first but I got stuck, so I checked a youtube video of it and I discover that the backpack menu  has been touched up(the video used an old version of the game) but the arrow still points to the position of the item like in the old version.
<br />
<br />Also, I don't know whether it's my problem or what. I couldn't drop the elevator key as shown in the video, leaving me still stuck on the game.
<br />
<br />P.S. It seems that the game was designed without taking account of the 8-sprite-per-line limit. That's why part of the elevator would disappear when an item was placed there.

<br />
<br />One way is to start OAM on different numbers before the transfer, and the other is to put the objects in your game on the screen in different order each time so they rotate priority.

<br />You don't really "abuse" it... just don't put the same sprites in the same OAM positions every frame. Use whatever method you see fit for randomizing the OAM slots used for drawing your game objects, effectively "shuffling" the sprites (and their priorities, which is the key word here) around every frame.
