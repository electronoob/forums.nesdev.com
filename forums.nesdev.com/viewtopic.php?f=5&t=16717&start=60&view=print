I didn't want to write a mixer, the free-for-commercial-use ones didn't compile or straight crashed at runtime, and the ones that worked required payment.

But you'd be surprised.<br /><br />The original Game Boy Advance had a non-backlit reflective LCD. Its battery light was normally green and turned red when it was low. At certain levels of remaining charge, the light would turn red and green to the beat of the music: mixing more channels (or perhaps driving the audio circuit with more sound) would draw more power. In any case, back when I was homebrewing on the GBA, I could switch the vblank wait between spin-waiting and using the halt SWI and cause the light to change between red and green.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />The saddest part about the GBA is that even though you have the flexibility to push resources for better audio, in the end regardless it's going to be bottlenecked by the piss poor final output mixing.<br /><br />I wish there was an emulator that could rectify that somehow. It's unbelievable how much better the Megaman Zero DS Collection sounds than the GBA originals. They didn't even remaster the assets or anything, the cleaner output of the DS just brings out the true quality. Wish all GBA games could get that treatment.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />If I had to guess it's because the SNES samples probably are compressed to hell. SNES games ranged from 4kbit to I think 32kbit in size (512kbyte to 4mbyte) which encompassed the game code, graphics and any digital audio samples. With finite space they probably had no choice but to compress.<br />With CD-ROM however, even a graphically intense Genesis game could have hundreds of megabytes of space left over that you could use on music and audio samples. Again this is my best guess but I don't think I'm too far off.

Because it's software based, it should make sense to do it.<br /><br />I wish I had fine control over the SPC700's echo delay, because there are so many DSP effects that involve delay manipulation. <br /> I can do some fine control with the FIR filter, but with only a range of 8 samples.

SNES equivalent I suppose is just poor samples, over half the soundtracks had really tiny, terribly looped samples with poor attack parts so that each new note causes a noticable &quot;hiccup&quot;.

The best you can do is mitgate it using the reverb.<br /><br />I actually have a problem with a recurring bass sample (or several ones that are similar) used in SNES music that sounds too bright. Like, it's meant to be a standard soft guitar bass, but there's a problem with the loop that adds this extra clicky oscillation to it that sounds like it's really not meant to be there.

Going beyond will just alias down, and that's how all the noise type sounds work, overflow into semi-random part in the freq range every sample.<br />The waveform view in the tracker is subject to its own artifacts that are determined by the refresh rate and what part of the waveform gets shown. It only shows some amount of the output every once in a while. It is like how car wheels appear to rotate backwards in TV and movies at certain speeds.
