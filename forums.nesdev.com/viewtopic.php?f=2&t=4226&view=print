<br />That had to be done to write the tiles to CHR RAM quickly.  I turned off the PPU and use the white palette.  I didn't wanna write a few at a time.

<br />For a while, I was working on a tile editor that runs on the NES. When switching between "pages" of ten 16x16 pixel patterns, the editor hides the preview in the nametable, copies 10 tiles at a time (using 10 iterations of a 16-byte unrolled copy loop), and then shows the preview again. I'm using the same technique for double buffering of big (32x48 pixel) sprite animations. I can put a demo of my editor on YouTube if you want.

<br />- I noticed you're a good designer. There's a NES pirate (?) collums-style game, but yours look really neat and superb! My congrats and keep up the good work.

<br />
<br />address i: tileset 1
<br />address j: tileset 2
<br />address k: tileset 3
<br />
<br />* user presses NEXT:
<br />- 1st NMI: current tileset is at address k, update nametable
<br />- 2nd NMI: write PREV tileset to address j
<br />- 3rd NMI: write NEXT tileset to address i
<br />- allow user to press NEXT/PREV again

<br />
<br />etc
<br />
<br />Of course, a smarter solution is to only write 1 tileset, since the PREV tileset is already in VRAM after pressing NEXT, but you get the idea.

<br />
<br />I also think a Tetris-Attack styled combo/chain number popup would be neat to have as an option as an easier way to tell how long of a chain has been made...
<br />
<br />Also, yeah, if you're going ot turn off PPU you could always just use the black palette (less intrusive), or even make it into an effect by writing the leftmost tiles to the rightmost tiles in order (2/frame), or backwards for previous ...

This is really professional looking, and also the music/sound engine is good too. If you handed this game to me, I'd think that it was made by a team of developers. I'd also be quite addicted to it =). Good job!

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Agreed- this looks like a pretty solid title.  I don't mind the white flash- it's not as if it's going on in real gameplay- but if you're really picky you could just stuff each tileset in the same location in your CHR bank and use MMC3 or another mapper to just switch the appropriate quarter-bank.
<br />
<br />I like the music you've come up with so far.  I can generally arrange a tune to take full advantage of the pAPU, but coming up with an original is a bit harder.
<br />
<br />Out of curiosity, is that all background, or are the jewels sprites as they come down?

<br />
<br />The jewels and the "Next jewel" are sprites and get rendered into BG.  The points gained (that small, unlabeled box in the middle) are also sprites.
<br />
<br />MMC3 isn't really an option for cart form as that'll add a lot more cash to make and it's not worth it.  The white flash only lasts for 2 frames and I'm not going to worry about it.
