<br />The PPU fetches name tables, attribute tables and BG pattern table for a part of the scanine and fetches sprite pattern table for the other half. This cycle is repeated one time per scanline. If you place the BG patterns at $0000-$0fff and sprite pattern at $1000-$1fff, this will cause A12 to be low during all BG pattern fetches and to be high during all sprite fetches, providing one rising edge per scanline. If you don't respect this condition, A12 will do something else and cause additional clocks on the counter.
<br />
<br />The IRQ clock occurs as sprite evaluation begins.

<br />
<br />Anyway, perhaps I'm not being clear..? Sprites are evaluated during the pre-scanline (-1) *and* in the dummy scanline (240)?

<br />I misread this question.  For some reason I thought you were asking about the pre-render and the 240 regular scanlines.

<br />The dummy scanline after rendering does <em>not</em> clock the counter.  Sorry about that  &gt;_&lt;.

<br />
<br />Heck, one more thing: you mentioned previously about a latency of 13 CPU (?) cycles between A12 rises "in your emu". Do you confirm it? Plus, since I use a CHR cache system, there's no problem if I rely on PPU cycle timing for A12 rises, like (ppucycle&amp;7)-4 for CHR/Nam fetches..? ppucycle=0 up to 340.

<br />
<br />PPU cycle resolution should be good.
<br />
<br />As with any IRQ, you should be able to predict when it's going to happen before it actually happens.  This gets trickier with 8x16 sprites, though, as they can fetch CHR from either pattern table.. so whether or not A12 rises may depend on which sprites are found to be inrange on a given scanline.

<br />
<br />Ooooooh.  That.  No I still don't know of a definative number.  The gap between A12 rises has to be over 13 dots, though, otherwise Armadillo will break (it has pattern table assignment reverse from the norm -- and if you use a smaller gap, the IRQ counter will count each scanline twice!)

Nowhere I could find does it say the CHR fetch happens on 258.  Could you paste where it says that?<br /><br />In any event... The first 256 cycles (0-255) are BG NT/Attribute/CHR fetches.  There are 32 tiles, each tile taking 4 fetches, and each fetch taking 2 cycles.  32 * 2 * 4 = 256.  This means the fetches for the first sprite occurs between cycles 256-263.  Just like with the BG, sprites have 4 fetches, each fetch taking 2 cycles each.  The first two fetches are BG/Attribute bytes (from ppu $2xxx -- where A12 is low).  These fetches are discarded and unused -- but they take 4 cycles total, meaning the first CHR fetch is on cycle 260 (256 + 4).<br /><br />BT's doc confirms this:<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">Memory fetch phase 129 thru 160<br />-------------------------------<br />1.

And the Pattern table bitmap (CHR) is the 3rd fetch here (+ 4 cycles).<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">- Does the sprite CHR fetch occur when sprites are disabled?</div>
<br />
<br />Yes.  As long as the PPU is "on" (as long as either sprites <em>or</em> BG are enabled).
