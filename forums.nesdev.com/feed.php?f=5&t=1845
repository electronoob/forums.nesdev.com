Assuming it's 32megabit and unboxed, in fair condition, it's worth around $40. This doesn't mean you couldn't get $200 for it on eBay from some ignorant gamers. While they are very common as old junk in Chinese territories now, they were very expensive, rare and sought after by western collectors until only a few years ago. Many gamers still don't know they exist and will still spend a lot of money to satisfy their dirty piracy fantasies (when emulators aren't enough)<br /><br />I'm not sure how you'd install a CDROM in it, it only contains a floppy disk controller ;) You'd have to decode in some registers and write software to talk to a CDROM on a very low level. On a software level, you'd need to either add CDROM functions to the PFX's BIOS or learn how PFX manages it's memory so that you could write your own game loader from scratch that is loaded as a ROM file.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=20">kyuusaku</a> — Thu Jul 27, 2006 9:46 pm</p><hr />

Hey all... first post ^_^.<br />I have a Pro Fighter X for SNES (saves SNES carts to 3.5" disk and allows one to play SNES ROMs saved on 3.5" disk). I was just wondering if any of you has one or knows about how much they're worth. I've never seen one on eBay or anything. (Sorry, I'm not interested in selling it... just curious.) I bought it from someone for $5. Also, has anyone ever installed a CD drive on one? I opened the thing up and it looked kind of... cheap inside... so I'm afraid to try to add new stuff to it. <br />&lt;3 &lt;3 kthxbi &lt;3 &lt;3<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=795">Rachel</a> — Thu Jul 27, 2006 6:50 pm</p><hr />
