<br />I code my emulator on the old Amiga (running at 50Mhz at best) and of course performance is a huge issue for me, and I'm constantly looking for ways to optimize and speed things up, but I guess that's part of the fun aswell. I have to trade some compability against speed, but I guess I can live with that for now.
<br />
<br />I'm a bit interested in how you guys deal with the graphics concerning NES emulation. Do you have any clever ways of updating the backgroundgraphics/sprites? Would be cool to hear if you're using any clever "tricks". <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":-)" title="Smile" />

<br />PocketNES runs games at full speed on a 16.8 MHz CPU by drawing the NES tiles and sprites using Game Boy Advance tiles and sprites.

<br />
<br />My CPU core runs realtime, it's the graphics that are the problem and takes up too much time. 
<br />I avoid drawing the same tile twice and stuff like that. I usually log most PPU related activity and at the end of each frame I combine a final screen by parsing these logs. This gives an "ok" result, except for the speed-concern.
<br />
<br />Would be interesting to hear how people made their NES graphicsengines. If people are simply drawing pixel by pixel or some other clever way to speed things up.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />If sprite hit zero is not used, you can log various registers as rendering would happen and then actually render the screen all at once which may help with speed based on either cache size or overhead performance. If sprite hit zero is used then you may need to draw the screen up to that point. But usually it happens higher up on the screen so you could still get a boost by being able to render most of the screen in one big chunk. 
<br />
<br />Really it's just about doing things the quickest way possible with the least amount of waste while still accomplishing the tasks needed for accuracy/compatibility. This can vary for some games. Mega Man for example you could get by with some very quick PPU code since it doesn't do much to complicate things. Infact any game that doesn't split the screen for a status bar, doesn't bankswitch to animate CHR, or do anything else strange you could probably just draw the nametables once and then just render them to the screen as well as updating them as the game does and save yourself alot of time as there wouldn't be much PPU calculations going on at that point. 
<br />
<br />But ofcourse like I said that's only if the game can get by with that.
<br />
<br />I remember working on my emulator I found that running in 8bit (256 color) mode was significantly faster. I was specifically developing for an older Pentium 2 where performance was an issue. One thing I found out was directly manipulating video memory was much faster. So rather than drawing pixels on the screen by loading 8bit values and putting them into place I loaded 32bit values and was drawing 4 pixels at a time. 
<br />
<br />I'm sure there were other things. Profiling type functions are very helpful for figuring out where all your CPU time is going.

<br />
<br />I did a graphics demo for XBox360 that used a fragment shader for 100% of the rendering process. It's quite fun, and a learning experience to say the least <img src="./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" />
