		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Computers can't really generate true random numbers -- instead they use "pseudo random number generators" which use math formulas which produce numbers which appear to be random.  They work by taking an initial value (the 'seed'), running it through a math formula, and outputting the result -- while using that result as the seed for the next generated number.  On PCs and other newer systems these formulas are probably done with heavier math operations, but on older systems they were accomplished with simple bitshifting and XOR operations (and possibly with some addition as well).
<br />
<br />As Bregalad suggested, check that site and look at the PRNGs.  You're probably better off using a premade one than trying to write your own -- as making a good one can be somewhat difficult (it's actually kind of hard to come up with a formula where the numbers don't appear to follow an obvious pattern).

<br />
<br />To get some actual randomness, you have to get a seed from the only part of the system that you can never predict.  And that's the person playing the game.  You can increment the seed while waiting for the user on the title screen for example, because you never know exactly what microsecond and frame it will be when they press the start button.

<br />Oh really? Player loads the NES with Tetris, turns on "slow motion" feature of a third-party controller, which rapidly presses Start, and then turns on the NES. This causes the game to seed the PRNG based on the pre-defined control stream sent by the controller. Because there is only one such control sequence, there will be only one random number seed and thus one possible sequence of pieces. Play by memory.
<br />
<br />Even without a slow motion feature, most people can time it to get one of about ten random sequences if you base the seed only on the number of frames elapsed during the title screen.

<br />
<br />I think this would also work sometimes by just holding the start when you turn the system on.  If the game is only checking if the button is pressed, rather than looking for a change in the button state.  This is a slight problem with the Game Genie too IIRC.  Perhaps they should've done what I did on the Garage Cart's menu and go only after start is released.

<br />
<br />Yep, which is also why I mentioned microseconds in addition to frames.  If it mattered enough, the program could have the idle loop doing it's usual wait for vblank, but also reading the controller and incrementing the seed.  That would make reproducing a seed much tougher.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Thanks, blargg, I had one wich was accurate, but much more complicated, it needed 4 seeds and 4 temp registers.
<br />A good way to test the acuracy of a random number generator is to put the outpout to $4011, then call it again, etc... If you hear a noise wave, you're sure that it is accurate.
<br />Memblers, your trick isn't stupid at all. I think that Dragon Warrior does something like that on it's title screen.

<br />But how much empty space was there in the Game Genie ROM to put this extra safeguard in?
