Adjusting just about anything is a pain - I'd remove up/down and make left/right smarter and display the current dot offset if I could simply add it.

Can we get it onto real hardware to see if the PPU v-register write delay actually exists?  And, possibly to measure that delay?

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Turns out it wasn't too bad to simplify the controls! Phew. Also managed to print the current offset. I'd still like to add an explanation in there and move the tiles down, but that's for another time.<br /><br />Press right or left to increase or decrease the dot offset by one, respectively.<br /><br />For example, in nintedulator: the second &quot;sta 0x2006&quot; starts at dots 236-237 at offset 0, and dots 244-245 at offset 8 (max).<br />Offset 0-5: t-&gt;v happens before the Y inc.<br />Offset 6: t-&gt;v happens both before and after the Y inc. (shakes)<br />Offset 7-8: t-&gt;v happens after the Y inc.<br /><br />Do note that this is simply what nintendulator does, other emulators and hardware might differ.<br /><br />As per usual, you can get the latest version from <a href="https://github.com/FredYeye/2nd2006/raw/master/roms/2nd2006_next_level.nes" class="postlink">github</a> (direct link to the rom).

All of these games have &quot;glitches&quot; on the screen due to imperfect screen splits, so I am assuming that the way the glitch displays may be slightly affected by this change.<br /><br />Pre-fix, Mesen only displays the test's triangles properly at offset 7 &amp; 8. (Offset 6 = unstable picture)<br />Post-fix, the triangles display properly for offsets 5, 6, 7 &amp; 8.  (Offset 4 = unstable picture)<br /><br />So, this would still need to be validated on a NES, but it seems like the delay on the VRAM update after a $2006 write may actually be a thing.<br /><br />Edit: It also fixes the screen shaking during the introduction sequence in Wizards &amp; Warriors III (USA).

(i.e how are the triangles displayed for each of the 8 offset values)<br />The actual result is probably hidden on CRTs due to overscan, but I'm assuming capture cards should still be able to record it?<br /><br />At the moment, (in Mesen) this change fixes Bart vs. the Space Mutants and Wizards &amp; Warriors III.  It also lets me remove an old patch I had implemented for Kick Master (and Kick Master still works correctly). Also, it makes blargg's full palette demo perfectly centered, instead of left aligned (and sometimes having 1 pixel cut off on the left side of the screen).

The primary difference between them is that version 970 contains a hack in which the X and Y increments occur 4 PPU cycles earlier than their actual scheduled times.  It sounds likely that the delayed v-register write may fix that problem there also.<br /><br />What was the Kick Master issue?
