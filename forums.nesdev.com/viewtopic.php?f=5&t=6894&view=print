<br />
<br />I wouldn't really define a game as an engine alone. A game is made up of an engine and data that the engine processes. Given that, I'm not sure I quite understand the question. Would you mind elaborating a little more?

<br />You can when it comes with a demo level made of pieces of the test case levels used in the engine's <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development" class="postlink">test-driven development</a>. Technically, this is a game, but it's one that players expecting a more substantial game will call "steaming pile of tech demo".

<br />
<br />One could argue that a screen with a single red square that you can move around is a sandbox game.  Set your own goals!  See how fast you can move it side to side!  See if you can get the square to sit in the exact corner of the screen!

At first they seem like part of the engine, but there's not really anything in the actual engine code that defines 00 = air, 01 = solid, 02 = ramp, it's really the character's AI that defines what number value goes with what kind of tile.  For example in a Mario game you can make an enemy fall through a ramp tile if you don't program the enemy's AI to react to a ramp tile like a ramp tile.

<br />Not necessarily. All the collision could be coded in functions shared by all objects, and the objects would just have to use the functions or not. Technically, those functions are part of the engine, the objects themselves just make calls to them.
