Have you thought of adding torches or something?</div><br /><br />I was thinking of using these textures in a couple different castle areas, so I would adjust the colors to make them look distinct from each other.<br />I was thinking of having the windows be a third palette and then having lightning strike randomly, and the windows flash when that happens.  (Well, maybe just in one of the castles.  But I guess the other ones could use the same palette as the foreground.)<br /><br />Torches?  Ooh, I like that idea.<br /><br />Statues sounds good too; I was thinking about adding suits of armor.  Also, crests, curtains, and some crossbars for the lower areas to make them look like a dungeon.<br />But of course, before I spend two weeks with all of the detail, I want to make sure the basic design looks good.<br /><br />I was inspired by Batman's maps, how they look so dark and moody by having a lot of blank tiles, and the area that do have tiles fade to black.<br /><br />Any thoughts about the stairs?

I don't really get the back on them though, I'd just get rid of that part.

Half of pictures I've seen in games, movies, etc. don't fully go from one side of the color wheel to the next, as it doesn't make any sense 90% of the time, and I feel that this falls within that percentage.<br /><br />It's like this picture: (They're way to high resolution to show here)<br /><br /><a href="http://img14.deviantart.net/518f/i/2006/118/6/9/ocean_sunset_by_ryafacan.jpg" class="postlink">http://img14.deviantart.net/518f/i/2006/118/6/9/ocean_sunset_by_ryafacan.jpg</a><br /><br />Versus this picture:<br /><br /><a href="http://www.hdwallpapersnew.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/ocean-sunset-high-resolution-wallpaper-for-desktop-background-images.jpg" class="postlink">http://www.hdwallpapersnew.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/ocean-sunset-high-resolution-wallpaper-for-desktop-background-images.jpg</a><br /><br />There's so much unnecessary contrast in the second picture that it almost looks unnatural.<br /><br />Like I said though, he could insert torches. That would make more sense and look more visually appealing for contrast in my opinion, but I personally feel that it's pretty good as it is.
