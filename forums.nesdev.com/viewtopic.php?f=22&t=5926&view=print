Adding a controversial backstory doesn't really make it any better. You can of course spend your time making whatever game you like, but if your goal is to please a good number of players you are surely going the wrong way.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">So what am I supposed to make by myself?

<br />That's even more unoriginal than concentration! Seriously though, the answer to this question depends on what you seek when developing games. Are you after money? Then hear what the community wants to play and make that regardless of how much you like it. Is it for challenge? Make something complex that hasn't been done before. You want quantity? Make a series of simple games that take you 1 or 2 months. Sense of accomplishment? Make a masterpiece of a game, however unlikely it is that you'll finish it. Fun while developing? Do whatever the fuck you want no matter what anyone else thinks and says and have fun!
<br />
<br />There's usually a combination of goals though, so you probably gotta have priorities. Whatever goal is more important, you will have to make sacrifices. For me, the easiest thing to give up is money, or else I wouldn't be coding Sonic. I never expected to make money out of my hobbies, so fun and sense of accomplishment are up high on my list.

<br />I guess I want all or most of them at some point, but I understand that working alone I can't have them all at the same time. Is there a way I can combine "quantity greater than zero" and "money" and "fun" to get at least one finished game under my belt?
<br />
<br /><strong>I am ready to replace this game's backstory entirely</strong> if it will make it more attractive to players. Suggestions are welcome.

Inventory management software for a warehouse?</div><br />You didn't pour time and effort into President?  I thought I saw some significant planning, at least.<br /><br />Did you actually receive a C&amp;D from some lawyer, or are you just acting as if copyright law poses a significant threat in this case?  Bear in mind that removal of a Youtube video is not really grounds for anything.<br /><br />To put these legal matters in perspective, I would recommend reading <a href="http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1029151" class="postlink">this document</a> (beginning at page 543).  It illustrates why we cannot hope to remain guiltless in the face of copyright law, and why many of us keep telling you to just relax. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">To  illustrate  the  unwitting  infringement  that  has  become  quotidian  for  the average American, take an ordinary day in the life of a hypothetical law professor named John. For the purposes of this Gedankenexperiment, we assume the worst-case  scenario  of  full  enforcement  of  rights  by  copyright  holders  and  an uncharitable,  though perfectly plausible,  reading of existing case  law and  the  fair use doctrine. Fair use is, after all, notoriously fickle and the defense offers little ex ante refuge to users of copyrighted works.<br /> <br />In the morning, John checks his email, and, in so doing, begins to tally up the liability. Following common practice, he has set his mail browser to automatically reproduce  the  text  to  which  he  is  responding  in  any  email  he  drafts.  Each unauthorized  reproduction  of  someone  else’s  copyrighted  text—their  email—represents  a  separate  act  of  brazen  infringement,  as  does  each  instance  of  email forwarding.<br /><br /> Within  an  hour,  the  twenty  reply  and  forward  emails  sent  by  John have exposed him to $3 million in statutory damages.</div><br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">By  the  end  of  the  day,  John  has  infringed  the  copyrights  of  twenty  emails, three  legal  articles,  an  architectural  rendering,  a  poem,  five  photographs,  an animated  character,  a  musical  composition,  a  painting,  and  fifty  notes  and drawings. All told, he has committed at least eighty-three acts of infringement and faces liability in the amount of $12.45 million (to say nothing of potential criminal charges).<br /><br /> There is nothing particularly extraordinary about John’s activities. Yet if  copyright holders were  inclined  to  enforce  their  rights  to  the maximum  extent allowed by law, barring last minute salvation from the notoriously ambiguous fair use  defense,  he would  be  liable  for  a mind-boggling  $4.544  billion  in  potential damages each year. And,  surprisingly, he has not even committed a  single act of infringement  through  P2P  file-sharing.  Such  an  outcome  flies  in  the  face  of  our basic sense of justice. Indeed, one must either  irrationally conclude that John is a criminal  infringer—a veritable grand  larcenist—or blithely surmise that copyright law must not mean what  it appears  to say. Something  is clearly amiss. Moreover, the  troublesome gap between  copyright  law  and norms has  grown only wider  in recent years.</div>

It seems you have already put a lot of work on it, and many players in the retro gaming scene want to play a good scrolling platformer, and there are no copyright problems. Don't start talking about graphics again... "simple graphics" is not the same as "bad graphics", and from what I've seen of your sprites your style kinda looks like what the first gen NES games used, and that's cool since you're making NES games, it's a valid style. I'm sure people will buy your game even if it doesn't look like a SNES game.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"><strong>I am ready to replace this game's backstory entirely</strong> if it will make it more attractive to players.

<br />Can't help you there, I don't give a damn about the storyline of most games, I usually just START my way through the screens as quickly as I can until gameplay starts. If it takes too long and I didn't pay for the game or haven't heard good things about it I can even give up before gameplay starts. It happens a lot when I'm just browsing through ROM packs.

<br />True, but plans tend to change once my other responsibilities change.
<br />
<br />As for the rest: You make a point that LJ65 might not be flagged as quickly. Legally, I think I might be in the right given the different graphical styles and the 'scenes a faire' doctrine, but practically, he who has the gold makes the rules. It isn't just the YouTube video; it was also an actual lawsuit <em>The Tetris Company LLC v. Biosocia Inc.</em>, filed in an actual New York court. The impression I got from Tetris in 2009 was "We're coming to get someone (<em>Tetris v. Biosocia</em>), and the next someone could be you (video takedown)." But perhaps the fact that <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcVGsOpw3Xw" class="postlink">the LJ65-specific video</a> didn't get taken down instead might indicate that Arika was going after Heboris or Texmaster, games that directly clone features that Arika added to its own Tetris games.
<br />
<br />Not to mention a few persistent trolls on Slashdot who call me a plagiarist for having made Luminesweeper and Lockjaw, and then their posts get moderated up. I don't even have any non-falling-block games to put on the front page of <a href="http://www.pineight.com/" class="postlink">my web site</a>. Now it should be easier to see where my drive for quantity comes from.

<br />Shiru on IRC suggested a plot based on an accident at a chemical plant, where accidental creation and release of a neurotoxin forces the player to keep the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentration" class="postlink">concentration</a> down by keeping his <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attention" class="postlink">concentration</a> up while in quarantine.

<br />
<br />You should put back effort on your President game engine, this would be a good thing. Do like me and take some actual sprites from another game to build the engine and once you're ready, just make your own original game. This is one of my goal. Just remake one level of some game to make your engine work then after that it should be easier to make your own original one.
<br />
<br />As for the suggested story with toxin and things like that, I think it really a better choice and you should go for that one.  Some topic are more sensible than other ones  and the current one used for your game was not a good choice.

It looked like it was going to be pretty cool, and I would definitely be excited to see progress on it. And I actually am still interested in playing this card game you made, even as-is. I don't hate puzzle games; I actually enjoy them from time-to-time. I just believe that they are more like mini-games than stand-alone games. After a while, it just gets repetitive. But for a while it can be loads of fun. And hey, maybe it'll be one of those addictive games like Helicopter (that flash one you play with the mouse where you move the helicopter up and down, trying to not hit solid objects. And each time you play the level is different) that you'll keep trying even if it gets repetitive. So I'd like to give it a shot.
<br />
<br />And even if not many people are jumping up and down to play a puzzle game, I still think you should know your efforts on this project are not worthless. If nothing else it is a big learning experience, whether or not you think so. Even making something like "The Game" has taught me a lot, despite the fact that there's barely any substance behind the game. But I know that if you work on President, you'll make a lot of people happy here, and people will be even happier when they see the finished product.
