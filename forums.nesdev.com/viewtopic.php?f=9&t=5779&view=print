		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Do you have the latest firmware? Small card support was added recently, although I'm not positive on the exact bottom. 
<br />
<br />I have a Sandisk 8GB card in mine, so it supports at least 32MB to 8GB cards and probably larger, although anything beyond a 2GB card is overkill. I shoved an 8GB card in mine because my 1GB card died on me and I only had 8GB cards left on hand. I'm pretty sure that every dump of every NES/Fami/FDS game would total under 2GB.
<br />
<br />The major two things to remember are:
<br />
<br />Use directories and keep only a few titles in each, as storing too many file in one tree causes a slowdown of the UI. (Just like it can on older servers…) 
<br />
<br />The PowerPak doesn't sort games by any means at all: It polls the file system data directly and displays it as it reads it. This means that if you want an alphabetical list of the games, you must copy the dumps over in alphabetical order AND you must create directories in alphabetical order while copying the dumps. 
<br />
<br />(e.g. Make a 0-9 dir, then copy games beginning with numbers in numerical order, then create an "A" directory, copy the A-named games, then a "B" directory and so on.)
<br />
<br />This will usually result in an alphabetical list of your games. Too bad the developer didn't include a bit of logic into the FPGA that did sorting from the PowerPak side without using the NES CPU. That would have been pretty awesome, but time consuming...
<br />
<br />In any event, you are pretty safe with almost any CF card. The PowerPak isn’t too picky, so long as it is a FAT32 formatted CFC. Check the latest firmware docs too, as it may even support FAT12/16 now...
