If you'd like full connectivity I'd recommend purchasing that.  I have no interest in the large amount of manual machining needed to hack off the shelf components to mate with all exp pins.  Using my method here to mate with all/many exp pins is also impractical.  I did have a connector company quote the manufacture of proper exp female connectors and it was prohibitively expensive.  Starting around $10k for a few connectors, and upwards of $30k for a decent per unit cost.<br /><br />Those are all things I considered before landing on this idea since my primary goal was providing a means to make the audio resistor mod solderless while also being easily manufactured.  This device meets that goal.

I'm somewhat hopeful the stm32f030 running ~48Mhz with dual PWM DAC may be able to decently replicate some original audio expansions like VRC6, sunsoft5b, &amp; FDS.  I've yet to even start tinkering with them enough to be confident an stm32f0 will be adequate.  Another consideration I've had is the stm32f051 as it includes a built in DAC for close to the price of a standalone DAC.</div><br /><br />It looks like a single-cycle multiplier is optional in the M0 parts, that would be nice to have, if possible.  4 audio channels mixed at 48khz will be 192k multiplies per second.  I'm sure that CPU could power through it anyways (maybe 20-30 cycles per multiply?).  Those chips are mostly wavetable, so it'd be like one 24 or 32-bit addition, indexing sample, multiply, 16 or 24-bit add+accumulate.  Number of CPU cycles that all takes * number of channels * sample rate.  STM8 w/ multiplier likely could also passably emulate those chips at 48khz (probably best if coded in asm), compared to the M0 w/o multiplier the performance is probably about the same at the same clock rate (which it's not, so M0 comes out ahead <img src="./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" />))<br /><br />I wonder how much those Cortex M4 with DSP features cost, I haven't checked.  I noticed the PIC32MK is a new family that's around $5 with features that would be killer for audio, multiply+accumulate, saturation math, 1-cycle SIMD instructions, even floating point.  Unfortunately they totally borked the parallel port slave mode on that one (would allow the NES to interface directly with the MCU).  That port does work on the PIC32MZ but those parts are like $1.50 more (w/ more memory of course).  I figure with that kind of MCU I should be able to do 32-channel audio with Squeedo 2.0, overkill extreme. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />Anyways, a lot of the stuff I'm saying here is probably already known, I'm just kinda thinking out loud.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">I imagine you would want an external clock too, if using an RC oscillator the audio will be out of tune.</div> Yes that's a good point, another potential solution would be to use a NES clock source multiplied by a PLL if the mcu provides one.   But most internal RC oscillators are tuneable, perhaps the mcu could finely tune itself with a calibration routine at boot/post warmup.<br /></div><br /><br />One problem that shows up is that when the composer uses the NES and detuned expansion audio together, normally when you play a slightly detuned note in 2 channels you will get a phasing or &quot;beating&quot; effect (this is often used as an effect), if it's the same note+octave there are also cancellation effects (absolute worst case is summing 2 square waves perfectly aligned on opposite phases, the result would be a constant zero).  The downside could be minimized by telling composers avoid using the same note on both soundchips, but to some degree it will still sound different on everyone's system.  If the effect is noticable on different octaves too, then this becomes pretty darn hard to avoid. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_neutral.gif" alt=":|" title="Neutral" />  I don't know if people would consider it endearing or janky, could go either way but I'm sure that some chiptuners won't like that aspect of it.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />That does indeed sound like electromagnetic interference/cross talk. Your ext audio line basically acts as an antenna loop, but this alone isn't an explanation. In general terms, a reason you might experience it in certain configurations but not others is if a line carrying the 60hz buzz suddenly increases in peak to peak voltage relative to audio peak to peak; becoming strong enough to influence your audio line. Or conversely; if your audio signal is too weak/cold (for example due to some opamp getting unexpected input) and then amplified/buffered up to standard volume again, thus also amplifying any crosstalk picked up along the way.<br /><br />Avoid letting audio lines (victim) run in parallel to any line that might carry 60hz AC (source). You can often help isolate your audio signal with embedding or twisting it with a GND line (though here, much of the line is on the PCB). Ferrite beads on power line wires can also help. If not helping or applicable, a more thorough source/victim analysis should be conducted.<br /><br />As last resort, you could implement a sharp high- or bandpass or comb filter at 60hz (+ harmonics), but a circuit breaker is probably much better anyway at this point.<br /><br />EDIT: what are the typical pvp voltages of the ext. audio line, anyway? And what are they when you hear the noise? I was thinking an alternative (and very circumstantial) solution would be using reverse-direction germanium diodes, which typically have a breakdown voltage of 0.3v, sometimes less. You can get very fine tuned new-old-stock germanium diodes from anywhere in the former east bloc with even lower breakdown voltages. They could effectively act as a passive circuit breaker when the signal is low enough. The smaller the breakdown voltage, the more inaudible the difference would be when it is actually supposed to be sound on the line. They were used for this very purpose (signal detection) in radar systems, among other things. I could send a couple in a month if you want to experiment.<br /><br />You can get even better results by gate:ing only the lower end of the spectrum this way, but that makes for a bit larger (still passive) circuit. Plus, filters affect phase (normally not audible).

If you've got some more elaborate setup with actual wires and such that would be my first guess as to the source of the problem.  I've been recommending people solder the resistor directly to the EXP connector, and also been using an ENIO myself for a few years now and never heard of such issues.  So honestly I'm not too worried about it.  Good news is it's solderless, so worst case it's easy to remove rendering your console completely stock.  This design has pretty minimal tracing comparable to soldering the resistor directly to the EXP connector.  The EXP connector socket itself even has some shielding around it which might help.

I've been recommending people solder the resistor directly to the EXP connector, and also been using an ENIO myself for a few years now and never heard of such issues.</div><br />It's two wires from the two pins on the opposite side of the expansion port (EXP / Audio) connected to a 100k pot mounted on the back of the NES. (The pot also has a disconnect.) I'd have to take my NES apart to check, but I think they just run in a straight line to the left hand side of the NES and then along the border of the case to the rear-left of the NES where the pot is. The two wires are probably twisted together.<br /><br />This noise <em>only</em> happens with a few specific NES cartridges. On most (including PowerPak, or Famicom carts with expansion audio through an adapter) there is no audible difference between disconnected or not.<br /><br />Though, I would also say that it's pretty normal for there to be similar noise on the NES' audio to begin with, unrelated to the mod. The only reason I can distinguish this noise from <em>that</em> noise is that I do have a volume knob and disconnect switch that I can use to turn it on and off and hear the difference. If I had just soldered a 47k resistor directly to the board I'd have no way of knowing the difference between buzzing coming through that or from other normal sources, since I wouldn't be able to turn it off by itself. (So... &quot;never heard of such issues&quot; isn't really good evidence that the problem doesn't exist, in my view? You'd have to have a way to compare to be able to notice. I'm not electrical engineer though, so I can't speculate whether this is a plausible problem for the adapter, just it's something that seems to be one for my mod.)<br /><br />Also, having an easily accessible pot is very useful, even if you only want to use it with a PowerPak-- the PowerPak's expansion audio implementations are <em>not</em> very well balanced, IMO.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">FrankenGraphics wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">(various suggestions) but a circuit breaker is probably much better anyway at this point.</div><br />Yes, the disconnect switch already solves the problem completely. I really would not want to build some sort of filter or gate in there, the whole point is to <em>receive</em> the expansion audio!
