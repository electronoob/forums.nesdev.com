		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Hello all,
<br />
<br />I implemented mapper #002 (UxROM) a while back.  This is a very simple mapper and I've never had problems playing any UxROM games....save one - Contra.  Whenever I try to play Contra the game _totally_ freaks out (although the title screen is perfectly fine.  The graphics are messed up really bad (to the point where you can't even make out any objects at all - just random pixels all over).  I can't see how there could be something wrong with my mapper given that it's such a simple mapper and that every other UxROM game I've tried plays fine.  So that leads me to believe it a major problem with my emu.
<br />
<br />Is there anything "special" or esoteric about Contra?  Does it rely on some specific functionality/feature in order to play properly?  My emulator is not complete (most specifically my audio core is very lacking and I do have some bugs in my CPU/PPU) but I would expect Contra to play at least reasonably well even if there were a glitch or two. But to be _completely_ unplayable?
<br />
<br />Just curious.  If no one has any ideas I will just not worry about it until after I get my APU core done and fix more CPU/PPU bugs.
<br />
<br />Thanks!
<br />
<br />Jonathon

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Definitely check for CPU bugs. As you said, there is nothing special about Contra. It's easy to emulate. I don't believe it uses any tricks or has timing critical issues. I've never heard anyone mention Contra as a problem game so I'm thinking CPU bug as well and not anything to do with the NES registers or PPU so much. But anything is possible. Strange that it would only have such a negative effect on one game. Maybe there are others you could find if you really went on a testing spree.
<br />
<br />I'm guessing you passed all the CPU test roms?

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Hmm...I played lifeforce for a while and didn't have any problems.  I pass all these CPU tests:
<br />
<br />- Flubba's NEStress
<br />- Kevtris' nestest
<br />- Blargg's nes_cpu_test5 (official only)
<br />- Blargg's nes_intr_test (official only)
<br />- Blargg's cpu_timing_test6
<br />- Blargg's branch_timing_tests
<br />- Blargg's nes_intr_timing (instr_timing - official only)
<br />- Blargg's nes_intr_timing (branch_timing)
<br />
<br />I'm going to try and put my CPU-logger utility to work on this one and compare it to FCEUX debug output.
<br />
<br />Like I said, I do still have some CPU bugs and I don't want to send a ton of people just wildly guessing (as that really isn't the proper way to debug).  But I thought I might just get lucky with you NES gurus (after all, it's happened multiple times before!). If I find the bug I will let you all know so that someone else may be able to benefit from it in the future.
<br />
<br />Thanks all!
