After re-reading my earlier post, it's a little more  confrontational than I meant it to be, sorry about that.  I didn't mean to criticize anyones choice of language, just to point out how that choice can affect the applications usefulness to different end users.  I'm a little touchy on this subject.

The only reason I coded my app in C# was because I hadn't done anything in C# before, and this seemed like a good opportunity to exploit the language and its advantages. I think it's an interesting language, but I'm not going to write any other applications in it mostly because everything done in C++ is just a lot more portable and faster. What do I think about Java? It's nothing but a castrated C++.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=22">Hyde</a> — Tue Nov 23, 2004 3:07 pm</p><hr />

Not trying to  hijack this tread, but I'm with Disch on this one, Java over C# any day.  People should develop on whatever platform they want, with whatever langauge they want.  But they should consider the hoops they will make their end users jump through to use their product before they choose.  Personally, running anything on C# would require a significant amount of effort for me, as I refuse to run Microsoft based systems.  C# on linux isn't exactly perfect, but is workable.  But if someone wants to release something on C# they should consider users like me (and I know there aren't that many) as a non-viable market for their product.<br />&lt;/rant&gt;<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=29">teaguecl</a> — Tue Nov 23, 2004 2:58 pm</p><hr />

Go to the Games Sources section to get the disassembler and go the aNESe page to get the emulator, which can be used to generate files containing label info (files are named as "Addresses.log"). The disassembler should be able to handle a lot of the Mapper 0, 3 games without the help of aNESe, but if you'd like to disassemble a different game (1, 7) you gotta use the data retrieved by the emulator.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=22">Hyde</a> — Tue Nov 23, 2004 2:11 pm</p><hr />

Most I've found suffer from the following idiocies:<br /><br />* Expect specific binary sizes (i.e. 32K or 16K)<br />* Expect NES images (i.e. full game images with iNES header)<br />* Do not allow you to specify a src address offset (i.e. $E000 vs. the usual $8000 or $C000)<br />* Cannot disassemble to code that is easily re-assembled (i.e. without address labels / opcodes+operand bytes)<br />* Do not support lowercase mneumonics (i.e. all opcodes in uppercase)<br />* Do no form of proper code tracing (NESRev does this by implementing a small emulator-like pre-pass which generates pretty clean code)<br />* For those which insert inline comments for NES PPU registers / etc., do not allow you to disable this behaviour<br />* Do not include binaries for *IX platforms (or do not include source); I consider this a minor issue, though<br /><br />If you look at all of the 6502 disassemblers out there, you won't find any which encompass all of the above -- or even HALF of the above.<br /><br />Pretty amazing, if you ask me.  I always have such a hard time understanding why video game consoles **never** have decent public tools for them.  In the case of the NES, tools today are (generally) in the same condition they were 10 years ago.  There are some CHR-oriented tools which finally came out that suffice (YYChr, for example), but for code work, nothing has changed.<br /><br />In this case, I'm starting to wonder if some of the Atari 2600 6502 disassemblers would suffice instead...<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3">koitsu</a> — Mon Nov 22, 2004 2:19 pm</p><hr />
