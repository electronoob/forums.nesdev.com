<br />
<br />- As I said before, it shouldn't be MegaMan Zero 1-likes of "one hit kills". An energy bar with refills would improve the replay value. Heh, don't take this as the "easy mode" in MM10. ^_^;;

<br />
<br />Ditto. I've taken to playing on easy mode, mainly because most of the difficulty (for me, so far, anyway) seems to be navigational hazards rather than enemies that *need* to be eliminated (like the room before getting the jump height enhancement). 
<br />
<br />... Or it could just be my general lack of coordination  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_redface.gif" alt=":oops:" title="Embarassed" />

<br />
<br />Fun fact, you can take bits and pieces from one password and glue them onto another password.  This means you can change an Easy Mode password into a Normal Mode password and vice versa, or even get the Damage Boost item without being pink.  The password system for this game is about as secure as Megaman 3's.
<br />
<br />For instance, I got this password: FEGBDJYM
<br />And I have another Easy Mode password: EEGWNJTU
<br />
<br />You can make a derived password: <strong>E</strong>EGB<strong>N</strong>JYM  which is equivalent to the first password, but you are on easy mode and have the damage boost.

<br />I played it over and over again just to enjoy the levels and game play and my imagination went crazy on what could possibly lie beyond the laser beams in Quick Man's Stage that were so difficult to overcome.
<br />
<br />That said, I'm glad BK is as hard as it is. Can't wait to play it. Still waiting for my copy to arrive.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />So here's a self-important review.  This will be spoiler free for the most part, I'll let you know when a spoiler comes up.  It's an instant classic, probably on par with "second-tier" classics like Contra and Castlevania I in terms of player involvement, challenge and masochism.  The format makes each new room interesting to look at, to see the layout and what hazards it contains.
<br />
<br />The good thing about one hit death is no grinding.  It's just you and the hazards with no lucky save.  Now that I've beaten it I'll probably go through it every so often.  
<br />
<br /><strong>Now come the spoilers</strong>
<br />
<br />...
<br />
<br />It was cool how the final stage was a greatest hits package of all the hazards.  Even if losing the player his inventory was a dick move, it's made up for in the order you get it back, forcing the player to try new techniques since you've never had double jump without the feather before.  
<br />
<br />I was a little disappointed at how getting the 4th key only gets you an extended ending.  Was hoping for another boss or something.
<br />
<br />Also, as expected, the disappearing spikes were my least favorite part, for the same reason I don't like paddle games: it forces the player into arbitrary downtime.  At least with disappearing blocks you're razor focused on the next move.  But you only put them in like 7 or 8 rooms so it's not a big deal.
<br />
<br />The bosses were knuckle dusters, especially Cleo, Amethyst Angel and Zedd.  First you die in two seconds, then you last a little longer, then you win.  Fighting them and the final boss is almost like a meditation exercise (I got lucky with Cleo since it didn't use that falling star attack).
