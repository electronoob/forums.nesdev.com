He poops alot.  Thank you all for your kind words.  Later tonight I will create his shell account on my home server - although he probably won't use it for a few years.

It shows me that there are still good people in some of the few good places on the internet that haven't changed.<br /><br />Is Zeke short for Ezekiel?  I like that name too. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />  Many hebraic names are very powerful and pretty.  Keeping the &quot;el&quot; on Ezekiel refers to him being &quot;of God.&quot;  Religion and subscribed belief systems aside, I wish and pray the safety and health for your child.<br /><br />Autism is something that many logical thinking partners have been facing in the past two decades; as some of the highest rates of autism come from &quot;silicon valley-like&quot; bedroom communities.  It also can happen from taking specific antibiotics in the early development stages.  Signs of autism are not apparent until the end of the first year and the beginning of the second.  Language development and normal cognition may seem to progress normally until around that time.  I mention this because I work with autistic individuals and know how common it has become.  Even if it does, I can tell you that even though these individuals may be entirely too much to handle by their parents' lives and standards, I love them as my own.  I currently take care of 7 individuals.  I pray that your child develops without the complications of autism and is able to succeed in their personal goals.<br /><br />I send love to you three and your family.<br /><br />P.S.  Haven't seen you on IRC in a while. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />

He said his first word (&quot;momomomaa&quot;) at age 7 months; now he says quite a lot!  He is a handful and very smart.  He has defeated most of the child safety locks on cabinets and doors.  Last month I had to mount the TV high up on the wall to keep him from touching it.  He can occasionally count to 4.  Only a few more years until I introduce Zeke to 6502 assembly language.<br /><br />If I am not traveling on business, I'll bring Zeke to the 2014 MGC on Sunday (April 12).<br /><br />Zeke will be joined by a kid sister in mid July of this summer!  Jayme is pregnant and we're going to have a daughter!  I am so excited.  I'll have a complete set.  Now I just need to go get neutered.
