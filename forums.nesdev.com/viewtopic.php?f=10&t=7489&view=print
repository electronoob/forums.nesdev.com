		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />i just started reading a bunch of the forums on this site and realized tht the newbies ussually write a little intro about themselve (I DIDNT DO THIS) so here it goes:
<br />
<br />i live in canada and am only in gr 8. i recently started getting very addicted to old video games (particularly rpgs) ever since i played FF1 for the nes <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /> i quickly began trying to ref as much hockey as i could to get money (my very sad low income...) and shortly after would buy nintendo with it ! i now have like 11 consoles +160 games and 2 tvs in my room... my favourite game is earthbound <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /> which i logged +60 hours on in like 2 weeks even with school. i then purchased earthbound "zero" for the nes from gamereproductions.com and shortly after that got an idea. to reproduct my own cart. I thot tht no other hobbiest had done this (VERY overoptimistic) and then while googling every possible combination of words read a bunch of stuff about it and found this site fairly often... i decided that this community seemed very helpful kind and i signed up! so here i am now writing a rlly long and boring intro...
<br />
<br />anyways getting back to the point, i am stilll waiting to buy a eprom programmer (now know to get a usb one, thx for the info guys <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /> ) and am waiting for some other stuff like a gamebit driver and stuff. so in the meantime i thought i would eventually want to make my own game! i have looked up a bunch of 6502 programming docs and read them all (24/7, staying up at night, sneaking it during class etc (plz dont tell my mom) haha) and still dont rlly understand it. i cant reallly get anything to work unless using a step by step tutorial. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" alt=":(" title="Sad" />
<br />
<br />i have no programming experience and very little rom hacking experience (thx to nes mods tuts for those ) just like chaging the graght using TLP and chging the txt and a bit of pallette stuff.
<br />
<br />For my first game all i want in a sprite (dont care wut it looks like, a circle?) tht i can move around with the Dpad and a background tht has a design (dont really care wut it looks like just something ) does this seem doable? i would like to make sure all my programming would be able to work on an actual NES if i ever decide to do that <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />
<br />
<br />HOLY COWW THT WAS LONG! thanks <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />

However, I must warn you, if you think that placing a sprite is as easy as "PutSprite(sprite.png,x-coordinate,y-coordinate)"... you will be mistaken.
<br />
<br />Sadly, I have not found any better tutorials, as they're either written by newbies a la GbaGuy, explain lots of complex stuff at once, or don't start from the basics at all.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />One day, (probably after my current project is finished) I think I will write a tutorial. But it will probably end up being in the category of "explains too much technical stuff at once." I always seem to do that to the poor people I try to help  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" alt=":(" title="Sad" /> 
<br />
<br />Anyway, welcome. Glad to see another Mother/Earthbound fan around.

Using addition, subtraction and logical? would you mind explaining the logical? and what they do? thanks <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I was 15 when I started learning how to program, I started out taking source code to a demo that was available and started changing stuff in it.  You could try that with some of the sources on the main page of the site, that helps with the first battle - just getting the assembler to produce a properly formatted ROM.  I first hacked the Mouser ROM (not recommended these days), and also learned from SnowBro's and Chris Covell's stuff.
<br />
<br />The accumulator is the brain of the 6502, pretty much.  Adds, subs, logical only works on A.  That's where the result ends up, anyways.
<br />
<br />The logical stuff btw is AND, OR, and EOR (exclusive or).  Essentially, you use those operations to clear, set, or invert individual bits (respective in that order).  <a href="http://nesdev.com/nesguide.zip" class="postlink">This doc</a> has some examples of using the AND, ORA, EOR, and other instructions.
<br /><a href="http://nesdev.com/NESprgmn.txt" class="postlink">Here</a> is another tutorial that's on this site.
<br />
<br />Doing stuff with the screen using the PPU is a little different - it's a whole separate processor.  From the CPU, you write to the video memory through a port (the $2006-$2007 registers listed in the docs).

<br />
<br />Yes, the vast majority of pieces of information seen on the screen have passed through the accumulator. For example, moving an object across the screen involves loading the current position from a variable in memory into the accumulator, adding its velocity from another variable, and storing the position back to the first variable.

<br />
<br />RAM=Array of variables the processor stores and reads.
<br />
<br />A register=Byte/Variable that the processor is editing and using for math at that moment.
<br />
<br />X/Y are pointers to the RAM somethimes for some operations, and I even use them for scratchpad sometimes (TAY and TAX instructions if I only need to use one byte of RAM and not make some scratchpad for it or even use the stack other times)
<br />
<br />
<br />Hope that helps some. If you want, message me I'll help you work on a couple examples of how to do stuff on the NES.
