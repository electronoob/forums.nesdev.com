That's 2 tracks.<br />I then took away any instruments which were similar to others. It fell within the limit and I was able to compile it!<br /><br />HOWEVER the ROM crashes when I test it out in NEStopia or NCEUX.<br />It says that the CPU jammed?<br /><br />So there's obviously something wrong but I atleast know that the ROM can be compiled .
