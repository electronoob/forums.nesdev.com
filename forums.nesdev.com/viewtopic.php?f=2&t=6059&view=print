<br /><img src="http://i50.tinypic.com/302w5di.png" alt="Image" />
<br />If I programmed a game, I would make them stand like this:
<br /><img src="http://i50.tinypic.com/5n828z.png" alt="Image" />
<br />This would look more realistic and it would be more logic since in this case, the character's Y location would be a value of (n * 16) and not (n * 16 + 1). But only in a few NES games does the characters stand above the ground. In most games, they stand inside the ground. Why is this the case?

<br />Most NES games have a one pixel border around characters and/or on the ground anyway, or have a "slanted" floor where they can place characters on any plane they want (River City Ransom, Battletoads, Prince of Persia).  Even if the intent is for a perfectly horizontal view, one or two pixels do not ruin the game.

Atari 2600, NES, and the vast majority of Super NES and Genesis games run at 240p, which on a decent set will show dark spaces between the scanlines. (The "scanlines" effect in popular emulators simulates this.) If you can see the spaces between scanlines on a CRT, then you can certainly see whether Mario's feet are above or in a block, and you can definitely see whether small Mario's head grazes the block above him.<br /><br />You might be confusing CRT blur with Game Boy LCD motion blur, where games could actually get away with updating OAM late *cough*Wario Land*cough* until Super Game Boy and Game Boy Pocket came out.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">Plus, it's not a gigantic problem by any means, so I wouldn't be surprised if it was just a trivial matter to most devs, i.e. not high up on the priority list to fix.</div>
<br />You're right that not all game designs depend on strict alignment between background and sprites because the collision isn't pixel-precise anyway.

<br />What does Wario Land do wrong ? I'm fan of this game recently and I think it has some of the best graphics on the monochrome Gameboy I don't see any glitches (I use my GBA SP to play it).
<br />
<br />And I'm pretty sure the Game Boy Pocket has terrible motion blur. I never use it because for most games it's impossible to see what is going on so much it's terrible. However the GBC and GBA has MUCH less motion blur, and the SGB of course doesn't have any (as it's connected to a TV).

<br />Updates to the background position register are out of sync from updates to OAM, that's all. Run a Super Game Boy or a Game Boy Player (with motion blur set to "sharp") into a VCR, press record, and hit some blocks to expose power-ups, and walk back and forth under the power-ups. Once you've done this a few times, go back and play the tape, single-stepping through the section where you walked back and forth and paying attention to alignment between the powerups and the blocks they came out of. If you don't see it, the problem might have been fixed for the (E) release.

<br />If you program your sprite drawing routine for it, it could be faster to simply assume a sprite is at a nice even y value (when not in the air) rather than needing to subract 1 every single frame.

<br />
<br />I thought Dr. Mario did that on purpose so you could clearly see when the piece has "set".
<br />
<br />I always hated when I thought a piece has set and I try moving the next upcoming piece, only to find the piece didn't set yet and I just moved it and screwed myself.  Happens to me ALL THE TIME in Tetris, but never happens to me in Dr. Mario.
