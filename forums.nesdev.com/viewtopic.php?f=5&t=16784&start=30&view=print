I honestly don’t think so.<br /><br />It adds some nuance (which of i’m guilty of reducing), that’s all.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I try to distance myself from the horribly aggressive feminist movement that's been growing other the last few years, because I feel exactly like Pokum, that it's become extremely loud and so obsessed with attacking everything that anyone standing outside of it will have a hard time taking it seriously.<br /><br />And that's sort of sad, because there <strong>is</strong> an issue, and it needs focus. I just don't feel like the correct way to approach it is to antagonize people who don't understand it. I try to remain neutral so I can recognize an issue when there is one, instead of actively looking for one. It tends to get me enemies in both camps, but I really value objectivity in a sensitive matter such as this.<br /><br />On the subject of &quot;Super Princess Peach&quot;, I don't feel like there's a reason to demonize it for doing anything horrible. The developers didn't mean anything bad with it, and I don't feel that the game itself could possibly cause any harm to anyone, directly or indirectly - it's merely the cause of a society that already has some odd priorities. But I think you should still be able to recognise that the concept is ridiculously stupid and unfair towards her character, without making too much of a fuss about it. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Yeah, just to be perfectly clear, i don’t think anyone intentionally villanously aimed for what i identified as a misogynist expression while playing. It does’t aim to represent peach caricature-like. It’s a game about expressing emotions (like i also said). It’s just that against the issue-ridden backdrop of womens’ history (which is also more or less visible depending on if you have experience of life as a woman or not and what that entails) it comes off as something entirely else. <br /><br />Any backdrop is always going to embed itself into a piece of work everytime someone decodes it, and i think that’s a thing designers ought to at least discuss.<br /><br />It was never my purpose to lash out at the games'/its designers’ intentions, merely to express how the game felt like and why social structure and history plays a part in that.<br /><br />Edit:<br />Given that gender has become one of the most politically loaded questions of today (a bit like it was ~100 years ago, too), it might not have been the best start to joke about the a fictional design meeting like i did. I kind of regret that.

If this means that all Links are the reincarnation of the same spirit or not is hard to tell, and it also gets confusing if you consider Wolf Link being taught by the spirit of the Hero of Time, despite they are both being the same spirit of the hero if that is true.<br /><br />Another thing I always thought was funny is that the descendants of the seven sages are all humanoid while the original sages included Goron and Zora. I guess it's possible that someone in their bloodlines may have married Hylians or other humanoids at some point though.

There has been a continuity right from the start:<br /><br />&quot;Zelda II&quot; is a direct sequel to &quot;Zelda I&quot; anyway.<br /><br />&quot;A Link to the Past&quot; might look like just an alternate universe or retelling of the original game, but the box makes it clear that it's a prequel to the NES games:<br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">Venture back to Hyrule and an age of magic and heroes. <span style="text-decoration: underline">The predecessors of Link and Zelda</span> face monsters on the march when a menacing magician takes over the kingdom.</div><br />&quot;Link's Awakening&quot; is a sequel to ALttP.<br /><br />And when &quot;Ocarina of Time&quot; came out, they emphasized that this is the first game in the series. So, again, not just an alternate take on the original NES and SNES games.<br /><br />The &quot;Zelda&quot; games were always intended to be an ongoing series. It was never about retelling or updating the same story, like with the movies &quot;Spider Man&quot;, &quot;The Amazing Spider Man&quot; and &quot;Spider Man - Homecoming&quot;. Or like Grimm's &quot;Snow White&quot; and Disney's &quot;Snow White&quot;.<br /><br />It was always a connected series, only playing centuries apart, but the same universe and continuity. Just like &quot;The Silmarillion&quot;, &quot;The Hobbit&quot; and &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Possibly, although it may be possible that there where disagreements within Nintendo during development of AlttP. But yes after that it's clear that there's a continuity: Ocarina was definitely designed after the backstory written in AlttP's manual, Link's Awakening is a direct sequel to AlttP and Oracle games are designed to take place in between ALttP and LA and so on. On the other hand I don't think Nintendo cares too much about consistency with certain things. For example they like to redesign the map with no explanation as why Hyrule's geography changes so much. Of course it wouldn't feel like a new game if they had used the same exact map in all games since Zelda 1. The world has to be redesigned for the same reason that levels in Mario games have to be new in every game despite them taking place in the same world.
