Nintendo's way of harassing Color Dreams was to revise the NES mainboard to prevent their CIC defeat.  There are multiple revisions, and IIRC, I've heard one of them prevents all the CIC defeats.  I can't remember if it was from Color Dreams, but seem to remember seeing an instruction sheet about cutting pin 4 on the lockout chip that was with an unlicensed cart.<br /><br />Game Genie was mentioned, and though Nintendo sued, they completely lost that case.  Since they prevented it from being released for a time, you can bet Nintendo ended up paying in damages for the production of quite a few Game Genies.<br /><br />On a related note, I always thought the text on this game box was hilarious.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=10">Memblers</a> — Mon Jan 12, 2015 4:38 pm</p><hr />

If the facts in your case are not substantially different from the facts in another case, a lot of things can be dealt with in summary judgment, which is a lot cheaper than a trial.
