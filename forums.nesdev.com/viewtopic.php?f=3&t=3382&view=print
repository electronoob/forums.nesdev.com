<br />For those that don't know about the project: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://bootgod.dyndns.org:7777">http://bootgod.dyndns.org:7777</a><!-- m -->
<br />
<br />As a convention, I've been using the company that produced the cart as the the prefix in the UNIF name. I think it makes more sense this way. Even with redundant things like NROM carts, rather than calling them all NES or HVC-NROM, I've been using BANDAI-NROM, IREM-NROM, SUNSOFT-NROM, etc. I may go back and change the unlicensed games in the DB to use the same convention.
<br />
<br />Also, I'm not really meaning to cover corrections to existing dumps or new dumps in this post. It's more so for emulator authors and whatnot.
<br />
<br />Nintendo:
<br />---------
<br />Family Basic (pcb: FB-N-128-02) Probably shouldn't be assigned as m0 (NROM), it has 2K battery-backed WRAM, suggest UNIF name HVC-FAMILYBASIC. On a side note, I wasn't able to dump this cart with CopyNES, I had to pull the ROMs (all 3 of them <img src="./images/smilies/icon_neutral.gif" alt=":|" title="Neutral" />) and read them manually. I'm thinking the cart won't boot unless the famicom keyboard is hooked up (I don't have one)
<br />
<br />
<br />Bandai:
<br />-------
<br />Bandai carts assigned as m16 (they all seem to be able to co-exist as the same mapper number)
<br />BANDAI-FCG-1, uses $7FFx for registers
<br />BANDAI-FCG-2, uses $600x for registers
<br />BANDAI-LZ93D50 (w/ 24C02 EEPROM), uses $800x for registers
<br />
<br />
<br />Bandai carts assigned as m70 (Nestopia now wants to use 152?)
<br />BANDAI-LS161/161/32
<br />
<br />
<br />Sunsoft:
<br />--------
<br />Sunsoft carts assigned as m69
<br />SUNSOFT-FME-7
<br />
<br />Sunsoft carts assigned as m184
<br />SUNSOFT-1
<br />
<br />
<br />Jaleco:
<br />-------
<br />Jaleco carts assigned as m87
<br />JALECO-LS139/74
<br />
<br />Nestopia currently emulates m87 incorrectly. This hardware handles up to 32K VROM, not just 16K. Both bit 0 &amp; 1 of $6000 are used. They wired the mapper up goofy so that bit 0 controls CHR A14 and bit 1 controls CHR A13. Nestopia currently is using m101 for the 32K ROMs, they should be reassigned back to 87 and 101 should be scrapped. Urusei Yatsura - Lum no Wedding Bell is the only 32K CHR I'm aware of, and the existing dump is bad (inner 2 CHR banks are swapped)
<br />
<br />
<br />Jaleco carts assigned as m140 (some emu's want to use 66, wrongly)
<br />JALECO-LS139/174
<br />
<br />Mississippi Satsujin Jiken - Murder on the Mississippi is the only game I have that uses this board. It functions almost identically to GNROM (m66) but it uses $6000 for it's register (NOT $8000). Both existing dumps of this game are bad. One of them has been mapper hacked to work with m66 (all writes to $6000 are replaced with $8000) The other has a completely different upper 64K PRG.
<br />
<br />
<br />Jaleco carts assigned as m86
<br />JALECO-LS139/174/174
<br />
<br />Moero!! Pro Yakyuu uses this board, has an onboard uPD7756C ADPCM speech synth chip with a 256kb ROM embedded with the digital sample data stored, but no apparent way to dump this data (damn!!)
<br />
<br />
<br />Jaleco carts assigned as m2
<br />JALECO-UOROM
<br />
<br />Maniac Mansion uses this, seems to be functionally identical to NES/HVC-UOROM
<br />
<br />
<br />Jaleco carts assigned as m75
<br />JALECO-D65005C075 (this may change)
<br />
<br />Seems to work identical to the Konami VRC1
<br />
<br />
<br />Taito:
<br />------
<br />Taito carts assigned as m33
<br />TAITO-TC0190FMC
<br />
<br />
<br />Taito carts assigned as m87
<br />TAITO-LS139/74
<br />
<br />The existing Kage no Densetsu dump is incorrectly set as m3 (CNROM). This board works exactly like the Jaleco ones, right down to the goofy mapper connections.
<br />
<br />
<br />Taito carts assigned as m80
<br />TAITO-X1-005
<br />
<br />
<br />Taito carts assigned as m3
<br />TAITO-CNROM
<br />
<br />Functions identical to NES/HVC-CNROM. Note that this particular cart required that I set the proper "key" before dumping. Refer to this <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://nesdev.com/bbs/viewtopic.php?t=2797">http://nesdev.com/bbs/viewtopic.php?t=2797</a><!-- m --> for more info on that (and why mapper 185 should go away)
<br />
<br />Konami:
<br />-------
<br />Konami carts assigned as m87
<br />KONAMI-LS139/74
<br />
<br />Setup just like the Jaleco and Taito boards. I don't really understand why the hell all these companies wired this mapper like they did.
<br />
<br />
<br />Konami carts assigned as m2 and m3
<br />KONAMI-UNROM and KONAMI-CNROM respectively. They work just like the NES/HVC counterparts.
<br />
<br />
<br />Konami VRC carts:
<br />KONAMI-VRC-1  = m75
<br />KONAMI-VRC-2A - m22
<br />KONAMI-VRC-2B = m23
<br />KONAMI-VRC-3  = m73
<br />KONAMI-VRC-4A = m21
<br />KONAMI-VRC-4B = m25
<br />KONAMI-VRC-4C = m21
<br />KONAMI-VRC-4D = m25
<br />KONAMI-VRC-4E = m23
<br />KONAMI-VRC-6A = m24
<br />KONAMI-VRC-6B = m26
<br />KONAMI-VRC-7  = m85
<br />
<br />Bleh. What a god damn mess! The only difference in the between the letter variations is a couple of the address lines are connected differently (WHY!?) If the INES 2.0 spec ever gets off the ground, it sure would be nice to see each VRC version have just one mapper number, and then have the sub-mapper field explain the address line connections! BTW, I got the variation lettering from Martin Korth's EveryNES tech docs.
<br />
<br />
<br />Namco:
<br />------
<br />Namco carts assigned as m4 (but probably shouldn't be)
<br />NAMCO-108
<br />NAMCO-109
<br />NAMCO-118
<br />
<br />These chips all seem to function the same and are interchangable. I really don't like how these are all dumped into m4 (like so many others too). I think they function differently enough to warrant their own mapper number.
<br />
<br />
<br />Namco carts assigned as m88
<br />NAMCO-118+LS32
<br />
<br />I currently only have one cart that uses this mapper (Quinty), but it's probably safe to assume a 108 or 109 could also be used in this combo. The LS32 allows the cart to use 128K instead of a max of 64. Although it works kind of oddly, the lower 64K can only be mapped to PPU $0000 and the upper 64K can only be mapped to PPU $1000.
<br />
<br />
<br />Namco carts assigned as m19
<br />NAMCO-106
<br />
<br />Every cart I have that uses this mapper is epoxy glob boards, so I don't actually know that the mapper is a "106". A number of these games have batteries but no WRAM! I suspect they may be saving game data to the internal VRAM on the 106. Go here <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://nesdev.com/bbs/viewtopic.php?t=3377">http://nesdev.com/bbs/viewtopic.php?t=3377</a><!-- m --> for more info (or more questions actually) about the 106
<br />
<br />Nestopia wants to use m210 for some of these, what is the deal with that?
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />Well that is it for the first batch of Famicom games, but many many more are on the way!

<br />lol, no I've figured out how to open everything I've come across so far without damaging them. There have been a few victims in the learning process though <img src="./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" /> The old-style Namco carts were by far the hardest to open. Some of the Taito carts were difficult, but the rest are quite easy once you get the hang of it.

<br />
<br />EDIT :
<br />About the conventions, I see no reason why NES 3rd party games should have the same UNIF name as the standard ones, and the 3rd party Famicom games should have a different UNIF name.
<br />And the UNIF name is supposed to be strictly the PCB name (without the revision number), so unless a PCB is effectively called "SUNSOFT-NROM", this means nothing more than "HVC-NROM".
<br />
<br />I'd like to point that the UNIF format is incomplete on the fact it relies on board name to run the game, but the same board can have different uses : the example are those special CNROM games with diodes, or UNROM games that uses a 7408 instead of a 7432 (there isn't many, but those are still UNROM).
<br />It'd be better to have convention in a software standpoint instead of a hardware one, but that doesn't make things much easier. There is pretty much a lot of ways you can get a board work for the iNES equivalent of "Mapper 3" : Just standard CNROM (with a 74161), the same with more latched bits adressing CHR, allowing larger CHRROMs, pair up two 74161 or having a 74377 instead to latch more bits and have even larger CHRROM, have a smaller 7474 latch that would be controlled by another logic gate to be adressed (that could be the same part as a logic gate avoiding bus conflicts), or even a CNROM-like board with 4-screen mirroring, and those would all be the exact same in a software viewpoint, but very different in a hardware viewpoint.
<br />
<br />As another example of this : There is 3 version of Gauntlet in a hardware standpoint : One using a Tengen board with a Tengen MMC3-like chip, one using a Nintendo board with a Namco MMC3-like chip, and one using a Nintendo board with the Real MMC3, and uses a half of a 8kb SRAM chip for 4-screens, instead of using 7400+2kb SRAM like the other two versions. Those 3 are very different from a hardware standpoint, but exactly the same in a software standpoint, and I think all 3 should be considered equivalent memory mapping.
