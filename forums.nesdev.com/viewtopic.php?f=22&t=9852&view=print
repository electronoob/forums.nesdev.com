It's a Legend of Zelda type game, as you can probably tell.<br /><br /><img src="http://imageshack.us/a/img833/5679/knil0.png" alt="Image" /><img src="http://imageshack.us/a/img547/1233/knil1.png" alt="Image" /><img src="http://imageshack.us/a/img841/8554/knil2.png" alt="Image" /><br /><br /><img src="http://imageshack.us/a/img132/7623/knil3.png" alt="Image" /><img src="http://imageshack.us/a/img585/8660/knil4.png" alt="Image" /><img src="http://imageshack.us/a/img405/4678/knil5.png" alt="Image" /><br /><br /><img src="http://imageshack.us/a/img26/8531/knil6.png" alt="Image" /><img src="http://imageshack.us/a/img62/3509/knil7.png" alt="Image" /><br /><br />I've got some scrolling issues to fix, otherwise I would have done a video. The game currently targets FME-7, but could probably work on an MMC3. Palette updates after the status bar (my graphics/palettes do a poor job of showing this) and the textboxes necessitate the use of a mapper with an IRQ.<br /><br />The core of the engine is done. What's left is mostly just polishing things like collision, music/sfx driver, and whatever needs to be added for scripting specific events. The actual content of the game is sitting around 10%. Now I have to sit down and design a game.  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" />

It will also have fewer RPG elements than Zelda (in a good way of course - i.e. you wont be completely lost when you start your game).

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Cool! This is exciting! Thanks for making a post about it. It's about time some Zelda derivative homebrews start coming out. I look forward to seeing this progress. *edit* The little blue guy reminds me of a blue strongbad.<br /><br />*edit* Textboxes are an interesting topic. In my project, I use a bit of sleight of hand. I align the scrolling to an 8x8 pixel boundary, then draw the textbox. Sprites also get aligned to 8 pixel boundaries so that they appear to be clipped by the textbox. If you're careful, the farthest any sprite will have to move to become aligned to your text box is 4 pixels---not very noticeable. Crystalis allowed ugly gaps to show against their sprites for textboxes. So, while still not perfect, it's a good compromise. It is a nice way to display a textbox without any raster effects.

Speaking for myself, I wouldn't feel competitive with anyone even if they were making something similar. Every game will be unique and have something worthwhile I think.<br /><br />Also, I think there is perhaps a natural time of life when people start to get this urgent need to finish old dreams. My own games were things I tried and failed to complete when I was a teenager/early 20's, it is probably a matter of time before you go through the same &quot;resolution.&quot;  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />

Most of the work I've been doing is on the overworld and fleshing out the weapons and upgrades. The overworld is actually quite large, I may need to scale it back.<br /><br />Now, on to my question. The game allows for sequence breaking. If you get the fire weapon (a lighter for now) and head into the mountains, you can end up in the situation like this:<br /><br /><a href="http://imageshack.us/photo/my-images/35/ddd8.png/" class="postlink"><img src="http://imageshack.us/a/img35/8373/ddd8.png" alt="Image" /></a><br /><br />Normally, you have two ways out of this. If you have the jump upgrade, you can jump the gap if its less then ~18 pixels. There is also an ice weapon (unnamed) that can refreeze the water. The game allows for saving at any time, but you will be sent to a &quot;restart&quot; point when you load up the file again (like LoZ:ALttP). This will prevent you from losing progress if you get stuck. The inventory screen also has a RESET option.<br /><br />Personally, I don't like the idea of players getting &quot;stuck&quot; and forced to reset the game. It reminds me of those Mario hacks that force you to die if you go the wrong way. It seems like bad design. Am I being overly critical? Thoughts?
