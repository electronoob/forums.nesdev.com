If you really wanted to minimize visual scrolling glitches, I'd recommend to go with vertical mirroring (like Milon's Secret Castle).<br /><br />Maybe it's because my locale uses NTSC, but the topmost and bottommost scanlines are *always* off screen (as much as 8px on each edge, too!), whereas the leftmost and rightmost column of tiles is usually visible. Therefore, I could conclude that it'd be situationally easier to mask vertical glitches than horizontal.<br /><br />Also, setting the scrolling mid-frame (i.e., after a forced vblank) isn't tricky at all, you just write $2006, $2005, $2005, $2006. You'll need to offset the Y scrolling to compensate, but that's a very trivial matter, and even though that last write to $2006 requires a little bit of bit shifting to calculate, that can all be calculated before the screen split.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=21">Drag</a> — Wed Jun 02, 2010 7:20 pm</p><hr />

I think everyone has different priorities when making games. Several of the old commercial games have different types of visual glitches, because the programmers had different priorities.<br /><br />I absolutely hate scrolling glitches, so I'll do whatever I can to prevent them. Sprites popping at the left side of the screen don't bother me that much... it bothers me much less than hiding a perfectly good column of the level map, so I don't do that.<br /><br />I think some of you are not respecting other peoples' opinions when you state as fact that a certain thing is stupid or silly, just because they differ from your own.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=95">tokumaru</a> — Wed Jun 02, 2010 8:04 am</p><hr />

Today I just made a new macro combining the animate macro and the build_metasprite macro into an oam_animation macro, and another macro combining the animate macro, the dma_sprite_graphics macro and the build_metasprite macro into a dma_animation macro.<br /><br />It sucks that I can't freely use animation without relying on several different methods/tricks to get the best use of animation out of the Snes.  Yes it is possible to pull off 60 fps animation, but you need to design levels in certain ways so that one enemy's animation doesn't interfere with another enemy.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=4383">psycopathicteen</a> — Tue Jun 01, 2010 3:22 pm</p><hr />

The fact that the height of the name tables is not a power of two causes the vertical hardware scroll to be desynchronized with the software scroll (camera), requires annoying boundary checks, makes attribute updates harder, and so on. I think I have enough reasons not to like that particular aspect of the NES. But since I like the NES as a whole, I can live with that. And once the code to deal with that is written, it's no longer an issue.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"><br />And on the countrary of what you said, it looks "better" if an enemy or object entierely pop up at once than if individual tiles of it pop up every 8 pixels.<br /></div><br />Please don't state your opinion as fact. I much prefer individual sprites popping up rather than whole objects. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V5Uqd5-p2Y" class="postlink">Here's a video of a game where whole objects pop in</a>. Do you really like that? I think (and this is my opinion, not a fact) it looks stupid.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=95">tokumaru</a> — Tue Jun 01, 2010 10:21 am</p><hr />
