It also says &quot;INFINITE NES LIVES&quot; on it, and I know he's a member here. It's kind of cool that someone semi-famous like James would be playing a game I presume was made by people here.<br /><br />Anyway, this is the video.

It's essentially a diagonal version of the &quot;portable ladder&quot; mechanic from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rod_Land" class="postlink"><em>Rod Land</em></a>. In these games, the player moves primarily in a straight line along the rope.<br /><br /><em>Pitfall!</em>, <em>Bionic Commando</em>, the <em>Spider-Man</em> games, and the <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/viewtopic.php?f=22&amp;t=9856" class="postlink"><em>Wrecking Ball Boy</em> tech demo</a> use a different paradigm in which the player moves perpendicularly to the swinging rope.

(James did vaguely.) What drives me up a wall though is when they get information wrong and they're probably not to sure but they present it as fact. I know they probably don't do this on purpose and they seem like nice people, so I'll let it slide. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_lol.gif" alt=":lol:" title="Laughing" />

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Maybe I'm alone in my stance, but they're just three gamers. They're not programmers, they're not hardcore NES tech enthusiasts, I wouldn't expect them to know the difference between a &quot;hack&quot; and a &quot;homebrew&quot;, and I don't think the majority of their fanbase knows or cares either. It reminded them of Bionic Commando (as the designer seems to have <em>intended</em>), and if anyone likes that style of platformer, then they'd see this and might check it out. Besides, they didn't mean to downplay the game, and they even mention in the video description that there are &quot;16 different <span style="text-decoration: underline">homebrew</span> titles such as the iconic Streemerz&quot; (emphasis is mine). If the description didn't say that before, it says it now, meaning James or Mike noticed and updated it.<br /><br />It's just really weird to get upset over our niche terminology that most people wouldn't know or care about.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />James and Mike (and guests) videos are just a couple of gamers talking about games while playing them.  They do not have a script and their memories are often nostalgic, so I expect the occasional error.  They cannot be expected to be omniscient when hanging out and having fun.  When James wants to do a review of a game or a movie, he is pretty accurate (his Dracula commentary is worth listening to).  James still captures composite video from his systems, does not generally use emulators or reproduction games and still has wood paneling in his basement even though he can afford wainscoating.

It's their experience, what's wrong with them having fun on their own terms? (...as long as they aren't cheating dishonestly, e.g. in a competitive game, but dishonesty is a separate issue.) The whole point of games is that you can choose what you want to do; if there's no choice, it's not a game. This stuff is a natural extension of that, and actually as a developer I'd generally be excited to see someone trying things with my game that I didn't even intend to be possible.
