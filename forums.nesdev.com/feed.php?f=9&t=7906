My point about Bill and Lance having jaundice is that if there's one palette entry which looks wrong (excessively bright/over-washed) then there are probably others.<br /><br />Is it possible for the OP to use a PowerPak to load one of the palette display ROMs blargg or others made -- like <a href="http://nesdev.com/bbs/viewtopic.php?p=10658#10658" class="postlink">this one?</a> -- on both an original (non-modded) console and then on the modded console?  I have a gut feeling the difference is going to be huge.<br /><br />Also, regarding the gobbledegook on the right side of the screen during capture: okay, so your capture card shows some part of HBlank overscan or whatever it's called.  I still think it's weird that the RGB mod somehow causes that to happen while on the non-modded console it doesn't, using the same capture card.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3">koitsu</a> — Sun Jun 26, 2011 10:14 pm</p><hr />

I agree it looks like Bill and Lance have jaundice but during gameplay it looks alright to me.<br /><br />I know I'll sound dumb, but what about using Nestopia ? That way you have :<br />Composite -&gt; Use NTSC filter<br />RGB with right colors -&gt; Use plain bilinear filter<br /><br />And NO bad connector problem, NO save lost problem etc... The only thing the real NES is good at today is to test your soft on it to make sure it works on real hardware.<br /><br />Oh and by the way, does Noha's Ark and Just Breed work with a RGB PPU ? How does transitions to battle in Final Fantasy look ? I just wonder about the color emphasis bits.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=38">Bregalad</a> — Sun Jun 26, 2011 1:03 pm</p><hr />

Wow atleast in the demo video it sound AWFUL. Truely horrendous. Video wise the colors are seriously messed up, more than adjusting the color level of your TV. This is known problem with the RGB PPU being used. Really what would make such a mod worth while would be if someone made a RGB PPU clone that used color palettes identical to the NTSC system, adjusted so they would appear as close as possible to the NTSC look which nearly all games were designed to be viewed in.<br /><br />I do understand the problems with HDTVs and the NES Composite signal being displayed with alot of problems which may be reduced by using S-Video or RGB. But it seems you are just trading one problem for another. Just buy a good quality TV or Monitor that accepts Composite video. The NES looks extremely sharp and clear on my Sony PVM. I see no need for RGB.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=1726">MottZilla</a> — Sun Jun 26, 2011 12:49 pm</p><hr />

Okay for all you haters of the stereo mod I have a solution for you.  I wire both audio channels into my amp.  And I set my amp to "mono".  And everything is once again mono.  I hope this makes you happy so you can stop complaining about it.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">koitsu wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"><br />That said, the *quality* difference of the audio mod in question is quite nice.  It must be using an OPAMP of some kind, and/or some very basic filter circuitry.  I noticed that the PCM "pops" are significantly minimised.  However, those "pops" are actually used by some games for a drum/bass beat, such as in the "underground" areas in Crystalis.<br /></div><br /><br />Yes that's right the bass pops aren't as bold anymore with this mod.  The bass drum in tmnt 2, and final fantasy 3, is less noticable once you do this mod.  And for some strange reason kirbys adventure has 2 songs where you don't clearly hear all the snare drum hits.  Other than that everything else sounds fine.  I'd love to find any suggestions on how to fix this issue.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">koitsu wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"><br />Regarding <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7v7e-bjB13s" class="postlink">the video</a> -- wow, look at the Contra title screen.  Who decided on the RGB conversion palette?  It looks like shit.  Look at the skin colour of Bill and Lance.  Do they have jaundice?  Also, why is there a bunch of screen noise (looks like PPU problems/bugs!) to the right of Bill and Lance's picture on the modded/RGB unit?  It's quite apparent throughout the entire video during gameplay too.  There's another video on Youtube of someone showing off an S-video modded Famicom playing Castlevania 3, and the colours there also look extremely "amplified" (bordering on washed out).  Why would someone put up with this?<br /></div><br /><br />Having colours be a little off doesn't matter when the video quality is extremely clear.  If you're complaining about that row of pixels on the right that is doing random stuff, that doesn't show up on my tv.  My capture card captures a larger range of video than my tv displays.  And a lot of people put up with the amplified colours, infact some of my clients already own a rgb nes so they're fully aware of what everything looks like.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">infiniteneslives wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"><br />If you would have realized this was a universal color code it could have made it a little easier it's really fairly basic knowledge so I'd study up if I were in your shoes:  <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=resistor+color+code&amp;hl=en&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;hs=Bfh&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&amp;prmd=ivns&amp;tbm=isch&amp;tbo=u&amp;source=univ&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=FbIGTu6_Ha7TiAKbjtTXDQ&amp;ved=0CDkQsAQ&amp;biw=1680&amp;bih=917" class="postlink">http://www.google.com/search?q=resistor+color+code&amp;hl=en&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;hs=Bfh&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&amp;prmd=ivns&amp;tbm=isch&amp;tbo=u&amp;source=univ&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=FbIGTu6_Ha7TiAKbjtTXDQ&amp;ved=0CDkQsAQ&amp;biw=1680&amp;bih=917</a><br /><br />They even make apps for you phone too if you have a hard time remembering the rainbow <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /></div><br /><br />Yes I'm aware of that.

If you do this mod and don't like the colours being so bright, then why not turn down the colour strength on your tv.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=4533">Drakon</a> — Sun Jun 26, 2011 6:26 am</p><hr />

It's interesting to see people trying to improve their nes/famicom and see the results. I'm all for seeing what kind of new things people can do!  <br /><br />But, it doesn't me that I would do it personally. My opinion on the Contra video would be a little harsh thought.  Screen quality wise, yes, I do see an improvement except for the color of the title screen (maybe there is a reason behind it, TV screen setting or something).  As for the music, I thought on the other hand that it didn't sound the same anymore. All the drum line done by PCM was missing, filtered out in some way.  In that case, I prefer the original.<br /><br />Going from an RF famicom (crap video/sound) to an AV one was already a big improvement. so in which situation does this hack would be useful? My guess would be on HD tv maybe? I don't have one yet to play around so I cannot say.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3559">Banshaku</a> — Sun Jun 26, 2011 12:42 am</p><hr />

Who decided on the RGB conversion palette?  It looks like shit.  Look at the skin colour of Bill and Lance.  Do they have jaundice?  Also, why is there a bunch of screen noise (looks like PPU problems/bugs!) to the right of Bill and Lance's picture on the modded/RGB unit?  It's quite apparent throughout the entire video during gameplay too.  There's another video on Youtube of someone showing off an S-video modded Famicom playing Castlevania 3, and the colours there also look extremely "amplified" (bordering on washed out).  Why would someone put up with this?<br /></div><br /><br />Even worse to me was how the character doesn't even appear for a few seconds in the beginning of the game.  He's flickering in the unmodded version which is what I'm used to but atleast hes there!<br /><br />I'm guessing the television's colors need to be adjusted because the picture looks really dull compared to what I'm used to.  I think you could get the same end effect if you really wanted it by playing around with TV's color...<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=4832">infiniteneslives</a> — Sat Jun 25, 2011 9:26 pm</p><hr />
