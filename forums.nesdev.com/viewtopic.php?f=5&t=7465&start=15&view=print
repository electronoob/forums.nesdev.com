Anyone up for making some 2GHZ 6502's with some new 256-sprite no-limit sprites? That'd be amazing, the world needs an epic easy-to-progam 2D PPU, haha.  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt=":roll:" title="Rolling Eyes" />

One bad thing is that software would have to put "sprites" on the screen from it, unless it has the bitmapped layer over/under it. Oh well what's it matter, that's too much. &gt;.&lt; And maybe we could also add image-loading already optimized. Haha, that part of SDL sucks ever since I worked through the tutorial. &gt;.&gt;

<br />
<br />I've been wanting to make the ultimate memory controller sometime too, that could be used with this and allow movements of obscene amounts of data on the PRG and CHR buses.
<br />
<br />If there was much interest in something like this, it could be helpful to the project.  I can make the hardware and stuff, but it pretty interesting if I'm not the only person to write software for it.  The newer one could be programmed in C and/or MIPS32 assembly (kinda amusing that it's related to the N64's CPU).  Seems like it would be easy to run a 6502 emulator on there.  Maybe one could have it use the PPU and sound registers to "emulate" the NES, running the code in a virtual machine.

<br />
<br />Seriously, Let's design a mapper that we want, get it into a few emulators for testing, port our games to it and make stuff.
<br />
<br />My mapper wish list:
<br /><ol style="list-style-type: decimal"><li>prog-rom: $e000-$ffff = fixed</li><li>prog-rom: ROM from $8000 to $dfff swappable in 8K banks (8K alignment).</li><li>Up to 256K char-rom or char-ram, swappable in 16-sprite banks.</li><li>8K bram (but I can see making this larger and swappable in banks too).</li><li>2 IRQ scan-line counters. **</li></ol><br />My idea for how IRQ scanline - counting would work is as follows:<br /><ol style="list-style-type: decimal"><li>Game writes the desired scan-line (or scan-line minus one) to a pair of mapper registers, 0xf0 - 0xff to disable (just like a sprite Y coord).</li><li>In game's NMI handler, FIRST instruction after NMI is to "bit" another mapper register.  This triggers the countdown circuit inside the mapper.  (Basically, any read to this address triggers the countdown to start.  Can be abused mid-frame to get more than 2 IRQs per scan-line I guess)</li><li>IRQ automatically fires approximately during hblank at the end of the line before the desired scan-line.</li></ol>

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Maybe I was confusing.  prog-ram from $8000 to $dfff would be divided into 3x 8K banks, each individually swappable with any 8K aligned, 8K chunk of the entire prog-rom, upto the max prog-rom size.
<br />
<br />I would engineer a large game to use the CPU's address space as follows:
<br />
<br />$8000 to $9fff = map data
<br />$a000 to $bfff = sound data
<br />$c000 to $dfff = swappable game logic
<br />$e000 to $ffff = kernel and "library" routines, NMI handlers, main control code.
<br />
<br />I assume that 8K chunks are easier, but in reality, I'd think that 8K is a bit over-kill or swapping sound data.  2K or 4K sized banks would probably be all that is needed for swapping sound data (2K per song set?)  However, I've never designed a mapper, so I have no idea how feasible it is to have different sized banks.
<br />
<br />Maybe just have 8x 4K banks, with the last one fixed.  Bank switching should be accomplished by a simple memory register write (not like MMC1 - takes way too many clock cycles).

<br />
<br />I guess it would be the first cart without PRG-ROM.  Of course the 2A03 still has to boot into something, but it's only 1 byte of ROM.  Program code/data would be stored in a serial Flash memory, the mapper would allow the PIC to copy (hopefully DMA) it into RAM whenever requested, even while the NES CPU and PPU are both using the memory.  The RAM isn't huge (and I don't think SDRAM will be fast enough), but it's plenty for use with bankswitching.
<br />
<br />This would be very different from any other mapper.  Instead of WRAM, maybe you'd want to map some CHR tiles or nametables into $6000-$7FFF and write to CHR anytime.  Maybe instead of CHR banking, something like MMC5's EXRAM could be used.  Just some options.

The colors are extended to 4bpp too, but I need to add some DMA commands that will write to the additional bit planes on vram. They're zero'd out normally, so normal NES tiles show as normal.</div><br /><br />I was doing something like that, but I had two things: lack of coding and still using 8x16, not to mention it is a failure for any NESDev compatibility hardware-wise<br /><br />There was the VR Technologies VT03/VT02/Onebus, but it's documents were machine translated from chinese. and anyone who tried to redocument it left it for dead because of no more interest.<br /><br />CaH4e3 of FCEUMM and Russian Romhacking Fame decoded the Onebus Famiclone series part-way, but at 2011 there was no more news so far, But he still works at BMF and Xkeeper's ''The Cutting Room Floor'' Wiki<br /><br />EDIT:<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">&nbsp; &nbsp;NES OAM attribyte byte &#40;specefication v0.2 alpha/discussion mode&#41;: <br />&nbsp; &nbsp;Original by Tomaitheous of PCEDEV &#40;PC-ENGINE Dev forums&#41;<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 76543210 <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; |||||||| <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ||||||++- Palette &#40;4 to 7&#41; of sprite** <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; |||+++--- Extended/Enhanced NES Sprite support<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ||+------ Priority &#40;0: in front of background; 1: behind background&#41; <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; |+------- Flip sprite horizontally <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; +-------- Flip sprite vertically <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; if it is Extended, original NES/Fami 8x16 mode must be <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; disabled and must choose a extended Size specified below!<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Extended:&nbsp; &nbsp; 000b = 8x8&nbsp; &nbsp;2bpp NES - Original format<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;001b = 8x16&nbsp; 2bpp NES - Original format<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;010b = 16x16 2bpp NES - Extended format<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;011b = 8x8&nbsp; &nbsp;4bpp SNES - Extended format<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;101b = 8x16&nbsp; 4bpp SNES - Extended format<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;110b = 16x16 4bpp SNES - Extended format<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;111b = 32x32 4bpp SNES - Extended format<br /><br /><br />&nbsp; ** = Palette:&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 2bpp = Same as original - $3f00-$3f10<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;4bpp = Extended palette - $3f00-$3fff <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; $3f00-3f0f for four 2bpp BG palette RAM <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; $3F10-3f4f for four 4bpp Sprite/OAM Palette RAM<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; $3F50-3fff Scratch RAM</div>
