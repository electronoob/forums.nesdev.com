<br />Let's shift the topic from jargon to jargon's work. I'll see if I can decipher this Boolean Beakers thing. It appears to be a list of the 16 functions from two booleans to one boolean. But columns 3, 2, 1, 0 should probably have been called AB, A, B, and O, like the blood types. Let me rewrite it in my own words:

<br />
<br />Laserbeak was asking the same thing at the start... and jargon just seemed to reply with more equally cryptic and hard to understand diagrams and seemingly random spoutings.  A brief, simple, down to earth overview of what this is supposed to represent is all I'm looking for.
<br />
<br />
<br />As for making an "advanced beginners" thread -- that's kind of an oxymoron.  Either stuff is beginner or it isn't.  Advanced stuff isn't beginner.  Advanced things should go in the "advanced" forum (NESdev).  But that's a tangent.

<br />I don't know what A and B mean. I don't know how True and False are involved, or basically anything. It shouldn't matter how long I've been programming either. I kind of feel you have to understand everything this diagram is trying to explain before you can make sense of it, which makes it more of a reference table for those who know what they're talking about. This is definitely not newbie-friendly if most of us can't understand it even though we've been here for a while.

<br /><div class="quotetitle">blargg wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">Seriously, it seems to be about the essence of all the possible 2-&gt;1 logic functions, and a minimum of any mundane explanation to clutter the abstract beauty of it.</div>
<br />
<br />Ironcially, I kind of see it just the opposite.  Rather than a small "mundane" explanation of the underlying process, you have an exceedingly large collection of complex diagrams and charts obfuscating what really should be very simple.  I mean I can explain the functionality of any given boolean operator in one sentence.   And here you have pages upon pages of charts.
<br />
<br />But again I could be totally misunderstanding here.
<br />
<br />EDIT -- you know... maybe I shouldn't be so negative.  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_redface.gif" alt=":oops:" title="Embarassed" />
<br />
<br />After rereading this thread, I get the impression that I (and others) responded to it differently than they ordinarily would have because jargon was the poster.  Maybe on a subconsious level I used jargon as an excuse to dump all over this thread from my bowels of negativity (colorful metaphor, no?).  Anyway, sorry about that.
<br />
<br />I'll simply end on a note of "I don't quite understand it", and leave it at that.  If this is a field of interest for jargon, and is something he enjoys researching and documenting, I think we should all be supportive... like we would be for any of the other members here.
<br />
<br />My apologies for my posts so far, jargon.  I hope you don't let the negativity in this thread prevent you from pursuing this further, if you wish.

<br />You know, the way people have been talking about jargon lately reminds me of this other board where there is a guy that's completely immune to all rules, it's kind of a joke. He can do whatever he wants, he's 100% unbannable. Makes him look retarded, but it's quite funny actually, watching his threads.
