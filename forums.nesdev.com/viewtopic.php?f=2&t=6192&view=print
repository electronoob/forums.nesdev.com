		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Every NES emulator has its own color palette. I heard that it's because there are no definite colors somehow. That's why I have a suggestion: What about the colors that the NES games for the Game Boy Advance (that "NES Classic Series") use? Shouldn't they be the basis for the NES palette? I mean, the Game Boy Advance does have definite detectable color values. And the NES games are 1:1 conversions. So, their colors should be the real deal, shouldn't it?

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Are you writing color-blindness testing software for the NES? Or maybe something that could help someone get the correct paint at Lowes? Other than an application like that, I don't see what the value would be in finding "the exact" colors the NES creates. And besides, all the NES is doing is saying: "TV, please excite your red dots THIS much, your green dots THIS much, and your blue dots THIS much." It doesn't actually have any real colors stored (what would that even mean?) *edit*. Even if you could find the exact RGB values, the NES hardware governs how strong the resulting RGB signals (*edit* I have no idea how those signals actually work, just that they somehow communicate RGB information in one way or another) really are...so as far as I understand it (and I don't know much about hardware) the best you can do is some kind of an approximation (if you're writing an emulator or anything else that needs to replicate the NES' palette) unless you were to literally physically clone the NES hardware.
<br />
<br />*edit* I wrote a custom graphics editor for developing NES games, and I used the rgb values depicted in <a href="http://nesdev.com/NESDoc.pdf" class="postlink">NESDoc.pdf</a>. For all I know, those are the correct values. Worked fine for my purposes!

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />What's so hard is that the original NES does not process RGB signals. Instead, it generates a video signal directly in the composite domain to be decoded into RGB by the TV's NTSC decoder. This causes a bit of a problem, as a lot of TVs don't decode NTSC according to spec; some models put more blue into the signal to make it look better on the showroom floor, and some models (especially those for the Japanese market) warp the decoding to try to make flesh tones look better-than-real.
<br />
<br />A couple relatively rare Famicom versions (e.g. Famicom Titler and the one built into a TV) generate RGB signals directly, as do PlayChoice 10 arcade boards. Some of the colors in these palettes are so off that developers of some NES games rereleased in arcades had to change a few colors here and there.

<br />Moreover, the palette in the acNES emulator, used by e-Reader, Animal Crossing, and Classic NES Series, is gamma-corrected for the GBA's comparatively dark screen, not the more-or-less-sRGB display of a TV + GameCube + Game Boy Player accessory or a DS Lite. The palette in Virtual Console for Wii is probably closer to Nintendo's intent.

<br />Using a color palette designed for a portable system with a possibly non-backlit LCD with different gamma depending on the hardware revision doesn't seem like a good idea.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Isn't the NTSC color simulation in Nestopia supposed to be pretty accurate? If so, just load one of the several PD ROMs that show all 52(?) colors on-screen at once, tweak the simulated TV knobs to your liking, take a screenshot, then extract each color one-by-one and place them into a new .PAL file. Load into your favorite emulator and enjoy. That's what I did, anyway.

<br />
<br />But I've been surprised before, one thing that comes to mind is the music engine in Star Tropics 2 doing funny stuff with the $4011 register.
