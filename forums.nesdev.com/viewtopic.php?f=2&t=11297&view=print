		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />FCEUX is generally considered the emulator with the most debugging features, a lot of which aren't available in Nesticle, but it doesn't offer real-time editing of palettes or patterns. At least not visually... it has a memory editor, so it might be possible to change the data there by typing hex numbers, but that would be of very little use.<br /><br />Actually, I can't think of many reasons why real-time editing of graphics would be desired. Editing tiles one by one with primitive tools is tedious and rarely results in nice looking graphics, because you're confined to such little drawing spaces. Also, good graphics hacking often requires tiles to be remapped (for example, if you want Mario's standing sprite in SMB1 to not have a mirrored body you'll have to remap the sprite), so you can't really do anything worth of attention without more careful planning than you can do when editing tiles with a single click.<br /><br />Sure, back when I was a kid that feature was cool as hell, but now I see that that's just a toy, and shouldn't be used for actual hacking purposes.

He is on Win7, and YY-Chr 0.99 Beta 2 or whatever will work perfect for him in this case.
