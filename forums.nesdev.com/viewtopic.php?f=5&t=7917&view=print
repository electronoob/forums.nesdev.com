<br />
<br />I really need help on it!
<br />
<br />I making Adventure Island fangame (playable alpha: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.stencyl.com/game/play/3679">http://www.stencyl.com/game/play/3679</a><!-- m --> , it's in flash) and want to use some of Adventure Island music (actually using right now, as placeholders), but I want to be legal and ask him for permission or if lucky even make him to make some new tunes for me. At this point, I don't know even if he's still alive, because there is no wikipedia page on him.
<br />
<br />Please help me, I really need help with it!

<br />
<br />Today, of course that've changed, but in the days Adventure Islands 1-4 were published was as I said.
<br />
<br />Dunno what about Japan law on this matter, since I don't know JPN copyright laws.

<br />//edit: And even if I am wrong, Mr. Okuyama still may want to make some new tunes for me if he'll feel nostalgic enough <img src="./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" />. So if anyone has any contact info on him or in case if he's deceased can confirm it, I'd be grateful.

<br />However, if you were planning on releasing it on Steam and charging for it, <em>that's</em> when you'd need to worry about permissions. Look at the music in the free and Steam versions of Eversion for an example.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I highly doubt that at the time in Japan artists had any rights for their works if they worked for a company. It is much more probably that Hudson own the rights to the music.
<br />
<br />I wonder, why you need to use music from the original or composed by the original composer. There are people who like to mimic styles of other composers, making new music that sounds very similar to one made by the other composers, but obviously, no third party rights involved in this case. Related to NES, it mostly happens with Capcom music from Mega Man, a LOT of people mimic the style, but I'm sure, you'll be able to find people who want to mimic Adventure Island music as well.
<br />
<br />There also was a guy who made <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/Shnabubula#g/c/FBDD461401CA70E1" class="postlink">series of very authentic 'alternative soundtracks'</a> for NES games. His nickname is Shnabubula, you may try to contact with him, for example.
