<br />The NES itself doesn't understand the iNES header any more than it understands the PKZIP header. So I guess your complaint boils down to the fact that iNES is implemented in the PowerPak and PKZIP is not.
<br />
<br />@FitzRoy: Please don't miss the last comment on the previous page. I want to know whether my interpretation of "frankenfile" and related terms is correct. <a href="http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?LaynesLaw" class="postlink">Layne's Law of Debate</a> states roughly that no progress can be made in a debate until definitions of terms are agreed upon, and as a moderator, it is my duty to help participants understand one another.
<br />
<br />@cpow: FitzRoy wants to make it the equivalent of a table in the appendix instead of a chapter header.

<br />Making it a footer would actually make things more difficult and emulator ROM load-time slower.  One would have to seek to the end of the file + use ftell() (to find out how big the file is), followed by seeking {length-16} then reading 16 bytes, making sure the results match what is considered an iNES header, etc...
<br />
<br />The whole point of a header is to allow software to determine what to do with the remaining data in the file.
<br />
<br />I do have problems/qualms with having a separate file used for this purpose (e.g. the equivalent of having the iNES header in its own file, followed by the ROM (PRG+CHR) in a separate file).  Those qualms might be considered minor to some, but to others are major.  The qualm is that it's a waste of an inode (thus wasted space, depending on the filesystem block size, which these days can vary from 4KBytes to 64KBytes), and this plays a huge role on embedded systems or systems with limited space/capacity (such as small CF cards, etc.).  This acts as further justification as to why the iNES 2.0 method is superior (in this specific regard).
<br />
<br />EDIT: Also for what it's worth, I side with Memblers with regards to using ZIP as a container method.  But I also fully agree with byuu (I think?) who said tar and equivalent was a travesty as well.  ZIP might be the easiest to implement, but there's all sorts of caveats when it comes to the specification (consider 8.3 format vs. long filenames, etc.).  Maybe RAR might work better?  I don't know about licensing / complexities of these formats.  Let's just stay with iNES 2.0 and be done with it ;-)

<br />
<br />ZapFC is a double extension format, it already differentiates itself from a regular zip container. "Frankenfile" is a term I use for distinct parts combined in a unique or arbitrary way.

<br />If we "had it to do all over again" we would use iNES 2.0, but possibly with a larger header that would also include things like:
<br />
<br />1) Dumper (person)
<br />2) Dumper device

<br />It seems silly to me to embed this logic into the emulators, or require yet another data file, your magic database.
<br />
<br />That is like hard-coding the directory contents of a PKZIP file into PKZIP and then stripping it out of the PKZIP file.

<br />You lost me. What could be sillier than each multi-rom system coming up with its own totally unique way of storing the data?

This is the idea you're defending. It is laughable. It's embarrassingly short-sighted is what it is. Thank Jesus on a pogo stick that MAME was at least smarter than that.

<br />
<br />Most of the popular NES emulators are open-source.  Make patches for them.  Create your database (with the checksums of ALL commercial games that you can).  Create a tool to strip off the iNES header from various ROMs.  Prove that you can make a working prototype.  Submit patches and argue your point with the emulator maintainers.
<br />
<br />You are highly unlikely to convince most of us to rush out and implement your idea for you.  Your beating a dead horse.  So prove your point and resurrect it.

<br />
<br />Yeah.
<br />
<br />ZIP supports multiple encryption types, there are compressors (such as 7-zip) that can make ZIP files other tools cannot read, on and on. You can try and enforce no-compression, no-encryption, but the second someone uses zlib or whatever and doesn't bother to check, that program supports compression anyway, and people start relying on it. And now every last emulator and tool has to waste hundreds of KB of source code and third-party libraries to work with these files. Repeat for every compression format used: ZIP, 7-zip, RAR, BZ2, GZ, etc.
<br />
<br />ZIP also doesn't define the specs of filename storage, you can't know whether the filename is UTF-8, SJIS, or something else.
<br />
<br />TAR is just a mess. Dozens of legacy fields and Unix-specific stuff that makes creating the containers a pain in the ass.
<br />
<br />There really is no popular, simplistic container format that end users can easily add and remove files with. Which is why most applications end up using ZIP.
<br />
<br />And end users being able to work with the archives easily is the only thing separating iNES from ZIP. And from a permanent preservation standpoint, there's no telling how long ZIP will remain dominant. Imagine finding a bunch of ARC or LHA files today. Or video in Intel Indeo Video. Sure, you can work with them, but they are certainly obscure.
<br />
<br />I feel that all containers are simply reinventing the file system. A format that stores multiple independent files is called a folder. And compression can be applied automatically and recursively right through modern file systems like NTFS, completely transparently to individual applications.
<br />
<br />The advantage of containers is for distribution, which can be handled better. Give a way to create a download link on a folder, and have the file server send the contents in compressed-form. Allow e-mail clients to attach folders and do the same. Why are end users concerning themselves with what compression format to use, anyway?
<br />
<br />Look at Apple OS X. Programs are named such as TextEdit.app, the .app is really a folder, with individual files inside. The OS treats it like a file, and that's how the end user interacts with it. Now say iNES were like that, and inside the header was its own file. You want compatibility? Include .ines1, .ines2, .xml files that each describe the game, AND let an emulator database override those on commercially released games if it so chooses, so the user doesn't have to update them.
<br />
<br />But back to the real world, where nothing can change, we have iNES and ZIP.
<br />
<br />Yes, people will stick junk in the folders that tools will have to ignore. But then that's just as likely to happen to a common container format like ZIP. Since most people are not idealists, they will ignore extra files, not reject the archives entirely. You'll still get downloaded-from-romsite.txt.

Or are you saying that 100 years from now, we'll reach 1% of the original filesize and ZIP will be abandoned for sheer inefficiency?</div>
<br />
<br />7-zip packs files 10-30% better on average, and solid-archiving provides massive benefits. Especially with barely-changed region variants of game images.
<br />
<br />I think in the future techniques like PAQ will catch on. Where specific compression codecs are used for specific files. Compress WAV files with a FLAC-like codec, bitmaps with something like PNG, text files with a burrows-wheeler approach, and so on. Combine with using more CPU power now that it's available and things will keep improving.
<br />
<br />I'm sure many thought MPEG-2/XviD was amazing until H.264 came along. So you never know what can happen.
