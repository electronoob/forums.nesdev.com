		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Hello everyone!  I'm trying to make my first game after going through the nerdy nights tutorials, and I think I bit off more than I can chew.
<br />
<br />I'm currently working on an arkanoid like clone, and I have hit detection working great for the paddle and walls.  The problem I'm running into currently is what would be the best way to attack the hit detection and nametable updates for the bricks.
<br />
<br />What I've done so far, is I have an array in RAM which represents an 11x11 area of bricks.  My first idea, was to walk through this array during NMI, and update the namespace table accordingly.  Unfortunately, I think this took too many cycles, and I was getting garbled graphics.  So now it seems I will need to check for the hit, and then update VRAM to only remove the brick that was touched instead of updating it RAM, and having the entire array of bricks drawn during NMI.
<br />
<br />This brought another problem, which is since my array of bricks is a regular 1d array, I will need division and multiplication to correctly determine the offset in VRAM that I need to update.  Would you guys recommend creating some lookup tables based on the level data, or have I been going about this completely wrong from the beginning?
<br />
<br />I tried stepping through Taito arkanoid, but I can't quite get my head around how they are doing it in this game.
<br />
<br />If this is too advanced for a noob like me, maybe I should try taking an easier project on to start with to get more comfortable with the NES and CA65.
<br />
<br />Thanks in advance for any guidance anyone can give!

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />For the 1-D array thing, besides look-up tables, if you can afford to use memory less efficiently, you may also align the brick data to 16-byte offsets, so that the first 11 bytes of each 16-byte groups represent a row (or column, depending on how you want to do it) and just waste the 5 remaining bytes (or reuse them in storing other information).
<br />In this way, you can access brick (x, y) by just pointing to entry $xy of the array, and this entry index is very easy to get as you only need to use the shift operations.
