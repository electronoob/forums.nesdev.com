<br />
<br />Features of my system are:
<br />
<br />Outputs clean rgb, s-video, composite video from the multi av jack on the back (uses ntsc snes av cables)
<br />
<br />Has an improved audio circuit that increases the bass and creates pseudo stereo sound. Also properly mixes in the audio from japanese games that have advanced audio chips.
<br />
<br />Has a chip swapped that makes the powerpak run on the system. Also has the nes to famicom adapter modded to included the extended audio from the powerpak mixed into the system audio circuit.
<br />
<br />System is a top loader and is region free
<br />
<br />Here's my demo video

<br />Also does it work with normal toploaders or does it have to be this ultrarare revision ?
<br />What did the original (unmodified) ultrarare revision output on S-Video and RGB pins of the multi-AV out ?
<br />
<br />I am the only one who finds "stereo" completely pointless ? If games were programmed without stereo ability then there is no point to do hacky stereo this way.
<br />Also increase bass is as simple as having an op-amp, once capacitor and two resostors. Definitely not a "very advanced" circuit.

<br />
<br />Also the s-video and composite conversion aren't external they're internal.
<br />
<br />av famicom isn't ultra rare.  Before I installed this mod it outputted nothing on the s-video / rgb pins of the multi av port.
<br />
<br />You can do this mod on any model nes or famicom but the av famicom has an improved pcb that removes a lot of the video interference.  I built a rgb nes before making this and the video jailbar interference was really annoying.
<br />
<br />I posted a lot of questions a long time ago and never got many answers so I went looking for answers elsewhere.
<br />
<br />As for the poor audio mixing I built a couple of nes stereo sound mods I found on the net and installed them on the av famicom.  Games that didn't have advanced audio chips sounded great but games like castlevania 3 j suddenly the sound effects were much louder than the music.
<br />
<br />I don't mind explaining what was done I just figured I'd wait for people to ask questions before going into detail.

<br />
<br />And I agree with those who said that these stereo-mods don't sound right!
<br />I think in your case it's noise+triangle+dpcm on the right speaker and the two square-waves on the left plus some mixing, am I right? Not really my thing, especially for the original games, but there certainly are people who like it, such as some chip-tune musicians.
<br />
<br />I like however, how clear the audio output of your av famicom was!
<br />Is that really just because of the revised board or did you do a mod for cleaner audio? (because I would like to have that for the regular NES!)

<br />I've been using a proxy company to order these kits.  The instructions are all in japanese.  The pcb has everything clearly marked where to install all the parts.  The instruction paper tells you which marked spot takes which part if it's not already marked.  Here's pics of the pcb with no parts installed

<br /><img src="http://i240.photobucket.com/albums/ff253/TheDrakon/s-video%20kit/instructionsback.jpg" alt="Image" />
<br />
<br />The only part of the instructions that really need translating is where they tell you which colour rings corrospond to which resistor strength.  My girlfriend can read chinese so she made me a handy little chart:
<br />
<br /><img src="http://i240.photobucket.com/albums/ff253/TheDrakon/s-video%20kit/resistortranslation.jpg" alt="Image" />
<br />
<br />The video circuit is fairly simple.  Sync goes into a lm1881 and from the lm1881 output it goes into a cxa1645m.  I also tap the sync coming out of the lm1881 and wire that into the sync pin on the multi av port.  RGB go through 10uf caps and then straight into the cxa1645.  The cxa1645 amps the brightness and converts the video to very clean rgb, s-video, and composite.
<br />
<br />The audio circuit is indeed a couple of op amps and a virtual ground.  I wrote "very advanced" because I was posting this work on forums where people aren't very knowledgable and I just copy and pasted what I posted there.
<br />
<br />The clarity of the audio is caused by the audio circuit on this upgrade pcb.  The audio comparison video I made takes recordings from the same av famicom system before and after I modify the audio circuit.  I havn't analyzed it too thoroughly but I'm sure you guys can figure out what about it makes the audio so nice.
<br />
<br />The first kit I ordered for myself I chose not to get the audio circuit parts.  I didn't take interest in the audio mod at first but a lot of clients kept asking me about it and showed a lot of interest.  That's why I did the audio mod.
<br />
<br />The plus side of this kit is that all the pins of the rgb chip that don't connect to the system are seperated by the kit pcb traces.  Therefore if you want to use a composite ppu all you need to do is pull the kit out of the socket and stick a composite ppu into the socket.  The audio mod requires you to cut traces on the pcb so it's a bit more destructive.  Since I wire the audio connections into a header it would be fairly easy to wire the other end of the cut traces into a connection that would fit the header and restore the original circuit.

<br />
<br />You're not the only one.  The "stereo mod" crap really irritates me; once you tell someone that the "stereo mod" just results in the two triangle channels coming out of the right speaker and the triangle/noise and PCM coming out the left, they go "Uhhhh.... screw that".  The stereo mods result in the music itself sounding like complete and total crap; this wasn't how the musicians intended for their stuff to be listened to, it was intended to be monaural.
<br />
<br />That said, the *quality* difference of the audio mod in question is quite nice.  It must be using an OPAMP of some kind, and/or some very basic filter circuitry.  I noticed that the PCM "pops" are significantly minimised.  However, those "pops" are actually used by some games for a drum/bass beat, such as in the "underground" areas in Crystalis.  You can hear what I'm talking about <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1dneoKn9uo" class="postlink">quite clearly in this video</a>.  That distinct "pop" is what gets filtered out.  NSF players which support "PCM pop filtering" result in those songs sounding like crap.  Not sure if that's the same filtering methodology as what's being done by the F-LABO guys, but if so they should really make these "features" toggleable via (externally-accessible) DIP switches.  A "Stereo/Mono" switch and a "PCM filter on/off" switch would be two I'd want.
<br />
<br />Also, if folks want some of the F-LABO pages translated, let me know.  I should be more precise: *certain parts* of the page translated.  Translating the entire thing would be too much.  Just copy/paste whatever you want translated here and I'll have it taken care of.
<br />
<br />Regarding <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7v7e-bjB13s" class="postlink">the video</a> -- wow, look at the Contra title screen.  Who decided on the RGB conversion palette?  It looks like shit.  Look at the skin colour of Bill and Lance.  Do they have jaundice?  Also, why is there a bunch of screen noise (looks like PPU problems/bugs!) to the right of Bill and Lance's picture on the modded/RGB unit?  It's quite apparent throughout the entire video during gameplay too.  There's another video on Youtube of someone showing off an S-video modded Famicom playing Castlevania 3, and the colours there also look extremely "amplified" (bordering on washed out).  Why would someone put up with this?
