I like isometric stuff better. The bottom screenshots for these look good, but when the lines converge it looks very ugly. My brain refuses to see those as believable enviroments. DT looks just plain ugly and I would never believe that the carpet from the EB shot is really on the floor.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=95">tokumaru</a> — Thu Jan 19, 2006 4:36 pm</p><hr />

Actually, doing an isometric game on the SNES instead of the PSX is already a challange. So doing an isomertic game on the NES is even more challenging. Push the system to its limit is good, but if it is the limits of the system that push your ideas down, that's bad. I now tried to make isometric graphics with tile layer, and it looks pretty easy to do. Scince the map will be 3D, that will impressive the player, so the graphics themselves doesn't have to be outstanding (at least not on the NES). I'll have only a few different metatiles, including grass, water, etc... The hard part will be to handle all possible combinations. About palettes, I've almost fixed the problem, using an MMC5 isn't even needed. I got 4 main metatiles : grass, water, stone and earth (variant of them could exist). So I have 4 combinations of palettes that works with every combination of metatiles exept grass&amp;water, which I'll exclude. I think I just have to design the game without having adjacent tiles of grass and water. That will also simplyfy the tileset, which should include combinations of every metatiles together with every "cliff" possible.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=38">Bregalad</a> — Sun Jan 15, 2006 9:58 am</p><hr />

People talking about relistic games are just contradicting themselves.<br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"><br />You do it at compile time. Go buy Starcraft and play with its map editor.<br /></div><br />You can do it at compile time, but the real 3D map should also be here for collision and sprite positionning. So you can either code both 2D map and 3D map in ROM, hoping that you won't create bugs so both won't correspond, or do a programm that mazes a 3D map in 2D.<br /><br />For now I think I just have to play with tile layer and try to have isometric graphics, and think if this is doable in a NES game or not. Maybe I should wait to code on the SNES to think about isometric games, because SNES have tiles precision palettes and layering effects. I can have up to 4 BG layers if using mode 0, but then the BGs have only 4 colors per tile.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=38">Bregalad</a> — Sun Jan 15, 2006 2:15 am</p><hr />
