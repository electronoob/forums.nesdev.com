Well would the NES be able to move individual sections of tiles up and down independently of each other like this?  Let's say for example the game in question has pillars that smash down at different times to kill the player in one hit and they're made up of background tiles.  Is this possible on the NES?

You would need one set of tiles for the bottom end if the pillar is moves by a character per step, or few sets if you want it to make more smooth.
<br />
<br />Here is example of a pillar that is moves one char per step, it uses just six tiles:

<br />
<br />To move the entire ceiling, a simple scroll split can be used, but in order to move individual sections up and down you have to edit the nametables and actually draw the pillars in the positions you need them.
<br />
<br />To minimize the amount of tiles that need to be updated, most (all?) games that have done this used pillars without any vertical detail, so that only the top/bottom end had to be updated.
<br />
<br />Here's an example of the effect: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://youtu.be/dWHPNnrTmKs?t=8m42s">http://youtu.be/dWHPNnrTmKs?t=8m42s</a><!-- m -->

<br />I was wanting to put something like this in my game that only has two frames of animation to appear like it's spinning and it kills the player on contact.  I wanted a section where there are multiple saws like this and they move up and down independently of each other in a smooth slow process.  They would of course be tiles rather than sprites because I know that would kill the NES instead of the player and make sprite flicker out the behind.
<br />
<br />I would be willing to compromise if my expectations are unreasonable, such as make the thing move tile by tile (8x8 pixels I mean) really fast and then stop to take a break before it slams down again to appear it's moving smoothly albeit quickly.
<br />
<br />If it helps to know, I'm not making my game in an NES rom, rather I'm making it an EXE and trying to keep the limitations of the NES in the game as accurately as possible but information on the hardware capabilities of the NES is scattered all over the place.  I've even went so far as to put sprite flicker and slow down in my game if too many sprites are on the screen at once.
<br />
<br />Would it be possible with that first technique Shiru mentioned?

<br />
<br />The reason why you need to not have vertical detail is that it allows to update only end of the pillar, instead of all the tiles of a pillar - there is a rather tight limitation how many bytes (tiles) in a nametable is possible to update per frame.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I saw more than three distinct colors in the saw blade. The NES grays are approximately #666666, #b2b2b2, and #ffffff.
<br />
<br />The nametable is a grid of 32x30 tiles. There is enough video memory bandwidth to change 128 tiles in one frame, or 160 in a few special cases, in addition to uploading the sprite display list to OAM. This count includes the scroll seam, the horizontal or vertical strip of tiles changed on the nametable whenever the camera moves. If you shrink your buzz saw to 64x64 pixels, or about 1/4 of the width of the screen, that's 64 changed tiles. Another option is to make it a flat, reciprocating blade that moves to the left and right by a couple pixels as two frames of animation; that would cut your updates down to about 24 tiles.
<br />
<br />If you move things using two different sets of colors in units of 8x8 pixels, there will be "attribute clash", or an artifact on the seam between two differently colored areas. These artifacts can be seen in boss battles in Cabal if I remember correctly. I'd turn the shaft gray to avoid this, but if you insist on it being green, you can cover up the seam with a sprite, as is seen in the title screen of Tetris 2 and several places in Bucky O'Hare.
<br />
<br />Do you have a screenshot so that we can make other recommendations on NES authenticity or possibly even an actual port to the NES once the PC game is done?

<br />
<br />OK well I shrunk the saw blade down to 64x64 and changed the color of the shaft to the same grays and I didn't realize it had too many colors even though I knew there could only be three colors and the background color, so I got rid of one of the grays.  This will take place on a black background of course.

<br />
<br />If you update each blade every other frame, (i.e. at 30Hz) you could animate 5 blades (the most that would be visible in a single screen) and still update a column of tiles and attributes for scrolling left and right.
<br />
<br />The blades will still have to move 8 pixels at a time, unless you dedicate more tiles for the intermediary steps of animation.

Does anyone know what capabilities the Mega Man NES games have that an NES game without an expansion chip doesn't have?  I'm trying to make a game along those lines.  I could've swore the NES Mega Man games use an expansion chip of some kind.

<br />
<br />So yeah all Mega Man games uses expansion chip (mappers), but they use common mappers which just allows more ROM. Mega Man 3-6 uses the MMC3 which has a scanline counter which makes raster effects easier.
<br />Nothing all that special if you ask me.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />That's true in one sense. So let me try to formalize this concept of "nothing all that special". The MMC1 and the discrete logic mappers aren't really "expansion chips" in the same sense as the coprocessors in Super NES carts. The discrete mappers and MMC1 just allow accessing more memory, not performing effects that would be impractical without such a chip such as multiple raster splits. When I hear "expansion chips" on the NES, I mostly think of IRQs, fine grained CHR ROM bankswitching, Famicom expansion sound, and other more advanced features. According to the table you linked, MMC3 (#4) and MMC5 (#5) together make up only 25%, while MMC1 and the most common discrete logic mappers make up over 60%.
