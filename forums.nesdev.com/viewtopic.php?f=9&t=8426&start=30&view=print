<br />Definitely better because ORing two data lines will yield nonsense data. Plus OR gate chips don't have 3-state buffers required for interfacing to a data bus.
<br />
<br />--
<br />
<br />If I really wanted to make a new cart of this I'd sooner hack the menu to work with simpler hardware, or write another one. Hacking the mapper could get it down to 3 or 4 extra chips instead of the large amount with the current inefficient design.
<br />
<br />The decoding isn't very hard because you can take advantage of a pattern:
<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">rockman&nbsp; &nbsp;size<br />1&nbsp; &nbsp;2m/cram -- pad prg and use for menu<br />2&nbsp; &nbsp;2m/cram<br />4&nbsp; &nbsp;4m/cram<br />6&nbsp; &nbsp;4m/cram<br />3&nbsp; &nbsp;2m/2m -- pad chr<br />5&nbsp; &nbsp;2m/2m<br />-&nbsp; &nbsp;4m/2m -- unused, undecoded<br />-&nbsp; &nbsp;4m/2m -- unused, undecoded<br /></div>
<br />
<br />So technically you could decode a '161 using the MMC3's WRAM decoder, then use another couple chips to fix the addressing.

<br />With a lot of bankswitches, this 18-cycle difference might be the last straw that causes the main loop to exceed 241 lines. If the original bankswitch was inlined and the ROM hack patches each mapper write with a JSR/RTS pair (likely), the difference might be 30 to 32 cycles. How many times does Mega Man 1 bankswitch per frame?

<br />
<br />If the IRQs were firing I think you'd experience something worse but I'm not sure. Or maybe they bothered to alter the IRQ routines to disable it if they did fire. I didn't study the hacked versions much.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />But to be fair to the MMC3: A program originally designed for MMC3 might use $A000 as the only switchable bank and leave bank select set to $46 (or $C6 to swap the pattern tables) most of the time. This leaves one instruction to switch $A000 (that is, STA $8001) throughout the main thread, which is fast as UNROM. The only time the mode would change would be to load a new DMC sample into $C000 ($8000:=$47, $8001:=bank number, $8000:=$46) or to change CHR banks (in the NMI or IRQ handler, after which point back to $46). It's just using MMC3 to emulate UNROM that might run into slowdown.

<br />
<br />Just wanted to add a piece of informations someone may find useful (or not).
<br />
<br />Since I have two (2) different carts of that Rockman 6in1 I tried to find out if there are any differences, but just before that I'd like to personally say I think all of them Rockmans suffers some kind of slowdowns when there is like too many things on the screen at the particular time (i.e. just try to "collect" as many bees as you can right at the beginning of the "Hardman" stage in Rockman 3, you'll notice that right away), so it's kinda "natural" I'd say, as for that "Iceman" stage from Rockman 1 I haven't noticed anything unusual, maybe just a little slowdown <strong>l_oliveira</strong>, but there is this one enemy on some other stage in Rockman 1 (I don't exactly remember where it was...), flying rocket or something, when you hit it, it explodes with massive blast radius causing a huuuuuge slowdown, that is something, or hell even while firing "electro shot" you can experience something little bit similar.
<br />
<br />Now, on to the differences. Right of the bat not only the casing is different but also a PCB and a menu screen :
<br />
<br />"Regular" Rockman 6in1 cart &gt;&gt; <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://img535.imageshack.us/img535/3084/r6in1.jpg">http://img535.imageshack.us/img535/3084/r6in1.jpg</a><!-- m -->
<br />and it's PCB (hi-res) &gt;&gt; <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://img812.imageshack.us/img812/3319/r6in1b.jpg">http://img812.imageshack.us/img812/3319/r6in1b.jpg</a><!-- m -->

<br />and game select screen &gt;&gt; <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://img825.imageshack.us/img825/1850/r6in1scr.jpg">http://img825.imageshack.us/img825/1850/r6in1scr.jpg</a><!-- m -->
<br />
<br />What's also kinda weird is this "Loading..." screen that appears for like noticeable half a second right after choosing any game. It's like all the games are packed or something and they're need to be decrunched, I dunno, but I always enjoy watching that flashy quickie load screen  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_redface.gif" alt=":oops:" title="Embarassed" /> 
<br />
<br />I believe that Sony chip from the back side is just a regular SRAM, but the "main" one is that "MX29L3211MC-10 - 32M-BIT [4M x 8/2M x 16] CMOS SINGLE VOLTAGE PAGEMODE FLASH EEPROM - Macronix International" &gt;&gt; <a href="http://www.alldatasheet.com/datasheet-pdf/pdf/74493/MCNIX/MX29L3211MC-10.html" class="postlink">pdf here</a>, so that glob-top seems to be only just a mapper (with/without menu screen), correct me if I'm wrong.
<br />
<br />As for the games, all Rockmans aren't "screwed up" with extra lifes, only copyrights have been removed from Rockman 3, the rest is fine... but, yeah, one big thing that affects the entire, sweet cake that multicart is... unfortunately at precise point of Rockman 1 (that waterpipe at the beginning of the 3-rd (I believe?) part of Dr.Wily's stage, right after water flushes in) game suddenly (!) switch back to the title screen like nothing ever happen <img src="./images/smilies/icon_cry.gif" alt=":cry:" title="Crying or Very sad" /> 
<br />Believe me, I've tried everything on like 4 or 5 different consoles (including famiclones).
<br />Sad sad thing it is.
<br />
<br />Anyway, I hope all this will help somehow.

<br />
<br />Rockman resetting could be for many reasons. Maybe they just did a poor job of hacking.
