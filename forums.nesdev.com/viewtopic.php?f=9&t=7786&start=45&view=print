		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Yeah my concern would be why it doesn't work.  If it's something to do with how the roms are programmed through the CPU, I would have to figure out how to program the roms and avoid this problem.  
<br />
<br />One option would be to have the micro controller or an off board programmer handle the programming of the roms. 
<br />
<br />But I'm just guessing here.  My board would be electrically equivalent to the original cart so a clone wouldn't care.  But it would seem that the powerpak is too.  So this is why I'm guessing that the issue is in the programming of the roms or an issue in the boot menu.  
<br />
<br />All I really know is there is something that needs to be done differently because the powerpak isn't capable and I'd like to be.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />It doesn't start at all IIRC. So no worries about the ROM's not uploading incorrectly, although that still may happen. I don't think we know? Some clones also play it IIRC, but I think it's the retron 3. Also, I have heard most retron 3's or whatever don't play it. It varies on model. But still, clones aren't worth anything. Especially worrying about development on.

<br />I can't find anything anywhere that tells me what IIRC and PHI2 are.  Can you direct me to a resource on the matter or fill me in?

<br />
<br />On a hard reset or long soft reset the PowerPak enters a boot state from which the FPGA is initially configured for loading the menu located on the CF. If the clone has different electrical characteristics it's my guess that this won't happen.
