Install this, and your computer shuts down much faster.<br /><a href="http://schinagl.priv.at/nt/hardlinkshellext/hardlinkshellext.html" class="postlink">Link Shell Extension</a>, and <a href="http://homepage1.nifty.com/emk/symlink-1.06-x86.cab" class="postlink">Symbolic Links Driver</a> for Windows XP.  Adds NTFS symbolic links to Windows XP, and an easy way to create them!<br /><br />Seriously, symbolic links are amazing.  They let you have a tiny hard drive, and put all your big files on a network share, and the applications that use the big files can't tell the difference.  Or even have files from a read-only medium appear side-by-side with writable files in the same directory.

Might need to give it a different name if you already have a different program with that name.<br />Also, the symbolic links driver needs to be started manually before it works, so add &quot;C:\WINDOWS\system32\senable.exe install&quot; it to your startup folder on the start menu.

Mentioning 'em here in case other people haven't heard of these utilities/tools.<br /><br />The only one that isn't mentioned on that page is something called &quot;Tooltip Fixer&quot;, which I'll explain:<br /><br />Occasionally I've seen Windows XP show a tooltip (those boxes seen when hovering your mouse over something for a while) behind the taskbar, and gets indefinitely stuck that way (<a href="http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/windows/how-to-fix-system-tray-tooltips-not-displaying-in-windows-xp/" class="postlink">reference</a> / <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/912650" class="postlink">MS KB article with a shitty &quot;solution&quot;</a>).  Since Microsoft only cares about selling new crap and not fixing the old, we'll never see a fix for this problem.<br /><br />Anyway, on occasion I've figured out how to get rid of it, but more often than not it's there indefinitely and requires one to end-task explorer.exe (Windows Explorer) -- which is absolutely horrible because tons of programs do not properly re-register themselves in the notification area if you've done that (so now you have a program that's running with no way to bring up any part of its UI), including some of Microsoft's own utilities.  I'd rather reboot than end-task explorer.exe.<br /><br />The technical root cause <a href="http://www.msfn.org/board/topic/96967-fixing-tooltip-behind-the-windows-taskbar/page__view__findpost__p__671953" class="postlink">is stated here</a>.  My memory fails me often these days so I could be remembering a different thing, but I believe all the .exe does is run a single Win32 API function with a value of 0 or NULL (I forget which) as one of the parameters.  I remember looking at MSDN to see the function to see what it did, and a 0 or NULL value resulted in &quot;special behaviour&quot;, having originally been created back during Windows 3.x.  APIs are hard when you have jackasses writing code.

Some people swear by FAR, but those people are weird. The amount of life-improving tools this program has is staggering.<br /><br />If you're looking for a good free text editor, I'd recommend <a href="http://www.pspad.com/" class="postlink">PSPad</a>. Has all the features of commercial editors plus a lot more (column block mode, mass search and replace, color picker/translator). Lovely little program.<br /><br />If you want to switch from Winamp, but don't like foobar2000, you can always try <a href="http://www.un4seen.com/xmplay.html" class="postlink">XMPlay</a>. Has support for Winamp input/dsp plugins, it's own plugin/transparent archive support/skinning system, very low memory footprint, the best module playback library out there and some very nifty features. Haven't used any other player ever since I discovered it, and I don't plan on switching anytime soon.

NotePad++ is feature-rich with nice features like Regular Expressions, and it supports Unicode, and any other encoding you can think of.<br />MadEdit is the text editor of choice when your file isn't ANSI or Unicode.  It does a great job of guessing a text file's encoding (except for CP437), and it's &quot;Find in Files&quot; feature actually works with encoded text, unlike Notepad++ which is UTF-8 only.  MadEdit also has a hex editor, and it can view and edit multi-byte characters with no problems.  Only problem is that when you copy and paste, it always uses text characters for the clipboard.  It will only copy hex characters if you hold shift, and won't paste hex characters at all.
