		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Since there is no PMOS transistor in the CPU, whenever the CPU wants to write a 1, only a weak NMOS transistor mounted drives the bus line to +VCC. If an EPROM (or another thing) is trying to pull the line low, it will succeed without any doubt, and a '0' will be output.<br /><br />If the CPU wants to write a '0', it's more ambiguous. A strong NMOS transistor in the CPU will drive the line to GND, but an external EPROM will probably be made of CMOS technology, and so a strong PMOS transistor in the EPROM will also drive the line to +VCC. The situation is ambiguous.<br />NMOS transistors are usually stronger than PMOS so again the '0' from the CPU will probably win, but the EPROM could as well be made of more modern transistors that will win against the CPU. In this case, the EPROM could as well win with it's '1'. Also, the mapper is physically closer to the EPROM (I'm not sure if this actually plays a role).<br /><br />For this reason, both the AND behaviour, and the &quot;EPROM wins&quot; behaviour could be encountered, and be considered correct. Only thing I'd say is that the CPU will never win by writing a conflicting '1'.<br /><br />EDIT : It's possible that mask ROMs in NES games were not CMOS, but NMOS too, like the CPU, especially for early (&lt;1988) made games which had 128kb or more of PRG ROM (you know, those games which became hot when you play them for a long period of time). In this case, the AND behaviour is without a doubt what will be encountered.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />If it's on the powerpak that's outputing a '1' the CPU should win either way.  If the powerpak outputs a '0' the powerpak will probably win either way.<br /><br />If it's really an unknown, but you're most likely to get an AND or an OR function depending on things specific to the cartridge and such why now just implement both.  Randomly select whether it's AND/OR or possibly powerpak logic above.  A game shouldn't rely on bus conflicts.  You're really only looking to break a game that has bus conflicts for homebrew development correct?  If that's the case something like the ability to turn on warning messages might be nice where you display transparent text informing the developer that they're causing bus conflicts and could get strange behavior.  But if you were to bankswitch via bus conflict your game will probably jam anyways giving you enough info to know something's going wrong.  You just need to make sure something goes wrong, so there aren't surprises when running on the NES.<br /><br />More importantly make sure you're only implementing bus conflicts when the mapper is subject to them, as Tepples linked to.  Basically all discrete mappers are subject to bus conflicts except ANROM.  Since the other members of that mapper family have bus conflicts, you won't be able to implement bus conflicts unless you use submappers.  You certainly wouldn't want to implement bus conflicts on any of the ASIC mappers, You'd have to check each one, but I'd guess none of them do.

One thing the warnings do is expose bugs in the <em>emulator</em> where it's doing something wrong that causes warnings where there shouldn't be.
