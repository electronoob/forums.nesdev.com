Iirc the whole key-key thing started because it was mentioned on the cic's patent.

Although I believe you, it's just there's too much evidence it does work. Maybe something else is wrong with your testing? But if it did actually fail to take the floating as a key setting and considered it a lock, why wouldn't it just reset on and off like normal and not just hold reset?
