<br />
<br />No, I Looked, Infogrames must have found a way around. I looked at RAM. $700 (Main/Status Bar Sprites?) and $200 (Player) have sprite data.

I haven't tried this myself, I don't know if any games use this and I don't see much use for that since you don't usually want a big black bar in the middle of your screen, but this is possible.

<br />This would be great for a 2P game that works like Sonic 2's competition mode, where each player uses half of the screen.
<br />
<br />In Sonic 2, both players race in the same level and whoever reaches the end first wins. On the NES, you could explore the idea even further, because with CHR-ROM nothing would stop you from switching new patterns and a new palette for the bottom part of the screen, meaning that the players could even be in different levels, as long as the engine supports this (2 levels loaded at once). Speed would also be an issue, because the NES would be in fact processing 2 separate games at the same time. It could work smoothly in a simpler game.
<br />
<br />I think this is just too cool... letting 2 people play the game at the same time, at their own pace, occasionally meeting when necessary, would be fantastic! With 2 different playfields, 8 blanked scanlines in the middle of the screen would not be a problem at all.
<br />
<br />EDIT: Back on the topic of "sprite expansion", this seems to be the only way to use more than 64 sprites. This multiplexing only works vertically though, so it probably is impossible to have more than 8 sprites per scanline.

<br />People have been proved wrong about hardware limitations before, so I'll not risk saying "it's impossible", that's all. Once in a while someone discovers pretty weird ways of extending the capabilities of old hardware, so who knows?

<br />How about "it was impossible while the NES was still putting food on the table"?
