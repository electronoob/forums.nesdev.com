<br />MMC1 is limited to 128 KiB CHR ROM. You still need space for the menu, so unless one of the ROMs is 128 KiB, you'll still need some space for the menu.
<br />
<br />Go up to SUROM, and you can fit 12 games (480 KiB) + menu, or more if some games use CHR RAM, NROM-128, or easily compressible tilesets. To encourage this, you can award a couple bonus points at judging time for ROMs smaller than the maximum.
<br />
<br />As for a web site, you can probably abuse MediaWiki to act as your CMS, like StepMania.com does.

Also using chr ram and loading the chr rom into the ram before booting would definitly be a hit on the amount of games we can put on the cart.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />What hasn't been mentioned (and is pretty important for setting the rules), who is judging?  I think we could have a panel of judges (or simply let the contestants make up the panel - but can't rate your own entry).
<br />
<br />Also I would say that the size limitation is pointless (especially if we have knowledgeable judges that can take size into account if they want to).  A really good 16kB game is going to beat a lousy 64kB game.  Having the size limit though would mean the 64kB game would be crippled or not even happen.
<br />
<br />Also the talk of building and selling multicarts of the entries is a bit premature.  We should see what happens in the end.  Also, the estimate of about $23 each for Retrozone parts alone is outrageous.  I would aim for (and sure I could achieve) more like $6 in parts costs, almost 75% cheaper.
<br />
<br />Also even if a multicart is built, CHR-RAM or CHR-ROM really shouldn't matter.  If the game uses CHR-ROM, you just load it into the RAM before running it.  You can typically run stuff like CNROM games on 8kB CHR-RAM without a hitch (and even better size-wise, if you use compression).

<br />Not really, as long as the CHR-ROM entries are limited to NROM (8KB of CHR). The menu can have some info about each game (like the type of mirroring they use and whether they have CHR-RAM or CHR-ROM), enough to configure everything before they run. If a game uses CHR-ROM, its tiles are copied to VRAM, if not, just leave it as is, the game itself will take care of uploading its tiles.
<br />
<br />I don't think the games should know they are in an MMC1 cart though, and shouldn't be allowed to use any of the mapper's features (such as dynamic mirroring).
<br />
<br />EDIT: I think that deciding on the specs will be tough. If everyone is free to use whatever they want, making a multicart will be very hard. And by disallowing certain configurations you might be reducing the number of entries.
<br />
<br />Another very important thing that wasn't discussed yet (AFAIK): the deadline. How much time do you think people would have to work on their games? Can works already in progress be used (that might not be fair to people who haven't started yet)?
