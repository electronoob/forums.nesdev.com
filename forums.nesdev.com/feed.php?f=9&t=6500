A big thanks to everyone for their efforts and information!<br /><br />Sugam, I can't believe you're willing to do what you've written, you seem like an out-of-this-world philantropist. <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /> If the mobo CPU works and you send the thing to me AND I can't get it fixed, I'll definitely order a working one through you and keep yours for parts (or send it further along, if you prefer).<br /><br />@blargg: Awesome and highly useful tips, I really appreciate them.<br /><br />@hyarion: The socket is blue. But I guess that will change, unless Sugam was thinking about giving away the PCB without the modulator/sockets, which I doubt. If it does turn out that way, and the power supply really doesn't work (hope it will, though), I just might need your black-socketed console. <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=4096">artakserkso</a> — Thu Jun 17, 2010 4:02 am</p><hr />

I have compared the power connectors on the NTSC and PAL NES. The difference is that the PAL one is more picky, as the inner pin is wider. This means that a PAL power adaptor will fit the NTSC as well, but not vice-versa, since the NTSC adaptor is the one that has a narrower plug and will only fit the NTSC NES. So you don't need a new adaptor if you have one for your PAL NES.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=17">blargg</a> — Thu Jun 17, 2010 12:40 am</p><hr />

Well, I can't really test it with another CPU, but I probably can have the PCB traces fixed.

Wow, what a great offer!<br /><br />Hm... I have a broken PAL NES and the most probable cause seems to be the PPU.
