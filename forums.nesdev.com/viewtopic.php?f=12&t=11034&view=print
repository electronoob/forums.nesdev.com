		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />You are trying to do this in software? My inclination is to say that it would be easier to build/hack a controller that would remap any of the buttons for you. A schematic for a controller is over here (if you want to do it from scratch): <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.gamesx.com/controldata/nessnes.htm">http://www.gamesx.com/controldata/nessnes.htm</a><!-- m --><br /><br />If not, I'm not sure exactly how it would work, but you'd probably have to do something like (in a debugging emulator like the debugging version of SNES 9x): <br />wait for a read of $4218/$4219 <br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://wiki.superfamicom.org/snes/show/Registers">http://wiki.superfamicom.org/snes/show/Registers</a><!-- m --><br />Then there will probably be something like a mask to check a specific joypad button, you'll probably just have to switch which bit is getting masked when.<br /><br />The issue may be that you'd have to check for all the instances. I am not sure how it would work in an &quot;official game&quot; but the B/A buttons work differently in different situations (ie when you ride different animal characters, or are in a menu for selecting your file...haven't played the DKC games in very long). The input may also be stored in different variables in RAM for different purposes (ie a momentary press, versus a hold). See bazz's sample code:<br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://wiki.superfamicom.org/snes/show/Polling+Controller+Input">http://wiki.superfamicom.org/snes/show/ ... ller+Input</a><!-- m -->

Also the L and R buttons were a separate little board attached by wires so it would be pretty easy to hack that. This one was a Tomec. Looked kind of like this: <br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://thomashunter.name/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/IMG_0557.jpg">https://thomashunter.name/wp-content/up ...

This is probably pretty noob stuff if your electronics knowledge is on point, but I haven't messed with TTL-type chips in a long time. Anyway I tried out this circuit I came across:<br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.gamesx.com/controldata/nessnes.htm">http://www.gamesx.com/controldata/nessnes.htm</a><!-- m --><br /><br />and recreated it on a breadboard.

Only thing was I had to sacrifice the plug from a third party SNES controller: <br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://instagram.com/p/lQjHxEP9S-/">http://instagram.com/p/lQjHxEP9S-/</a><!-- m -->

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Hey, <br /><br />I've made that circuit before.  It works great!    The reason why I asked the question of button remapping is that I make an adapter/interface to run a Snes (and NES)  to jamma (arcade game cabinet).   My arcade cabinets only have 3, sometimes 2 push buttons....so I was trying to get DK's buttons to be the same as mario world and some others......all within the constraints of the arcade cabinet button configurations..  A,B, and Y are my buttons 1,2 &amp; 3.   DKC uses button X (to swap kongs) and I don't have a 4th button on the cabinet.   So this is why I was asking about the button swapping... To make the game conform to the ABY mapping.  But I worked out my issues with some mux's.   (yes, I know select swaps the kongs too)<br /><br />Appreciate you thinking of me. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />. Thanks!!!!
