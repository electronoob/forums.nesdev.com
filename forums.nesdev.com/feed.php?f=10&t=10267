<div class="quotetitle">Six wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"><br />I have notepad and notepad++, if that works<br /></div><br /><br />Notepad++ has a neat little command line plugin that I use to compile called nppexec.  You can find it in the plugin manager, and install it from there.  Then, put asm6.exe in the same folder that has your code.  Press F6, and a little script editor will pop up that allows you to determine what nppexec will run in the command line.  I use:<br /><br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">cd $(CURRENT_DIRECTORY)<br />ASM6 $(FILE_NAME) &quot;$(NAME_PART).nes&quot;<br /></div><br /><br />What it does it:<br />1. Go to the current folder<br />2.  Run ASM6.  Have it compile our file (eg. game.asm) to a .nes (game.nes)<br /><br />You can then save that script and can run it whenever you want to compile by pressing F6, and then &quot;OK&quot;.  A little area will open up on the bottom of notepad++ and will give you the compiler's outputs (like telling you if there was a mistake on line 1147, or that everything is fine).<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=6054">Sanchezman</a> — Wed Jul 10, 2013 10:24 pm</p><hr />

I've always been interested in NES development. Around last year, I learned about 6502 assembly language, and all the homebrew games people have made. I wanted to try and make my own.<br /><br />However, no assemblers seem to work. The same thing always happens. It shows the command prompt for a split second, and then it disappears. Nothing happens after that.<br /><br />Are there any 6502 assemblers that actually work? Or am I just doing something wrong?<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=6065">Six</a> — Wed Jul 10, 2013 3:42 pm</p><hr />
