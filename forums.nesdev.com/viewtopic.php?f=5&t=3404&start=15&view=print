<br />
<br />Anyway... a very very nice period which will never be replaced by any PlayStation, Wii or XBox systems... It's not the same feeling. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" />

I wasn't aware of those until a couple of weeks ago. Also, they are wired for EPROMs, right? I'm a fan of Flash ROMs and that's all I have, so I guess I'd still have to rewire those, so I fail to see the real advantage, and since I already have the carts...<br /><br />When I finish my UOROM game though, I will probably get a few boards (Memblers said he also had boards that support UOROM, IIRC) to put it in actual carts. It's really cool that bunnyboy sells cases too!<br /><br />Oh, and ReproPak would not handle MMC3 for example. I got myself a few extra MMC3 carts that I can turn into devcarts already. Even though I plan on using the PowerPak for development as soon as it's out and I get one, but testing with the actual mapper chip once in a while will not hurt.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">tepples wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">They don't have checking accounts with debit cards where you live?</div>
<br />Can you buy online with debit cards? I wasn't aware of that... I have a debit card, that I don't use for credit (I use someone else's when I need credit), but if you say debit will do... how would I go about buying online with it? And will this work for foreign countries, like here in Brazil, as credit cards do?

<br />Because sometimes one wants to bankswitch at least part of the DPCM bank ($C000-$FEFF). The page you linked sells the parts for CNROM and UNROM, not the parts for a mapper with more than one switchable bank. That would need a 74170 (4-entry 4-bit register file) or 74670 (4-entry 4-bit register file) plus a bit of extra glue logic, as <a href="http://nesdev.com/bbs/viewtopic.php?t=2669" class="postlink">I have illustrated</a>, but unfortunately, 74170 and 74670 appear to be out of production.

<br />It has nothing to do with that, just that the retropack has just been out for a week and you need to buy online with the complication this introduce, while you could just buy a crap game at some random market and hope to found the good board (UNROM, SLROM and TLROM are definitely very common).
<br />
<br />And no, you can just debit with a debit card and you cannot buy anything directly or whathever, and I just have a debit card right now. I just send the request for having a credit card to the bank, and don't have an answer yet.

<br />Then it must work much differently outside the United States. In the USA, debit cards have a "VISA" or "MasterCard" logo and a number from the same namespace as credit card numbers. A <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PLUS" class="postlink">PLUS card</a> would have a VISA logo, and a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cirrus_%28interbank_network%29" class="postlink">Cirrus or Maestro (formerly Eurocheque) card</a> would have a MasterCard logo.

<br />When I registered with PayPal I saw no way to indicate that I wanted to pay with debit instead of credit. Did I miss something? I only use debit, because I also wouldn't trust myself with credit.
<br />
<br />In the US, when buying in a physical store with a debit card, do you need to type the password to your banking account? If so, how can PayPal get your money without those numbers? Just trying to make sure debit cards work the same, because here in Brazil, every time I use mine I have to type my password.

So if I use it somewhere and they don't require a PIN, they have used it as a credit card (or rather, they use the standard credit card transaction handling systems, but it still deducts from my account immediately).
