<br />Which leads to a nice way to unify the two using the breakpoint system. A "tintpoint" would be like a breakpoint, but instead of stopping execution, it would set the tint bits when it triggers.
<br />
<br />EDIT: I thought of "soundpoints" too. These would be useful not only for debugging but also for making an All-Stars-style enhanced remake: mute the NES's sound and put a read soundpoint on each sound effect's data and each music sequence.

<br />
<br />Which, I *think*, is equivalent in most respects to the run-time interface via the IDE, which allows you to set a marked region of code -- aka "tintpoint" -- the only difference being the color used to represent the change of state.

<br />Exactly, except the parallel with breakpoints might help people understand it better, and it would also allow setting color on events other than execution at a particular address. Breakpoint, tintpoint, soundpoint, logpoint, savepoint, scriptpoint, cedarpoint, it's just an idea for making your debugger engine more <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthogonality#Computer_science" class="postlink">orthogonal</a>. It separates the "when" (e.g. opcode fetch, read address, write address, write particular data at address) from the "what" (stop execution, set the color, play a sound, write the registers and a bit of text, save a state for later analysis, run a Lua script, ride a roller coaster).

<br />
<br />I see.  So in other words add a "Do this when hit..." to the Breakpoints dialog, where the list of things to do includes one (or more) of:
<br />
<br />Break
<br />Mark
<br />Save
<br />Execute Lua script
<br />
<br />Makes a lot of sense, thanks!

<br />
<br />I understand everything but the "sound" aspect.
