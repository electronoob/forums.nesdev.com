But 2 pages of RAM may be to much to spend on this. If you can spare the space, go for it, but normally I'd suggest you increase the metatile size (to 32x16, for example, wich can be very handy when it comes to attributes) so that 2 screens will fit in only one page.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"><br />If I did this, I'd want arrays to represent columns, you know? I think I explained this in another thread to you, it might have been like the "Level designing" one.

I think it'll be almost the exact same as the screen. I think I'll scroll in RAM as I'm scrolling the screen. So when the scroll is #$00, read $300-$3FF, and when it is #$10, read $310-$40F, when it is #$20, read $320,$41F, etc. Does that make sense? Are any of these ideas good?<br /></div><br />I didn't quite get what you said here. One page equals 1 screen, right? So, every time you complete 256 pixels of scrolling, that means you have to load a new screen, over the one that you just left. So that the process of loading a new screen does not slow the game down, you could limit the number of objects you decode per frame.<br /><br />If I were to use an object-based level, I'd probably divide it up in screens (as you do with the "objects can not cross to the other name table" rule), each having a 2-byte header: 1 tells wich metatile to use to clear the screen (so that the screens can have different "moods" without you having to define many objects for that), and the other tells how many objects compose the screen. Then each object would follow, with a byte specifying it's type, and another used to specify it's position (4 bits for X and 4 bits for Y).<br /><br />When you load a new screen, use the "clear" byte to fill the screen. Then you draw the objects over it, in small groups each frame, until the whole screen is up. Clearing 256 bytes may take a while, but there are ways to speed it up, such as partially unrolling the fill loop, wich is just a bunch of STA's.<br /><br />Anyways, these are just ideas. They are not rules or anything.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=95">tokumaru</a> — Thu May 11, 2006 11:06 pm</p><hr />

Oh hey, I suppose I could use the same 256 byte section in RAM for updating the screen! I'm going to have to update the whole thing each time I scroll 16 pixels over, though, and that'll really irritate me. How should I do this? I have my objects set up so you can never have half of one object on one nametable and the other half on the other. I'd maybe want to use more bytes that represent what is about to be stored on screen. I could write objects in metatile form to $300-$4FF that would be what's on screen, and what's offscreen.

Celius, there is no problem at all in decoding metatiles. You just have to do it before VBlank, and store the results in a buffer. A full column of 15 metatiles will decode to only 60 tiles (60 bytes), so that's no problem.<br /><br />When you know a column is to be rendered (camera moved 16 pixels), you read the metatiles from the map you use for collision and stuff, and decode them to the buffer. Later, during VBlank, it's just a matter of direcly copying those 60 bytes from the buffer to the name table. 60 bytes is a fairly safe ammount of data to write.<br /><br />By using buffers, the first version of the screen drawing routines I wrote was able to update 2 columns of tiles (1 column of metatiles), 2 rows of tiles (1 row of metatiles), update attributes, do sprite DMA, and the rest of the time was alternated between updating the palette and erasing background tiles that needed to be cleared. All within standard VBlank time (no tricks). Of course, I used a bunch of LDA's STA's, with no loops and very little logic, and the whole drawing code used like 2kb.<br /><br />The key here is: you have to learn how to use buffers, or else you'll always be terribly limited by VBlank time.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=95">tokumaru</a> — Thu May 11, 2006 8:31 pm</p><hr />

Okay, so, I'm thinking of completely rewriting my routine, using the same ideas, but I'm going to have lightning fast updates. I'm trying to make an NROM sidescroller to help me learn how to not waste space. I am already going to have $100 bytes in RAM that represent the meta tiles on screen to check for collision and whatnot, so this is looking a little tight. I'm going to have my objects in PRG layed out in raw, not meta-tile form. So this:<br /><br />80, 80, 80<br /><br />in not meta tile form would be this:<br /><br />80, 82, 80, 82, 80, 82<br />81, 83, 81, 83, 81, 83<br /><br />It's for lightning fast screen update, because a meta tile decoding routine (If you don't know what I mean, I mean like a routine that turns $80 into $80,$81,$82, and $83) in your NMI is just a disaster waiting to happen. I would have a meta tile decoding routine store all the individual tile IDs in RAM, but I don't have enough space in RAM, and when I think about it, what the heck is the point? Just have your objects in PRG in non-metatile form, because there's no real reason besides saving PRG space to have them in metatile form. But it takes alot more time to process, and I wouldn't have anywhere to put the individual tile IDs anyways.<br /><br />Have your Object Address, X/Y dimensions of object, and PPU pointers in RAM. Access those in the NMI to store your object (in non-metatile form) on the screen really fast. I think Columns would be a lot faster, but a lot more complicated to keep track of. Do you know what I'm saying?<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=138">Celius</a> — Thu May 11, 2006 6:03 pm</p><hr />

NMI trips at the start of VBlank -- then you have 20 scanlines (about 2273 cycles) to get all your drawing done.  If you write to $4014 for sprite DMA (which you should do every frame, or at the very least, every other frame) then you lose 513 cycles (which is how long the DMA takes).<br /><br />Time is short in VBlank.  This is why you must have everything ready to draw and totally spelled out by your game logic... so the NMI routine can just see what it needs to draw, and quickly draw it.<br /><br />If you finish all your drawing before VBlank is over, you do NOT have to turn the screen off.  You can leave the screen on, it won't be a problem.<br /><br /><br /><br />Note that actual OAM can only be written to in VBlank (or screen off) -- but your dedicated page of RAM to hold sprite data (which you'll later DMA to OAM) can be written to at any time.  So moving sprites and whatnot can all be done by game logic.  That way... all your NMI routine has to do is copy it over via DMA.<br /><br />The idea is, you want to have OTHER things ready-to-draw like that too.  The NMI routine shouldn't have to "figure anything out"... that takes too long... VBlank time is too short.  Game logic should have it all ready (like it does with the sprite page), then the NMI routine can just copy the needed stuff to the nametables/palette/whatever needs to get done.<br /><br />If you're updating APU stuff in the NMI routine as well -- don't do it until AFTER you're done with your drawing.  APU stuff can be written to any time, it doesn't pay to waste precious VBlank time with APU code.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=33">Disch</a> — Thu May 11, 2006 5:07 pm</p><hr />

Thanks for your replies!<br /><br />It seems very untimed and inaccurate, the way I'm doing it. I was wondering if any of you knew how to update the screen without the turning off of the screen being so noticable. Because my engine currently stores whole objects(a series of meta tiles, not just a metatile) on the screen when updating is called for. And you always need to turn off the screen when writing to it, or so I understand, so how could you do this without it being noticable? It is possible, I know, because every game pretty smooth with it's updates, like SMB1 and stuff.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=138">Celius</a> — Thu May 11, 2006 4:20 pm</p><hr />

<div class="quotetitle">Bregalad wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"><br />Sometimes you would even have two levels of buffering. Buffers make programming SO much easier !<br /></div><br />That's so true. While designing the format of the levels in my platform engine, I came up with a pretty nested format. Tiles were indexed by metatiles that were index by blocks, that were indexed by structures that were indexed by screens that were indexed by the level map. This allowed for very compact maps, resulting in bigger levels.<br /><br />The first design of a decoding routine worked directly on screens, outputing the tiles to be rendered during the next VBlank to a buffer. That routine was madly complicated. And it took more than 1/4 the frame to execute. If by any chance the game was to update a row and a column of metatiles, I'd surelly miss a frame.<br /><br />In the new design, the screens are decompressed up to the block level as soon as the player enters them. With 32x32 pixel blocks, 4 screens fit into 256 bytes of RAM, wich is easily indexed. All collision is performed against these blocks, wich also made everything easier. The actual rendering routine has only a few steps left until it reaches the tiles, and everything is much much faster than before.<br /><br />So I agree that breaking bigger tasks into smaller ones through the use of buffers is definatelly a good thing.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=95">tokumaru</a> — Thu May 11, 2006 10:53 am</p><hr />
