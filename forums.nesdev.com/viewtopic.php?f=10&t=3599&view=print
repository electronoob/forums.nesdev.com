		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I have a question about using Sprite #0 for split screen side scrolling (horizontal scrolling)
<br />
<br />I have what looks like workng code, but I see a small graphical artifact along the right edge of the screen on the same scanline as my sprite #0 is located.   (I am using Nintendulator).  My sprite #0 is a horizontal line of 6 pixels (1 pixel in height) , and the artifact resembles a missing region of pixels. (1 pixel high but the width varies up to 6 pixels)
<br />
<br />Is this considered normal (acceptable) since I believe the rightmost tiles are not normally visible anyways, or am I missing something fundamental in my split screen routine.
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />Basically here is all I do in my NMI to handle split screen
<br />
<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">nmi:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; ; store A,X,Y on stack &#40;omitting code here&#41;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; lda $2002&nbsp; ;reset latch<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; lda #%10001000&nbsp; ; the nametable with my status bar at the top<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; sta $2000<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; lda #$00 ; reset scrolling <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; sta $2005<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; sta $2005<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; ;do sprite DMA<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; lda #$02<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; sta $4014<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;; now wait for sprite #0 hit<br />&nbsp;:&nbsp; lda $2002<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;AND #%01000000<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;BNE :-<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;; sprite #0 was hit, now wait for hblank<br />&nbsp;: lda $2002<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;AND #%01000000<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;BEQ :-<br /><br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;; Now adjust the scroll values nametable for the area below the status bar<br />&nbsp; lda&nbsp; &nbsp;currentNameTableData&nbsp; ; I keep a variable elsewhere with the active nametable<br />&nbsp; sta $2000<br />&nbsp; lda SCROLL_POSITION ; I keep a variable with the X scroll position<br />&nbsp; sta $2005<br />&nbsp; lda #$00<br />&nbsp; sta $2005<br /><br />&nbsp;; continue with the rest of the NMI...<br /></div>

That is because the flag is clear at the end of VBlank, and that your NMI code finish before that, so you wait the flag to be clear. And then you wait the flag to be set again, when set sprite zero hit occured. And wait for the flag to be clear wait the end of the VBlank, it don't have anything to do with HBlank.

<br />
<br />To avoid glitching at the right side of the screen, make sure the second nametable is filled with transparent tiles in the area covered by the status bar.
<br />
<br />BTW, your sprite 0 code can be optimized if you use BIT:

<br />The sprite I am using is in the middle (horizontally) on the bottom of the blue status area at the top.  I included a screen shot showing the sprite too (although its just a horizontal line).

<br />
<br />After you are in hblank, do your 2005 and 2006 writes.
<br />Write X to 2005, then write x&gt;&gt;3 | (Y &amp; 0xF8) &lt;&lt; 2 to 2006.
<br />Your Y is 32, so you take x&gt;&gt;3 | 0x80.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />You are most likely writing a bit too early to $2005, I just suggest getting the value by writing a small waiting loop and try different values for the timing (I always do it that way, almost faster than actually calculate the value that is supposed to go here, try, note that you calculated it wrong and do it again, etc...). To convert to PAL, you only have to multiply that said value by the fration 15/16. In fact I used to often set my sprite some 8 or so scanline above the point where I change scolling, and wait 8.5 or so scanline before writing to $2005 (trying different values until you find the best one).
<br />Alternatively, as the other guy already said, another approach is to change the horizontal scolling on a blank line where the line is blank on BOTH nametables, so that no matter where the scrolling is changed, the scanline will always be blank and no glitches will ever be visible. This of course works as long as you never touch $2006 to change vertical scrolling.

<br />
<br />I didnt realize that there was "timing" involved.  I knew I had to get a few things done in a short period of time, I just thought I could detect an hblank for sprite #0
<br />
<br />I'll let you know how it goes.

<br />
<br />
<br />For me, I was only planning on using sprite 0 for the status bar, not as a specific sprite to be seen, so for my purposes, this seems to work in Nintendulator for NTSC and PAL.
<br />
<br />
<br />Based on the info provided, my sprite detection portion gets much smaller and more efficient.

<br />Thanks for clearing things up for me about hblank and timing.  I'll keep it in mind for future projects.

<br />
<br />Edit-
<br />  Even though I have it working, I'd still like to understand sprite #0 better
<br />
<br />Here's what I have read, please correct me if I am wrong:
<br />Most of this is from NES Architecture document 2.6 dated Jan 2005.
<br />
<br />
<br />1) Sprite #0 must intersect the background on a pixel where neither the background or the sprite is using color index 0 (or a multiple of 4)
<br />
<br />2) (I did not get this from the above mentioned document) The sprite/intersection must be at least 2 contigous pixels. Meaning I cannot simply make my sprite #0 a single pixel in size, and I cannot make it just 2 pixels with a space between them.  (I am pretty sure this is wrong.)
<br />
<br />3) Bit 6 of $2002 is set when the first intersected pixel intersection occurs.  (so this already contradicts #2 above)  It doesnt go down until the PPU starts refreshing the screen (I have no idea what "PPU starts refreshing the screen" means). Does it mean when it gets to the next sprite, next scanline, next vblank, etc..
<br />
<br />4) Reading from $2002 has no effect on bit 6 (Hit flag)
<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />Note #3 basically means that it clears the hitflag on scanline #0.  (otherwise it would stay on all the time)

<br />If you want to wait until the screen reach where the sprite zero is, you have to wait the flag to be clear, then wait for it being set again. You can also, for any reason, want to have a VBlank with variable lenght, but still synch to the screen to do some timed code (from rendered scanline 0) to do some graphical effect. If you want to do that, just wait the flag to be clear. Then it doesn't really matter where sprite #0 is, it just matters that it is somewhere and hit with the background at least one time.
<br />
<br />1, 3 and 4 sounds right. 2 definitely sound wrong, however, you should also note that if the hit happens only horizontal posistion 255, the hit will not be taken in account ! (or something like that)
<br />
<br />I remebered W&amp;W3 used a 1x2 pixel sprite (that's 2 pixels vertically) but I'm not that sure right now.
