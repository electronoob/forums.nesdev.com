We're going to probably need a byte of that for maskROM data pointer/sizing.<br /><br />I'm sending the Famicom cart (<a href="https://forums.nesdev.com/viewtopic.php?f=9&amp;t=9449" class="postlink">Family Trainer 3: Aerobics Studio</a>) to a MESS developer to get the maskROM PARCOR-encoded data dumped.<br /><br />To be conservative with these two bytes, I'm suggesting that <strong>Byte 14</strong> be the amount of &quot;X data size&quot; banks of maskROM data is after CHR data.  Before we &quot;jump the gun&quot; I'm going to see how big the maskROM dump is before we decide the bank size value.  The next step after dumping Family Trainer 3's maskROM data is to move onto the <a href="http://wiki.nesdev.com/w/index.php/List_of_games_with_expansion_audio#NEC_.C2.B5PD7756C_.28Jaleco.29" class="postlink">Jaleco carts</a> to dump those.<br /><br />The MESS code library has the emulation available for the Jaleco carts' ÂµPD7756C variant.  We'll have to do some RE and research to get the Family Trainer 3 M50805 PARCOR decoder emulated.

This concept was also used by Disch's <a href="http://wiki.nesdev.com/w/index.php/NSFe" class="postlink">NSFe</a> format.<br /><br />Basically every thing you append is a &quot;chunk&quot; with some sort of identifier (e.g. FOURCC) and a size field, followed by the specified number of bytes. Order of chunks doesn't need to matter, and chunks of an unknown type can be skipped by the emulator, so you can add new chunk types without any need to update the base format or worry about breaking backward compatibility.<br /><br />With chunks people could also embed other metadata (e.g. what controllers does this game expect, what's the board name, etc.) without really having to have an argument about whether it needs to take up precious space in the header.

You could always hack these games instead to use this method to play the sounds (after recording them and converting them) <img src="./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" /><br /><br />I think it is unlikely that someone would use a speech chip in a homebrew, but if they did we would probably have to assign an iNES 2.0 mapper to it.  We have plenty.

Someone else would probably care about it though!<br /><br />An extensible format means it's possible for people to add new bits of data they have a use for without having to play some political game of deciding whether it's important to be part of the format or not. Anybody that thinks it's important can pick it up and add it, anyone that doesn't can ignore it without changing a single line of code in their emulator.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">lidnariq wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">I mean, UNIF, MAME/MESS format, and byuu's thing are over there. I see no need to recapitulate that argument.</div><br />All of those format arguments indicate a <em>large desire</em> to include other information in the file that maybe <em>you</em> think isn't important, but other people do. The whole reason I suggested chunks was to <em>avoid argument and arbitration</em> about what can go in the file-- it makes it very easy to ignore anything you don't care about!<br /><br />It even makes it easy to write a tool that can just strip out metadata types that you don't like from your ROM collection.<br /><br /><br />Anyhow, the reason I suggested it is that it's very easy to implement, simple, practical solution to a general problem that seems to continually arise. This thread is maybe narrowly about one specific case of that problem, but I'm certain it will keep coming up. I don't really understand the downside to it (?), so it's a serious suggestion on my part.
