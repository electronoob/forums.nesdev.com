The real question I should have probebly asked would be if you would welcome a n00b like me (I dont know anything about NES beond hacking roms) and teach me anything. Hacking roms is fun. Normaly you will find me to be, well sorta out of it you could say. I have a tendancy to, think about the universe in various different prespectives and reflect on it as I write a post. At least untill something stupid slips through the holes in my thought patterns.

<br />Hmm, well to be completely honest I don't post a lot here (nesdev, in general, except for a nsf request... "Sqoon"), so everyone's thoughts about me is probably, unless otherwise: "mildly intelligent/mediocre commentator." This is probably what everyone thinks about n00bs in any kind of forum, unless if you do something that would make them think you are immature... or if they overthink your comment/thread. 
<br />
<br />I just think you gave the visitors to this thread too much freedom [in the voting, that is], and from the looks of it anyone would like to see something more productive from you than just hanging around the "General Stuff" area and asking for an opinion from an anti-noob audiance.
<br />
<br />To tell you the truth, I would very much like to see these hacked roms (if you don't mind, that is). I am trying my best to understand the basis of starting a rom of my own, but I just can't find what I need to make a rom. I won't dare ask that kind of question here (as what I've learned form the 2a03 forum, posting something that doesn't have to do with the subject can make a lot of people angry). I'll just ask it in some sort of "new to creating roms" thread... if I can find something like that here <img src="./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" />. Can you link your roms from somewhere I can download? If you don't have a website, make a freewebs and link it off of there (and if possible, try to see if you can tell those that go to your website how you did it. If you go to my website, I show how I make nsf's along with the proper software to do so... I don't know what else to do with them, but oh well).
<br />
<br />Well, that's my two cents.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I would be glad to give some of these roms. But sadly I accedenly turned one into a virus and it destroyed everything. My wife killed me for it(lost tax records and busness recorsd and all kinds of crap). I mainly attribute this to the technique I use to actualy hacking the roms. By carefully studieing the code as it changes in the ram from the time its first loaded to the time its writen to the sram and when it reloaded I can kinda 'read' what it says. So I can 'ajust' the information in the rom useing ResEdit 2.1.3 and Forker 2.1 and eventualy I can do as much as rewrite storie or game text as well as change the way sprites are deran on the screen(Its really hard to play mario if all the sprites are being drawn in one square on the screen) But this technique also can yield a result of a virus. But I never really understood how excataly this prosces worked. I dont know anything else beyond that is beond what I know.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Since I got my first Mac in 1992, I've backed up my files using the following methods:
<br />
<br />* 1.4MB floppy disks, <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0133093/quotes#qt0105443" class="postlink">and lots of them</a> (my 210 MB hard drive took around 150 floppies, filling two huge cases, and incidentally using the Retrospect software tepples mentioned)
<br />* 100 MB zip disks
<br />* 650/700 MB CD-Rs
<br />* 1GB external Jaz drive
<br />* 2GB external hard drive (what I currently use)
<br />
<br />The trick is to keep unique data you've created separate from mass-produced data (anything downloaded or installed) so you can backup a minimum of data. Also make periodic "final" backups that you never erase or modify, in case your main backup becomes compromised with bad data or accidental deletion of data.

<br />Well lets see 1.44MB floppys were all that was availible at the time and with the HDD that would mean about... 3062.5 floppys? (4GB HDD) and to backup the unique data... Its still 1000 Floppy disks(aprox. 1GB). Of couse this is all anciant history now there is nothing that can be done about it. I will regain my foot hold onto hacking then should I let you know what I have made? (No viruses though)
