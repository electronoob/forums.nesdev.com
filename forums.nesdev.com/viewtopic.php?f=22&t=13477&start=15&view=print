We have tons of topics where people ask &quot;Is this, this and that possible?&quot; with answers like &quot;Yes, if you use the MMC5&quot;, so this is only natural. I know I really wanted to use the MMC5 at one point.<br /><br />My opinions about mappers changed a lot as time passed. Being obsessed about complexity didn't get me anywhere, and the more I'm able to simplify things, the closer I think I am to reaching my goals. Aiming for simplicity doesn't necessarily mean dumbing things down or giving up features though, it's more about asking yourself questions like &quot;do I really need this?&quot; or &quot;is this the best way to do this task?&quot;. Sometimes we assume that one particular path is the way to go, and the stubbornness to remain on that path prevents us from making as much real progress as we'd like.<br /><br />I started making a game for the MMC3, which is what a lot of iconic NES games use, but now I'm fairly happy with the incredibly simple BNROM mapper. In retrospective, the only significant thing I had to give up was the scanline counter, which was only really necessary for a couple of non-essential visual effects, which weren't really worth the complications of using a more advanced mapper. I can still have some of these effects, using sprite 0 hits, sprite overflows and timed code, so I got over that pretty quickly. Everything else from the previous design is intact, even if implemented a little differently.<br /><br />I simplified things a lot on the engine side too... Previously I believed that I'd only be able to max out the VRAM update capabilities of the NES if I used dedicated NMI handlers and update routines, but recently I was able to come up with a very optimized general VRAM update method, which can be used for the entire game. I literally replaced 20 subroutines with a single one, which is slightly more complex than the average subroutine it replaced, but still, it does the job of 20!<br /><br />It frustrates me a bit that I was never able to accomplish anything significant in the field of NES development, so hopefully this new line of thinking will get me somewhere sooner. I am making progress faster than I used to, and what I'm creating does feel more robust and stable, so those are good signs.

It will likely take years to develop so I'm not in a rush to put in on a cart.<br /><br />I am converting my MMC3 to MMC5 and I figured out bank switching but not sure how I write one of the 16384 tiles to the nametable. After that is figured out, I think I'm off to the races.

From what I'm reading here...<br />&quot;The MMC5 has an 8-bit incrementing IRQ counter that watches the PPU as it renders, and counts each passing scanline. When the counter reaches the desired IRQ scanline (specified by the $5203 register), it signals an IRQ. It also uses an In Frame signal which can be read from $5204.6 in conjunction with the 8-bit counter. Games can use this signal as an indication of whether or not the PPU is currently in rendering time.&quot;<br />Regarding $5204:<br />When set, the &quot;In Frame&quot; signal specifies that the PPU is currently rendering a scanline. It also plays a role in how IRQs are generated.<br />The IRQ Pending flag may be raised even if IRQs are disabled.<br />Any time this register is read, the IRQ Pending flag is cleared (acknowledging the IRQ).

That would look great for a football field, the field goal would have to be made out of sprites though. I assume raster splits are difficult on the NES due to the lack of HDMA or a scroll table?
