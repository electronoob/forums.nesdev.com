Yes Bregalad, you're right, there would be a distortion to the shape of the map on a 3D Torus. (I suppose it could be a 4D Torus just fine though.)<br /><br />What I meant is that it maps <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homotopy" class="postlink">smoothly and continuously</a> to a torus. Things may be squashed or stretched, but any local point is connected to the correct points around it and in the correct orientation.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=5165">rainwarrior</a> — Sun Jun 17, 2012 10:44 am</p><hr />

@rainwarrior : I thought a little more aobut it, and unfortunately mapping a 2D wrapping map on a torus is not really possible.<br /><br />If you consider a torus, you'll have to admit the inside diameter is always smaller than the outside diameter. Therefore, when "unwrapped" to 2D, a torus world would not be completely recangle, but a curved shape.<br /><br />You could approximate the fact the outside diameter and inside diameter are close enough only if the main diameter is much larger, that would translate in a 2D map that has the shape of a very long rectangle (either vertially or horizontally).<br /><br />If the 2D map would be a square, or close enough, it'd be impossible to map on a torus because this means the main diameter is equal (or very close to) the torus diameter, and therefore the "hole" in the middle of the torus is completely filled. But then the "inisde" diameter is equal to zero, and this is a contradition.<br /><br />Sorry if I'm not using the appropriate terms, I hope you get the idea.<br /><br />Still the idea of a torus shaped planet sounds cool.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=38">Bregalad</a> — Sun Jun 17, 2012 10:35 am</p><hr />

I didn't mean that King's Quest was spherical (it is not). I just meant that if you have discrete screens without having to make smooth transitions then linking the screens together as a spherical world is not too tricky to pull off.<br /><br />At its simplest you could have a cube world with 6 screens. 4 of the screens would be the sides and link together intuitively, and the 2 pole screens would link to the top/bottom of the 4 sides from each side.<br /><br />Since it would be 6 static screens, each of them could be a proper view of the sphere from one axis-aligned direction, and when you walk off the edge of this view's curved grid, you swap screens and end up at the appropriate location on the next view's grid. It would be pretty intuitive to get around on, I think, even if the rotation ends up being weird at the poles.<br /><br /><img src="http://www.johnzerning.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/Fig_1_geodesic_grid_shell.jpg" alt="Image" /><br /><br />Actually, if you made four versions of each side (for each 90 degree rotation) you could make every transition entirely intuitive (i.e. exit on the right, appear on the left on the next screen).<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=5165">rainwarrior</a> — Sat Jun 16, 2012 7:53 pm</p><hr />

Maybe it would have to be like 3-D WorldRunner or Cosmic Epsilon... and rely on sprites.<br /><br />I thought of the way that is apparently used in King's Quest as you have described it, rainwarrior. It's cool to hear of a game that actually has a spherical world, unless I am misunderstanding. <br /><br />The split scanlines thing sounds pretty exotic, it would be a cool thing to show off.<br /><br />I think fluid motion would probably be a higher priority than accuracy, maybe, if there has to be that kind of tradeoff. The aim is to have something somewhat immersive.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3993">RLError</a> — Sat Jun 16, 2012 4:53 pm</p><hr />

Not very common in games that aren't using a full 3D representation of the sphere (I don't know of any). Even Civilization IV just made the poles impassible and treated it as a cylinder.<br /><br />You could maybe split scanlines between tiles, so that as you traverse left and right, rows closer to the poles scroll slower than the row you're on, closer to the equator scrolls faster (store the world as rows of variable length). Visually stuff at the sides of the screen will look misaligned, though, but maybe you'd be willing to live with this for the sake of a spherical map.<br /><br />You could maybe do it like a King's Quest game, where you get static pages, and just link them like a sphere would be linked. You'll have points, like at the poles, where going "west" should link to the "north" side of the screen below, etc. but that kind of thing is unavoidable.<br /><br />You could probably even do some low resolution 3D rendering on the NES, maybe a bit slowly though, and there'd be a ton of rough aliasing. It would be difficult to do collision reliably.<br /><br />If your world can be a boring plain sphere with all points of interesting being sprites, you could do it okay, since this should permit rotation (of the sprite positions, not the actual sprites) without too much problem. e.g. something like worldrunner could traverse a sphere (excepting the checkerboard ground).<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=5165">rainwarrior</a> — Sat Jun 16, 2012 3:13 pm</p><hr />

But Final Fantasy II's overworld isn't a spheroid and the map doesn't function in real time.<br /><br />Edit: It doesn't matter if it looks like you are on a curved surface. Just that it is an actual globe, rather than a torus. An imprecise way of rendering it might be fine.<br /><br />An "overworld" that is on the surface of a globe gets weird because it won't neatly wrap from one edge to the opposite edge like the square overworlds that we are used to, which only could be mapped to a torus in 3D.<br /><br />Judging from maps that somebody made, it seems that Sonic 3's blue sphere game is played out on a square, that uses an illusion to make it look like a curved surface. I have no idea if the same applies to 3D World Runner or not. My guesss would be that it is a square too..<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3993">RLError</a> — Sat Jun 16, 2012 12:49 pm</p><hr />
