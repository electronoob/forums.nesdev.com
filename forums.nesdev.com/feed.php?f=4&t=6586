Memblers, are you interested in taking pictures of your setup?  With Chip Maestro on the way and with MIDINES still available in small quantities, it would be nice to see this Squeedo Synth blow them all out of the water.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3466">B00daW</a> — Thu May 26, 2011 9:11 am</p><hr />

I haven't worked on this again until just recently, but I fixed a major bug that was causing lots of distortion (when using the 32-byte waveforms).  Now I can apply that distortion in a controlled way, heheh.<br /><br />I've got some ideas of more stuff to post up, but I was curious if anyone has any song requests (game music or not) or specific MIDI files to hear with it.

I've added some more features to the synth, still needs a little fine-tuning (literally!) before I record some new songs though.<br /><br />I've added support for 8-bit PCM samples.  I tried some very basic linear interpolation, which makes it a little less noisy (but not much better).  There's not a whole lot of memory for samples, but I might see how quickly I could load a sample out of external memory when an instrument change command is given.  Right now, instruments are imported from .XI format (FastTracker 2).  The fine-tune setting isn't implemented yet, though, so the samples have to tuned already.<br /><br />I also made a phase distortion synthesis mode, this could sort-of emulate Casio keyboards from the 80's.<br /><a href="http://membler-industries.com/squeedo/Squeedo%202010-09-13%20-%20Phase%20Distortion%20Synthesis.mp3" class="postlink">http://membler-industries.com/squeedo/Squeedo%202010-09-13%20-%20Phase%20Distortion%20Synthesis.mp3</a><br /><br />Next up should be the Yamaha "FM" phase modulation.  I also need to add support for the MIDI drum channel, instead of ignoring it still.<br /><br />All these different modes are able to play at the same time now, selectable for each channel.<br /><br />Other sounds are here: <a href="http://membler-industries.com/squeedo/" class="postlink">http://membler-industries.com/squeedo/</a>, not much to see yet though.  I'll make a board soon, so I can hopefully get it running on the PIC32 soon.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=10">Memblers</a> — Mon Sep 13, 2010 8:29 pm</p><hr />

I'm guessing the RS232 or USB port is involved, but maybe not.  MIDI port?  *clueless*<br /></div><br /><br />Actually, I do want to put MIDI input on this one.  Right now that is what it's doing in the PC version (and using the popular "MIDI-Yoke" windows driver so I can redirect between MIDI ports).  In this setup, it is only getting the notes commands and such as they happen.<br /><br />The first code I started writing for the MIDI part was a General MIDI file parser.  So you could just load and play any .mid file.  But I was running into the problem of having to support (or carefully ignore) pretty much every MIDI feature imaginable before getting to the good stuff.  So I went the easy way and used the 'portmidi' library to filter out stuff I didn't want yet.  I am kind of hoping later to get that working properly, but I'm leaning more towards using a tracker and also hacking it into MCK.  This reminds me too, I was thinking maybe I should get an NES sound emulator working in the PC version soon..<br /><br />The other interface is the parallel port on the PIC, it's a really great peripheral.  It improved a lot on the PIC32, now there is a FIFO (4 bytes, but that's better than none on the PIC18 - a big timing hazard).  But it can just sit on the data bus, and has /RD, /WR, /CE.  Since there is a DMA, kevtris and I were speculating that the NES CPU perhaps could jump to this register and execute entirely off of the PIC.  That could be an interesting way to copy data (since loading with LDA #immediate is fast), or it could also make for some industrial-strength copy protection.  Seems possible in theory, may have issues in reality though.  It should be able to run 4 bytes of code at the minimum, I suppose. <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=10">Memblers</a> — Mon Jul 12, 2010 3:40 pm</p><hr />

Wow, the INC $4011 idea is great.  If you want 44khz sound like the MP3s (those are 16-bit though) then you would doing this about once per scanline, with that optimization freeing up well over 2000 CPU cycles per frame.<br /><br />Today I got the MIDI polyphony working (using some wacky on-the-fly channel assignment / note-stealing stuff), using 24 channels so it's up the General MIDI standard.  4, 8, and 16 channels is more like I was thinking to use on the NES version, 24 channels is a bit much.<br /><br />Bregalad:  For the line-out I would suggest an adapter <a href="http://www.computercableinc.com/ccinc/images/CABLE-Audio-Y-Splitter-2-RCA-Females-to-1-3-5mm-Male-IEC-M7401.jpg" class="postlink">like this one</a> (very cheap if you buy it at the right place).  I think it also should be possible to pass through and mix the regular NES channels on the cart, but of course that still needs the aforementioned audio mod to the NES (or use a Famicom with a modded NES adapter for all these cases <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" />).  It was also thinking it could be fun to hook the NES audio up to the PIC's ADC, and display the waveform while playing NSFs on the actual system, heheh.<br /><br />koitsu:  Back in 2004 or so I had started writing a sound synth to run on the NES, but realized I was quickly running out of CPU cycles and needed an IRQ, I was also designing a game that needed more than 8kB WRAM (and being able to save), so I set out to design a board that would have everything I needed.

On the CHR-side at least, there is one thing that helps out - the CHR (and perhaps nametable) switching can be automated to happen at a specified time, so no interrupt is needed for that.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=10">Memblers</a> — Sun Jul 11, 2010 6:50 pm</p><hr />

1/8 of CPU time is not negligible, but largely acceptable. Also, this could be further decreased by decreasing the sampling rate (haha this makes it even more similar to the GBA to what I first thought).<br />A pair of lda/sta zeropage would be 1 cycle faster than pha/pla, too. Or even better, place the interrupt code in zero-page, and have the sta instructoin overwrite the lda before the RTI, to be 1 cycle even faster (so 2 cycles faster than your solution). Something like that :<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">ZPage_IRQ<br />  sta _saveA+1<br />  lda Squeedo_Audio  ;Hopefully this read acknownledges the interrupt<br />  sta $4011<br />_saveA<br />  lda #$00<br />  rti<br /></div><br /><br />Tepples, your later idea is in fact incredibly clever, but you'd loose accuracy low bit doing that, because it would write two consecutive values. The question is, would this cause any distortion to the sound ? Well after thought, it's very very unlikely a 1-cycle error can give anything audible - so I guess it's really a good solution.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=38">Bregalad</a> — Sun Jul 11, 2010 1:56 pm</p><hr />

It depends on the mixer frequency.<br /><br />All the synthesis is done on the Squeedo side.

If the cart decodes $4011 to a read-only register, can the CPU see it? Because if so, the ISR would execute in only 18 cycles:<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">  /IRQ       ; 7<br />  inc $4011  ; 4<br />  rti        ; 7<br /></div><p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=9">tepples</a> — Sun Jul 11, 2010 1:03 pm</p><hr />

That's whicked !!<br />A line-out on the cartridge would suck IMO it would force the user to use headphones, and prevent the use of the regular sound channels.<br /><br />Other than this it's really exiting. If you implement true looping and non-looping samples (not just a fixed-length waveform) you'll get GBA-style sound (with PSG + wavetable channels). It's be only slightly worse than GBA because it's 7-bit instead of 8-bit.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=38">Bregalad</a> — Sun Jul 11, 2010 9:07 am</p><hr />

Yep, N106 is based on wavetable synthesis as well.  I was inspired a lot by Konami's music for the SCC on the MSX, and stuff like the arcade version of Spy Hunter.<br /><br />I used the IRQ to $4011 method like you said on the original Squeedo, and I still want to do that with this one too.  But, I'm also thinking I will put a DAC on the cart that will require an audio mod for the NES (not like the PowerPak one, but 2 wires for audio in and out).  I'm also wanting a stereo line-out connector on the cartridge as well.. I'd rather use that but I'll have to see how that will work into it.<br /><br />There will be some memory on the cart that will be usable as wave memory.  If the memory was used for nothing but that, you could have over 400kBytes of samples at once.  That could play a lot of MODs, or sound similar to the SNES.  When I get sample playing implemented I'm thinking I'll try grabbing a BRR sample decoder and try playing some of the SNES music MIDIs with the original samples, heheh.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=10">Memblers</a> — Sun Jul 11, 2010 3:02 am</p><hr />
