yes, i understand.. it's for 6502 simulator. i did implement it for nesasm, and all ok. just i keep my tables and code in rom, then i use ram for variables. see you. thanks to you for teaching me any important things<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=296">lord_Chile</a> — Wed Apr 26, 2006 2:46 pm</p><hr />

Hi, lord_Chile! I'm glad to see that you are practicing and all... very good!<br /><br />Just want to say one thing you are doing wrong here. Your code starts at $0003, but so do your variables! If you look in the memory window, the beginning of the code is overwritten by the result of the routine... The simulator allows this, because the code is overwritten after it has already run, but in a real life situation that would be impossible, because you can't define code in RAM (unless you have a routine to copy code from ROM to RAM, wich isn't the case, you're using .org) and you can't have variables in ROM. So what you did there is a little paradox...!<br /><br />Just make sure you separate code from the variables. In your program the variables could easily use $00, $01 and $02, and then program begins at $03, as it already does.<br /><br />When writing NES stuff you'll probably use .org $8000 or .org $c000 for code.<br /><br />Again, I'm really glad you are figuring this stuff out!<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=95">tokumaru</a> — Fri Apr 21, 2006 10:19 pm</p><hr />

That's pretty much it, I'm not against the shift method, but I think the substation/comparison is much more flexible and easily implementable in a game that should convert both huge and small numbers. I'm still waiting the results for 16-bit and 24-bit version of the shift method, it may be faster and may not. And I really think unrolling the loop and stuff is worthless because you'll definitely not convert a lot of number. Optimal and constant timing is much more needed for monster AI or sprite engine implementation, or scrooling engine, and eventually the sound engine (that is typically much more slower when all chanells plays a new note, than if all of them are just disabled and ignored, heh).<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=38">Bregalad</a> — Sun Aug 28, 2005 12:39 pm</p><hr />

Optimizing an algorithm in assembly is the most fun since it involves programming at the lowest level while thinking in terms of very pure math concepts. The <a href="http://6502.org/forum/" class="postlink">discussion forum</a> on <a href="http://6502.org/" class="postlink">6502.org</a> sometimes has some interesting threads along these lines, for example the recent <a href="http://6502.org/forum/viewtopic.php?t=558" class="postlink">"Fast CRC without tables" thread</a>.<br /></div><br />Yeah, I find it very interesting too! However my math skills aren't that great, and sometimes I miss many chances for optimizations.<br /><br />I visit the 6502.org forum from time to time, and they do have some very interesting stuff in there. However, with this subject I wasn't very lucky. They have good ways to perform BIN to DEC conversions, ways that deserve more studying, but most use the BCD mode of the 6502, wich the NES lacks. I don't think people there care much about "modified" 6502's. =)<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=95">tokumaru</a> — Sat Aug 27, 2005 2:08 pm</p><hr />

If anyone is curious, this is the 8-bit routine, unrolled and optimized as far as I could so far. There are no conditional branches, so execution time is constant - around 150 cycles (I say around because there is the set-up, returning and all and I'm never really sure if we should count these in when measuring cycles). I have not bothered to make it as a subroutine yet, I'm just doing things directly for now, for testing purposes.<br /><br />This runs faster than the worst case of Bregalad's routine (only a little bit faster), but still much slower than it's best case.<br /><br />If anyone wants to try, here it is (it is quite longer when unrolled!):<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">BNUM = $00 ;8-bit binary number.<br />DNUM = $01 ;3-digit decimal number.<br /><br />   .ORG $8000<br /><br />   LDA #199   ;Test value.<br />   STA BNUM<br /><br />BIN2DEC<br />   LDA #$00   ;1's start at 0, using the accumulator until the end.<br />   STA DNUM+1   ;Clear 10's.

I'll try to optimize it further, looking for unncessary operations or faster ways to do the necessary ones... putting the lookup table on zero-page may speed up things a bit, but I don't think anyone will want to waste 10 bytes of zero-page, me included.<br /><br />When a 16-bit version is ready, I'll try it against Bregalad's method, also extended to 16 bits.<br /><br />There is one thing I really like about Bregalad's method, though: you could jump to the middle of the routine if you were interested in converting smaller numbers. Both methods are nice, but I'm trying hard to make this one perform faster.<br /><br />-tokumaru-<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=95">tokumaru</a> — Sat Aug 27, 2005 1:48 pm</p><hr />

Worst-case performance is what matters most, because it's what determines whether you have slow-down in a game (unless you can guarantee that worst-case performance of one routine always occurs during the best-case performance of another). For real-time applications, you don't mind reducing best-case performance if it increases worst-case.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=17">blargg</a> — Sat Aug 27, 2005 10:56 am</p><hr />
