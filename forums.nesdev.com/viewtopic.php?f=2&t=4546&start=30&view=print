<br />
<br />Have you figured a good way to redraw only the necessary rows of the name tables? The fact that there are pieces of foreground covering the mountains will probably make this a little harder, because you'll either have to skip them or redraw them. Redrawing is probably easier.

<br />But he doesn't have to ignore everything. He seems to have got good ideas from the discussion anyways, and that's what counts. By now he already knows how to update the tiles and knows that name table updates will be necessary.

<br />With all due respect, I greatly appreciate the posts from tokumaru and tepples, and yours as well. All of the posts here have been enormously helpful, so I have no reason to ignore them.
<br />
<br />It's true that I'm new to <em>NES</em> programming, but by no means am I a novice game programmer; I've been doing it professionally for several years. Even if there was a little bit of miscommunication in this thread (which is bound to happen once in a while), I possess enough experience as a programmer to disregard/modify a suggestion if it doesn't suit my needs. I'm not so easily confused, but if it does happen, I'll be the first one to ask for clarification.
<br />
<br />After taking everyone's suggestions into consideration, I'm well on my way to getting this effect off the ground. You guys really help me to think in new and sometimes unorthodox directions, which is extremely cool.

<br />It's great that you are a professional programmer, you'll be able to teach me how to do boss AI without leading to horrible spagetthi code  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt=":roll:" title="Rolling Eyes" /> (I have terrible trouble with that).
<br />Something tells me that your game will really rock. You seem to be an awesome graphist too. The mountains still looked better originally (without being restricted to 16x16), if you can do that and keep them on 3 tile rows, and use the method I described on my eariler posts with CHRROM, you'd probably get great results. But do whathever you want because you're a pro !

<br />I agree with you there. For now, I'm doing everything I possibly can to simplify the effect in order to increase my probability of success. If I can get vertical parallax to work in the simplest case, I'll gradually add sophistication to the effect until I reach the limits of the hardware (or my ability). So, hopefully I'll be able to support more varied mountains eventually, but I'll worry about that later.

<br />It's exactly the same for me ! In fact I want to master how to do NES graphics and hope to make decent SNES graphics later (because I have more nostalgia for the SNES than NES personally). I don't know how well that strategy will work.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Actually, both the NES and the SNES aren't as nostalgic for me. They are nostalgic, but not as much as other people here, I'm sure. The Gameboy is by far the most nostalgic system for me. Some day I'll learn to program for it. I just really like the NES, and I thought it'd be simpler to program for than other consoles with all of it's limits (I was sort of wrong). One day I plan to move onto the SNES as it's a lot more capable. I really am not so concerned about not being able to make graphics that aren't amateurish as much as I am about making code that I think is running perfectly but since there aren't many debugging tools, there's really some small glitch that will cause the program to completely crash in one spot. Since I've only been programming for about 3 years, and I've only done the 6502 and a tiny little bit of QBasic, I don't think I'm ready to move on to that quite yet.

<br />
<br />You don't need to speak with such a hostile tone. It was just a simple misunderstanding. I wasn't sure either about whether he meant he was going vertically or horizontally.
