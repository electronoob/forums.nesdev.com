If you really mean to load whatever is at $5204, then A will get overwritten with zero. <br /><br />Also, I'm not sure if there's an unofficial 6502 mnemonic for PHX, PHY, PLX and PLY but that would save you three bytes and possibly cycling (like with 65c816) instead of having to TYA or TXA then PHA and PLA then TAX or TAY. I know that SNES ASM has PHX and PLX (not sure for Y) so maybe if there's unofficial 6502 mnemonic you should go for it.<br /><br />EDIT: You also need a &quot;;&quot; for the note &quot;Set $4017 to C0 within rom prep at boot&quot; or else the assembler will not accept that and shoot out an invalid/illegal instruction.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Happen to have a patch we can play around with? Here's a shot in the (relative) dark, though.<br /><br />It looks like $2000 has the wrong value in the incorrect frames in your video like lidnariq said. Your IRQ routine changes the base nametable address through a write to $2000. If another write to $2000 doesn't happen before the next frame is rendered, that frame will be rendered starting from the nametable (and scroll) your IRQ set rather than the one the game used last frame. Metroid appears to run basically entirely in the NMI, and it also seems to skip $2000/$2005 updates during lag frames. (If it's not a lag frame, the game would write to $2000/$2005 after your IRQ and before the frame is rendered. If it IS a lag frame, it skips changing what your IRQ did, so when the frame is rendered it's using those values.)<br /><br />If you've got space, one potential way to partially fix this might be doing this:<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">;NMI Routine<br />PHP<br />PHA<br />TXA<br />PHA<br />TYA<br />PHA<br /><br />LDA $FF;Seems to be a shadow Metroid uses for $2000, assuming<br />STA $2000;Your IRQ code is correct<br /><br />LDA #$C0.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;;vertical position for irq split<br />;ETC. The other stuff you've already got there<br /></div><br />What I hope happens is that the game then renders from the correct nametable, but the scroll is always 0, 0. (In which case, much like how I suggested you rewrite $FF to $2000 at the beginning of your hacked NMI, you'd also need to rewrite the X/Y scroll values to $2005.) <br /><br />I can't say this won't have any side effects since I know nothing about what else Metroid does. But at least let me know if the write to $2000 consistently gets the correct nametable. Or go the whole nine yards and try restoring the scroll values to $2005 as well and see if that works entirely.<br /><br />Edit: And of course, it may not work at all. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_lol.gif" alt=":lol:" title="Laughing" /> Hard to know without seeing it.
