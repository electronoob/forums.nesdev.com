You can't rely on more than about 208 lines being visible on NTSC. The emulated versions on newer consoles scale the graphics down to fit the whole screen within the NTSC safe area.

There is no reason to buffer the input, at least not in any naive implementation. If the output is buffered by your television there could be lag inherent there, but that has nothing to do with the emulation. There is an inherent sound lag due to buffered audio vs. the immediate hardware output, but this is not usually a problem except with very specific types of games.<br /><br />Also, don't use triple buffering, only double buffering. Triple buffering can add 1 frame of lag (it's an option because it can increase performance at the cost of 1 frame of latency).

Try it out: In the arcade version, there is a corner where you can move where the ghosts will never follow you. (At least for about 15 minutes.) Try this in the NES version and you're dead in less than 20 seconds.<br />Besides, the NES version doesn't have the exact same labyrinth layout. It comes closer than any other of the old conversions, so, yes, I would say that the NES version is the best port of all 8 bit consoles, but it isn't arcade perfect.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">lidnariq wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">Why would I jest?

Arcade-perfection requires everything to be the same.<br />O.k., if the image is scaled down, that's something we have to swallow if the arcade version uses a vertical monitor. As long as it's only the output itself that's scaled. In memory, the graphics should of course be at full size.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">tepples wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">Unless, of course, the sprite handling in the original source code is abstracted enough (movement vs. display) that the port team can <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93controller" class="postlink">swap views on top of an existing model</a>.

So, unless a conversion looks exactly like the arcade game, down to the pixel (again, except for conversions for modern consoles where the whole screen is clearly in memory and they output a scaled version of the whole image instead of manually resizing the labyrinth itself, as it's done in the NES version), I would declare it non-arcade-perfect.

If one had 100 ports to check and 25 of them were on Z80-based machines, it would make sense to check the Z80 ones first. It might be that one of the non-Z80 ports was best, but that's the nature of uncertainty: you make guesses based on what you know at the time.
