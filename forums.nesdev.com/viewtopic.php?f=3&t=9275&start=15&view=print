I had previously been using generic text editors (Notepad++ on Windows or Gedit on Ubuntu), and I couldn't figure out how to do these inside NESICIDE:<br /><ol style="list-style-type: decimal"><li>Add a dependency on running a program that converts data into something that gets .incbin'd into one of the .s files. In my current setup using GNU Make, I have certain .o files depending on compressed tile data, and the makefile specifies how to call a Python program to rebuild it. </li><li>Add a dependency on running a program that takes the final assembled and linked .nes file and runs a transformation on it. In a test ROM for a new mapper, I have to make 15, 31, 63, or 127 copies of the first 16K bank and 1 copy of the last bank, with the byte at offset $3FF8 changed to the 16K bank number. This way I can detect powering on in the wrong bank, and I can detect which bank has been switched into a given area. Again, I wrote a Python program to do this, and my current makefile automatically calls it. </li><li>Press Ctrl+F to find something without having to make the window wide enough that the find box in the toolbar is visible. Firefox and Chrome, for example, hide the find box until the user presses Ctrl+F. </li><li>Preserve $0A newlines, as opposed to NESICIDE converting newlines to $0D $0A in any file that it edits. </li></ol><br />I also seem to remember having run into a problem with the sprite address ($2004) apparently being reset to 0 during an OAM DMA ($4014) that extends through the end of the pre-render scanline, even if the DMA is performed during forced-blank ($2001=#$00). I noticed this when the sprite 0 wait in my test ROM wasn't triggering, and a bit of time with the execution inspector revealed that OAM data (including sprite 0) was being overwritten.

I keep stumbling into platform-dependent crap.  Like...on Linux the rule would just call out the name of the external python script and everything would work fine.  But on Windows...well...that's where I get stuck.  So...I can add the *infrastructure* for being able to add custom rules to the makefile, no big deal...but worrying about all the horrors of what happens when GNU Make can't find/execute/whatever the thing in the custom rule just made me put it off...  Maybe I'll just add the infrastructure and we can work out whatever else needs to be worked out one that's in place.<br /><br />RE the find box, I know about that issue but I haven't found a way to force it visible.  Qt is great but sometimes seems to be lacking.<br /><div class="quotetitle">tepples wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">I also seem to remember having run into a problem with the sprite address ($2004) apparently being reset to 0 during an OAM DMA ($4014) that extends through the end of the pre-render scanline, even if the DMA is performed during forced-blank ($2001=#$00).

I think you're right I just unconditionally clear $2004.  I hadn't read anything that stated it only happened if rendering is enabled.<br /><br />1-800-NESICIDE haha.

Moved search bar widget from toolbar to bottom of central editor window to make it more accessible in small-screen environs.

Work on tepples' other suggestions:<br />   a. Line-ending mode.<br />   b. Custom makefile rule infrastructure.<br />2. Implement more mappers!<br />3. Add internal info pages for more mappers (that need them).<br />4. Fix scaling reversion bug.

Feedback, please!<br />2. support in Project Properties (Custom Rules page) for raw-entry of custom makefile rules. WIP...but seems to be useable. Feedback, please!<br /><br />I will start updating the product version in the installer builder [when I can remember!] so hopefully that should make the installation process not require uninstallation of prior version.<br /><br />Note, also, I changed the name of the installer since setup.exe is silly.<br /><br />Regarding bundled installers for CC65 and GNU Make, I would do this but it makes the installer too large to put up on my google project page.  I'm not ready yet to switch back to my domain to serve files from there -- google projects are just too convenient!
