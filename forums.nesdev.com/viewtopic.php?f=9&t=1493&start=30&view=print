But I'd bet these counters are actually used as a binary counter, not just as a jury-rigged quad D latch like Nintendo's use of the 74*161, because <a href="http://tripoint.org/kevtris/mappers/nes_custom/NES_BTR.html" class="postlink">Kevin Horton's FME-7 document</a> mentions a 16-bit down counter used to divide M2 to generate IRQs. </li><li>74*670: Register file that we've discussed extensively in <a href="http://nesdev.com/bbs/viewtopic.php?t=2669" class="postlink">another topic about a conjectured custom mapper</a>. </li><li>74*741: Octal buffer, three-state outputs, mixed enable polarity (to kill bus conflicts?) </li></ul>
<br />
<br />How many CPLDs would it take to fit all these 7400 series chips?

<br />
<br />I think the top left chip is a dual flip flop (74LS74A), not a buffer. Since the PAL doesn't have registered outputs, I can't figure out how they implemented IRQ and mirroring in two bits rather than four. Perhaps they cut one-screen mirroring and the IRQ enable bit (always assumed enabled).
<br />
<br />I really like this pirate's style, too bad they used a PAL for random logic, but I understand where they're coming from, it would probably take another 5+ chips without the PAL exceeding the PCB size and price of the PAL.
<br />
<br />Edit: FME-7 will fit into a XC95108 CPLD if you cut register file bits for 128K PRG / 256K CHR, 256/128 or 256/256 (only if you ignore the bank at $6000), very good to know since it's the largest mapper next to MMC5 AFAIK. I think with a surface mount XC95144 all NES mappers but MMC5 could fit :D

<br />Today that would probably be the case but back then 74 series were cheaper than ASICs (unless you made at least 20k units or so) and FPGA weren't available.
<br />It's in fact surprising a FME7 can be emulated with "only" 13 chips (okay maybe it's simplified). A 74xx version of the MMC1 would take almost about the same amount of chips (about 10 if I remember correctly) unless simplified.
<br />It's also surprising they put the chips so close to eachother. They should have studied how to make they connexions in a very clever way.
<br />
<br />PS : You should add this cart to Bootgods database if pirates are accepted (and I belive they are).

<br />
<br />The fact that someone has come up with a MOD for US NES consooles to play extra audio is it possible to make a MR Gimmick repro that has full sound now. If so would it require the (J) ROM or does the (E) ROM have all the info just not the hardware.

<br />
<br />I've never heard of the FME-7 found in Batman RotJ having the Sunsoft 5b extra sound capabilities. Maybe it does, maybe it doesn't. Bregalad was saying exactly this, no one know has looked and said if it is true or not. Maybe BootGod's site has PCB scans that could help.
<br />
<br />The Euro version likely lacks any data or programming for using the extra sound channels as the PAL NES like the US NES doesn't have expansion audio on the cartridge port normally. The game would have been reprogrammed to use the normal NES sound channels only.
