Just look at any arcade machine.</div><br /><br />Although I was kidding around a bit, earlier, I don't see how fingers are any better when it comes to a controller with two buttons. I can instantly press A or B in the way I described. With an arcade machine it is different entirely, as you are standing in way that would make it nearly impossible to use thumbs and you don't have to hold the controller. If my NES controller was glued to a table I would have to use fingers.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I think it's as simple as each individual holding the controller differently based on his/her comfort and what works best for them, and is sometimes situational.  I actually knew a lot of people in my childhood who on the NES would switch to either thumb+index or index+middle when rapid shooting was required (think <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJ4lmAFB7d4" class="postlink">Takahashi Meijin</a> -- and this is certainly what Asaki is referring to, re: precision), but otherwise would use only their thumb.<br /><br />As for me, I've always just used my thumb.  The reason is that the controller feels extremely uncomfortable to hold if I'm using thumb+index or index+middle.  I prefer to hold the controller and not put it on a flat/stationary surface (which is also why I hate those &quot;arcade sticks for home&quot; and hated the NES Advantage.  I hated the NES Max for other reasons).<br /><br />Now as for NES controllers in general, specifically classic/original vs. &quot;dogbone&quot; -- I *very* much prefer the dogbone simply because it fits in my hands easier (I have dainty girl-or-elf-like hands).  The square shape of the original controller made it annoying for me even when I was a kid, and come to think of it, that's probably why the SNES controller was my all-time favourite until the release of the Sony Playstation controller (which to date is still my favourite controller -- the original PS1 / grey controllers because they're lightweight and they lack analog sticks which tend to get in the way of my thumbs for non-analog games).<br /><br />On my PC, I actually use a DualShock 3 controller (hooked up via USB).

I could never figure this out!).  As we all know, the NES only understands 4 directional inputs: up, down, left, and right (and in combination (tepples don't get OCD about left+right being pressed at the same time, STFU)).  They're binary statuses, not analogue, i.e. either you're pressing the direction or not (there is no pressure variance).<br /><br />Then there's the black ring around all of that nonsense, which had directional arrows imprinted in it, which made me wonder if *that* was what you were supposed to press with your thumb -- or press the red disc &quot;against&quot; one of those.<br /><br />It really made no sense and completely destroyed any kind of responsiveness you had to a game because you were too busy sliding a slick red disc around, like a paraplegic rubbing a clitoris.<br /><br />I had a friend who absolutely LOVED the NES Max and he could never explain to me what it was about it that he liked (still to this day).  I figured the &quot;disc&quot; layout might cater to sports games (ex. Ice Hockey, Blades of Steel, Tecmo Bowl, etc.) where diagonal directionals (ex. up+left) were more commonly used (vs. platformers or some shooting games), but that wasn't really the case (I tried it out myself on Ice Hockey and Blades of Steel).<br /><br />I had better precision using an actual D-pad, simply because the tactile response of my thumb pressing against the &quot;tips&quot; of the D-Pad (e.g. feeling thumb pressed against Up, and against Left) provided better mental feedback.  With the NES Max, you lost all of that -- instead all you had was that stupid disc.<br /><br />The ONLY thing I liked about the NES Max was the turbo buttons.  The turbo rate was incredibly fast (it's faster than the NES Advantage with the pots maxxed out) and worked very well.  Everything else on that controller was shit.  The End(tm).
