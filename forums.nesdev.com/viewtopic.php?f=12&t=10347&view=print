		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Hi guys. I have been building a SNES Cart Interface circuit that uses an Atmel AVR (ATmega8515). This weekend I added functionality to Read/Write SRAM. Let me tell you, the SRAM Write routine has been very tough on me. <br /><br />Please check out these specifics so you can see my design.<br /><br />I have /CART Permanently Low (grounded). This is the CHIP ENABLE(s).<br />For the ROM read, <br />1) /READ line low, set it once for the rest of the routine.<br /><br />then in a loop:<br />2) Set Address<br />3) Get Data<br /><br />works great<br />Worked the same for the SRAM Read.<br />I could not do the same for the SRAM <strong>Write</strong><br />I currently have the functionality apparently unextensively tested, TESTED with Super Mario World 16 Kbit SRAM. Works 99%, but the very first byte at $70:0000 will be written as $FF every time. I have tried a number of strategies but nothing works. Any help??<br /><br />Here is my current strategy:<br />1) Set Read/Write both high, Cart LOW (connected to ground). I don't have any more i/o for /CART but I did try for the hell of it and connected it where /READ was for an exclusive Write test. I tried a couple orders of writing with different assortments of positioning for deactivating and activating /CART with /WRITE. nothing solved it.<br /><br />2) Set Data i/o to be output lines<br />3) enter loop:<br />  4) Assign address<br />   5) /WRITE low<br />   6) Get char from UART, puting into DATA lines<br />   7) /WRITE high<br /><br />This works for 99% of the SRAM but like I said, the very first address doesn't budge from erroneous $FF.<br />Before I tried this routine without setting/unsetting /WRITE, I had a couple other error writes, on the first 3 pages of $100 (70:0000, 70:0100, 70:0200 were the only errors at the time). Then I added the code to alter /WRITE every iteration which saved all errors except for the first like I have been saying.<br /><br />I have tried elaborate schemes to bypass this. I tried hooking up /CART to my mcu and a couple different styles of setting it low before/during the writing process. Maybe I didn't find the magic one. Can anyone give me that please? Sheesh. I'm lost without it. I'm determined.<br /><br />I also tried writing first to $70:0001 to possibly &quot;get it rolling&quot; then moved back to $70:0000, but it still wrote the $FF  value to that location. Ugh.. stressed out. Don't want to come here, love solving problems on my own.. However, after ~800 attempts or more, I am here.

	<tr>
		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I think the correct way would be to output address and data, and *THEN* switch /write low, and then back high.<br />Ie. address and data should be valid &amp; stable during /write=low period.<br /><br />Datasheets contain detailed signal timing diagrams. For example, enter your sram part number at <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.datasheetarchive.com/">http://www.datasheetarchive.com/</a><!-- m -->

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Thank you, while you are most certainly right about that, I already have a 100% functional programming, so I would rather not mess with it. In the future, I will take good care of these considerations.
