It was accessed using a block device protocol analogous to that of CompactFlash, just as both GBA and N64 had used seek-and-read protocols to reduce pin count, and the protocol was encrypted on the wire. Nintendo did invest in an OTP memory company called Matrix Semiconductor, but I don't know whether Matrix Memory chips ever ended up used in DS games.

Some of it would be that you'd expect the UV light to be charging and the programming to be emptying/losing something. You say it has to do with the opposite, that UV light depletes the cells of electrons. So then bit rot would be bits turning to 1 as they lose electrons. </div><br /><br />The photoelectric effect strips electrons, it doesn't deposit them.  And as for the bit rot from 0 to 1, that agrees with what kevtris saw in hit rotten EPROMs.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">MaskROMs are still and were in the past more cost effective than EPROM or EEPROM. But nowdays 3DS and PS Vita cards may just contain NAND flash memory similar to SD cards rather than MaskROMs. GBA used MaskROMs, I think Nintendo DS did too, though I think those were serial memories and not parallel. 3DS could still be MaskROMs of some sort. If anybody knows for sure that would be interesting to know. Flash has gotten so cheap so who knows.</div><br /><br />For what it's worth, I work for one of the remaining memory companies and I know we don't make mask roms.  The idea of having a memory company mask out and fabricate ICs for your specific use is pretty insane really considering how DIRT cheap flash is.  I can't imagine even with 3ds quantities that a custom IC could be more cost effective than flash is right now.  Perhaps the small guys like macronix are still offering mask roms though, I can't be sure.  If there were a non-destructive means to open my 3DS games I would.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />INL, thanks for cleaning that up about the purpose of the UV. So that would be a cell with no electrons is actually going to return 1. So as you say, bit rot is actually going to cause bits to become set rather than clear. And then that makes sense that UV light exposure would potentially speed up bit rot. It just seems backwards from how I remember hearing it years ago.<br /><br />Perhaps the info on DS or 3DS is out there somewhere. If either use Flash then in theory it may be possible to reprogram commercial cartridges. Though I'd guess you'd have to unlock them and know some sort of programming process to do it. Poor reliable MaskROMs left in the dust. =(

You never know, they could have easily used flash but then put some logic in to prevent a hacker from doing such things effectively making it OTP.  Or some sort of encrypted key needed for the write command.  If they did use flash I'd guess they tried to protect it to some degree.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />That or use flash and cut off the write enable pin internally. Compare how SL1 works on DS and DS Lite units: if it is not bridged, most of the firmware flash is read-only. That'd even let a 3DS game use the same chip for the game and the save if the save is in the few sectors that don't require the additional write enable.
