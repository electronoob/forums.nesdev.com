Something you posted earlier seemed to suggest that the answer is no, that the PowerPak can only save over existing ones.  If that's the case, this can be annoying, particularly since Nestopia (the emulator I use) compresses the .sav files it generates (and there's no way to turn that off, at least not in the Mac version).

Other emulators typically allow for placing the .sav files in a sinlge folder you chose where you want, but hardly have the option to just place them in the same folder as the ROM. So I always use VirtuaNES for RPGs, and Nestopia for action games.

<br />I can tell you for a fact that the latest version of the SC fw still cannot support FAT32.

It takes an 8KB file, uses zip to compress to ~200 bytes, renames it to .sav instead of .zip, then the file takes up a 4-32KB cluster of disk so no space is saved.  I don't plan on coding zip for nes so the decompression will have to be done manually when copying over the files.  Maybe something like Automator can be set up to do it automatically.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">In theory, FAT32 has variable cluster sizes too. </div>
<br />FAT32 cluster sizes don't change until the volume size is over 8GB.  When I started this the CF docs said 4GB was the physical limit so I don't know how the 8GB cards exist yet  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />

My main concern is that the average end user (which you hopefully will get the chance to sell to) won't know to do this.  One remedy would be to test for compressed files and tell the user if he tries to load one that is compressed.
<br />
<br />You might also want to provide a blank 8KB or 64KB .sav file for end users who don't have emulators to use as a starting point, giving instructions in the manual to duplicate, rename, and load that file to the flash card.

<br />The only limit of the CF interface is the limit of the ATA version it's based on, and that's well over 130 GB (2^28 sectors). As for the save file, you could bundle a Windows based app that searches for all .nes files in a folder, looks at the battery bit, and creates a blank 8 KiB .sav file as needed.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I am curious the cluster size is what windows calls the"Allocation size unit" correct?
<br />this  can be manually set to whatever you like if you format the card under disk management so if the device expects a paticular size and it is differint by defalt such as with a 8gb it would be nessasery to set it manually?
<br />
<br />also when I format a card I usually set this to as low as it can go doing so lowers access speeds because it has to read through more sections but if you have a large amount of small files you can fit a surpriseingley large amount of extra stuff on it because you dont have a waisted large section for the end of each file,it would also probubley be nessasery to stop that for this?

With my gigantic clunky SWCDX2, I use a Kingbyte based parallel port external drive enclosure along with a CF-IDE adapter.  It lets my SNES load ROMs and saves off of a 2GB compact flash card, but I am stuck with FAT16 and no long file name support, so it isn't possible to load every SNES/SFC ROM into one CF card <img src="./images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" alt=":(" title="Sad" />
<br />
<br />Regarding your NES file browser interface, I'd suggest that by default it boots into the game ROM listing and if possible the ROM browser also remembers the last selected game.

<br />I am looking at FAT16 again because it has to be done as a boot rom upgrade, not just files on card.  Hopefully everything will be selling sometime next week!  I will have to edit my posts so the release date estimates are accurate...

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I just watched the demo... it's pretty cool, although I think the file browsing could use some better aesthetics (not major).
<br />
<br />1. There's no point in showing the "/." directory, so I'd filter it out.  The "/.." directory can stick around, although you might want to rename it to something like "(go back 1 directory)" so it's less confusing to those who don't know what "/.." means.
<br />
<br />2. If a file name is too long, I personally think it's better to show the beginning and end of the file name, with an ellipsis (...) in between.  (That's how OSX's Finder shows long names, and it's nice particularly since often the only difference between consecutive entries comes at the end of the name.)
<br />
<br />3. On the options screen (after selecting a ROM), it would help if the name of the ROM (in its entirety if possible) were displayed on the screen.  You may also want an option to go back to the ROM listing (I assume you can go back by pressing B, but it's still helpful for a novice user if an explicit on-screen choice is present).
<br />
<br />4. I counted 29 lines of visible text on the screen.  How much space do you allow for overscan on each edge of the screen?  My TV cuts off nearly two full rows of tiles from the top of the screen and almost nothing from the bottom.  Thus, if the first file listed is within the top 16 pixels of the screen, my TV will cut it off.  Likewise, any graphical artifacting on the bottom of the screen (which I can see in a number of games BTW) will be visible.
<br />
<br />I am very impressed with what I'm seeing.  You have obviously put a huge amount of effort into this project, and I surely hope it pays dividends for you.  The NES has waited too long for something like this to come around, but late is much better than never at all.  Keep it up!
