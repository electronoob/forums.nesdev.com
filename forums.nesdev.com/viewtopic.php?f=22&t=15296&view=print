See you.<br /><br />**UPDATE 07/03/2017**<br /><br />How it was made The Banketh - The Video Game<br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfiNwqP85qw">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfiNwqP85qw</a><!-- m --><br /><br />**UPDATE 08/02/2017** CROWDFUNDING time!<br /><br />You can already collaborate in the crowdfunding of the videogame from Verkami: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.verkami.com/locale/en/projects/17050-videojuego-para-nes-the-banketh-the-video-game">http://www.verkami.com/locale/en/projec ... video-game</a><!-- m --><br /><br />We have 40 days to get a minimum of 3. 500 euros to make this project a reality.<br /><br />The video game itself, consists of the cartridge, box, instructions, and protective case. It has been priced 39 € (shipping costs to Spain included).<br /><br /><img src="https://dg9aaz8jl1ktt.cloudfront.net/uploaded_files/000/115/472/verkami_080e03d9767bf1fe2b591fd23af3d202.jpg?1486051622" alt="Image" /><br /><br />It also offers the acquisition of cup with the logo of RetroNES Software and blue shirt with the cover of the game.<br /><br />But maybe what interests you most is the complete video game pack plus beer <a href="http://cervezaslagrua.com" class="postlink">La Grúa</a>, who will make a special run of his Australian Pale Ale with the video game cover The Banketh in its labeling.

For now I can teach you images of the game and some gif.<br /><br />The game is linear adventure type, but with small details of exploration.<br /><br />It is composed of 5 levels, plus 4 sub-levels that make connection between the previous ones. In this way, the first level is a culvert, the second level is an office, the third level is a park, the fourth level is a cargo ship, and the fifth level is an old street. Between level and level we must mount in a motorcycle and overcome some obstacles to reach the next level. <br /><br />Mutant monsters have kidnapped my four friends and I must go through all Santander in their search, and then exterminate the chief of the mutants. Very simple.<br /><br />Each level has a riddle or secret to discover to be able to overcome, whether keys, buttons or anything else that is hidden.<br /><br />All scenarios are based on locations in the city of Santander (Spain).<br /><br />It is mounted on a UNROM 128Kb card.<br /><br />Programed in C with the Shiru library.<br /><br />I have to create the music. For now I have only been able to create some sound.<br /><br />It also contains some bugs that I still have to solve. Some problem with collisions, etc ...<br /><br />I teach you captures:<br /><br /><img src="http://www.retrones.net/sites/default/files/capturas/game%202016122511.png" alt="Image" /><img src="http://www.retrones.net/sites/default/files/capturas/game%20201612251152072.png" alt="Image" /><img src="http://www.retrones.net/sites/default/files/capturas/game%20201612251152158.png" alt="Image" /><img src="http://www.retrones.net/sites/default/files/capturas/game%20201612251152209.png" alt="Image" /><br /><img src="http://www.retrones.net/sites/default/files/capturas/game%20201612251154145.png" alt="Image" /><img src="http://www.retrones.net/sites/default/files/capturas/game%20201612251153279.png" alt="Image" /><img src="http://www.retrones.net/sites/default/files/capturas/game%20201612251153218.png" alt="Image" /><img src="http://www.retrones.net/sites/default/files/capturas/game%20201612251154436.png" alt="Image" /><br /><img src="http://www.retrones.net/sites/default/files/capturas/game%20201612251156114.png" alt="Image" /><img src="http://www.retrones.net/sites/default/files/capturas/game%20201612251155097.png" alt="Image" /> <br /><img src="http://www.retrones.net/sites/default/files/capturas/qwerty.gif" alt="Image" /><br /><br /><br />The reason why it was relatively hidden was just so my friends did not know anything, since the main objective was to make them a Christmas gift with this video game.<br /><br />I explain a little: The Banketh is a name that means nothing. It is a play on words mixing Spanish and English. When we were very young, we spent a lot of time sitting on a bench in a street near our homes, and sometimes we played the &quot;Spanglis&quot; that was invented words in English with words in Spanish; Simply by laughing a little at how ridiculous those words sounded.<br /><br />In this way, as we were always sitting on a bench, it occurred to us to play the word game with this (in Spanish it is called <strong>&quot;banco&quot;</strong>), and came out <strong>&quot;banketh </strong> &quot;. And since then we call ourselves The Banketh.<br /><br />Today at last, being Christmas, my friends have woken up with the finished gift (lie, it really is BETA 1.3) under their Christmas trees. Some have cried a lot, because they did not expect it, and in general the reception has been very great.<br /><br />The next objective is to fix the problems of the game, create music, improve the sound, outline some levels, and later make a crowfunding campaign ... although the latter I still have to think a lot.<br /><br />Right now there are 5 units that I have created by hand, and it has remained like this:<br /><br /><img src="http://i14.photobucket.com/albums/a305/diskover/15726641_1333868543352365_5262957464403514269_n_zpsvzpjamon.jpg" alt="Image" /><br /><br />A greeting from Santander. I'll go slowly posting the news.<br /><br /><img src="http://i14.photobucket.com/albums/a305/diskover/100_4596_zpsrked93s9.jpg" alt="Image" />
