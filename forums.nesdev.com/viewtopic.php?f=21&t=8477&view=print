		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Ok, after <a href="http://nesdev.com/bbs/viewtopic.php?t=8342" class="postlink">This topic</a> I decided to leave programming(for a while) and improve my pixel art "skillz".It's not a making music, after all(IMO much harder than grafics).
<br />So, here it goes:
<br />
<br />Library:
<br /><img src="http://img855.imageshack.us/img855/5892/moe1.png" alt="Image" />
<br />Inside of submarine:
<br /><img src="http://img3.imageshack.us/img3/5769/moe12.png" alt="Image" />
<br />Forest:
<br /><img src="http://img847.imageshack.us/img847/3920/moe13.png" alt="Image" />
<br />
<br />About library:
<br />There's a room for improvement-I'll can use sprites to fill some books with different colors.
<br />
<br />About Submarine:
<br />Maybe I'll draw some curves at bottom to mak it look smaller.
<br />
<br />About Forest:
<br />All grafics, except wishing well, are from <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8OfMMqSNtQY" class="postlink">The Fantastic Adventures of Dizzy</a> But I consider drawing my own forest.Wishing well was drawn by Micrus for another project, but never used.
<br />
<br />I also consider using black out line for sprites.
<br />
<br />Ok, now for Inventory Item Art:*
<br />Dynamite:
<br /><img src="http://img196.imageshack.us/img196/3650/dynamit.png" alt="Image" />
<br />Umbrella:
<br /><img src="http://img685.imageshack.us/img685/4903/parasolf.png" alt="Image" />
<br />
<br />Yeah, Dynamite is supposed to not have fuse.
<br />
<br />While are at the topic, I'd like to ask about something else.
<br />In the topic mentioned at the start of this one, some people agreed that using ripped grafics is bad.But what about "downgraded grafics"?
<br />Inventory items are traditionally 32x32 in size.
<br /><a href="http://www.pixeljoint.com/pixelart/44976.htm" class="postlink">These</a> items are in perfect size(with few exceptions) looking great, pixel art, and can be downgraded without losing too much quality.
<br />Example:
<br /><img src="http://img811.imageshack.us/img811/8311/bubblerb.png" alt="Image" />
<br />LEFT:Original art, RIGHT: Downgraded for NES.
<br />How do you guys feel about that?(about the act of downgrading some one's** grafics and using it in game)
<br />
<br />*These shows up when you acces inventory(by pressing Select) and are somposed by using background AND Sprites to make 6 color items.
<br />
<br />**Guy will be credited and I'll ask him about permision first, of course

<br />
<br />In the submarine graphics I would work on the gaps between the elements - sometimes there is 1 pixel, sometimes is 2, and sometimes is none. Also, there is inner shading on the ladder, but not on the other things - probably will be better with shading on them too.
<br />
<br />Ripping - using without a permission. If you have the author's permission, is it certainly acceptable, downgraded or not.

<br />
<br />The second looks quite simplistic to me. Almost like something you'd see on a "pre-NES" videogame. 
<br />
<br />The third looks amazing. <span style="font-size: 59%; line-height: normal">Is that with 256 lines still or are you/they using a high rez mode?</span> (wrong, sorry that is SNES).

<br />Very nice graphics for the NES.

<br />On the second pic it's the exact opposite - it lacks some detail. This gray background looks weird, I suggest you should have some repeating pattern instead.
<br />Also I have no clue what those green things are.
<br />
<br />The third pic looks great to me. The sprite looks weird - lacking black outlines - but the BG looks perfect.

<br />Probably because the background "pops" enough that it doesn't look visually any farther back than the books. Changing the gray to dark gray ($00) instead of light gray ($10) might help.

<br />Adding some projected shadows would surely add more depth to everything (i.e. the book cases could cast shadows on the wall).

<br />
<br />Probably, either that or blue <img src="./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" />   People would say "blue-green" before cyan.  In fact I would think the general public wouldn't even know that cyan is a color, let alone what color...

<br />The color scheme of Slashdot.org looked "green" to me until I loaded the logo into GIMP and found it was cyan. Perhaps my expectation was tainted by the fact that it's "news for nerds", and printed circuit boards are traditionally green. And perhaps now is the time to mention a <a href="http://www.cracked.com/article_18823_5-insane-ways-words-can-control-your-mind.html" class="postlink"><em>Cracked</em> article about color names</a>.
<br />
<br />The only reliable color names we have on this board are hexadecimal: $02 is a dark blue, $10 is a light gray, etc.
