lidnariq: Thanks <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /><br /><br /> I have another question though. Composite input should have a 75 ohm load to ground on the receiving side, so transmission should be higher voltage range than what the receiver will decode. While I don't particularly understand the math behind it, matching a 75 ohm impedance cable to a 75 ohm resistor load (a mismatch causes problem), helps remove reflections of high frequencies back into the line(to removing ringing/ghosting/etc). I understand the logic (and how impedance works). What I want to know is, when you view the signal on a scope - should it be under a match &lt;n&gt; ohm load - in that context? Or will the receiver take care of scaling to appling the new voltage levels on its side, and the reference to the composite specifications (sync, blank, peak) are for the signal <em>without</em> the load put on the signal, for the scope?<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3645">tomaitheous</a> — Thu Jan 06, 2011 6:37 pm</p><hr />

Hey Chris. Thanks for verifying that SuperCDROM composite out <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br /> Also, not just s-video out. But component as well. I'm a little wet behind the ears for analog EE, but I pick up things fairly quickly as I move along. The PCE has Y, R-Y and B-Y and separate CB output pins. Since Cr and Cb aren't summed, all I should have to do with build a four diode bridge rectifier to demodulate each of the two lines. Then apply a light low pass filter. The 90 degree phase difference of one of the Chroma out lines won't matter, since it's AM that I'm demodulating at this point. Luma is already there by itself and the IRE level is 0 to 100 (component NTSC-U uses this range compared to composite NTSC-U), so nothing to do on that end. Hopefully that's all I need to do. We'll see how the component output looks when I get some more video amps. (Building the s-video circuit first)<br /><br /> Edit: Also verified composite output from the back pins of my white PCE. It has the same Luma levels as the SGX; 0.0v to 0.84v. So it's not just my SGX (or a specific broken resistor/amp issue).<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3645">tomaitheous</a> — Tue Jan 04, 2011 2:11 am</p><hr />

Yeah, the composite out of the SCD-ROM is darker than the normal CoreGrafx/SuperGrafx, so I never use it.    Good luck on your S-Vid work on the PCE...

Hmm. Seems the Super CDROM^2 addon (the only one directly made to work with the SuperGrafx), has different composite output levels.  Max white is 0.76v instead of 0.84. CB on the back porch is also 'taller'. Not sure if that makes a difference (I'm pretty sure CB is only used as a clock reference to the sub carrier and not an amplitude guide for AM).<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3645">tomaitheous</a> — Mon Jan 03, 2011 11:55 pm</p><hr />

I wanted to start this thread to talk about specific stuff at the moment, but there's still quite a bit I'd like to discuss relative to all things NTSC - as well.<br /><br /> First off is the issue of Japanese game consoles on US NTSC sets. Japanese systems uses the full voltage range from blanking (0v) to max. While US TV sets start black at IRE 7.5. Showing a Japanese console on a US TV basically crushes very dark colors. But what about full white? I keep getting conflicting results.<br /><br /> Some sites list 100 IRE as max white (which is 0.714v from what I've gathered). Other sites give the Luma range in 8bit quantized steps.. 16 to 235. To me, this suggests two things if you map that range into logic of IRE levels; A) 235 doesn't represent IRE 100 or B) it does represent IRE 100 but there's whiter than white allowed (Luma voltage above 0.714v). There's conflicting information about this EVERYWHERE.<br /><br /> Secondly, if NTSC-J starts 'black' as blanking or IRE 0, then what's the cap at? Higher than NTSC-U of 0.714v? The reason I ask, is that looking at my Japanese SGX on the scope - Luma isn't 0 to 0.714 (ignoring sync level). It's 0 to 0.84v. Well, at least that's what the game system is outputting for max white: 0.84v. I has a rom board for my PCE/SGX, but unfortunately not for my SNES and Genesis. And.. both of those are US systems - not Japanese. So I can't run comparative Luma range tests on them.<br /><br /> Any ideas? There are a number of reason I want to know this, but one of them is to make a circuit to scale and offset the composite output into the correct range. I don't want to scale the top level incorrectly if 0.714 != 0.84 in equiv range for JP and US standards. I mean, I want to keep the 'whiter than white' if that is the case for NTSC-J standard too, when transforming this to NTSC-U.<br /><br />Edit:<br /><br />Secondly, NEC didn't bother fixing the NTSC-J issue for the US Duo models. Black is IRE 0. Max white was 1v (!), but I think my amping circuit in my Duo is on the fritz (I've been cutting traces and jumping them ,etc). I'm curious about the NES and SNES. Were these corrected or left as is like the Duo (don't know about the TG16 because I don't have one on hand to test).<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3645">tomaitheous</a> — Mon Jan 03, 2011 11:31 pm</p><hr />
