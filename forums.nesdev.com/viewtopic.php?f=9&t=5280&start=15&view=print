The working ones definitely seemed to work, tests I did were with SMB3 and Double Dragon 3.

But these other ones baffle me...I don't think it could be a mislabel on some of these, as the game appears to work somewhat, albeit very glitched out. The other chips pinout is way too different for the game to even get that far.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" /><div class="quotetitle">Memblers wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">I don't know if we could ever know for sure, but my theory is that all the good chips were built into carts years ago, these were from a known bad batch that was set aside and never used, or were thrown out and someone pulled them from the trash.  I have a hard time believing that that many defects could be normal, but I suppose that's possible too.</div><br /><br />I think that has a substantial chance of something along those lines being the case.  When I first heard about this being a common issue with these chips I had a hard time coming up with a rational explanation for the high rate of defect.  At that time part of me wondered if it was just bad testing practices by whoever was making those reports years ago.  But here you are years later with a separate batch of chips and having the same issue.  I have since gained experience in IC manufacture and testing, knowing what I know now, this really isn't too suprising with NOS.  FWIW I purchased a number of yamaha synths from ebay a couple months back and found only 1 of 5 pcs I purchased actually worked properly.<br /><br />In IC manufacturing parts are practically always tested after assembly/encapsulation because there will always be defective parts during the assembly (wire bond and encapsulation) process.  You have to ask yourself what happens to those parts which fail testing?  If they're deemed unusable all you can really do is toss them in the trash.  If some worker thought they might be able to pull them out of the trash to sell them on a black market of sorts chances are decent that they would have yanked em.  One might wonder, well then why do some of them work?  In testing there are always false failures, and additionaly a part can fail for reasons besides gross functionality.  Perhaps those didn't meet all the timing specs, or they had too high of current consumption based on the spec etc.  And the true failures aren't all going to fail the exact same way, they'll have varying issues which is exactly what you're seeing. More over you would probably expect that ~20-50% of the parts you 'throw away' are functional in practice.  So that gives even more reason to pull them from the trash and have them end up in your hands 20 some years later.  The person/company who sold them to you certainly didn't manufacture them, and they certainly didn't test them.  So if whoever sold them to your distributor pulled them from the trash at some point, you'd have to expect what you're seeing.<br /><br />They're just plain bad parts, not really worth your time and effort to investigate further IMO.  Be happy with the working ones you have as proof that your testing apparatus works.
