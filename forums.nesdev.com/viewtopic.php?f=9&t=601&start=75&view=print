The important thing to remember is that once it leaves the PPU, it should never go back to the PCB.  Keep the lines short and well insulated (and away from any noisy sources!)
<br />
<br />As far as components, everything you'll need can be found on the toaster NES system.  
<br />
<br />As far as transistor.  It's there.  2SA937.   You can remove this part from the top loader and reuse it!  The only component not found on the top loader is the FC2 line filter (found in toaster) but I don't think it's needed.

<br />
<br />So you're saying that the original top loader's circuitry is fine as long as you move it and/or give it better shielding?
<br />
<br />Also, are all of the parts that I need from the toaster located on the inside of this shielded box?
<br />
<br />Edit: Ack...so I'm looking around, and it seems like ALL of the parts I need are on the outside of the box. Oh well. That's what I get for jumping into things without looking first. No harm done, just wasted time.
<br />
<br />They don't seem to match up with the schematic, though.
<br />
<br />Schematic says:
<br />R5 - 300 ohms
<br />C5 - 220 uf
<br />R6 - 110 ohms
<br />C6 - 550 pf
<br />
<br />Parts are:
<br />R5 - 220 ohms
<br />C5 - 330 p
<br />R6 - 47k ohms
<br />C6 - nothing there
<br />
<br />I suppose at least I've got the Q1 and the FC2.

<br />
<br />Actually, you don't even need Q1.  You can reuse the Q1 that's in the top loader.  All you need to do is desolder it and move it to the circuit board you're building.  Some people have suggested you don't even need the FC2, you can go without it.  
<br />
<br />As far as the box is concerned... there's only 2 ways to remove it.  Use a desoldering station or use a heat gun.  Solder + hand pump/braid will never get it off.

<br />A top-loader is region-free, and its Game Pak connector is thought to be more reliable.

<br />
<br />It was a junker I had laying around. Can't get it to work for the life of me...I think someone spilled something in it. I've got another front loader that I've done a Game Genie and region free mod to, but it still doesn't work half as good as the top loader (sans the poor video).

<br />
<br />I was thinking today...if the video lines are picking up too much interference from the power supply, how did the Famicom AV get away with it?
<br />
<br />Also, in preparation, will it be easy to lift out the video pin, or am I going to have to desolder the entire chip to get at it?

<br />
<br />At least he did a stellar job mounting the AV jacks, I can thank him for that. I would've never been able to do that myself.
<br />
<br />Can't wait to get started on this, but unfortunately, I have to go to work =/ Will probably have to wait until the weekend &gt;_&lt;

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Okay, I don't mean to sound stupid or anything, I just want to be absolutely certain that I've got this right before I tear into this thing.
<br />
<br />I'm using Loopy's pic, I'm assuming my dot would be in the same place (there isn't a dot on mine), and I'm assuming this is the PPU, and Nintendo didn't try to trick me by writing "PPU" in the wrong place on the board =)
<br />
<br /><img src="http://redwax.circa1984.com/random/nes2.gif" alt="Image" />
<br />
<br />Do I have to connect the ground directly to the PPU, or will I pick up noise by connecting it elsewhere?
<br />
<br />It's been a while since my electronics classes, C5 has polarity, I don't remember how to check it. I'm trying to do a search online, but I don't see anything useful, and I don't feel like digging out my old books from college. Also, the closest thing I could find is 220uf, but it's 10v instead of 6.3v, will this be okay?
<br />
<br />I have to go to Radio Shack anyway...I can't find either of the two resistors or the other capacitor =/ Don't really feel like running parallel resitors, last time I did that, it wasn't pretty @_@
<br />
<br />On the schematic, what are the pins on Q1? Is that little smudge supposed to be pin 1, and then ground is pin 2, and pin 3 goes to pin 21 on the PPU?
<br />
<br />Oh yeah, I think this is the last question, since I'm pulling pin 21 straight off the board, I'm assuming this means I don't have to worry about the previous modifications made to R3 and whatever else?
<br />
<br />Looking closer, whatever mod this guy did is a little bit different from the one at GamesX, unless he just goofed somewhere. For some reason, R2 is replaced (looks like...430 ohms? Hard to tell what the first band is, unless I'm looking at it backwards...then it's still hard to read).
<br />
<br />Okay, that should be everything. Since 21 is right on the corner, I think I'll just try to lift it out without removing the entire chip. Think I'll be able to manage it without breaking anything.
<br />
<br />In the meantime, I'll look for some spare twisted pair, and maybe if I'm lucky I'll find those resistors.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Hi there!  Hope this helps.
<br />
<br />- ground is ground.  Get it anywhere.  I got it from the shiny parameter around on board.
<br />- You can lift the pin, or you can trace it to the next IC (which should be the on-board amplifier).  You can lift the on-board amp, or remove the resistor next to to the amp.  And then solder the wire to the PPU.
<br />- When it comes to capacitors, the longer leg is always negative.  It should also have a white line printed on the cap on the negative side.
<br />- You gotta find a good electronics shop in your area.  Find out where the local electricians / TV repair people go.  Rat shack sucks and is over priced!
<br />- GamesX reused the on-board amplifier to drive the RCA plugs.  The problem there is that it's still in the same noisy place.  This almost reproduces the on-board video amplifier, but puts it on a separate board that doesn't pick up as much noise.
<br />
<br />Good luck!

<br />Oh wait, I think I see it now. It goes underneath the chip and then winds its way along to Q1.
<br />
<br />The "longer leg" thing is ringing bells now, but since this is soldered onto something, I'll have to go with the line (it has a black line with arrows pointing down). You never said if 10v would be okay instead of 6.3v.

<br />
<br />The important value when it comes to capacitors is the capacitance, not the voltage.
<br />
<br />You can use 25V caps and it'll be find.  What it means is that the caps are rated up to 25V @ xxx uF.  The capacitance must be bang on.  All voltage on the NES is 5V anyways!  Even the 6.3V is off!
