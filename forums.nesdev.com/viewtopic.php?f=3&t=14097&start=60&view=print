But <em>Klax</em> turns out to mix both methods, yet consistently wants +1.<br /><br />Of course we cannot rule out that there are different revisions of the Rambo 1 chip that behave differently. If I understand the Japanese description of that <em>Hard Drivin'</em> video I linked to earlier correctly however, the guy modified a <em>Skull &amp; Crossbones</em> board to put <em>Hard Drivin</em> on it, which speaks against that theory.<br /><br />Edit: And <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/viewtopic.php?p=125092#p125092" class="postlink">this guy</a> of course put <em>Hard Drivin'</em> on a <em>Klax</em> board, so I think we can shelve the the hardware revision theory.

IRQCounter decrements immediately when reloaded via C001<br />3. writes to E000 clear IRQcounter as well, and thus a decrement from zero will also load latch + 1 but this will look like just latch<br /><br />Using these assumptions I got Skull and crossbones and Klax to work glitch free, Hard Drivin has a blue line on the driving sections above the timer, and rolling thunder status bar moves up by 1 scanline when I shoot.<br /><br />Well, not perfect, but maybe it will give someone else an idea.

I suggest the following initial list of things to investigate:<ol style="list-style-type: decimal"><li>Can it be confirmed that under normal circumstances, in scanline mode, writing 0 to C000 and C001 returns in exactly one IRQ being asserted not at the next A12 rise, but the one after that, <a href="http://kevtris.org/mappers/tengen/800032.html" class="postlink">as Kevin Horton describes</a>?</li><li>Can circumstances be found under which writing 0 to C001 and C000 causes the IRQ to be asserted at the next A12 rise after all, and not at the one after that? That's what Hard Drivin' needs. Its IRQ handler that does such a thing starts at PC $FDB4. Circumstances could include the order in which registers are written to, or the timing of the register writes relative to what's happening on the A12 line.</li><li>Does it make any difference whether C001 is written before C000, or vice-versa?</li><li>Does writing to E000 or E001 clear the IRQ counter, as <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/viewtopic.php?f=3&amp;t=14097&amp;start=60#p201455" class="postlink">Alyosha_TAS suggested</a>?</li><li>Are any of the latch value bits written to C000 ignored, as <a href="https://wiki.nesdev.com/w/index.php/Talk:RAMBO-1" class="postlink">Zepper suggests on the wiki discussion page</a>?</li><li>Is the prescaler in CPU cycle mode actually cleared every time when writing to C001, as the wiki claims? Is it cleared even when scanline mode is selected?</li><li>Does anything funny happen when switching from CPU cycle to scanline mode? An earlier version of puNES' source code seems to suggest that when switching form M2 to A12 mode, the next M2 falling edge will still clock the chip even as the chip is already in scanline mode (variable tengen_rambo.irq_force_clock in puNES' mapper_Tengen.c, not in the current source code version, tough).</li></ol>

I'd be willing to pitch in some money towards getting them in the hands of someone who can do some exhaustive hardware testing and pinning down the exact behaviour. Maybe they are slightly different? Maybe the behaviour is still more complicated then we expect?<br /><br />It would be nice to be able to wrap this issue up definitively and move on. This has wasted the time of numerous devs already with inconclusive results.
