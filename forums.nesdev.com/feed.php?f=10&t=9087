I also have the 64M USB SmartCard. It's great. While it isn't as nice as typical EverDrive cartridges, it gets the job done and it's very low cost. When dealing with regular GameBoy games you can fit a good number of games into that 64M capacity. Though the menu, on both sides, will take up 1M I think, so if doing multi games you really have 62M I believe. <br /><br />But it is so cheap, if that or saving is an issue, buy another cart. There is no knowing if or when anyone will ever make a cart that loads off SD and how well it will work or how cheap it will be.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=1726">MottZilla</a> — Thu Jul 12, 2012 9:10 am</p><hr />

Thank you very much for the reply  <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />   I'm really glad to hear the cart IS SuperGB compatible.  That's unfortunate about the saves.  I have a Mac myself and I never have luck running 'Parallels' for Windows startup so I was a bit wary about having to use a Windows app to flash the cart.  I like PCs and Macs, but lack any natural PC ability  <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_confused.gif" alt=":?" title="Confused" />   I think I'm still at the stage where my wife has to help me print yet I can mod my own retro consoles.  Weird.<br /><br />I'm glad to hear others would be interested in an SD Gameboy cart option.  I think it'd be great <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_exclaim.gif" alt=":!:" title="Exclamation" /><p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=5354">I_Am_Error</a> — Thu Jul 12, 2012 8:13 am</p><hr />

I happen to own the flashcart you linked to in your post.<br />It works fine with the SGB. (I own a modell 1 SGB for use with the PAL SNES)<br />About the problem of page-switching:<br />The cart only has 2 ROM pages. In other words, you will likely only have two programs/games on it at any given time. Unless you're planning to switch between them every minute, I don't see why it should be a problem to turn the SNES off and on again. This has worked really well for me so far. There is an indicator LED in the cartridge that shows you which ROM page is currently being used and I never had problems like data loss by cycling through the ROM pages quickly.<br /><br />Now the REAL problem with this cart is that it only has one RAM page that is shared by both programs/games in the two ROM pages.<br />This is really annoying, because every time you want to use a different game or program that uses the RAM it will overwrite the data that was saved before.<br />So you'll find yourself connecting the cartridge to the PC really often just to dump the RAM contents.<br />Luckily for me, someone has written a program for Linux to access the cartridge from this system. I would personally hate to use Windows everytime I wanted to dump the cartridge contents or flash a new ROM-file (happens really often as I said).<br /><br />There's only one other GB flashcart, that I know of and it has not yet been released to the public.<br />This is the creator's blog:<br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://mafipulation.org/">http://mafipulation.org/</a><!-- m --><br /><br />Read up for yourself if you want. I personally don't see any advantages over the EMS flashcart that I own. Since I have to dump saves so often, I don't care if my RAM needs to be battery-backed or not.<br />I don't know of any flashcart for the GB that uses SD-cards or something like that. It would be great to have those around really. There are some for GBA and DS from what I know, but that is probably not what you're looking for.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=4824">Grumskiz</a> — Thu Jul 12, 2012 1:56 am</p><hr />

Hi!  So far it's been pretty easy finding great flash carts for all of the Nintendo systems except the old Gameboy.  I know of this card:<br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://kitsch.bigcartel.com/product/usb-64m-smart-card">http://kitsch.bigcartel.com/product/usb-64m-smart-card</a><!-- m --><br /><br />but I'm also in the market for something I can pop into my Super Gameboy adapter for the SNES.  In which case this product gets iffy reviews and still has to be turned on and off quickly to cycle through pages of ROMs.<br /><br />Is it okay to hold out hope for one of the awesome folks behind such devices as the Everdrives and SD2SNES to construct an equally awesome Gameboy flashcart?<br /><br />Thanks a lot <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_exclaim.gif" alt=":!:" title="Exclamation" /><p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=5354">I_Am_Error</a> — Wed Jul 11, 2012 8:43 pm</p><hr />
