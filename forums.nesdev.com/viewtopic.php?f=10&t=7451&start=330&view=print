Two types are mandatory: "empty" and "solid", and you have 2 left to choose from "water", "lava" (or anything that hurts), "platform" (only solid at the top), "conveyor belt", and so on. If your game can get away with only 4 -types, that's OK, but many games need more.</div><br />Um, I think our game could use just 4... maybe.  Thanks for this great explanation tokumaru!

Each byte defines the 4 palettes used in a 32x32-pixel area, one palette for each 16x16-pixel area. The good thing about using 32x32-pixel blocks is that you don't have to do any sort of attribute byte manipulation, you can just copy attribute bytes straight to the attribute tables (as long as you don't scroll vertically).</div>  Will tell my sister; thanks tokumaru! <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /> This is interesting.

<br />Not exactly true, no matter what size of metatiles you use, you can always have walls that are 8 pixels wide (or even thinner). It all depends on how you're handling collisions, not the actual graphical contents of the metatile/tiles. In this sense it's best to think of metatiles simply as a method of compression.

<br />
<br />Ok, wow... thank you thefox!  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" />  
<br />edit: So does that mean it is possible to use 2x2 compression with more than 2 bits for the collision blocks and still have 8 pixel (or thinner) wide walls?  How could I do that?  I am betting I need more experience in order to understand that... ok.  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />

<br /> I'm not trying to achieve much... it is a bit like working out the logic...   I need another index register, i think, so I can keep track of three variables.

<br />Slopes might need more information though, which could come from the tile's index. I would probably put all the slopes at the beginning of the tileset, and whenever a slope is found the index of the tile would be used as an index into the table of height maps.

<br />Can't you just arrange the metatiles some other way? For example, instead of doing this (which you can't, because <strong>W</strong>ater and <strong>S</strong>olid can't be in the same metatile):
<br />
<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">+---+<br />|A A|<br />|A A|<br />+---+<br />|W W|<br />|S S|<br />+---+<br /><br />A = Air;<br />W = Water;<br />S = Solid;</div><br />You can do this (which has the exact same effect, it's just aligned differently):<br /><br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">+---+<br />|A A|<br />|W W|<br />+---+<br />|S S|<br />|S S|<br />+---+</div>
<br />I really can't think of many cases where you'd absolutely need 2 different kinds of collisions in the same metatile. I'm pretty sure that in 99% of the cases the level design can be slightly altered to match the limitations.
