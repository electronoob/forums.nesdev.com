I wanted to make this into a poll, but I included too many options, so I'll just update this regularly. (I'm on this website enough! <img src="./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" /> ) I think I covered all the non very random ones, but I could have missed one, so tell me and I'll add it. I could include something like the FM Toons Marty, but then I'd have to include a bunch of other stuff. My favorite video game consoles are in this order:<br /><br />SNES<br />N64<br />NES<br />Genesis<br /><br />(Score 1 for SNES!)<br /><br />The reason I chose top 4 is because these are very close together and my other favorite consoles are a ways away. (I often have trouble deciding whether or not I like the N64 or NES more.) Note: I have not played all the game consoles on this list.<br /><br />Current Winner: NES: 6<br />TI-99/4A: 1<br />Vectrex: 1<br />Channel F: 0<br />VideoBrain: 0<br />Odyssey2: 0<br />CreatiVision:0<br />SG-1000: 0<br />Atari 2600: 0<br />Intellivision: 0<br />ColecoVision: 0<br />Atari 5200: 0<br />NES: 6<br />Atari 7800: 0<br />Master System: 0<br />TurboGrafx-16: 0<br />Genesis: 1<br />Neo Geo: 0<br />Super NES: 4<br />Saturn: 0<br />PlayStation: 0<br />Virtual Boy?: 0<br />N64: 0<br />Dreamcast: 0<br />PS2: 1<br />Game Cube: 0<br />Xbox: 0<br />Xbox 360: 0<br />Wii: 0<br />PS3: 0<br />Wii U: 0<br />Xbox One (best name ever): 0<br />PS4: 0

I never found them enjoyable, because if I'm playing a game, I want to feel tense, like playing Contra on you're last life or something, not to read a bunch of text boxes. I know what you're thinking, why is the SNES even you're favorite console? Well, there are <strong>tons</strong> of good games for the SNES (I own 30+ SNES games that I play regularly, with not a single one being an RPG) with my favorite being the DKC games. I do feel that the SNES didn't get enough love with shooters though, even if the hardware is perfectly capable. (with 128 sprites, I'd say so! <img src="./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=":wink:" title="Wink" /> ) I think R-type 3 makes up for it though, even If it is really short. (Shooters aren't exactly known for their length.)

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Technically, I can't say the Gameboy Advance (because it's a portable handheld, not a console), so I'm torn between the SNES, the Playstation, and the Playstation 2. I'm big on JRPGs, and all three systems have some of the best. Do I choose Chrono Trigger or Valkyrie Chronicles or Tales of the Abyss? And to boot, all three also have Star Ocean games. Ultimately, I spent more time with my PS2, and it was more memorable for me.<br /><br />Aside from JRPGs, goodness, I spent hours upon hours playing Ace Combat 04 (the music was/still is incredible), Burnout, Killzone (the 1st game is rather silly, but fun all the same). Metal Gear Solid 3 was absolute brilliance when I played it, and I felt that way all over again when I did another run on PCSX2.

In other words, I surely say NES because I played at that time, same for the releases of Super NES, N64, Game Cube, Wii... <br /><br />1. NES - basically, my love for Mega Man games and masterpieces like Battletoads, Gradius II and many others.<br />2. Nintendo 64 - a different gameplay experience, played Star Fox 64 for the first time, later Mario 64, Donkey Kong 64. Surely masterpieces.<br />3. Super NES - one game, one feeling, Street Fighter II. Let me mention Super Metroid as *the* masterpiece of all times.<br />4. Game Cube - again, one game, one feeling, Super Mario Sunshine. Not much here... perhaps Metroid games and that's it. -_-;; Games like Star Fox were &quot;crap&quot;.<br />5. Wii - the Virtual Console and NES-style games like Mega Man 9 and 10.

I'm kind of surprised you didn't put Sega Genesis or Master System for one of them, as I thought they were popular in Brazil.
