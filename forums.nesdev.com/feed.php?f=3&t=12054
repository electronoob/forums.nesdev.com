Sorry Boolean, but I just can't seem to find a fix to the problem.<br /><br />I have released an updated version (v3).

Sorry to have to plug this here but it also serves a purpose for NESemdev. I have a new web site <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.jamesturner.de/">http://www.jamesturner.de/</a><!-- m --> which will eventually host WedNESday some time next year alongside other programs that I have written. At the moment there is only 1 program available for download.<br /><br />This programs deletes bad dumps of ROMs leaving only the good ones behind. I wrote this for myself but also thought that others would find it useful. The readme.txt describes how to use the program. This is the first thing that I have ever written and published so fingers crossed! You can find it under the Software section of the site but do check out other pages as well.<br /><br />If you do download it please report any bugs and let me know what you think by posting below. Please read the disclaimer before using!<br /><br />Thanks!<br /><br />James<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=191">WedNESday</a> — Sun Nov 23, 2014 12:16 pm</p><hr />
