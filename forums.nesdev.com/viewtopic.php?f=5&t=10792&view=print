Orrr....I have no idea....<br /><br />Could someone help me with finding out what is the best program to make SNES music like hgr128, WITHOUT using hex editor? I am horrible with hex editor. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" alt=":(" title="Sad" /> Trying to find the same or similar &quot;tracker/composer&quot; as of hgr128. FL Studio is expensive if your wondering...<br /><br />(Sorry if I explain much, but it's the only way I can explain right.)

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Well I understand that as a user, a command prompt is not very appealing, but trust me as a programmer it is. You can make programs which are much smaller, faster and simpler than if you wanted to deal with buttons, menus and all this stuff. I made it pretty clear in the doc how to use it (and there is no need for Java any longer) so it should be simple enough for anyone.<br /><br />Also you can use brrtools to batch convert a large set of .wav files into .brr for instance. You could even make a script that search all .spc files in your disk drive and rip all samples from them. You can't do that ever with SNESSor. However, if you want to plain rip samples from a SNES ROM (not a SPC file), SNESSor does it very well, and I didn't bother to implement it because well SNESSor already does it well.<br /><br />What I was talking about is just an idea right now but I'd really like to make it true. It would not be related to famitracker in any way, exept the fact it'd allow to compose music for video game consoles. My idea is to make something much more efficient that is usable in actual games. Also it'd be based on Music Macro language (MML) and not a tracker, so you'd just edit music with Notepad and compile it with the command line in some form of binary, which can then be included with a build of a SPC, or other music format.

Oh, and again after making another change? GUIs are about manually doing things over and over, making little errors or not doing it exactly the same each time. Inferior.

This saves the current document and runs a script which executes either the &quot;run&quot; target in the Makefile in the current directory, which you have build and emulate, or just executes the commands at the top of the current file until it hits exit (comment them out so they are skipped by the language the source file is in). This fosters a whole new degree of compulsive experimentation with changes because it's so cheap to try them and back out.

I remapped it to Ctrl+R because my laptop's built-in keyboard turns most of the F keys into &quot;multimedia keys&quot; unless I hold down the &quot;Fn&quot; key between Ctrl and Super.
