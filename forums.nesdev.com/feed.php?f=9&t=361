I have been planning to build something like this for quite awhile, i replaced my exp. connector from my deck with a sawed-off ISA connector to make more convinient to use.<br /><br />Has anyone RE'd the load/save function? i belive it should have somekind of start/stop signatures or similar to indentify what exactly NES is trying to do with it.<br /><br />I think this tapedrive simulator could be done by using UART, LPT or USB, without using any additional circuitry.<p>Statistics: Posted by Guest — Fri Jul 01, 2005 2:12 am</p><hr />

What are the voltages for a headphone level signal, and what are the voltages expected by the Famicom expansion port? Perhaps all we need is to run a comparator on the difference between the signal and a low-pass filter of the signal in order to get a 1-bit demodulation of the data on the cassette.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=9">tepples</a> — Mon Jun 20, 2005 12:32 pm</p><hr />

Very true, the Supercharger could use any decent cassette player.   However, between the 2600 and the cassette recorder there was the Supercharger hardware.  That hardware had four major components, the ROM, the RAM, the mapping circuitry and an Analog to Digital Converter.  The Cuttle Cart (1) operates similarly but in a far more advanced way.  <br /><br />Now, a NES already has the ROM, the RAM and the mapping circuitry on the cartridge, if any.  But what about recording onto and reading back from cassette tapes? The NES does have 4x4-bit and 1x7-bit DACs for its sound channels.  But a normal cassette recorder does not have an ADC, perhaps the Famicom's Cassette Recorder does.  Otherwise, how can it reliably receive the data, which it expects to be digitized?<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=58">Great Hierophant</a> — Mon Jun 20, 2005 12:18 pm</p><hr />
