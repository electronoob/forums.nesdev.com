I did this to A) learn how to work with variables, B) learn how to create sprites, and C) figure out how to work with button presses.<br /><br />My plan with this is to figure out stuff as I go (getting help only when I need it) so that eventually I will be able to create a game. I'm not ready to make a game yet, but I am getting there.<br /><br />(BTW I'm programming in C to begin with, then I plan to learn 6502 ASM and switch to that.)

I'm guessing it's a bug with FamiTone or something.<br /><br />YET ANOTHER EDIT: How many more edits am I going to make, anyway? <s>At least I&#39;m editing my post rather than posting 5 times in a row</s> ANYWAY, I decided to do that SEEEEGAAAAAAAAAAA thing with DPCM.

For example, a 6502 does roughly twice as much in each cycle as Z80, so 1.8 MHz NES vs. 3.6 MHz SMS is a wash. And I found a metric called <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/viewtopic.php?p=92238#p92238" class="postlink">gencycles</a> that captures roughly how many 68000 cycles correspond to a 65816 cycle in a given area of SNES memory. There are a few architectural wins in the 68000, but they're not nearly as dramatic as Sega and its fanboys made them out to be back in the day.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">we do not have prejudice for or against Sega.</div><br />Naxatsoft, on the other hand, hid a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrQn-O_zFRc" class="postlink">secret anti-Sega intro</a> in the near-bullet-hell shoot-em-up <em>Recca</em> for Famicom.

Sega fans are really hardcore and will vomit at any non-Sega system. Part of this might be due to recent Sonic games being released on Nintendo systems, and I've hear they suck (however I haven't played any Sonic game - recent or old - period so I can't tell).<br /><br />I don't doubt there is RPGs on Sega consoles but I have never owned nor played any of them so I just can't tell how good/bad they are.
