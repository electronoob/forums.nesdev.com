		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />There are many linked off the main site: nesdev.com . I suggest learning the 6502, getting a good graphics editor like YY-CHR, and reading a NES tutorial like GBA guys tutorials. VERY IMPORTANT: GBA guy's tutorials are crap once you've read them, and have understood them. He does many incorrect things, and he often says he doesn't know what he's talking about. But for some reason, they did give me a good boost into the world of NESdev. His website I believe has expired, and exists no more, but I saved his tutorials on my computer a long time ago, and uploaded them on my website:
<br />
<br /><!-- w --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.freewebs.com/the_bott/gbaguy.zip">www.freewebs.com/the_bott/gbaguy.zip</a><!-- w -->
<br />
<br />I will probably be bombarded by people saying to not suggest those tutorials to anyone but the trash can, but I just suggest you read through them, even though in the end they'll prove to be nothing but wasted PC memory. He shows how to include a graphics file in a ROM, he doesn't really explain it, but he shows you how to do it. Just read through those, but first read through some 6502 docs. There are many on the main site. Come back if you have any questions.

<br />
<br />On the other hand, if you want to get near and dear to your NES, you'll want to program in 6502 assembly.  If you don't know that, go ahead and start learning.  I have some time in programming (not officialy of course, just a little schooling), and I've been finding it hard to think in terms of the <strong>machine</strong> as opposed to 'If' statements and the like.  I find it more interesting to try and learn in this way.  I haven't been studying like I should though  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_redface.gif" alt=":oops:" title="Embarassed" />   
<br />
<br />Check out the <a href="http://nesdev.com" class="postlink">main page of this site</a> and start scanning through some of the documents there to get an idea, but I suggest learning 6502 assembly first.  There's a book by Rodnay Zaks that's pretty good for that.  It's called 'Programming the 6502' (go figure).  It's something else <img src="./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" />
<br />
<br />EDIT: Celius beat me to it <img src="./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" />

<br />On a side note, I was unable to deal with HLA. It is useless crap in my opininon. Not only it does merge standards from C and ASM, but also it disables you to use code pasted from anywhere else, it doesn't allow simple commands like "include" and all it's "libraries" are just crap such as routines that pushes a on the stack or something like that.
