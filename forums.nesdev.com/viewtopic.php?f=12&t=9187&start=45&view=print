This afternoon I changed the preprocessing algorithm, from only checking the earliest scanline with a stale colour to using a two-constant quality weighting system on <em>all</em> scanlines with stale colours.  (This boosted the execution time from 3-4 seconds to 30-40 seconds...)  The result is attached - the first version had 337 colours; this one has 417.  And it's still only using about 34% of the available HDMA bandwidth.  I guess it's just a stubborn picture; the success of the HDMA scheduling seems to depend to a significant degree on the parameters used in the image quantizer...<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">tepples wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">So it's more like the 3200-color mode of DreamGrafix for Apple IIGS.</div><br />I... guess so, yeah.  I'd never seen that before.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">Mode 3 gives you a 256-color BG1 and a 16-color BG2, and 256-color layers can be set to &quot;direct color&quot; (a constant BBGGGRRR palette). This &quot;direct color&quot; alone nearly equals anything that can be done with the Genesis. But then you can do color addition between a direct color layer and a 16-color layer with a BBGR palette. Or did we already rule that out pages ago?</div><br />No, it was mentioned (by you, as a matter of fact), and AFAICT it should work.  The problem is that it overloads the VRAM, so you have to letterbox it a bit.

Writes are byte-wide, not word-wide (unlike in the Mega Drive). This means that transferring a color takes up two writes. So here's the question: does the first byte get latched until the second is written, or do bytes get written immediately? Because if the latter, the method won't work (every other column would have an invalid color).<br /><br />EDIT: also that's not what HAM does (HAM basically just takes the previous pixel and replaces one of the RGB components to get the new pixel), but eh, you get the idea.

That looked very HAMmy to me.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />No, COLDATA is separate from CGRAM.  It's the subscreen background colour.  Writing an arbitrary colour to it takes six pixels (assuming standard DMA at 8 cycles per byte), and intermediate values would be displayed - assuming writing to it during display takes immediate effect.  Grayscale or monochrome could be done with two-pixel granularity...<br /><br />Isn't the CPU (and by extension DMA) halted for 40 cycles in the middle of every scanline?  That wouldn't look very nice...<br /><br />...<br /><br />I do kinda like the mosaic idea combined with colour math, if you really want full-screen direct colour and don't mind horizontally doubled pixels.  It seems like it should work, though the underlying palette would only be 12-bit...<br /><br />Unfortunately it <em>still</em> wouldn't be the functional equivalent of the MD version, since a single frame would exceed the available DMA bandwidth, whereas the MD version by definition does not.  And since a full screen of this would take up more than half the VRAM, paging would be impossible without tearing...
