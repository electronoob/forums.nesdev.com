It flushed the current game market to the toilet for short term profits (konami being one of the many suspects doing so).<br /><br />Scam seem quite an appropriate word. I wanted to like because I love portable terminals but I really cannot with the current trends.

The f2p apps are great but they only earn you a one-time income when the app is downloaded. As such, the app creators have to convince you to spend money on the app in order to unlock new levels, gain special powers and such incentives. It may seem like a rip-off but it's just the business of the gaming industry. Plus serious gamers tend to spend money on the games they love hence this venture works!

When I look through the pay-for games on Google Play, it doesn't look <em>any</em> different from the shovelware nightmare that is the free/free-to-play listings. So, certainly, part of the blame goes to the platform and developers. I mean, I tried, but I've given up on mobile as a competent platform for quality gaming.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />After some careful thought, freemium feels a lot like a way of trying to make something financially feasible that isn't actually financially feasible. I've stopped to decide whether or not I'd try making mobile games, and it feels like it's too much of a crapshoot.<br /><br />One thing that miffs me is how popular Flappy Bird got, just by pure chance, this one game is the one that got insanely popular. Meanwhile, there's dozens of other games that have more depth and more time put into them that just don't take off. You also have the price limit where the average price of a game has to be around $5 at most. You also have to consider <em>when</em> people actually play their phone games. It's usually during spontaneous bouts of downtime, like waiting for the bus, or trying to ignore people. The games need to be simple and need to be easily jumped into and jumped out of, and usually there's no real depth to them, so people only expect to shell a handful of dollars since it's the equivalent of buying a tetris keychain. A toy.<br /><br />So that's another point to address, if these games need to be easily jumped into and out of, and are only played during spontaneous bouts of downtime, imagine how frustrating it is when you're &quot;out of energy&quot; and have to wait x amount of time to be able to play again, <em>~or you can pay to play right now!~</em> This tactic feels so un-kosher, Hi, I'm a game you can play in your downtime, except not really because I decide when you get to play, unless you feel like shelling out. I've written microtransactions as a necessary evil for the mobile platform (and since I'm not a fan of it, I'm not entering the mobile platform), but pay-or-wait models are what feels scammish.<br /><br />Anyway, mobile games need to fit a specific mold because of the user base and when this user base actually plays the games. That usually ends up with a game that's so simple it might as well be a cheap toy, so the price has to stay super low, but you can't fund your company with just that, so that's where microtransactions come in, pay-or-wait comes in, pay-to-win comes in, it's all just a lame hack to get something that's not financially feasible to be financially feasible, and it's just not for me.<br /><br />How do you make mobile games without microtransactions and stay in business? Simple, move out of mobile and go to console or PC.
