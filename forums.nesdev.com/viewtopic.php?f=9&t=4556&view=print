		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I've got a Power Pak Lite I'm trying to use with a V1.0 
<br />parallel CopyNES with Flash Mod.  The problem is my laptop Has Windows XP.  I can get the CopyNES to dump and play carts with CopyNESw.exe but it doesn't have support for the Power Pak Lite.  Kevin's Qbasic Nesdump3.bas program has support for the Power Pak Lite but I can't get it to work in Windows XP.  I've tried changing the parallel port to all three settings in the BIOS (ECP, Normal and Bi-Directional) and I still can't get the CopyNES to respond to Nesdump3.bas.  I'm kind of at a loss as to what to do now. Any ideas?

<br />AFAIK, in XP programs don't have direct access to the parallel port. You could try making a DOS/WIN9X boot disk with QBasic and the program in it. Boot from it and you will be in native DOS mode, maybe it will work then.
<br />
<br />I used to grab boot disk images from <a href="http://www.bootdisk.com/" class="postlink">here</a> back when I had a floppy drive. Since many people nowadays don't, maybe they offer bootable DOS/WIN9X CDs now. Check it out. Even if they don't, I'm sure you'll be able to find one, because I'm sure I have seen it before. I also remember reading about programs that can convert bootable floppy images into CD images.

<br />
<br />Actually, that would be the best thing all around.  If someone were to do that I would be extremely grateful.
<br />
<br />I've tried a couple if dos boot cds but I couldn't get it to work.  I'll play around with it some more but I'm not holding my breath.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Well, I ended up booting into dos on an old 486 laptop I've got and running the copynes program off a floppy disk.  This is a bit annoying as it takes forever to copy stuff to and from floppy disks. Anyway, the one odd thing I've noticed is the Copynes program allows you to write wram to a cart, but in order to backup the wram, you have to use the dump cart option which dumps everything.  I'm really surprised there isn't an option to only dump the wram.
