		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I've always wondered why m185 games, which are also CNROM, are able to disable VROM, and even more so, the fact they all use different values to do it. So I broke down and bought a few of them to see if I could figure anything out.
<br />
<br />As I expected, the HVC-CNROM boards are the same as the NES-CNROM boards, except they don't have the CIC stuff of course. Any CNROM game could have made use of this "feature" if they wanted too. The LS161 uses not only D0 and D1, but also D4 and D5. Which, if used, connect to CHR A12 and CHR A10 respectively.
<br />
<br />Here's a pic of a NES-CNROM board. As you can see, the traces for the 2 lines are not connected.
<br />
<br /><img src="http://bootgod.dyndns.org:7777/downloads/NES-CNROM.jpg" alt="Image" />
<br />
<br />Anyways, mapper 185 games actually do use this, and the values they use  are different because they use different diode configurations as a "key" so to speak.
<br />
<br />Here are the carts I have:
<br />
<br />Mighty Bomb Jack
<br /><img src="http://bootgod.dyndns.org:7777/downloads/mbj.jpg" alt="Image" />
<br />
<br />B-Wings
<br /><img src="http://bootgod.dyndns.org:7777/downloads/bwings.jpg" alt="Image" />
<br />
<br />Sansuu 2 Nen
<br /><img src="http://bootgod.dyndns.org:7777/downloads/sansuu2.jpg" alt="Image" />
<br />
<br />Bird Week
<br /><img src="http://bootgod.dyndns.org:7777/downloads/birdweek.jpg" alt="Image" />
<br />
<br />Notice that Bird Week does not have diodes installed, so it technically can't do this technique, but it still checks to make sure it's not mirrored into bank 0, and thus locks if it is.
<br />
<br />Personally, I think m185 should be done away with, it's basically a hack anyways. There are 2 ways I can think of to do so.
<br />
<br />First way would require no changes in emulation, but IMO it's still a hack way to do it. Basically these games fail normally because they check a cetrain bank, usually 0, to make sure data isn't mirrored there. So to avoid this, the CHR ROM of the dump could simply be padded with dummy data and only have the real data in the bank it expects.
<br />
<br />The second, better way, would be to have emulators not mirror the CHR data for CNROM carts, but fill unused banks with either typical open bus noise: 01,02,03...FF repeated thoughout like you'd get on the real thing, or you could just fill them with FF. It really doesn't matter what is in the unused banks as long as it's not a mirror of the real data. This way however would require that the emulator know which bank it needs to load into. Since the NES 2.0 spec is still on the table, I think a couple of bits should be added for this purpose.
<br />
<br />Actually, it'd be nice if the NES 2.0 spec had some space allocated to context sensitive info like this rather than having the bits taken up no matter what.
<br />
<br />Back to the diode thing, emulators really don't need to know the config of these as long as they map the memory out like above. You do need to set D4 and D5 properly when dumping them though.

<br />
<br />One thing you should also note is that the solder pad in the upper-right corner is filled on Bird Week (pulling some signal to GND) but unconnected on the others - this is probably why it can disable the ROM even without the diodes.

An emulator would see mapper 3 as "no CHR disable" and mapper 185 as "CHR disable."  As I recall, NES 2.0 has a sub-mapper field that can be used to select which banks should be deemed invalid.

<br />
<br />185 is written to work specifically for a few games, if a new one were to come along, it probably wouldn't work. Emulators I've looked at generally just go by this table:
<br />

<br />  F0h  0Fh  Bird Week
<br />  00h  33h  B-Wings

<br />I'm still not understanding anything to the behaviour of this. Recent CNROM boards seems to have no slot for diodes, and the only other solder pad aside of mirroring forces A14 of the ROM to GND for games using 16kb PRG I assume. It's marked 'CL1' as MMC5 games, hehe.

<br />I really don't understand how this works from a technical standpoint either. Maybe kevtris could explain it better? I'll try to draw something about how the diodes are used though.

<br />16K ROMs aren't mapped, they will appear in BOTH $8000 and $C000 because they are only partially decoded (toggling A14 has no effect on a ROM without A14) so that couldn't be it.

<br />It looks like the actual intent is for handling 16K games stored in 32K ROMs (so they wouldn't have to make a CNROM-128 board as well as CNROM-256).
