I know that one can re-write char-ram during vblank, but that consumes lots of precious CPU cycles that are better used for updating name tables.

<br />
<br />I know, this is a major limitation of this proposed mapper. What I plan on doing is implementing what I have documented, then fitting it for a CPLD. Once I know how many macro cells and I/O pins the base design requires we can see how much more it would cost to add CHR-ROM or CHR-RAM banking.
<br />
<br />The ultimate plan is to develop an NESDEV2 that supports more features, and an NESDEV3 that supports much larger memory spaces (on the order of 4 MB ROMs and 1MB PRG-RAM). These two designs will be even more expensive to create both in terms of logic requirements and board space. For those reasons I want to limit the initial design to basically a (very) enhanced UNROM board.
<br />
<br />Thank you for your input! If I have learned anything throughout the past several weeks it is that what I create hardware-wise is very much a product of the community. I could not even begin to do any of this without the contributions you all have made long before I got here, and those you continue to make.

<br />CPLDs are cheap, but the ones designed to work in a 5.0 V environment are either much smaller (e.g. 36 to 72 macrocells) or far more expensive. FPGAs generally need a CPLD to load them at power-on. This takes time, and the CPU needs to have the reset vector yesterday. ASICs are dirt cheap in quantity, but the first unit is cost prohibitive for a hobbyist to make.

IIRC, MMC3 interrupts can be as close as 2 scanlines apart. So you can have up to 120 or so in the same frame. What happens in those interrupts is up to the programmer, but I don't why you couldn't have status bars at the top and at the bottom.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">I do with that you could support banking CHAR-RAM though.</div><br />I second this request. Even though you can do a lot with 8KB of CHR-RAM, you really need CHR bankswitching to achieve that "16-bit" look, with large characters and lots of background animations.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">I know that one can re-write char-ram during vblank, but that consumes lots of precious CPU cycles that are better used for updating name tables.</div>
<br />Even if you use all of VBlank for updating tiles, you can only update about 17 of them every frame with the fastest code possible. The "definitive homebrew mapper" should really allow more than 8KB of CHR memory.

<br />
<br />Yea, when I wrote the bit about never turning off PPU rendering I knew we had to find another way. That's why I posed the question in the MMC5 thread about detecting the end of the frame.
<br />
<br />Is the NMI vector read if NMI is disabled? I'd rather have something that does not restrict the user's program architecture, flawed though it may be <img src="./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" />
<br />
<br />As for resets I am not too worried about that. If we figure out a good way of detecting the idle PPU then the IRQ counter will hiccup on the first frame after you turn rendering back on, assuming you turn it back on mid-frame. If you wait until the end of the frame (like a good lil' coder) there will be no hiccup.
<br />
<br />You could fool the IRQ counter by <em>reading</em> name table data via $2006 / $2007. Once we get this nailed down I think that and not enabling rendering mid-frame will be the only restrictions on using the IRQ.
<br />
<br />More and more I am thinking that a CPU cycle counting IRQ would be a heck of a lot easier to use and less prone to total and complete breakage at the hands of the program. Unfortunately VRC7 does not implement the super-the-cool SRAM features everyone's so hot about.
<br />
<br />Wow, this really is a balancing act if I've ever seen one!

<br />
<br />I know, but this is definitely a challenge we'll have to face for this setup. That's why I've started on the test ROM so early <img src="./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /> The good news is Nintendulator is not used for playing ROMs (for fun anyway <img src="./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" />), and it has a modular mapper interface. I am looking into providing both a revised MMC5 mapper that would support CHR-RAM and an NESDEV1-specific mapper that would emulate the actual hardware mapper (for compliance testing of software).

<br />Well I don't know. I agree blocking CHR-RAM mapper 0 roms and caping mapper 3 roms at 32k is stupid (please don't confuse the board names and mapper numbers.... arghh I think everyone habe been doing this for years anyways).
<br />
<br />If you look carefully at MMC5's feature, you'll see that the chip was fundamentally designed to work with CHR-ROM. Half of it's features (sparate banking for sprites and BG, ex-graphics, split screen) has been made to work with CHR-ROM, so that games could easily display much more than 512 tiles. So a MMC5+8kb of CHR-RAM combination would make very little sense since this will kill most functionalities of the MMC5.
<br />
<br />I guess you guys assumed a larger CHR-RAM, then yeah I agree it would be cool, but you'd have problems writing to it on a real MMC5 cart modified to have CHR-RAM. All the CHR chip enable lines are driven by the MMC5, so if you'd just write the write pin to CHR WR, you might not get what you're expecting, because the MMC5 drives all the enable lines and all the higher adress lines.
<br />
<br />In short I'll be very hard to control how to write to the CHR-RAM. You'd definitely want to totally disable ExRam and split screen when doing that, but even then there is still 2 sets of swapped banks. If you make it so that both matches, then *maybe* it would be possible to normally write to the CHR-RAM chip.
<br />
<br />That being said, I agree CHR-ROM alone is not very exciting and quite limited. On another hand the MMC5 would make the best of it, so yeah...
<br />
<br />I guess the only mapper who can handle more than 8k of CHR-RAM is the Namco one (no I'm not counting videmation's mapper because it can't do ANYTHING else), so maybe you guys would rather duplicate this one instead ? The main problem is that it's even harder to do testing on real Namco chips are they are only released in japan and usually are epoxy blobs.
