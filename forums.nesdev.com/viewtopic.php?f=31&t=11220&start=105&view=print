Inkscape glitches on the logo and doesn't render the line widths correctly. If you need a bitmap render of this, open the file in <a href="http://www.gimp.org/" class="postlink">GIMP</a> and type in your desired DPI (like 600) in the Resolution field. The fonts are baked into the file expect for the notice at the bottom which uses the font &quot;Droid Sans&quot;.<br /><br />If any adjustments are needed, I'll just update the file at that URL.

Holding turbo and killing player 2, and then starting a player 1 game notices player 2 is nonexistent and assumes you won fight mode again. I really should start putting version numbers on things.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />So last night until morning I got RC1 tested a bit by other kids. Most kids and teenagers there wanted to do other things but there was at least one kid who played the entire time. Favorite games were DABG, robotfindskitten, and Solar Wars. The other games where also briefly played. RHDE was tried for just one round but the game was too confusing to pick up right away. To my confusion another kid said he had played super pakpak (and later lawn mower) &quot;on the gameboy&quot; before <img src="./images/smilies/icon_confused.gif" alt=":?" title="Confused" />. After a few hours I had to leave the room for the rest of the party so I just let them play my selection of homebrew games contained on my powerpak (like thwaite and &quot;A pirated copy of LJ65&quot;). As the party came to a close, the kids playing Solar Wars experienced the stack overflow bug. No surprise to me that even the mapper got stuck. So yeah, it was an awesome time.<br /><br />@NovaSquirrel: That is correct.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">NESHomebrew wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">Was there any interest in making this a boxed release?</div>I'm sure collectors like boxes. I don't, but that's because I care more about an included manual than I do a box that would most likely have the same art as the game label.

I don't know if it needs to be printed, but at least a very obvious download on the &quot;For Sale&quot; page.  I'd say that most of them are straight forward, but unless you know the ins and outs of it you might totally miss things (like mouse/zapper support on the menu).

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />The thing I like about video game manuals is not so much the &quot;press A to do things&quot; line of explanation (for which the multicart menu takes care of), but rather things like the game setting, pictures for each of the available actions. original concept art, things like that. Last year is has been said that we should <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/viewtopic.php?p=114767#p114767" class="postlink">collaborate on this on a wiki</a> and I agree. Perhaps I should start with a wiki page with what would be nice to have in a video game manual. Maybe by the time the master release comes around we'll have enough art assets and text excerpts to compile into a sizable manual.<br />--------<br /><br />That said I like the single-sheet manual idea, and I'm writing it now. It's a folded sheet with the front titled &quot;action53 Quick Start Guide&quot; (not double because this would hopefully be generic), and in it will be several brief sections explaining things like:<br /><ul><li>Operation of the multi region chip (I assume it works like the ciclone)</li><li>Basic controls of the menu including how the reset buttons returns to the menu</li><li>Explanation of the controller symbols in the menu (a plus sign could either mean all directions or a combination of a and b)</li><li>SNES mouse wiring diagram.</li><li>if there's room, &quot;Health and Safety&quot;</li><li>Something else that should be explained?</li></ul>and on the back would be 3 URLs to nesdev, nintendoage, and infiniteneslives.<br />--------<br /><br />I asked INL about what the box would be like and with his permission I'm posting what he said in that regard.<br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">As for traditional or bitbox options both are possible.  In general small volumes of bit boxes are more cost effective due to the smaller initial investment because we can do batches of 1-100.  Traditional boxes are lower cost each, but require a large volume of 250+ with a large initial investment.  I do think we will easily sell well over 100 copies in a few months time, so traditional boxes are a viable option if we'd like to go that route.</div>
