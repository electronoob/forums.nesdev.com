		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Well, i have a pirate cart with an "unknown" mapper and i'd like to dump it with my copynes but i don't know how to begin because my understandig of how a nes works is very, very basic, so any help would be very apreciated.
<br />The cart is this one:
<br /><img src="http://i25.photobucket.com/albums/c91/piteta/nes/policemanpcb.jpg" alt="Image" />
<br />
<br />it's a game by microgenius/txc called policeman, and as you can see it's using two ls chips  (138 and 175),  a "custom chip" and two 27c512 eproms. If this pcb didn't have that custom chip, it would be very similar to that ¿ave? mapper made of those two ls chips... but it has it so i don't know how to begin... and what troubles me most is that i'wont be able to know wheter is a good dump or not until that mapper is emulated <img src="./images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" alt=":(" title="Sad" />
<br />
<br />¿can anybody help me?

The 74138 will be for decoding it. The 74175 is 4 flip flops, you must look at the D inputs on the chip to see which 6502 data bits they are connected to and which address bits the Q outputs are connected to to figure out the configuration. It must have one bit for 32k bankswitching on PRG and 3 bits for 8k CHR bankswitching. Also there is no mirroring control because there is no multiplexer or even free register bits. Bankswitching is either at $6000 (SRAM space) or $8000 with bus conflicts. You will probably have to trace out the cart to get it right.

This could be done with a '139 instead, but I guess they needed all 3 of '138 adress (A14-A13 with /PRGSEL for decoding, and M2 for enabling ?).

<br />So, for example, when "lda #$04" is executed, the flip flops will be loaded with $a9, then $04, and I don't think they wanted to do that.
<br />So /PRG A15 MUST be ORed with R/W in order to activate the flip-flops so that only writes affects them.

<br />That chip is not a SRAM.  If it was a SRAM, it'd have a proper number on it such as 6116.  No, it's for sure a custom mapper chip.  I have dumped TXC carts before, and their mappers look just like that.  Unfortunately, it most likely is a different kind of mapper than the one I dumped which was on Creatom (a world inside your mind).   Even then, I dumped it by desoldering the ROMs and dumping, then resoldering.  The mapper did some really nasty things as a form of copy protection.

<br />I realized my horrific mistake and deleted it ;) The transistor I thought was configured as a NOT gate; with one more inverter I made my previous description work... after thinking about it more, it could also be part of a lockout circuit which I hadn't even considered before.
<br />
<br />I suppose Kevtris is right, though I must say I have seen Chinese RAM with obscure part numbers.

<br />
<br />was Creatom using the same pcb without the custom mapper (U3)? if it had, it would explain why when i tried to dump a copy of f15 city warrior i got a .nes file with bad chr size and corrupted graphics.
<br />
<br />So do you think that even disoledering the roms and read them with an eprom burner will be of no use because of the mapper copy protection ?

<br />
<br />No, it had a mapper that was very similar to that 24 pin job there.  If I come across the cart again I will check which mapper it has, but I think it was a different one.    Other than that, you will need to go over the cart using Bankwatch or Microbug using your CopyNES.  Usually what I do is dump the game as NROM and then disassemble the PRG data.  
<br />
<br />From there, I try to identify bankswitching registers and/or routines.  Usually they stand out because they will write to ROM area (8000-FFFF) and alot of times the bankswitches occur in the very end of the CPU space, say FE00-FFFF.  not always, but alot of times.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />i've just recieved a creatom and it uses the same chip... so any info about it will be great. 
<br />Btw, i'll dump the first 32k and i'll look for any write to that rom area. I guess that when i find writes to that area i will have to write there different values and see what happens.... but ¿wich things should i expect to happen?
<br />
<br />
<br />p.d i've scaned some pcbs, and one of them is creatom's pcb ...
<br />edit: i know the pic is big... but yesterday was a lot bigger ^^¿
<br /><img src="http://i25.photobucket.com/albums/c91/piteta/nes/PCBS_B.jpg" alt="Image" />
<br />well, in that pic there's a creatom pcb together with other carts i'd like to dump, so expect more questions about them in this thread.
