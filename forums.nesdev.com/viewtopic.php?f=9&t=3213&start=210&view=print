<br />Nintendo has released one component of NWC (Super Mario Bros.) on Virtual Console and another component of NWC (Tetris) on Nintendo DS. Besides, even in the case where actual damages are zero, statutory damages can be up to $150,000.

<br />
<br />I'm not sure he will get sued.  I've been selling reproduction for over 3 years now, and except for Yahoo shutting down my original web site, nothing really happened.
<br />
<br />Then again, I'm in Canada.. so the laws are different here for the states.  (We're allowed to copy/rip DVD's, rip CD's to MP3's, and use bit-torrent!)
<br />
<br />In any case, one should always check the laws of where they operate before starting any venture.

<br />Here in Brazil they are starting to bitch about those things, but we do it anyway. But they are mostly going after the people who sell pirate stuff (games and movies, mainly) on the streets.
<br />
<br />Then again, doing those things you mentioned is allowed in the US too AFAIK, as long as you rip your own CD's and DVD's, and do not use bittorrent to download coprighted material you do not own.
<br />
<br />I don't think bunnyboy has any reason to worry... Nothing that's NES-related has been profitable for Nintendo for a while. Plus, if someone really wants to save by not buying a game released for the virtual console, they will most likely download the ROM, not buy a repro. Tepples is going to say something anyway, but I don't care. =)

I don't understand what's the point of playing with a time limit, it should be incredibly frustrating to have the gameplay halting (exept for Tetris that I would never stand playing it more than 1 minute, let alone 6 minutes).

<br />it's all about the competative aspect of the game.

If what you said were true, the cart would have a blank flash ROM (or something of the sort) which you'd have to program yourself before using.  If he were selling only the hardware, there would be no legal issues whatsoever (frankly, I'm surprised that isn't what he's doing).

<br />If you look at the other items in the NES Hardware section of RetroZone, you'll see some references to an MMC1-based ReproPak with WRAM support, such as:
<br />
<br />"62256 - 32KB 28 pin DIP SRAM for ReproPak CHRRAM, and ReproPak MMC1 CHRRAM and WRAM"
<br />
<br />That said, it would've been nice to see WRAM support on the ReproPak already on the site.  Just because NROM, U*ROM, CNROM, and A*ROM boards didn't have WRAM doesn't mean it can't be supported on new boards that mimic these mappers.
