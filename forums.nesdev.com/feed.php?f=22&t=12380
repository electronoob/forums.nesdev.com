We didn't feel it was too much of a leap to block off the map with a single, tall tree there (although you can go inside of it). Besides that, you can pass through all trees but not branches.<br /><br />Yes, the controls themselves are in an in-game manual that you can read before playing. Only on the demo does it state how to use them in the rooms.<br /><br />About the same colored items, they are colored the same to represent that they are the spells that you get. Later on in the game though, they can be used in conjunction and are tied together with a graphic that looks similar to a tournament bracket. That was an item that we didn't want to include in the demo because we wanted people to see how each magic worked, but not give free reign over all of them.<br /><br />About X and Y, yes, I would've liked to have come up with something better, but the word &quot;levitation&quot; or a similar offshoot needed to be in there, and we were restricted in the amount of tiles that could say something on each screen or for each item picked up. I think people will understand well enough at least. <br /><br />@rainwarrior: Awesome, thank you so much! We both hope you dig it!<br /><br />@Erockbrox: There is a potion, which is in the demo, that you can pick up that doubles the speed of the wizard's levitation. It didn't seem right to have the levitation the same speed as what he walks, so it felt right to have it be a smaller amount, and to start off, it is even slower. The item can be the fourth one you pick up out of around 16 or 17 total items (can't recall off the top of my head how many there are).<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=174">Roth</a> — Mon Feb 16, 2015 9:41 pm</p><hr />

What type of contract exists between the creator of a new game and retrousb?<br /><br />I also played the demo and thought it was rather cool. If only the Wizards speed where increased a little, I think it would make it a little better. Like levitating and such.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=6785">Erockbrox</a> — Mon Feb 16, 2015 12:43 am</p><hr />

Hey all!<br /><br />You play as a wizard who had his land taken over and his spells and magical items stolen from him. You play through the game to collect your items and defeat the enemy that did this. It's an adventure game with a very _slight_ puzzle element. Acquiring different magical items will open up new areas for you to explore and continue on your quest.<br /><br />Here are a couple of links for you to check it out if you haven't seen or heard of this project:<br /><br />Short demo to experience the controls and most items:<br /><a href="http://slydogstudios.org/download/The%20Mad%20Wizard%20(Demo).nes" class="postlink">http://slydogstudios.org/download/The%20Mad%20Wizard%20(Demo).nes</a><br /><br />Video showing a bit of gameplay and a bit of what it's about&#058;<br /><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UsfhIAHE5k0" class="postlink">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UsfhIAHE5k0</a><br /><br />A shrunken-down version of the complete map:<br /><a href="https://twitter.com/slydogstudios/status/565230188305207297" class="postlink">https://twitter.com/slydogstudios/status/565230188305207297</a><br /><br />The game has been finished and is now available on retroUSB.com if anyone is interested:<br /><a href="http://www.retrousb.com/product_info.php?cPath=30&amp;products_id=137" class="postlink">http://www.retrousb.com/product_info.php?cPath=30&amp;products_id=137</a><p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=174">Roth</a> — Sat Feb 14, 2015 10:02 am</p><hr />
