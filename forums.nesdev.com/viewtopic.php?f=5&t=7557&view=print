<br />I'm not sure how long you've been part of the "community", but this sort of situation has recurred many times over (I'm talking a good 15-20), whether it be here on the boards or on IRC or otherwise.  It's nothing new, and its continual recurrence is one of the reasons why key people have removed themselves from involvement.  And yes, it's very specific to the nesdev community -- for a decade I've been trying to figure out why and still have no concrete explanation.  The best I have: the NES/FC seems to be an "<a href="http://www.penny-arcade.com/comic/2004/3/19/" class="postlink">Internet fuckwad</a> magnet".  And for the record, I don't read/like Penny Arcade.
<br />
<br />As for blargg: he's doing fine (read: he's alive and well).  I got a very honest and sincere explanation for his departure, but I do not feel comfortable violating his right to privacy by posting the contents of his Email here; that'd be disrespectful towards him, and I have no such disrespect.
<br />
<br />The simple version: he won't be returning here unless there are changes.
<br />
<br />There is a post in the moderators forum discussing the crux of the problem, but so far none of the other mods have commented.

<br />Would be nice if we at least got a rundown of what EXACTLY he thought was wrong. Can't expect people to change if they're not told they're "doing it wrong"

<br />
<br />I must have missed it too. I do remember one debate about the issue but I didn't keep up with it. I do remember a time where we seemed to get alot of requests about putting eproms of various games in carts and it got old quick.

<br />
<br />Are you sure it's <em>just</em> NES/FC? I've seen pointless bickering in a few other fields of programming, not just nesdev. In my opinion, programmers in general are just as prone to the same immaturity as nesdev is.

<br />
<br />The GD.net forums tend to be awash in rampant idiocy regarding fellows wanting to make an MMO from scratch in their bedroom. What posts aren't about the MMO project of the week tend to be equally misguided.
<br />
<br />Here, people tend to voice opinions that may not necessarily need voicing in public, but it tends to be relatively civil. Most of the time. There is a contingent that seems morally opposed to anything money related, period. Don't know whether they're worse than the "halp me lern everyting in a week" sort that show up every other month or so or not, but neither crew helps a ton.
<br />
<br />I do miss blargg's fantastic attention to technical details, but if he's decided to not post here or chill in #nesdev, that's his decision.

<br />
<br />Mmh is he really that angry about me strongly opposing people who come here just to ask how to make bootlegs of games ? Well I was just pissed of by them back then but with this thread I understood I'd just have to get used to it and that I just had to completely ignore those thread instead of getting mad at someone regular here that answer to them even if they don't deserve it.
<br />
<br />Is that the change blargg is looking for ? I don't understand and feel kind of bad but anyways he can do whatever he want.
<br />His last discovery, the "maximal degree of synchronization with PPU", was very promising. It could allow things such as (almost ?) stable PPU writes which could lead to amazing effects. The method for such a synchronization was very complex and I didn't fully understood it. Hopefully there will be some use for it once.
<br />
<br />About this communality's so called problems, I 100% disagree about what have been said. People just made problems up when there is now because they fear a lack of any problem.
<br />So if you guys would better have to make up a programming problem or something in the like it would be much more helpful.
<br />(or is it I who am the problem ? Oh god I sure hope this isn't the case)
