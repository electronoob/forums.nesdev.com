<div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"><br />Within the realm of music, having an idea for an overall song is hard to forget if it's a good idea. "I should write a song about xxxxx idea and it will be in X key, etc" is not too hard to remember, as well as the general feel of the song.<br /></div><br />To be honnest when I compose I usually "copy" that from an existing song and I decide "I'll make a song similar to this one". Then I try to come up with something else of course but re-using elements of the existing song. Often it ends up quite different from the original so someone who don't know would have no idea which song was your "inspiration". Not that I'm NEVER able to make a song all of my own, but I'm just not that skilled.<br /><br />Rush Jet you are probably a more experienced composer than I so things are different.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"><br />However, specific melody lines are tough to remember, even if they're amazing. It's similar to lines of programming.. if you think to yourself, while doing something else, that "oh, I could insert these instructions and my code would be more efficient," if you don't write it down, you might forget it if you're actively doing something else. I have this issue while driving to school-- if my phone is dead and I can't record things, I'll probably forget the melody line I thought up after awhile, probably due to the monotony of driving 9 hours straight<br /></div><br />Well it's hard to say, but usually I'll try anything on a piano until I can find something that is good enough to be remembered, and then I write it down in MIDI on my computer (and arrange it, add rythm / additional voices, effects, etc...) and eventually convert it to .db (if using my engine) or MML (if I use MCK).<br /><br />The bad stuff is that I feel like my songs are too monotonous, I hardly ever use sharps or flats, and I always use 4/4 beat. I'll try to compose at least a walz-beat type song for my game tough, becuse I really like walz-type songs.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"><br />I have this issue while driving to school-- if my phone is dead and I can't record things, I'll probably forget the melody line I thought up after awhile, probably due to the monotony of driving 9 hours straight<br /></div>Isn't there a law saying you should take a break every 2 hours when driving ?

Since you're usually more inspired when starting a project, it's probably a good idea to start with level 1 (and make it the amazing one), but for the other levels it really don't matter the order.<br /><br />Personally I'm having big trouble designing bosses since 3 years (started my project 5 years ago) so basically I do a boss-less game - and maybe it'll stay like that forever who knowns ? I only have a very basic idea about who are the bosses, but coding them is just something that make me more or less pause the project.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=38">Bregalad</a> — Thu Aug 19, 2010 8:53 am</p><hr />

OK a few trought...<br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"><br />While tight with concentration on what is being written, the writer has a thought, an insight, a partially articulate concept. The natural response is to think, "I can't stop what I am writing. I'll remember the idea," and continue writing. The writer is wrong. He will not remember it. The thought, the insight, the concept will disappear. It may return, but you will not need it then, or recall when it might have been appropriate.<br /></div><br />While it's true you can't remember everything, I'll generally see what happens naturally. This happens to game design, music composition or wathever : If you can't remember it, the idea wasn't that good. The day you have VERY good idea, you remember them. That way - by not writing it down or write it down only very roughly - you will naturally forget a bad idea or remember a good idea. While it's true you shouldn't be afraid of applying an idea you'd have fear is bad, you also shouldn't be afraid to throw away ideas that you didn't like.<br /><br />Another rule of thumb is that if you are absolutely looking for an idea, but throw away the first one because you think it's not good enough and are looking for something else instead, all the other ideas you'll get will be worse than the first (that is - if you actually remember the first). So you'd save time by implementing the first idea you remember and not asking any more questions.<br /><br />Other points I've figured in the development of my main NES project :<br />- For some reason at first you think the game has to be programmed in the same order that people will play it : i.e. Title Screen, Stage 1, etc...<br />There is technically absolutely no reason to do it that way.<br />- The most important thing is to have a cool Stage 1, with cool graphics and cool music. That's what everyone that will try your game will see, so give your best here. Only avid players will see the later stages.<br />- Music and graphics don't make a good game. However, they are still very important to games in my eyes. You'll forgive a game that has mediocre gameplay if it has a very good soundtrack and is very good or cool looking. Even a basically good game can be annoying if there is bad music, or graphic issues.<br /><br />Something that was interesting in this articles is that basically, you should make game for others. I admit for the major part I wanted to make game to have fun and to express myself. I did not think much about the people that are going to play it. The problem is that for my first game, no miracle but nobody any played any of your games, so no fanbase or wathever. I hope that after completing a first game you cna have people that count on you which is a big motivation, and even people that join you which could be a big time saver.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=38">Bregalad</a> — Wed Aug 18, 2010 12:10 pm</p><hr />

The problem I usually get is that I see the whole "checklist" of things I need to develop at once, and I don't write it down.<br /><br />As such, I end up with "Well, I want to add this, but to add this, I'll need to put this in, which will require me to put this in... oh, that'll break that."<br /><br />Basically, I have very disorganized thoughts, and it comes off as the project being really huge and unruly. At that point, it just feels like I have so much to implement that I lose interest.<br /><br />It's getting slightly better now, because with every project I start (and don't finish), I get a little bit more code to recycle, and all of that stuff put together will eventually create some rock-solid system code.<br /><br />But until then, I'll just start and abandon projects. <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" /><p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=21">Drag</a> — Wed Aug 18, 2010 8:52 am</p><hr />
