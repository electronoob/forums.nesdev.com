A lot of tiles are already wasted because of scaling, and having the sprites face different directions would make it impossible to have more than 1 in the tileset, if that.

The thing is that 2 colors are fixed in all palettes: the color for the ceiling and the floor, and the color used for shading (usually black). The other two are modified to accommodate the different walls found during rendering.<br /><br />I use 3 palettes for the 3D view, the 4th one is used for the interface around it. That means I have 3 pairs of colors to use per frame. Although that would be 6 colors, I have to worry about different colors that meet inside the same attribute block, so the only way to make sure the view can be correctly rendered is limiting it to 3 wall colors, so that pairs AB, BC and AC can handle every possible encounter of colors.<br /><br />And this is the reason why every pattern in the pattern table comes in two colors (red and blue in the image I posted), 'cause you may need to draw it using the first slot of the pair of colors or the second.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"><br />But then, what are they ?

Getting all tiles redrawn would be awesome, but then you'd get a framerate as horrible as Final Fantasy 2's 3D world map (press B+Select after having gotten the ring).<br />You could use longer VBlank and stack-indexed $2007 writes à la Battletoads to get tricky and win refresh time (however I'd leave less time for the frame calculation itself).<br />Other than this, I have trouble seeing how you could render any ray-caster only with a CHRROM pattern table.<br /><br />Oh, and I'd get for untextured walls and a higher framrate any time. It'd be a lot better if you ask me. (as long as they have a solid color, because if by "untextured" you mean wireframe, then ignore my previous senstence, because noting look as worse as wireframe does).<br /><br />You could also have CHRRAM, but have a fixed tileset in the BG pattern table, and use sprites that are automatically streatched in the SPR pattern table. I think that could look good (but that would be almost impossible to do I guess). Else goes the Rad Racer way, with pre-streched sprites in the pattern table.<br /><br />And something like this could definitely put the TQROM board to good use, (unlike, hem hem, Pinbot...)<br /><br />EDIT :<br />[Tepples mode on]<br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"><br />No console raycaster is very fluid, but they're all playable.<br /></div><br />My [ Instert Playstation 2 game here ] copy seems to be very fluid.<br />[Tepples mode off]<br /><br />I'm surprised he missed this one.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=38">Bregalad</a> — Wed Apr 25, 2007 11:59 am</p><hr />

<div class="quotetitle">tepples wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"><br /><em>Wolf3D</em> and <em>Super Noah's Ark</em> are pixel doubled, but the engine is still effective.<br /></div><br />Yeah. My conception of the NES raycaster uses "pixels" that are 8x2 actual pixels. Not a very good resolution, but rendering much more than 28 columns would be too slow (each column represents a ray that is traced through the map, and that means a couple of multiplications, tons of additions and subtractions - depending on the distance from the wall slice). More than that would also make it impossible to use a fixed tileset, which would make it even slower.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"><br /><em>Doom</em> uses a coprocessor at 21 MHz.<br /></div><br />And still slow....<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"><br />At least it's what <em>Faceball 2000</em> for Game Boy and Super NES appears to use.<br /></div><br />Walls are not textured, which makes it so much easier. If the walls are not textured, you only need to render the edges of the walls with the different angles the walls can be seen at. But I think all console raycasters generate tiles on the fly... not sure.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"><br />You can display the status bar with sprites.<br /></div><br />Yeah, if they are not used to place enemies and objects in the level. Other consoles (Genesis &amp; SNES) seem to use the background for that, but they have many more colors in their backgrounds. And making the objects with the background on the NES would also make it impossible to use that fixed tileset.<br /><br />The pre-calculated tiles I use to make the background use almost all the tileset, there are only 14 free tiles, I think. And that is after I decided not to use a random effect on the floor, which would have used all 256. If the screen could be split after the 3D window, the lower part of the screen could use the other half of the pattern table for the status bar. But sharing that with the actual sprites would be hard, as they have different zoom levels that really increase the tile count.<br /><br />CHR switching would be the way to go to have a detailed status bar/interface without giving up on sprites or any feature of the 3D view (such as the number of wall colors).<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=95">tokumaru</a> — Wed Apr 25, 2007 11:55 am</p><hr />

Play with some console raycasters, such as both "Zero Tolerance" games for the Mega Drive, or "Battle Frenzy"/"Bloodshot", also for the Mega Drive. They play a bit slow (don't know the exact frame rate), but they are playable. "Duke Nukem", also for the Mega Drive plays a bit faster. Try "Wolfenstein" and "Doom" for the SNES. Or "Jurasic Park", that becomes a 3D fighting game once you get inside the building.<br /><br />No console raycaster is very fluid, but they're all playable. The NES would be no exception. I believe it could run at a decent frame rate, not the best 3D experience in the world, of course, but a nice thing to see the NES doing.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"><br />And, what will look the worst between something with utterly skipped frames, and something with utterly skipped frame where you can see the refresh scrolling lines ? That won't make a very high difference.<br /></div><br />The second option is worse, IMO.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"><br />Unless you can render a 3D image with a fixeed tileset (or a large set of different fixed tilesets) I don't see much interest in it.<br /></div><br />My raycaster uses a fixed tileset, so that only the name and attribute tables have to be updated, while the pattern table, which is very expensive to update, is left untouched. This results in walls that are not very detailed, but are good enough so that one can recognize the shape of the maze.<br /><br />Rendering pixels to the pattern tables would be an interesting way to go for a raycaster on the NES, each frame could use a different side of the table, so that we can't see it being drawn. This would allow for a more detailed image and more colors could be achieved through dithering, but the 3D view would have to be smaller, specially considering that you have to display other things, such as the status bar. A mapper that allows switching between CHR-ROM and CHR-RAM would be great for this. Any cart with more than 8KB of CHR-RAM would be good, actually. I think the speed would be much worse if rendering pixels, though.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=95">tokumaru</a> — Wed Apr 25, 2007 10:14 am</p><hr />
