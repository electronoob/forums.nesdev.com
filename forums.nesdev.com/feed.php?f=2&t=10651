The US NES adapter (120VAC-&gt;1.3A@9VAC) should be just fine. I remember people mentioning they've done whole-brain swaps of PAL and NTSC NESes (swapping crystal, PPU, CPU, and CIC) and had it work fine, so the adapter should be completely compatible too.<br /><br />In any case, if it asks for 9VAC at 850mA, then any power supply rated for 9VAC at roughly that amount of current will be fine.<br /><br />(Regarding the vizio TV thing: I was kinda surprised when I discovered that my Acer LCD computer monitors support 240p/60 and 288p/50. In fact, the latter is the only 50Hz mode it can parse.)<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3512">lidnariq</a> — Wed Nov 06, 2013 2:19 am</p><hr />

lidnariq I have an official US Nintendo AC Adapter, the 9v but I don't want to chance blowing this up after I spent $130. I didn't check if that will fit, it looked like it did. I read that you can do that but it was not from a reliable site like this.<br /><br />I guess the safest option is to buy a UK NES Adapter on ebay (official) and then pick up that 100w converter? Unless my US Adapter will work but I am not trying it unless someone knows for sure.<br /><br />I wound up buying a Vizio TV for my room, and it supports 576i/p 25fps. I didn't buy it for that reason but noticed my PAL DVDs were playing correctly which was hard since I had it upscaled to 1080p but it is fully PAL compatible and good price. I know it's strange as my big TV refuses to support PAL: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B009IBXEE6/ref=wms_ohs_product?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1">http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B009IB ...

As far as I know, both the NTSC and PAL NESes use the same 9VAC input. It seems to me that finding a new 120V-to-9V adapter is probably easier (and likely cheaper?) than buying a 120V-to-240V adapter.<br /><br />I'm a little wary of the one you were given being only rated for 400mA, though; ISTR that's very close to what the NES consumes at minimum. If you do buy a new one, I think I've heard the general consensus be &quot;at least 7V, at most 13V, and at least 3/4 A&quot;, and, due to how the NES works, you're most likely safe with either AC or DC.<br /><br />(Koitsu: ungrounded AC adapters don't have a polarity.)<br /><br />Tangentially, what are you using to display the PAL image it'll produce?<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3512">lidnariq</a> — Tue Nov 05, 2013 11:04 pm</p><hr />

US is 120 volts, 60Hz.  UK is 240 volts, 50Hz; you're going to need a lot more than just an AC adapter, and I have no idea if the polarity on the AC adapters (towards the console) are reversed like they are between the US NES and the Famicom.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3">koitsu</a> — Tue Nov 05, 2013 11:00 pm</p><hr />
