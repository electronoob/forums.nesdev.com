Note pyNES wasn't writer by me, so some information may be wrong. Please take caution.

From my understanding, there are few functions you can define to make your game.

Interruption functions:

reset()
It is called upon game boot. Good place for initialization. Note that sprite definition/loading CHR/NSF/palettes/etc. files MUST be done at the very beginning of game file, otherwise it won't work. Equivalent of reset interruprion.

nmi()
Runs every vblank. Equivalent of NMI interruption.

Joypad functions:

Note: Capital X in function is to be substitued for either 1 or 2, defined by which joypad you want to query.

Names are self-explanatory, so I'll avoid being Cpt. Obvious and describing them.

joypadX_up()
joypadX_down()
joupadX_right()
joypadX_left()
joypadX_a()
joypadX_b()
joypadX_start()
joypadX_select()


Functions & procedures
===================

Functions that are preceded by (H) prefix, like (H) import_chr() are to be used only in game's header (i.e. before defining any interruption/joypad functions). 
If (H?) is uesed instead it means I'm not sure if it can be used only in header. 
If description contains (?) at the end, I'm not really sure if I'm correct (I amy be wrong about functions without (?) but here probability of failure is higher). 
If description consist of ??? (and eventual mention of usage of it in some example), I totally have no idea what it is for.

(H?) rs()
???. Used in slides.py example.

wait_vblank()
Waits for vblank. It is needed to sync game properly.

clearmem()
Clears NES' memory.

get_sprite(spritereference)
Get reference to specific sprite. See mario.py example for usage.

(H) import_chr()
Import CHR graphics file into ROM. CHR files can be made for example with great tool called YY-CHR. See mario.py for an example.

(H) define_sprite(x,y,TILELIST,paletteID)

Defines sprite. X,Y is default position on screen (after loading it with load_sprite()), tilelist is list of CHR 8x8 tile indices that makes up sprite.

cls()
Clear screen (?)

show(string, y=None,x=None,nametable=0)
Puts text on nametable (?). Used in slides.py example.

load_palette(palette)
Loads palette. 'palette' is just a flat array of 32 elements, groups of 4 defines palete. Numbers used there are indices to NES palette.

load_sprite(sprite, ppupos)
Loads sprite into ppu. ppupos is internal ID of sprite, so you can make animated sprites by loading different sprites into same ppupos. 'sprite' must be made in header with define_sprite.
