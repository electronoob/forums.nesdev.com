Mario: Let's connect everything in the correct order and then play with the keyboard.

[How to handle the Family Computer and its peripherals.]

In order to turn on the power and start up the computer...

1) Plugging in the keyboard connector
●Have the Family Computer's POWER turned OFF and connect the keyboard's connector into the expansion connector of the Family Computer.

2) Inserting the cartridge
●Insert the cartridge into the Family Computer's cartridge connector.

3) Turning the power ON
●Turn on the POWER on the Family Computer

4) Start screen
●The computer's color panel appears on the start screen.


Regarding memory backup.........(When pulling out the cartridge from the main unit always set the switch to ON, and let it be like that until the next time the computer gives instructions to turn it OFF.)

By using AA-batteries it is possible to temporarily save things like input data from the Calculator, Music or Message Name Board or whole BASIC programs in the cartridge memory (memory backup).

●Please follow the computers directions about when to turn the backup switch ON or OFF.
●However, when in Game Basic Mode it will not display the message: 「データヲ　ノコシタイトキハ　カセットノ　バックアップスイッチヲ　ＯＮニ　シテクダサイ」 ("Turn the cartridge backup switch to ON if you want the data to remain").
In order to back up BASIC programs, please exit from GAME BASIC Mode and when the Start Screen shows up, set the backup switch to ON.
●If the computers instructions are not properly followed when using the ON/OFF backup switch, data will not back up correctly, and abnormal situations may occur so please be careful.
●When the Calculator, Music or Message Name Boards are executed the BASIC program data will unfortunately disappear. What is more, when BASIC Mode is executed the Calculator, Music, and Message Name Boards' screen data will also disappear.
●When backed up data is used, please keep the above mentioned points in mind.


Regarding changing batteries......
●The cartridge uses 2 dry cell AA batteries for memory backup. 
When setting the backup switch to ON, it's life lasts about 2 months (if using SUM-3(E) dry cell AA batteries). When set to OFF the electricity consumption rate becomes large, and the batteries' lives shortens.

●If the batteries are replaced when the cartridge is inserted to the Family Computer (main unit's power is ON), stored data, programs and such remains, but if batteries are changed when the cartridge is not inserted the data will disappear.

●Please look at "Warnings about battery-handling" on page 111.


Things that can be backed up to the cartridge......
●BASIC programs
●Calculator Board Screen data
●Music Board Screen data
●Message Board Screen data
(Caution) BG GRAPHIC Screen data can't be backed up

Things that can be SAVEd to and LOADed from cassette tapes......
●BASIC programs
●BG GRAPHIC Screen data

[Using the Calculator Board Screen]

Image captions on the left part of page 8:
Displayed functions.
<Calculation example>
<Displaying error>
TN: The 3 displayed errors are: デキマセン = "can not (calculate)",　オーバーフロー = "overflow" and　ツギノケイサンヲシナサイ
<Correcting 5 into 6>
It is also possible to make mathematical exercises.


Mario: If you enter a formula the computer will answer. You can use the whole screen for your calculations.

Move the quill pen and calculations will be displayed. Calculations may be made on a width of 24 characters and a height of 8 lines.

Basic rules of the calculator
-------
Formula

The four usual arithmetic operators as well as calculations with brackets may be used. When calculating with brackets, in a single layer bracket, up to 10 brackets may be used within one formula.
TN: If there are brackets within the bracket it's not a single layer bracket anymore right? It's confusing, I have to check it in the game.
-------
Permitted math

Up to 8 digits may be calculated. Truncations are made to 8 digits or less. ±(99999999～0.0000000)
-------
Symbols

+ - × ÷ ( ) . = may be entered using the function keys.
-------
Calculations priority

In the following order: ①Whatever is within ( ) ②× and ÷③+ and -. If the two expressions have the same priority then the first one on that line will be calculated first.
-------

Entering formulas...

●When entering numbers and symbols with the character and function keys, the quill pen will write the formula.
●When entering an = (equal sign), the answer will appear. After the quill pen has answered the characters will move apart in a one character long space.
●When the [RETURN] key is pressed, the quill pen will make a new line. Also when typing the last character on a line (the 24th) it will automatically make a new line.

-------
Ａ・・・Many calculations can be made on the same line.
Ｂ・・・A formula may span two lines or more.
Ｃ・・・A negative number following a operator sign will be put into brackets.
Ｄ・・・A one character or more long space are needed before and after each formula. The same goes even after a new line.
Ｅ・・・Messages may also be typed.
Ｆ・・・If there is a space in a formula the part before the space will not be calculated.
Ｇ・・・If it is not possible to display the answer in 8 lines, it will be displayed on the 9th.
-------

★In the following cases there will be errors.
-------
Ｈ・・・If there is a character other than a number or operator sign in a formula.
Ｉ・・・If an expression that does not turn into a formula is followed by an = (equal sign).
Ｊ・・・If there is a space before an = (equal sign).
Ｋ・・・If the result of a calculation exceeds 8 columns ("オーバーフロー" "over flow" will be displayed).
Ｌ・・・If typing a message until the end of a line, making a new line and typing a formula without a space in between.
-------

When correcting a part of a formula...
●Move the quill pen with the [▴][▾][◂][▸] keys to correct already written formulas. Since the = (equal sign) will be disappear, please enter it again.
●Using the [INS] or [DEL] key, it is possible to stick in or remove numbers or operator signs in already written formulas.
●If a new answer is calculated and other formulas are stacked behind the original formula, the formulas behind will be erased.
※It is also possible to make math exercises like on the picture to the left. When an = (equal sign) are typed the answer will appear. Please check if your results are correct.

-------
●Erasing the whole screen is done by holding [SHIFT] key and then pressing the [CLR HOME] key.
●When you want to quit from the Calculator Board Screen, please press the [ESC] key.

Mario: When typing characters or symbols, Mario, Lady and various other characters may make an appearance.

Let's use the memory backup.

1. Message Board
"From Mama to Papa", "From Papa to me", "From me to Mama"... please write all kinds of messages to people.

2. Informal Record Board
Use it as "Allowance Journal", "Shopping List" or other such memos.

3.Character Typing Exercise.
This keyboard has the same key layout as a typewriter for alphanumerics and symbols. You can practice your ability to move your fingers around fast and accurately on the keyboard.

The quill pen moves and messages are displayed.
(Width 24 characters × 17 lines)

The computer's fortune telling

[Using the fortune telling screen]
Mario: If you greet the computer it will do a fortune telling for you.

●[H][E][L][L][O][RETURN]
●[オ][ハ][ヨ][ウ][RETURN]
●[コ][ン][ニ][チ][ハ][RETURN]
●[コ][ン][バ][ン][ハ][RETURN]
●[F3][RETURN]
upon entering any of the above commands, the computer will greet you back and give you a fortune telling.
●When the computer asks you 「ウラナイヲ　シマスカ？」("Should I do a fortune telling?") please type either [ハイ][RETURN] or [F1][RETURN].
●When entering your birth date and the day you wants to predict, the computer will tell you what to expect that day and it will also accurately tell you how many days has passed since you were born.

How to enter your birth date...
●Enter the year in AD or Japanese era like the following.
AD → type with 4 digits. 1984
Era name →
Meiji-------Ｍ１～Ｍ４４
Taishō-------Ｔ１～Ｔ１４
Shōwa-------Ｓ１～Ｓ９９９
※Please make Meiji 45 into Taishō 1 and Taishō 15 into Shōwa 1.
※Please type in non-number characters or spaces between the year, month and day.

(E.g.)
1984/12/23
S59_6_23

●The scope of the prediction is between 1868 (first year of Meiji) and 2924 (Shōwa 999).

TN: When this game was made the Shōwa era had not yet ended (it ended 1989 January 7) and the Heisei era had not yet started, so those who are born after the Shōwa era will have to use the AD format.


This fortune telling is based on biorhythm. Your state of health, emotion, intelligence, whether you are on high or low spirits, an evaluation on what days requires special attention, and such results that especially stands out will be displayed.

※When pressing [F1] through [F7] keys, ド～シ (DO through SI) notes will be displayed and the tone will be heard.
※When pressing [F1] through [F7] keys while holding [SHIFT], C through B notes will be displayed and a half-tone higher tone will be heard.

Making corrections to the scale...

●Use the [▴][▾][◂][▸] cursor keys to move the quill pen to the part that needs to be corrected.
●To make corrections while the music is playing, press [CLR HOME] key and the quill pen will move from the inkwell to the upper left part of the screen. Make the corrections by moving the quill pen to the part that needs to be corrected with the [▴][▾][◂][▸] keys.

Enjoying the musical performance...

●By pressing [F8] key, the quill pen will be set into the inkwell and the performance will start.
●While upper, middle and lower notes are played, the cursor moves to the right and indicates what part is currently being played.
●If the [◂][▸] keys are pressed during the performance, the FAST<--[-]--->SLOW cursor may be moved in order to adjust the playing speed.
[◂]...Fast	[▸]...Slow
●If the [SPACE] key is pressed, the performance will stop. For every press of the [◂][▸] keys, the Playing Scale will move 1 cell left or right. Please press the [F8] key if you want to start the performance again.
●If the [F8] key is pressed during the performance, it will start over from the beginning.
※By using the microphone on controller [II], you can have a karaoke session.

Inputting notes on the scale...

When inputting notes on the scale, the Play Scale will not move.
----------
1. The quill pen points at the first note on the upper part of the first line. Move the quill pen to the position you want to make an input to with the [▴][▾][◂][▸] cursor keys.
----------
2. Once the position has been decided, the note is inputted with the function keys.
●Every function key between [F1]～[F7] corresponds to one of the notes between ド～シ (DO through SI).
●By holding [SHIFT] and pressing the [F1]～[F7] function keys, the [C]～[B] notes that are a half-tone higher will be inputted.
----------
3. When a note is inputted at the quill pen's position, the quill pen will move one cell to the right.
●When you don't want to input a note you can make a empty space with the [SPACE] key.
----------
4. When the quill pen reaches the end of the first line (the 24th cell), it will move to the first note of the next line.
----------
5. Writing the $ repeat sign. In order to make a song repeat, the $ mark is inputted. Whether it's placed in the upper, middle or lower part of the column doesn't matter.
----------

*Using the character keys, it's possible to make much more complicated compositions.

●Inputting the [1][2][3][4][5][6][7] numbers on the upper part of the column, produces a mid-frequency sound.
●Inputting [1][2][3][4][5][6][7] on the middle part of the column, produces a high-frequency sound.
●Inputting [1][2][3][4][5][6][7] on the lower part of the column, produces a lower and lower sound. Every number is one octave lower than the previous one.
TN: I'm not sure if this is correct.
●Each one of the [ア][イ][ウ][エ][オ][ナ][ニ] (a i u e o na ni) katakana produces a half-tone higher sound between 1～7.
※By using the character keys it's possible to produce 4 octaves worth of sound.
●By using the [INS][DEL] keys, you can stick in new notes on to the scale or remove ones that are already written to it.

-------
●Erasing the whole screen is done by holding [SHIFT] key and then pressing the [CLR HOME] key.

GAME BASIC
It's finally time to explain how to use "GAME BASIC" to make your very own original games. Just by using the advantageous features of Family BASIC to make programs easily, you will soon be able to make Mario, Lady and the characters move around and enjoy playing with it. But first please memorize very fundamental programs.

--------
The explanation goes in the following order:

1]Introduction
●BASIC
How to make programs where Mario, Lady and other characters appear on screen, change colours, move around among other things.
●BG GRAPHIC (abbreviation of BACKGROUND GRAPHIC) - How to draw backgrounds and images.
●BASIC and BG GRAPHIC - How to combine animated characters and backgrounds.
※By coming this far you may have mastered all the basics already. Now it's just a matter of replacing the letters, numbers and symbols in the code and you will be able to make your own original games.

2]Grammar
A detailed explanation of every command (instruction) that Family BASIC uses. Please look here if there is something you don't understand when you are writing code.

3] Game Program
Game exercises can be found here. Please make use of them.

※If the computer's condition becomes incomprehensible when you are writing code, please look at the bottom part of page 19.
--------

※This BASIC is making use of the Family Computer's features to the maximum. It's our original product. (It's not for ordinary business use.)
※If you prefer a more detailed explanation of the fundamental commands, please refer to the "Introduction to BASIC" chapter.

Introduction to BASIC

※This Family BASIC comes with a "Character Map" insert. It is a map (sheet) of Character Table A that can be found at the back cover of the instruction manual, Character Table B and Colour Chart that can be found at page 113.
At a glance you can see all the animated characters, the characters used for backgrounds and all the colour combinations. It's very handy when writing programs. Please refer to it.

CALL
[Working] Calls machine language subroutines directly.
[Grammar] CALL address
Address → execution start address of the subroutine.
[Abbreviation] CA.
[Explanation] Calls machine language subroutines using the specified address as the execution start address. The address is specified with a hexadecimal literal (in this form &H○○○○ where ○ are numbers), a decimal integer literal （between -３２７６８～+３２７６７） or an integer variable expression. Please place the machine language subroutine after the address specified with the CLEAR statement.
