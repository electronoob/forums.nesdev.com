		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Hello, I am a massive nooby, I have just bought a GQ-4X Eprom programmer from MCUmall, I have read these 4 pages and you guys are often referring to an adapter for programming specific eproms.
<br />
<br />I want to make my own secret of mana 2 cartridge PAL and I have bought seiken densetsu 3 JAP, now I have bought the GX-4X and will buy a soldering iron very soon (any tips on a decent soldering iron would be great also)
<br />
<br />The 27C801's are all I am familiar with, never held one, just seen pics, now the golden question...
<br />
<br />Can I plug the 27C801's directly into the GQ-4X emprom programmer or do I need this custom adapter, any info would be appreciated as I have spent alot of money so far and I don't even know if I can do this, I am just desperate to play Secret of mana 2 and I have never even played a ROM before, wanna play on my SNES with a friend, thanks for your help.

<br />I just can't find a working donor PCB.

<br />I know Super Mario world uses the same as NCAA basketball but that one has 32 pins not 36 and Im using the AM290f32b's 
<br />
<br />Plus Mario return to dinosaur is 2.0 megabytes, anyone had success with this one?
<br />
<br />I was thinking using NHL standley cup

<br />
<br />That is because that game needs 64k of SRAM.  According to my records, it originally came on an SHVC-1A3B board.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />So I probably had it full working, but I missed your advice on checking the dump. That was a good idea. Too bad I already blanked the good chip.  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" /> Now my programmer is on the fritz...<br /><br />So I'm getting back to this. Had a heck of a time solding another chip today. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_lol.gif" alt=":lol:" title="Laughing" /><br /><br />I'm also getting the weirdest behavior. So, my GQ-4X ID'ed my chips correctly (the known good and the new one). I blanked the new one, and then BLAM. It won't ID any more. So strange. Hoping to wrap the technical part of this project up tonight. I finished my rom changes a couple months ago, and I need to finish this thing up. Hopefully I'll find some success tonight!

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Ug. Okay. I've tried the following versions of the software this evening:<br /><br />5.03B<br />6.13C<br />6.16<br /><br />None of them will ID any of my chips. :\ I can Erase/Write a couple of the chips. The other one still doesn't work (as expected). The previously working chip no longer runs after Double Write @ -2. The new chip does the same. It &quot;writes&quot; @ -1/-2, but when read, then entire chip is &quot;FF&quot;. Tried both with and without external power as well. Disappointing. I'll have to look into this again tomorrow.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Would anyone who already has all the right equipment be interested in making up 29F032 mounted on a TSOP to DIP36 with the desired ROM already burned into it for a fee?<br /><br />Seems to me getting the burner and ironing out all the quirks is not worth it unless you are going to be doing this for dozens of games. Me, I am only going to need about 10 or so of Super Famicom game purchases modded for personal use.<br /><br />I'll be getting the original title on a future trip to Japan and I am more than capable of opening up the carts, removing the old rom chip and soldering in a 29F032 mounted on a TSOp to DIP36.<br /><br />It is the whole burning process that is holding me back. Rather than investing money in the equipment that I am not going to need after a handful of uses I rather pay that out to someone experienced that can get the burning done for me.<br /><br />If anyone is up for it then PM me your total per unit price.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />So I'm at it again. <br /><br />Reinstalled Windows last go round. No change. So it's not a software problem.<br /><br />I've soldered up a new adapter board today. Just in case. No change.<br /><br />So far the only part that I haven't actually remade is the extended address adapter that came with the GQ-4X. Which I assume is behaving fine based on a continuity check passing on a previous bout of debugging.<br /><br />The only response from the official support board for the GQ-4X was to use the official adapter to write to the chips. That's fine an dandy if you don't mind desoldering TSOP40's every time you want to write to them while debugging. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" /> <br /><br />I don't have two GQ-4X's, so I have no means of determining if the unit itself is behaving correctly. Software checks in USBPrg check out fine. :\
