Whatever comes in before the deadline qualifies.  Submit whatever you like, in whatever state you wish.  If there is only one submission in that category you could win.  Obviously the better it is, the better chance of winning you will have.  Hopefully there will be enough entries that we won't have to award a prize to something whipped up in 20 minutes.<br /><br />It's your game, you can do what you want with it.  This is a fun competition, not a legal obligation.  The only thing to keep in mind, is if you plan on making it a RetroUSB release, it might hurt your sales if someone can freely download the rom.  I guess we can remove it from the site by request, but the idea is to have a place to download these games.  If everyone wanted their roms private, then it would kind of ruin the spirit of the whole thing.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=4091">WhatULive4</a> — Tue Jan 11, 2011 12:01 pm</p><hr />

For older homebrew stuff (and newer) <a href="http://nesworld.com/homebrew.php" class="postlink">NESWorld</a> has a nice layout and a very comprehensive library.  I'm sure once the entries for this contest are posted, they will end up on that site as well.  <br /><br />As for utilities/tools/editors, there are so many out there it would be a PITA to keep the updated versions on the site.  I don't want to lose the simplicity of the site, but will definitely add a "Interested in more Homebrew?" page with plenty of links to other sources.<br /><br />As for the nesdev homepage, I never look at it.  Since the info was added to the wiki, I see no need for it.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=4091">WhatULive4</a> — Tue Jan 11, 2011 10:11 am</p><hr />

<div class="quotetitle">clueless wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"><br />Although "challenge" (programming difficulty) deserves its place, I think that games should be judged by the following criteria (not all-inclusive, just my current idea list) and not how hard it was to create:<br /><br /><ol style="list-style-type: decimal"><li>Originality or Novelty (yeah, I'll flunk this one for sure)</li><li>Player control (poor play control = teh suks)</li><li>Replay value (is it fun to play again after you've beaten it?)</li><li>Sound effects (bad ones suck more than good ones rock, imho)</li><li>Graphics - Do they match the theme of the game?

But - I want to run this by everyone before I put it into the rules:<br /><br />Judging (by the mentioned criteria) would be done by the developers who have submitted an entry, and by a small panel of judges selected by the organizers (Whatulive4 and me, I suppose) - no volunteers.  This is to reduce self-select bias, somewhat.<br /><br />Public voting could be held on a simpler scale, maybe 1 thru 10 overall for each entry.  Sounds dumb I know, but the point being that we want the public to vote, and I think more votes (by making it easier to vote) could be more interesting than a smaller number of detailed votes.<br /><br />At the risk of a minor revolt, then the prizes would be award based on the judges' voting, and of course public voting results and comments would be available for informational purposes.<br /><br />But maybe it isn't all that unreasonable to have everyone fill out a longer form.  Guess it depends on how many entries there are.  I don't know exactly how to code a PHP/database thing to accept the votes, I'm sure I could if I sat down to do it, but hopefully someone can help out with that.<br /><br />If someone else wants to count the votes (I'm hoping I don't have to), then feel free to change that setup, just let us all know what to expect.<br /><br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">WhatULive4 wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"><br /><div class="quotetitle">Memblers wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">Yeah, I didn't finish writing the description for that, but the main reason for that is mostly to allow folks to show off their stuff that might not qualify otherwise.

If desired, I can link to the tools each user used if they would like.<br /></div><br /><br />In a logical sense it does belong here, but it doesn't help that the main index page of this site is so outdated.  Linking to the forums is discouraging because forums in general are about the worst place to download files (because of rampant dead links and "free download, wait 60 seconds" type of crap).  Or maybe the version you want is only linked on page 25 of 37 of the thread, etc.  Not that this forum is always like that, but that's what I expect to see on forums in general.<br /><br />Since this type of compo has never been done before, that's a part of the reason for the general section.  Obviously it shouldn't automatically have every ROM made in the past 10 years, but if someone wants to submit their old stuff, why not?  If everyone here has seen it, and everyone on Nintendoage, that is still a very small percentage of the people who might stop by to visit the compo site.<br /><br />I think a lot of people will want to see this compo, that don't even want to visit nesdev or nintendoage and probably never will, so the more the site can stand on it's own, the better.  My line of thinking too is that it's not just attention whoring for it's own sake - it's to get more people interested in this stuff, whether they play the games, program games, or just think it's cool that there is a map/level editor or music tracker they can use without being a developer themselves.<br /><br />Maybe my ideas are a bit overboard, I would accept that as an answer, haha.  The website looks pretty cool so far.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=10">Memblers</a> — Tue Jan 11, 2011 9:45 am</p><hr />

Hello Everyone.  The following is just my opinion.  I am certainly not trying to tell the contest leadership how things should be done.  I just wanted to share my thoughts.<br /><br /><br />Although "challenge" (programming difficulty) deserves its place, I think that games should be judged by the following criteria (not all-inclusive, just my current idea list) and not how hard it was to create:<br /><br /><ol style="list-style-type: decimal"><li>Originality or Novelty (yeah, I'll flunk this one for sure)</li><li>Player control (poor play control = teh suks)</li><li>Replay value (is it fun to play again after you've beaten it?)</li><li>Sound effects (bad ones suck more than good ones rock, imho)</li><li>Graphics - Do they match the theme of the game?  Are they cool?</li></ol><br /><br />Is the goal of the compo to produce a good batch of fun homebrew games, or to show off programming machismo?  <br /><br />The judging criteria (and suggested game complexity categories) should reflect the intent of the contest.<br /><br />For Graphics and Sound, it is tempting to judge based on how far one "pushed" the PPU and APU.  That would be fine criteria for a tech demo, and would make a great category.  However, I would hate to fail a great game because the graphics were blaze and not blazing.<br /><br />-OR- have have multiple different categories that each game can be judged in.   Maybe 1st, 2nd and 3rd places for each judging category (that spans all games entered) and then a "best of show" within each game type category?<br /><br />For example, I would like my game to be judged on its replay value and player control, but because I'm trying to capture the 2600 retro feel, I am purposefully NOT pushing the PPU very far.<br /><br />I guess that I'm thinking of this more like a professional dog or cat show.  The animals are not compared with each other, but rather compared to a "breed standard".  The top winners are the animals that most closely match the breed standard, not which is fastest, tallest, smartest, etc...<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3664">clueless</a> — Tue Jan 11, 2011 8:19 am</p><hr />

Are we expecting a big turnout?<br /></div><br /><br />Nah, not expecting a big turnout.  The setup is hopefully to get the best results - most people want to do NROM, but if we limit it to that only, then we're only possibly reducing the number of entries in the end.  IMHO, if "NES Programs" category has a bunch of entries, and the "Freestyle" has one entry that wins 1st place by default, I see a gain there - no loss.  As I mentioned before, I'll foot the bill for the prize of the freestyle category (assuming the offer I was matching for the other category still stands - I'm sure it does, but I can't afford both as easily).<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=10">Memblers</a> — Tue Jan 11, 2011 8:08 am</p><hr />
