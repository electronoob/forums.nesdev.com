Everything that has its own update logic every frame is called an &quot;entity&quot; in my engines, there is no distinction. They have flags for whether they draw or not and their behavior and interaction and so on is entirely up to the implementation of a given entity.<br /><br />However I've seen folks in other game development websites distinguish entity from actor in certain ways, but in the end it appears to be an entirely arbitrary choice.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />&quot;Dog&quot; doesn't have any acronymic meaning in my game. It's just the word I've chosen. Partly I just wanted it to be short, because I'd be typing it a lot. (There is a &quot;lizard&quot; for the player but it's not a subclass of &quot;dog&quot;.)<br /><br />I saw &quot;bob&quot; in some game engine once but I forget where. On the Amiga there was a &quot;bob&quot; that meant <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blitter_object" class="postlink">&quot;blitter object&quot;</a> that has a similar meaning to &quot;sprite&quot;, so perhaps it was building on that idea, but it also doesn't really have to mean <em>anything</em>.

This was interesting to me because for my first two games, the main character(s) were entirely separate from the entity system, however in my current game I chose to make the main character part of the entity system itself---it's just always the first one spawned. I'm not certain there is any particular benefit to doing it differently this time except maybe one or two fewer jsr's in the main loop. Plus it shares various bits of plumbing with the rest of the entity system this time around (i.e. animation system based on structures of arrays, in previous engines I had two parallel animation systems...so now I have less code to maintain.)

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />That's a very situational question. Sometimes it makes a lot of sense to do that, and sometimes not. A lot of times it doesn't really matter much either way. ...and there are also lots of ways to share code between things without them being the same &quot;class&quot;.<br /><br />The way you choose prioritize things and order the updates between various things can bear on this, for example: Does the player always update first? Does everything else update in a specific order?

I think i picked it up from game maker a decade ago or so.</div><br />That terminology is a bit at odds with prevailing practice, I think.<br /><br />In C++ and many other programming languages, an &quot;object&quot; is an &quot;instance&quot; of a &quot;class&quot;.<br /><br />So, your use of &quot;instance&quot; is normal, but what you're calling an &quot;object&quot; is a class, and thet word normally refers to an instance. After looking it up, I guess I should say &quot;Game Maker&quot; rather than you, since this is indeed the unfortunate way Game Maker has chosen to define these terms. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" alt=":(" title="Sad" /><br /><br />The more conventional definitions:<br /><br /><ul><li><strong>class</strong>: a template or &quot;type&quot; for making objects, the code for an object belongs to its class because the same code can run every instance.</li><li><strong>instance</strong>: when you use a class to make a new object, you get an instance of that class. Each one contains its own set of data.</li><li><strong>object</strong>: an instance of a class, synonymous with instance but I think the word <em>instance</em> is used more in contexts where it's important to note that it is <em>one of many</em> like it.</li></ul><br />For confusion's sake: in Java there is a class called Object, and you can make Object object instances of it.
