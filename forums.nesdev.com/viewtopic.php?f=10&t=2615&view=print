How exactly to make the 6502 tell the NES to do things, there are a few document on that. NESTech, by y0shi, is really technical, but it's pretty much the reference that everyone looks at when they need to know about an aspect of the NES. I hear that NES101 is a good one (Though I have never read it), and that's a tutorial, unlike NESTech. If you come across GBAguy's tutorials, they aren't accurate at all, but they get you at least inch off the ground.
<br />
<br />Oh, and I prefer to use WLA-DX, though most people here use CC65, for an assembler.
<br />
<br />As to why you should program the NES, why were you wondering how to, if you didn't know why you should?

<br /><a href="http://home.pacbell.net/michal_k/6502.html" class="postlink">http://home.pacbell.net/michal_k/6502.html</a>
<br />
<br />Here is a link on nesdev for a great overview of the instructions, and what they do
<br />
<br /><a href="http://nesdev.com/6502guid.txt" class="postlink">http://nesdev.com/6502guid.txt</a>
<br />
<br />There are some great 6502 tutorials for the C64, which might be a bit easier to learn some basic assembly before diving into the NES.  Chapter 5 of the c64 programming manual is a good start
<br />
<br /><a href="http://project64.c64.org/hw/c64prg10.zip" class="postlink">http://project64.c64.org/hw/c64prg10.zip</a>
<br />
<br />After you feel you are comfortable with 6502, and can write a few basic routines to do multiplication, counters, etc. then start going over some of the NES technical docs, and the NES 101 tutorial.  Come up with some simple projects for yourself like displaying a string of characters on the screen.
<br />
<br />NES development is going to require a lot of time and dedication.  It isn't like gba development where you can have some sprites moving around, with input and sound working after spending 3 or 4 hours on a tutorial.  I started about 1 month ago, and I don't even have backgrounds or sprites working yet  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />

<br />You should learn 6502 assembler in order to emulate a NES. I don't know much about your background, but are you sure that you want to write a NES emulator?

<br />
<br />As a newbie myself, it might also be helpful to let you know what NOT to do.
<br />
<br />You probably dont want to use nesbasic as a programming language.  For that matter, you probably dont want C (as in cc65.  You will want its assembler though).  6502 assembly language is what you want, and as someone indicated earlier the type of asembler is your choice (ca65 is my personal choice).  You probably dont want to use nesasm.  A lot of pople have posted reasons they dont like it.
<br />
<br />Dont use the tutorial written by GBAGuy.  A number of people have posted mistakes in it.
<br />
<br />Dont use an in-accurate emulator.

<br />Where "regularly" may be limited severely by access to an NES and devcart, of course...

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Cooper's right; I think the C=64 Programmer's Reference Guide has the best freely available 6502 introduction out there. And yeah, you pretty much do have to test your code on real hardware to find out if it works (which is why I'm in the middle of trying to build an FDSLoadr cable...an approach that I'd recommend if you don't want to try and build a devcart.) As for NES-specific learning, the way I learned what I know, though probably not the best way for a lot of people, was just to pore over Yoshi's nestech doc, Firebug's mapper information, and Brad Taylor's sound reference until I understood it.
