I just checked the japanese pasofami page and it started in 1995 for windows version.  The guy still sell, I mean, you can "register" it.<br /><br />Was it the first one? Good question.  He's talking on another page somewhere about the Pasofami with the FM-Town in 1992. Does that mean that before the PC version, he already was working on an emulator on that computer? Seems like it. Because it talk "because of the popularity of it, the windows version was made" (本ソフトの前身は FM TOWNS で好評の「パソファミ」で、これはその Windows 版です).<br /><br />So this could be actually the oldest one if this is the case if you don't take into consideration the platform.<br /><br />Here's the links, in japanese:<br /><a href="http://hp.vector.co.jp/authors/VA005758/" class="postlink">Main page</a><br /><a href="http://www.geocities.jp/pasofami77/pasgai.htm" class="postlink">Some talk about the emulator</a><p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3559">Banshaku</a> — Fri Aug 27, 2010 8:28 pm</p><hr />

I think everything ran well except ZSNES might have needed some settings tweaking like 8bit color mode, as 16bit supporting color blending effects was too slow on the computer.

The first one I remember using was Pasofami (1996/7?) then nesticle came. I had a 486 dx33 at the time.  There were some talk about some snes emulator before them but it was not working. Maybe it was the emulator mentioned above. I think it was that one, VSMC. The name is quite familiar. <br /><br />I remember that after seeing those emulators I felt the urge of writing my own (duh). I was young and stupid  <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" /> I never worked on it.  I sent email at the time to someone that is still on this board here.

I had no clue he made NES emulators.<br /><br />According to some website I'm reading called <a href="http://www.emuwiki.com/index.php?title=The_Emulation_Timeline" class="postlink">"The Emulation Timeline"</a>, VSMC (snes emulator) existed back in September 1994, but that website doesn't list any NES emulators before 1997.

I had an IBM PS/1, quite a strange PC (had a ROM with IBM-DOS 4.0, and microchannel bus).  It had a 386sx, but I don't know what speed.  I remember NESticle was running at about half frame-rate.  Tweaking the CPU emulation settings it seemed like it would run a little faster (and break certain games too, of course).  NESA was an earlier emulator, the first one I had tried.  I never got to try iNES because I didn't have win95.<br /><br />And really when it comes to 'slowest hardware', the clock speed doesn't matter much because hardware in general can do a huge variety of things on one particular clock cycle.  I don't know if you mean PCs specifically.  But I think probably the slowest system that can emulate the NES would be the SNES, because it's extremely well-suited to it.  It would be more like a re-compiling emulator, rather than a 100% software approach.  Cutting corners. <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=10">Memblers</a> — Thu Aug 26, 2010 3:07 pm</p><hr />

I had Nesticle running on a Intel 486 based CPU PC (yeah that one with awful FM MIDI sound), that was already obsolete in the early 2000 years (I was an early teenager).<br />I don't remember the speed of the CPU, but I know that PC was made in 1994, and that was a very high-end one back then (probably why it was still functional working in the early 2000 years !). I had it working again last year when I was taking the opportunity that I bought a notebok to definitely got rid of all old desktop PCs of the house, and of course I tried Nesticle on it for nostalgia. It was a bit lagging.<br />Too bad I don't remember the CPU speed, but the PC has 16 MB RAM, and the CPU on it was probably one of the best available in the year 1994.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=38">Bregalad</a> — Thu Aug 26, 2010 2:10 pm</p><hr />

PocketNES runs on the 16.8 MHz ARM7 in a Game Boy Advance, but it helps that the GBA PPU has a video mode to which the NES PPU's display model maps fairly nicely. The GBA CPU emulates the NES CPU, the mapper chip, and about 10% of the NES PPU and APU, and the GBA PPU and APU emulate the rest.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=9">tepples</a> — Thu Aug 26, 2010 11:09 am</p><hr />
