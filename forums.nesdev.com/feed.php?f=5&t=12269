Yeah but C was usually avoided like the plague for games back then because compilers weren't exactly great at optimizing (not to mention C being quite wasteful on a machine with such low resources available, remember there's only 64KB of RAM) and a human programming in assembler still had a much bigger chance to make the code faster and taking up less memory. It was only in the mid-'90s that using C for games became more widespread.<br /><br />Sonic Spinball was made in C because the game was done in a rush (it was made specifically because they were already aware that Sonic 3 wouldn't make its way to 1993 christmas). If I recall correctly they only had 9 months of which only 6 could be spent developing. The result wasn't bad considering the constraints =P (also probably explains why there are only four levels, and why the music licensing issue was only noticed at last moment)<br /><br />I know that Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3 was programmed in C, and probably the earlier ones (in fact, I think the code from the ports are actually based on the arcade version, which most of the dumbing down being either hardware limitations or running out of ROM space). I know that the XBand firmware was programmed in C too. I imagine Hard Drivin' as well since the port had the same programmer who was hired for Sonic Spinball (no idea if it uses assembly for the drawing routines, though).<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=4526">Sik</a> — Mon Jan 19, 2015 2:04 am</p><hr />

I figured they got rid of offset per tile functionality because the floor on Yoshi's island on some of the levels doesn't warp like it used to. Why did they get rid of subtractive blending though?

So if you had a two 64x64 sprites next to each other to form a 128x64 sprite then you would only use one of the scaling/rotating perimeters? Then in that case, why did afterburner look so terrible on the GBA? The ground is so empty compared to the arcade version, but if you can use the same scaling and rotating parameters, then you could make one long horizontal strip of the ground that would cover the width of the screen, but Afterburner on the GBA appears to have everything on a separate plane from each other.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"><br />But however, the GBA BGs lacks the priority bit of the SNES, which also makes them less powerful.<br /></div><br />Meaning that, for example, the poles on the mill levels on DKC3 have to be their own BG layer?<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=6683">Espozo</a> — Sun Jan 18, 2015 8:36 am</p><hr />

<div class="quotetitle">Espozo wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"><br />With 4 256 color BGs, 128 256 color sprites (with 32 of them partaking in affine transformations) and 5x overdraw, (with a 16.8 32bit processor behind it all) I sure don't see that many ambitious GBA titles. In fact, most GBA games look like they could be easily made on the SNES. One thing I noticed is that a lot of GBA games actually do use 3 or 4 BGs, but one of them is usually used for something that could have easily have been made with sprites, like a status bar that uses 16 8x8 tiles or a vertical pole that is 16 pixels wide. (I don't think I've ever seen a GBA game even use more than 80 sprites, leaving plenty for a status bar.)<br /></div><br /><br />I don't know which games pushed the GBA, but I certainly known some that could never have similar graphics on the Super NES (without an extention chip). The SNES has only 1x overdraw, and some games such as Secret of Mana and Seiken Densetsu 3 often have sprites that disappears as they break the limit. I bet many GBA games would have this problem if ported on the SNES.<br /><br />The SNES can only have 2 16 colour BG and 1 4 colour BG at best. I know a lot of GBA games that relies on 3 or more 4 colour BG. But however, the GBA BGs lacks the priority bit of the SNES, which also makes them less powerful.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=38">Bregalad</a> — Sun Jan 18, 2015 4:44 am</p><hr />

I just find it a bit disappointing how toned down the shooters and run and guns were on that system, especially when there was no need for it to happen given the hardware. Looking at you, Metal Slug Advance! (Seriously though, why is the animation in that game so choppy? Does they game even update vram or are all the tiles for all the animations stored even when there not needed?)<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=6683">Espozo</a> — Sat Jan 17, 2015 11:22 pm</p><hr />
