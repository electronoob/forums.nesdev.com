		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Hello all,<br /><br />I'm in the planning stages to create my own adapter so I can play games with my Game Genie in my wife's toploader NES-101.  I already have a &quot;Hunt for Red October&quot; cartridge that has volunteered for this experiment.  Since, you know, the game sucked in its original intended purpose...<br /><br />My idea is to use modified floppy drive connectors and their attached ribbon cables to connect to Game Genie's extra-thick PCB and attach to HfRO's standard-sized PCB.  i already confirmed that HfRO has all the contact pins commonly found on NES carts (missing 16-20, 37, 51-56.) <br /><br />My biggest question is the easiest way to bypass the chips on the HfRO PCB.  A previous project I'd seen online had all the chips de-soldered from the donor cart's PCB.  This seems cumbersome and unneeded.  Would there be an issue as long as my ribbon cables bypass the chips and go straight to the pins?  If simply bypassing the chips doesn't work, can I simply separate the pin edge of the PCB from the rest of the board using a razor saw?  <br /><br />Thanks in advance for your help.  Hopefully I'll get this done soon and post pics!

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I suppose you could bypass the chips, except the CIC (you could leave it on there and not wire it through the Game Genie).  Cut the traces to the chip enable pins, and wire them to VCC.<br /><br />Sawing the PCB would be OK with the proper precautions, because it's fiberglass and that stuff could destroy your lungs and eyes.  If you solder to the pins, you'd have to scape off solder mask on one side of the PCB (where they're not fully exposed on Nintendo's boards)<br /><br />One easy method for desoldering through hole, is to cut the pins off (near the body of the chip), heat from the bottom and pull each pin out individually from the top with pliers.<br /><br />Not to take away from the fun of making a hand-built one, but I was wanting to make an adapter for this as well, just a simple PCB and a connector.  I could go ahead and order the parts sooner, if there's interest.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Is there a source for the correct thickness PCB with NES-style contacts already attached?  I've had the darnedest time searching for one online (although it's not hard to find the female card-edge connector through DigiKey.)<br /><br />The other solution that's been tried is to use a NES to Famicom cart adapter, plus Famicom to NES card adapter, plus Game Genie, plus NES cart.  A very cumbersome combination, but it does work without having to do any soldering.  To that end, I spent ten minutes diving through a stack of Gyromite carts at my local used game shop until I found the elusive NES to Famicom cart adapter!

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Galoob made a Game Genie adapter for the toploader, they are somewhat available but rare and on the expensive side.<br /><br />By ordering the parts, I meant ordering custom PCBs.  I've got the layout done, it would take a couple weeks to have them fabbed and shipped.
