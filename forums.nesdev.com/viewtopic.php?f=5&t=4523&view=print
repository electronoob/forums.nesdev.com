<br />Would I be able to boot Live CD's  via the Lite-On External 20x DVD+/-RW Drive with this thing? I want to use the thing as a small development utility. 
<br />Anyone have the Acer AOA150?
<br />I know... Acer Sucks, but I just fell in love with the speculations. 
<br />Even If I can't boot through that I might still get it. 
<br />Intel Atom is powerful for it's size. Especially what I want to do with it.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I recently got a Aspire One A110 with Linux.
<br />I can agree that the mouse isn't very impressive, but as I type more than I click that's not much of a concern to me ;)
<br />
<br />But something that I found a bit annoying was that the supplied Linux distro (Linplus - some customized thing by Acer based on Fedora 8) was a bit crippled for people like me that want to do more things than check the mail, watch youtube and write on the next big novel.
<br />First problem I found was that Acer had customized a few things breaking compatibility with Fedora making it a pain to install certain programs (in my case Pidgin and VLC).
<br />
<br />So as anyone interested in computers would do, I went ahead and installed another distro (Xubuntu in my case) on it, unfortunately it didn't work out-of-the-box so I had to do some config to get wifi working and the status LED isn't activated.
<br />
<br />But except for that I think it's a great little machine, perfect to bring along when I'm travelling or when I want to code a bit in bed or whatever ;)
<br />Haven't tried how well it works for SNES deving yet, hopefully there wont be any problems, just have to install wine so I can use Geiger's Snes9x Debugger. Have to try how well bsnes works with it too.

<br /> 
<br /> Messed around with it a little.  It appearanly will boot off of a USB disc drive. Floppy/CD/DVD. which ever you set Cmos to boot off.
<br />This is a pretty powerful little piece of technology. Especially since the CPU is roughly the size of a us penny.(More so smaller) 
<br />I'm just gonna go ahead and reinstall Windows to get rid of all that trial  and preinstalled bullcrap and add FreeDos to it.
<br />
<br />BTW, anyone know a good method to extract an ISO onto an SD card. 
<br />It'll boot off those too. 
<br />I've heard someone put a MacOS X disc image onto and SD card and installed it to the Linux model that uses 8G SDD as storage.

<br />Why did you get that? I hear the Solid State Drive is damn slow. They usually are though. You could have probably just bought the Windows version and put in your own distro, but oh well... Who am I to talk?

<br />And it's not like I need more than 8GB for the system anyway.
<br />
<br />edit: oh and after some struggling with dependencies I got bsnes running on it, unfortantly it's not running full speed, I guess with some tweaking of the sytem I could probably get it to run a bit faster.. but as it's for development/testing "on the road" I don't need full speed.

<br />I understood immediately, as I take the city bus to and from the mall. Until I got my Eee PC and put Ubuntu on it, I could only jot down high-level designs; now I can (in theory) write and test code.
