<br />
<br />Everything I said was warranted and since it appears I must, I'll spend the next hour writing out the points:
<br />
<br />-Your "colorful" writing <em>style</em> is not pretentious, this is: "you've probably never seen anywhere else" as is your disclaimer, as is the use of the word "comprehensive" and telling your audience to "enjoy" [your work]. 
<br />
<br />-You act strangely biased against the official schematic (even though at least 6 of Enri's schematics are made redundant by it), yet have it in your archive. Particularly before your edit you had stressed its commonality--which doesn't matter from an educational standpoint. You also nitpick(ed) the schematic's low quality and incompleteness, which I found ludicrous, so I made a statement about it.
<br />
<br />-You are not alone in having access to exotic Japanese sites or the ability to use a web translator so it would be wise to not presume. I for one found the site through SMS Power, an English-language site which links it on the homepage.
<br />
<br />-What you have (/had) to gain was reputation from your "work" in either community. You seek credit in this very thread: "please only credit me for them as a contributor", coincidentally being modest after I posted my reply to the other message board.
<br />
<br />-Regarding the oscillator thread: I too have the disability of being a "westerner" and I have no problem making out the kana. But I have a history with the language. Some of the kanji is illegible to someone without the ability infer the radicals (such as myself) but the text is irrelevant here; your explanation made no sense. I strongly suggest learning some electrical theory and terminology instead of sharing your own reasoning and language. Lack of knowledge isn't an excuse for a disability, but fabricating stuff like that which wastes everybody's time, including your own, is sure a sign of one.
<br />
<br />Bottom line: to avoid "confusion" in future discussions you should cite sources for work collected by you or stop promoting and publishing unfinished projects when they still have dubious integrity. It would be very wise to *demonstrate* your motives, using the sources you collect from as an example, for any other knuckleheaded readers.
<br />
<br />I had my fun, I'm done.

<br />I wish PC file managers and web browsers had better support for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fork_%28filesystem%29" class="postlink">alternate data streams</a> so that any downloaded file would be marked with the URL of the page it was linked from, so that I could cite that as a source. Right now, browsers just save a marker that a a document has been downloaded so that Windows Explorer can show an extra dialog box before running an executable. Netscape came close in the Mac OS 8 days, storing a URL in the "comment" in the desktop database.

<br />And it was great. Perhaps it will resurge with database-driven file managers.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I've been thinking more about this and realized that you, Xious, put some time into finding the images and making them available, and figured you would share that with us. You renamed them so they would have a consistent scheme (as I often do with things I download). In the midst of combing the web for them, you hadn't made notes of the source (again, I rarely note the URLs of things I download). And then your act of sharing was pissed on with a rude reply.
<br />
<br />I regret having posted anything to this thread in the first place. Sorry.

<br />
<br />It doesn't come up often, but it seems fine with me to credit someone for contributing obscure info.  Only thing that comes to mind is fascinating Ntd_8bit.jpg Famicom schematic.  A Brazilian dude sent it to me (IIRC, he was building a Famiclone computer).  I gave the credit since it was asked for, totally appropriate.  So now he's <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=ubaldo+prones" class="postlink">famous</a> for it, heheh.
