<br />
<br />I have a complete MYSQL dump if someone wants to setup a new version however, there will be a lot of sensitive information in those mysql records I'm sure a lot of the ex-users will still appreciate their privacy so I'm lothe to actually give the dumps out.
<br />
<br />Maybe I could host the forums on a Temp domain.

If we can come to an agreement, I have all the necessary resources to have the public information back online rather quickly, CopyCon.org is already set up to accept the data. Whatever you need as proof of my trustworthiness, feel free to ask anytime.

<br />
<br />You will probably need to plug the MySQL backup blob/files into a MySQL engine and either delete/overwrite the offending columns or make a view(s) and redump the data.
<br />
<br />two or three well SQL commands could do it.
<br />
<br />Odds are you may even be able to purge most of the stuff from the profiles/user tables and still have integrity. (Rip out; Email/Realnames/MSN/AIM/ICQ/Address/DOB/Whatever) 
<br />
<br />Leave the User IDs/Alias Intact but simply nullify the columns that contain the sensitive data. Also if possible flag the users account to be made 'disabled/inactive'.

I do not want to bring back useless threads and long obsolete discussion. From there, I think good information can be extracted, paraphrased (with proper credits if applicable) to another medium (text or wiki) and then discarded leaving only historic threads which aren't suitable for wikification. I can't think of many examples of these however. All else IMO should be purged.

<br />
<br />Heres an idea:
<br />
<br />Copy a 'cleaned' (no-personal info) version of the DB and set that up as a 'historical archive' forum with limited access.
<br />
<br />Pick a bunch of 'Curators' to go through the threads and reconstruct the important stuff; 
<br />
<br />A Wiki would be neat, I assume however that copycon.org has lots of local storage available, as this stuff gets big fast.
<br />
<br />That should minimize the bandwidth use and keep things nice and tidy.

<br />I came across a post at <a href="http://www.vintagecomputing.com/index.php/archives/38" class="postlink">http://www.vintagecomputing.com/index.php/archives/38</a> made in 2005 with links to cherryroms, where aparantly there was some discussion on getting a Jaz drive working with a WildCard DX2
<br />
<br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">#  Guy Says:<br />December 5th, 2005 at 8:13 pm<br /><br />The Datatank is a parallel IDE enclosure that uses the Kingbyte version 1 chipset, which is the only kind of parallel IDE enclosure that the DX2 supports. You can find them on Ebay, but I havenâ€™t seen any for about half a year now. Here is a thread at CherryRoms detailing the parallel IDE devices that work with the DX2:<br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.cherryroms.com/viewtopic.php?t=4260">http://www.cherryroms.com/viewtopic.php?t=4260</a><!-- m --><br /><br />You can also use SCSI devices with the DX2.

Though there are limitations, as stated in the above threads. The Zip drive support for the DX2 is actually via a parallel SCSI protocol, used by the chipset in DX2 compatible Zip drives. The cool part is that this same chipset can be purchased separately as a small SCSI to parallel adapter. With this, you can attach FAT16 formatted SCSI devices to your DX2. Interesting devices include, but are not limited to:<br /><br />1. 250MB SCSI Zip drive<br />2. 1GB SCSI Jaz drive<br />â€¦<br /><br />So you arenâ€™t limited to 100MB SCSI disks. There are limitations though. If you use the DX2 to format the device, it will result in a 100MB format, so you have to format the disks on a PC first, which isnâ€™t a problem. Also, there are issues with using the DX2 to write to a format larger than 1GB. Others have tested 1GB Jaz disks without problems. I personally tested 2GB Jaz disks and had problems, though the DX2 could read the drive.</div>
<br />
<br />I'm really curious to see what technical information was discussed.
<br />
<br />Cheers

<br />Didn't know this <img src="./images/smilies/icon_surprised.gif" alt=":o" title="Surprised" />
<br />It indeed would be very intressting to read more about.
<br />btw. has anyone ever tried to disassemble the BIOS of the DX2? I'm been thinking about if it would be possible to extend the BIOS with FAT32 and long filename support as I hate the 8+3 names. So if anyone knows anything about the BIOS and wether there is room for I'd like to know <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />

<br />This may be of use to other SWCDX2 owners.
<br />
<br />Recoil, you may want to consider releasing the archive to someone else if you are busy with other obligations and don't have time. (I have servers in a data center with good bandwidth and many years of sysadmin experience, including MYSQL administration; and would be willing to invest some time in restoring it or even just lending a helping hand. I bet there are other folks around here that do too)
