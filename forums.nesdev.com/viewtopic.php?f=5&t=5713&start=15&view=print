		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />The NESDEV logo looks terrible though. As a matter of fact the adaptation that was made for the Wiki logo does too.
<br />
<br />A while ago I was working on a high-resolution version of the logo, with a transparent background, so it would look much better. I know it would kill the effect of it looking like something displayed by the NES, and it isn't actual 3D, it's just a 2D image drawn over the old one to look 3D.
<br />
<br />This is as far as I got:
<br />
<br /><img src="http://img266.imageshack.us/img266/5306/nesdev1.png" alt="Image" />
<br />
<br />Then I started again because I wanted a higher resolution (this is 12% of the original) and I wanted to include the url, but I didn't finish it:
<br />
<br /><img src="http://img40.imageshack.us/img40/8066/nesdev2.png" alt="Image" />
<br />
<br />What do you guys think? Should I go on and finish this? Or does anyone who can model actual 3D want to give it a try?
<br />
<br />EDIT: BTW, would the address "nesdev.com" redirect to the new page or would the address change?

<br />
<br />So just the nesdev name would be enough.
<br />
<br />As for the wiki one, I just took the original, fixed a few fuzzy pixel and added it.  That was a quick hack just to make it obvious that it was related with the original NesDev site.  For the current prototype page, Durda dan converted the original logo with a transparent background without adjusting the fuzzy pixel so if you check the page, you would have an idea what I did for the wiki logo to make it better.
<br />
<br />I will try your logo to see how it comes out when I scale it down. It's a prototype page after all.

The page almost look like the original but I would like to be able to apply other style on specific element on that page only.  I still need to do more research since I don't want all the wiki to be affected but just the pages for the nesdev site.
<br />
<br />edit:
<br />
<br />Basically I'm trying to "emulate" the style. I know, bad pun.. Too tired I guess!

<br />
<br />I guess it may be OK to tweak it, but I feel that an easily recognizable part of it should remain, be it the color scheme, the font, whatever, but the old logo should live on.

<br />No, I hate it too.  Doesn't look like anything even REMOTELY NES related.  I realize there's probably trademark issues abounding WRT using specific iconography but yeesh...put SOME creativity into it.
<br />
<br />I am one to talk, though...I haven't put much creativity into my own logo or icon.   <img src="./images/smilies/icon_redface.gif" alt=":oops:" title="Embarassed" />

<br />
<br />The second one make less sense once the site will be on the wiki since the address wont be parodius anymore but <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://wiki.nesdev.com/w/index.php/Nesdev">http://wiki.nesdev.com/w/index.php/Nesdev</a><!-- m --> .
<br />
<br />Later I can update the wiki logo with this one too if it get approved and I think it should.
<br />
<br />As for the style of the page, I tried to do some CSS testing with the same color of the original page but for now Cheesemeister didn't agree with it and removed it.  So my question is: should the page in the wiki still look like the original one for color (background, font etc) or it should definitively move to the wiki color style?
