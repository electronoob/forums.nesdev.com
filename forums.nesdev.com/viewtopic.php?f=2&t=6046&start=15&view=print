<br />
<br />In my opinion, it's really not worthwhile to put so much effort into completely encrypting your prototypes to make them unleakable, because that'll just make things hurt more when they do get leaked and cracked. See also: Megaman Vengeance.
<br />
<br />That's one of the things that bugs me about programmers in general; the whole "MINE!" mindset they tend to have. It's really no benefit to anybody, and it only serves to damage one's own ego. This is just my opinion though.

Place in the beta cart a self-destruct mechanism that will destroy the rom chips should they somehow get in.  Like a small glass tube of acid that will break when the shell is split open.

Then seal the whole thing in some sealant that is sufficiently hard (so that any attempts to cut it would result in destroying the chips inside, or disconnecting the battery). Also, run the battery wires around like a cage, so any attempts to cut into the package would disconnect the battery.
<br />
<br />Then plug this bad boy into a regular NES, and ship it.

<br />What kind of reward were you looking for? I'm not saying "hand your rom out for free", I'm saying "focus more on your game, rather than how to protect the prototypes from being leaked".
<br />
<br />Megaman Vengeance got leaked, and the project was ultimately cancelled because of it, meaning all of the effort was wasted on what ultimately were egos. Despite the prototype being readily available, it's only the first stage. Do you know how many people *still* say "man, I would've loved to see this get finished" despite this leaked prototype being available?
<br />
<br />Even if free content was leaked, if there's the promise of more, the interest will remain. It's why people are interested in buying Battle Kid, despite the free demo being available.

<br />There are multiple parties whom would have reason to take legal action - tepples and the publisher off hand, but there could be others depending on the contract.
<br />
<br />There is no 100% way to prevent leaks - look at all the high-profile movies that get leaked due to people working at DVD pressing plants. I would suggest a multi-pronged approach:
<br />
<br />1) Make testing builds identifiable. This way, you know where the leak came from
<br />2) Make the publisher responsible for beta testing. That way, the onus is on them to investigate and prosecute any leaker for copyright infringement (and nowadays, infringement is much more serious for unreleased media than released)
<br />3) Make it such that the due diligence you do to make the prototypes traceable insulates you from any negative results. If you do your damndest and the thing still gets leaked, you are not responsible and the publisher should not be able to pull out.
<br />
<br />This may be easier said than done. I recommend you stress upon the publisher that despite the best efforts of multimillion dollar corporations, media still gets leaked, and due to economies of scale this is even harder for you to do as a lone developer.
<br />
<br />This whole situation reminds me of CBS threatening to withhold ALL high-definition programming if the FCC did not implement a broadcast flag to allow them to prevent broadcasts from being recorded in the first place. The broadcast flag was shot down and yet CBS is still producing countless hours of HD material. Piracy is a known and unavoidable risk, and any publisher who wishes to make the developer responsible for mitigating the effects of piracy has not been properly advised by their legal department.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Hmm, I think if you distribute a ROM over the internet, it's going to be really really hard to prevent a leak. When you have access to a soft copy of the data, it can be easily duplicated and manipulated. So if you're looking for more security, go with a hardware test, I'd say.
<br />
<br />Someone mentioned something where the cart stopped working as soon as you opened it. I think that kind of thing would work. But you'd want it so that the person can't remove the PRG or CHR chips without destroying them. For example, you could have the pins be extremely fragile towards the top, where you could easily break a pin off if you moved it. Or if you know what you're doing, do the whole glob-top thing. Though I don't know anything about that. Perhaps there's some sort of plastic you mold over the cart board so that you really just can't get the chips out?
<br />
<br />But then you have to still make sure you can't get at the data with a CopyNES or something like that. If you can think of a way to fool the CopyNES, then you might be good to go. I'm probably overlooking a million other possible ways to dump data onto a computer though. I think I have a weird, but possible idea though. Modify a NES to send to beta testers that has your game locked in it. Your game's PRG will actually be on a battery packed RAM chip. If the tester tries to remove the cartridge, or unscrew the motherboard to make it into a CopyNES and dump your game (or basically tamper with the stuff in any way), the battery would be removed from the chip somehow. Then all the data would be lost. Hmm... Maybe a dumb idea.
<br />
<br />Another option, and probably the safest, but most impractical one, is to physically meet with a beta tester, and have a single copy of the game that you take with you after they're done testing. That way, you know that there's only one copy, and that it's safe with you. If you're set on giving people a soft copy though, I would recommend just leaving stuff out of the test that you don't access. I don't really know what to say otherwise...

<br />I would physically meet with beta testers, but I don't know enough gamers in Fort Wayne, Indiana, who would be interested. The only one I know has shown an interest in leaking things before. But I do have some power over him: he can't play Super NES games on a Super NES without something I own.

I'm then going to put their IP address, broken up and transposed, in specific places in the ROM, the location of which will be impossible to find. I'm also going to watermark the manual (PDF).
<br />
<br />It won't stop anyone distributing the ROM but it should hopefully encourage a basic level of integrity and enable me to name and shame anyone who does spread the ROM (if I find out!).
<br />
<br />Trying to stop the spread of the ROM is only because there are features/bugs that I don't want spreading out to a wider audience. Hence the whole idea of a Beta test period - it will hopefully reduce the number of issues that people will have with the proper release and subsequently mean I won't have to spend quite so much time addressing problems from multiple sources.
<br />
<br />It does bother me though that someone could actually make carts from the ROM and sell them. I'm not going to be charging for the ROM myself but there are plenty of unscrupulous people out there that might try.

<br />True, and they commonly come on this board in hardware second and "kindly" ask for advice and does that many times a week. (okay they calmed down recently but...)
