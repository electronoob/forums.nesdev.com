<br />
<br />
<br />i finally build my first few rpgs using the 29f032.
<br />
<br />Now i tried building a tales of phantasia but i only get a black screen.
<br />
<br />i splitted the rom into a 4mbit and 2mbit file. 
<br />i don't have to expand the 2mbit file right?
<br />
<br />i put the 2 chips onto the ff6 board, but i only get a black screen.
<br />
<br />do i have to alter something on the board?

<br />i meant a 4mb and 2mb file
<br />
<br />32mbit and 16mbit 
<br />
<br />of course without header.
<br />
<br />
<br />i think my donorboard might be broken... dont know... soldering looks almost perfect.
<br />
<br />
<br />i dont wanna buy a repro, i want to build them by myself, thats where the fun lies <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />

<br />
<br />Since you have two ROMs you'll want to make sure that the appropriate ROM is enabled based on what is trying to be read from the 36pin maskrom socket. If your PCB has more than one socket and you did not modify the board it is no wonder it isn't working.But you'd have to be more detailed with what you did. Pictures also are helpful if you want someone to try to diagnose your problem.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Hey again,
<br />
<br />Ok i will try to be as specific as i can.
<br />The idea was to bring a translated tales of phantasia onto a japanese Final Fantasy 6 board via 2 Tsops. This should work, since the FF6 Board has 2 36Pin Slots (second Mask Rom was only using 32pins though). 
<br />
<br />- i removed the header of the japanese top
<br />- patched top with the translation patch
<br />- splitted the 48mbit file into 2 Files 4.194.304 Bytes and 2.097.152 Bytes
<br />- i did not expand the second rom to fit 32mbit, just left it at 2.097.152 Bytes
<br />- burned the files as i always do, mounted them onto the adapter and onto the pcb
<br />
<br />I checked all lines and i cant find an error. 
<br />the A Lines all trace back to the right places as far as i can tell. 
<br />
<br />Here i have the pictures of my work: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://s1070.photobucket.com/albums/u482/Foskel/">http://s1070.photobucket.com/albums/u482/Foskel/</a><!-- m -->
<br />
<br />What part of the board should i modify to get this to work?
<br />
<br />Anyone used a ff6 pcb for a similar project?
<br />
<br />And one last thing: thanks!!

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Your problem is FF6 is a 3 megabyte game. The PCB board has decoding logic that expects one of those sockets to have a 2 megabyte ROM and the second to have a 1 megabyte ROM.
<br />
<br />You need to rewire the decoding for ROM enable signals so that your Flash chips will be enabled at the right times. Right now it's wrong. Your soldering and chip programming may be perfect. But it will never work until you rewire the ROM decoding. 
<br />
<br />The MAD-1 chip controls when it enables the ROM from Socket 1 or Socket 2. It does this based on address lines. So you probably need to disconnect certain inputs into the MAD-1 and connect different signals to it so that the ROMs are enabled properly. 
<br />
<br />I do not have details but if you have electronics knowledge and pinouts for the MAD-1, SNES cart port, SNES MaskROM, you should be able to trace signals and figure it out.

<br />i soldered the 2 tsops out and tryed it with a chrono trigger tsop, still black screen. 
<br />
<br />strange board O_o

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Chrono Trigger won't work either because again, the MAD-1 controls ROM enable signals between the two slots. Chrono Trigger should work if you wire the /CE signal from the other socket together with the one Chrono Trigger's TSOP flash chip is on. Try it. You're then basically bypassing the MAD-1's two different /CE signal generation then as you only have 1 rom chip anyway. 
<br />
<br />But for ToP, you'll need to configure the MAD-1 appropriately for the mapping it needs which I don't have any details on that.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Well that's good. As I said, if a board has 2 ROM sockets, you need to understand how/when/why they are enabled. Then modify it. Otherwise you need to replace them with identical sized ROMs or it just won't work. And if your game is a different size then you must modify it unless the game changed to is smaller than the original game.
