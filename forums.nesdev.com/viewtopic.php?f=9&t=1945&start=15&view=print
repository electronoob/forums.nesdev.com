Have you verified that the power adaptor works at all? If so, then see if it's getting to the power jack and trace that to the regulator.

<br />
<br />To check the power jack I'd just look and see if it's looks like it's soldered properly, hasn't came loose or something.  That's probably the most likely point of failure.

I tested at what I think is the power jack (very small area, not able to see from the top, tested on bottom of board) and it didn't even register 1 volt.  I know the multimeter is working just fine.  Any suggestions now?  Replace power jack?  Let me know guys and thanks for the input.

I confirmed the multimeter is working properly by testing it on other devices, batteries, etc.  I am getting a .22v on the input of the regulator and 0 on the output (testing middle/ground and the input and output of the voltage regulator)  Still not sure what's going on.  Is it possible to connect a different power supply direct to the votage regulator to test if the system will power up?  Can another power source connect direct the input of the regulator?

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />You're not trying to use a NES power supply are you? One reason for the .22V may be because it's not a DC supply! Put the meter in AC mode and see if that makes a difference. Also are you sure you have the thing on the correct range setting?
<br />
<br />If it is a DC supply, measure the voltage with your meter. You can directly attach a regulator to the supply but depending on the regulator and supply, the ripple may be too much for the Famicom. (You may need the capacitors.)

I'm really thinking about wiring a battery supply to the famicom similar to what they did in many portable nes projects just to deliver power to the regulator to get the 5v to power the system.  I will give that a shot tomorrow.  If anyone else has anything, give me a shout.  Thanks guys.

If that is a fuse, i'm guessing it's bad....am I on the right track?  Thanks.
