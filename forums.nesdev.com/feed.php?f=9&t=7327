Yeah, I wouldn't bother with EPROMs, there's no need to use such an old technology if you can avoid it.  Brand new 512kB flash chips should be around $2 each.<br /><br />Even better is an EPROM emulator, but that may be $100-$200, I'm not sure.<br /><br />Theoretically there might be a cheaper flash-only programmer, or at the very least with stuff like the Willem, you can power it off USB since it only needs 5V.  I kinda doubt there is a super-cheap USB Flash chip programmer around.  Since adding USB almost requires adding other stuff like an MCU to it (or writing OS drivers for more direct control) compared to simpler parallel-port programmers.<br /><br />Using RS232-&gt;USB adapters should be safe, if something in RS232 flavor turns up.<br /><br />I checked the grinder used on my gamebit BTW, it was a grinding wheel.  Maybe I could do yours if you can't get it with the sandpaper.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=10">Memblers</a> — Tue Jan 04, 2011 4:48 pm</p><hr />

Thanks for the hints and offers.<br /><br />However, I don't need 72-pin connectors.  Someone else posted a few months ago looking for them (I forget who).  I found them while looking for the gamebit driver, so I posted.<br /><br />I'll try to grind down my bit this weekend.  The bit has a hexagonal "driver" end, that I can lock into my power drill's chuck.  I'll use another drill to spin a circular sanding disk, and press the disk against the main bit try to evenly wear down the outside.  If I screw it up, I'm only out about $7.00.  With the luck that I've having this week, this will be the least of my problems. <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" alt=":(" title="Sad" /><p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3664">clueless</a> — Tue Jan 04, 2011 2:17 pm</p><hr />

You can also get the gamebit in microdriver size if you shop around. You used to be able to find dedicated gamebit screwdrivers as well, once upon a time. I haven't seen them in years though.<br /><br />As to the connectors, if you just want straight 72-pin connectors, I think I can order those. I need a source (manufacturer in China) for the ZIF slots so I can get them in bulk at an affordable rate.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=4070">Xious</a> — Tue Jan 04, 2011 2:05 pm</p><hr />

I'm sure you can order a 60-pin connector from Digikey and elsewhere with the standard 2.54mm pitch.  I'm not sure about the board thickness they're made to accept (datasheet should say), or the board thickness of Famicom carts.<br /><br />The 72-pin NES connectors are 2.5mm pitch, which is very non-standard.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=10">Memblers</a> — Sun Jan 02, 2011 8:41 am</p><hr />
