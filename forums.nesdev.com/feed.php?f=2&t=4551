Well I'm pretty sure that if the few fighting games on the NES failed it's because the developpers didn't have the idea (or the guts) to make one of them BG and the other one sprites. As long as the BG color is proprely chosen, it's possible with CHR-ROM to make whathever fighter looks right to be BG, and whathever fighter that looks left sprites using the same BG tiles flipped horizontally, allowing them to use a decent amount of space.<br /><br />The poll is a close call, and anyway that "Big vs small" things have no point when it's possible to do them any possible size, there isn't only 2 sizes allowed.<br /><br />To allow enough detail it would be really nice to have them seriously larger than the big mario of SMB 3, slightly less than twice that size, making them 7x4 tiles wide "standard", different when doing attacks. That's smaller than SF2, and bigger than most platform games.<br /><br />That way the biggest size fighter would be about 7x4 tiles of sprites (that's 16 8x16 sprites or 28 8x8 sprites, both are acceptable), plus up to 2 tile wide of a second layer to allow for more colors (as bananmos said) for the face which needs more detail/colors and is relatively small as opposed to the body which is large and needs typically less colors.<br /><br />The other fighter is 7x4 tiles of BG, and it's second face layer would still be sprites (obviously), which makes a great total of 8 sprites (exactly !) on the head line, and 4 on the others lines, allowing for smashes without even too much flickering, and even if you see 2 hears layers, 1 body layer and one smash and there is like 10 sprites for a few frames, with correct cycling this won't look weird at all !<br /><br />The worst case is probably if both players are grounded at once : There would be 7 sprites for the body of the grounded sprites, plus 4 for the head layers, which would flicker a bit, but it'd be rare that both are grounded at once anyway.<br /><br />Of course, not all fighter should be the same size, nor should them all be square shaped sprietes ! My specs would be for the biggest 2m giant of the game (Zanghief, Abobo, ..., what fighting game doesn't have one ?), other people should be always smaller and thinier than him.<br />If anyone feels like doing their fighter smaller, by all means do it (as long as it's not 16x16 or something), but keep in mind that it will actually look like smaller.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=38">Bregalad</a> — Mon Aug 24, 2009 8:56 am</p><hr />

I'm thinking about 16x32 to 24x32 pixels, bursting up to 32x32 or 24x48 or so for special attack animations. (This size leaves room for two players and a couple projectiles with no flicker.) Try using sprite sheets from <em>Contra</em> or <em>Super Mario Bros. 3</em> as your templates.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=9">tepples</a> — Sun Aug 23, 2009 5:19 pm</p><hr />

The size of characters in Street Fighter II-style fighting games would make them flicker-fests if implemented on the NES with its 25% overdraw limit, unless perhaps you would make the background behind the characters blank. That's what happened to <em>TMNT Tournament Fighters</em> and <em>Kart Fighter</em>. They'd also take more space in CHR for a given number of frames of animation. That's why I've long recommended the smaller fighters as seen in the platform-fighter hybrid <em>Smash Bros.</em> series (and in the forgettable <em>Shaq-Fu</em>).<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=9">tepples</a> — Sun Aug 23, 2009 11:07 am</p><hr />

I like nes games but I always found this platform the worst for fighting one.  1 on 1 fighting as never been it's strongest point. But if you're talking about a beat-em-up a la double dragon, in that case it would be interesting.<br /><br />The nes shine more for platformers and the like. For fighting, I don't think so. Maybe that's why the interest vanished so fast.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3559">Banshaku</a> — Sun Aug 23, 2009 5:10 am</p><hr />

Sorry to dig this one, but.... is somebody still motivated to do a colaborative fighting game ?<br /><br />I like programming so I'd probably do the programming part if there would be someone who tells me what to do. Once we agree with graphics standard, everyone could work on character's sprites and arenas, while I (and possibly someone else) would do the programming of the game engine with only one character.<br /><br />Is it beacause so many people disagreed about the size of the sprites and amount of layers that the project didn't start ?<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=38">Bregalad</a> — Sat Aug 22, 2009 12:52 pm</p><hr />

True. Sadly I don't know anything about making web pages. I'd suggest creating a new thread for the Game Maker version, and later another thread for the assembly port. So maybe those threads would be for updates and we could keep disscussing the posibilities on this one.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3544">egfelixdcg</a> — Mon Mar 30, 2009 10:24 am</p><hr />

This is a great start, really. But now it should be structurated arround a website or something serious about the project.<br /><br />On the programming side... allow crouching and kicks would be great, but so far it's really good.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=38">Bregalad</a> — Sun Mar 29, 2009 1:58 am</p><hr />
