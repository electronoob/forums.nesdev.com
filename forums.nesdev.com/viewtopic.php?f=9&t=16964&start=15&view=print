Another idea is to simply mirror it at $8000, and make sure I don't allow any addresses into the DMC registers that overlap RAM being used by my program code.<br /><br />The former idea gives me a simpler memory model, while the latter frees up a little bit extra RAM for this purpose. (Yet another idea would be to add a second SRAM chip, but that would require a lot more signal routing.)

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I originally thought the DMC start address could be set so I could wrap around and begin at $8000. But upon double-checking, it seems that's not the case. Thanks for making me double-check.<br />That being said, I can still mirror my SRAM to $C000-$DFFF and hopefully be okay. My VGM player code is going to have to remap DMC memory blocks anyway, since I can't place them on top of my program ROM, so I'm prepared to deal with that.<br /><br />I hadn't considered using a 32KB SRAM (or some other size), and splitting it across areas of the memory map, but its also not a bad idea. If done right, it might even make the address decoding glue simpler than mirroring the 8KB SRAM.<br /><br />I'm definitely going to sketch out all these ideas before I go ahead and make the &quot;Rev B&quot; design changes to my board.  Until then, I guess I just can't play the SMB3 soundtrack. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":-P" title="Razz" />
