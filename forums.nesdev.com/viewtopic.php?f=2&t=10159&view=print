		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />i have an NES project where the mirroring is vertical, but I just realized the mirroring on my desired cartridge is horizontal. I looked over my documents but couldn't find info on this topic.<br />Basically what I'd like to know is if my project could keep it's vertical mirroring despite the above fact or if I have to tune and set up my code to handle horizontal mirroring before making a hard copy?<br /><br />Thanks for keeping these boards alive everyone! <img src="./images/smilies/Mfr_icon_homebrew.png" alt=":beer:" title="Beer" />

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Whether nametable mirroring is hardwired depends on the cart type (mapper). On NROM, UxROM etc the mirroring is hardwired, on AxROM, MMC1, MMC3 it's mapper controllable.<br /><br />That said, you can rewire the cart to switch to vertical mirroring, see <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://nesdev.com/rom.txt">http://nesdev.com/rom.txt</a><!-- m --> for details. CIRAM A10 is the key.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Carts that don't have mappers with mirroring control can be soldered in different ways to use different types of mirroring (it's also possible to override the mapper and permanently set the mirroring). So yes, mirroring is hardwired in the sense that the software can't change the mirroring type as it runs (unless a mapper allows this), but the person making the cart can, using a soldering iron.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Tokumaru is right that discrete boards will usually have solder pads to select horizontal or vertical mirroring, though boards manufactured by Nintendo use the opposite nomenclature compared to the emulation community. Bridge the H pads to select horizontal arrangement (same as vertical mirroring), or bridge the V pads to select vertical arrangement (same as horizontal mirroring).<br /><br />Say you were to put Lawn Mower (mapper 0, 16 KiB PRG, 8 KiB CHR, vertical mirroring) on an Ice Climber board (NROM-128, horizontal mirroring). You'd open it up and see a pair of pads bridged with solder, marked V. You'd desolder that pad and solder the H pad for horizontal arrangement.

I wonder why they even bothered.  It only really saves you from a single mapper write at game start up.  Doesn't look like any boards even used them anyways aside from the default mapper controlled jumper.  Probably one of those 'brilliant ideas' that came from a manager that didn't have any real thought behind it and it wasn't in anyone's position to question it. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" />

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I wonder if they based TEROM/TFROM off an earlier PCB (one with solder pads for mirroring), and just didn't care about removing the now-unnecessary solder pads. I mean, they're literally just two traces and a pad for each, I doubt they were hurting on resources from that. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" />

If this person had bothered to do some quick hardware research (i.e. just open a cart!) before coming up with this...

If you are it makes good sense. What doesn't is when you hear the term &quot;Four Screen Mirroring&quot;. Four Screen is actually the lack of any mirroring at all. So usually you should just drop mirroring and just say Four Screen.
