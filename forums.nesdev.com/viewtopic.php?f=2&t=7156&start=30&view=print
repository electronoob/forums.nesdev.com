Plus it's simple, but the 8 bit mode was just an idea, well it wouldn't be an MMC1 anymore, but just MMC1 compatible I guess. It's be nice so even if homebrewers don't use it, people can still use it to make MMC1 repro's with it? <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />
<br />
<br />
<br />And thats interesting....Yeah I am going to use CHR-RAM for ease of use of animation, and compression might be bad since I am using the 32x32 tiles 2 per pokemon front back as I said before, but finding the pokemon tiles in ROM would be very difficult for high numbers as it'd have to run the numbers all the way up to until it hits that tile, so I think I'll pass on that. And also, sounds for each pokemon possibly, too, so it will take up some space if so and I am going to add those in if this gets done. I just want to make sure I have that space and have no worries.
<br />
<br />
<br />These are all ideas, even the pokemon game, but I am going to put serious time into it when I get to.

You don't have to compress the whole thing as a single block, that'd be stupid. You can compress each individual 32x32 square, so you have direct access to them.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">I just want to make sure I have that space and have no worries.</div>
<br />I still think 1MB is a pretty high estimate, and since there are no boards available for ROMs that large you are just getting yourself in trouble. Why don't you start with 512KB and if that turns out to not be enough you can expand it to 1MB and convince emulator authors and cart makers to support your game.

If you have a whole bunch of data blocks of different length, you use some sort of directory to reach them all. For 256 different gamecocks each with a front and back image, we have 512 different 16-bit start addresses, or 1024 bytes. I can think of ways to pack the directory tighter if need be, such as sharing the high-order byte among several in a row.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">And also, sounds for each pokemon possibly, too</div>
<br />Say the distinctive cry of a gamecock species can be expressed as a stream of (pitch, volume) commands for two channels and lasts roughly a second. Then say each cry can be encoded as "frames", each consisting of two pitches, two volumes, and a length in vblanks. This would take 4 bytes, and on average there might be 20 frames in a cry. So 4 * 20 * 256 = 20 KiB for cries.
<br />
<br />But one unown factor remains in this business plan: Where do you plan to find artists to draw your 256 gamecocks, plus their trainers?

<br />
<br />He starts out with a simple pixel-based RLE compression and progressively makes it more complex and more efficient. But the techniques he uses are very clear and the whole thing is easy to follow. By the end he reaches a very impressive compression ratio (he compresses the image down to, like, 55% of it's original size).
<br />
<br />One of the reasons the scheme worked so well was because the image was compressed as a whole, instead of being divided into individual tiles. So if you are up to the task you could implement something like that for your game. If you are not, even some generic tile/data compression is better than nothing.

But this is a CPLD, which is reprogrammable, and it would be easy enough for me to supply different versions that cut out some of the features, so that others can be improved. Just depends what a project calls for.  It's nothing like an ASIC, which is set in stone (er, silicon).  The config I'm writing makes every function of it usable, but it is a little bit on the hacky side in this mode.

<br />If a bit hard to carry along with my laptop when I get an itch to code on the bus. And I'm still waiting for blargg to finish that MMC1 cart supporting in-circuit flash programming, which would make it as easy as using GBA multiboot as opposed to finding someone to solder together a CopyNES.

<br />True. But the Codemasters one only made predictions based on the pixel to the left, while this one also uses the one from above. Also, while Codemasters was apparently interested in encoding colors more likely to follow in less bits, this codec appears to replace colors with their frequencies given the context, in an attempt to group similar frequencies and generate longer RLE runs. Pretty clever.
<br />
<br />EDIT: Another very interesting thing I learned from this article was the auto-trigger RLE. When you work with low-color images that use only 1 or 2 bits per pixel, traditional ways of defining the repeat count would be very wasteful, so I really liked the idea of checking for runs only if the same pixel is used twice in a row.

<br />Could a MMC1 (Or any other extended serial mapper) be made compatible and extend it into 8 bit mode too for ease of use with bigger ROM images with the 5 writes to register, any more sets to 8-bit mode kinda thing?

<br />
<br />I don't think there are any other serial mappers like MMC1. You could make your own MMC1-like mapper that uses 8bit shift register instead of 5bit I suppose. But it wouldn't be compatible with MMC1. You could probably make it like you suggested to have some sort of 8bit mode unlock, but that's silly. 
<br />
<br />If you want to develop a game to use a MMC1 but 8bits type thing an emulator could easily be adjusted to do this, but you'd need someone to program a CPLD for you if you wanted to make carts. 
<br />
<br />With MMC1 as-is, if you use CHR-RAM, you can change the wiring so that CHR-RAM is not bankable, just static 8Kb block. Then you can take the 5bit CHR register to control the PRG-ROM lines, allowing for something like 4 or 8 megabytes. It would function like MMC1 boards that have 512kb though. The upper 5 bits would be switching 256kb sections. So you'd have to duplicate code/data or something with that setup. It'd be easier if you could select any 16KB section from the total ROM but the way MMC1 works what I described would be the best you would get. Still, something like 4 or 8 megabytes if my math is right is a ton of ROM space. 
<br />
<br />Just to mention it one more time, there is no reason to do a 8bit MMC1. What I suggested would work with the real thing (I think) and if that's not enough features for you, make a new mapper or use a better one, don't alter the operation of the MMC1 as that's pointless.

<br />It'd be possible to take it to 8 MiB, but then you could use only 4 KiB of the CHR RAM. But then even SNES and GBC games rarely exceeded 4 MiB.

If you use the 8kb switching mode, CHRA12 will simply pass through, and the latched value will be ignored.
<br />
<br />I agree that there is no point in expanding the MMC1 by adding more bits, and that wasn't the point of my original post. There is however points in expanding it to support more RAM/ROM at least with iNES 2.0 additional flags. As long as the thing is possible with a real MMC1 by altering a real MMC1 board.
<br />
<br />EDIT : I am reading that article about compression right now and it's fairly interesting. I think information about compression methods is definitely lacking on NESdev... maybe I/we should work on that ?

<br />To me it seems like people here are afraid of compression or something... Rarely does anyone use anything beyond simple LZ or RLE. And a lot of people seem to think that you need lots of RAM in order to use compression, which is not true, since there are many ways to perform decompression "on the fly".
<br />
<br />Maybe we could "wikify" the compression schemes we have personally researched, and also offer downloads of the compressors and decompressors we have coded. I have C encoders (with poor error handling, as they are supposed to "do the job" rather than babysit the user) and 6502 decoders for that slightly modified Codemasters codec and for my own byte-oriented LZ scheme. If anyone wants to use those I can dig up the most recent versions.

<br />Personally I made a RLE-like compression for maps in my game, and that's about all. It is fairly good, and allows me to compress it "by hand" (without a tool). However maybe something better could be made up.
<br />
<br />I also investigated the huffman algorithm and made an encoder native to the NES but it REALLY sucks, I should port it to C or Java and re-realase it so it's effectively usable by people (including me haha).
