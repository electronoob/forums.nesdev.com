Heck, they cost that much (if not more) fifteen to twenty years ago, so that's not a hefty price in today's money.

<br />Do you know if the guy is in the USA? If so, there are a variety of ways to go after him and his bank account balance is irrelevant. You can get a judgment and garnishee his wages.
<br />
<br />To do this, you file a lawsuit for breech of contract in your own state and send a legal summons to the infringing party. If they fail to appear, you get a default judgment against them and file for transferal of judgment in the state in which they reside, giving them legal notice of the filing at the same time. If they don’t contest the filing, you get a garnishee and any wages they make from that point on (along with their bank balances and possibly properties, depending on the value of the judgment) go to you.
<br />
<br />International suits are far more complicated, although the proceedure works in much the same way, and I suggest limiting your testers to the US to simplify legal concerns.

<br />
<br />Let me give you an example. This disc was sent out as a review build to a professional magazine (one of the big ones). I bought it off of ebay for $20. Here's a picture of the warning on the disc: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://picasaweb.google.com/h4ckur/PhonePics#5341484521141451842">http://picasaweb.google.com/h4ckur/Phon ... 1141451842</a><!-- m -->
<br />
<br />The reviewer was under a heavy handed NDA, they risked not only their job but their career and the reputation of the magazine over $20 on ebay. There have been hundreds of these discs sold like that too. Best part is, Sony and Microsoft refuse to go after the reviewers.

The NOACs are generally very inexpensive and accurate enough for some things, and there is no worry about CopyNES with a NOAC. If your beta tester can't mail you back a whole unit (IE, he hacked the chips out) you'll know who your leaker is.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Agreed with arfink.  Also, you may consider ways to subtly degrade the play experience rather than crashing outright if the game detects it's running in an emulator/unauthorized reproduction--here's an article about ways this was done for a Spyro game:
<br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.gamecareerguide.com/features/20011017/dodd_01.htm">http://www.gamecareerguide.com/features ... odd_01.htm</a><!-- m -->
<br />
<br />Earthbound also makes attempts to discover if its crc has been changed and adds lots of extra enemies/makes the final bossfight unwinnable if it has.  Keep in mind you don't have to have foolproof copy protection, it just needs to last a few months after your actual release really.
<br />
<br />Also, consider your audience.  If they're the type to buy a physical NES game, I'd say it's pretty likely they don't care whether a rom exists or not.  Your publisher may disagree, however.

<br />This. I guess I'll have to get further in actually completing a publishable game before I discuss best practices for beta and release candidate testing with a publisher.

I have no idea what your game is, but I think simple things that personalize the object make it much more valuable to the customer.  Part of what you're selling is participation in the scene so play to it and add in something cool like a booklet documenting your design process or a printout of parts of your source code.  The other thing you're selling is the object itself, so you might consider doing a a limited run of your carts and numbering them, or add in an instruction manual + map, something to make it more of an <strong>object</strong>.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I was thinking about this topic and i wanted to make a few suggestions. 
<br />if you were worried of someone making a dump of the rom you could try to emu the game in a web browser using some java emulator.  that way the person would not have access to the original copy  and at worst would have a script that's useless for reproducing to live carts.
<br />With this you could give each person a way to sign up for the beta and have them create their OWN username and password
<br />If they use their own password they have more incentive to keep it more secret as it may be the same password they use for  say  email because we all know a lot of people like using the same passwords.
<br />
<br />Another idea is to incorporate some kind of lock and key technology into the game.  I have 2 approaches to this
<br />
<br />If you could create a random number generator in the game that would act as a lock and a website that you type that number into in order to generate a key.
<br />User types in the key and the game is unlocked.
<br />
<br />Random number generating might be too complex and stressful for the cpu so a watered down version of this would be to make a set number of locks in the game.  Say 100 or 200 random locks that you personally made.  Find a random password generator on the web and then create all these numbers.  then using the same generator create keys for each one.  So when the game starts it prompts with a random lock you made  and you type that lock on the website (which uses their user name and password) it gives you the key.  the chances of the same lock being prompted twice would be slim as its randomly picked so if someone gave out the cart and a key the person would have to power cycle the cart probably 200 times in order to get the same lock to populate.  this makes the attempt to play laughable.
<br />
<br />Of course there are drawbacks to this if someone was skilled enough they could just delete the code and the game would be playable.  but if you add a crc check to the rom...
<br />
<br />Another drawback is save states   just save the state with an old lock on the screen and use the old key they were holding on to.  but then the person would have to have 3 different things to play the game. The rom  the save state  and the pass key.
<br />
<br />one way or another if you created the code for this lock and key method you could sell the code for extras revenue for others to use this method of protecting games.
<br />
<br />If this exact method is not reasonable I say be creative with the concept.  You can make it as complex or lax as you want.

<br />The CRC check could be skipped just as easily. All protection that's built into the program and has no external components can be easily broken.

<br />You could program a largely inaccurate emulator that does some stuff the NES can't do, and tweak your game accordingly!
<br />
<br />Actually I think we already talked about that and how it's still pretty pointlessly convoluted lengths to go to.

<br />
<br />You could  but if someone were to burry the rom code into the emulator code itself it might prove difficult to extract cleanly.  I think there are a few java emulators that could be modified this way.  only down side is that they dont get to play it on real hardware or perhaps even with a proper controller.  
<br />
<br />But one thing people need to remember is that in the end any lock or protection can be broken.  The quality of the lock is just how much time you have.  I would pick a locking method that would be suffucant enough that could last untill the rom is into production stages.  Once the final carts are produced theres nothing stopping people form copying a real cart.
<br />
<br />A lock is also only as effective as the lock picker.  I would consider using any method that the user might be uneducated in.  if the user is uneducated in modifying a nes rom code to make the game start  then the easier lock is recomended.

<br />In fact, if you scroll back to the first page, the latter was part of my original plan: encrypt the compressed CHR data in each tester's copy of the ROM with a different key so that I can name and shame the leaker.
<br />
<br />UncleSporky mentioned making an inaccurate emulator and making the ROM rely on its specific inaccuracy. That'd be equivalent to making an emulator for a platform that isn't fully compatible with the NES and then making the ROM for that platform. That could work for some purposes but not for release-candidate testing.
<br />
<br />Or the people who actually put games on carts (such as Memblers and bunnyboy) could post their ideas of best practices and end the whole discussion right there.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />This is the solution I had come up with a while back.  I didn't think it would be terribly useful, but it was fun to think about.  It could work on Squeedo, or anywhere else there is a read-protected PIC (theoretically, the boot block on the PIC I'll use could be read/write protected to prevent "bricking").
<br />
<br />What you would do, is make your game program more dependent on jump tables.  Whenever you use the jump table, you write your entry # to the PIC, and the protected code in there does something mysterious with your data, and returns the real jump table entry for the NES to use.  So who cares if anyone has the ROM of the game, good luck to whoever tries to recreate the program flow based on a jump table, heheh.
<br />
<br />I may put something like that in the next Squeedo revision (with other weird stuff hidden in the boot block).  All it would do though would be to stop a 'normal' game from working on an emulator or any non-Squeedo cart though.  I don't know how useful that would be, but I guess it could stop betas from leaking outside of the Squeedo-using crowd.  Of course in that case you could just as well use the features unique to the Squeedo board, and get nearly the same level of protection since I doubt it would ever be properly emulated.
<br />
<br />edit - oh forgot to mention, it turns out this method of protection is similar to the protection used in some pirate port carts, like Earthworm Jim.
