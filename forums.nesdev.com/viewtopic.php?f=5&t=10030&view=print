The Xbox and GameCube were the first machines I know of to have separate levels of firmware on separate chips. In these machines, the BIOS is a mask ROM on the CPU or GPU die, while the firmware is on a larger, slower flash chip and is decrypted into RAM by a program in the BIOS.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I'd thought on the meaning of the term BIOS, Basic Input Output System. Don't know about FDS BIOS, but I guess it is what it is, routines to access disk drive, i.e. basic input/output. For Playstation it is more than just this, it has Memory Card manager, CD player, etc.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Definitions, meh. Some systems with a cartridge slot directly from it. Most others with or without a cartridge slot have internal ROM that they boot from, which then hands control off to the game on the storage medium (loading it into memory if it's a non-cartridge medium).<br /><br />I'd use the term <em>firmware</em> to refer to the ROM, since it indicates that it's <em>firmly</em> in memory even when power is removed, unlike things in (non-battery-backed-up, tepples) RAM.<br /><br />If once the game is running it makes further use of the ROM, it'd probably be called a BIOS. The benefit (and curse) is that it can be updated even after the game has been fixed on the storage medium.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Specifically in the case of computers and video game consoles: I'd say they're the same thing.<br /><br />In spinning hard drives, the firmware isn't very firm: it's often stored on disk, in a section you can't address from the host. I guess you might still call it a BIOS, though.<br /><br />In generic microcontrollers, the firmware isn't a BIOS.

There is a very small, 512 byte block of code that is part of the MCP-X (southbridge) (because MS thought no one would figure that out), but other than that the xbox's BIOS is all on the TSOP flash. (Except for the last revision of xbox, which used some kind of mask ROM). This does get expanded and copied to RAM, which is a separate level I suppose, but at this point it is a kernel.<br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://hackspot.net/XboxBlog/?p=1">http://hackspot.net/XboxBlog/?p=1</a><!-- m -->
