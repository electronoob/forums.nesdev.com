		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />If the actual ROM is 32K, then an accurate ROM dump should also be 32K (I don't care if Cowering calls it an overdump or not).
<br />
<br />My personal opinion is that CHR bits 4 and 5 probably don't need emulation, because no game using those diodes will ever intentionally cause a bus conflict (unless the developers were really dumb).  An emulator that was in the business of bus conflict simulation would also need to emulate bus conflicts with most discrete logic boards when writing to PRG space.  And I'm not about to suggest adding a bit to the INES header spec that says "Emulate bus conflicts."  Unless a bus conflict is predictable in nature (as is the case with that one odd Color Dreams mapper variant), there isn't really anything to gain by adding bus conflicts.
<br />
<br />Proper emulation of the CHR disable feature, on the other hand, is a necessity.  Nestopia currently uses an alternate-state approach, where the CHR is enabled after every other write to $8000-FFFF.  This obviously isn't hardware accurate.
<br />
<br />Have you ever seen a 16K CNROM game that uses D1 instead of D0 for CHR bankswitching?  If such a game exists, it cannot be mapper 3 (nor 185) because the bankswitching algorithm will be different from a standard 8K CHR switch.  A 16K CNROM game with D1 as a disable line should be assigned mapper 185, once that mapper has proper emulation (which will require the NES 2.0 sub-mapper field).

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Maybe 16 KB CNROM games just used additional CE because the ROM manufacturer did offer such CHRROMs, and they were compatible with 32 KB ones ?
<br />I'd ask why no game has ever intentionally disabled the CHRROM while rendering the screen in order to get black portions on the screen, this would allow it to disable the screen while it's still enabled trough $2001, for example to have a black bar without affecting the scrolling counters inside the PPU (battletoads does a similar thing, however it switches to a blank nametable, I wonder what would be the result if the CHRROM would be disabled that way).
