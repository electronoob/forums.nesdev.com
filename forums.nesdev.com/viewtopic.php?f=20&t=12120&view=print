(I've also done a teardown of the same unit.) Solder a wire to one side of the clock crystal and brush the other side of the wire against ground. This corrupts PC and/or other registers. Do this before the boot ROM shuts itself off and catch execution of the CPU, and you can access the ROM and dump it. <br /><br />The interesting part is that the boot ROM checks for another logo apart from the Nintendo logo, but only half of that logo is present in the boot ROM. (The same is true for the Nintendo logo, it only checks half the logo.) It may say RIS or KIS or maybe K13 or R13. The bottom half of the logo is shown here. (Half the Nintendo logo is also visible because I just copied the half over the logo section of a ROM to be able to convert it to an image. It would of course never appear as it does in the image, in real life.) If anyone has a clue what the logo might be, it might give clues about who made this clone.<br /><br /><img src="http://blog.gg8.se/images/nintendologo-wtf.bmp" alt="Image" /><br /><br />The boot ROM is also attached to this post, and you can read my disassembly below.<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">&nbsp;

This caused problems in Prehistorik Man and an artificial test ROM, only so far. Likely because the added circuitry triggers on the positive edge of the pixel clock instead instead of the negative or vice versa. I would expect the data coming out of the CPU to be identical to that coming out of a DMG, and that the mess-up happens later, but that remains to be confirmed.<br /><br />And no, DMG parts don't fit. The reason is that the distance to the PCB is a few mm longer than on a DMG, and so are the buttons and the guides for the buttons. DMG buttons would otherwise fit if the case was modded, but I don't want to do destroy a unique piece like this. Maybe I should try to hunt down another one, and completely redesign the internals of one of them. :p
