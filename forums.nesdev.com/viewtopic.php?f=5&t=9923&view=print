Are the emulators using a color palette from software or hardware? would there even be a difference?<br />the emulator FCE Ultra GX lets you select multiple palettes so obviously its software driven.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I'm told the Wii piracy community has tools to inject an iNES format ROM into the Virtual Console NES emulator. I haven't tried it, but if it's anything like the emulator in Animal Crossing for GameCube, there will be audio problems. The electrocution sound in Balloon Fight is much more boring (muffled, no detune) in AC's emulator.

I understand why many would think that the companies that made the consoles know more about it than everyone else, but in reality their emulators are often worse than the best ones made by the community. Most problems are sound related, but video issues are not that rare either.<br /><br />I'm sure Nintendo can't handle the NES palette any better than the emulators we use. A lot of things affect how colors look on the NES, and each TV interprets the signal differently, so there simply isn't a magical set of RGB values that can be considered &quot;correct&quot; representations of the NES' colors.

The correct palette is the set of RGB values that, when run through the Wii's video encoder chip and decoded on a TV at given settings, produces the same colors that the NES would produce through the same TV at the same settings.

They probably want a clean &quot;RGB&quot; look for example. They also probably know that those interested in accuracy either still play the NES, or play emulators, and that it wouldn't be worth the resources to try to win over a small portion of these people. These emulators are a small part of a much larger picture to them. I think they could make very accurate emulators, but it would be extremely costly.
