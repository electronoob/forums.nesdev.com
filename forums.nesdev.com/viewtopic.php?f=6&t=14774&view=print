		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Hello, <br /><br />Just wondering if anyone here is using MML (Music Maco Language) for creating their NES(nsf) music instead of using a tracker like famitracker or perhaps a modern daw?<br /><br />As a programmer myself, the idea of being able to create music through codes while staying in the comfort of my favorite editor is something that's very enticing. <br /><br />Aside from the obvious differences in workflow and the representation of music notes (which one can perhaps get used to overtime) what are some of the things that you liked or didn't like about MML compared to trackers? What would you say are the advantages(strength) and disadvantages(weakness) of MML? Which area does it excel in? or did it ends up being overly tedious and un-intuitive for you?<br />----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />I searched a bit online, but there doesn't seem to be an over abundance of material on MML comapred to its counter part: famitracker, which, of course has a strong following in the community and a few fantastic and detailed youtube tutorials. However, for MML, these two seems to be the only available sources right? <br /><br />Learning Materials:<br />1. <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.nullsleep.com/treasure/mck_guide/">http://www.nullsleep.com/treasure/mck_guide/</a><!-- m --><br />2. <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://woolyss.com/chipmusic/chipmusic-mml/ppmck_guide.php">http://woolyss.com/chipmusic/chipmusic- ... _guide.php</a><!-- m --><br />* <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://wikiwiki.jp/mck/?MML">http://wikiwiki.jp/mck/?MML</a><!-- m -->  (now this one is very well made and contains a wealth of information, but sadly it's in Japanese so it's a bit hard to utilize even with google translate)<br /><br />Does anyone know of any other materials by any chance?<br />------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />Now, when it comes to setting up MML, the primary steps seems to be:<br /><br />1. Obtaining VirtuaNSF„ÄÅ NSFplay<br />2. Get ppmck. 09a being the latest pack I believe?<br />    -unzip and extra the files and use them to set up the enviornment<br /><br />That's pretty much it right? (are there any utilities that are essentials when it comes to mml, ppmck? hoot?  syntax color scheme, analyzer? )<br />----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />*<span style="color: #FF0000"><strong>Lastly, all of these packages and software seems to be made for Windows, does anyone know if it's possible to set it all up in Linux? ^_^ If so, could someone perhaps show me how? Thanks in advance!</strong></span>*<br /><br /><br />By the way, I know a lot of the nes game's music were composed with MML in the past, but when it comes to modern chiptunes, what are some of the composers or musicians I can check out who use MML as their weapon of choice when it comes to music creation?

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I could never really get into trackers so I'm more for MML. I'm no musician but I can read sheet music, and MML is basically like writing sheet music but with symbols easily typed on a PC keyboard rather than stripes and tadpoles.<br /><br />One problem with MML is that there is no Famitone for it. PPMCK is feature-rich but it seems to be mainly for making NSFs rather than homebrew development, and also you are restricted to NESASM. NSDL seems good but with that you are restricted to CC65/CA65.<br /><br />In the end I decided it was a good idea to learn how to make my own sound engine, and it was very worthwhile. It shouldn't be too hard to make an MML interpreter for it.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />It is true ppMCK is meant for making .NSF and is not meant to make a game. But I think ppMCK can be compile on Linux it is a C code and is probably portable, although I have not tried it yet (try going into that directory and typing <tt style="margin-left: 2px; margin-right: 2px; padding:3px; background-color: #3355aa; color: white;">make</tt> and see if it compiles without errors). I have made some improvement of ppMCK, but have not tried it since I have this new computer (with Linux). I do not use syntax colours.<br /><br />It is possible that many people will not want to use ca65 and will prefer ASM6; or in my case, I prefer NESASM.<br /><br />I have also once made a music engine for a Famicom game and used Csound and CsoundMML, but that don't work so well. There is AmigaMML to make music output to .MOD/.XM formats, but that isn't actually suitable for NES/Famicom anyways. (But, possibly a program can be based on modified version of such things, to do something else.)

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />MML is for music MACRO language, not micro, because it uses macro in order to register instrument sounds.<br /><br />I like MML better than trackers. It's more flexible and all, and is basically platform independant. You'd in theory just need to change macros and you'll be ready to play the same song on another platform. Also, if you want say a channel to echo another channel (play the same melody with a delay), with MML it's trivial, but with a tracker... welcome to hell.<br /><br />MML is also the sole format that allow you to compose with a different tempo for different tracks, or to have not all tracks looping at the same time. It also allow you to control more directly the memory of what's in the music replayer, much like programming in assembly.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Bregalad's points put Pently solidly in the MML camp.<br /><br />By using named instruments in Pently, I've left the multi-platform option open. The prospect of a port to Super NES is why I pushed for a 65C02-style SPC700 instruction macro pack in ca65, so that I could share song and pattern interpretation code between NES and Super NES versions. But you'd still have to change channel names in arrangements of a piece for different sound chips.<br /><br />A 2-channel echo in Pently looks like this:<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">at 9:1<br />play melody_a with flute on pulse2<br />at 9:1:3<br />play melody_a with quiet_flute on pulse1</div><br />This waits for measure 9 beat 1, starts a pattern on pulse channel 2, waits until 3 rows after the start of the beat, and starts the same pattern on pulse channel 1 with a different instrument.<br /><br />A 1-channel echo looks like this:<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">at 9:1<br />attack on pulse2<br />play fanfare_b with staccato_horn on attack<br />at 9:1:3<br />play fanfare_b with echo_horn on pulse2</div><br /><br />Independent looping per channel in Pently was inspired by the short drum track loops in the ground, Starman, and water themes of <em>Super Mario Bros.</em> And it saves a lot of space, which was important for the NROM-128 games for which I originally developed Pently. A loop can also be interrupted, which makes drum fills practical.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">Bregalad wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">MML is also the sole format that allow you to compose with a different tempo for different tracks</div><br />How can tracks be kept in sync like this?

This happens rarely, but if you want to do it, you can. With a tracker you can't.<br /><br />The most obvious use is to include sound effects such as birds tweet in a music, and you don't want your birds tweet exactly at the same place in music every loop for instance. Not useful on NES, but definitely useful on platform with more sound channels.
