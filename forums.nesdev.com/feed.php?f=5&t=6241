So it appears to be a Jekyll and Hyde situation; I can work with you on that. As long as the good John keeps posting interesting things related to NES development and the nudity-fan John keeps it subtle, I won't see much of a problem. The thing about Mega Man platforms was cute for an occasional laugh, but a page-lengthening post consisting of hundreds of repetitions of "Penus " wasn't. Nor was devoting an entire post to scrambling the letters in a quote to say "intercourse", but had it been about a racing game with an "outer course" and an "inner course", that might have drawn a chuckle. If Mr. Hyde wants to post about his PINGAS, there are always other forums for that; try the comments of <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bDQQg0qMWgs" class="postlink">any random YouTube Poop video</a>.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=9">tepples</a> — Sat Apr 03, 2010 9:49 am</p><hr />

I wouldn't call that funny, I'd call that disappointing.<br /><br />That said: I smirked at what you originally posted here, and I've had a chuckle at some of your previous postings as well.  I'm almost always in jest myself, online and in person.  "Old regulars" from IRC #nesdev can tell you how absolutely bonkers I can be.  My point here is: yes, I can take a joke, and I do find crude humour funny.<br /><br />The reason I made the video is because 1) you've a recurring theme when posting on this forum (seemingly trying to make people take the piss spouting off lies and general nonsense) and 2) some folks were starting to take your nonsense seriously.  There's a 3rd and 4th reason I suppose: I'd never heard of the Metroid Password Generator before + it'd been a while since I'd played Metroid.<br /><br />My point is: you don't have to be serious to hang out here, and your edited screen shot was funny (to me), but when someone calls your bluff don't act like an ass.  :-)<br /><br />And please don't start some preposterous debate (re: nudity vs. porn).  What some consider nudity others consider pornography, regardless of the Wikipedia or dictionary definition.  Ever heard the phrase "beauty is in the eye of the beholder?"  It applies here.  To me your screen shot edit isn't porn -- but some could be offended by it nonetheless.  Should you live your life by other people's rules?  No, but have a little bit of taste next time.  :-)<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3">koitsu</a> — Fri Apr 02, 2010 8:15 am</p><hr />

How does it matter her hair is red ?<br /><br />It seems from more recent pics they changed it to blond later. Altough hair-color swap was common back in the NES days, even in my game the heroine is blonde but her sprites have dithered red/skin color cause if I did sprite overlay to make her blond it would end up flickering too much (altough I might change my mind just before the release of the game, I'll have to try both ways).<br /><br />The most crazy is in the PS2 game Atelier Iris : Eternal Mana (one of my all time favourites). The hero has dark brown hair in the CG intro, light brown hair on the pictures, red hair on in-game close-ups of him and blond hair on his in-game sprites.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=38">Bregalad</a> — Fri Apr 02, 2010 4:02 am</p><hr />
