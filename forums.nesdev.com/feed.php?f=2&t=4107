Well, in order to do that you would have to move some entries around in the metatile graphics table.  For example, if you wanted to make the mushroom metatiles ($19-$1b) use palette 3 you would have to move them to the palette 3 section of the table.  I recommend placing them at the very end.<br /><br />Be careful though, to make sure the palette pointer offsets point to the correct position in the metatile graphics table, or you'll end up with screwed-up graphics and possibly odd block behavior.<br /><br />Also be aware that the metatile number itself is what governs the behavior of metatiles in the game.  Make sure that the upper limit for solid and climbing metatiles is updated, or things may not work just right.<br /><br />Oh, and because the metatile number of the metatiles that followed it will have changed due to bytes being moved, you'll have to take into account the fact that those numbers are used by other parts of the game...<br /><br />In other words, what you propose to do is definitely full of potential pitfalls.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=119">doppelganger</a> — Tue Aug 26, 2008 5:10 pm</p><hr />

I believe you own a source code that can be compiled and modified as you wish, right? Go to 3.<br />2. If you don't, so you must do it.<br />3. Did you find the "attribute engine"? There's no secret, as the PPU does the exact same "strategy", no matter the game.<br />4. If you know where's the "attribute engine", is this space enough? If the answer is NO, you need to change the mapper number into someone else that exists.<br />5. If you wrote about unable to change the attribute thing, so you're wrong. The game can work without an "attribute engine" (it's not an engine after all, that's the meaning of quotes).<br />6. Try to modify the thing and recompile it. Remember you need to find portions of data that's NOT program code, but tables... you know. ^_^;;<br /><br />- Other than that, there's not much. If you "can't" it's because you barely knows how the present attribute thing work.

Not all of his ideas are bad. I think it would be sweet to port the original SMB to the original GB. But that's a tall order as we all know. You'd have to have a very good understanding of both systems and spend alot of time rewriting alot of code. Maybe you're right that he enjoys coming up with grand ideas like these. It is fun to dream afterall. The problem comes when he wants others to realize them for him or under estimating just how tough something will be.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=1726">MottZilla</a> — Thu May 15, 2008 12:38 pm</p><hr />
