<br />
<br />I made a couple small programs including a small pong-like program, and the set-up for a tic-tac-toe program... but my biggest frustration is finding information on how to write text.
<br />
<br />Every place I've found briefly mentions something about $2006 or something, and putting sprites in the "right spot" in your chr file... but I searched the pages here and several places online including zophar's... and I just can't seem to find something that will help me display text on the screen.
<br />
<br />Now I most likely just missed something but I've been looking for about an hour and a half now for this info... and it is slightly frustrating. (Not blaming anyone, I'm mostly frustrated with myself!)
<br />
<br />Can anyone point me in the right direction? <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />
<br />
<br />Thanks.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Welcome to the NESdev community <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />.
<br />
<br />First of all, I'd just like to say that writing text isn't really a category in NES programming. You put stuff on the background, or you put sprites on the screen. Most of the time, however, writing text is done by placing tiles which hold the graphical data of alphabetical characters on the background.
<br />
<br />Do you know how to put a string of tiles on the screen? If you type this in your asm file:
<br />
<br />.db "HELLO"
<br />
<br />Your assembler should translate it to:
<br />
<br />.db $48,$45,$4C,$4C,$4F
<br />
<br />So if you know how to copy that string of tiles on screen, then there's one thing to do. Draw the alphabetical characters A-Z in the pattern table starting at $41, so tile $41 will contain the letter 'A', tile $42 will contain the letter 'B', etc. You should end with 'Z' on $5A.
<br />
<br />Sorry if I'm not making any sense. I'm assuming if you've made a pong clone or a tic-tac-toe setup, you know how to write to the background. If you don't, that's not a problem; I'd be happy to explain it. It's just late right now and I'd like to save a useless explanation if I can.
<br />
<br />EDIT: Okay, just quick, if that didn't help, try this:
<br />
<br />lda #$21
<br />sta $2006
<br />lda #$C9
<br />sta $2006
<br />
<br />lda #$48
<br />sta $2007
<br />lda #$45
<br />sta $2007
<br />lda #$4C
<br />sta $2007
<br />sta $2007
<br />lda #$4F
<br />sta $2007
<br />
<br />lda #$00
<br />sta $2005
<br />sta $2005
<br />
<br />Where in the pattern table, tile $48 contains the graphics for the letter 'H', in tile $45 the graphics for 'E', for $4C the graphics for 'L', and for $4F the graphics for 'O'. For testing purposes, I don't think that it's wise to try and draw an alphabet though. If you have something like YY-CHR you can totally rip off a font from almost any game.

<br />
<br />Now next, When I do this, I seem to get the same character no matter what I change .db "HELLO" to. I'm not looping it so I only expect to get the "H", but instead I just get this blob character no matter what I change the "H" to.
<br />
<br />If you'd like me to include some source, I'd be glad to <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />
<br />
<br />Thanks again for the big help. I've been doing hobby programming since .. around '92 in QBasic (Then went on to VB, C, FreeBasic, and all that HTML/CSS/PHP stuff), but this is the first language I've done where you learn graphics before text! Hah <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />
<br />
<br />As far as this goes though, I think if I looked at an example that simply includes the CHR file and the ASM file that displays "HELLO WORLD", I should be fine. 
<br />
<br />Thanks again <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />
<br />
<br />edit: I guess my main confusion is this: Is there a set place where you're SUPPOSED to put your text tiles? I'd assume since $48 is "H" that I can only place my "H" character in $48? Also, are there any tile editors that show the tile information of the tile your editing? I'll look a bit  more... but I was told Tile Edit, but honestly, while it does its job... I hate not having the information I need in each tile.

<br />
<br />Well, you've certainly been programming longer than I have. I started programming around 2005, but I've learned a lot since. I know some Qbasic, a little visual basic, I'm pretty far in learning C, I know 6502, I forgot all the HTML I ever learned pretty much (since it was so small), I know some Z80, and probably a little more of other stuff. I'm mainly focused now on learning C so I can make level building apps for my NES games.

<br />
<br />Also, the CHR file isn't set up so that tile $48 is 'H'. When you do .db 'H' it translates to .db $48. I think at tile $48 in that file, it's a blob of some sort. So in the CHR file, copy/paste numbers 0-9 to tiles $30-$39, and letters A-Z to $41-$58 (I think Z would be at $58, but copy it so A is at $41, B is at $42, etc.)

<br />I can get text to display if I enter in the correct tile number (#$48 )... but if I do "H", it still shows a blob.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />You're doing this:
<br />
<br />Hello:
<br /> .db "H"
<br />
<br />.org $8000
<br />
<br />With this statement, you are basically saying "place a value of $48 here". Then when you do:
<br />
<br />lda Hello
<br />
<br />it's loading a byte from an address. And since the address of the "Hello" label is outside of ROM, it's loading some garbage value. And also, keep in mind that it's loading a value from an address, like:
<br />
<br />lda $8020
<br />
<br />Where the value of $8020 is loaded into A. When you do:
<br />
<br />lda #$48
<br />
<br />you immediately load a value of $48 into A.
<br />
<br />In WLA-DX, I know you can use the .define statement like this:
<br />
<br />.define Hello "H"
<br />
<br />Though I think it's different with NESASM. There's one thing I'd try, and one thing I'm fairly sure will work.
<br />
<br />First, try putting a "#" in front of Hello in LDA Hello. Because maybe if .db is outside of ROM, NESASM sees this like WLA sees .define.
<br />
<br />Otherwise, and you'll want to do this if you load a string of text onto the screen, move this:
<br />
<br />Hello:
<br /> .db "H"
<br />
<br />to somewhere in ROM around where you keep the palette.
<br />
<br />Summary:
<br />So basically I'm pretty sure the problem is that it sees "Hello" as a label, and not just another name for the value $48. But I seem to remember using the .db statement to make names for variables outside of ROM. If this is the case, a simple lda #Hello should fix the problem. But if you're going to be making "Hello" a label from which to load a string, you need to move that into ROM. If you DO move that label to ROM even as is, it should work, but it will use a byte to hold the value $48 in ROM, and you will load using an address instead of an immediate value.
