The stickiness seems to have scrubbed away, and the boards have come back to life (has worked on 4 boards so far).<br /><br />So, that's good news. I'm glad you guys asked enough questions to get my interested enough to try this... hopefully I can recover the others too.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Wow, all 12 boards came back to life. This is great.<br /><br />So... my solution was just to give them a really heavy toothbrush scrubbing front and back with the same alcohol, then a brief rinse with water, a quick pat with a cloth and a dry in front of a fan.<br /><br />All of them work now after doing this. Very strange.<br /><br />A lot of sticky residue came off on my fingers while doing this. A lot of the boards felt sticky after I started scrubbing, but eventually they all seemed to come clean. Very odd; I don't know -what- exactly I'm washing off (it doesn't seem to me that rosin should be the cause... but I dunno), but I'm glad this worked.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I dunno, I had this problem on two occasions and in between I switched solder, so I would tend to discount that. My current solder is 0.8mm &quot;super solder wire: the best quality solder&quot; 60% stuff they sold at the local electronics shop. The previous solder was Nexxtech &quot;rosin core solder for PC work&quot;, also 60% but 1.2mm diameter. If I leave the board with rosin spatter on it, it doesn't look so nice, but the board works fine.<br /><br />Light scrubbing with 99% isopropyl alcohol messes up the board for me. Heavy prolonged scrubbing cleans it back up. The stickiness seems to come after light use of alcohol, even if I do it on a clean looking corner of the board, so I'm not really sure the rosin is even a factor here. Anyhow, more alcohol and more scrubbing take it away again so everything is fine now. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />I was actually only trying more alcohol because I wanted to verify that this was happening; so I was actually scrubbing a board really hard, trying to just see if I could wear away the solder mask entirely, and that's when I noticed the stickiness went away after a bit. Maybe there's some weird residue on top of the solder mask?<br /><br />If you guys hadn't asked a few questions I wouldn't have recovered these from the trash to try this! So, thanks everyone. This has saved me a fair bit of time and money.

I've found that after desoldering components from a board that I used this flux on it was best to thoroughly scrub the board with warm water and a bit of dish soap (the kind that says it cuts grease) using a tea towel. If I skipped this step I often wouldn't get proper adhesion with the next solder I applied.<br /><br />I never did scrub these with alcohol though, so I didn't get that creation of stickiness you describe. I tend to try dish soap first.<br /><br />Maybe the alcohol is chemically reacting with the stuff?<br /><br />I dunno, I'm not a chemist or an electrical engineer <img src="./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" />
