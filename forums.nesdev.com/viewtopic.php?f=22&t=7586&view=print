<br />I have tightened up the controls, redone several of the tiles, added zombies, AI, damage, player attacks and enemy deaths. Give it a try <img src="./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" />
<br />
<br />Also updated the screenshot.

<br />
<br /><strong> Original Post</strong>
<br />I'm back again with another demo! Yay! I really learned a *lot* from my <a href="http://nesdev.com/bbs/viewtopic.php?t=7555" class="postlink">attempt at a side-scrolling space shooter</a>. I have now started work on a side-scrolling platformer adventure / RPG type thingy (think Zelda II, Faxanadu).
<br />
<br />Don't look now Tokumaru, it's a flip-screen game <img src="./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" />
<br />
<br />The map tool chain and graphics content pipeline are just about complete. Object-to-background collision is implemented, as is jumping. Use the D-Pad to move, A to jump. When you hit the edge of the screen you will go to the next room.
<br />
<br />All graphics, tile definitions and everything else for each screen is loaded between screens (after the pallet fade), so there is a ton of flexibility in the engine graphically. The map itself is edited with a generic GUI application (<a href="http://www.mapeditor.org/" class="postlink">TilEd</a>) and a Python script builds the data ROM banks from that. The map is 32x32 screens (the size of the Metroid map) and will take about 128KB of ROM if half of the screens are used (which is higher than Metroid's ratio, I think). I am really excited about this project!
<br />
<br />I would really like some input on how the controls of the character feel, especially acceleration, deceleration and jumping. Note that the room layouts are not final or anything, just for testing.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />If you can, I suggest that you let scroll between (horizontally contiguous) screens that share the same tileset/palette (like Faxanadu). It would really add a lot to the game's sense of place/visual continuity. (If you're clever you could have flip-scrolling between areas with marginally different tilesets/palettes.)

<br />The character does have a nice inertial feel, but this is ruined by the fact you can turn around on a dime without the slightest bit of skidding.
<br />
<br />Also, you may want to consider not having ceilings affect the character's y-velocity (like Zelda 2 and Contra). This would make platform easier when ceilings get in the way. For instance, in that screenshot right there, jumping to that top platforming from the one two blocks lower is a bit annoying because of the ceiling.
<br />
<br />Also, silly complaint, but I noticed that when the character hits the bottom edge of the screen he starts standing on it:

<br />
<br />The only thing that can be annoying is that when jumping up, and when you miss the platform on the screen up, and you fall down again, there are much palettefading/black. But still it feels much better than in Battle Kid! Perhaps it's beacuse you added some gravity to the game. I have always had problem with BK and it's non-gravity gameplay.
<br />
<br />Yeah, and the graphics looks really nice (even though much of the backgrounds are Zelda II?). This could definitly be a cool game. Just add some music and sfx's, some cool enemies, cool weapons, and some really awesome bosses! Drooling!

<br />
<br />Thank you for the encouragement! That means a lot to me. I will need help with the music I am afraid. I am not much of a composer. I am using several games as reference on how to create the graphics. The bricks and columns were based on Zelda II, the windows and recessed areas were inspired by CV / CVIII, the player sprite was based on the main character from Battle of Olympus and Faxanadu.
<br />
<br />When I say "based on" I don't mean I ripped the patterns and modified them. I mean I studied the patterns in detail to see how they were structured, then created my own patterns using a similar structure.
<br />
<br />Except the columns, those are almost pixel-for-pixel. There's only so many ways you can arrange vertical stripes with a depth-of-field effect using three colors <img src="./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" />

<br />
<br />I feel that too, but right now it's a trade-off between how controllable the jump height is and how fast the initial jump is. I'll be tweaking on this a bit too, but not until next week.
<br />
<br />Thanks for the feedback! I really appreciate it!

<br />um.  Well, after much jumping and rethinking... he's jumping with a shield and sword... that's pretty good!  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />  But, while playing Link in Zelda... on one of the post-super-nintendos I was jumping just up and down in beat with the game, like you can in your's too  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /> , and i noticed that Link seemed to jump a tad bit higher when the jump was perfectly in sync with the game... and I thought COOL! HES GOT SOME MAGICALNESS IN HIS JUMPING WITH A SWORD AND SHIELD! And so your game gave the same impression, before i tried to judge if it was really happening.  It seemed not to happen.  Nintendo's games are awesome because there is a little part somewhere where a character impresses you!  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_eek.gif" alt=":shock:" title="Shocked" />   <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />

<br />
<br />and another: i want to make it clear that i think this effect is awesome. the colors are vibrating.

<br />The character movement is really well done already!
<br />I like how he jumps, but the acceleration is a little slow. It feels too much like Mario Bros. ^^
<br />Good thing, you don't slide around like the Italian plumber with his slippery rubber boots.
<br />Ok, back to topic, the movement is really neat! A little tweaking on the acceleration wouldn't hurt thought (my opinion).Jumping around really works nice! Stopping on small blocks to climb up inside the castle is no problem which is good.
<br />Also leaving the screen and landing safely on the new screen is easy to do which is another good point. However, this depends on your map design as well...
<br />Don't let the player jump into something deadly right when he leaves the screen in the final game.(I know, that sounds like common sense ^^')
<br />I know, you said the graphics and the design are not final, but I just wanted to say, that the outside world's tiles are really not that great. Inside the castle, it is not too bad, but everything looks the same.
<br />You'll need some changes in there (If you have enough memory left for more tiles), like broken rocks and maybe some different sizes of rocks or something. Also some ripped curtains always look good. Like in Castlevania ;3
<br />To me your demo looks a lot like a mixture of Zelda 2 and Castlevania and I like it ^^
<br />Keep it up!
