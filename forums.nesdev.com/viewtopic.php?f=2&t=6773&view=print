Now it's possible to view the original source code when debugging if the ROM has been assembled with CC65. I'm not sure how much I'm going to be working on this in the future so I'll just release it now. Here's a screenshot:<br /><br /><img src="http://thefox.aspekt.fi/nintendulatordx3.jpg" alt="Image" /><br /><br />This was a quick hack so there probably are some bugs in there. Even in its current state I think it's quite useful though.<br /><br /><strong>How to use</strong><br /><br />Pass the &quot;--dbgfile foo.nes.dbg&quot; switch to linker to generate the debug file. You'll also need to include the debug information in object files using the &quot;-g&quot; switch when assembling/compiling. The debug file has to have the same name as the iNES rom with &quot;.dbg&quot; extension added, for example &quot;foo.nes.dbg&quot;.<br /><br />NOTE! You need to use the latest snapshot version of CC65 because these features do not exist in the stable version.<br /><br />For now it only works with iNES roms! Also it will not work if the linker config outputs to more than one file.<br /><br /><strong>How to use the cycle counting timers</strong><br /><br />Write to $402x to start the timer and $403x to stop it (where x is the timer ID 0-15). $401E/$401F are aliases for $4020/$4030 (for VirtuaNES compatibility). Timer title can be specified with a symbol named &quot;__timerX_title&quot; which points to the zero padded timer title.<br /><br />Now, one important thing about the timers. If you do STA $4020 followed by STA $4030 it'll report 0 cycles, so the STA cycles don't count. But it also subtracts 4 cycles from all running counters when nested timers are used. For example:<br /><br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">; this code will report 0 cycles for both timers!<br />sta $4020<br />sta $4021<br />sta $4030<br />sta $4031</div><br /><br />Here are couple of macros for CA65:<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">.macro start_timer timer<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; sta $4020+timer<br />.endmacro<br /><br />.macro stop_timer timer<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; sta $4030+timer<br />.endmacro<br /><br />.macro timer_title timer, title<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; .ident(.sprintf(&quot;__timer%d_title&quot;, timer)):<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; .byte title, 0<br />.endmacro</div><br /><br /><strong>How to use debug output feature</strong><br /><br />This feature allows you to do &quot;printf&quot; style debugging from your applications. It works like this: when the emulator detects a write to $4040, it reads a string from PC+3 and outputs it in the debug window. This feature can thus be used from any assembler. Some simple number formatting is also supported.<br /><br />Some helper macros for CA65:<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">.macro debugOut str<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; .local over<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; sta $4040<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; jmp over<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; .byte str, 0<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; over:<br />.endmacro<br /><br />.define fHex8( addr ) 1, 0, &lt;(addr), &gt;(addr)<br />.define fDec8( addr ) 1, 1, &lt;(addr), &gt;(addr)<br />.define fHex16( addr ) 1, 2, &lt;(addr), &gt;(addr)<br />.define fDec16( addr ) 1, 3, &lt;(addr), &gt;(addr)<br /></div><br /><br />Some usage examples:<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">.zeropage<br />&nbsp; some_var:&nbsp; &nbsp; .res 2<br />&nbsp; other_var:&nbsp; &nbsp;.res 1<br /><br />.code<br />entry:<br />&nbsp; lda #$34<br />&nbsp; sta some_var<br />&nbsp; lda #$12<br />&nbsp; sta some_var+1<br />&nbsp; debugOut {&quot;entry point reached, some_var = &quot;, fHex16{some_var}, &quot;, isn't that exciting?&quot;}<br /><br />&nbsp; lda #123<br />&nbsp; sta other_var<br />&nbsp; debugOut {&quot;other var is &quot;, fDec8{other_var}, &quot; in decimal&quot;}<br /></div><br /><br />Here's a helper macro for C language:<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">#define DEBUG_OUT( str )&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; \<br />do {&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; \<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; ( ( void __fastcall__ ( * )( void ) )&quot;\x8D\x40\x40\x60\xEA\xEA&quot; str )();&nbsp; &nbsp; \<br />} while ( 0 )<br /></div><br /><br />Using it is simple: (NOTE! The parameter has to be a string literal.)<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">DEBUG_OUT( &quot;Testing NintendulatorDX debug output from CC65!&quot; );<br /></div><br /><br />Unfortunately it's not possible to output the values of variables from C code at this time.<br /><br /><strong>How to use the .proc/.scope profiling feature</strong><br /><br />This feature allows you to find out how many cycles each .proc/.scope is taking in your program. It works by keeping count of number of cycles taken by each value of the PC register, and writes out the results in a file named &quot;&lt;romname&gt;.nes.profiling.txt&quot; when the ROM is unloaded.<br /><br />Write to $4041 to start collecting profiling data, and $4042 to stop. You don't have to write to $4042 if you want the data collecting to end when the ROM is unloaded. If you simply want to collect data for the entire run of the program, write to $4041 somewhere in your reset routine.<br /><br />Currently the feature does NOT support banking, so if you use banked ROMs with it you will get erroneous results.<br /><br />The results are something like this:<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">&#91;module general.o&#93;: 4328012 (91.6 %)<br />&nbsp; init: 89352 (2.06 %)<br />&nbsp; detectSystem: 60556 (1.4 %)<br />&nbsp; initVariables: 44 (0.00102 %)<br />&nbsp; reset: 2771377 (64 %)<br />&nbsp; setPalette: 24 (0.000555 %)<br />&nbsp; updateControllerState: 4903 (0.113 %)<br />&nbsp; nmi: 1401756 (32.4 %)<br />&nbsp; irq: 0 (0 %)<br /></div><br /><br />This tells us that 91.6% of processing time was spent in the module general.o, and out of those 4328012 cycles 1.4% was spent in the routine detectSystem, and so on. In other words, the percentages on the higher levels are always relative to the parent.<br /><br /><strong>Downloads</strong><br /><br />Emulator + mappers (Unicode, Win2K/XP/Vista/7): <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://kkfos.aspekt.fi/downloads/nintendulatordx-0.33.zip">http://kkfos.aspekt.fi/downloads/ninten ... x-0.33.zip</a><!-- m --><br />I have included a compatible version of the CC65 snapshot in the above package.<br /><br />That should be all for now.<br /><br />EDIT: Now supports bankswitching, updated download links.<br />EDIT: Added the screenshot as an image instead of link<br />EDIT 2011-01-05: Added some features, updated link to v0.20.<br />EDIT 2011-02-04: Added a note below CC65 snapshot link<br />EDIT 2011-02-26: Pulled latest version of Nintendulator from SourceForge SVN and applied the updates, the new version includes timer support, download link updated<br />EDIT 2011-03-27: Updated to version 0.26, shows init and play cycles for NSF, some bugs fixed<br />EDIT 2011-07-06: Version 0.27<br />EDIT 2011-08-03: Version 0.28.

<br />...
<br />
<br />Anyways I've added a variable watch feature to this thingaling now. Screenshot:
<br />
<br /><img src="http://thefox.aspekt.fi/nintendulatordx.jpg" alt="Image" />
<br />
<br />Still needs some work:
<br />1) reading from memory
<br />2) modifiers for the input string, something like "velocity,word" would instruct it that "velocity" is a pointer to a 16-bit value, or even more complex expression parsing
<br />
<br />Downloads will come later. Probably.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I worked a little bit on this again. Now the watch list can retrieve and display values from memory. Data size can also be specified (byte/word), e.g. "foo,w" adds a watch on symbol "foo" which points to a 16-bit word. "foo,b" and "foo" are equivalent. Should probably add support for 32-bit and fixed point variables in the future.
<br />
<br />Expression parser would be nice.. so you could do stuff like "sprites+20" or "$123+55,w".
<br />
<br />EDIT: Forgot to mention, it's also possible to double click on the source listing to set a breakpoint.
<br />
<br />Known bugs:
<br />- watch list is not cleared when a new ROM is loaded (need to restart Nintendulator)

<br />Download link for v0.20 is in the first post.

<br />I agree, that kind of feature would be very nice. Actually it's not the first time that the topic has been brought up in here. But it's a lot of work for (relatively) little gain in functionality.

What I meant in the first post was that you can't have separate output files like "header.bin" and "code.bin" which are concatenated later. Output must be directly to iNES ROM (code assumes that segment output offsets include the 16 byte header.. this is needed for bankswitching calculations).<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">Sorry for all the questions: I really like the prospect of this but I really don't have the time to be distracted by it if it's not going to work with my project.
