		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />If you were to tell me a few years ago that there would be emulators that played 99% of NES and Famicom games perfectly, I would have been non-committal.  That was in the days of Nesticle, where maybe half the games ran correctly, if at all.  Today we have Nestopia and Nintendulator, two emulators that are incredibly close to emulation perfection.  But Mapper 118, used for Famicom titles Ys III: Wanders from Ys, RPG Jinsei Game and Armadillo, still displays noticeable graphical glitch, namely the subscreens for each game regularly shake.  I have been told that Mapper 118 is a subset of MMC3, a thouroughly documented mapper.  What is the issue?  Is there still some obsscure timing issue inside the NES or a lack of knowledge about the cartridge hardware?

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Well, I have a question for you. Are you writing your own emulator? If not then don't worry if Nestopia/Nintendulator can't run these mappers correctly. Let their respective authors deal with that. If so, then 118 is another fine example of a poorly documented mapper which, in reality, doesn't need our time nor patience.

<br />Maybe there are just other higher-priority things to work on first. Think priority =  severity * number of games affected. If it's just the subscreen and you don't access it much, maybe it's been ignored. I think the authors of those emulators would be the best people to contact.

<br />Perhaps subscreens was the wrong word.  The status bar is more appropriate and you see it constantly.  Its like Kirby's Adventure on a poor emulator, the lower part of the screen always shook.  While it only may affect three games, it is one of the few visiual inaccuracies left to tackle in the NES Emulation of commercial games.

<br />More like priority = severity * number of games affected * popularity of affected games.
<br />
<br />But wasn't Wanderers from Ys (pronounced "ease") ported to Super NES?
