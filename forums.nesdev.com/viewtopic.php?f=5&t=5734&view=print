<br />No, we're obviously lying and are all part of the sinister RetroZone conspiracy to rob customers.

<br />Anyways,  I and 2 others I know bought from Retrozone with no problems at all and I think the PowerPaks are awesome products. I hope to see more from Retrozone!

<br />
<br />After checking the IP, it appears to be through an ISP in France.  Assuming it shipped, maybe it's lost, or someone in customs decided to keep it (officially, or by stealing it).  That sucks though.
<br />
<br />mumbly: Try contacting your local customs office.  It's worth a shot..

<br />
<br />Thank you for your replies and interest related to RetroZone. It's better to do that via forum and IRC than sending email to RetroZone because it would be like throwing a bottle in the ocean. 
<br />I'm located in France and I think that a quality of service is the key to satisfy the customers.
<br />
<br />The proff of my issue : 
<br />ORDER #714 that I did 6 months ago ! I'm used to order in USA !!!!
<br />
<br />First, they send me the wrong product.
<br />
<br />Next, they ask me to send back the wrong product in USA by paying the shipping cost twice (one time for the order, one time to send back the product in USA). Of course, I did that.
<br />
<br />After, I received back the package with the wrong product because they gave me a WRONG ADDRESS ! I've paid EUR 13,- more to get this wrong product back to me ... Grrrrr !
<br />
<br />Since 4th August, I've send all pictures, all shipping cost, emails, ... and asking for a refund ! I've never get any answers. They keep my money and kick my ass ! 
<br />
<br />How this shop can sell with a so nasty service !

<br />You never responded why the package was returned, if it made it to the USA, or if you were going to send it again.  At least it shows international shipping isn't 100% guaranteed from anywhere...

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />For shipping stuff to Europe, I don't bother with standard USPS.  I actually spend the extra money to go with Express Mail International, or I go with Global Express Guaranteed.
<br />
<br />The reason is that 1) the packages come with tracking numbers (internationally), 2) make it through customs quicker, 3) are handed off to local postal services once they arrive in the country of destination.
<br />
<br />I ship stuff to Canada, Sweden, Norway, South Africa, and Japan fairly often (Scandinavia is the most common), and it's the only way I'll do international shipments.

I think it's worth it even though the cost of shipping certainly goes up to pay for express tracked and insured delivery particularly for any idea over a certain amount such as the PowerPAK. I'm sure RetroZone could do that for international buyers if they were willing to pay for the better shipping option.

<br />LOL !!!! I warned you in July 2009 and please check your email inbox from August 4th and you will read my answer with attached pictures !!! Do you want me to post that on this forum and also others discussion forum to prove how you consider myself and your customers ?
<br />I'm fade up with your false comments, and it's not fair what you have done to me and probably you do to other people.
<br />
<br />I WILL NEVER STOP ANNOYING YOU.  EVERYBODY HAS TO KNOW THAT YOU ARE NOT PROFESSIONAL AND YOU STEAL HONEST PEOPLE !
