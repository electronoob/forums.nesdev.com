		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />It depends on whether you're asking about the code I write at work or the code I write for personal projects.
<br />
<br />At work I mainly use Java, and sometimes C/C++. There's practically no code optimization taking place there, because almost none of the stuff we write is speed-critical, and maintainability and stability are <strong>much</strong> more important than execution speed in our line of work.
<br />Design and maintenance usually outweigh the implementation time if you look at the entire life-span of a piece of software.
<br />
<br />When I work on my own projects it's almost the complete opposite. I barely ever design anything before writing it, and I can spend hours trying to optimize away a few bytes or cycles in a piece of code. I still fix bugs, but I tend to do very little testing.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I think I spend an almost even amount of time designing and programming. I have developed a habit of always writing in a fair amount of detail in a text file about what I am developing. I do this at work and for personal projects. I did this out of necessity as I was very lazy for very many years, and couldn't keep my thoughts straight. When I was a kid I just let ideas/code fly out and this resulted almost always in hitting brick walls with my projects. Now I take it a bit slower. The irony is I think I get more done now, and better.
<br />
<br />I can't say I've spent that much time at optimization; but I'm sure this will change in the future as the requirements of my projects become more demanding.
<br />
<br />I think I spend a certain amount of time refactoring code as well. Sometimes I'll reach a point where I realize something is organized pretty badly with regards to maintainability/ease of use and I will spend a good amount of time brainstorming about a better way to organize it, and then take the time to re-organize it that way. Usually this pays off!
