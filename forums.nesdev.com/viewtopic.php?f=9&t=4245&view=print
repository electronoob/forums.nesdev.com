		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Simple question I think. If you set EXRAM to mode 2 where the CPU can read and write to it from $5C00 to $5FFF, can you copy code there and execute it? 
<br />
<br />I'm trying to do this but Nestopia and Nintendulator seem to say I can't do that. When the CPU try to execute at $5C00 range it seems to get all FFs. However when I copy my routine there, and then read it back I can see in the debugger that each byte was written correctly to EXRAM. To be clear, I copy each byte to EXRAM, then I just loaded each byte from EXRAM back into Reg-A and so through the debugger I could see it was written correctly. But the CPU when watched in the debugger will jump to $5C00 and read FF through the whole region.
<br />
<br />So can the CPU for some reason not execute from EXRAM? The reason I'm doing this is I wanted to avoid using PRG-RAM so I could use the MMC-5 board without any. 
<br />
<br />I hope someone knows the answer to this or can do their own test.

If you try it on Nestopia or Nintendulator it should crash (the NES program) though. 
<br />
<br />I agree with you, I think this is the emulator at fault as I don't see why EXRAM shouldn't be able to hold code. But the real hardware will have to be tested unless someone else has already tried this.

That and I don't know why they are broken.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />There's no reason I can think of why EXRAM cannot be used for code execution.  The fact that Nestopia fails is likely due to optimizations designed at fetching instructions as quickly as possible.  Those optimizations may not account for the possibility of special memory such as EXRAM.  Nintendulator might have a similar problem - don't know what kinds of optimizations that emu uses.
<br />
<br />If I get around to it, I will get the latest Nestopia source and see what I can find.

<br />It depends on the settings you choose. There's a mode that behaves like that, yes, but you can also make it behave just like regular RAM.

<br />You write to it directly via the CPU, instead of using 2006/2007 like when you're trying to access the internal PPU ram. However, we don't actually understand the MMC5 very well at all to know how exactly this is able to work. The MMC5 <em>must</em> do something to allow simultaneous accesses to the ExRAM though, since Nintendo made the decision to only allow writes (in mode 0 and mode 1) during rendering, which is when the PPU is constantly fetching bytes, meaning the MMC5 would need to also be constantly accessing its ExRAM.
<br />
<br />My hypothesis is that there's a pipeline, much like the read-pipeline in the PPU when you read 2007. When you write to ExRAM, the MMC5 stores it in the pipeline until the PPU is in between ExRAM accesses, during which it commits the write the CPU made. There are 3 PPU cycles for each CPU cycle, and when the PPU is fetching BG tiles, it spends two of its cycles fetching the bitmap data from the pattern table, so the MMC5 probably commits ExRAM writes during this time. There's a LOT of time in between sequential CPU accesses in which the MMC5 can commit writes, so this would work out flawlessly. This is just a hypothesis though, so don't take this to heart. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" />
