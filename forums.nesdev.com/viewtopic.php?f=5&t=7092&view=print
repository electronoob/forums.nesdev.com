<br />
<br />2) Realise how rarely you actually need 32-bit arithmetics.  Some programmers use 32-bit math for everything, and I don't see the advantage.

<br />Apparently, if you're overlapping a bunch of sprites, your code has to move each sprite around. If your script engine is horribly inefficient at interpreting the code to lay out sprites, you have to prerender each weapon on top of each frame of animation of the character.

<br />And you have to lay multiple sprites over each other? Why can't you just group all the sprites together and just increment the X/Y/Z coordinates? Why would it be too hard just to do that? Besides the fact some sprites may have others overlapping, but that could be solved with 1 more variables per sprite....hmm...

<br />If your game engine's script interpreter is a slow POS,* then the mere act of adding the hand's position to the body's X/Y/Z coordinate to produce the weapon's X/Y/Z coordinate and drawing a weapon sprite slows the game down. The impression I get from the article is "Game Maker sucks; something else probably fits your needs better."

<br />Not always. Maybe some materials to teach modern Visual Basic depend on a knowledge of C++/CLI or C#, but not everything does. My cousin learned a BASIC dialect from <em>Beginning Programming for Dummies</em>, and it didn't assume knowledge of any other programming language. At that point, he knew what a variable was, what a loop was, and what . Then he learned some C with the help of <em>C for Dummies</em> and <em>The C Programming Language</em>. He was onto 6502 assembly before having finished middle school.
<br />
<br />The <a href="http://docs.python.org/tutorial/" class="postlink">Python tutorial</a> doesn't assume knowledge of other programming languages either.

<br />
<br />I found PC development pretty intimidating too for a long time, but now that I've gotten comfortable with C, I've found it easy to start by using a library such as <a href="http://www.lazyfoo.net/SDL_tutorials/index.php" class="postlink">SDL</a>.  For my synth I got immediate (not necessarily correct, but..) results for my audio, graphics, and input.  But yeah it's a lot more work not having the benefit of any kind of 2D graphics hardware.  So you pretty much 'emulating' your own graphics system into a huge bitmap.  And no 'soundchip', so your audio routines need to be as fast as possible (for an action game or similar).  But just knowing how doesn't mean I want to do it, heheh, NES/SNES is much easier to get into to.
<br />
<br />LOL at the article.  Summary "Game Maker is slow at running games, so spend a bunch of time working needlessly on minor optimizations (to your artwork, even)".  Something like that is basic enough to be automated (if the compiler was smart).  And makes so many things impractical because of all the different combinations.

MS-DOS compatibility (before I switched to NT) and 2. all the convenience functions. But since then, Allegro doesn't appear to be maintained as closely as SDL; look at the broken Allegro packages in Ubuntu 9.04, 9.10, and 10.04 that don't work with PulseAudio. (SDL is in "main", the part of Ubuntu that Canonical engineers are paid to oversee; Allegro is in "universe", the community-maintained part.) There were also problems with getting Allegro to compile in XCode 3.2 around this time last year due to lack of QuickDraw headers.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">But yeah it's a lot more work not having the benefit of any kind of 2D graphics hardware.

<br />Speed for a sound engine isn't as strict as it used to be in the days of i486SX and MS-DOS. I'm in the middle of writing a replacement for SDL_mixer that 1. adds pitch control as a standard feature (as in Allegro) and 2. makes it easier to use synthesizers, decompressors, and other audio sources other than wave files (as in Allegro), though it gives up a little bit of speed for playing wave files because the wave reader is implemented as a synth.

<br />
<br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"> Watch out for slowdown when programming an SNES game or scrolling demo.  The SNES has a very slow cpu and it will slowdown very easily if you don't know how to optimize code.<br /><br />To optimize your code, always use less than 4 sprites.  Using more will take to long for the slow cpu to process.  Stick to 16x16 sprites.  32x32 sprites take 4 times as much cpu power to process.<br /><br />Avoid using too many layers of parallax, and hardware effects like transparency and Mode-7.  Transparancy and Mode-7 take a lot of processing work.<br /><br />Also don't try to move backgrounds too fast.  Remember the Snes does not have the blastprocessing feature the Sega Genesis has, so it can't make the backgrounds scroll on autopilot like the Sega Genesis can, so it takes a lot of cpu power to move the background.</div>

<br />
<br />Yeah, and in case you want to know (We own basically all of Williams arcade boards and a defender cabinet) the game Defender uses 48K of RAM that the video out is used for, and the VSync resets it to the begining and a counter ust increments an address, and inside the 48K, There X bytes one the screen, X bytes for RAM, X bytes for Screen and X bytes for RAM. So if you ever see the left side of the screen with stuff on it, it's the stack, they put it on the screen and adjusted it off from the factory. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" /> Pretty bad for a programmer and their crew to work around, but Jarvis and Demar did a good job, and am amazing job on Stargate! <img src="./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" /> I love my Defender <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />
