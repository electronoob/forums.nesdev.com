It's not that I dislike the documentation, I just like the actual programming more (who doesn't?). On top of that, the stuff we have to document and the way of documenting isn't exactly in my view of &quot;exciting&quot;, and even my teachers tend to agree. If I had to document the process of creating and optimizing an emulator, I'd be thrilled to, because at least this stuff is interesting. Heck, maybe one day when I'm actually good at this, I'll have some free time on my hands and I'll do it voluntarily (for some reason I have yet to figure out). <br /><br />By the way, is the majority of people here more of a hobby programmer, or do most people do it for a living?

But I have traveled the path you are traveling.  The key to reading PCB designs or datasheets is to know what it is you need to get out of the thing.  I don't know any engineer [besides the author, perhaps] that knows everything about any particular device because they read the datasheet from front to back.  Rather, you use datasheets as a reference...getting a pinout diagram when you need it for board bring-up testing...getting a register description or two when you need it for driver development...getting signalling characteristics when you need it for scoping/debugging...getting contact information when you need it for FAE support...etc.  Similarly with PCB design...you don't need to digest the whole thing at once [unless you're the author or an initial reviewer].  Every project I work on I deal with devices individually as much as I can and usually those devices are constrained to one or two pages of the schematic and a few off-page connections to other devices.  I don't worry about irrelevant pages of the schematic until I need to.  But I do insist that the HW designer provide me with all relevant datasheets for the board...to save the headaches of using the wrong document.  They always have the datasheets handy because they had to get them to do the PCB design...so it always works out.

To be honest, I was never interested in the low-level aspects of a computer, but I was always fascinated by emulators (playing GBA and NDS games on them with my little brother when those were a luxury to us), so when I started understanding how emulators work, I became eager to learn more. Now I wish to be able to read that stuff and be like &quot;oh, now I understand why this piece of hardware does that!&quot;. I remember seeing a 6502 die shot (I think that's what it was called) when I was starting to learn about CPUs in general and someone was talking about how it proved that there was no decimal mode and I was just thinking: &quot;HOW THE **** CAN YOU SEE THAT? WHAT THE ****? IT'S JUST A BUNCH OF LINES!&quot;. Haha anyway, in a few years I hope to be able to look back at this and laugh <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />. My priority of finishing this emulator remains though.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />For a moment, I thought about making C10H15Noid, an Arkanoid clone where the IRQ handler makes up part of the subroutine that handles removal of a block from the field. If the emulator breaks BRK, it'll break breaking bricks. This way the player can see that the emulator is BRKing bad.<br /><br />But then I realized that the 6502 itself breaks BRK when NMI happens at the same time, and that's probably why games don't use it.
