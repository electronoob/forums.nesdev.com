<br />
<br />my ppu is working but needs work still.  any suggestions of why i dont get anything displayed ?
<br />
<br />just looking for some clues to what is wrong with my ppu...

The simplest way to detect the result of a test would be to monitor the nametable for the text printed on screen when a test completes. It'd be quite simple to write a scripting system that had primitives for checking for text on screen and sending joypad commands or loading new ROMs in response. This would accommodate all current test ROMs that print a result on screen. I might even whip this up and post it, if any actual interest is shown in automated testing.<br /><br />I'll keep 32K mappers in mind (the non-switchability of the last bank for more complex mappers had been stuck in my mind). That would be fairly easy to use with very minimal changes to my current code; it'd just involve replacing the "forever: jmp forever" that all of them jump to with code to switch to the next bank. It would also solve the limited devcart space issue: just test each bank separately. Heck, I could even have it automatically receive the next bank over the serial link from the host PC. :)<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">Unless you're testing audio, you could have it play music while it's testing.</div><br /><br />Heh.

<br />
<br />I checked and Fx3's problem was with the Sprite 0 Hit test ROMs. I didn't see any code in the PPU VBL/NMI timing test ROMs that would cause a blank screen if the VBL timing was off (and it doesn't make any use of sprites). mattmatteh, reply with a precise description of what you did and what the result is, since it's unclear what you mean by "my test". I don't know if you mean "When 1.frame_basics.nes is run in your emulator, you get a black screen for a minute" or something else. This goes for everyone: post precise descriptions of the context of your problems so that others can avoid having to assume things to fill in the missing details. Did you let "1.frame_basics.nes" run for at least half a minute to be sure it never showed anything? It takes a while before the result is displayed.

<br />For tests that are that long, you could at least give some sort of indication that something is going on. Would cycling color 0 work?

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I really don't like adding anything extra to the test code that can be handled just as well in a readme (if someone can't be bothered to read it, then the level of accuracy my test ROMs verify is probably not their aim anyway). I'm sure the tests could be made really nice, but the effort and bugs due to unexpected effects make it not worth it in my opinion. I <em>have</em> improved the final reporting, but that runs after the test so there's no danger of it affecting things. Everything else is geared for making the tests as error-free and easy to write as possible. It's already a very time-consuming process.
<br />
<br />Rather than put all the responsibility on the test ROM, why not develop some guidelines and frontend designs for emulators so that it's easy to add automated testing to one's emulator? When running tests, it wouldn't even show any PPU video on screen, just a console with the results of each test. The emulator could run at maximum speed, making the tests quite fast.

<br />
<br />1. Yes, 2002h is read exactly 1 PPU cycle before VBlank.
<br />2. There's a second 2002h read that occurs 56 PPU cycles after VBlank (1).
<br />
<br />- That's what I traced carefully. Both reads should return 00. Mine was returning 80h on second one. I'd like an opinion about this "fix"...
<br />
<br />a) On VBlank rising, if 1 PPU cycle has elapsed since the last 2002h read, a flag (M) is signed.
<br />
<br />b) On second 2002h read, if (M) is set and 56 cycles have elapsed since VBlank, so 2002h returns bit #7 clear.
<br />
<br />- It's clear to me about a)... but b) looks like an hack.

<br />I'm not sure what you mean "a flag (M) is signed". If you replace that with "bit 7 of $2002 is not set for that frame" then that is the correct handling. A simpler way to state this is: "On VBlank rising, bit 7 of $2002 is set <em>unless</em> $2002 was read 1 PPU clock earlier."

<br />
<br />Nintendulator <strong>isn't</strong> GOD or anything. Just because something fails on it doesn't make it wrong. If you read up on Nintendulators CPU timing you would see that it does nothing of the sort that WedNESday's does. Question for blargg, would WedNESday's perfect timing fix this issue? I assume that it would.
