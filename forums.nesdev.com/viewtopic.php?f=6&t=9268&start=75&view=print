It's slowly becoming my fav tool for NSF listenings and recordings.<br /><br />However I have a big problem - when I load NSFE files, the track names are completely out of order and had to manually rename the songs after recording. <br /><br />Also, would you consider writing an NSFPlay plugin for Foobar? That'd be amazing.

There is an option to ignore the NSFe playlist in the options, if you'd rather it just play all the tracks in their original order.<br /><br />A foobar plugin is something I'd like to support in the future, but it's not a priority right now (still need to get through an accuracy pass on all expansions, then a performance pass). I'd also like to add a playlist editor, so you can make and edit NSFe or M3U playlists easily, but this has similar priority.

The MP3s were recorded using Winamp itself, with stock/default in_yansf.ini settings (i.e. what comes in the .zip) with no adjustments.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />In general, when taking a new version of NSFPlay, the in_yansf.ini should not be carried forward from the last version, though I do try to keep changes that would break things to a minimum. Unfortunately FDS_OPTION0 does break FDS playback with the old value, due to the complete rewrite and the removal of the 2 options that were originally there. It's now a lowpass filter cutoff, and its default value is 2000.<br /><br />The Bio Miracle thing is interesting. I can't find any non-emulated videos on YouTube or Nico Nico to compare against, unfortunately. I dunno what it is, though. A mod-table halt condition that didn't show up in my tests? Maybe I can fit a playback log of it into a hotswap test. (NSFPlay now has a logging feature via LOG_CPU, by the way, though I haven't made a UI or documentation for it yet, which I will do before 2.3 is released.)

I at least wanted to make you aware of it, in the case that it turns out to be an oddity in the emulation rather than the rip; if you're taking notes of NSFs/titles which need further investigation, I'd say add that one to your list.  I have an FDS, but the likelihood of me being able to get my hands on a Bio Miracle Bokutte Upa FDS disk is slim-to-none.  :/<br /><br />Edit: I can't even think of a way of getting an .FDS image onto my FDS/Famicom, for that matter.  Can't use my PowerPak (even if I made a 72-to-60-pin adapter) because the entire Famicom cart slot is taken up by the FDS with no pass-through, and I have no idea if there is hardware out there which lets you make/reproduce FDS disks (as in the physical thing).

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />koitsu: I can't get my FDS drive to read any disks at all (I changed the belt, and tried many times to realign), which is part of why it's taken me so long to get around to testing this stuff. I have an FDSLoadr cable, but so far the complications of acquiring a parallel port and DOS to run it on have prevented me. Maybe I'll try to get it going today.<br /><br />I don't immediately suspect the NSF to be a bad rip, though that does happen from time to time, obviously. I've noticed that most emulators seem to reset mod-table phase on $4085 writes, which I was not able to duplicate in my testing. Possibly $4085 does reset if the mod-table is halted? I've got some more tests to do. If I emulate it this way (phase reset if halted) it eliminates some of the weirdness, but not those sliding tones around 17s.<br /><br />zzo38: just turn off the &quot;automatic playtime detection&quot; option, and the &quot;stop the song automatically&quot; after silence option.

If you have a way to play Bio Miracle on it I'd like to hear what it sounds like, but I don't think I would get much benefit from it if I had it.

I won't go into that, but the parallel requirement is complete nonsense, it just happens to be a &quot;convenient legacy way&quot; of strobing 11 individual pins that go to the FDS RAM cart.
