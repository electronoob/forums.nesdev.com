<br />
<br />Please explain to me why this is a monumental problem that requires perverting the standard as opposed to just dealing with the overdump.
<br />
<br />According to bootgod's database, this is the ONLY game for which this is true. (Although it is also true of the Game Genie ROM.)

<br />
<br />Your proposal can be another way to make things work. 
<br />
<br />But now let's talk about 1, 2, 4kb roms that Zepper was once mentioned
<br />If we can allocate one mapper number for those irregular sized rom, we can solve all the trouble with a waste of just one mapper account.
<br />For example, let's say we are allocating mapper 028 to these irregular PRGed rom.
<br />
<br />----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<br />Mapper 28: mapper for the simple type roms with the PRG rom size smaller than 16kb
<br />
<br />* In this mapper, the 4th byte of iNES header is used to indicate the size of PRG rom instead of the number of banks it contain. You can kind of think it as a page count of 1kb pages, although it may not be technically correct to say so. The only acceptable value for the page count byte is 1, 2, 4, 8. Under these numbers, the PRG roms are mirrored to fill 8000h~ffffh address region. The behavior for the roms with values other than 1, 2, 4, 8 is indetermined, i.e. emulator specific.
<br />
<br />-Header setting: N, E, S, 1A, 0x(size of PRG rom in 1kb's: 1, 2, 4, 8 possible), 0x(size of CHR in 8kb's, usually 1), Cx(0 for h. mirror, 1 for v. mirro, and so forth...), 10, 00, 00, 00 ,00, <em>actual rom image starts form here</em>
<br />
<br />-Examples:
<br />N,E,S,1A,04,01,C1,10,.... : a rom with 4kb PRG, 8kb CHR with vertical mirroring
<br />N,E,S,1A,08,01,C0,10,.... : a rom with 8kb PRG, 8kb CHR with horizontal mirroing (Galaxian)
<br />N,E,S,1A,02,01,C3,10,.... : a rom with 2kb PRG, 8kb CHR with vertical mirroring + battery save.
<br />
<br />----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<br />In this system, we can catch 4 birds with one stone. Not bad, isn't it?

<br />Make another mapper, or you can adjust the mapper that I've supposed to incorporate the irregular CHR using the method.  
<br />
<br />However, the mapper that I am suggesting is primarily for the Galaxian, and I don't feel any obligation to make this mapper to incoporate every unrepresentable form of roms in iNes. If you have your own need for a certain type of a rom, that is curruntly unrepreseted by iNes mappers, I guess, than it is your time to find your solution. Don't bark me about that.

<br />Purist collectors would care, as you've pointed out in this topic. Perhaps the only difference is that Galaxian is commercial and LJ65 isn't yet, or that LJ65 was developed after the NES's original commercial era.

<br />
<br />I think that would be sensible that instead of numbering the number of 16K PRG banks, it could be... a power of two of the numbers of bytes of PRG. So if there's 2 x 16K PRG, the number should be 15, 2^15 = 32K. So, using this system, we can define both insanely small and insanely big PRG sizes; to specify a PRG of 16 bytes (why? Memblers may answer...) the number should be 4. For a 8Mbyte game (why this?!) the number should be 23, 2^23 = 8M. The problem is, there should be a limit for this number, because even with only 5 bits we can specify a 2GB PRG size — waaayyyyy too much. But he main advantage is that we can make both very small and very huge PRG ROM.

But other thing now to think about is that this will limit the CHR size to 255kb at most.<br />So we have to make a choice between 4kB + 4kB rom and 4kB + 1MB rom. If you are programming a graphic viewer PD rom for NES, you may prefer to use the second format.<br /><br />Allocating 2~3 mappers will solve this, but people were already going insane about wasting 1 mapper.

<br />
<br />Due to the limitation of NES hardware, PRG with larger than 32kB and CHR with larger than 8kB requires some form of memory management. What this means is that without a dedicated mappers, these rom will not work on emulators. Because of this, they cannot share mapper with the undersized roms.
