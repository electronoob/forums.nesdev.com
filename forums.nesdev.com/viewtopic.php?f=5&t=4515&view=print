<br />Basically its my DualShock 3 controller, which under Control Panel-&gt;Game Controllers does actually appear with the correct name and settings too. Of course there are no drivers for the controller which means that whenever you try to calibrate it you get no response. Since my computer recognises the device, could I still use DirectInput (which I have always used for my keyboard) to access it, or since there is no driver would I have to go in directly with USB access?
<br />
<br />Edit: Since its recognised by Windows, does that mean that I could read data from the controller directly via DirectInput?

<br />No, that driver doesn't work for my computer. And sorry tepples, but the first sentence of that post means nothing to me.  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_lol.gif" alt=":lol:" title="Laughing" />

<br />A lot of cross-platform games are developed using a library such as Allegro, SDL, or ClanLib. This library exposes a generic API to read game controllers. Under the Windows version of the library, the generic API calls DirectInput. Under the Linux version of the library, the generic API calls the Linux joystick interface. Or under the Mac OS X version of the library, the generic API calls the HID Manager.

But anyway, under control panel my Dualshock 3 controller is recognised, and when I plugged it in it installed correctly and now appears under game controllers in the control panel (as a Playstation 3 controller with settings and calibrations). Even though there is obviously no driver for this (the one I tried didn't work (ps3sixaxis_en.exe)), could I still used DirectInput to read from the controller, or am I the proud owner of the world's most expensive paperweight?
<br />
<br />Edit: I've just read somewhere that USB game controllers that are HID compliant don't need drivers, is this true?

<br />Yeah. As long as it shows up in Device Manager and tests OK in the Game Controllers applet, you're good to go. Of course, controller-specific features (rumble, programmable buttons, motion sensors, etc.) usually won't work, unless they map to a standard axis or button.

<br />Here is how it appears under Control Panel-&gt;Game Controllers. Go to this page and scroll down until you can see images with all kinds of red circles on them. That is what I get in my Control Panel-&gt;Game Controllers, except nothing responds onscreen whenever I press any buttons.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />It's no use. After hours of searching the internet and trying all kinds of stuff, I just can't get it to work. The basic thing is, there're no drivers for this thing (at least ones that work for me). I can get it to show up in the Control Panel under Game Controllers, but cannot calibrate it and none of the buttons respond to it. When I plugged in my USB-&gt;PC Playstation controller thingy, it installed straight away (just like my Dualshock 3 did) but I could go straight into ZSNES and just configure the keys with it, unlike my Dualshock 3.
<br />
<br />So I've basically wasted £50. Great. Does anyone know of a person/software house that could write me a driver? I might be prepared to pay for services too.  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" alt=":(" title="Sad" />

<br />That might be more expensive than you think. Will probably make the money you've already spent on the thing look like pocket change.

<br />Yes! There are some new drivers that finally make the thing work now, but my USB dongle doesn't detect the controller. Does anybody know of one that will, or can provide information on the PS3's bluetooth capability?

<br />
<br />
<br />tl;dr WidComm or BlueSoleil allow more devices, and may be needed for it to work.
