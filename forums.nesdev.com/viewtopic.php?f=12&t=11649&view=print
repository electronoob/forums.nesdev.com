But most code comments I see contain quips that are not actually helpful.<br />This would actually bring me to tears of frustration on a bad day: &quot;echo Files produced by build tools go here, but caulk goes where?&quot;<br /><br />&quot;; 16x16 makes it a shitload easier to draw a player sprite&quot; :facepalm:<br /><br />Who is your intended audience. Maybe even state that in the text file?<br /><br /><br />Let's run this down as a typical n00b:<br />**I use Visual Studio in School to make programs, and now I wanna program a Mario game on SNES (or something)**<br />I downloaded the zip package.<br />I double click on readme.txt<br />it tells me in the text to use something other than notepad.<br />fine now i have to actually extract the zip package to a folder.<br />I now open readme.txt with notepad++<br /><br />I reach the sentence &quot;Building this demo requires cc65 for the PRG ROM, and Python and Python Imaging Library for the CHR ROM.&quot;<br />I am slightly puzzled.<br />I google &quot;cc65 for the PRG ROM&quot; as that is what it requires.<br />first google result takes me to &quot;https://github.com/cc65/cc65/blob/master/libsrc/nes/crt0.s&quot;<br />I am confused.<br />Go back to the readme file.<br />I read the sentence &quot;You'll probably also need GNU Make and Coreutils, which Windows users can find in MSYS&quot;<br />in MSYS?<br />&quot;MSys accepts high-end technology challenges and delivers quality solutions for our clients operating in numerous domains. Our commitment to the clients' success made the clients to get a superior-level of confidence and partner with MSys&quot;<br /><br />---<br /><br />Do I think the package you have is a very good start? Yes. Absolutely. A lot of work went into it.
