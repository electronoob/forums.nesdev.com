How big of an issue it is depends on the CPU requirements of your game, I guess. Especially when using WRAM I am more often CPU-bound than memory-bound, so I'd rather use more RAM and less CPU cycles.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3706">qbradq</a> — Fri Jun 17, 2011 11:34 am</p><hr />

Oh yes I guess I didn't understand your solution. Ironically in my unfinished game it's almost the same, except that since screens are always only one screen tall, the CameraY would rather be a constant that points to the uncompressed screen memory (there is only one at a time "loaded" into memory). So in fact this variable does not exsist.<br /><br />However I have something equivalent to your NTCameraY, that goes from 0 to 15 and warps arround, because my screens are less tall than the screen, because I have a status bar, so I need a variable to record "where" in the nametable my screen is.<br /><br />Not that this solution is good for 1-screen game, but if I was to make a game with larger multidirectional scrolling, since I have the normal Camera variables I'd rather use the same variables for nametable positioning, although there is absolutely no need to do that.<br /><br />I remember that I studied scrolling that there is basically two kind of approaches : The "camera" one where you always start at (0,0) (or wathever value it is) when rendering the screen, and then advance when scrolling is needed. The other approach, is to do some divisions/shifting from the camera positioning directly, it needs less variables, and the map will always be rendered at the same offset in the nametable, no matter where the rendering has started.<br /><br />I don't think one method is better than the other it's just two different approaches.<br /><br />And multiplications and divisions are not THAT slow. You say this as it would take forever for each one, which is not the case. For example if you wanted to do a sprite mazing routine that would need a division for each sprite (you remember someone proposed this not long ago...) I'd say forget it because you want to be able to maze 64 sprites in a frame, so you don't want to loose time for 64 divisions !! Then I 100% agree with you.<br /><br />If we talk about something like at most 1 division per frame, such as in the scrolling code, then it's really a non-issue.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=38">Bregalad</a> — Fri Jun 17, 2011 11:28 am</p><hr />

I definitely don't use often multiplications or divisions in a standard 2D NES game, but it's really handful to know how to do one.<br /><br />One common place where I think divisions are needed is if you do vertical scrolling. Because the screen is exactly 15 metatile high you have to divide your Y map position by 15 and can't get away with simple shifts. However it's pretty simple to do just look at my examples on the wiki.<br /><br />The most complex math I had to do was for homing projectile. I had to compute it's H and V speed based on player's X and Y coordinates, and the projectile's initial X' and Y' position. The formula to be used is :<br />HSpeed = (X-X')/root((X-X')^2 + (Y-Y')^2)<br />VSpeed = (Y-Y')/root((X-X')^2 + (Y-Y')^2)<br /><br />At first I did it with a lookup table, but then I figured I could do ALL the math in assembly, squared is just a multiplication by itself, division is pretty simple, and for the root... I used an example on 6502.org<br />I was surprised how well it worked to do all this in assembly without a lockup table, and the code to do the complex math took ony half the size of the lookup table (I used a 256 entry table) and was more precise so of course this is the solution I took.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=38">Bregalad</a> — Mon Jun 13, 2011 1:49 am</p><hr />

I avoid it like the plague, but I did have to use them for some tasks. I have used multiplications for effects in my (WIP) music engine, but I'm trying to find a way to get rid of them. I also need multiplications for angled motion of my main character, like when he's on slopes and such. I obviously needed a lot of them in <a href="http://nesdev.com/bbs/viewtopic.php?p=50964#50964" class="postlink">my raycaster</a>, because of all the trigonometry.<br /><br />I believe that most NES games don't need multiplications though.
