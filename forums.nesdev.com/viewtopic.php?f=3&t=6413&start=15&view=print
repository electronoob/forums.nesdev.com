<br />Moving up and down can mean that the timing is off. Battletoads, for one, needs the CPU to insert an extra cycle for taken branches across 256-byte boundaries. How does your emulator do on blargg's timing tests?
<br />
<br />If the screen changes while a sample is playing, this could mean one of two things: <ul><li>The program is stuck in a tight loop updating $4011, and ordinary graphical updates are paused. This is likely because BT, like Balloon Fight, uses a cycle-timed NMI handler to load sprite cels and turn on rendering late. </li><li>DMC DMA steals about four CPU cycles each time it fetches a byte. </li></ul>

<br />There is an _extremely_ high chance that it does not pass all of them. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" /> Once I get back to debugging my CPU/PPU cores I will run the tests for sure.  What happened was I got bored with debugging my CPU/PPU cores so I decided to move on to the APU - and I fully implemented the DMC.  Then I got board with having to test with the same old NROM games over and over and OVER! So I decided to implement some mappers which is where I am at right now. Plus, having a larger variety of games allows me to better test my APU implementation when I go back to it!! <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />
<br />
<br />I am going to save your notes, tepples, and put them in my bugzilla database so I can reference them when I return to debugging the PPU/CPU cores.
<br />
<br />I don't want to waste anymore of your guys time with grabbing at straws since I know for sure there are existing bugs in my cores that I need to fix.  But man, you guys figuring out my AxROM mapper bug from just watching a video and not having any code is frigin amazing!  Maybe one day I will be that good? LOL
<br />
<br />Again, thanks so much for all the help! NesDev RULES! <img src="./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":-D" title="Very Happy" />
<br />
<br />Pz!
