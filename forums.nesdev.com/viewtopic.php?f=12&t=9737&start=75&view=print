This one is NOT the same you copied in your private message and I don't understand those chages... There must be something else you are missing.<br /><br />A20 - A21 - A15 are the only address bus lines you should use to activate SRAM and to enable the EPROM, just as Nintendo does with MAD-1 (although it sometimes uses A22 too, but it is not mandatory qhen using only 1 ROM chip).

With that one, I could load and play 16mbit games, but it wouldnt work with my backup circuit. The one I posted here allowed me to save in 16mbit games, but thats all. So i figured this one was closer than what i had previously...and I didn't want to keep flooding your inbox  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=":wink:" title="Wink" /> <br /><br />I am checking through the truth tables, and they are starting to make a little more sense to me. Its late here though...so maybe its just the sleep deprivation talking  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" /> <br /><br />BTW, thanks for the &quot;extra&quot; push INL...i keep putting off truth tables because they look crazy, but this will help me out in the long run! Once I have things figured out I'll post my schematic here and maybe you can tell me if I've figured it out correctly  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_cool.gif" alt="8-)" title="Cool" />

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />The difference is because Magno's design ties A15 to both inputs of the first decoder, so A15 high enables (active-low) Y3 and A15 low enables Y0.  By tying the second input to Vcc, when A15 is high, you enable Y3, and when A15 is low, you enable Y2.  Other than that, your decoder is doing exactly the same thing as Magno's.

When I've looked, it was also fairly difficult to dig up the programming mechanism too.

Just need an accurate Hi-ROM 139 wiring specs to go forward.<br />Mark</div><br /><br />I.C. switches? Do you mean DIP switches, or do you mean multiplexer chips?<br /><br />On HiROM, A15 from the edge connector goes to A15 of the rom chip, A16 goes to A16, A17.... and on and on. So you're involving everything from A15 to A22, and more conventionally using the uppermost address lines as chip select.<br /><br />You still ignore A23<br />the memory maps into the 64KB pages of banks $40-$7D and $C0-$FF.<br />the /ROMSEL (/CART) signal is still important to consider, so you don't conflict in bank $7F with Work RAM.<br /><br />To be in that bank range, A22 is always 1. This is a problem for the reset vector, and interrupt vectors in general, upon powerup, which is at bank $00, of which A22 is obviously 0. So you can't care about A22 being low or high.<br /><br />So this leaves you with A21...A20... etc.<br /><br />The $FF:FFFF - $C0:0000 spans 0-$3FFFF, so 4 Megabytes (or 32 megabits might be more familiar).<br />If you had a quantity of 4 of 1 Megabyte chips, how would you wire up the 74139 decoder?<br /><br />If you had only 2 of 1 Megabyte chips, how then would you wire it up, to be sure that the CPU still sees the reset vector at $00FFFC–$00FFFD from at one of the ROM chips?<br /><br /><br />(I'll stop here as I'll admit I don't know how to map the Save RAM into HiROM at this exact moment.)
