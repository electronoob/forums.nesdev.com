<br />
<br />it just seems from a programming standpoint it's more intuitive to list a bunch of addresses, as opposed to a bunch of (address -1).  but of course using RTI to jump somewhere is counter intuitive in itself

<br />I'm pretty sure Square and Enix fusionned only in 2002 or so (long after the SNES are), but isn't this common practice ? The SNES was designed so "direct pages" can be easily canged to any page.

<br />
<br />is the main reason why RTS with address - 1 is slightly better because you have to PHP before the RTI?

<br />
<br />There are multiple ways to accomplish things on all architectures, especially 65xxx, and I really don't see anything "wrong" with having multiple options.  There's pros and cons to everything; maybe the advantage over using said method was that there wasn't enough ROM space for a jumptable?  (I had a HELL of a time fitting the Demiforce intro and graphics into what was assumed to be leftover ROM space in Final Fantasy 2 (Jap))
<br />
<br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">I'm pretty sure Square and Enix fusionned only in 2002 or so (long after the SNES are), but isn't this common practice ? The SNES was designed so "direct pages" can be easily canged to any page.</div>
<br />
<br />No, this is not common practise in any way shape or form.  I've worked with 65816 since 1989 until 1995 (Apple IIGS and SNES/SFC), and the method I described (setting DP to $2100, or $C000 on the Apple) was incredibly rare.  On the SNES/SFC, it was seen more and more as time went on, but it was hardly common -- it was mainly done during very cycle-sensitive routines (where every cycle counted -- that's much more important on the NES/FC than it is on the SNES/SFC.  Chrono Trigger is one such game, for the record), or during SNES register initialisation (e.g. after power-on/reset).
<br />
<br />Setting DP to $2100 on the SNES/SFC only saves you a byte and a cycle or two when reading/writing to DP, and forces you to use long addressing or some complex equivalent for accessing other RAM.  So ultimately, it depends on just how much memory-mapped register accessing you're going to be doing, wouldn't you agree?  :-)

<br />Well, I didn't know if there had another trick with those ZPageVars that could be even better than the "normal" jump table trick. In fact using RTS for jump tables is faster and slighty smaller than using indirect jmp (), so I use that instead, but that makes the jmp () opcode almost useless  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_cry.gif" alt=":cry:" title="Crying or Very sad" /> 
<br />
<br />I guess nothings prevent you to set the DP to $2100 in VBlank to write to a lot of registers, then set it to some normal value like $0000 again at the end of the update routines.
<br />Altough since the SNES has hardware DMA which is even faster (since there is no op-code fetch at all) many programmer would use that for VBlank updates as well. The reason FF6 or Chrono Trigger did the $2100 DP trick is that they use one DMA channel for sprite-DMA (which is essential) and the remaining 7 for mid-frame HDMA effects, so they had no DMA left, forcing them to do the updates "by hand". Most games would not use that many channels for HDMA, and use them for DMA updates instead. The reason that many HDMA channels are used is the pretty text boxes (they could also have used IRQs instead to free some HDMA channels).
<br />
<br />Yeah SNES-dev is very cool, altough the CPU is weird.
