I'm still having the Mario Bros bug, and I was wondering: how likely is it that this bug is caused due to the lack of dummy reads/writes? I heard that those should apparently also be used in some instructions, but I haven't implemented them. My emulator passes NESTest (official opcodes) and NEStress perfectly (CPU-wise), so maybe it's related to the lack of dummy reads/writes? Anyway, I thought I should consider this possibility since I can't find a mistake in my CPU to save my life. Any thoughts?<br /><br />PS: It seems that the green/red fireball type sprite thingies that randomly appear on the screen, don't have trouble moving to the left. It's just Mario and the &quot;live&quot; enemies.

I can't keep asking you to just fish in the dark (or whatever the saying is). I'll try to capture some footage of the emulator running tomorrow, and I'll upload the source of the CPU core then as well (just give me some time to clean up all the BS print lines, rename some variables and maybe add some comments).

I also have a method called checkNOverflow which checks overflow in the case of subtraction, and does indeed check if it's less than -128, and it works. I think something that simple would be picked up by NESTest or NESTress, but it wasn't.

I did not know that. I didn't think it could harm anyone, and I'm not sure if it's considered bad practice in Java as well. <br />2. They do check in the increaseCycles method. <br />3. No. I'm using something called &quot;wrappers&quot;. Byte, is my custom made wrapper, while byte is the Java primitive type for an 8 bit signed value. Using a wrapper like Byte enables me to use a byte with extra functionality and without having to go like this all the time: a &amp; 0xFF or x &amp; 0xFF. Since Java doesn't have an 8 bit unsigned type, I use a method in my custom made wrapper which just does this: <br /><br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">public int getVal() { <br />return val &amp; 0xFF; <br />}</div><br /><br />4. Yeah, again, using a Byte (which is an object) is different than using a byte (which is a primitive type). Doing what you did (N = Z = A &amp;= DataBus) would basically screw my program into oblivion and beyond. <br /><br />The reason my coding seems f'd up is because Java programmers generally work towards: clarity, readability, maintainability, etc. This is preferred much more over performance, and of course I would change it to make it faster/more compact/etc, but like I said, this is the first thing I've done this low level, and I still had to get used to Java's signed/unsigned crap which I also only started learning about after I had started the emulation process. <br /><br />On my level of Java, performance and compactness of code is not yet that big of an issue. Other than those Java/convention-specific issues, not much seems to be wrong with my code, does it? <br /><br />Maybe it's the fact that my CPU runs for an entire frame before actual sprites are drawn? I mean couldn't that cause some kind of synchronization issues? I doubt it, but that might be something to look after, no? I quickly implemented Mapper 2 and Mapper 7, and while some games work fine (Metal Gear, Megaman) a lot of games mess up in huge aspects (Contra (keeps falling through the ground), Battletoads (complete f'd up obviously), Marble Madness (same as Battletoads), Castlevania (idem), Ducktales (bumps into faulty opcode), and some more). I suppose maybe I should implement a cycle-specific PPU and use the catch-up method to make them as synchronized as possible. Maybe that could help. <br /><br />Any thoughts?

I thought addition checked &gt; 127 for the overflow flag, and subtraction checked &lt; -128 for the overflow flag. Does that mean I need to check both &lt; -128 and &gt; 127 for every instruction, or just ADC and SBC? The overflow flag did confuse me, but not this much O_O
