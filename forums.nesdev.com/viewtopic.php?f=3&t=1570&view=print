		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I was trying to play a game which I downloaded from Romnation on the NES using my Devcart. The game played perfectly on FCEUD but on the NES the graphics were completely off as if the mapper was accessing the wrong bank of CHR ROM. I know the particular ROM was from a battery back up MMC3 cart which I used-TKROM. Any ideas why the game would play perfectly on FCEUD but with the wrong graphics on the NES?

<br />Radia Senki - Reimei Hen (J) [T-Eng1.0]  on Romnation. When you play it is called Chronicles of the Radia War in the translation. In the header it is listed as having battery back-up WRAM so I tried it on a TKROM but the graphics were almost invisible as they were on a TSROM. Strangely on a TLROM with no extra RAM the graphics were more or less visible but too scrambled to play the game. I don't know how to use Goodnes although I tried it. Any instructions? Any ideas?

I have had problems with mainly translations of Japanese games. It seems that the code can work on FCEUD and Nintendulator but not on the NES. The orginal Japanese ROM's work fine but we can;t play them. As far as I know the various flavours of MMC3 carts are fairly compatible with the exception of CHR-RAM or WRAM. There is no problem with dirty contacts as I installed a new gold connector and have an official NES cleaning gadget.

<br />I know for a fact that there are plenty of bugs in it, particularly in its PPU and APU emulation (evident by the fact that most of blargg's advanced tests fail in it), but some of those are exceedingly difficult to fix properly. I don't know of any bugs that would cause this particular game to fail, though.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I couldn't see why transltator would change the code of the game to use tricky frame IRQ timing issues or mid-scanline PPU writes or anything that still cause problems under Nintendulator.
<br />Translations normally does just change the game script and tile graphics. Sometimes they change code too, but that's pretty rare. In most case it will just change the width of windows, or some interface stuff. If they happen to programm something wrong here, it will normally not work under nintendulator, unless they try something really tricky, but I really couldn't see why changing some small piece of sript could crash the game, if it works under nintendulator.
<br />
<br />Are you sure you didn't try a NTSC game on your PAL NES or something ?

<br />Unless it runs into an edge case where the timing is related to the length of a line of script, unwittingly exceeding the limitation of the text engine.
<br />
<br />Quietust: Could you document some of the more major bugs on the wiki?

<br />What zip files should I download from blargg's site to see the tests that fail? What zip files should I download to get the most complete and up_to_date version of the APU tests? (Specifically, I'm confused as to whether "validated_apu" is up to date or out of date.)
<br />
<br />As of version 1.29, Nestopia seems to pass all of the blargg_ppu_tests (unless my blargg_ppu_tests is out of date), branch_timing_tests, mmc3_irq_tests, sprite_hit_tests, and sprite_overflow_tests. That leaves sprite_hit_timing to be tested. Assuming that Nintendulator is comparable to or better than Nestopia in most of these areas, I'm guessing that most of the problems are in sprite_hit_timing...?
