<br />
<br />Other than that, the controls feel OK, better than a lot of commercial NES games (many of them didn't even have any sort of acceleration, inertia, etc). Once you implement platforms we can stand on it will be easier to judge the controls I guess.

<br />*edit* found something. If you jump, then release and hold A again before landing, the dot will jump back into the air again. I think the standard way to resolve this it to keep a history of button presses, and check for a transition from released to pressed, rather than simply whether it is pressed or released. It looks like you may have this partially implemented, since the dot will stop jumping if you hold down A indefinitely.  Not sure if that was what you were looking for---you may have had this refinement in mind already.

<br />Hehe, yeah I just noticed that as well. I am just resetting the "don't allow another jump" flag in the wrong place (oops!).

<br />Are you saying perhaps I'm letting it jump too high? I was thinking the same thing. I was thinking maybe I would make it jump less high from a stand still and jump higher (like the way it is now) when running.

If you have IRQs, hiding the top and bottom 8 scanlines is very easy, and will get rid of all the glitches. If you don't have IRQs you can still blank scanlines, but that will require timed code and/or sprite 0 hits. Fact is it is indeed possible to completely get rid of scrolling artifacts, it's just not the simplest of the tasks. In my game I have a timed NMI routine and I blank the top 16 scanlines (and I also use the time for extra Vblank transfers).<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">65024U wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">For scrolling multiple ways, you might want to make some extra RAM on the cart and use One-screen mirroring.</div>
<br />If by extra RAM you mean 4-screen, then yeah, that would be the simplest (from the point of view of the software, I'm not sure how hard it is to modify a cart) way to get rid of scrolling artifacts. One-screen on the other hand would make things worse, because you'd have glitches both horizontally and vertically.

<br />Ah yes, that seems like an elegant way of handling things. Right now I'm at the "wow I can't believe I'm getting anything to work phase", so changing anything that I've already written seems a tad scary. But It's nice to see things in a new light, I think I'm finally starting to understand this NES Dev stuff. I might graduate from noob school by the end of the year even, lol.
<br />
<br />Thanks to everyone for your help. This community is great!

Theoretically, you can add WRAM to any board you want (although this community can't seem to agree on the best way to do it, there have been some <a href="http://wiki.nesdev.com/w/index.php/PRG_RAM_circuit" class="postlink">suggested circuits</a>), but no official CNROM carts have it. Maybe you meant MMC3 (mapper 4)? Either way, WRAM isn't absolutely necessary for handling compressed maps, there are plenty of other options: on-the-fly decompression from ROM, partial decompression (only the part of the map that surrounds the player needs to be in RAM), and so on. But if you want to go with WRAM, that's a valid choice. It will make the cartridges more expensive though, in case you ever decide to manufacture them.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">But It's nice to see things in a new light, I think I'm finally starting to understand this NES Dev stuff.</div>
<br />I think you are doing well... most people here (me included) take years to show any results. It's usually because of lack of free time though, rather than lack of knowledge or potential.

<br />good point. I'd like to have the option to reproduce the end product when the time comes, but I also really want to have destructable backgrounds. I guess I just need to weigh my options.

<br />If you want to be able to destroy the whole level, then yeah, you are going to need the extra RAM, but if it's something around 2000 blocks or less you can probably remember the states of those using just the regular RAM. You just have to create a way to associate the groups of destructible blocks to the bitmaps that represent their state.
<br />
<br />In case it looks like it, I'm not trying to talk you out of using extra RAM, I'm just presenting some options you might not have considered, so that you can make an educated decision, or "weigh your options", like you just said.

<br />We had <a href="http://nesdev.com/bbs/viewtopic.php?t=4706" class="postlink">a discussion</a> on those. Mapping destruction state to game objects is a tradeoff of memory vs. geometry restriction vs. code complexity. I came up with a compromise in which the engine restricts the map geometry to have only one destructible object per column of the map.
