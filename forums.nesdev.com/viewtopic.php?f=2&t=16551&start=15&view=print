		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Since the m235 earlier dumper script should have worked to produce an accurate (if non functional) image, the only real question is whether you got a valid dump.<br /><br />If you have a hex editor or similar, you could check if the entire file is the same 16 KiB repeated over and over.<br /><br />If you don't have a hex editor, you could try just compressing the resultant 4 MiB image using zip or 7zip or rar or something. If the result is <em>tiny</em> (like, 16 KiB-ish) then that also indicates that the file contains a gazillion repeats of the same data.<br /><br />If the entire file indicates the file is the same repeated 16 KiB over and over, then you'll either need to temporarily disable the reset detection circuit, or maybe there's a way to tell Kazoo/Anago/Unagi to drive M2.<br /><br />We still would need to figure out how to encapsulate this image; with multiple noncontiguous ROMs it's a particularly bad mismatch to the iNES format.

Given that the only hardware on the board is two 74'174s, a 74'139, and a 74'153, it'll be pretty easy to reverse-engineer it even without knowing what mapper it corresponds to.<br /><br />Ideally, we'll find that &quot;MK008&quot; ROM somewhere in a thread and be able to writeâ€”or maybe even find already existingâ€”the kazoo script from that data.<br /><br />BUT IF WE CAN'T: this board is simple enough that we know approximately how it's going to work: Twelve of the pins on the two '174s are going to connect to the card edge; two will go to the 74'153, and the other ten will go to the three ROMs. Sitting down with a multimeter and determining what pins connect to what pins will let us tell you exactly what the hardware is doing, and then write a script from that.</div><br /><br /><br />Alright, I did a conductivity test on the board.

Here in attachment the first 32kib of the dump using the very first script you gave me.<br /><br />Do you think I need to remove one side of the diode also?
