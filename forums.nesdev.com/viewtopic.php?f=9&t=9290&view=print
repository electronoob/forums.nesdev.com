		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I want to make a dev cart with 8KB of CHR-RAM and four screen mirroring. I remember reading around here that it would be OK to use a single RAM chip for the entire PPU space, but how would I go about wiring everything?<br /><br />I'm using a 32KB RAM chip, so I know I must connect the highest address line to either +5V or GND to make it behave as a 16KB RAM. I also know that I have to connect CIRAM /CE to +5V to disable the internal name table memory, but I'm not really sure about the rest of the procedure. Do I keep the RAM chip always enabled, ignoring CHR /A13? What about CIRAM A10? Since the internal RAM will not be used anymore, does it matter what I do with it? Is there anything else I'm forgetting?

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I think you just have to tie CIRAM A10 to a known state which really doesn't matter and then connect CHR /A13 to your SRAM /CE. Plug all the address lines at the respective place. Then, if your SRAM have separate /WR and /RD line, you can connect these directly to CHR /WR and CHR /RD, otherwise for a R/W pin you just connect CHR /WR to it and I think it'll do the trick.

CHR /A13 should be left floating.<br /><br />*CIRAM A10 tie to Vcc or GND.  DO NOT leave it floating.  Alternatively you could use a trick if your board has H/V solder jumpers you can just close one of them, doesn't matter, just makes it cleaner with your board.  The ONLY requirement is that it's not floating.<br /><br />Keep in mind this has nothing connect to a mapper of any kind. And mirroring is fixed to 4-screen.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">BTW, don't the palettes get in the way since the RAM chip would be active when $3F00-$3FFF is accessed? Or does the fact that palette RAM is internal to the CPU make the external data not matter?</div><br />So I was thinking about this too.  If I understand it correctly it won't matter.  The address bus and control signals should be vaild when reading and writing to the palettes.  So what'll actually happen is you'll store the palettes internally in the PPU and on the cart, and you'll also read from both of them.  Since they should both agree after<strong> intializing </strong>them it's really a non-issue, they shouldn't conflict or cause issues.

Think of what $2F00 writes would normally do. Reads from $3Fxx are passed on; they fill the 1-byte read buffer even though a mux makes the CPU see the palette value instead.<br /><br />As for &quot;pretty much all the time&quot;, I learned years ago on the gbadev BBS to qualify a statement if I haven't tried it myself.

My shortcut doesn't actually implement H/V mirroring, it's just a trick to get a valid logic level to CIRAM A10 to keep it from floating.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">Yeah, this is meant for simpler mappers that only affect the PRG.

On the other hand, since 8KB of RAM will be mapped at $2000-$3FFF, $3xxx will not be a mirror.</div><br />Oh yeah you got me, even though you'd now have specific memory mapped here and not a mirror, the same logic applies.  I guess it must not assert CHR /RD either otherwise it'd conflict for reads.  So long story short, it's a non-issue.<br /><br />EDIT:<s>But, on that note...  I always questioned those mirrors at PPU $3000-3FFF and where/how they are mirrored to exactly.  You&#39;re suggesting $2000-2FFF Tepples, but why?  The $3xxx would suggest PPU A14 is high, A13 is low, and A12 is high &#40;binary 101 = decimal 3&#41;.  So the mirroring exists since PPU A14 is only internal.  Externally A13 low and A12 high is only seen at the cart which would be $1xxx.  So in reality pattern table 1 is always mirrored against the palettes and this conflict is avoided by CHR /RD and CHR /WR not being asserted when PPU A14 is high I would imagine.  However if that were the case the mirrors wouldn&#39;t exist at all and $3xxx would all be a memory void aside from palettes, so if the $3xxx mirrors exist, CHR /WR /RD would only be kept from being asserted when the palettes are addressed.</s>

So the RAM has A12 and A14 tied together, but how does that appear any differently than tieing A14 to gnd/vcc?   You effectively made 32KB work as 16KB which is what we already had.  The only thing different is how things are arranged in the SRAM, as far as I can tell it's all going to look the same to the PPU.<br /><br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">I just though of something else: since $3000-$3F00 will not be mirrors anymore, could I use that as an extra 3840 bytes of RAM accessible through the PPU bus when the PPU is not rendering?

I suppose that might help out a bit if you're trying to keep yourself from using WRAM huh?  Basically $3000-3F00 just become cumbersome scratch pad, or a good place for save storage if battery backed etc.  EDIT: oh and if you released a game making use of that space I'm sure some people would be motivated enough to configure an emulator to support.
