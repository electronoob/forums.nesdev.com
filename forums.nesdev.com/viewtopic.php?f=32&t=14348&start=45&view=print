I'm guessing that's ok for my submission, but it might have to be changed later, correct? The rules weren't totally clear about how to use the mapper, and the wiki seems more targeted at implementation than usage.

I think it was targetted to help motivate entrants to complete the judging so they can boost their own chances of winning.  It's simply mentioning that as an entrant, you are welcomed to be a judge (for all entries including your own).  Since you are your own judge, you have the benefit of being able to give yourself the highest marks/grade when scoring your entry.  That doesn't mean you *HAVE* to give yourself a perfect score.  But everyone else may be doing so, its more of a potential for an extra 'bonus point' for your score if you take the time to complete the judging.<br /><br />It is a little confusing, and giving yourself unearned high marks might lack modesty for some..  Perhaps an equal but less confusing method would be to have entrants not judge their own work, and simply give all their entries a bonus point if they take the time to submit their scores for judging all the other entries.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />It is now perfectly clear, thanks.<br /><br />I would find it hard to score my own games for full points taking in account the fact that I consider some of the entries superior. That would not be fair. The thing is that maybe other entrants will do it, which wouldn't be fair in turn. So I really don't know what to do.<br /><br />I would prefer that entrants didn't have to rank their own games, but I'll adhere to the rules.
