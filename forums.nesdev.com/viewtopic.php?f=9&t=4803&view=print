		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I was thinking of getting one of those FC Mobile (Portable NES) units off ebay ($50 free shipping), and even though the buttons are swapped (A on the Left, B on the Right), you can't go wrong with the price and it seems like a great unit (there is a youtube video of a guy that unboxed and played it). 
<br />
<br />Has anyone bought one of these and tested it with a PowerPak? 
<br />
<br />thanks!

<br />the appeal of this thing is it's portable. I already have an NES (with RGB mod) but I wanted something portable. especially because it's cheap and plays NES games without a cartridge converter. I wanted to know if anyone has actually tried the PowerPak on this thing. I once had a Super8/Tri-Star adaptor (play NES/Famicom games on a SNES) which was based on the NOAC and it worked fine.

<br />
<br />If I got one of these, the first thing I'd do is rip it apart and fix it. That is an unacceptable oversight.

<br />It's too bad that (as I understand it) these famiclone makers tend to have no customer service in North America, Western Europe, or the Australia area. Otherwise you could complain that Lode Runner doesn't work right, as it depends on A being on the right.

<br />So does Section Z. B fires to the left, A to the right.
<br />
<br />Any other games have a similar control scheme?

<br />
<br />Gunsmoke, I think. Press B to fire diagonally left, A to fire diagonally right.
<br />
<br />I totally agree that it's completely unacceptable to swap the buttons. This completely undoes what programmers tried to do to make comfortable controls.

You are better off using the PocketNES emulator for the GBA, if you want a portable NES.  The PocketNES's emulation is better than the FC Mobile's hardware-level cloning, in my opinion.

<br />Or NesterJ for the PSP, which has a full GUI and a crapload of features (hardware scaling is pretty sweet). Unfortunately, the emulation accuracy floats somewhere between NESticle and FCEU at times, especially in timing-sensitive games and homebrew. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" alt=":(" title="Sad" />

<br />Double Dragon 2 also relies on the button order to work.
<br />Altough I've seen an annoying game (it way Joe&amp;Mac Caveman Ninja) where the progrmmers had the most stupid idea ever : B is for jump and A is for attack. Maybe playing that game on that stupid famiclone is the only way to play it with good control.
<br />
<br />I eventually found a NES emulator for the DS that is really good, I don't remember where I got it tough. And an accuracy close of Nesticle's still allow you to play about 90-95% of games with no or minor graphic glitches.

<br />
<br />Caveman Ninja! I used to live in a hotel/resort in the middle of nowhere, and one of the few arcade games they had was Caveman Ninja =). Oh, so wonderful. I didn't know they had a NES version until you posted that. But now that I have acquired a copy, I see the graphics are pretty good with the parallax and stuff.
<br />
<br />But yeah, I hate when the buttons for attack and jump are reversed. I don't know which is more annoying: buttons being reversed, or trying to play GBA games on the DS.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Personally I've had no problem playing GBA games on the DS, even action games. After all the Jump button is still on the right of the attack button, no matter if this is 'B' 'A' or 'Y' 'B'. All you have to do is to translate your fingers a little horizontally.
<br />
<br />The worst is when playing Genesis games. I only played a few emulated, but no 2 games seems to have the same control sheme. So I have to deal with that or to change the button config on the emulator each time I change the game.
<br />
<br />EDIT : Oh and there is also plenty of SNES RPGs where 'A' is okay and 'B' is cancel, but then Playstaion RPG have X for okay and O for cancel, which is exactly the other way arround and it's really annoying. PS2 RPGs tends to have X for okay and Triangle for cancel, which is different enough to not mess up.

<br />And to make things even more confusing, Japanese PSPs and their games use O for okay and X for cancel (which really does make more sense), and homebrew authors can't seem to settle on one scheme, or even provide an option to switch them... x_x
