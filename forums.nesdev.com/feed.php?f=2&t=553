I agree that Batman Return of the Jocker has impressive graphics, but the gameplay SUCK. I mean, when you press jump, batman takes at least one half of one second to actually jump, and the same for attack. It just sucks. So I'd MUCH preffer smaller sprites, because big sprites (often) ruins the gameplay. What about the failure of Battletoads in battlemaniacs on the SNES ? The games takes the same characters than in the NES battletoads games, but this time your toad will nearly have the same size as your screen does. How fuck.<br />Also, Megaman 7 is totally ruined by the fact that the sprites are too big, making boss-battles impossible, scince you'll get more hits (megaman is bigger), and you'll get even more hits (the boss is bigger), and you'll take more hits above that (the boss attacks has a bigger range), of course, the screen still have the same size than it was on NES.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=38">Bregalad</a> — Tue Dec 13, 2005 10:06 am</p><hr />

Super Mario 3 just uses the Mario sprites' priority bit. Problem with using the priority bit is that you can't have a single sprite both in front of and behind a tile, so you have to make your backgrounds with solid colors in order for it to work that way.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=9">tepples</a> — Mon Dec 12, 2005 1:46 pm</p><hr />

I think that the sprites hiding the players or maybe people of a RPG town or enemies of a platformer may easily be disabled if nobody is behind them. Scince someone is behind them (even only a part), they should be present, and then only the sprites with lower priority should be cycled, anyway, so they'll always be present even if the sprites they're hiding are disabled because of scanline limitation.<br />I think doing plaing effect should be first  set trough the background bit of each sprite's status, and only if the stage's graphics really needs it, to use that method.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=38">Bregalad</a> — Mon Dec 12, 2005 1:45 pm</p><hr />

In SMB 3 you can move behind the retangular areas in one of the early stages.  You need to find a white rectangle platform and press down for moment, Mario then falls behind the rectangular structures, even the end of the stage background.  The effect only lasts a few seconds but it was one of the coolest things I have ever seen in a NES game at the time.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=241">danimal</a> — Mon Dec 12, 2005 1:36 pm</p><hr />

And masks MUST be present if the sprite they're masking is. So, each mask means one less visible sprite (having the masks always present, not including them in the cycling, I guess). It sucks.

I'm now in front of the boss just after that black section, actually, using a lot save states makes that section possible, but I canot even imagine beat that without savestates.<br />Now the boss looks just impossible, damage it is nearly impossible and avoid its mini-missiles attack is even more harder.<br /><br />About special effects, I always asked how hard would be to make animated BG witout using tile animation via CHRAM or CHROM, but doing it with organized nametable writes. Typically, in my MMC5 RPG, I won't be able to do CHRAM animation because of exgrafix mode, but I'd be able to change the high offset of each tile during a frame (not in VBlank) like Just Breed does and/or to change normal tile index in VBlank.<br />I'd also like use the fact that a black sprites in backround with higer priority hides a normal sprite in foreground with lower priority to allow my player to pass behid threes and stuff, having it a multi-layered look. The main problem is that with 8-sprites per line limitation and sprite cycling that will be hard to do. Having a 64 byte buffer that would be randomly acceded significantly to assign a correct number to each sprite with still the defined priority would be the only way to bypass it. 64 bytes of RAM is tolerable for a game using SRAM, however it's a lot for a game with only 2kb of RAM without SRAM.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=38">Bregalad</a> — Mon Dec 12, 2005 1:09 pm</p><hr />

I'm not sure if this would be considered a special effect, but I noticed something cool on the first level of Zen: Intergalactic Ninja.  When you are at a certain position on the screen ("closer" to the bottom of the screen) and jump, the sprites switch up to bigger sprites to make him appear to come at the screen.

since we're back at this, there is one game that got my attention immediatly: Bucky O'Hare.<br /><br />It is not impressive in a "distortion" or "3D" kinda way, wich is what usually gets more attention. The game is a platformer, (my favorite kind of game!) and applies a lot of little effects to make the NES look less lame when compared to the 16-bit consoles of the time.<br /><br />The ice level has a nice layer of water that moves, and what's below it has a darker tone, simulating dark water. And if that's not enough, there are some sprites (frozen chunks?) floating by to increase the effect of transparency.<br /><br />The game does a lot of parallax scrolling and simulates layers by animating background tiles. It combines parallax with sprites so you think huge moving objects can overlap. It has some huge background animations, that you don't usually see on the NES, as it is so slow to update the BG.<br /><br />I can't even remember half of the cool stuff present in that game. Just run the game and don't even play, watch the demos first. I was amazed. That game is a serious competition to 16 bit games.<br /><br />And it is not only pretty to look at. As a platformer fan I found that very amusing too. Each level has a unique gameplay, the bosses (the ones I saw) are nice too. You can change characters during the level, characters who have different abilities.<br /><br />It easily bacame one of my favorite NES games.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=95">tokumaru</a> — Sun Nov 20, 2005 3:07 pm</p><hr />

Sorry for bringing up this old dead thread, but I was just going to say that I was officialy impressed when I saw this game that I borrowed from someone, it's called Al Something jrs Turbo Racing. Oh my gosh. I'm more impressed at this than Cosmic Epsilon. This gives you more 3D than Mario Kart on SNES. There's a concept of hills! You round corners and whatnot. You can go up/downhill. Go download the ROM, you'll be impressed.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=138">Celius</a> — Sat Nov 19, 2005 7:22 pm</p><hr />
