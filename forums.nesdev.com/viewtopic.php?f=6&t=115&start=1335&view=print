<br />I'm afraid your luck has ran out, as Gil_Galad I believe is retiring from NSF ripping. I would learn 6502 to rip NSFs myself, but hearing how hard it is, I don't think I'm going to. Only thing I do know remotely is a little C++ which I don't think helps in NSF ripping. I asked Gil for a fix for J League Winning Goal because it's missing 5 songs (the game has a sound test) but he didn't fix it. All we can do is hope that somebody new comes along who can rip NSF files.

<br />
<br />ValleyBell has done this already, you can log NES music to VGM with a custom built MESS. Doesn't work for games using additional chips, and I can't say that I've tried doing anything with it, so can't really tell if it works as intended, but it's out there.

<br />Don't tell me there are still problems with Klax. If not, I may have to look at it again, but yes it was a difficult fix.
