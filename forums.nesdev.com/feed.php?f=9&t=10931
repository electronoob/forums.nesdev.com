Thank you kindly for the reply rainwarrior!<br /><br />So by using a regular EPROM burner i could dump this cart? Sorry for the newbie questions, but does the CHR and PRG come out as two separate files that i can save in the computer and in the future then eventually burn them back on the EPROMS? I mean, after they have been dumped. Or is there a more complex procedure?<br /><br />The game is just an old generic multicart which uses EPROMS rather than Globtop circuits (In other words pretty old). The name is &quot;Top 15&quot; or something and i bought it from a childhood friend in the early 90s, who bought it in Thailand. So i did not really think it was necessary to add, but you are right.

The simplest way to be sure you're dumping all the data is to desolder the ROMs and dump them directly. If it's a Famicom cart they're likely standard JEDEC pinout, I think?<br /><br />Once you have the data, you can figure out the mapper in various ways.<br />- You can examine the board visually, it might use discrete logic circuits, for example.<br />- You can add a custom mapper to an existing emulator (FCEUX's source code is readily available, for example) and try to figure out what the mapper does by watching writes in the debugger and guessing what they're supposed to do, guess and test, back and forth until it emulates correctly.<br /><br />If you don't want to desolder the ROMs, you can just start by dumping as 32k NROM and seeing how far you get by running it in a debugger (probably not far). This will involve a lot of back and forth, tweaking your dumper to try to guess the new bankswitching method. This is a lot more tedious than having desoldered the ROM because you have to keep re-dumping every time you try something new with the mapping.<br /><br />You could also tell us what the game is and we might know about it. Why the secrecy?<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=5165">rainwarrior</a> — Sat Jan 25, 2014 9:31 am</p><hr />

Hello everybody! ^^<br /><br />I would like to get some help from you guys. I have an unlicensed FC cart which probably does not use any of the standard mappers. I would like to dump this cart for preservation purpouses only. Therefore i do not really care about making it compatible with any emulators or so, but i just want to be able to dump and re-program the eproms if they by some reasons stop working.<br /><br />I have been looking into various dumpers like the CopyNES, Kazoo and such, but since i have absolutely no knowledge about these matters, i could not really find any information about how to do it, since the mappers supported by these dumpers seems to be just the standard mappers. Or can i just dump the information (and re-program it to the EPROMS) with any dumper no matter which mapper the cart uses? (I mean, being able to dump the CHR and PRG)<br /><br />What about an EPROM reader? Maybe that would work if i desolder the chips. The soldering part would be no issue, but i would prefer other options if available.<br /><br />Could somebody please try to explain to me in a very simple way? This cart is just a cart that has big sentimental value to me, and i just would like to preserve the content for the future.<br /><br /><span style="color: #00FF00">Thank you in advance. I really appreciate any input. </span><br /><br />Ps. I do not think this cart is already dumped, and even if. I would like to do this, as a project. Which also means that i do not look to send it away to a person who can dump it. I hope you understand ^^  Thanks a lot!<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=6365">Xexyz</a> — Sat Jan 25, 2014 8:51 am</p><hr />
