		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I don't know if there is much differences between the revisions of SLROM. Usually revision added coupling capacities, or slightly changed the layout. This should matter few if the game works or not. To personal experience, SNROM-03 always lost saves due to the lack of a coupling capacity on the SRAM, wich was added in SNROM-05.
<br />Maybe it's just a coincidence and your SLROM-03 boards are dirty. Mirroring don't affect characters themselves, it only affect the screen setup. I think it was also a coincidence that your CNROM board worked better after changing the mirroring. Mirroring should only affect the graphics when scrolling, where a lot of glitches should appear on the background, but not on the character itself.

Else if you want to make your own hardware goonies, it shouldn't be hard to modify the CNROM board so that it act like Goonies board, I guess you just have to tie A13 on the CHRROM to A14 on the mapper, and you're done (I'm not sure tough).

Just hack the game to use CNROM and you're done (no rewiring needed). I think the hack that is already arround works with bus conflicts, so no problem here.

<br />If you get nothing at all (not scrabled graphics or anything) then you should have something wrong on the PRG side.

I'll probably just pick up a Famicom cart and use one of my Gryomite boards. Thanks for the help though. Would it matter if I disabled the CIC chip on board the nes? It hasn't been an issue on any other game. But that's the only thing I've done to my nes.
