		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />And I decided to port a couple of FF7 songs to the Sega Mega Drive using Deflemask. The Mega Drive's chip is definitely weird and interesting, some things are ridiculously easy to do and others almost impossible. I like to cheat and use a single 4-op instrument to simulate 2 2-op instruments, in order to get more channels.<br />What do you guys think ?<br /><br />EDIT : Changed the song according to comments (see below).

For Parochial it sounded like an organ and for Reactor it was noise.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I've done exactly that sort of &quot;cheating&quot; for just-intonation perfect fourths (3:4 frequency ratio) and perfect fifths (2:3 frequency ratio) in TFM Music Maker. Use the algorithm that looks like this:<br /><br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">&#91;Mod1&#93;-&gt;&#91;Car1&#93;--.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; |<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;(+)--&gt;&#91;Out&#93;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; |<br />&#91;Mod2&#93;-&gt;&#91;Car2&#93;--'<br /></div><br />Correct me if I'm wrong, but I think it's algorithm 4.<br /><br />This will produce intervals so long as the ratio between the &quot;multiple&quot; values for carrier 1 and carrier 2 is something like 2:3 or 3:4. To ensure the same timbre for both voices, make the ratio between the &quot;multiple&quot; values for modulator 1 and carrier 1 the same as that for modulator 2 and carrier 2. Then you can make major, minor, or suspended triads and their inversions by using this instrument on two channels, with carrier 2 of the second channel muted.

You can string together 4 in a row to create more complex sounds, or you can have them in pairs of 2 which sacrifices complexity of timbre in favor of either &quot;baked&quot; harmonies (similar to sampled chords), or detuned unison/chorus layering.<br /><br />A few existing games do this to get around the 6 channel limit for harmony. Thunder Force IV uses a bunch of different instruments/patches with different intervals like fifths, fourths, major/minor thirds, etc. These are then combined to create those juicy 4 tone chords at the expense of only 2 channels.<br /><br />Now, a much less used &quot;cheaty&quot; yet fully hardware supported trick is to sub-divide FM channel 3 and control each operator independantly, so you can effectively treat that as 2 separate 2op channels which is a lot more flexible than relying on static, pre-programmed intervals in different patches.

It doesn't even use any tricks like the other two song does to increase the # of channels, it simply uses arpeggio on PSG channel.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">I also did some music.

It doesn't seem to even use much of the VRC6 features and could almost be a 2A03 only. Not that I like to bash your work, but I'd rather be honnest and give negative but constructive feedback rather than lie and say I like it.
