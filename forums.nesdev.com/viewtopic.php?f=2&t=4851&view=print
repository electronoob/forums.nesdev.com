		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I notice EWROM have some compatibly with RAM/ROM mapping for Disksystem Adapter. I hacked Disksystem Bios for MMC5, replaced Program ROM, exchaged Charcter ROM to RAM. Iceclimber diskversion (FMC-ICD) worked on MMC5.
<br />Another game is worked (CLD, ICE, TC1 + TC2, VBW, AKM)! I named this attempt 'MDC5' (Multi Diskimage Control for mmc5). 
<br />
<br />The problem is that interchangeability is not complete. My attempt is inferior compared with Power Pak and FDS loader. I think it is technically interesting. I want someone to cooperate in development because it takes time. 
<br />
<br />I want upload some stuff, but I don't know best upload space....

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />- Extra Sound
<br />This problem cannot be evaded. I choose that games does not use extra sound.
<br />
<br />- Save file system
<br />It needs more Program RAM area, I have to find Program RAM extra address A15-A16. 
<br />
<br />- Patch system
<br />To control scroll mirroring, timer interrupt and swapped disk, Games read and write $402x and $403x without BIOS. It must be patch for MMC5 control registers.
<br />
<br />- .fds to .nes converter
<br />4M bit ROM can include 7 (or 8) diskside. The latest converter can concat FDSs and make NES header. It cannot link Patch system and disk mapping infomation. I write assemblely source, and have linked by hand power.

<br />The problem of the capacity of RAM was solved. ETROM have two RAM space. W-RAM-0 and W-RAM-1 can use each 0x8000 byte RAM. I found undocumented RAM mapping for MMC5.
<br />
<br />W-RAM-0:
<br />mappable $6000-, $8000-, $a000- and $c000-$dfff. data is battery-backuped.
<br />
<br />W-RAM-1:
<br />mappable $6000 only. It is not connected with the battery.

<br />I see on the boards that with the correct uses of solder pads, either chip can be battery backuped and not battery backuped at will. The default config is W-RAM-0 with battery and W-RAM-1 with battery, but can be changed.
