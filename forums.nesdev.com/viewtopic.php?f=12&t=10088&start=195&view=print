I think the FFVI issue on the 4MB carts was solved (bad caps?). Have you tried yours in a different console?<br /><br />UPDATE: Same result on Super Famicom version, only issue is I have no idea what anything says. <br /><br />Tested as Me...Rock Man that time. Wow, he sucks compared to Forte.<br /><br /><br />Also, here's a pic taken with a potato showing my cart mod. It's very precise.<br /><br /><img src="http://i.imgur.com/SlPNfrK.jpg" alt="Image" /><br /><img src="http://i.imgur.com/ROKCmaz.jpg" alt="Image" />

I went ahead and ordered an 8MB and 4MB so I'll have all the variations to play with. Right now I'm totally geeking out on this, and I can't wait for the sram reading and writing. I've tested probably 10 SNES games and too many SFC to recall. So far I've only had issues with FFV.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Rockman &amp; Forte should work fine. Games that won't work include the usual suspects like games using SA-1 (Super Mario RPG, Kirby SS, Kirby DL3), Cx4 (MMX2,MMX3), and Super FX (Star Fox, Yoshi's Island). Other games that might not work are games that use more than the available amount of SRAM.<br /><br />INL I think said that he currently limits the 128KB SRAM to 8KB. This would mean the few games that need 32KB will not work. Very few games fall in that category. Games that use SRAM based copy protection will need patches unless they are checking for 8KB of SRAM. <br /><br />Generally speaking, INL's carts will run any game as long as they don't require additional hardware of a chip such as SA-1. People can experience problems ofcourse and may experience it with certain games and blame the game. But it's not like that game won't work, it's some other problem that the user is experiencing.

What's special about this 32Mbit/4MB game ?</div><br />There have been issues (some widespread) with certain games on the 4MByte boards. We have yet to determine exactly what's causing it, but it's suspected that the consoles are at fault. Here's the current thinking; Different power loads from different computational processes tend to trigger it. This is unconfirmed, I've yet to personally have access to one of these trouble devices, wether it be cart or console, so I can't finish troubleshooting. It's a strange issue that's been hard to nail down - we have various reports of some Final Fantasy series games and Crimson Echoes and a few others being problematic, however, all of the ones I've been able to test have worked fine with the 4MByte board. Fruther testing is required, my first recommendation would be to try another SNES, or another power supply for the SNES. Yes, I know, other things work, that's why this is such a problematic diagnosis.

Perhaps It would be helpful to keep track of working crc/md5 checksums and report if an invalid or untrusted checksum is found in a future software release ?</div><br />I've heard the same about Crimson Echoes, but I haven't looked into what has to be done. I've been working on some manner of tracking for source files, and some of the infrastructure within the app is already in place. The problem is that the best infrastructure for that would be a centralized database and a report system, and that's a bit beyond my scope right now. I don't have the means to run tests on such a bulk of sources, and GoodTools/No-Intro would be a valid source, but to my knowledge they lack data on data ordering and so forth, so all I'd have there is a database of valid ROMs and their checksum data. That would help avoid the whole situation of having an outright bad ROM, but wouldn't help terribly when it comes to &quot;this ROM needs to be re-ordered before write&quot; and I'd have to fall back to the same case-by-case exceptions, of which I already support several. The real problem comes in that once I find a ROM that needs a special-case exception, I have to find out what that exception is - most ROM info tends to be for emulators, and tends to be along the lines of &quot;XX emulator supports this, use that instead.&quot;  Not very helpful for us real-hardware people, hah..

I did get Front Mission to work with a patch, but it was a pre-patched rom, so I might be doing something wrong here. Classic Kong tho, thats complete homebrew with no ipas, so I dunno why it wont work. Anyway, the client (11_5) crashes when this happens.
