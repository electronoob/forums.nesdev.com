		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I know the GSU-2 is able to address larger ROMs than the GSU-1, which is only able to address 8Mbit, but does anybody know FOR CERTAIN what the max addressable ROM size for the GSU-2 is?  There is a boatload of misinformation out there on the GSU-2 vs the GSU-1, so please don't just repeat back what you think you've heard elsewhere, unless you actually know for certain that it is accurate.  I'm thinking of making a SuperFX dev cart, and I'd really like to know if there is any point in putting anything larger than 16Mbit on it, other than to build a multicart, which I'm not looking to do.

I don't see why you'd need to worry about having anything more unless you plan to write new software for the Super FX and need more than 16 megabits addressable. <br /><br />If you don't true the pinouts, you could trace between the ROM pads on the board and the GSU-2 chip.<br /><br />Here is an old FAQ with pinout. <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.snescentral.com/0/0/7/0077/sf2_faq.txt">http://www.snescentral.com/0/0/7/0077/sf2_faq.txt</a><!-- m -->

So then how is it possible that both are grounded?</div><br /><br />both are grounded because there is no need to disable ROM chip since no bus-collision can occur. MaskROM's output is connected directly to SuperFX and it's this one who decides to pass-through data from MaskROM to SNES's data bus; this way, MaskROM can be always enabled, although this is not optimal from energy consumption point of view.<br /><br /><br />If the cartridge has SRAM, then again the GSU is responsible to enable SRAM chip when needed, and no collision occurs because SRAM's output is connected directly to SuperFX in a different data bus than MaskROM's.

On doom pcbs one of them connects to the gsu2 instead of ground.  I wired a gsu 2 conversion to have them both grounded, worked the same.

I'll have to test my flash ROMs and see if they work with /OE grounded.  It does, unfortunately, mean that I won't be able to reprogram them on-cart.  Oh well... at least the CX4 doesn't do the same thing, so I won't have that issue with the MMX3-based dev cart I'm building right now too.

I guess there are still some unknown opcodes, among other things, probably timing related.
