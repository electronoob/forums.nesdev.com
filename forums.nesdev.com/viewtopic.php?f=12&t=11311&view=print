		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />After a lot of issues with a home made tsop to willem adapter, the chip finally would ID and program. I then tried to make an Earthbound repro, for personal use only. The donor cart is Madden '96 which has 16mb mask rom with a 64k sram chip. I removed the header with snes purify, but don't think there was one on it to begin with. Programming went smooth and it verified. Soldered it in copying the orientation of the original mask rom, tried to boot her but got a black screen. Reflowed all my solder joints but that didn't help. I'm not sure what it could be really. The only thing I can think of is the rom is 24mb and the tsop is 32mb, but someone said you don't need to pad roms if they are smaller.

The flash chip is an m29f032d 70ns 4mb. Maybe it needs the rest of the hi addresses filled to work as the original rom is only 24mb. Would lunar expand work for something like that or is there a special way to do it?

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />That's pretty slick how you mounted the tsop underneath like that. I'm programming mine with the tsop mounted on the adapter. Just tried to burn a madden 96 with no header and unpadded to a tsop and play it on the madden 96 donor cart. It still gave me a black screen. Next I wondered if damaged the donor cart. Soldered the original mask rom back in and it played fine. At this point I don't know what the problem could be. Has anyone else used these m29f032d 70ns with a reproduction successfully?

It doesn't work because that solder is terrible. Probably cracked everywhere, and traces melted off the board.

Is the reset pin on the tsop pulled high?<br />I haven't traced your design out but, yeah, work on your soldering techniques.  Your solders should be smooth, shiney, and round.    I've never worried about heat though,  my iron goes up to 840 degrees and I always have it on max heat.  Many many years of soldering, never had a heat failure.  I can't even remember the lat time I used flux (yes, I know it's your friend) but I don't use it.  Tsop, dip, whatever...  I don't know what to think about your situation... Maybe you have address lines in the wrong place which would explain why it would verify but not work in the cart....

All I have is a madden 96 donor at the moment, and actually tried to bun the same madden game to a tsop and it wouldn't boot. I'll try to redo my soldering so all the points are shinny and clean up the left over flux. I'm not sure what you mean about connecting the reset pin to high but the rest pin connects to pin 10 VCC and pin 31 VCC.

But I've never understood how these boards program with the /WE tied high.    /WE has to be able to go low for the chip to enter programming mode and /WE either floats or is tired high through a resistor on these BuyIC adapter boards (and clones).   I have to tie a line to my /WE to get mine to program.  <br /><br />Maybe email me the game file you are trying to run and I can test it on my set up....<br /><br />Edit:  yeah, I see the reset pin tied high so that's ok....
