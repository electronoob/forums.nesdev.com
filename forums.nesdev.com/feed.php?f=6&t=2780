The only logged data I remember kevtris making was for the VRC7, back when it wasn't understood very well, and a VRC6 emulator written in QBASIC. Both of those took plaintext-based logfiles instead of a binary format, though, and I <em>think</em> CopyNES knows how to play both of them, but that's really about it.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=7">Quietust</a> — Wed Dec 06, 2006 4:00 pm</p><hr />

The advantages stated before of portability to other devices, too, are important.<br /></div><br />It sounds like you're arguing for a standardized NES logged sound format. NSF is even smaller, so logged doesn't win in size. A logged format still requires a specialized player. If you want portability, mp3 is the ticket.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"><br />Options that a normal end-user can employ to create/manipulate/transfer NES Sound.

Is it due to the obscure NES games that haven't been ripped to NSF yet? An interesting idea to handle that would be to turn a NES emulator into a standalone music player that starts a "track" using a ROM + save state.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"><br />anything that will allow me an unfettered access to a certain track immediately without editing NSF headers or modifying game code is a plus!

I'm still not understanding what you ultimately want to accomplish here. You're talking ways of doing it, but not what the overall purpose is.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">tokumaru wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"><br />Wouldn't logged sound also allow rewinding or random access to any point in the track?<br /></div><br />All sound formats allow this; it's just a question of how quickly you can seek.

Aren't there any games that use some weird routines to play their music that doesn't fit the scheme used in NSF's?<br /></div><br />Well, I really cannot find any. The worst thing that comes to mind would be merge some sound routines with some totally unrelated routines, wich no programmer would want to do anyway. The routine that would have nothing to do with sound could be "hidden" somewhere in the sound playback routine and freze the code if you don't run it with the complete game engine, wich is the case of NSF players. That would fit the NSF format by replacing a call by NOPs, but it would give a very very hard time to the NSF ripper.<br />Also, some code that would wait for a DPCM IRQ that would be triggered by not-sound code or a sound code that relies on mapper registers to run would be pretty bad. I know Low-G-Man relies on open bus at $6000-$7fff, and Just Breed relies on the MMC5 multiplier at $5205-$5206. Without those, both sound codes will crash.<br />Finally there is Battletoads with its infamous PCM playback (only on title screen, winning music and stage-advance-custcene music).

Most playback codes only communicate on song change and to play sound effects. Some games also have SPC dumps that doesn't work for some obscure reason, but that people have managed to get working on the SPC format (Terranigma, Fire Emblem 4 and 5, Super Famicom Wars and Rudra no Hihou comes in mind). Eventually, there is Tales of Phantasia and Star Ocean were the SPC run pretty well on its own, but have trouble playing some instruments and of course voice playback where the main CPU constantly communicates with the SPC700 to refresh sample data in a double-buffered algorithm.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=38">Bregalad</a> — Tue Dec 05, 2006 11:42 am</p><hr />
