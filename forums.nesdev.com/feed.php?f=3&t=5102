<div class="quotetitle">dreampeppers99 wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"><br />I'm just wondering ... do you deal with ppu cycling on your ppu class or even on emulator?<br /></div>Mine is written in C, so there are no classes.   My ppu code has its own time stamp or clock.  So if the cpu does 30 cpu clock cycles, then my ppu would do 30 * ( 3 for ntsc and 3.2 for pal) clock cycles.   Actually, cpu 5, ntsc ppu 15, pal ppu 16, you can find alot of info about that all over here.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=170">mattmatteh</a> — Sat Apr 25, 2009 1:31 pm</p><hr />
