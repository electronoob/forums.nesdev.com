		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Hi,<br /><br />Has anyone encountered any issues emulating Retro City Rampage? I'm getting garbled backgrounds in both the intro screen and gameplay. The nametables seem to be the correct ones, but the referenced CHR tiles are clearly wrong. The sprites seem to be rendering well. Apparently the game uses the 8x8 sprite mode in MMC5, so the bank registers used (A: $5120-$5127 or B: $5128-$512B) depend on the last set written to. The game seems to be assigning CHR banks to the B registers, but at no point did I detect setting of the CHR mode (which I assume is 0 by default). Writing to these 4 B registers leads me to think that the initial value for CHR mode should be 3 (1K banks) instead of 0, but all MMC5 implementations I have found seem to assume CHR mode 0 is the initial value.<br /><br />Does anyone have any experience with Retro City Rampage?<br /><br />Thanks

Indeed, I suspect the problem with Retro City Rampage is that I have yet to implement this. From what I understand, the MMC5 Ex Ram Mode 1 is intended to go around the limitation of tile attributes being shared by 2x2 tile groups and instead specifying independent attributes for each tile.<br /><br />Now that I think of it, the game does set the B registers without specifying CHR Bank Mode 3, but I suspect that since the game is using Ex Ram Mode 1, 1K CHR banks are assumed, regardless of CHR Bank mode.<br /><br />Am I on the correct track here, or am I spewing nonsense? <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />

One notable glitch is that the character dialogue at the top on starting to play doesn't show up. It does show up however, when you get out of the car and your NPC ally tells you to get back inside the car. The glitch may be due to IRQ counting code, but I'm not sure as yet.<br /><br />RCR Intro<br /><img src="http://i.imgur.com/KczVEDz.png" alt="Image" /><br /><br />RCR Gameplay initial dialogue (glitch here)<br /><img src="http://i.imgur.com/UO9sNOS.png" alt="Image" /><br /><br />RCR gameplay - driving car<br /><img src="http://i.imgur.com/IiQa6C3.png" alt="Image" />

Note that the issue isn't just the glitch tiles at the bottom, but also the blank panel at the top, which is supposed to contain dialogue between characters. Strangely enough, dialogue graphics do appear in mid gameplay, so perhaps it is due to some initialisation/IRQ issue.

If you run it on a PowerPak you'll see random sprite tiles on the screen at startup. (OAM decay issue, I think.)<br /><br />(Otherwise, PowerPak with Loopy's partial MMC5 does pretty much the same thing as discussed w.r.t. flickering text window, etc.)<br /><br />This game runs &quot;correctly&quot; only in the emulator that ships with Retro City Rampage. Don't take it as something a correct MMC5 emulation should run glitch-free.<br /><br />I'm not trying to diminish the value of his work, it's a fantastic proof of concept, but it is NOT a suitable test for emulation accuracy.
