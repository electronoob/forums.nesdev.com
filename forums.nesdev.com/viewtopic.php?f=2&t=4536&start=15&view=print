<br />Well, personally I prefer when dark color becomes black before light colors for some reason. I think it looks better, but you can disagree (that's why I proposed to do it that way as well for fade-in).
<br />
<br />I'll definitely use my technique for my games, and your table method sound like a terrible waste of ROM to me. It could be of some use if there were more brightness levels available, but for only 4 (5 including black) it's really not worth having all those table arround. But if it works that way for you go ahead for it.

Advanced techniques require more ROM and RAM, but if you are using a board that supports the extra memory there is no reason why you shouldn't do it.<br /><br />I'm using a bit less than 1KB for my brightness tables, and although it might sound like much for a NROM or CNROM project, it's nothing for a TKROM game with 256KB of ROM. I even have all my PPU updating routines in a separate bank, since they are not needed during game logic, and if I didn't have tables like these I wouldn't even be able to use the space for something else anyway.<br /><br />The method I presented is a perfectly valid option, and much more versatile than "subtract 16" as I've already explained, so please don't ditch it just because it isn't suited to your current project. If your next project uses a less limited board, you might realize that you don't have to be so greedy with memory. Some effects and performance gains are well worth the necessary memory, hopefully you'll see that.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">But if it works that way for you go ahead for it.</div><br />OK, thanks. And if you can get away without this kind of stuff, good for you too. There is nothing wrong with either approach, they're both valid options.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">Dwedit wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">I say try to imitate what other games did.

<br />Yeah, keep doing only what has already been done and nothing really creative will ever show up. We can sure learn from the old games, but even the programmers back then weren't perfect, you know?

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Depending on the project, it may be more important to optimize space, and it's good to mention that one method is more space-consuming while the other may be more time-consuming or not as flexible. If you're working with limited space, it's probably best to do as many calculations as you can without using up space with big tables. However, for very fast games (e.g. Sonic), you'd probably want to in the beginning give yourself more space so you can save time with tables. Everyone programs with different goals in mind. Some people choose space over time, and some people choose time over space. I actually don't pay as much attention to time as I do to space, though my goal in programming for the NES is to have as much complexity as possible. I gave myself 512k of PRG data (CHR is embedded in it), so I actually try and save as much space as I can so I can have lots of options. So since I have lots of space, and lots of compression, I can have really unique things everywhere you go. Not like Metroid with 256 different screens on a large map (I have 1024, and I don't even know if there'll be that many screens displayed). Though for my polygonal movie engine, time is way more important than space, as it needs to run at a decent frame rate.
<br />
<br />Anyways, I'm sure SSD will look at these options and probably get ideas from all of them to produce his own fading method. I actually got some good ideas from this thread, too!

<br />Definitely. Thanks for all the responses, gents. Even when I've more or less decided on a particular algorithm for doing something, I like to toss it up on the forums for discussion, because sometimes a great suggestion comes along that causes me to reconsider.
<br />
<br />Right now I'm using NROM for my project (32K PRG-ROM, 8K CHR-ROM). I'll eventually have to switch to something like MMC1, but I actually like working with extremely limited memory because it forces me to conserve space wherever possible. Once my data formats for maps, music, etc. are sufficiently compressed, I can give myself more memory to work with. At that point, I'll be able to have more varied levels, more songs, more enemies, etc.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Yeah, I'm actually going to make an NROM platformer so I can really teach myself how to conserve space wherever possible. Though it'll be pretty simple, and only have a few levels in comparison to SMB1. It'll probably have about 8 levels total, but with very different moods in each one. This might be difficult with only 8k of CHR. I also find it really hard to work with CHR ROM because it's so limiting. I hate feeling really limited! Though it's good to know how to work with what you have.
<br />
<br />And when you move on, you'll probably be able to put all music in one bank, all maps in another, all enemy data in another, etc. Though there are some things you'll want to combine if you're not filling the whole bank up. And map data might span across multiple banks. In my game there's a system where I define all the metatiles in one bank, and in another I define all the screens which are composed of those metatiles, and then in another I define the rooms which are composed of those screens. So it's kind of a step system. It takes a lot of space to do it like that, but I do have 512k, so I can get away with it.
