<br />
<br />In a typical render cycle (wait for vblank, turn off PPU, write VRAM, do OAM DMA, turn on PPU), do OAM and the palette really decay to the point where they must be rewritten every vblank? I did a few tests on my frontloader using games with a Seal, jiggling the Game Pak at various points: <ul><li>I tried Super Mario Bros./Duck Hunt in SMB mode and removed the Game Pak during gameplay. The sky stayed blue (blinking with black because of CIC resets) for a long time. </li><li>I tried Nintendo's Tetris for NES (NES-EI-USA). I held down on the cartridge and let it rise slowly, just enough to halt the CPU with a bad opcode on the PRG bus without affecting the CHR bus or the CIC chip. Once I got the program to stop in the middle of a note that continued playing, showing that at least some of the 2A03 was still being clocked, and the PPU kept on drawing the same image. Once I got the program to stop in what appeared to be the middle of a VRAM transfer, which I could discern because the background scrolled up and to the left a bit. Even without constant refreshing from the CPU, it appears the OAM and palette got refreshed by the PPU while the screen was turned on, even for several seconds. </li></ul> I'm planning a clone of Zoop with a screen update that, in the worst case (the color bomb), pushes the machine to the point where it already has to cut off rendering a few scanlines early, triggered by sprite 0.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Thanks. I ought to make a demo for measuring how long the PPU's internal OAM and palette RAM maintain their contents during forced blank (lda #0 sta $2001). Are there any special considerations for preparing a ROM to run on Squeedo, other than that it uses CHR RAM and 4-screen mirroring?

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Yeah, I really had to wonder about this oam decay thing ever since the first time I heard about it.
<br />
<br />Who found it out? From what it sounds like, it really does seem to decay its values, but I've never seen it happen, even on my carts that are really screwy and freeze the game due to bad connection.
<br />
<br />Though, it'd make sense if that this would happen when the screen rendering is turned off.

<br />
<br />The biggest thing I've noticed is using the reset button, currently the PIC is reset only at power-on.  So if you hit reset, the NES will be stuck in the currently selected PRG bank.  A work-around for that is to have a soft-reset routine in all your other banks to point to the main bank/reset routine.  Or just use the power button instead.
<br />
<br />Also, the first 4kB of CHR-RAM doubles as the nametable memory.  So you can only use half of the first CHR page for tiles.  The other 3 CHR pages are unaffected.

<br />
<br />All games which use 32KB PRG ROM switching do this, since the bank selected on POWERUP is indeterminate as well.

<br />
<br />Presumably M2 toggles keep a capacitor connected to the mapper /clear pin charged up, and a weak pull down drains it if M2 stops cycling, until it goes low enough to trigger a mapper reset, but I don't know what sort of values to use for R and C on my cart and I don't have access to my game collection right now.
