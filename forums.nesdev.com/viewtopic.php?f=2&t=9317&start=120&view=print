I'll look into that for future builds.<br /><br />Right now just kinda experimenting and feeling out the platform and dev tools and learning things like this.  I haven't done any console dev since the PS2 was new in stores <img src="./images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" alt=":(" title="Sad" /><br /><br />Of course it works on PowerPak, the bootloader/OS probably does a hot transfer to the game ROM with everything nice and ready.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I don't see this playing into the demo you've got now, but it's just a thought that occurred to me: Many games create a parallax effect by changing the scroll mid-frame (often multiple times). It's trickier because it requires timed code (or a suitable mapper), but it might be cool to change CHR banks mid-frame to get a similar effect combined with the parallax effect you've already got. You know, in case three layers aren't enough for you.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Yes, I've considered it and will probably do so when I go back to that one.  All the techniques including clean split scrolling with timed code and bank switching in hblank are already present in the &quot;test&quot; demo.  Implementing more would be trivial.   I'm limited by my ability to create assets at the moment.  For real use in a game setting I was thinking a sky parallax at the top, a dirt/rock/hill parallax in the mid to bottom, and a non square dilapidated Castlevania/Faxanadu (sp?)  themed brick structure in the foreground with bars/windows and holes and a wavy top to show the background layers with chimneys and trees and such extending up through both bg layers to emphasize them.  Its just a ton of tiles to make so its not my priority right now.<br /><br />Currently have moved on to experimenting with sprites, animation, and player action flow.<br /><br />Then some basic tile/nametable/coordinate/scroll libraries, collision detecting and event triggers, and tie it all together.  Already working on a bank layout that would all the effects shown in both to occur in the same rom where each level init brings its own NMI for unique level by level effects, etc.<br /><br />One baby step at a time.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Don't know how you guys ran these on PowerPak, neither of them worked on mine.<br /><br />For starters, I had to enable the right mirroring mode on the MMC3, it appears to override any PPU settings.  Emulators have this wrong it seems as I never encountered it before.  Both test.nes and crush.nes scrolled around garbage data instead of mirroring properly.  I played around with x/y scroll values to see and sure enough the horizontal/vertical mirroring wasn't what it was supposed to be.<br /><br />lda #$01<br />sta $A000 <br /><br />Fixed the garbage name table mirror on both and got &quot;crush.nes&quot; working perfect on the PowerPak (Ive added proper reset code to both).<br /><br />Next is what appears to be a Y scroll problem with &quot;test.nes&quot; where I'm seeing intermittent frames where the bottom half of the screen split at line Y=50 is aligned to Y=0 almost every couple frames where it appears to be overlaid over the correct version.<br /><br />Hitting reset a couple times gets lucky and resolved the problem for good until the next reset.<br /><br />This did give me some ideas about Sonic the Hedgehog style water effects though via frame interleaving and time multiplexing.  Could put the whole screen under water by a) flipping name tables to all water tiles every other frame and b) animating the water tiles.<br /><br />Apply some hblank sine waves and it might look pretty cool, and you'd get the automatic  slow down from 60 fps to 30 fps being under water <img src="./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" />

Since they're sprites, maybe it'd be a good idea to make hollow walls or and stuff like that, at least to give some extra room (also adds to the parallax effect as those parts aren't tied to tile alignment).</div><br /><br />Right, so no contiguous horizontal span of &quot;chomper&quot; edge can be more than 6 tiles wide  (assuming 2 x 8 tile player sprite) and no two horizontal spans can coexist on the same tile row.  This is only for the top layer, the bottom layer is static, but the top layer is getting real time single tile name table updates, hence need for sprites to hide the attribute glitches every other tile of movement.<br /><br />Also no enemies.<br /><br />Mine has no sprites yet, which is why I'm limited to the background sharing the same attribute value as the top layer.  <br /><br />Bucky O'Hare doesn't have this problem since it's horizontally oriented so it's 1 BG sprite per row leaving 7 for objs.<br /><br />The other limitation is the top section repeats and can't have any detail that doesn't repeat and tile vertically, otherwise features would scroll off the top of the screen or require a significan't amount of name table updates to move the entire top half rather than just copying the previous row.<br /><br />A few small details here and there in the top would be ok since its only needing to insert 32 tiles per frame for the scroll effect, plenty of room left to copy down a few inner tile features.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Hmm found my bug.<br /><br />Something to do with reading $2002 for vblank status for my main loop was screwing up the scroll registers.<br /><br />Looked something like this:<br /><br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">vblank:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;lda $2002<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;pbl vblank<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;; read controller and update x_scroll<br /><br />jmp vblank<br /><br /><br />nmi:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;pha<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;lda #$00&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;; top half screen coming up at 0,0<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;sta $2005<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;sta $2005<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;lda #$4F<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;sta $E000<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;sta $C000&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;sta $C001<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;sta $E001<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;pla<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;rti<br /><br />irq:<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;lda x_scroll<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;sta $E000<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;; do 06/05/05/06 timed code writes, <br />&nbsp; &nbsp;rti<br /></div><br /><br />Something about having an NMI handler and then when that quits, returning to a main loop that immediately reads from $2002 multiple times in a waitvblank loop.  Since my NMI would finish and I'd still be in vblank, my main loop would quickly run multiple times reading from $2002 (but no other registers).<br /><br />Somehow this was clobbering my scroll values, not sure how.  I didn't write to anything else in my vblank loop.<br /><br />I had NMI set scroll to 0,0 for the start of the frame and enable IRQ for the scanline break.  The IRQ just did the 06/05/05/06 writes for the split.  So the IRQ runs, it splits the bottom half, alls good... get to the NMI, reset screen position to 0,0 and somehow between there and my mainloop before IRQ or NMI triggers again the scroll gets all messed up and I see rapidly flashing alternating images.  I know the problem now so I can reproduce it at will for demonstration.<br /><br />I'm assuming the best course of action would be to set a flag in my NMI that is set at the start of my main loop and cleared at the end of the NMI that gives my main loop the go ahead to proceed and not touch the vid regs outside of NMI and IRQ.<br /><br />I'm trying to think why I had both.... it looks pretty stupid looking at it right now.  At any rate I've cleaned it up, works flawlessly on a real NES now.  What I am going to do now is something like this:<br /><br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">mainloop:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;lda #$00<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;sta READY<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;; read controller and update x_scroll and do &quot;game&quot; stuff<br /><br />not_ready:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;lda READY<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;beq not_ready<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />jmp mainloop<br /><br /><br />nmi:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;pha<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;lda #$00&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;; top half screen coming up at 0,0<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;sta $2005<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;sta $2005<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;lda #$4F<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;sta $E000<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;sta $C000&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;sta $C001<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;sta $E001<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;lda #$01<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;sta READY<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;pla<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;rti<br /><br />irq:<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;lda x_scroll<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;sta $E000<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;; do 06/05/05/06 timed code writes, <br />&nbsp; &nbsp;rti</div>
