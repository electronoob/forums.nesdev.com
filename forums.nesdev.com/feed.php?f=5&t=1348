Sure, but having ennemies sometimes get a break to the player will be better, unlike what you'd think at first. It looks more "user friendly".<br />Fire Emblem and Fire Emblem Gaiden have really really great AI. They are without a doubt the best games in that category for the NES.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=38">Bregalad</a> — Tue Apr 11, 2006 1:34 am</p><hr />

Well, I agree with tokumaru that memory size didn't have much to do with it. Even though the graphics are reused beyond belief, they still could have made those reused graphics better. But it's true that they were used to atari 2600 graphics back then when the NES was new and dominated the gaming industry (Oh, how I wish this still were true...).<br /><br />Okay, I'm deciding to not make a new forum for this, but I'm going to ask a new question. What game on the NES do you think has some of the best AI for it's time? My answer: Pacman. Those ghosts will always get you. They probably do something really uncomplicated for that, but I can't figure it out. AI is something I've always thought was amazing. Something I'm not very good at programming. Is it just me? Or is programming AI extremely difficult for you?<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=138">Celius</a> — Mon Apr 10, 2006 5:47 pm</p><hr />

Paperboy, too, look just so ugly.<br /><br />Dragon Quest has worse graphics than Dragon Warrior, because people only faces one direction, and the water has no border.<br />However, you'll have to notice that top-down games didn't really exists back then, the only one that was there before DQ was Ultima, I think.<br />However, what saves the graphics of Dragon Quest/Warrior to be pure horrible is how detailed the monsters are.

They don't bother to make it so the black part of the town will be the color of the grass, so it will look nice. SMB1 looks pretty bad as well. I was playing SMB3 yesterday (Which I beat for the first time straight through, every single level, took 5 hours), and I noticed that the graphics look wonderful, but the attribute updates look horrible.

The first games were really simple and undetailed, and it has little to do with the ammount of memory. Most of the time it is not a matter of how many tiles you have, but how well drawn they are. Sometimes we see GFX hacks of older games and they can look wonderful, just by lifting up the tiles and palettes a bit.<br /><br />We shouldn't blame older artists, though. For the time, those were OK graphics. Back in the beginning people were used to atari 2600 kind of graphics, where outlines were something forbidden. When the NES first showed up, artists took it from there, but using the new capabilities of the newer hardware. With time they learned to use dithering, outlines, and such things that usually make graphics look better. After a while, people noticed that cartoon'ish graphics looked really well on the NES, and that was used a lot.<br /><br />I guess it takes a while for the people in the game industry to realize the capacity of new systems. And when the system is finally mastered, a new one comes along. And the games of the previous system still get even better, as they try to mimic the games of the newer one. And eventually the system dies.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=95">tokumaru</a> — Sat Apr 08, 2006 11:03 pm</p><hr />
