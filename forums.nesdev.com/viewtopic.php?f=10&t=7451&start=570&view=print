<br />If you don't see smoke coming from your NES then don't panic...you haven't yet executed the self-destruct sequence.
<br />
<br />Seriously though...not sure how anyone can help you beyond the 38 pages of help you've already received if you can't set breakpoints and step through your own creation.
<br />
<br />EDIT: I crossed to the 39th page with my post but I'll leave my original count at 38 since my reply isn't "helpful".   <img src="./images/smilies/icon_eek.gif" alt=":shock:" title="Shocked" />

Review them in the source code, maybe you made a typo. Trace them, maybe you made a mistake in its logic and it actually works not as you think it will work. That's a general debugging, no one can really help without having full access to code and an explaination what and how it should do.

<br />
<br />To clarify, you logged from the very first instruction (power on), compared the log with your source code and cannot find an error? If you haven't done this, do it, especially if you have no idea what else to do.
<br />
<br />Are you waiting a couple of frames for the PPU to warm up before writing to $2006 for the first time? That's about the last thing I can really think of. 
<br />
<br />The main loop looping just means the main loop is working fine. There could still be something wrong before it. Your NMI could be doing something that affects your tile or palette writing, or who knows what else. As was said by shiru and cpow, there's not much we can say that hasn't already been said with the information we've been given.
<br />
<br />If you looked through a log from the beginning and even that didn't help, If I were you, I'd get rid of all the code except the absolute standard stuff (clearing RAM, waiting for vblank twice) before your main loop, which seems to be working fine. Reimplement each thing one by one. (Save the old code in a separate file, that's not assembled so it's not lost)
<br />
<br />I'd start with palettes. You said your palettes were all black. After getting rid of this new screen code, just put in what writes the palettes.
<br />
<br />If that works, cool. Try to put another small piece back. If not, well, I have no idea. REALLY check your NMI? I would actually start over if that didn't work. You've only got an NMI and a function that reads the joypad from the look of things.
<br />
<br />If it's taking you longer to debug than it would to rewrite you're losing time. If you choose to rewrite, keep careful track of changes so you don't run into a similar problem. Make sure each piece works before moving on.

I also did not spend the time to check FamiTone's code... one of his updates runs each vblank.

<br />What  do you mean by "a couple of frames"?  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />  My code waits 2 vblanks at the start. The first write to $2006 happens shortly after that when it is loading our palette into $3F00.

<br />edit: It was your focus on my palette... I was blessed to learn all of these debugging ideas!  I remember now I renamed my "palette" to "Apalette" and it was missing the capital a! Joy! <img src="./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" />

<br />Um OK but a debugger of any worth will show you what addresses are being loaded from either in real-time [an execution trace] or in design-time [an IDE with a "Go to declaration" option for symbols].  Best of all...for NES they're all *free*!

FCEUX for Windows in Wine lacks sound, NESICIDE for Linux runs at less than full speed on my machine and therefore also lacks sound, and FCEUX for Linux lacks a debugger.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">unregistered wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">Thanks cpow! <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /> Does the FCEUX debugger have those options? </div>
