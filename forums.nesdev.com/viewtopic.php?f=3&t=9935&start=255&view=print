At least <em>Action 53</em>, <em>DABG</em>, and <em>RHDE</em> are known to use a compression library that operates this way. How would your scheme handle this?

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I don't have any idea how to add HD support to those games yet. May be I'll add an option to select how to identify the tiles: PRG ROM address + tile data, PRG ROM address only or tile data only. Then those game will have to use the tile data only and ignore the PRG ROM address. This may cause problem if several different tiles have the same tile pattern and palette but this is the best I can come up with.

Because that is default NES behavior used in most games. In the parallax settings tab we will have a setting to determine the speed in which the background image scrolls when compared to the PPUSCROLL location as well as tell it which picture to load per screen similar to the music having to define one or more addresses for it to take effect. So if the address is 0D for example show this for the background and if it’s 1B then show this one if you’re clever you might use the same music addresses for this effect. Since the background color is actually blank and determined by the game itself no special green screen color replacement is needed. It will just draw the image instead of transparency and then draw the tiles on top. Multiple images can be used for the background to create multiple parallaxes each with their own separate speeds. Think Super Mario All-Stars. Like I said I don’t know how the frames are drawn but all it would need is a way to render the background image independent of the game and then draw the replaced game sprites and tiles over it.<br /><br />That's my idea.

So the scroll values inside the PPU alone is not enough to determine the real scroll value. The best bet is to find the scroll values directly from RAM and calculate the real scroll value with a formula. Both the formula and the RAM address will be game specific.

If they do then this may work.</div><br />Games use nametables and sprite attributes for static tile address, why something should be shifted? Yes, the same addresses can be downloaded new tiles, but the image data (in hex) will be different and it can be determined that it is a different tile. May be to slow compare all 16 bytes of tile data, then may use partially data or hash, checksum.

Both the formula and the RAM address will be game specific.</div><br />I see, well it was worth a shot. I just figured if the value went up in RAM then scroll right and if it went down scroll left. I didn't think about when it resets. I was looking at addresses $2005 and $2006 in Super Mario Bros 1 and $0022 and $0023 in Super Mario Bros 3. It would have been a cheat way to do it anyways probably.<br /><br />edit: so I figured out that $2005 in SMB is one pixel and $2006 is one 8 pixel block. So basically you just gotta count and keep track of it. Some kind of counter value that stays behind the scenes. And that would translate into 1 pixel on the PNG background file (which can loop or be as long as the level). Or if you set it 1 pixel per 2 hex values or whatever. 2 pixels per 1 hex etc. Then hopefully that would produce parallaxing. The lowest layer on the emulator would be an image viewer essentially that the emulator plays on top of. Anything marked transparent in the palette or transparent in the png would of course show the image on the bottom layer.<br /><br />edit 2: or maybe not. You guys know more about the system then I do.
