		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I'm having a bit of trouble getting CV3 working.  Currently, I know of two problems:
<br />
<br />1. The intro switches CHR pages too early.  i.e. it switches to the character pages for the next screen before it's finished with the current one.  I suspect this is IRQ related, but I'm not quite clear on when the IRQ triggers (it says based on scanline, but at what point in the scanline?  And is it scanlines since the value is set?)
<br />
<br />2. In the first level, the vertical scrolling portion is messed up.  It scrolls by tile instead of by pixel.  This one, I'm clueless about.
<br />
<br />Anyone happen to know the answers to any of these questions, or where to look?
<br />
<br />
<br />Thanks,
<br />
<br />
<br />Josh

<br />
<br />Turns out all you have to do is "add" a few cycles between the time you set the VBlank and execute an NMI. I believe you also have to update the V counters on cycle 252 (rather than on cycle 256) to get it working right.

<br />
<br />Yeah, I did change the V  counters to cycle 251 to get it working, I remember now (it's been a while).  But if I change it to 252 right now, it'll lock up when I'm almost through the level (like, right at the end it locks).  Oh well, 251 doesn't seem to be hurting anything (though I'm sure it is, somewhere).

<br />
<br />When the scroll regs are refreshed, don't you do "ppu_refresh += 0x1000" (meaning the fine-Y scroll)? Is this is done before pixel 256, a 1-line distortion will appear. I might post a screenshot of what I mean.

<br />
<br />In fact, I render the screen by taking the scroll regs immediately.

<br />
<br />- Increase X scroll every 4th cycle (4, 12, 20, 28, etc)
<br />- Increase Y scroll on cycle 252
<br />- Reset X scroll (LoopyV = (LoopyV &amp; 0x7BE0) | (LoopyT &amp; 0x041F); ) on cycle 256
<br />
<br />That with the delay after the 2002.7 flag is raised before an NMI is triggered... and Battletoads runs wonderfully.  No distortion in any games.. everything works great.
<br />
<br />
<br />If you're having distortion troubles, Fx3, it might be because you're not doing the pixel pipeline properly?  Remember that images are loaded 9-16 cycles before they're actually drawn to the screen.  So changing scroll values on 252 changes the scroll -after- all the tiles have been loaded... the remaining pixels being drawn to the screen on the scanline are already in memory.
