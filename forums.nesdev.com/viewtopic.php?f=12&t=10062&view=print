		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />hey guys,<br />Thought I'd share what I've been working on for a while now....<br />I've made this SRAM adapter that will work on almost all the FX boards.... this is what I use to have multiple save banks for different games (i.e Star fox 2, or Yoshi's island, etc..) which I use in conjunction with my Mulit-FX boards.  I have 2 Multi-Fx boards designs (not as cool as Ho-jo's though).   1st is just a 3 EPROM version that can have any of the FX games that are smaller than 8mbits.  Switch on the side selects the games.  The SRAM adapter keeps them all seperate.  For example, you could have a Star Fox trilogy on the Stunt Race host (seen top of pic).    The 2nd design can adapt Yoshi's Island into a 9 in 1 multi-Fx cartridge where All the FX games are in 1 cart.  and the pic at the bottom is DOOM that also uses the SRAM adapter for saves and can also utilize the &quot;rom board&quot; that can have all 9 FX games on it.... each with it's own save space.  I made the SRAM adapter so that it could be cut in half so it could be used on games, like stunt race, that already have a save circuit.  All the &quot;rom boards&quot; that connect to the FX cartridge are re-flashable in circuit with standard programmers. The adapters are &quot;edge Plated&quot; so it makes it a little easier to solder it in place of the SRAM that it replaces.    Geeze, this project has occupied way too much time and $$.  <br />These could be used for FX development for those who need to test on real hardware without having to unsolder the roms.<br /><br />Mark<br /><br /><br />EDIT: TOP PIC ---- I added pics of the &quot;rom boards&quot; which sit on the back side of the FX boards and can be removed to re-program if desired.

I was wondering if you ever had these multicart mods available for sale or you were modding carts for people? If so how much?<br /><br />Iv'e been waiting for an SD2SNES FX update but it seems as though it is still quite a ways off so having all FX games on one cart would be a nice alternative for time being.

And a way to program the roms of course.<br /><br />You will need 3 boards total to do the multi-FX conversion.  The Rom board, the adapter board (this board attaches to where the mask rom is and also connects to the Rom board).  The 3rd board is the SRAM replacement board.   These boards work BEST on Doom boards (SRAM mainly).  The yoshi's Island board is more difficult because yoshi island board uses 256k SRAM.  So for the &quot;multi-FX set up, games like StarFox2 and Winter Gold, Dirt Trax, and Stunt Race, these need 512k SRAM which will require you to run a jumper wire from 1 of the GSU pins (pin 104 I think... Not sure from my failing memory) to the SRAM adapter so the yoshi's Island host will be able to utilize the 512k SRAM.  See pic above &quot;close up of SRAM&quot; shows the jumper.  Doom doesn't need this jumper because it's already 512k.<br />The parts needed are all surface mount stuff except for the 40 pin right angle. <br /><br />Doom is the easier board host to use because you don't have to mess with attaching a wire to the GSU pins.<br /><br />My favorite aspect of this adapter set is that there are 6 different Yoshi's Island hacks and this adapter set will get 5 of the 6 on 1 board.  You can actually get all 6, but the 6th YI would have to share game 1's SRAM save bank.    But unless you <span style="text-decoration: underline">wanted</span> different save banks for the yoshi's Islands variants (requiring the SRAM adapter board but don't need to run jumper to the GSU), you can run all the yoshi's islands hacks with the original SRAM (not needing the SRAM adapter board).  The saves for YI are cross-able between the variants.    The &quot;kamek's Revenge&quot; YI version is really challenging but not crazy hard.  Very fun!<br /><br />Hope that makes sense......<br /><br /> PM me if you are still interested.  I'm sure we can work something out. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br /><br />Edit:  <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://youtu.be/Vmpn4pTsUPk">http://youtu.be/Vmpn4pTsUPk</a><!-- m -->
