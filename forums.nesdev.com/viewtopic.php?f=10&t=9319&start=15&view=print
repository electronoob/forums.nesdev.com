Better would be to rewire the cables so that you can connect the controllers externally (some of these signals may be shared with the expansion port), but including the bit2 of $4016 on the second controller port, so that you can use the microphone. And then you can add SELECT and START button on second controller as well, and including microphone too. Hopefully if you know how to build electronics hardware you could rewire the cables without too much difficulty.<br /><br />Especially if someone makes a Famicom clone hardware, they could do this; include both Famicom expansion port and the both controller ports including microphone! It is what I would do if I made a Famicom clone hardware: It is like the original Famicom, including the expansion port, both controller ports (including microphone), Famicom expansion port, and an internal ROM which can function when no cartridge is inserted (and could include a BASIC or Forth interpreter). And then, comes with it, connected externally: the keyboard, both controllers (including microphone), and 72-to-60 adapter.

I wouldn't say they are not compatible though, as a lot of official games accept input from such controllers. In fact, all licensed games I have personally looked at do read bit 1 as well as bit 0 (from really old games like Balloon Fight to newer ones like Kirby's Adventure). The only exceptions I remember are unlicensed Camerica games. This makes me think there was something about this in the official programming manuals.<br /><br />I'm not forcing you to change your way of reading controllers, I was just pointing something in case you didn't know (the available tutorials don't seem to mention these Famicom controllers). If you were already aware of this and are ignoring these Famicom controllers on purpose, that's your problem.

	<tr>
		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />The bottom line is that the built-in controller returns data on bit 0, and the expansion port controllers use bit 1. The actual method used to combine them varies from game to game. Some games read from $4016, store the value into a temp location, shift the accumulator right to line the bits up and OR them together, other games read from $4016, clear the top 6 bits and compare the result with #1: equal or more means that either one or both bits are set, so the carry flag can be used as a button state (I like this method better!). Anyway, the actual implementation doesn't matter, as long as you take both bits into consideration when reading $4016.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />There are a fair number of games that don't read bit 1 and 0. Mainly it's stuff developed in Europe or North America, since reading both bits isn't relevant on the NES. Battletoads and Solstice don't, off the top of my head. (I'd bet the Famicom port of Battletoads does read both though-- haven't checked.)
