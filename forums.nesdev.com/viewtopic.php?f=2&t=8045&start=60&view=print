A space, not a colon, denotes a label's end.<br />2. Anything other than a label MUST have whitespace before it on the line.<br /><br />For example, <tt style="margin-left: 2px; margin-right: 2px; padding:3px; background-color: #3355aa; color: white;">.db</tt> is an instruction and <tt style="margin-left: 2px; margin-right: 2px; padding:3px; background-color: #3355aa; color: white;">.db 12,34</tt> at the start of a line thus violates 2.<br /><br />Newer assemblers use a colon to distinguish a label from an instruction.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Thank you very much for the feedback. I am very pleased that this project was useful to someone else !<br />I shall do the improvements you mention when I get the time to do it. Most of them sound pretty simple.<br /><br />The reason the .db parser is so picky is because I coded it all by myself and I didn't know too much how to do it so I coded something randomly that worked for typcial cases and didn't bother to stress test it.<br />I think a comma without a white space should definitely be acceptable, and I don't know why there is an error when you use Foo2. Perhaps &quot;foo&quot; is already defined, and I replace it by it's address before it's followed by a 2 which makes no sense ?

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />OK I've made several of the changes you suggested, and have at least semi-valid reasons not to have changed the others :<br /><br />- Now all labels are followed by : in outputs files. Which will create weird labels ending with :: if you try to chain algorithm, but at least it will be visible that you chained algorithms that way.<br />- You can compress using only a single algorithm with the &quot;fix algorithm&quot; -fa option, followed by the number of the algorithm you want to use. I know numbers suck, but I wanted to keep it generic, that way any algorithms can be removed or added in a completely generic way. Calling them by name would have been possible but I'm lazy. In another version pehaps.<br />- You can force the output to the file you desire with the -o option. It's recommended to use this alongside with -fa, else you'd end up with a single file compressed with the last algorithm, each algorithm overwriting output from the previous one.<br />- You can change .db into .byte and .dw with .word with the -byte option<br /><br />Now what way NOT changed :<br />- .db is still picky about the format. The reason is that if I replaced commas with white spaces, and threat white spaces as separators, then .db 12 34 would have been the same as .db 12, 34 which is a problem. I'd have to put some trought to fix this problem so I can't do it on just a quick fix. For a future version maybe.<br /><br />- I have no idea what is causing the foo2 bug. I'd have to investigate this and release a fix<br /><br />- Minmax is still defined as data. The reason for this is that I really do a one to one compression, I compress a List&lt;List&lt;Byte&gt;&gt; into another List&lt;List&lt;Byte&gt;&gt;, both with associated labels. If I had to make the difference between parameters and data, it would not be a one to one compression, and things would not be as generic as they are now (i.e. some coding and decoding algorithm would need more parameters than just a List&lt;List&lt;Byte&gt;&gt; to work, which I did not want to have because they could not expand the same Enoding interface if this were to happen).<br /><br />The update is temporarly available at <a href="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/23465629/other_junk/CompressTools.7z" class="postlink">Dropbox</a>, and will be released on Romhacking.net very soon.<br /><br />I hope this will be useful to everyone, and I am looking forward to other feedback in order to improve this tool.

Also this happens if the input file has labels ending with &quot;:&quot; in them. So I think you should at least strip the &quot;:&quot; from the end of labels read by the mini assembler, or simply (as a quick fix) strip all extra &quot;:&quot; from end of a label when outputting them.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">- You can compress using only a single algorithm with the &quot;fix algorithm&quot; -fa option, followed by the number of the algorithm you want to use.

&nbsp; ----------------------- ----------------------- --------------&nbsp; ------</div><br /><br />Deflate is provided for curiosity only. Like RAM_LZ77, it is way too complex to be implemented on NES.<br />Tokumaru crashed for 32-byte files, and failed to work for the 1016-byte file. Increasing the size to 1024 produced the result of 559 bytes. It also complained that the 74 kilobyte VRAM file contained too many tiles, but hacking the source code increasing the limit from 512 tiles to 10000 tiles produced a successful compression (don't know if it is decompressable).<br />pucrunch includes a decompressor in each data, and thus has a large starting cost.<br /><br />From the CompressTools selection, there were quite a few codecs that failed to apply to one or more files, and as such they cannot be said to be general-purpose. And EscapeRLE got a &quot;verify error&quot; for files 0 and 1 (harmless, as the data was valid).<br /><br />The compression methods marked with a mere version number (1.3.8 and 2.3.1) stand for the compression method I wrote myself for Simon's Quest. Turns out it is not too bad a general-purpose compressor, though it is mostly oriented for compression of nametables. I also profiled it for the game's VROM data (with duplicate tiles removed), and it achieved a performance somewhere between ROM_LZ77 and RAM_LZ77.<br /><br />The compression format, basically RLE with tweaks, is documented below:<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ; LIT: Input byte c = 0..3F:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Put next (c+0x01) bytes verbatim, except BACKWARDS<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ; END: Input byte c = 40:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; End stream<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ; SEQ: Input byte c = 41..7F:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Read byte b<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Put b, (c-0x3F) times; add 1 to b after each iteration<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ; DBL: Input byte c = 80..9F:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Read byte b1<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Read byte b2<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Put b1, (c-0x7D) times; swap b2 and b1 after each iteration<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ; RUN: Input byte c = A0..FF:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Read byte b<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Put b, (0x101-c) times</div><br />The earlier version was almost the same, except RUN was 80..FF and DBL did not exist.<br />You can find the source code to the decompressor for the 1.3.8 version <a href="http://bisqwit.iki.fi/src/nes-ppu_rleinc.inc" class="postlink">here</a>. It assembles into 92 bytes, and uses 4 bytes from zeropage for parameters. It decompresses directly into PPU's $2007 port.<br />The 2.3.1 version can be found <a href="http://bisqwit.iki.fi/src/nes-ppu_rleinc_v2.inc" class="postlink">here</a>. It assembles into 123 bytes.<br />You can find an example compressor here: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://bisqwit.iki.fi/src/nes-ppu_rleinc_compress.php.txt">http://bisqwit.iki.fi/src/nes-ppu_rlein ... ss.php.txt</a><!-- m --><br /><br />If you wish to perform independent tests, you can download the files I used for testing <a href="http://bisqwit.iki.fi/cv2fin/dev/compressor_tests.zip" class="postlink">here</a>.

APLIB is fast for decompressing, since it uses a nice trick where 8-bit values are always byte aligned.  Obviously not as fast as RLE, but still good.<br /><br />APLIB is one of the best I've seen that has very low system requirements to decompress.<br /><br />Also test out &quot;<a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/viewtopic.php?p=54230" class="postlink">tokumaru_tile_compression</a>&quot; for graphics.

I'm not sure how efficient it would be to rewrite it for 6502 though. The decompressor is neat and nice in 8086 assembler, but...<br />And I'll see about Tokumaru's project, as well. Thanks for the suggestion.<br /><br />EDIT: Added Tokumaru.<br />APLIB's algorithm (which is LZ-based by the way) is a bit of trouble due to its thousands of options, and the fact that the choice of those options very much determines how large the decompressor will be. My COM file packer tests those options in conjuction with the decompressor size and chooses the smallest combination. Oh, and LZ-based are trouble for 6502 in general.<br />(Disclaimer: My knowledge of APLIB comes almost entirely through reverse engineering the executable compressor of aPACK.)

Removing the one extends the range of the special short-offset copy by one byte.<br />- Whether all literals are stored in a separate table, and literals in actual data are encoded as gamma offsets to that table.

However :<br />1) the codec is likely to work very poorly with only 8-bit references<br />2) In order to decode block N you have to decode blocks 0, 1, .... upto N, so if N is large it can be very time consuming.
