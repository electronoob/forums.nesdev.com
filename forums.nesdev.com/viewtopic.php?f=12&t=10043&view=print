How ever i really like the game and played it on emulator.<br /><br />And now just a few days ago i found out it was ppl that made it on cartridge.<br /><br />Since i love to learn new things and also like development i was thinking about to make this.<br /><br />But i got some questions.<br /><br />Can i take an old SNES game and take out the pieces and some how delete everything on it and make it &quot;empty&quot; so i can put parallel worlds on it?<br /><br />How do i code in this?<br /><br />i found out this post already <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/viewtopic.php?f=12&amp;t=8177&amp;hilit=parallel+worlds" class="postlink">Parallel worlds</a><br /><br />But it doesnt help me that much.<br /><br />Is there any newbie tutorials on how to put ROMS on cartridge?<br /><br />And also, im doing this for SNES PAL version.<br /><br />Thx <br />Orvars

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Find a donor cart, sports came or cheap SFC games are great.<br /><br />I'm not exactly sure how SNES works, but I think you need the donor cart to be the same kind of rom LTTP is (Hi-Rom or Lo-rom).  Desolder the mask rom from the cart, flash an eeprom or flash memory with the rom hack, and then solder the eeprom/flash mem to the cart.  IIRC eeproms use a different pinout than Nintendo's mask roms and you have to do a lot of spaghetti wiring to get the pinout correct, or buy a dip adaptor.<br /><br />I dont know much about this and I may be incorrect on a few things, but that's the gist of it.

Its expensive if you dont already have access to a soldering iron, desoldering iron/bulb, solder, programmer, Gamebit (to open the cart) or needle-nose pliers, ROM chips (if you use the 8M variety, you will need 2 of them), label paper and know-how. It would be a lot cheaper for you to just get someone who already makes repros to make it. It'll cost you $45 for it, versus ~$200 for all the parts required to build &quot;just one&quot; game.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />A minimum cost would be the Super Everdrive, which is about $80 on Retrogate.<br /><br />The cost of doing reproductions can be mitigated by buying your EPROMs from a provider that will program them for you. This will save you $80-$100 on the cost of a programmer if you're only doing a few carts.<br /><br />You will need a donor cart that matches the specs of the game, so for Parallel Worlds,  NBA Live 95 is recommended, since it has room for 2 EPROMs.<br /><br />When looking for a donor, you're looking to match wether the game is HiROM or LoROM, and that the donor has the same amount of SRAM or more than the game needs.<br /><br />You'll need to run the game ROM through a program called Wasabi to remap it so it works properly, too.<br />I think there's some other rewiring needed to be done as well. Not sure, since I've never done a PW repro.<br /><br />Oh, and you'll obviously need soldering and desoldering supplies.<br />Removing through-hole connections like these ROM chips is frustrating without a proper desoldering iron and pump, so that's a minimum investment of $30-$50.<br />You'll also likely need flux to solder wires on. Unless you can get a third hand to hold the wires for you and apply solder directly, you'll need to flux the wire and pin, tin your iron, and transfer the solder, which is frustrating without flux.<br /><br />You'll actually need wire to work with too. An old IDE ribbon cable stripped into individual strands works well enough.
