I theorized that the $3x colors would overshoot when the signal was low-pass filtered to the ~6MHz video bandwidth), but when I ran my NES back at full-speed and digitized the waveform, I didn't see any overshoot. So it seems your idea of using the unadjusted chroma square wave amplitudes directly is correct, and my idea of scaling them by 1.27 is not.

<br />
<br />So what prevents us from having "perfect" NES video as God intended? 
<br />1. Different filter. Again, real TVs likely don't use a two-way Gaussian blur. I dabbled with a real low-pass filter in the spatial domain, but didn't get it to work right. Also, low-pass filters create these "ringing" artifacts which I have never seen on a real TV...
<br />
<br />2. Non-standard, Japanese 80s' chroma decoder. We'd need a Japanese 80s' TV, identify the electronics responsible for chroma decoding and measure the output given a certain input. Got one? Know how to get one? <img src="./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" />

Did you look at the <a href="http://www.jwz.org/xscreensaver/" class="postlink">analogtv module in the XScreenSaver package</a>? I still haven't tried the code, but it has what I consider the "next level" features. One thing it does is work at many times the NTSC rate. I kind of want to do that for the NES PPU; generate a signal at the ~21.5 MHz rate the PPU phase counter runs at, then resample that. This way you generate the actual NES video waveform with no use of sin(). I just calculated and realized that we're already running at 14.32 MHz, so bumping up to 21.5 MHz is only a 50% increase.
<br />
<br />I'm still unclear on the horizontal pixel correspondence. Color burst is at 3.58 MHz, and the I and Q components are 90 degress out of phase, so it takes a sample rate 4x that, 14.32 MHz. NES pixels run at 5.37 MHz, so each pixel lasts for 2.66667 samples. Then you're saying that you take this 752-sample signal, convert it to RGB at the same sample rate, then interpolate down to 640 or something close to that? I think I get it now. What was throwing me off is that I thought that you output the 720 raw, because I thought, why else would you expand to 720 if it wasn't supposed to be that wide? But that expansion is in the raw signal domain, necessary to achieve a sufficient sampling rate.
<br />
<br />We really need some quality control. I know I've contributed to it, but we'll have all these emulators based to varying degrees on the latest findings in this area, with people thinking NTSC NES emulation has been reached (it hasn't) and saying we failed (even though we're not done). That's one reason posting RGB palettes is premature (or even inappropriate, since NTSC NES emulation is not about choosing the correct palette).

<br />It depends on how the TV user has set the "color" knob. It could be at 1.0, or it could be at 1.27.
<br />
<br />A color TV has five knobs, with the following effects on signal processing: <ul><li>Brightness - luma DC offset </li><li>Contrast - signal gain </li><li>Sharpness - luma high-boost filter gain </li><li>Color - chroma gain </li><li>Tint - chroma phase offset </li></ul>

<br />
<br />I added a wiki page with a summary of my results so far (included color emphasis), along with a nice little C program that implements the algorithm and displays the waveform on screen using SDL, with mouse control of PPU phase and color. I still need to work out which direction the phases go (left or right), though this is a very minor issue.
<br />

<br />
<br /><a href="http://www.io.com/~greens/temp/nes_ntsc_waveform.c" class="postlink">nes_ntsc_waveform.c</a>
<br />
<br />Here's a snapshot, showing the kind of waveform you get from the demo with emphasis bits set:
<br />
<br /><img src="http://www.io.com/~greens/temp/ntsc_waveform_emu.png" alt="Image" />
<br />
<br />If anyone compiles the SDL demo on a PC, post the executable here or to the Wiki so others can get a hands-on experience with the NES video signal.

<br />
<br />Also, a way to translate those emphasis bits to luma/chroma adjustments on each palette entry would be nice (rather than having to average them across the 4 cycles in each pixel, from what it looks like).

<br />
<br />I haven't even investigated the effect of the emphasis bits on the final pixel colors, just the raw waveform (and I still need to re-check it, since it was hard to discern such fine detail). The names were copied from a random NES PPU register reference, and shouldn't have been taken as descriptive of behavior. I'm working on a new NTSC emulation algorithm from scratch that will use the raw NES video waveform at the full ~21.5 MHz. From that I should be able to get some good values. For now I'm just presenting the raw data in as concise a form as possible. By doing that anyone can derive conclucions and calculations from it. I'm kind of hoping there will be some collaboration in the project.
<br />
<br />EDIT: I probably should have just left naming out of it, since the page's only purpose was describing the waveform that results. What do the names mean, anyway? My findings show that the bits don't even emphasize the colors, so the <em>proper</em> name would be color <em>attenuation</em> bits or really, chroma modulation bits, since they impose another waveform on the normal waveform. Also note that the screenshot from the demo above outputs four pixels in a row for each color value. Outputting just one wouldn't capture an entire cycle of the color waveform (which is why isolated pixels of a particular palette index don't appear the normal color of a run of pixels).
<br />
<br />Based on all the "give me the RGB values!" requests I'd rather not post progress. Where are the people who enjoy reverse-engineering for its own sake, to finally understand exactly what's going on, who aren't just in it for scoring points with emulation accuracy? Maybe like Nesticle, "teh ULTIMATE NES .pal" is an issue that makes people crazy.

<br />
<br />Most of them probably don't understand (or care) how NTSC works in the first place.
<br />
<br />Besides, I don't want the straight RGB values, since those wouldn't take hue/saturation into account. The entire GOAL of my emulator is to be as accurate as possible, and this is one part of it. I do not, however, plan to emulate an NTSC (or PAL) television within my emulator, mainly because it would then require a Beowulf cluster (imagine it!) to run at maximum speed.

<br />
<br />Personally, I find this discussion to be fascinating, and I'd like to see more. I think the best way for an emulator to handle this would be to give the user an option between either "realistic" NTSC output or "perfect" RGB output. One thing, though: The current NTSC screenshots I've seen, while impressive, tend to have a bit more artifacting than I remember actually seeing. They look like a really *bad* TV set. I used to play the NES on a composite monitor (Commodore 1702) and even though this was composite and must therefore have had some color bleed and so forth, it was nowhere near as blurred as some of the NTSC emulated screenshots. Am I misremembering? (I still have that monitor in the basement so I suppose I could dig it out and try it.)

<br />
<br />You're correct; the NTSC emulation code I've posted (and which Nestopia is based on) is poor, mostly due to the lossy optimizations I made to bring it from 2 frames per second to 50. I want to do a lot better and allow adjustment of the amount of artifacts.

<br />That's just creepy.  I have a 1702 sitting <em>right next to my monitor with my NES plugged into it</em>.  Its a part of my workstation.  Sometimes, I run it side-by-side with an emulator just to see what the major differences are.  
<br />
<br />I'll have to agree, the current state of emulation is more akin to a badly calibrated TV - but I kind of like that effect.  It has a "playing games in your friend's basement on a crappy set" kind of charm to it.

The NES' artifacting works in such a way that the artifacts will (appear to) cancel each other out over several fields. That's why a still screenshot will always appear to have more artifacts than the real thing. Just look at the video-captured screenshots on MobyGames.<br />You need to compare a real NES to an emulator running NTSC artifacting (running at full speed with perfect vertical synchronization), not to a screenshot. Of course, the emulator should implement the artifacting correctly, which Nestopia 1.25 doesn't.<br /><br />That's also the reason why I think getting the video levels right is more important than the artifacting. With the proper video levels, the user can choose a virtual TV's hue/saturation/decoder coefficients and thus create his own, subjectively perfect RGB palette to match his taste or home TV. That goal has already been achieved! (Though I think there are some rounding errors in blargg's values. I'll check again later using the original waveform he posted. Also, I think it would be proper to convert those values to voltage levels, or even better, IRE levels; since the voltages for Sync and Blanking are defined, it should be possible to get the voltages even from blargg's normalized waveform.)<br /><br />Artifacting again will only work properly if your emulator has perfect "vsync", an option unavailable to many people because many monitors don't run at 60 Hz, at least not in their default settings, and I also consider it negligible to the average user, although certainly exciting to explore and emulate. (From that point of view, I also think we shouldn't be satisfied with those measured level values, but instead try to find out how exactly they come about, with reference to the "resistor ladder" described in the NES' patent.)<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">blargg wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">What I really want to do is run the output to a high-speed D/A convertor, resulting in a real composite video output from the PC that exactly matches the NES output.</div>I've got a feeling that after resampling/filtering, you'll end up with the same result as my original algorithm (with the correct levels, of course).
