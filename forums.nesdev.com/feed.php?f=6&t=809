Sounds like it'd work fine, one way would be with a cart like Squeedo that has a serial port you could send init/play signals to the PC and have the actual PC do the sound stuff there.  I thought about that before.  It would possibly work with a controller port to RS232 adapter also, but controller reads can mess it up (from toggling the strobe output shared by both ports).<br /><br />If you want the sound coming out of the actual NES, then of course that's something else (and the system would need to be modified).

If you're working on upgrading an NES game to a more PC level, I'd suggest making tiles 16x16 pixels and 16 colors, with color 0 as transparent (as before). Then, given that each of the 8 palettes in the NES is 3 colors, and each color is 6 bits, associate these 18 bits with a 16-color palette using a hash table.<br /><br />It won't easily work with U*ROM games or A*ROM games or SNROM games or any other game with VRAM unless you hash the tile data itself, and that can get slow.<br /><br /><strong>For sound:</strong><br />CPU$3000-$3FFF might be a good place to put emulator-specific registers. This would act "normally" (that is, as a mirror of $2000-$2007) until the program unlocks it by writing a sequence of bytes to $3000 with the "slave PPU" bit set (which no commercial games use).<br /><br />But in more of the spirit of emulating hardware that could actually be implemented, this could be designed as a Famicom sound chip, which would occupy a 256-byte area outside what other mappers use. Games would need to be trained (e.g. IPS) to use the extra sounds, and it would need a separate sample bank (.wav, .ogg, etc) which could be included in a zipfile (MAME style) or in a folder or even as a new chunk type in UNIF or iNES+UNIF.<br /><br />$43x0 write: Control (enable, looping)<br />$43x1 read: Status (finished, stopped, etc)<br />$43x2-3 write: Sample number to play when this sample finishes<br />$43x4-5 Playback rate<br />$43x6 Left channel volume<br />$43x7 Right channel volume<br />$43x8-$43xF Reserved<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=9">tepples</a> — Wed Dec 07, 2005 9:37 pm</p><hr />

*gives you a beer*<br /><br />Anyway, since it seems like you're triggering this through read/writes... just be sure to designate an unused area so it doesn't conflict with mapper register writes or NES system registers.  Unfortunately, mappers are known to occupy most of the available space (N106 takes all of $4800-FFFF)<br /><br />I think your best best would be around $46xx... I don't think anything uses that area, and it doesn't mirror to anything either.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=33">Disch</a> — Wed Dec 07, 2005 7:45 pm</p><hr />
