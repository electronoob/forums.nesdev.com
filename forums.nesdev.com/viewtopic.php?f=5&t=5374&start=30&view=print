<br />Oh my god this is SO horrible ! Also wasting 80% of the SPC's memory for a "get ready" sample and placing crap instrument and having crap instrument in the remaining 20% is probably a very bad decision. (I just make the number up, but it looks like that's pretty much what the game does).

<br />If it weren't boring, then it wouldn't have an extra layer or two put on top in Bomberman 2.

<br />The Japanese version, Bombuzal, had worse insturments, and worse vocal quality in my opinon.
<br />
<br />I'd like to nominate the Storyline theme for Bronkie as one of the worst boss themes I have heard (it IS played as a boss theme, but it is also used for the storyline)... mainly because it's not epic.
<br />
<br />Some of War 2410's music was bad. In my opinion, three of the player turn pieces of music were bad, and when you get a promotion or Campaign Medal, that piece of music that plays isn't a good thing either. Blame the composers for this... I've got two of them with my crosshairs.
<br />
<br />War 3010 to me was an improvement over War 2410 music-wise, but I do remember one of the tunes developing synching problems.
<br />
<br />And let's not forget the infamous Revolution X... looping musical samples galore! Well, execpt for one tune. But that one tune has volume problems. That would be KemmyTech Factory.
<br />
<br />Astrohawk May 2003 Version, a PD game, had terrible synching with some of its tunes. You can hear all seven of them (as far as I know) by simply utilzing the map screen.
<br />
<br />I give Eien no Filena my worst RPG music award. To me, the one thing that is the worst thing about the music is that it has some bad notation.
<br />
<br />Go Go Dodge League had at least one bad piece of music. When you start up the Mebio Cup, there's a piece of music that plays. In my opinion, the music has bad notation.
<br />
<br />Some of the national anthems for International Tennis Tour were terribly executed, with notes getting cut off a split second later after being played. That to me is poor execution.
<br />
<br />PGA Tour '96's Title Screen music isn't too well done either.
<br />
<br />Pro Mahjong Tsuwamono's Main Menu music has some foul notation as well.
