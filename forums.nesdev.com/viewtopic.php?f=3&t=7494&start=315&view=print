<br />This is why an XML type approach would be better for preservation, that info can be added as needed without breaking all existing ROMs.  Things like PCB scans could be added to the same ZIP with the file name in the XML instead of locking down the ZIP to not allow any other files.  
<br />
<br />Instead you just say its too hard, so ignore it all?  Even though bootgod's site is already doing much of it?  So much for wanting real preservation.  Good job ignoring all the other problems too.

<br />
<br />
<br />The first ones are created by emulators, and it's the standard. See the iNES standard set in what seems to be <strong>1998</strong>. It's been modified since then slightly for the very few games that did't work and weren't known to exist, but that has since been fixed, sorry.
<br />

<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />And also, should ALL PRG-ROM's be at least 32KB big since in games that are only 8K/16K make the whole data range just mirror? Game might be 8K, but that doesn't mean the game program uses the last 8K or the first 8K to run. So it technically is all needed.

<br />
<br /><ol style="list-style-type: decimal"><li>Fitzroy is concerned with preserving the exact details of dumped game ROMs.  He champions the "ZapFC" format for this.</li><li>Most of #nesdev is concerned with making game images (homebrew, commercial, pirate, anything) playable in emulators and on real hardware.  We champion iNES (1 or 2) or sometimes UNIF.</li><li>Arcade emulation, which due to the huge variability in system board, must preserve exact ROMs and uses databases that tell the emulator how each of the CPUs in the arcade use each ROM, where it is mapped, which buses connect to which and so forth.  Here emulation requires exact preservation. (Please correct me if I'm wrong on this.  The only things that I know about MAME and the like I gleaned from this thread).</li></ol>
<br />
<br />Fitzroy stated that his big concern is archiving accurate ROM dumps.  ROM dumps that he probably can't openly share with the world for legal reasons.  I'm willing to bet that the VAST majority of users of NES ROMs are to play games in emulators, not as digital historians.  Those users don't really care how it is packaged, so long as the EMU is able to play the game properly.
<br />
<br />I don't know how many "official" NES games there are.  I thought that there were 760 or so released in the US market (based on unique prog-roms or titles that use the US region's lockout chip), and a few hundred more that were only released in Japan, Europe or the rest of the world.  So I'm going to pull a number out of my ass and guess that not counting hacks or homebrew, there are less than 2000 unique NES titles.  There are a handful of solid emulators that are actively maintained and work reasonably well.  <strong>If these emulators can successful play the entire corpus of "official" games, then the iNES format is sufficient for emulation.</strong>
<br />
<br />It doesn't matter if you dump a game to iNES or ZapFC or MAME format.  People can't use the ROM until they obtain it from you.  If your goal is to archive perfect images of games ot prevent against bit-rot or just history taking its toll, you'll have to store copies in lots of places and ensure that a legacy of maintenance follows behind you.  <strong>I just don't see that happening effectively enough to be viable, at least in Japan or any western-civilization type country, due t the insane copyright laws that we tend to have.</strong>
<br />
<br />If the ZapFC format were agreed upon and adopted, consumers of ROMs archived in that format still need to obtain the ROMs, most likely through technically illegal means.  This is no different that using FCEUX and dumps in the iNES format.  
<br />
<br />It is obvious that ZapFC will not replace iNES.  Let those who want to archive ROMs exactly do so, with whatever format they want.  Why is it so important to crusade against the established format, when it works well enough?  Can't we just have both (or three if MAME does something unique)?

<br />
<br />Huh? A garbage board file will make a licensed rom fail completely to load. And I never said board files for inifinite games wouldn't suffer the same rom-side problems as iNES. That's an inherent problem for that material, you can't improve upon it.
<br />
<br />It's an extra feature to support for people who believe in its benefits, it's not going to "replace" the Lady Gaga of rom formats. If you can't stop interjecting with fud statements, it's because you're ridiculously insecure about iNES. What I'm saying isn't rocket science. This is just a way of using a standard container that can be opened by standard programs with licensed mapping delivered by a trusted source. That's all it is. Woe be the emulators that ever support it. Woe be to them. How about letting the worthless, pointless, woeful format be discussed without further interruption from iNES groupies?

<br />
<br />Yeah we can have all of the above. I don't think Fitz honestly expects to "REIGN SUPREME LOLZ" I think he's just got a persistant personality, and wants people to know what he has to offer. Is it perfect? no. is it progress? yes.
<br />
<br />Do most average users care? no. Do I care what other people care? no.
<br />
<br />This is clearly for the enthusiast, but if the enthusiast does the heavy lifting, it may make it easier for the people who don't care later down the road for random game X.
<br />
<br />Finally, there are plenty of things that work well enough but leave plenty of room for improvemnent. What I don't understand is the negative reaction to improvement.
<br />
<br />Even if you don't believe it to be improvement, what is the big deal? The only reason I can think people might be upset about it, instead of indifferent, is if they actually think it might take off a little, and become a problem for them.
<br />
<br />Who knows.

<br />
<br />My statement was about iNES being good enough for <strong>emulators</strong>, not for reproducing carts.  To repro a cart, you would _WANT_ something like Fitzroy is proposing.  Its not an either this or that mutually exclusive choice.
<br />
<br />My main point was that we can have both, as they serve different needs, different audiences.

<br />
<br />I agree it doesn't have to be one or the other. I personally tend to lean towards the other side but to each their own I suppose.
<br />
<br />I knew you weren't saying anything about reproducing carts. That was kind of my point. It's my inclination to pick something that is robust enough to do many things, and then try to encourage adoption of it so that when it's needed, it's widely available enough to be easy to get and use. Does this mean it needs to dominate? no. Just be prevelant enough that people are familiar with it.
<br />
<br />Here is a question. Assuming homebrew developers can use this even if they dont' get added to the database. How does this hurt end users? if an end user can use a more robust format that can be helpful in other arenas, and he's none the wise, how does this hurt him? All that would be needed is support by NES emulator authors and it would be like nothing happened to the end user. No pain, no problem.
<br />
<br />ultimately though I don't think this is aimed at the end user primarily, but more at dumpers, devs, etc. and having end users use it would just be a bonus that gives devs an additional reason to work with it.
