<br />In "protection mode", the dump work on Nestopia

<br />My question to Martin is: does that data added/changed in "protecion mode" exist on the real disk (with word "DUMMY") or not ??
<br />
<br />Thank you.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Well, I'm not Marty, but I can answer your question - yes, that "DUMMY" is on the real disk.  It is a form of copy protection.
<br />
<br />At the beginning of each disk/side, there is a file counter that indicates how many files are on the disk (that is the first byte your hex editor found to be different).  This game (among others) had this byte set to the wrong value, making it seem like there are fewer files on disk than there really are.  If a copier/dumper relies on this byte to determine how many files to read, it will fail to copy all the data on the disk.
<br />
<br />When you start the game, it changes (temporarily) the file counter to indicate the correct number of files.  It then scans the disk in an attempt to find the hidden file (in this case, the file is named "DUMMY").  If the file cannot be found, then the game concludes that it must have been copied illegally and will refuse to proceed as a result.

<br />Thank You!
<br />So if I understand everything the correct value at the begining is 0x0D and not 0x0E (as in the "protection mode" dump)
<br />it changes to 0x0E only in memory while the game is running?

<br />
<br />0x0D is the proper file count and should have been changed back manually from 0x0E after the game was copied. 
<br />
<br />The game will know how many files are really on the disk and not need the header value.

<br />Please confirm if the real value in the disk is indeed 0x0d and not 0x0e (which I believe you did confirm indirectly but a direct confirmation is still better).

<br />
<br />If the game's original file count was 0x0D (13 decimal), but there are really 0x0E (14 decimal) files, early copy software which looked at the FDS header for a file count would only copy the first 13 files; it would not copy the last file  (14) because the software would stop after 13. It would assume the rest of the disk is garbage left over from the last game that was on the disk. As a form of protection, the game program itself may scan to the 14th file's location to check whether it's present. If it isn't, the game would know that the disk was illegally copied. If somebody changed the file count to represent the true number in order to copy that 14th file, the game could also detect that the file count was changed from the original 0x0D and presume it was illegally copied.
