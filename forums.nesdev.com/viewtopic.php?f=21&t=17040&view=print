Q: is it nesscesary for me to include the 'reversed', 'flipped' tiles in the set? or are those something that is programmed in on load up?, what is the preference that you prefer?<br /><br />thanks in advance for your answers. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />

So am i right in thinking that if i create art through YY-CHR or NES SCREEN TOOL, then that is a useable format to use in homebrew development, or is there something else i need to do, or another software altogether? <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />

As for yy-chr, the one program I use the most, there's only one thing I noticed that you can do on it that is not compatible with NES: you can set multiple background colors. On the NES you can have only 1 and it repeats accross the sub-palettes. Other than that, it's fine too, as long as you keep it under 2BPP NES on the &quot;Graphics format&quot; dropdown menu. But it's the default settings anyway.<br /><br />I think that if you're doing original artwork, NES Screen Tool should be better than yy-chr. I mostly do rom hacking, so I prefer yy-chr.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Thats great, i really appreciate your responses. i have played around with YY_CHR, i intend do have a play with NES SCREEN TOOL over the weekend. In terms of artwork i will just make tile sets and sprites that would be quite minuim really, 1 at a time. 1 background with tiles for whatever enviroment, and sprite sheet with a character and animations and release them that way, then the communitys can do as they want with them, make them better, or taylor them to there needs with there own rom set up and what not. thank you.

It also has a dedicated meta sprite tool whose interface takes a while getting used to, but once you do, it's pretty versatile.<br /><br />The only thing yy-chr does better (imo &amp; for this particular purpose) is using a global clipboard, which means you can cut, copy and paste contents between several editor instances. In NESST, you need to use save/load/import/export tools, which can be unweildy at times and takes time to adapt to.<br /><br /><br />YY-CHR is also good in the sense that you can modify assets embedded in compiled/assembled software with a visual interface, like some more able hex editors might be able to do, so it is ideal for ROM hacking, like nesrocks wrote.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />You can also see tiles in context in yy-chr, there's a bg editor for that.<br /><br />One neat trick when editting existing game's graphics is you dump the PPU memory on fceux, then you split the file using <a href="https://chipmusic.org/forums/topic/2080/glitchnes-02/" class="postlink">PPU Split</a>. It will generate a few files, one of them is a nam you can load on yy-chr's bg editor, so you can see tiles neatly arranged and edit more easily. On yy-chr you can simply open ROMS, but on NST you need to open CHR files. Which is why yy-chr is more confortable for rom hacking, to me. But NST has a few advantages that yy-chr lacks, such as placing multiple CHR tiles at once on the NAM by selecting a rectangle (this is a hugeeee help), import/export options, etc.

Load the .nam individually from the nametable drop-down; leaving your current tileset intact.

YY-CHR doesnt do that, it allows me to just draw with what ever colour i choose,(keeping within the limitation of coarse) <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />

And if you are creating the artwork yourself, you don't need to split PPU memory, you should have the nam you created. The technique is for editting existing games which you don't own the source files to.<br /><br />@Chasersgaming: what do you mean by the colors problem on NESST?

Don't focus on what colours the tileset appears to have in the tile window - focus on what it looks like when you've placed it on the nametable field. This is where you assign which palette to use for backgrounds - this is called the attribute table. You can view the attribute table by toggling the &quot;attribute&quot; toggle switch. <br /><br />For sprites, it works a little different, but principially the same. Tiles don't have colour - colours are assigned on a per-sprite basis.
