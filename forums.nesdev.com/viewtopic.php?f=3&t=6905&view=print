I know that's up for debate since there are a lot of factors, but I'm talking about the most basic features. And maybe some corner cutting if necessary.

<br />That depends on the target platform's display model. PocketNES runs on the 16.8 MHz ARM7 in a Game Boy Advance, but it helps that the GBA PPU has a video mode to which the NES PPU's display model maps fairly nicely. The GBA CPU emulates the NES CPU, the mapper chip, and about 10% of the NES PPU and APU, and the GBA PPU and APU emulate the rest.

<br />Do you think 50 or 100MHz is feasible to get one running at full speed?

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I had Nesticle running on a Intel 486 based CPU PC (yeah that one with awful FM MIDI sound), that was already obsolete in the early 2000 years (I was an early teenager).
<br />I don't remember the speed of the CPU, but I know that PC was made in 1994, and that was a very high-end one back then (probably why it was still functional working in the early 2000 years !). I had it working again last year when I was taking the opportunity that I bought a notebok to definitely got rid of all old desktop PCs of the house, and of course I tried Nesticle on it for nostalgia. It was a bit lagging.
<br />Too bad I don't remember the CPU speed, but the PC has 16 MB RAM, and the CPU on it was probably one of the best available in the year 1994.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I had an IBM PS/1, quite a strange PC (had a ROM with IBM-DOS 4.0, and microchannel bus).  It had a 386sx, but I don't know what speed.  I remember NESticle was running at about half frame-rate.  Tweaking the CPU emulation settings it seemed like it would run a little faster (and break certain games too, of course).  NESA was an earlier emulator, the first one I had tried.  I never got to try iNES because I didn't have win95.
<br />
<br />And really when it comes to 'slowest hardware', the clock speed doesn't matter much because hardware in general can do a huge variety of things on one particular clock cycle.  I don't know if you mean PCs specifically.  But I think probably the slowest system that can emulate the NES would be the SNES, because it's extremely well-suited to it.  It would be more like a re-compiling emulator, rather than a 100% software approach.  Cutting corners. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />

<br />
<br />Back in 1996 I found a NES emulator for DOS.  It was very small, and could play metroid just fine on a 486 33MHz.  The emulator did not support any sound though.  I no longer have it though, nor do I remember who wrote it.
<br />
<br />Some vague memory ...  Seems like I remember it being written by someone whose email address was something similar to "autism uk" possibly.  1996 was a long time ago, so... um, yeah, I don't remember.  Sorry.
<br />
<br />
<br />I just read Membler's post.  I think that the emulator was called "nesa".

<br />
<br />According to some website I'm reading called <a href="http://www.emuwiki.com/index.php?title=The_Emulation_Timeline" class="postlink">"The Emulation Timeline"</a>, VSMC (snes emulator) existed back in September 1994, but that website doesn't list any NES emulators before 1997.  The first NES emulator it mentions is "Nes Lord".
