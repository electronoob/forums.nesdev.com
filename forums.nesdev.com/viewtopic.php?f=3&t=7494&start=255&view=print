<br />
<br />
<br />Actually it was a bit better than assigning a new mapper number per se.  It assigns a "sub mapper". Untangling the mess of say, MMC1 turns the special cases of mapper 1 into separate sub mappers.  The games are still mapper 1, but now there's a submapper to tell them apart.  This was so the ROMs would still be mapper 1 in ines1.0 to older emulators (and there was no reason to assign new numbers when they were all technically MMC1).   I denoted 'em kinda like revisions.   mapper 1.0 being barefoot stock MMC1,  1.1  being 16K of WRAM, etc.   This turned out to be extremely easy to support in the end,  I only had to add a few dozen lines of 6502 asm to support them on my FPGA.  
<br />
<br />Be that as it may, I did add 4 more bits of mapper number just in case it was ever needed.  (The sub-mapper number is 4 bits also, so that gives a total of 16 bits worth of mapper state)
<br />
<br />Just using the submapper part allowed me to totally eliminate every single checking hack I had to perform in my code.  Yes, every single check.  This allowed me to drop the CRC code (I was actually CRCing in hardware as the games were loaded),  size checking code,  and every other form of tests/hacks I had to do during loading to properly select the mapper.

To me, the mapper variant field would be better used for different variants of MMC3 IRQ counter behavior, presence or absence of MMC1 WRAM protection, SL vs. CL configuration on MMC5, the different ways the VRC can be wired, and anything else that can't be reliably determined from the sizes of PRG ROM, CHR ROM, and various RAMs.

<br />
<br />yup. I'm following iNES2.0 since the beginning and I also have added barebone support for the additional header fields in MESS. would you mind to post a list of the submappers at some point? I'd like to support the variants properly.

<br />Because it makes no sense, and having multiple ways of doing the same exact thing just makes it harder for everyone.
<br />
<br />&gt; they're not random, they are (or should be, once confirmed) the names present on the chip label, followed by the pcb position as extension
<br />
<br />As I said, random. An emulator cannot predict where chips appeared on a PCB and how to put them together based on the filenames.

<br />Tell me how the fuck I am supposed to load these two games without an internal database telling me what each file is and where it goes?
<br />
<br />&gt; and it's not for nothing: it allows the 0.001% of the userbase to repair original carts and we are happy to make this possible for that tiny niche 
<br />
<br />What about the 99.999% of the userbase that wants their NSS games to work on other emulators? Why aren't you happy to make that possible for that super majority?
<br />
<br />&gt; except they would not know which part goes where. or how to split files to match the chips.
<br />
<br />Oh come on. Someone who can desolder, flash, and solder new chips onto boards can figure out how to split up files. Stick the info in an XML file on a website and be done with it.
<br />
<br />&gt; other arcade emulator have no problem supporting separate files when they emulate NeoGeo or CPS1/CPS2 games. why only console emulators find it that difficult? 
<br />
<br />It makes sense sometimes, possibly with NES PRG/CHR files for instance (I wouldn't know, I haven't worked with the NES.) It does not make sense for the SNES.
<br />
<br />&gt; the sprite editing tool should simply be updated to handle byteswapped images.
<br />
<br />I give up.

<br />
<br />pushing a bit more the xml approach you already use for memory maps? just have some xml node prescribing where to load the files and let user add the xml in the same folder as the roms (like you do for mmio related xmls)

<br />
<br />Some cartridges could batteryback the RAM while others may not.  An example of this is on MMC5.  Carts exist with 16K of WRAM that's half battery backed and half that isn't,  while other carts contain 8K or 32K of WRAM which is battery backed.   A size field won't tell this apart very easily unless you assume 16K WRAM games always back half only.
<br />
<br />I actually do have a version of mapper 1 for the missing WRAM protect bit.
<br />
<br />As for the MMC3, is there a documented case where you must use one MMC3 revision over the other?  I've been curious about that but haven't been able to definitively find a case that needs it yet.
<br />
<br />And on the MMC5, what does SL and CL mode do?  Again, I have not been able to tell any difference between the two.  I suspect it has something to do with split screen mode, but since only 1 game uses it (and it uses it in the intro) I am not sure it matters for emulation sake.  (the game btw is SDF).  I actually changed the mode on my CV3 cart a long time ago, and played it but nothing happened.  It just played normally.
<br />
<br />For emulating VRC2 and VRC4, you can use bit masks to cover all the cases, which is what I do.  This way it does not require any special mapper handling.  It just works for all cases instead.  (Technically though, you COULD use submappers for this but I am not sure if it's required since the current solution results in all the games being playable without any hacks per se).
<br />
<br />The notable cases I used submappers were for the BNROM mapper;  since someone jammed two games into one mapper (BNROM - Deadly Towers and Impossible Mission 2).   ALso, the Subor mapper was two separate mappers jammed into one.  
<br />
<br />I ended up submappering all the MMC3 variations for completeness sake (The CHRAM+CHROM ones, and the ones with fixed mirroring like Karnov and Holy Diver) but I didn't change the headers because the current solution still works.
<br />
<br />Once I get my hands on the latest set, I will go through and 2.0 fix all the required headers and release a complete specification document along with a header pack or similar (and it should be in an upcoming goodNES too).

<br />
<br />Hmm, I must've gotten that confused;  I don't have my list here at the moment.  It's that game that uses an MMC3 but used the address lines(!) routed to the MMC3's data lines.  I assume for copy protection.
<br />
<br />I think it's actually "Time Diver Avenger" (mapper 250 or so?).   If that's not it, I will check when I get home.

<br />otoh, I'm not sure how would you handle exactly vrc2/vrc4. does iNES2.0 have anything different for these compared to iNES?

<br />
<br />EDIT: btw FitzRoy, does your database take into account the different pin configurations of Mapper 185 games? (see <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://nesdev.com/bbs/viewtopic.php?t=2797">http://nesdev.com/bbs/viewtopic.php?t=2797</a><!-- m --> and <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://nesdev.com/bbs/viewtopic.php?t=6481">http://nesdev.com/bbs/viewtopic.php?t=6481</a><!-- m --> )
<br />
<br />Those games cannot be handled as generic 'mapper 185' since they need specific protection values to be read at start... in MESS we added the pin settings as xml attributes
<br />
<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&lt;feature name=&quot;chr-pin26&quot; value=&quot;CE&quot; /&gt;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&lt;feature name=&quot;chr-pin27&quot; value=&quot;/CE&quot; /&gt;</div>

<br />but I'm not sure if bootgod includes this info in the db profile of the website (it should be in his xml, though, iirc)

<br />I did it to reduce the filesize by 2/3 and use a stronger hash.

An example of this is on MMC5.  Carts exist with 16K of WRAM that's half battery backed and half that isn't,  while other carts contain 8K or 32K of WRAM which is battery backed.   A size field won't tell this apart very easily unless you assume 16K WRAM games always back half only.</div>
<br />Yes, and ZapFC lists the WRAM field as an ampersand separated list of chip sizes, with an asterisk after each chip which is battery backed. A notion I have not fully supported in QuickNES yet because I haven't researched how different mappers support WRAM greater than 8KB. It currently searches the whole string for an asterisk and sets the battery backed flag for the whole 8KB it does support. Well, unless any of the mappers I didn't explicitly write myself happen to support more than 8KB of WRAM already. (Since I think QuickNES mostly handles the WRAM block outside of the mapper implementation, and the mappers only set flags which control whether the WRAM is readable and/or writeable.)
