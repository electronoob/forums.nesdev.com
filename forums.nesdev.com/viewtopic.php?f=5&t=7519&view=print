		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Hello everyone. I wasn't quite sure where to post this, so I'll post it here. Ever since I got back into writing programs for the NES, I've had a few questions I wanted to ask people still involved with either developing or even just playing new home brewed games.
<br />
<br />When do you think we will reach a point where most NES units have stopped working and there are no more replacement parts to service them?
<br />
<br />Will there ever be a source of new parts for our machines?
<br />
<br />Will there ever be a true NES replica that behaves exactly like the original?
<br />
<br />Will NES development continue even when there are no more working units available?
<br />
<br />I honestly don't think I would continue NES development if I didn't have a working system to run games on. It would also be a terrible shame to not have a NES to play the cartridges I own and all the new home brewed games out there. What are your thoughts? I imagine some people here have considered these things. Would you continue to  develop for a system that only exists through emulation?

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />In regards to hardware, I don't think it will be such an easy task. The system itself consists of two parts: the CPU with the APU, and the PPU. While the 6502 CPU can be easily and cheaply bought as they are <a href="http://www.westerndesigncenter.com/wdc/w65c02s-chip.cfm" class="postlink">manufacture and sold to this day</a>, however good luck getting a non-emulated way to produce sound and video out of the system.
<br />
<br />(Of course, that's more of an opinion, and I'm not sure if what I've said is accurate.)

Since this can be emulated almost perfectly by modern hardware, I think I'd be just as happy playing NES games on emulation hardware as the real system. You could almost think of an emulator as a bytecode game scripting engine for retro games. But, it would definitely be awesome if the hardware is perfectly replicated some day. I really hope it will be. The NES on a chip isn't so bad if it weren't for the horrible sound!

I wish I knew how to read photomicrographs and use FPGA tools.

I'm very glad to hear that if so. At least if the hardware is never reproduced, NES emulator authors would have something to test against. Maybe even one day computers will be powerful enough to run a complete simulation at a speed adequate for gaming.

<br />
<br />I have to admit your perspective is reassuring. The reason I enjoy programming for the NES is in fact the ideas, constraints, and the simple joy of 6502 coding. Even if NES development where restricted to emulation, it would still be alot more fun then programming in Java  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=":wink:" title="Wink" /> .

Technology may advance in the future to a point where cloning the NES is trivial. I imagine eventually someone will make a 1:1 clone of the NES given its huge popularity.
