<br />
<br />No. I really am a control freak, particularly when it comes to creative projects. I really want to code this stuff from scratch as much as possible, knowing that it'll be worth it in the long run because it'll help me better understand NES programming (especially as it pertains to MMC5). 
<br />
<br />And, someday, having banked credibility from this "Alpha" game, I hope to pursue the concept of creating a custom mapper called MMC7, which I believe would be the best showcase for my "Omega" game. (A real-time RPG with 4-screen mirroring, allowing for artifact-free diagonal scrolling and expanded sound channels.)
<br />
<br />Both of these plans coincide well with their flagship games' respective mission statements; "Alpha" shall be a celebration of what was, whereas "Omega" will be a celebration of what could have been.

<br />
<br />In that case, it might be advantageous to look into something along those lines. My only problem with hex editors is that there's no realistic way of adding comments to each section of code. I believe this is one of the major strengths of assemblers?

I figure out what needs to happen, diagram various ways of making it happen, revise the diagram until I've got a "best-fit" approach, translate it 6502 code, type it into the ROM, then try it out. If it works, yay! If it sucks, I open the Debug window and begin tracking down the problem. Eventually, bugs are found/fixed and the show goes on!<br /><br />As for demos, I've already got a functional (if unrefined) title screen, and am currently working on the Transition Handler to progress to Level Zero. Level Zero is going to start out as a panoramic single screen, as I want to establish main character controls before I begin work on the scroll engine, maps, enemies, etc. When I feel that the controls are in decent shape, I'll consider releasing that as Demo1.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">3gengames wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">Pick up an assembler, and try it.

<br />IMO, the most basic thing assemblers provide that I can't imagine living without is the possibility to name variables and addresses.
<br />
<br />Consider the following scenario: You have a functional program with a subroutine you use a lot. Say you find a bug in a piece of code that comes before this subroutine, and to fix the bug you have to make the code 1 byte longer, meaning that the subroutine I mentioned before has to be pushed 1 byte forward. If you use this subroutine 20 times throughout your program, you'll have to remember and find them all to change the address that comes after the JSR instruction. Forget one and your program might crash.
<br />
<br />The program with hex edited programs is that they are not maintainable at all. If you need to make any change, it's hell. You have to practically check and rewrite the whole program to make even the smallest change.

<br />Actually, there are a number of ways to achieve artifact-free 8-way scrolling without 4-screen mirroring, even without the aid of mappers. All you have to do is mask out the artifacts, either with timed code (vertical mirroring) or at the expense of a few sprites (horizontal mirroring).

<br />
<br />True, true. I've also heard rumors that <em>diagonal</em> mirroring would allow for artifact-free eight-way scrolling (although definitive proof remains elusive).
<br />
<br />Still, I can't be the only one who yearns for a day when we don't have to perform such logistical gymnastics / sprite trade-offs?
