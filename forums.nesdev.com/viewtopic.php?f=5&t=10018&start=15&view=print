The fact that you stepped down as maintainer of your NES and Super NES documentation shows that the answer is no, but where should one draw the line?</div>It doesn't entitle anyone (the license specifically says there is NO WARRANTY), although if the support is on a public forum, then the author can offer support if they want to, and other people can, too, if they want to. Sometimes separate support contracts are offered for a price.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">koitsu wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">You introduced a phrase that completely skews/messes up the point: you introduced the phrase <strong>without charge</strong>.<br /><br />The fact that something is free does not mean the person is off the hook when it comes to responsibility (there are lots of examples of this being proven true legally too).  Money should have no bearing on this situation -- remember, &quot;free as in free beer&quot; and &quot;open-source is awesome because it's free&quot; and all that nonsense.  So please don't introduce the financial aspect into it...</div>But the software is available for NO WARRANTY.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">koitsu wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">I believe very strongly that if someone releases open-source software publicly, they have a responsibility to maintain it all the way up until their departure from the project.  Part of that responsibility means you don't take your crappy uncommented code with no docs or explanations of how it works/details and throw it up on github and leave it there to rot -- this does nobody any good except the author, who then gives off a narcissistic &quot;fuck everyone else, only looking out for number one&quot; vibe.</div>That is true that it doesn't do anyone any good, but at least it does things better than a proprietary software would be.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">In my opinion, responsibility dictates 4 things before project departure:<br /><br />1) Address all the aforementioned items before &quot;their last/final commit&quot; -- i.e. get the software into a usable, stable, well-documented state before leaving,<br /><br />2) If maintained by a single person: that they do their best to try and find someone who can actively maintain it who is also willing to accept the responsibilities.  (I mention that acceptance for a reason -- proftpd is a great example of open-source software that got handed over to people who had no idea what the fuck they were doing with it / did not understand it (and existed in this form for something like 4-5 full years!).  The history of that program is an absolute clusterfuck, it's one of the biggest examples of open-source failing the world, and is only slightly an example of how open-source benefits the world),<br /><br />3) Publicly explain why (and always be honest) they can't (or don't want to) maintain the software any longer,<br /><br />4) Be reasonable about future support requests, even in cases where they couldn't find someone to maintain the software.  One should <strong>expect</strong>, for at least 2-3 years, to possibly be tracked down + contacted about issues in the software.  And be polite in communication -- an example would be &quot;Hi, I'm sorry but I don't maintain that software any longer.  The reasons I don't are listed in the foobarblat.txt file {link to it}.  That said, the bug you describe sounds like it's within function xyz() and may relate to a change in abc introduced elsewhere.  I can't help past this point -- my apologies&quot;.<br /><br />This is all common sense shit to me.  I don't know why having to outline it is necessary.  God what I'd give for us Americans to go back to common sense...  :P</div>I agree with you about these things, it is best to do so when possible (it might not always be). I agree that if you do get someone else to maintain it, you should get someone who is doing a good job; however, you might also just leave it and then someone else can fork it.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I'd like to see open-source with crowd-funded commissions of fixes/improvements, if it's not being done. Free fails I believe for two reasons.<br /><br />Free doesn't give reliable information to the author about what's most important to users, because they don't have to give anything up to make requests. If they were paying money, they would only pay for things that were valuable to them, and would think of what was most important. And then the aggregate of users would show which was most valuable. This valuation would also give the author an idea of whether it was worth even implementing, based on how much was offered.<br /><br />Free doesn't support the author's own costs in implementing things. The author has to bring in money to pay for living and the tools to make the software. If there is no payment, then the author will only work on things that are more enjoyable than the other things he could be doing with his free time. With payment, he can reduce his other work and work on the open-source software more, and justify less-enjoyable activities. The level of payment that users offer allows the all-important economic calculation to occur, figuring what balance between all these things is most effective.<br /><br />The paid commission approach is nice because it doesn't &quot;taint&quot; the program; the program is a kind of communally-owned resource that it just happens that mainly one person is adding to, which people chip in to pay for.<br /><br />...<br /><br />My personal experience with open-source programs is that many are fantastically buggy (gnome-mplayer, I'm looking at you, you buggy POS that core dumps half the time when I close it). It's pathetic. Almost every one looks like someone had a lot of enthusiasm to make a program, but ran out part way through and just skipped finishing the rest of the features. Perhaps that's why command-line programs are generally better, because they mostly focus on doing one thing well.<br /><br />...<br /><br />Re: koitsu's comments on bailing on one's own work, that is the single biggest thing that hurts to this day about all my emulation work. In hindsight (always 20/20!) I see how much better I could have done things to make them more maintainable to others. It's funny you mention kids, because it feels like I just abandoned these kids in a state that nobody else could continue. (save the &quot;oh you did some great stuff&quot; because I know I did, as this is something that ties in with other issues I have and will take a long time to resolve)<br /><br />In retrospect I totally dig the almost impersonal way of doing things as is done on Wikis, where the tone of everything is similar and extremely dry. The work stands above any one author and everyone can add to it without upsetting its consistency.

You don't need to have an explanation for not doing free work. What's a valid explanation in your mind? What's an invalid one? If the reasons are personal, then that person has a right to keep them private. If they're legal, that should be explained if it would affect future users of the project. If the reason is just disinterest, I don't see why that's not valid in itself.<br /><br />I would agree that there are good practices to take when abandoning something that people use. You should at least plant a flag to declare this, so that anyone coming to it will know what the current state of maintenance is. A handoff is better, if such a person is available, but there probably isn't in most cases. Even if it's just abandoned without a word, leaving an open source project is still a step above abandoning a free but closed source project, at least.<br /><br />I might think less of someone for abandoning a project in a poor way, but I wouldn't hold anything against someone for failing to give a reason for stopping their volunteer software development.

Of course someone could also fix it themself, if the author refuses, or if the other people are unable to pay, or other reasons; this is also the benefit. They might still accept patches, or maybe not, but either way, crowd-funded commissions can certainly help too.

If the reason is just disinterest, I don't see why that's not valid in itself.</div><br />It's perfectly valid -- &quot;I'm no longer interested&quot; is a public explanation of why, as is &quot;personal reasons&quot;, or pretty much anything else.<br /><br />My recommendation stems from boatloads of projects (again, see Sourceforge, Freshmeat, and even github (despite how young it is)) where the maintainer(s) have disappeared.  Support requests go unheeded, Emails (if you can dig them up) go unanswered, that sort of thing; nobody knows if the project is abandoned or not, and if so no one knows why.  It's even worse when the source repo is controlled/owned by 1 person and so nobody can really improve on the existing repo's code (I've seen this happen a lot with github).  Anyway, the needs vary per project; I'll give you 3 examples: the proftpd project, the Tomato project, and a project which will remain nameless.<br /><br />With proftpd, the (sole) maintainer just disappeared -- after many months, Emails started bouncing, mailing lists continued to function albeit suffering from spam and security holes, and the author was no where to be found.  Nobody knew if he had died or what.  It took years to &quot;regain control&quot; over this whole situation -- and as I understand it, the situation actually happened two different times (my memory could be wrong here, I'm having to think back to 1996 or thereabouts).  I remember this situation because I used proftpd at the time (when Parodius was running Linux) and the massive numbers of security holes kept piling up with no response from the author, and no way to truly rectify the issue &quot;officially&quot; other than Jimmy Bob Jhonka releasing patches, while Derpa Herpa Xavier Sr. releases different patches, yadda yadda.  After 5 or 6 security issues + that nonsense, I gave up on the daemon entirely.<br /><br />With Tomato, the situation is similar -- nobody is sure if the author exists/is alive because he doesn't respond to Email.  I'm not talking about support requests, I'm talking about forked projects who need clarification on the license (if you can even call it that) used throughout the source code.  It's believed that he's alive/around but chooses to intentionally not respond (this is based on, for example, that his domain is registered until 2022, but the last domain update/modification was in December 2012).  Regardless, as a result, nobody dares touch/change certain pieces of the code (as well as certain pieces of the HTML/CSS/Javascript) because nobody can get clarification on the license.<br /><br />The nameless project situation was this -- there was a fellow who maintained a very good set of bare metal software (applied KISS principle, did not add unnecessary features, hated creeping featurism, etc.) and was very communicative with end-users.  Over time, the guy started acting strangely and eventually disappeared.  After much prodding, it was admitted privately to 1 or maybe 2 people at most that his wife had died and as a result he had effectively just &quot;shut down&quot;.  None of this was public (and still isn't).  So users of this code (as well as people who helped participate with in that project) didn't know what to do for support, and public disclosure of what had happened could never occur due to the private nature of the situation.  Users were left in the dark with no (public) reason.<br /><br />Now you see why a public statement of some kind is useful when leaving a project, vs. just going AWOL.  The reason / what's said doesn't matter as much as the fact that <strong>something</strong> is said -- that's the responsibility aspect I speak of.

Just because it's popular never means it's good, VLC kicks MPlayer in to the trash and shoots it in the face.<br /><br />Still, I also think even open source software is crap to edit...they expect patches from one person? When there's one person on the GUI, file handling, etc of a program? Nah, forget that. I wish they had a &quot;pay to advance features faster&quot; format, that'd be interesting to see how it would go. Give a dollar with 10 tokens. Whatever has the most tokens gets highest priority. That'd be neat to see.<br /><br />Still...I like free software because when it works, it's much faster than paid software in nearly ever application. Also they usually support more formats. Libre vs MS Office, Audacious vs WMP/iTunes, VLC vs...WMP again? All the free software is top notch, faster, and offers better support already, and is only getting more advanced than paid/paid OS software each day.

People who know this person &quot;in real life&quot; probably had few ideas of the free software the guy wrote and was actively maintening.<br /><br />I agree about that less than 2% of people are able to debug software and so on. Myself I typically use print statements as a debug method, or any other method that involves visible output, rather than an actual debugger. Only in some particular situation I bothered to use an actual debugger.<br /><br />Reardless, uderstanding someone else's code is often more time consuming and more complex than writing yourself a clone of the code, implementing the same functionality. It's completely counter intuitive, but I figured out this is sadly true (at least for me). Of course it depends of the coding style, language, etc, etc... but overal that's the sad reality.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">There is good and bad software of both kinds.
