<br />
<br />If you're not going to work on President, and you don't want criticism for working on something like a puzzle game, why don't you make a game like NESnake 2? That wasn't necessarily what I'd call a puzzle game, and it wasn't really that complex, but that game is DAMN fun. I was really impressed by that when it came out.

<br />I made the Nibbles demo found on various PD ROM sites, but I never got around to polishing it. And I probably won't because NESnake 2 does the same thing so much better. Gorillas, the other familiar QBasic game, is already done by Chris Covell under the name Solar Wars.

<br />As a random sidenote, the most common Swedish naming of this card game is "nigger and president". It sure puts yet another twist on the possibility of offense that you mention above... ;)

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />So I'm developing an NES project that comes with several dozen 16x16 pixel emblems. I've come up with one game involving these emblems, but I'm starting to think an I Can Remember clone with a plot and an editor is not enough to sell carts. Is there anything other than card matching that would use a bunch of what are essentially favicons? I tried using Google to look up "favicon game", but that just resulted in JavaScript games that play on a canvas inside a web browser's favicon space: interesting in its own way, but not what I want.

I don't know exactly how that would work, but I can kind of see it.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />It might be helpful to have a list of the icons, just for better brainstorming (from the video):
<br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">boy<br />cherry<br />shovel<br />fish<br />space ship?<br />triangle<br />axe<br />circle<br />fishing pole<br />square<br />watering can<br />orange<br />walnut?<br />beetle<br />apple<br />pear<br />X<br />net</div>
<br />
<br />What can you do with these? Obviously they are most suited to something like a matching game, but there are a lot of possibilities, just not all perfectly fitting.  You could use them for all sorts of random minigames: falling block/"Bejeweled" sorts of games, as selectable avatars for a board game like Monopoly, as collectibles in a sidescroller or single screen level-based games such as Lolo.
<br />
<br />As far as selling though?  I don't know if a lot of people would buy a puzzle game or "classic" game like Concentration, even if packed in with other minigames.  I don't mean to be really discouraging but it just doesn't seem like the type of game to make if selling is important to you - I imagine the majority of sales would be specifically to support your work or for collecting purposes.
<br />
<br />I suppose I'm not an expert on what would sell on an old game console, but I think people would expect/want a meatier experience, something that makes the NES worth dusting off and not something they could do using a deck of cards.  Sidescrollers, top down adventures, RPGs, perhaps shooters, generally something character-based that has maps and stages.  And I know those are more difficult to develop, but it seems natural that they would attract more sales, considering that is where nostalgia lies for most people.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />So Nova was playing the crap out of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dian_Shi_Mali" class="postlink">Dian Shi Mali</a>, the "PUSH START TO RICH" game starring the anthropomorphic personification of FORTRAN in a Mario costume. I looked at screenshots and realized I had a chance to finish something that had been brewing in my head since 2000. I started to heavily retouch the slot machine symbols. But once I got to the cherry, I remembered I had redrawn all the Animal Crossing fruits and tools a couple years ago for a different project, and those were far clearer than Dian Shi Mali's fruits,  although in less of a stereotypical slot-machine style. Then I had a brainstorming session with a copy of Character Map and a copy of GIMP. I turned to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miscellaneous_Symbols" class="postlink">Miscellaneous Symbols block</a> (aka Wingdings) of GNOME's character map and started sketching furiously.
<br />
<br />The video is level 3, which has only half the 36 emblems. Here are all of them:
<br />
<br /><strong>Dian Shi Mali symbols:</strong>
<br />coin, star
<br /><strong>Animal Crossing fruits:</strong>
<br />apple, cherry, orange, peach (yes, it's badly drawn), pear
<br /><strong>Animal Crossing tools:</strong>
<br />shovel, watering can, axe, fishing rod, bug net
<br /><strong>Other Animal Crossing-inspired emblems:</strong>
<br />fish, bug
<br /><strong>PlayStation button symbols:</strong>
<br />Δ, O, X, ロ
<br /><strong>Card suits:</strong>
<br />heart, spade, club, diamond
<br /><strong>Zoop powerups:</strong>
<br />bomb, circular saw blade, splotch, spring
<br /><strong>Emblems I drew while looking through Wingdings in Character Map:</strong>
<br />boy, girl, sun, cloud, umbrella, snowman, taijitu, peace sign
<br /><strong>Emblems related to things in Wingdings in Character Map that didn't make the cut:</strong>
<br />Republican elephant, Democratic donkey
<br />
<br />The only other video game I know of with such a huge collection of 16x16 pixel favicons is Mario Paint.
<br />
<br />As for other genres, I plan to try to make a Mario-style game once I finish this.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Oh, now there's an idea, slots.  Do it up Pokemon style, where more coins means more winning rows or diagonals.  You could add a gambling system to Concentration too (at the risk of destroying the premise) and be well on your way to a set of minigames like the ones in Mario 64 DS.
<br />
<br />There was one where all the cards are face up, lined up from top to bottom and you match adjacent cards to remove them (horizontally, vertically and diagonally).  Every other card slides upwards to fill the empty spaces with more coming up from the bottom, changing the entire layout with each match.  That might work with a set of icons like those.

<br />Neither is Latin capital letter O a circle in every font. But Katakana RO is the only square-ish letter I know of. Does Sony consistently use a Unicode code point for each of the PlayStation button symbols?
<br />
<br />So it appears you suggest something like SameGame, Pokemon Trozei, Krazy Kreatures, etc.
