<br />
<br />The same thing can be done for the bbs if we ask Koitsu. It all depends on the goal we have about the future of the BBS (keep phpBB 2.0 data or start from scratch).
<br />
<br />Since Memblers is the rightful owner of the BBS, I guess we should ask him which direction he wants to go. He seems to have access to some hosting too.
<br />
<br />As for the nesdev.com domain, we can negociate with Koitsu to receive the domain for nesdev wiki/bbs. This could be a chance to unify the nesdev community under the same name like:
<br />
<br />- wiki.nesdev.com
<br />- bbs.nesdev.com
<br />
<br />or whatever we find appropriate.
<br />
<br />I think we shouldn't rush thing and make the proper decision: we still have some time and Koitsu will help up any way he can (he's a nice guy, you know).

<br />Only a few threads about new discoveries about the hardware or things like that are actually relevant.

<br />
<br />I vote for keeping the entire forums archived.  I feel that the history of each discussion is worth preserving.  I first joined you guys+gals in October, 2010.  I spent a great deal of time reading old posts - getting to know each of you before I ever posted.  I remember reading the epic thread on the reverse engineering of the CIC and feeling in awe of how bad-ass you all are.
<br />
<br />I had no idea how much nesdev costs to run.  I would have pledged $100/year or more had I known.
<br />
<br />I am glad that Tepples is working on the archiving the data.
<br />
<br />Tepples, can you craft a python program that I can run on my Linux desktop to scrape all of my PMs.  Dumping them into a single TXT or HTML file is fine.  If not, I'll start on a utility in a week or so, but mine will be in perl.
<br />
<br />Koitsu/Tepples/Memblers: are our BBS and Wiki passwords in the mysql database plain-text, hashes or fully reversible encryption?
<br />
<br />I'm fine with a dump (or portion of) of the mysql database becoming available for public download, so long as the password hash/whatever is wiped and PMs are omitted.
<br />
<br />Guys, keep the ideas flowing.

<br />
<br />I did the install of the wiki at the beginning but I don't know how mediawiki secure their password. I guess they must hash them at the least but I must confirm.  
<br />
<br />We could still keep the wiki/phpbb "as-is" on the next server. maybe this is the best solution after all since nobody would lose any data.  Thinking about how to archive the content in the future for any possible lost of data wouldn't be a bad idea though.

<br />If I were doing it, I'd import the wiki through a database dump, start the BBS fresh with phpBB 3, and keep static HTML versions of BBS 1.0 (wwwThreads) and BBS 2.0 (this phpBB 2 board). Then there might be a project on the new NESdev to go through each of the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SiMHTK15Pik" class="postlink">almost 9000</a> topics on BBS 2.0 and summarize relevant information on the wiki.
<br />
<br />Tonight I plan to add timestamp checking and image downloading to the wiki scraper so that I can keep running it weekly to pick up page changes.

<br />I can see benefits to upgrading (new features and possibly better security), but what benefits are there to starting from scratch with phpBB3 if the automated conversion from the phpBB2 database works fine?

<br />
<br />We done it exactly what you call stupid, starting from scratch and having a read-only archived board.
<br />I think the transition was handled greatly back then.
<br />
<br />Also guys, you should know that everything has a start and an end, including your own life, and the messages you writes, etc....
<br />People nowdays seems to assume that since things have become digital, it will last forever.
<br />It won't. Future generations won't want to deal with billions of hard disks of data that was used by their ancestors and will have no room to physically store all this, not to mention the hard disks themselves will fail, etc...
<br />
<br />I think stuff that is relevant should be preserved, and non-relevant things should be cleaned up sometimes in a while. This applies to my room too, how many crapload of stuff I have that is no longer relevant ?
<br />
<br />Anyways it's not up to me to decide, I was just pointing that deletion of some data is not the end of the world, and can even be good as it means less required storage space for the new future Nesdev website, so less costs, etc...
<br />Of course I shouldn't say stuff should be deleted without thinking - that's NOT what I said.
<br />I think relevant threads or info should be archived and cleaned up and moved to somewhere brand new.
<br />
<br />The most important thing to me is that the Nesdev community continues to live somewhere, that people continues to make games, demos, tools, and cool hardware quick discoveries about the NES, and that the hardware and the tools related to the NES (assemblers, tile editors, etc...) are properly available and documented, so that someone who wants to make a NES game can actually do it.
<br />
<br />Starting something brand new should be seen as a chance to replace this old thread that, while great, is regularly flooded by spamers, and the good but messy wiki, by a stronger and better new structure. Keep the old stuff and copy it as it somewhere else would not do any good to the Nesdev community.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Mainly for Tepples:
<br />
<br />After having a chance to review logs, bandwidth graphs, etc. I'd like to propose that the harvesting script for the existing 2.0 BBS -- assuming that is the route the community/mods/etc. decide to do -- be run on the server itself, followed by the directory being tar + gzip'd up (or zip; doesn't matter to me) then copied off somewhere where it can be extracted.
<br />
<br />The reason has to do with bandwidth usage.  The existing infrastructure (that would be the 2.0 BBS) does not make use of deflate/gzip compression via HTTP, thus the bandwidth used via HTTP-over-the-Internet will be much higher than if the script was run locally then the results compressed + scp/rsync/ftp'd off somewhere.
<br />
<br />Gotta keep in mind that we've got 40-50 hosting people who are all in the process of trying to offload their stuff, so I'm having to juggle a lot of "bandwidth balls" (haha) in the air as a result.
<br />
<br />Also, there was concern over the existing links that point to <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://nesdev.com/">http://nesdev.com/</a><!-- m -->{whatever} -- no, there is zero guarantee that I will continue to provide DNS records within the parodius.com domain (or subdomains) after October 31st.  So if you want links to work, they should be re-written by the Python script.  It shouldn't be that hard:
<br />
<br />s#http://nesdev.com/bbs/#http://new.url/forum/#g;
<br />s#http://nesdev.com/#http://new.url/#g;
<br />
<br />You get the idea (and order of s/// statements matters as I'm sure you can figure out).  That should pretty much do it.

<br />I agree with an upgrade/import of the existing board rather than starting new. Archives make searching for particular topics that much harder <em>and</em> require people to re‐register. Sometimes this is necessary, but with a SQL dump of the database it’s totally possible to preserve everything. Why do anything else?
