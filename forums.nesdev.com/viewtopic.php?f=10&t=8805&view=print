<br />
<br />It works for me but slows down the game a bit so I want to speed it up by converting this into assembly but I really hate assembly and don't know where to start.
<br />
<br />Basically it sees if the right side of my sprite is off screen and then it replaces it with a blank tile and changes the Y to the bottom of the screen so that I don't run out of sprites per scan line.
<br />
<br />Thanks.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Edit: Ah man... Saw the "figured it out" edit only after the post. Oh well.  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_lol.gif" alt=":lol:" title="Laughing" /> What did the issue end up being? 
<br />
<br />I too would doubt this is what's (directly) causing your problem. I think it's more likely that everything else you're doing is using ALMOST all of your frame time, and this most recent thing you added is just the straw that broke the camel's back.
<br />
<br />First question, how many times is this routine run? If it's just once, you definitely need to optimize elsewhere. Second question, what is _SHIFTM and why are you multiplying by it? Multiplication is pretty slow most of the time, and I don't follow why it would be needed at all for this.
<br />
<br />Here are the assumptions I'm going to make:
<br />1. That X and ScrollX are 16 bits.
<br />2. That X and ScrollX can never go below 0. 
<br />3. That X can never be less ScrollX.
<br />4. That you don't care about what tile the sprite will display or the actual position at all, as long as the sprite is not seen.
<br />
<br />If any of these assumptions is incorrect, this code won't work for you.
<br />
<br />Things I don't know, so I will ignore:
<br />1. What sprid is. (The fifth argument for the oam_spr function)
<br />2. Why the multiplication is happening.
<br />
<br />If any of these things are important, this code won't work for you.
<br />
<br />In assembly, I guess it'd look something like this:
<br />
<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;lda low&#40;X&#41;;X-ScrollX<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;sec<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;sbc low&#40;ScrollX&#41;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;sta temp<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;lda high&#40;X&#41;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;sbc high&#40;ScrollX&#41;;If the high byte is nonzero after the subtraction<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;bne spritewrapped;We're guaranteed to be greater than 230<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;;Else, if the low byte is &gt;= to 230<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;lda temp<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;cmp #230<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;bcc nowrap<br />spritewrapped:<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;lda #255<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;ldx #012;Change if this isn't right, I'm honestly just guessing based on sprid<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;ldy #$05;Number of times we're supposed to loop.<br />spritewrap.loop:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;sta OAM_BUF,x<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;inx<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;inx<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;inx<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;inx<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;dey<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;bne spritewrap.loop<br />nowrap:<br /></div>
<br />This will only save you around 375* cycles over the C code which is barely significant. Unless this code is being run a lot, something else must be eating your frame time. (Unless it's that multiplication.) Keep in mind, I'm not familiar with this C  setup at all. I downloaded it to get some basic info, but there's no guarantee this will play nicely with it or whatever. 
<br />
<br />*:12*4(for avoiding the jsr popa's in each call to oam_spr)+15(for avoiding unneeded write to the buffer. If they're offscreen their X position/tile/attributes don't matter or need to be written)+12(for the jsr to and rts from oam_spr in the first place)*5(because their are five calls to it to oam_spr)

<br />
<br />For future reference, if you're wondering what your C code looks like in assembly, you could always use NESICIDE -- it'll show you mixed-mode C/assembly.   <img src="./images/smilies/icon_cool.gif" alt="8)" title="Cool" />

<br />Maybe you mean the slowness of <strong>C code</strong> on the NES? There are a few outstanding NES games that prove it can do a lot despite all limitations, if programmers are competent.
