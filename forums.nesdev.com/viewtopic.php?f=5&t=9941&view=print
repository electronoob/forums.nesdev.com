		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I imagine this is more of a question for hardware folks, but it's something that has boggled me for many years now.<br /><br />As we all know LCDs (think TFT LCDs, but IPS vs. TFT vs. PVA vs. MVA is not the topic) lack an electron gun, i.e. <a href="http://belogic.com/uzebox/images/field-rendering.gif" class="postlink">this nonsense</a> should no longer apply to the same degree as in the past.<br /><br />It's this fact that has always made me wonder how VBlank and HBlank actually work on an LCD.  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Tearing_%28simulated%29.jpg" class="postlink">Tearing</a> (<a href="http://www.tweakguides.com/images/GGDSG_19.jpg" class="postlink">example 2</a>) does in fact happen on LCDs, even though (logically, in my mind) you would expect to see no such thing for a couple of reasons (mainly that there's no electron gun, and the fact that transistor updates on LCDs only happen when there's an actual change).<br /><br />I'm focusing on LCDs hooked up via pure digital, by the way, such as DVI (not using the analog pins) or HDMI.  In the case of DVI's analog pins, sure <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Visual_Interface" class="postlink">pins 8 and C4</a> are used for vertical and horizontal sync -- and the same Wikipedia article references that DVI's digital interface offers synchronisation capabilities, so there must be &quot;something&quot; going on between the LCD and the video adapter.<br /><br />The only idea I can come up with is that HBlank and VBlank are effectively emulated using some sort of arbitrary delay/timing mechanism, e.g. HBlank would consist of a delay after the monitor updates all the transistor switches on pixel row X but before starting on pixel row X+1, e.g. VBlank would consist of a delay after the monitor updates the final/last row of transistors at the bottom but before returning to pixel row 0.<br /><br />Thoughts/insights?

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />LCD drivers still function row-at-a-time. Even on TFT screens that have a capacitor and transistor to drive every pixel, the process of updating the screen is still incredibly bandwidth intensive, so you have to update it in <strong>some</strong> order.<br /><br />It is possible to have hblank and vblank have 0 length, though.<br /><br />For tearing, that's a software/driver problem, same as with CRTs. (unless I'm misunderstanding your question?)

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Some LCDs (especially on laptops) also update the screen in two passes, in a checkerboard arrangement. I dunno if this is to save power or what, but it can cause some interesting looking effects when scrolling 1-pixel wide stripes.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Oh, yeah, there's a bunch of other weird refresh patterns. The GBA LCD updates it screen in an interlaced manner: even rows then odd. A whole slew of old black-and-white FSTN screens split the screen into top and bottom halves, drawing (e.g.) row 0 and 240, then 1 and 241. I think both are to reduce memory bandwidth requirements.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />These refresh patterns are done to halve the bandwidth, exactly like interlacing normally does. Less motion, less processing, less power draw, less heat, more life.<br /><br />Hsync and Vsync are shorter on signals meant for digital only output device in most cases, again to save bandwidth. The process of sending image is still one pixel at a time from left to right and top to bottom, so you always get tearing and other problems you see on old tech when the conditions are met.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Why couldn't tearing occur on an LCD? As has been pointed out, LCDs are drawn sequentially, line by line. So if you look at the simplest example, the screen goes from solid black to solid white. If this change occurs in the middle of when the screen is redrawn, you get a black line of pixels next to a white line of pixels, which will remain for ~16 ms (assuming 60 Hz refresh rate) until those lines are drawn the next time around.<br /><br />Bonus image:<br /><img src="http://i.imgur.com/oEIjC.gif" alt="Image" />

In other words, it should effectively work like a CRT, where the only way to get tearing is to change the image while the graphics card in the PC is in the middle of a frame, for which there's no fix (other than not doing that).

I am still a fan of allegro's wait_for_vsync() function.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Well, at the very least, you could think of the VSYNC signal as a return to row 0 signal, no matter what display device is doing the drawing.<br />Without this signal, how would the device know what line is the first one on top?<br />It's just basically a RESET signal.<br /><br />And you can think of the HSYNC signal as &quot;display the row I just sent you&quot; signal.<br />Just basically a LATCH signal.<br /><br />When any monitor first starts to receive a video signal, it can't immediately start displaying a picture.<br />It's going to have to measure the time in between two VSYNC pulses to determine the refresh rate, and how many HSYNC pulses there are between two VSYNCs to determine the vertical resolution. Then sort of adjust in between there as more HSYNC pulses are received to set the finer timings (like the relation between visible horizontal line and what not to show during horizontal blanking).<br /><br />Remember, you don't have a synchronous clock signal running down the video cable (although with DVI and later the way the digital signaling works, a synchronous clock is reconstructed to get pixel perfect primary color brightness (no dancing between two horizontally adjacent pixels).<br />wikipedia: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/8b/10b_encoding" class="postlink">8 to 10 bit encoding</a><br /><br /><br />Oh, unrelated, but the checkerboard pattern during scrolling you can get on an LCD is also because a lot of monitors cheat and only use 6-bit color. Then just PWM (pulse width modulate) the last 2 bits by bouncing between the two most similar primary color brightnesses. I can't remember how manufacturers technically distinguish it on the packaging, but I think they rate the monitor as &quot;16 million colors&quot; instead of 16.7 million or something.
