Finally, you also get a book of design/artwork/development pictures.  Cost: 2980 yen (~US$30)<br /><br />b) An actual Famicom cartridge of the game itself. Cost: ~20000 yen (~US$200)<br /><br />The audio layer/library used in the game is the <a href="http://shaw.la.coocan.jp/nsdl/" class="postlink">NES Sound Driver &amp; Library (NSD.Lib)</a>.<br /><br />Any further insights that can be provided (especially by those who are fluent in Japanese) would be greatly appreciated.

Going to guess that it was used just for the extra sound channels.  The music with the vocals that played at the end of the video demo was cool ... it would be awesome if that was actually featured on the cart but I think they faded from real NES audio to an mp3.<br /><br />Maybe this could be considered a very expensive donor cart...  do they at least give you the source code for that price?  haha

From what we can see in the trailer, all we get are auto-scrolling levels with stars moving in crazy patterns that you have to jump and catch. No level maps, no enemies, no power ups...

But instead of shots, it takes the run-and-jump dynamics from a sidescroller for grabbing them, drawing on people's skills at doing this in many games that have floating coins or similar to collect while going through a level.

Do you have a soundcloud or some link with more of your music?<br /><br />I feel like since you speak English (assuming you're Japanese?? no American could have composed that, haha) your brain has to be picked.  Who is the main character?  Is it some well known character, or was she made originally just for the game?  And how did all the artists come together to create it?  How did you get involved?<br /><br />If it's not using anything special about MMC4 (much less MMC5) maybe the creators should get in touch with RetroZone, or collab with this community to fabricate cheaper carts.  Surely they don't need to use donor carts, or cost 20000yen!

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I've updated my initial post to <strong>REMOVE</strong> any mentions of mappers on this game.  The reason I have done that is because I have been told different things from different key people involved in this game's project.  Let me explain what transpired:<br /><br />1. I was initially told by a colleague about the game, and that that it used <a href="http://wiki.nesdev.com/w/index.php/MMC5" class="postlink">MMC5</a>.<br />2. I made the post here.<br />3. hally (one of the musicians/composers for the game) stated above it's <a href="http://wiki.nesdev.com/w/index.php/MMC4" class="postlink">MMC4</a>.<br />4. I check with my colleague, who knows ChibiTech (another musician/composter) personally, who has stated that the game uses MMC5 because, quote: &quot;one of the donor carts you can use for Kira Kira Star Night is Sangokushi 2&quot;.<br /><br />&quot;Sangokushi 2&quot; is too vague -- there are two games with this name that were released in Japan: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romance_of_the_Three_Kingdoms_II" class="postlink">Sangokushi 2</a> from Koei (uses MMC5), and <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDMKH108084" class="postlink">Sangokushi 2 - Haou no Tairiku</a> from Namco (uses <a href="http://wiki.nesdev.com/w/index.php/Namco_163" class="postlink">N163</a>).<br /><br />Furthermore, from the nesdev wiki, MMC4 and MMC5 are <strong>completely register-incompatible</strong>.  MMC4 and N163 are also register-incompatible, as are MMC5 and N163.<br /><br />TL;DR -- Someone somewhere is wrong and I'm not going to continue to get caught in the middle of this.<br /><br />I'm also fairly pissed off at the comments here on nesdev where everyone is bitching/crying over the game itself (&quot;all you do is catch stars?&quot;).  Not a single person so far seems to be focusing on thus supporting the most important part: people are still making games for the Famicom/NES, and that it's fantastic to see any/all types of homebrew.  It doesn't matter if it's being sold for money or not, the point is that there are still great people out there keeping the spirit of the system alive.<br /><br />What I've learned: the next time I announce something of this sort, I will be sure to lock the thread immediately once created.

Read my reply to hally... I actually mean to be constructive, even if I'm kind of irreverent about it <img src="./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" />  Anyway, I think that we should all strike a balance between enthusiasm and encouraging good standards.  I think it's our responsibility to try to come up with ways to provide affordable products - in the end because I want NES homebrew to be big <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />  That was really the crux of my thinking.

This correlates with <a href="http://wiki.nesdev.com/w/index.php/INES_Mapper_004" class="postlink">INES Mapper 004</a> (&quot;mapper #4&quot;), as most of us know.<br /><br />The confusion about what MMC it used was also explained:<br /><br />- hally meant &quot;mapper #4&quot; not MMC4 -- this is an easy/common mistake, lots of people make it, so don't feel bad!  :-)  People assume the INES mapper numbers correlate 1:1 with MMC numbers, which isn't the case: <a href="http://wiki.nesdev.com/w/index.php/List_of_mappers" class="postlink">List of INES mappers</a><br /><br />- The confusion over the game potentially using MMC5 had to do with some of the development pictures/logs/designs, where the developers were considering using MMC5 at one point, but instead chose MMC3.<br /><br />I've also updated the original description of what purchasing choices (a) and (b) come with, since I've been given accurate statements (I misread the machine-translated Japanese of the home page and another site).

Are we forced to praise every little piece of software that's released just because it is? Every release has flaws, and it shouldn't be a crime to point them out, so that maybe the same mistakes won't be repeated in the future and the overall quality of game releases improves. Of course this is very subjective, and not everyone will even agree on what is or isn't a flaw, but it should be OK for everyone to voice their opinions.<br /><br />I felt like it was important to note that, to me, this feels more like an art showcase (pixel art and music, the strong points of this program) than an actual game, because the gameplay itself doesn't look very elaborate. It might appeal to young kids (like shadash's daughter), but for almost everyone else I can see it becoming tiring very quickly. This is my opinion, which doesn't mean I can't appreciate the artistic side of the game and doesn't invalidate contrary opinions.<br /><br />Also, a lot of us are technical guys, so we'll obviously look at the technical aspects of the program... whether the hardware (mapper) was underutilized, the complexity of the game's engine... things like that are expected in a forum full of programmers.<br /><br />Anyway, I sure hope people keep releasing NES games, no matter whether I like them or whether they're free or not. It's always good to know that there are still people interested in the old consoles.
