		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Hey guys, I was wondering if someone would be nice enough to help me burn 2 EPROM chip? I'm planning on trying out NESSerial (arduino MIDI interface) and need to build a simple NES Dev cart to run the FaMi software on the Nintendo and since I never worked with EPROM before and don't really feel like investing in EPROM programmer and eraser as I probably won't need to work with them again in the near future, it would be of great help.
<br />
<br />For those that are not aware, here is the project page, it's pretty interesting and a nice hope for people that can't get their hand on MidiNES!

<br />The ROM image is 40k, so that should be one 32k PRG bank and one 8k CHR Bank. What ROM chips do you have? I will make sure they are compatible with my burner.

<br />
<br />The EPROM I found in my old part bin are 2 x AM27128A.
<br />
<br />Big thanks for even suggesting to help me with this!
<br />
<br />Edit: Another rookie mistake, I realized now that those chips won't be big enough for the 32kbytes and will actually need at least 256 bits chips (I was thinking it was 128kb:)). Another silly question, can a dev cart use one 256k bits for PRG and one 128 bits for CHR?
<br />
<br />I found I also have those EPROM:
<br />
<br />1 x NM27C256Q
<br />1 x TMS 27C256JL
<br />
<br />Would those be compatible with your programmer?

<br />
<br />You need at least a xxx256 (32KB) for the PRG-ROM, and xxx32 (8KB) for the CHR-ROM
<br />
<br />xxx = 27C = EPROM
<br />xxx = 28C = EEPROM
<br />xxx = 28F = Flash (obsolete)
<br />xxx = 29F = Flash
<br />
<br />And yes, you can use any larger EPROM (with the same pin configuration, of course)

If you are using a Repro board from retrousb (<a href="http://www.retrousb.com/product_info.php?cPath=24&amp;products_id=42&amp;osCsid=683ce12c02a9a0177473a315dcc2d2e0" class="postlink">link</a>) then that will be fine. If you are converting a production cart then you will have to ensure there are enough pin holes available and you will need to take care with your rewiring.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">SkinnyV wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">I found I also have those EPROM:<br /><br />1 x NM27C256Q<br />1 x TMS 27C256JL<br /><br />Would those be compatible with your programmer?</div>
<br />
<br />Those should be compatible with my programmer, even with the busted A15 <img src="./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /> I live in the continental US.

As far as I know, no rewiring will be needed as those EPROM match the pin-out of the original maskrom. Idealy, I would like to use one 27c256 for the PRG and one 27C128 for the CHR so I can have another set available for the transfertool rom from NESSerial. Would that create a problem if using 2 different size EPROM with same pin-out?
<br />
<br />And thanks for the other offer guys, I'm in Canada so qbradq is the closest to me:)

<br />Not at all. CHR-ROM in NROM is only 8KB anyway, so even with a 27C128 you'll only use half of the chip (although it's a good idea to white the same data twice and fill the entire chip).

That mean I'll have an extra set of EPROM available to eventually have the transfertool burned to:) I tried to use No Carrier's 9999-in-1 rom tool to try and have the two tools on 1 dev cart but didn't manage yet (There's alot of unused space on the FaMi rom) so I guess I'll have to settle for switching EPROM.
<br />
<br />Let me know qbradq how you want to proceed, I can pre-split the CHR and PRG and send you the EPROM with enough money to ship them back.
