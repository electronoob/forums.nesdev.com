<br />
<br />since we will need to find a solution requiring the hosting of nesdev before August, we should think about what to do about the current contents.
<br />
<br />The current version of phpbb is 2.0 with some custom upgrades (I think) and maybe it time to upgrade to 3.0. I remember that it was said that it would be difficult to move the content to 3.0 so maybe we should find a way to archive to older version.
<br />
<br />Do people thing we should put an effort to convert the current site to some static version?  There exist some script to do so but since the site was modified in some way, it may not work "as-is" and may require some custom code to do it.
<br />
<br />Another solution would be to keep the phpbb 2.0 in a locked state while we start a new forum on 3.0. But I think a static html version would be the most lightway solution.
<br />
<br />What do people think? what would be the best solution?

<br />
<br />In the mean time, HTML dumps suck.  I've seen ugly HTML dumps of wikis, and you end up with a ton of HTML files, many of which duplicate other files, and the whole thing ends up using tons of disk space due to cluster size padding.
<br />I'd rather see plain text post contents, so you can reconstruct the board from those.

This is the sprite oam bug and the Young Indiana Jones quirk, both of which I still don't 100% understand (and apparently neither does anyone else).
<br />
<br />Next, if we could finalize what we've discovered about the MMC5 scanline counter thus far and wikificate it, that'd be another good move.

<br />
<br />I'm fine with it -- all blocking is done manually as you know.  As for the crawl delay, hm, well, I'm more concerned with the rate of network traffic than I am with the fetch intervals or how many concurrent fetches are occurring.
<br />
<br />Would it be easier (and more efficient?) to make a private (moderator-only) dump of the MySQL DB for the forum?  This is something I could make + put up elsewhere (not on Parodius) for download for folks like Tepples to make use of it.  I dunno how much of an undertaking that would require...
<br />
<br />Alternately, Tepples, since the server does have Python on it (2.6.7), you could log in to the ndwiki account and run your Python script from there, storing the results in some directory, then tar -pcf dir.tar dir &amp;&amp; gzip dir.tar and send that off somewhere.  That would keep the HTTP traffic limited to (effectively, not literally) localhost, and the bandwidth/usage would only be associated with the download of dir.tar.gz.

<br />In other words, it'd keep the HTTP traffic on the LAN. I'll keep the ndwiki shell account in mind once I get the forum and wiki crawlers stable.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Well, I could try migrating the existing board to phpBB 3.0 (without messing with the existing board + existing MySQL DB), but I'm not sure about the nesdev theme/skin that's used here.
<br />
<br />Or if you guys want to "start fresh" (everyone having to sign up again, etc.) that's probably also fine but might annoy folks a bit.
<br />
<br />Alternate method:
<br />
<br />1. Find new hosting first (at a new URL/site name)
<br />
<br />2. Lock down nesdev.com/bbs/ to be read-only.  If phpBB can't do this, the best choice of action I can propose is to put up some temporary access limits that return Forbidden to everyone except Tepples' IP.  I can do this without much effort.
<br />
<br />3. Let Tepples run his backup script -- which in this case should probably be run full throttle (i.e. no sleep/delays/etc.).  That way the board would be down as short as possible.
<br />
<br />4. Set up board software + etc. on the new provider -- preferably with migration of usernames/passwords.  For example, at the new host, use phpBB 3.0 but tell it (during the migration process) to try and import all the old users/posts.  (I believe the last time I tried this it worked okay)
<br />
<br />5. Redirect the nesdev.com/bbs/ URL (and other URLs if need be) to the new provider/URL.
<br />
<br />If anything needs to be done in real-time, I can show up on EFnet #nesdev or somewhere similar for the duration of the move if that'd make communication easier.

<br />
<br />Is there a reason to upgrade to phpbb3? If this one is secure enough to have not gotten defaced over the years and works well enough, I don't really see a reason for it to be upgraded...

When I was just starting out learning the NES I considered making topics for a number of questions, but I always searched the forum first, and 99% of the time found that the question had been asked before and answered in detail.
<br />
<br />Heck, whenever I do anything with the NES (infrequently these days...) I still search the forum for quick answers to various questions.
<br />
<br />Even though good resources are available on the wiki and other places, this forum is still an amazing resource.  I'd love to see it maintained without any culling.
<br />
<br />How much space could that possibly take? <img src="./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" />

<br />Valid = not deleted.
<br />
<br />Anyway, I think I have the phpBB scraper working. I've tested it on t=100 through 199, which I chose as a stress test because of a huge music rip request thread in that range. I'll start it over and run it on all topic IDs once we make all forums read-only (which is possible in the admin panel).
<br />
<br />As for the wiki, we can keep on editing that up until my last scrape because I can get the last modified date for all pages, ten at a time, and then go re-scrape any page that's newer than the version I have. I'm saving both the mark-up and the rendered HTML using the MediaWiki API.
<br />
<br />Scraper status as of right now:
<br /><ul><li>wwwThreads: Not yet started </li><li>phpBB 2: Works, needs to be run while frozen </li><li>Wiki: Works for pages, not yet started for images, not yet supporting timestamps </li></ul>
<br />
<br />In any case, there are so many inbound links to nesdev.com, both the front page and the BBS, that I think it'd be wise to permanently arrange for redirection to wherever nesdev.com ends up so that <a href="http://www.w3.org/Provider/Style/URI.html" class="postlink">cool URIs don't change</a>. Or is a video game publisher whose name starts with K behind this?
