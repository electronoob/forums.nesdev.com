You don't need to JMP to a label that's the next line; instead, the CPU is said to "fall through" once it crosses the label. If you know any C or PHP, "falling through" it's like the behavior of a switch statement when you don't break. Sometimes, entire subroutines will "fall through" to other subroutines as part of a tail call.<br /><br />For one thing, I think that's supposed to be a BEQ, not a BNE, as you want it stuck in the loop while the frame count is equal (that is, until it changes).<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">ReadyLoop:<br />&nbsp; LDA Frame<br />Loop:<br />&nbsp; CMP Frame<br />&nbsp; BEQ Loop<br /><br />&nbsp; JMP ReadyLoop<br />;blah blah</div>

<br />So, does the CPU "fall through" to the next line at all times, until it's told to jump somewhere else, where it will begin to fall through from there?
<br />What happens when the CPU gets to the end of the code?
<br />
<br />Sorry for all the rudimentary questions, I'd just like to know exactly what happens at any point in the code.
<br />
<br />Yeah, I do know C and how switch statements work, thanks that helps me understand it more, and I meant BEQ in there <img src="./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" /> .

<br />
<br />But anyway, yes, it runs them in order unless a branch or jump happens. JSR basically tells it to jump somewhere, but upon the RTS, it pulls the last location from the stack and then goes back there and continues on.

<br />The program counter will count into data in the ROM that isn't intended as a program, and the instruction decoder will start interpreting it as garbage instructions. And about 5% of garbage instructions will hang a 6502 CPU.

<br />Real programs will always JMP back at some point, because all programs are loops that repeatedly check input and take actions based on that input, over and over and over.
<br />
<br />However, if you forget to tell the CPU to JMP back, it will just keep going. If there's data (such as level maps, screen layouts, music, whatever) after the code, the CPU will try to execute those as if they were part of the program, which will most likely result in a crash. If it reaches the end of the ROM ($FFFF) without crashing, I believe the program counter wraps back to $0000 (since it's only 16 bits wide), at which point the CPU will try to execute whatever is stored in RAM as a program. Since we usually have variables there, not programs, the chances of crashing are fairly high too. 
<br />
<br />Anyway, at some point it will crash for sure, so you must take care to never let the program counter run free like this. Always program all sections of your games as loops.

But anyway, you'll LDA $2002 in the beginning of each NMI, So you need to PHA before that in the beginning of the NMI, LDA $2002 after, and then PLA before the RTI for that loop I showed you to work.</div>
<br />You can also use BIT $2002 instead of LDA to ack the NMI, this way A doesn't get trashed. Also if the only thing you do in your NMI is to increase a counter, it might be better to actually *not* ack the NMI (in the case of NMI it'll not generate multiple NMIs even if it's not acked). Consider this scenario:
<br />
<br />1) User has turned rendering off to do bulk uploads to PPU, but accidentally/for some reason left NMI on.
<br />2) User is writing the PPU address using $2006.
<br />3) NMI occurs in between the two writes, reading $2002, and thus clearing the address latch, so when the "main code" resumes PPU addr will not be set correctly.
<br />
<br />This is more advanced stuff so OP don't worry if you don't get it, but in general it's good to be aware that concurrency issues like this exist.
<br />
<br />EDIT: Seems like my previous message got completely ignored. Oh well, such is life.

<br />I guess you can do whatever you want with your NMI for now, but later on you'll have to BIT/LDA it OP. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />

<br />I think it only generates another NMI if the MSB of $2000 (the NMI enable bit) is toggled to 0, then to 1 when the NMI hasn't been acknowledged.
