The emu is still a bit buggy, as Yar fly off the screen and across the room.  My cat is currently chasing it.  I hope that yar doesn't launch the cannon at my cat.

It's like that episode of Star Trek: TNG where the holographic Professor Moriarty steps off the holodeck and becomes real, only he didn't really become real but really tricked Captain Picard and Will Riker into thinking he really became real when in reallity they were really all still on the holodeck and talking to non-real holo-clones of the crew, but then got wise to what was really real and tricked Moriarty and his wife (that chick from Dr. Quinn, which was a totally real show BTW, not holo-real like she was in this episode, but really real) into thinking they were on the real ship, when really they were inside another holo-real holodeck on the holodeck Moriarty trapped them in to begin with, but they didn't know, and the then holo-holo-real Moriarty and not really Dr. Quinn chick thought they were really really for real and flying in a real (but in fact holo-holo-real) shuttle to Alpha Centauri? 
<br />
<br />Like that?
<br />
<br />I wounder what would happen if you loaded up the SNES version of Star Trek: TNG into that thing.
<br />
<br />On second thought, you'd better not try it. The Universe might implode on itself <img src="./images/smilies/icon_eek.gif" alt=":shock:" title="Shocked" />
<br />
<br />Go feed your cat.

<br />Even apart from AFD, there have been times when I've had to resort to running nested emulators, such as when the movie-to-AVI of both Nestopia and Nintendulator refused to work with either of my installed lossless video codecs but PocketNES in VisualBoyAdvance handled it fine.

<br />What do you know? Someone else had this idea too (or got it from me). I'm planning an autoplay ai feature for all games in my emulator NESFaCE. I'm sort of wondering what the significance of 4/1 is, and also why it's not written just 4. I also have to say I'm fairly skeptical of this emulator that you've only posted a tiny bit of code for, announced on April 1, and claim will be better than Nestopia. Of course, I'm hoping my emulator too will be better than Nestopia, but I think it will take several years. But hey, if this project is for real, by all means go for it. I welcome the competition.

<br />Ah, I didn't make the connection that 4/1 = April 1 the first time I read this... I'm a little disappointed in myself.
