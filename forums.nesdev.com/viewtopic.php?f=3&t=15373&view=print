		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />GGVm is a porting layer for NES homebrew games. It's similar to an emulator, but a small amount of customization needs to be done for most games. The goal is for it to be a convenient, free, no-strings attached way for an NES homebrew developer to get their game wrapped up and ready to publish on multiple platforms without having to pay anybody or ask for permission.<br /><br />GGVm supports a subset of the NES's full capabilities. This subset was chosen to support the needs of most of today's homebrew developers. This enabled us to complete the project quickly enough to return to creating homebrew games. In addition, this allowed us to take large shortcuts in how the system is emulated, which enables games to run smoothly at 60 fps with little or no stuttering even on somewhat old Android devices. Please read the feature list below to get an idea of what GGVm's capabilities are.<br /><br />Here is the github repository.<br /><a href="https://github.com/gradualgames/ggvm" class="postlink">GGVm on Github</a><br /><br />If you wish to donate to support the development of GGVm, you may paypal the following email address:<br /><!-- e --><a href="mailto:gradualgames@gmail.com">gradualgames@gmail.com</a><!-- e --><br /><br />Here is the Wiki. This is a repository for information about publishing on digital platforms.<br />â€‹<a href="https://github.com/gradualgames/ggvm/wiki" class="postlink">GGVm Wiki</a><br /><br />Here's a demo of Dushlan, an open source NES game, wrapped up in GGVm.

It also minifies the JRE so you're not distributing large chunks of the JRE that are not used by your game.<br /><br />Touch controls for mobile platforms are functional and close to completion.<br /><br />Features and limitations:<br /><ul>-Smooth 60fps play on pc systems up to ~8 years old and on Android phones and tablets up to ~3 years old that I have tested. Running at 60fps on devices as old as iPad 2nd gen.<br />-No input lag added beyond latency already present in the controller subsystem.<br />-Games must not rely on CPU for timing, only nmi (for example, Dushlan had used cpu for gameplay timing---I modified it to use nmis instead)<br />-6502 cpu core. Only write your game ONCE, for the NES!<br />-No real PPU emulation. Split screen capabilities are provided via special registers.<br />-No real APU emulation. Games must write to special GGVm only hardware registers to play music and sfx back from a list that you provide from your game module.<br />-Background sprites may partially hide foreground sprites, assuming bg sprites are solid 8x8 squares of pixels.<br />-You can leave out the iNES header and configure from GGVM, which discourages someone from extracting your rom.<br />-Due to coding audio adapter, you can gut sound-engine. Thus if anyone extracts your ROM, it'll have no audio and they wasted their time.<br />-Mapper 0, 2, and 30 supported. Mapper 4 support is planned.<br />-Live CHR-RAM streaming supported<br />-No undocumented cpu opcodes supported yet, but can add support<br />-Automatic save/restore state<br />-Controller configuration for XBOX 360 and Retrousb controllers, manual config for others<br />-Windowed or fullscreen mode<br /></ul><br />GGVm is always going to be 100% free. The whole point of this project is to allow NES homebrewers to publish on the modern platform of their choice without paying anybody or asking permission of an emulator author. That said, I am not turning away donations in return for volunteering to help adapt games to GGVm.<br /><br />In case you're wondering, GGVm stands for: &quot;Gradual Games Virtual Machine.&quot;

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />By timing dependent I mean free of bugs that are related to timing. I.e. if somehow the NES could change its cpu speed arbitrarily and randomly your game would be robust against that and not crash.<br /><br />But timing involving say, split screens or several split points should be supportable. It's designed to do as little as possible emulating the actual hardware, so each game requires game-specific adapters for the graphics or audio. Super simple games with no split screens will work out of the box.<br /><br />As an example from my own game The Legends of Owlia I had precisely timed empty loops at the end of my constant-timed vblank routine to keep graphics off for 16 scanlines at the top of the screen to hide scrolling updates. For the adaptation to GGVm, I removed all this code from the actual ROM and instead I have an adapter in place that just draws a black rectangle over the top 16 scanlines where the scroll updates are occurring.<br /><br />I saw this as a compromise between working out a contract with a full emulator author and fully rewriting my game for PC. Interestingly enough it seems to support how many other homebrew games were written.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />The benefit for me was I didn't have to ask permission or pay anybody. I'm planning to give ggvm to fellow homebrewers totally unlicensed, so they can distribute on several platforms with only modest effort (usually about an afternoon to a weekend of work to adapt a given game).<br /><br />If somebody comes along and offers a full emulator no strings attached that can push to pc, mac, linux, android, and iOS without changing a line of code, then there'd be no reason to offer ggvm at that point, but to my knowledge this hasn't been done yet.<br /><br />Another benefit is, due to ggvm's design, should any rom-hackers extract the rom from the wrapped up executable, they will have a broken rom: No iNES header. And if they fill in the header, no music engine or data will be there they will have a broken rom and will have wasted their time. All that is of course possible with a real emulator too, but with ggvm it's designed from the start to make it fairly easy to do this and you kinda have to if you want your game fully operational.

So yes, playing sfx at different rates can be supported on a per game basis. That might not be what you meant though, if you meant playing back a sfx without pitch modified but at a different speed (feeding the various parameters through square 1, 2, triangle, noise etc.)...then no, this is not possible. In that case you would have to record several different versions of the sound effect.
