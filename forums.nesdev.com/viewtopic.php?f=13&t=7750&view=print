		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />The phpBB software appears to have a bug -- or probably "a feature" that they thought was clever but is actually quite stupid.
<br />
<br />If you save your forum login/password credentials in your browser, then go to the phpBB configuration screen (for the entire forum), at the very bottom you'll find SMTP configuration details.  Defined there is a mail server, SMTP username (if needed), and SMTP password (if needed).
<br />
<br />The mail server is "localhost" (as it should be), but -- and here's the bug -- the username/password are auto-populated with your forum login/password values.  Yeah well, there is no SMTP user named "koitsu" with my password, so I imagine any mail 
<br />
<br />This is probably happening because the phpBB people are re-using the same HTML form input field name as what's used in the login page.  The browser has no way to differentiate the two when it comes to storing login/password features.
<br />
<br />Why it was working previously but not now:
<br />
<br />Last night (after dealing with the nesdev wiki archival stuff), I noticed that the default timezone on the forum was still set to UTC-8 (we're in PDT right now, which is UTC-7, and this version of phpBB doesn't have DST support).  That option is stored in the same configuration page as the above SMTP details.  I changed it to UTC-7, clicked Submit, and thought nothing of it.  This obviously turned on SMTP authentication (with my forum credentials, which as I said have nothing to do with SMTP AUTH).
<br />
<br />So basically every time someone modifies something in the forum configuration section, they have to remember to clear the SMTP username and password fields before clicking Submit.
<br />
<br />I've gone ahead and done this, so mail notifications should work again.  But what a stupid, stupid, *stupid* bug.
