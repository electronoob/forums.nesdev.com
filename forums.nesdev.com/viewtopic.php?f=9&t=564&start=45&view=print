The outline of the chip is drawn on there (usually in white on a silk-screen layer, but on Nintendo boards it's just the gold).  And there's the little notch drawn on one end, lines up with the chip.  And often the pad for pin 1 will be square also, like kyuusaku said.

I programmed my chips today, and I made sure they were the right ones, and they were put in the right place the right way, and oh, I SPILLED SOLDER ON THE GOLD PINS ON THE CART! AND I CAN'T GET IT OFF! This is probably whats making my cart not do anything. Either that or sucky soldering job. Probably both. But I only spilled a little glob on the pins, but, I did smear it around a bunch. I don't think the pins are touching each other, but I do think that the dirt in the solder is bad! I am so mad, I was excited, and now I'm really bored, because I don't know what to do. Any suggestions? It just shows a blank screen when I put my cart in. I think that my chips are correct, because I did happen to turn it on, and then there was a whole bunch of crap on the screen. But I also think somethings not right, because nothing was working. What's wrong?

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />The problem is, it's not like a blob, it's like someone colored with silver marker on the cart! That's about how thin the layer is. By the way, do any of you have the problem where the solder sticks to the iron instead of just melting? And I need to desolder these chips, because they are soldered so poorly, it's not even funny. I like blobed solder on each one. I made sure the solder wasn't touching any I/O lines, though, because that would be very bad. I also made sure that the pins weren't connected in any way, like the solder from one pin wouldn't be touching the solder from the other. Just to make sure I did things right, you're supposed to just split the data with the copynes software, and write that data to the chips, right? I put it in the way you said, and it doesn't work. But, I'm going to try again, because I did a horrible job soldering. Just I have one question. When I put the chips in, and I start to solder, where should I touch the iron? like at the base of the pin? or what? I know how to solder, I'm just really really bad at it. And I was just wondering if there's a certain way I should do it.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />You need to start with having the tip of the iron clean, and with a thin layer of (shiny) solder on it.  I do that by melting some solder on it and wiping it on a wet sponge.  That way it'll heat the joints faster and prevent the solder from sticking to the iron.
<br />
<br />You should touch the iron to 2 things all at the same time.  The base of the pin, the through-hole pad on the board.  At the same time, touch the solder wire to the pad.  The solder should very quickly flow into the hole and around the pin (don't use too much).
<br />
<br />If it doesn't come out right the first time, and you need to heat it up again you may want to add a bit more solder also.
<br />
<br />Be sure to wash your hands afterwards, be careful, etc.

When I move it up alittle, it melts, turns into a ball, and drips off right away! And I'm pretty sure my cart is done for. I completely wrecked the gold things, I'm pretty sure. I was trying to get the solder off of the thing, it's really scratched up, and I think I burned the plastic. I need a new cart! Does anyone know of any mapper 0 games where I can use the same size chips? And hopefully they're not glob tops... I would be interested to know of NROM games I could use for this, because I truly killed my smb1 cart...

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />It sounds like Celius has gotten a thin layer of solder on the card-edge "fingers" that come in contact with the NES 72-pin connector. I know of no way of completely removing solder once it's gotten on copper-clad (or whatever material they use that stays so shiny).
<br />
<br />The best advice I have is to use something to file it down as much as possible. This will also remove the thin film of rosin that is sometimes left after soldering. Using a soldering iron will only make things worse with something like this. If you apply too much heat you might even lift the trace off the board.
<br />
<br />One thing to check first is whether the pin mattered. In the past when PCs didn't have ZIF sockets for processors, people would sometimes bend/break a pin off the chip and later find that it wasn't important anyway.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Yeah, I sanded most of the solder off, and it should be fine, when i get super glue. I need super glue to glue this one pin that is sticking up alittle. You know how the gold pins are supposed to be flat on the board? Yeah, one lost the glue, and needs to be glued back on before more damage is done! This is how it looks from the side:
<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ______<br />____/_______<br />___________|<br /><br /><br /></div>
<br />
<br />that thing sticking up is the gold pin that lost the glue, and it's getting damage too much, and I need to fix it.
<br />I will do this tomorrow. I always wash my hands after dealing with solder. I hold my breath when I'm actually soldering. I don't want to inhale toxic fumes! But yes, blargg, I used fine sand paper, and most of it came off easily. But there is a dark area where the solder was, it's still a little silver looking, but It should be fine, I hope.

And my stupid soldering iron is so dumb, like, I couldn't tin my iron, the solder would just ball up and fall off, so my tip of my soldering iron wouldn't work, and I couldn't even get solder to go into the pin holes. I need a new cart, there is no hope for this one. I had to solder a gold pin back together, and it is so scratched and ruined, I need a new mapper 0 cart. I wish I could search google for SMB1/Duck Hunt cart no glob tops. I can't because there are no NES game online stores that know what frickin' glob tops are, and they wouldn't know if it has maskroms, or glob tops. It is dumb, I want gamestop to sell NES games again! That was such a stupid move to take out old games at gamestop! I could go look there for an SMB1/Duck Hunt cart that had no gap, and I'd be good! But no, it has to be all dumb and complicated! I am mad! Any NROM games that could use a 27C256 and a 27C512? Because there is really no hope for this one.

<br />Do you mean that when I use a 42 pins 27c322 on a 1J3M-20 pcb using a 36 pins MRom, I can ground the unused pins? Or do I need a multiplexer (74LS139 or 138) to combine the streams? I'd rather use 1 32Mbitter instead of 4 801's.
