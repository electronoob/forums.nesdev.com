<br />That's because it was windows only and the documentation was missing some key pieces.  I have begun rectifying the situation.  I fixed a ton of portability issues with NESHLA and ported it to Linux/Mac OS X/Cygwin.

<br />I have also ported all of the original documentation over to a wiki and filled in a lot of the missing pieces here: <a href="http://bitbucket.org/wookie/neshla/wiki/NESHLA_Programming_Manual" class="postlink">http://bitbucket.org/wookie/neshla/wiki/NESHLA_Programming_Manual</a>

But unless someone can really make that editor and work with all the flavor of asm that people uses, I guess it will not happen unfortunately.

<br />
<br />If any of you guys that have experiance writing code in assembly/NESHLA have any suggestions or feature requests for such an editor I would definately be interested to hear them.
<br />
<br />So far I'm planning on the following for the intial editor:
<br />-Syntax highlighting
<br />-Multidocument tab interface with a treelist of the file hierarchy
<br />-Refactor option that allows for easy renaming of variables/symbols
<br />-Intellisense that displays all the built in NESHLA options as well as any variables/symbols that have been defined.
<br />-Go to definition option that opens the source file and takes you to the line where a function is defined.
<br />-Ability to add descriptions to functions and display the description when a function is called.

<br />
<br />I you stop yourself just for portability than nothing will be done. If people want to use it they will find a way to run it.
<br />
<br />I had the same idea to do it in dot net and wanted to integrate it with my current map editor. I just don't have the time to do it at all and can barely work on my map editor/nes project.
<br />
<br />You should look for <a href="http://www.codeplex.com/ScintillaNET" class="postlink">Scintilla net</a>, a .net wrapper for a code editing component made in C++   Many editors uses the native one for color syntax highlighting, intelisense behavior etc.  I was going to use that.

<br />
<br />For my first attempt I'm just going to stick with a normal RichTextBox control. I have the syntax highlighting proof of concept working pretty good already. I'm glad you pointed me to that control though. If I hit too many problems with the RichTextBox it will be the next thing I try for sure. Thanks for letting me know about it.
