<br />
<br />--------------------------
<br />Howdy all - I come to you in search of answers.
<br />
<br />I have a new personal project that I thought up recently - I want to create a "Disc Changer" for my NES.  That is, I want to create a unit with all of my NES games in it, label facing the user - with a button next to each label.  When the NES on and the button is pressed, I want THAT cartridge to run on the console. 
<br />
<br />Of course, there are some problems with this - each game will need a 72 pin connector of it's own, or hopefully some sort of homemade substitue.  The console itself may lose it's 72 pin connector, and have the outputs for the cartridges wired directly to the board.  
<br />
<br />There are lots of hurdels here, but the main one i'm concerend about is the 72 pin connector - I can't find very much information on the PIECE itself, even though I can find lots of information on replacing it, or "restoring" it by bending the pins back in place.
<br />
<br />Are there any schematics avalible describing how it works?  Do any hardware savvy folks here have any good ideas on how to go about making my own connectors (on the cheap) for the cartridges?  
<br />
<br />Are the TOP LOADER cartridge connector slots avalible for purchase anywhere?  
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />I have one more question too - I'm probably going to need to buy a spare NES (or two) to do this project, but I also have a spare Famicom that i'm not using that I would be willing mod for this - are there any tutorials to modifying/replacing it's connector to work with NES games?
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />If this is too much to ask, i'm sorry - but i'm not sure where to start, and i'm starved for hardware information about the connector itself.

<br />
<br />EDIT:  Might I also suggest putting a 10NES in the cart selector itself &amp; adding some circuitry to execute a BRK command (AKA dropping all PRG data pins for a few cycles).  That way, you can switch w/o turning off power, assuming the next game clears the memory it uses before reading from it...

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />It's simpler than is seems.  A generic ROM's majority of pins can be divided up into 2 different areas:  Address &amp; Data (A &amp; D, Add &amp; Dat, etc).  The NES decides what it wants to look at on Address pins, &amp; it receives the data from said address on the Data pins.
<br />
<br />The NES has generally 2 ROM inputs:  PRG (PRoGram data) &amp; CHR (CHaRacter data).  The PPU accesses the CHR for graphics information &amp; the CPU accesses the PRG for the game itself.
<br />
<br />The EXP (EXPansion) pins led to the unused expansion port on the bottom of front-loading decks.  Nintendo never made any use of this, so it's completely safe to not solder anything there at all.  (It's common practice in the portablizing community to just use 2 old floppy cables as a connector &amp; skip the EXP pins)
<br />
<br />The Security pins lead to a chip called the 10NES, a CIC security chip installed on every licensed Nintendo cartridge.  If you simply desolder one from a common SMB/Duck Hunt cart &amp; keep it in the unit you're building, you can not only skip these pins, but you can also switch between games without shutting off the system, considering the compatibility issue I mentioned above.  Your circuitry would also have to take at least...I'd say...maybe 1/50th of a second to give the CPU time to initiate BRK to $0000, causing another break &amp; so on until a cartridge is inserted.
<br />
<br />(I've never modded a NES before but I've even tested this theory by taking out a cartridge whilst the power still on &amp; inserting another cart, but as I already mentioned that I've yet to mod a NES, the CIC continues to reset the system afterwards)

<br />
<br />And the floppy cable - I think i've seen those before, like you said in portable mods.
<br />
<br />So, what you're telling me is with a little ingnuity and attention, I can use one of these:

<br />
<br />I just want to make sure I have the right thing in mind, because I can probably get some of these fairly cheap, or free with all the old parts at my Uncle's work.
<br />
<br />Edit: Will These work?
<br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.digiconcepts.com/cables_floppy_07.htm">http://www.digiconcepts.com/cables_floppy_07.htm</a><!-- m -->
<br />I can't tell because the angle of the sample photograph. I don't want to order them unless i'm sure.
<br />
<br />This has actually helped a lot. I mean, a lot a lot. I appretiate it, I feel a bit more confident now than I did when I first saw that schematic.

<br />What do you mean?  I'm afraid I don't know what a VCC is, unless it means "video cartridge Changer"
<br />
<br />The idea is that the switch will be on the cartridge changer, and every cartridge in the changer will be connected to it's own 72 pin at all times, and a switch will dictate which connector is being sent to the console.
<br />
<br />What's a VCC though?
<br />
<br />if your definition is the one i found following this sentence, i'm afraid I doubly dont understand your question

<br />I think I can do that - I'll try it on my prototype, but the first version will only be with two or three cartridges, tops - so it might not be a good indicator of the noise level.
<br />
<br />I'd like to get at least 10 "slots" for the games. I might have to settle for less, but that's the goal right now.  I'm still debating about making this a seperate "attachment" and leave the NES in it's origional case, or if I want to integrate the NES hardware into the entire unit.  That's the last step anyawy, but i'm going to draw up some design ideas in illustrator while i'm waiting for the connectors to get here (still not sure if I found a supplier yet, i'm worried he's goingn to send me the wrong one.)

<br />Thanks for this, but i think i've already decided on the floppy cabels - they've been proven to work in the past, they are a lot cheaper, and they are pretyty easy to get ahold of.  And if the wires already in them (the ribbon) hold up, they already come partially wired.
<br />
<br />I might still get one of these for another project though - if it fits, it might be a good alternative to the traditional connector for other projects.

<br />Aww, man...i was hoping you'd have 768 games hooked up in a massive cabinet.   <img src="./images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" alt=":(" title="Sad" />
