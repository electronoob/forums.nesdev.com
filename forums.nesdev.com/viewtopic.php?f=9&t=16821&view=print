		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I recently got my UNROM Flash Board, and am able to program it as long as I only write PRG when I write CHR it says verify OK but I load the programed cart in my Console and there is no CHR, and I think but am not sure, my UNROM board is suppose to have at least 8kb CHR. <br /><br />I can erase PRG but when I try to Erase CHR I get an error, and i have programed my UNROM Board with games that don't have CHR and they work fine.<br /><br />The reason I wanted to make use of CHR on UNROM is because I had this crazy idea to put Super Mario Bros on UNROM, my resulting GAME works in Emulators having 128kb PRG and 8kb CHR on Mapper 2. But when I load it on to the UNROM board all I get is the PRG all though I wrote both PRG and CHR to the Board, and when I load the game I can tell it loaded the PRG and not the CHR becasue it's SMB and it will play with out CHR although Garbled. <br /><br />I did write the PRG First and the CHR second, after having erased it but it doesn't erase CHR I just get an Error when I try it, but it does say Verify OK when I write it but the CHR Doesn't take.. Do the UNROM boards even allow the use of CHR. I don't Know I'm totally new to this. <br /><br />Also I read some where that the INL UNROM NOT self-flashable Boards were made to allow 32kb CHR. But I don't if that is true either.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.infiniteneslives.com/nessupplies.php#UxROM" class="postlink">http://www.infiniteneslives.com/nessupplies.php#UxROM</a>

UNROM doesn't have CHR-ROM, it has CHR-RAM instead.  RAM looses it's data when power is removed (ie no battery backing), so you can't 'flash' RAM.  It must be loaded by the program at boot or run time.
