After adding the velocity variable to the current position, check whether the block(s) at the edge of the player in the direction of the movement are solid, in which case you need to push the character back, like we discussed before.<br /><br />Ejecting from the right should be exactly same as repelling from the ground, while the formula for ejecting from the left or from the ceiling is a bit different, but I'm sure you'll figure it out.</div>Thank you very much tokumaru! <img src="./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /><br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">qbradq wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">Yea, platformer physics can be painful at times.<br /><br />So OP, here's a list of games off the top of my head you can look at that do it right:<br /><br />Zelda II: Adventure of Link, The<br />Super Mario Bro.s<br />Super Mario Bro.s 3<br />Metroid</div>I have metroid but have not played it much.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />For inertia in games you can do this:<br /><br />1. When striking a solid object, zero out velocity<br />2. When trying to stop (I.E. letting off the DPad), you can reduce the velocity toward zero by a fixed amount.<br /><br />In CV1, here's what they got wrong (or at least wrong in my opinion)<br /><br />1. Jumps are not controllable at all<br />2. Difficult to jump horizontally from a standing start<br />3. No acceleration / deceleration while walking<br />4. Collision detection is VERY off. You don't collide with anything from the top, and there's all sorts of bugs with the collision detection they did implement<br /><br />The main thing I don't like about CV1 is the inability to control your jump. That's very bad for a platformer.

I need your help.  I currently have cases numbered 21 through 28.

Then we jmp indirect to byte where the low part of the address was stored which will take us to the case label.<br /><br />There's actually a small bug with the 6502 jmp indirection instruction. From <a href="http://www.obelisk.demon.co.uk/6502/reference.html#JMP" class="postlink">here:</a><br /><br />An original 6502 has does not correctly fetch the target address if the indirect vector falls on a page boundary (e.g. $xxFF where xx is and value from $00 to $FF). In this case fetches the LSB from $xxFF as expected but takes the MSB from $xx00. This is fixed in some later chips like the 65SC02 so for compatibility always ensure the indirect vector is not at the end of the page.</div><br /><br />This is susposed to run animation as character moves across the screen... my sister is an animator. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /><br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">;if left is pressed,<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; lda Next-1<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; jmp +<br />;if right is pressed,<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; lda Next+1<br />+&nbsp; &nbsp;sta NewNext<br /><br />;y contains the case number<br />lda jumptablelow,y<br />sta tempaddress<br />lda jumptablehigh,y<br />sta tempaddress+1<br /><br />jmp &#91;tempaddress&#93; ;&lt;??????????? what do &#91;&#93; mean? :?<br /><br />jumptablehigh:<br />.db &gt;case0, &gt;case0, &gt;case1, &gt;case2, &gt;case2, &gt;case2, &gt;case1, &gt;case0<br />jumptablelow:<br />.db &lt;case0, &lt;case0, &lt;case1, &lt;case2, &lt;case2, &lt;case2, &lt;case1, &lt;case0<br /><br />case0:<br />&nbsp; jsr record ;&lt;--this is just an idea right now<br />&nbsp; bne case2<br /><br />case1:<br />&nbsp; lda Next<br />&nbsp; sta NewNext<br />&nbsp; jmp endCaseJump<br /><br />case2:<br />&nbsp; ;this is just an idea also<br />&nbsp; <br />endCaseJump:<br /><br /></div><br /><br />...So if I modified Kasumi's jump table like this  would this be bad or good?

You need an increment of 8 for that.<br /><br />What I did when I made a scrolling engine (and there's plenty of folks on here with more experience than me) was to keep a copy of both nametable's attribute area in RAM. Then I could make my inserts, then write what I had to the VRAM during NMI.<br /><br />If you're doing whole attribute bytes at once you don't have to do this though. Just calculate all the bytes, then write them and manually increment the VRAM pointer. You might do this with reads, or more efficiently by setting the address before each byte write.

Then I could make my inserts, then write what I had to the VRAM during NMI.</div>  What do you mean by inserts?<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">qbradq wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">If you're doing whole attribute bytes at once you don't have to do this though. Just calculate all the bytes, then write them and manually increment the VRAM pointer. You might do this with reads, or more efficiently by setting the address before each byte write.</div>  AH, <img src="./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /> Setting the address before each byte write will be good... ok! Thank you incredibly much qbradq! <img src="./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /><br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">tepples wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">Tip: If your levels are 12 metatiles tall (as in the GIF example above), you can calculate six bytes of attributes (one for each set of four metatiles in the strip), set the PPU to +32, and write bytes 0 and 4, then 1 and 5, then 2, then 3.</div><div class="quotetitle">qbradq wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">MIND = BLOWN<br /><br />Cool! I never even thought of that <img src="./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /></div>  Thank you tepples... I don't quite understand... but I kind of do.  It will make sense after I attempt what qbradq said.  I do get that you are saying that setting the PPU to +32 could be a possibility for attribute tables.  That's amazing to me! <img src="./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" />  I hope to have my mind blown out too  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_lol.gif" alt=":lol:" title="Laughing" /> ... that seems good to me... thinking.  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_redface.gif" alt=":oops:" title="Embarassed" />

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Say you have prepared a column of attribute data. You want to write it to offsets 0, 8, 16, 24, 32, 40, 48, and 56 in the attribute table. But the PPU has no +8 increment mode, just +1 and +32. What you can do is this:<br /><ol style="list-style-type: decimal"><li>Set the PPU to +32. </li><li>Seek (set the address) to 0 and write the entries for 0 and 32. </li><li>Seek to 8 and write the entries for 8 and 40. </li><li>Seek to 16 and write the entries for 16 and 48. </li><li>Seek to 24 and write the entries for 24 and 56. </li></ol>
