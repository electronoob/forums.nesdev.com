I've fixed the number 19 clipping (I think) and worked a little on the jump - you can no longer get your head stuck in objects - not sure if this fixes the tree issue though..<br /><br />Here's the latest build. Around six more screens, some inventory logic, lives, and few other bits to go.<br /><br /><div class="attachtitle">Attachment:</div><div class="attachcontent">

Super curious what the final game looks like. <br />Looks like Pubby's got a separate thread, so I'll check out that one there.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Man, that was really neat. I loved collecting the worlds and seeing how the level would grow. And it was impressive how many screens you had in the game. Making levels takes more time than people think.<br /><br />I only wish it was a bit harder (I like sadistic games!), and that the player's bounding box was a bit tighter, but other than that it was great.<br /><br />Also, that online emulator was good idea. I tried a few Javascript ones with my game this morning but none of them worked. I'm hoping that's because I used illegal opcodes and not something else.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Thanks for the feedback!<br /><br />I've found two web-based emulators that are passable. The one I typically use is nesbox: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://nesbox.com/emulator">http://nesbox.com/emulator</a><!-- m --> - the project seems to be dying/dead, but it has pretty good support for anything I've ever done. (I've yet to find a JS one that's workable, sadly...) The only real downside is some minor input delay, and some major sound delay. It's generally playable, though.<br /><br />I recently found this one that looks promising too: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://bitbucket.org/tsone/em-fceux">https://bitbucket.org/tsone/em-fceux</a><!-- m --> - my only issue with it is that on my machine, it constantly produces right inputs, making most games extremely hard to play. (I should really file that bug...)

I'm not sure why as I'm not writing anything to the screen there.<br /><br />Anyway, let me know if you play it and have any comments!<br /><br />EDIT: Also, I forgot to mention - this uses shirus NES library (exclusively just the OAM sprite loader, I wrote my own functions for everything else), and also has famitone in the codebase (although it is not used), both of which are wonderful pieces of code!

I do have a couple nitpicks:<br /><br />You already know the coins being uncollectable is a bit off-putting at first, but no big deal especially where you mention it first thing. also made my way to one of the floating disk things. (Also not collectible) and got a little discouraged when that wasn't the goal either. I eventually found the right things though. One thought: Could you have just set the image for those sprites to be empty in your chr file to hide them in a quick-and-dirty way? I tend to let a lot of hacks like that slide when I do things like Ludum Dare - it's a short coding contest; I'm not gonna be maintaining my code for years to come. <br /><br />the other thing - I was kinda sad there was no music or sound. I'll be the first to admit I'm awful at both of those things - I've yet to make a song I've truly liked and my sfx aren't much better. That said, in playing games by others over time I've found any music/sound at all really adds to the game. It's something I'm really sad I didn't get in the Gameboy game I did a while back.<br /><br />That aside, I really enjoyed playing it. <br /><br />I really liked the direction mechanic. The controls took a moment to get used to (my up is now the character's left? What is this madness!? .. then my brain broke) but it made sense and worked. I also really liked the art (esp the main character) - it's really hard to make anything with a 2-3 day limit. My frog looks like a paint blob got in an unfortunate accident, so I have to respect that.<br /><br />Always a pleasure to see more retro games made during these things; thanks for a fun little diversion!
