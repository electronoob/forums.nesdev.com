		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I'm very new to homebrewing, and I just wanted to make sure things work before learning to code SNES games.<br /><br />I downloaded WLA DX as everybody likes that one.<br /><br />I tried to test things out, but I'm not sure how the whole process works.<br /><br />I don't know HOW to use the little compilers to compile codes,<br />everytime I click on it (wla-65816, and the other of these kind of files in it), it displays a command prompt for only a milisecond, I even tried to<br />drag the files of code onto it, and the same thing happens. <br />So I guess I don't understand how to use this or the other stuff.<br /><br />If somebody could tell me how Snes homebrew with WLA DX works step by step, that would help alot.<br />It would especially help if there were videos showing how to use it step by step, or if someone was nice enough or had time to make videos of it, that would help me very much, but thats optional. Or if theres just something I'm doing wrong, or if theres a way that it has to be set up let me know please.<br /><br />I'm just completely new to this, Help is very much appreciated!!

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />That's how every compiler works, they all are command line tools without GUI. You have to specify a number of parameters, input and output files and so on. This usually done through bat or make files to avoid typing these parameters every time. The parameters are all explained in the docs and depends on a certain situation. If you want to have GUI, you will have to setup one, an IDE, by your own - there are many universal IDEs, but that is way more difficult if you don't have such experience and no one hooked it up to WLA yet.<br /><br />I don't think there is a step by step guide for SNES homebrew. There are barely any such guides for any platform, actually. That's because every situation is unique, and you just have to have a lot of general knowledge to be able to handle a situation.<br /><br />However, if you know C by a chance, I can recommend easier way to get started with SNES homebrew, <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/viewtopic.php?f=12&amp;t=8981" class="postlink">PVSnesLib</a>. It uses WLA too, so you will be able to use assembly code.

Syntax will keep looking familiar at least.
