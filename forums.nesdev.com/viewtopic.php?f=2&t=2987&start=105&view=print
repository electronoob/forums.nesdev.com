As for doing it as soon as the player touches the flagpole, I believe that would require some modification to the PlayerEndLevel subroutine...the game timer doesn't actually count down until the star flag object code is activated...and the star flag object code doesn't actually activate until the player object collides with the brick in front of the castle entrance.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">doppelganger wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">And you want to eliminate the brick that keeps the player from walking endlessly?</div><br /><div class="quotetitle">tepples wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">As I understand it, we want to leave the brick there (to trigger the next level), but don't hide Mario's sprite and don't show the black screen with "WORLD 1-2" after act breaks. <em>Super Mario Bros.</em> as it stands has a structure like that of the later <em>Sonic the Hedgehog</em> and <em>Sonic 2</em> for Genesis, which fade to black between acts; hacker wants to approximate <em>Sonic 3</em>. </div><br /><br />Hoo boy.  This would require some significant change in the way the game handles starting a new area, as well as a little modification to the actual game area data (taking out the castle object at the beginning of many areas comes to mind).  The transition from levels -3 to the castle levels in -4 would also have to be taken into consideration, although if I were implementing a hack like this, I would do it the regular way between levels -3 and -4.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">doppelganger wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">And what about the fireworks?</div><br /><div class="quotetitle">tepples wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">Can those be done <em>during</em> the timer countdown?</div>
<br />
<br />Perhaps by moving the fireworks code in RaiseFlagSetoffFWorks (which starts at the label SetOffF) to somewhere in AwardGameTimerPoints, it could be done (also you'd have to send that branch to SetOffF to DrawStarFlag instead).  Though you would then have to deal with how to separate the timer tick sound from the fireworks/gunfire sound, since they both play on the same sound engine and channel.
<br />
<br />Sorry it took me so long to reply to this, but I haven't looked at my own disassembly for a while, and, well, you know how it is when you haven't looked at your own work for a while.  Needless to say, by now it should be obvious that some hacks to SMB will be harder to implement than others.
