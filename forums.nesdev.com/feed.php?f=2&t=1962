The easiest way to run software on the NES is not by directly connecting your PC to a cart, but by programming a chip with the programmer, at the PC side, and then placing that chip on the board.<br /><br />Depending on how often you want to change the thing you are testing, an EPROM emulator, as Memblers said, might be a good choice. The bad part is that they're expensive (more than the programmer), and you'll need two: one for PRG and for CHR, if not using CHR-RAM. If your "rewrite rate" is something more modest, you should go with the EPROM programmer. I use mine with Flash ROMs, not EPROMs. Flash ROMs don't need to be erased, you can just rewrite them (as opposed to EPROMs, that need 20+ minutes of direct UV light to erase), and the writing only takes a few seconds, so rewriting them is pretty quick. It seems that they can be rewritten about 10000 times, wich means that even if you rewrite them several times a day they're likely to last a few years.<br /><br />I decided to get the programmer instead of the emulator(s), mainly because it's cheaper and it's more versatile (can program many different types of chips, even permanently if you wish - the emulator will always be temporary).<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=95">tokumaru</a> — Sun Sep 03, 2006 2:03 pm</p><hr />

Ok. I would like the cheapest method. I am a real noob when it comes to this. I don't want to spend $90, but $5 is fine by me. If you could point me in the direction of somewhere to buy then that would be fantastic. I do have some questions though. How would I connect my PC up to the PCB? Do I need any special hardware to burn the EEPROM?<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=191">WedNESday</a> — Sun Sep 03, 2006 1:24 pm</p><hr />

If you want to connect a PC to a cartridge, something like an EPROM emulator would the way to go.  I've seen one for about $90, which is a bit more expensive than using an EPROM programmer and a couple AT29C256s.  A ROM emulator lets you change the program and re-upload a lot faster though (will have to have 2 emus or use CHR-RAM though if you want gfx).<br /><br />Also there's my Squeedo board, I could sell or loan one for $100 (refundable if a loan, minus paypal fee and/or shipping cost).  Squeedo uses an RS232 port, turn the NES off then on to reset, and upload the program with XMODEM through any terminal prog.<br /><br />CopyNES with a RAM or Flashcart would work well too.  Pricing for the assembled version of my UNROM Flashcart for CopyNES starts at $19 (for no case or CIC).  Works fine with an external chip burner too, if you don't want to desolder an NES cart or get a CopyNES.  Bare PCB = $5.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=10">Memblers</a> — Sat Sep 02, 2006 1:04 pm</p><hr />

What's the quickest way to create a test cart? I don't mind taking a NES cartridge that I have a overwriting the data on it. What would I need to do such a thing? Obviously, I would need to connect the PC up to the cartridge and all that.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=191">WedNESday</a> — Thu Aug 31, 2006 1:18 pm</p><hr />
