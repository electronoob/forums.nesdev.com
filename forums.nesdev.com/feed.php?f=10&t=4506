I checked the wiki right away and didn't saw one at first glance. It's like the previous noise affect the new one, like some counter that is not reset properly and the noise start at a different counter. hmmm..  I could start a new thread about it but I think this one is fine.<br /><br />Edit:<br /><br />I guess it must be related to the shift register.

After doing more testing, the sweep unit had nothing to do with it: I already had the problem but I was not aware of it.<br /><br />It seems to be related to the update of the 4003$/4007$ registers with the previous data. Thanks Celius for pointing me in the right direction!<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3559">Banshaku</a> — Thu Oct 30, 2008 10:27 pm</p><hr />

Hmm... Either my question was so stupid or boring that nobody answered or I didn't explained it properly and a sample would be required.  <br /><br />The last version of the sound driver does have the issue if tested on square 1 . It seems to happens when the pitch goes low for the sound.  It only happens if there is more music that continue on that channel. With the song with no music on channel square 1, the bug doesn't happens.<br /><br />In the code above, I decided to only use the sweep register to reset and the sweep does reset. I tried with value $0 and it worked well. I don't know why 4017$ was used at all (I will need to test it on hardware once my dev kart is ready).  But between the transition from one sound to another, with some specific sounds, I can hear a clicking sound after the reset and for now I cannot figure out why it happens.  I cannot tell if it's a bug with sound emulation or it would happen in hardware too. Until I can test on the real thing, I cannot confirm.  But I guess sound emulation is quite advanced so I guess it would happen.<br /><br />I don't want someone to fix my code, this is my problem and I have fun doing it.  What I would like to know is if other people did have this problem before while playing square sound with sweep and why it did happen, how they resolved it.<br /><br />Thanks in advance for any comments, always appreciated.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3559">Banshaku</a> — Thu Oct 30, 2008 4:21 pm</p><hr />

I have been playing recently with sound fx and the famitracker sound driver.  There was a bug when playing a sound fx with sweep on a square channel, the music would not be restored properly.<br /><br />I found what seems to be some code for resetting the sweep register and the music was now playing normal.  I was happy until I found something else: after reseting the sweep channel, in some specific sounds (maybe low pitch ones), a clicking sound can be heard.  If I remove the code, the clicking sound is gone.<br /><br />This is the code I found in the driver to reset the sweep register:<br /><br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">   lda #$08<br />   sta $4001<br /><br />   lda #$C0<br />   sta $4017<br />   lda #$40<br />   sta $4017<br /></div><br /><br />There is 2 possibilities that I can see:<br /><br />- The code is wrong<br />- This is a maybe known side effect with sweep channels<br /><br />I really what to know the cause of this clicking sound. This is the only thing left to make the squares channels works properly (I hope so...).  I remember reading somewhere about a clicking sound but cannot find where I read that. I could be related but I can't find the message anymore.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3559">Banshaku</a> — Mon Oct 27, 2008 5:23 am</p><hr />
