		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I've been trying to check out Nesicide and some of the sample projects on the project page to see what programming for NES involves (the only non-PC thing I've programmed for previously is TI graphing calculators), but I'm having trouble getting started with the IDE software.  I've tried the following on my desktop (Vista) and my laptop (both XP and Ubuntu 12.04) with the same results.  I downloaded all files from <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/nesicideproject/documents?pli=1" class="postlink">the google download page</a>.<br /><br />1 - Nesicide seems to install without a problem.  In Windows, I install CC65 and Make 3.81 before Nesicide itself, and in Ubuntu I used the 4 Linux packages.<br /><br />2 - If I open one of the sample projects and simply click the Compile Project button, the build fails without any real information why.  Here is the full contents of the Build output window after trying:<br /><br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">Project build started.<br />Building: obj/nes/russian_roulette.chr<br />Constructing 'bank0':<br />&nbsp; Adding: tilesets/titlegfx.png(4096 bytes)<br />&nbsp; Adding: tilesets/gamegfx.png(4096 bytes)<br />Building: obj/nes/russian_roulette.prg<br />make all<br />Build failed.</div><br /><br />3 - If I click the Project Properties button or select it from the Project menu, the entire program immediately crashes with no further feedback.  I've also noticed that the same thing happens if I open the Test Suite dialog and click either of the execute buttons (without actually trying to set up a test)<br /><br /><br />Am I doing something wrong?  I can post any other diagnostic info that would be helpful if someone tells me where to find it.

Sometimes determining what the user meant is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AI-complete" class="postlink">AI-complete</a>. What if, for example, the user is trying to rub the mouse against the screen? Or, to take an example from Star Trek, to shout into the mouse as if it were a microphone?

This is just a build from my git repository so it's absolute &quot;latest&quot;.  The Project Properties dialog has had some bugs that I've long ago fixed.  I tested the russian roulette project that's on the project page with this version and it works fine.  This also fixes the complaint that the &quot;Execute&quot; and &quot;Execute All&quot; buttons should not crash the app if they're pressed in the Test Suite Executive when no test suite XML is loaded.<br /><br />Let me know if there's anything else I can do in terms of getting you going...and keep the feedback coming!  Thanks
