		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Although what Tepples is saying about the delays with PRG /CE are true it wouldn't contribute to the issues you're having with VRAM.  Now there is some similar logic going on with  CHR enable signal A13 and /A13.  /A13 is merely an inverter's output from the CHR A13 signal.  So /A13 comes one gate delay behind A13.  BUT, you still have CHR /RD and /WR controlling /WE and /OE and CHR A13 and /A13 are ALWAYS valid when either /RD or /WR are active.  So the interlock there with /OE and /WE prevent any sort of timing issue from arising on the CHR bus from too fast of memories.
<br />
<br />Also it would be a huge pain to use 16 bit memories.  Technically you should leave all the unused data lines pulled high or low with their own individual pull up/down resistor.  So not only is your memory excessively large because of the extra data lines but you should also have 8 extra resistors on there.  It may very well work with out the resistors, but you could get weird intermittent issues from leaving those inputs floating.  So unless you want the headache stick with 8bit memories.

<br />It's really coming down to a price versus availability issue.

<br />
<br />These look like the a good option to me at $1.50-1.80 ea. I didn't find any 16bit that would even fit the bill for 0.3" DIP.  Granted I didn't look anywhere besides digikey.  You could save ~50 cents if you went soic not worth the hassle IMO though.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Update on powerpak problem, its not sram related, the original 373 chip labeled as 74HC373 had failed or was not really an HC version, I replaced it with a new TI 74HC373 and it works perfect.
<br />I also happened to find a front loader board laying around and noticed it had .3" sram chips, I had only really looked at one other board before and just assumed they all had .6" srams in them, not so apparently, good news for me. 
<br />MB8416-15-SK. Findchips showed some, but not cheap, most say mfg is Fujitsu.
