Does this rule encourage me to hold them from being released until they are submitted to the compo? <br /><br />More specificly:<br />Can entries be posted on the internet as free ROM downloads before the compo ends?<br />Can entries be released in physical form before the compo ends?<br /><br />I would have no problems on waiting or even not releasing the games myself in any form, for the record.

If it is for the anything goes category I don't see it as being a problem, but if it were to be included on the multicart their may be a conflict of interest since the entire competition is funded by the multicart sales.

Thank you <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />IMHO, entrants who plan to make carts of their games should wait until some time after the multicart has shipped. This should be encouraged, if not required, taking in account the fact that this whole thing is supported by the sales of the multicart.

If somebody is working on a larger project that they'd like to put on a cart, they'd probably not entry it in the compo anyways. And if they're working on a smaller project, the chances of them being in a hurry to put it on a cart are low, I'd say. Probably a strong suggestion in this direction would suffice.
