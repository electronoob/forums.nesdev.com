<br />If jargon ever decides to retaliate via MANY proxies, there's nothing stopping him.
<br />
<br />Hopefully he just gets pissed off at the world and blames everyone but himself at his personal forum as usual.

He's very well respected around here, and knows a ton of stuff I would never even think of about the NES. However, he and I have had a difference or two of opinion about what can be considered spam.
<br />
<br />Oh, and probably don't get someone who hates a specific user; they might just delete all that person's posts just because. But generally, these boards are professional and there isn't much obscene language/board drama around here, except towards jargon. Just don't get someone who's going to be a tyrant.

You seem to know what's in the best interest of the users around here, so I'd actually nominate you. Can't Administrators do the same stuff as moderators, just more? If that's the case, this board may not need a moderator, but just another administrator.
