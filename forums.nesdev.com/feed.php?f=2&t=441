Hi, Chris C here.<br /><br />If I could do it over again, I'd use polar coordinates, but at the time, I didn't know how to program them in assembly.<br /><br />So I don't favour rectangular co-ordinates; it was just much easier to fit into the 2-dimensional physics system that I had.<br /><br />But it's nice that people are simply _mentioning_ Solar Wars.  <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><p>Statistics: Posted by Guest — Tue Aug 02, 2005 9:17 am</p><hr />

The only thing I can think of is that translating from polar coordinates to something like a (vx,vy) velocity to move the bullet is tough on the NES.<br /><br />But I doubt that; I mean I've seen ELITE.NES. Maybe lazy coding?<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=160">ravuya</a> — Wed Jul 27, 2005 11:23 pm</p><hr />

Yeah, usually the first shots are wild misses anyways.  So part of the fun is adjusting the aim.  If it was much more intuitive also, the second player would have even more of an advantage, heheh.<br /><br />The bigger complaint for me is usually not having anyone to play against.  I'm hoping tha sometime I can get some kind of SLIP TCP/IP host program working on PC, so it'd playable over the network on Squeedo.  That would be cool.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=10">Memblers</a> — Tue Jul 26, 2005 10:40 pm</p><hr />

In Solar Wars do you shoot a canon? If so, then it would be most logical for it to be polar, since that's what the actual canon uses. If you argue for rectangular, then you're arguing that each player has a computer to convert the horizongal and vertical components to polar. If that's the case, each player would probably just be using a computer that allowed them to enter the coordinates of the target in the first place.<br /><br />One reason polar aiming is probably used for these Artillery Duel-type games (original I played on the Colecovision) is that it can be grasped more easily and shown graphically as the angle of the barrel. There must be a compelling reason since it's otherwise more complex to program a polar user-interface.<br /><br />In the end all that matters is whether it's fun and challenging to aim at your target.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=17">blargg</a> — Tue Jul 26, 2005 8:25 pm</p><hr />

(and in case it isn't painfully obvious, I am that AH.)<br /><br />Addendum: during this discussion, I misunderstood the specific concept of "rectangular" w.r.t. Solar Wars -- that the values are components of the vector.<br /><br />There are a few things that, in practical use, we use rectangular coordinates for.  Identity of location, for one.  (Hell, we abstract the spherical coordinates to rectangular ones every time we look at a cylindrical map projection.)  But (now that I really think about it) we actually use polar abstractions a lot more than HS/college math lets on.  I may say that I'm going 3 feet north and 4 yards west of where I am, but I don't travel that way; I turn straight toward there and walk 5 feet.  (Again, spherical -&gt; rectangular abstraction, but you get my point.)<p>Statistics: Posted by Guest — Tue Jul 26, 2005 7:44 pm</p><hr />

Heard of the name.<br />(20:49:09) Me: Kevin and Kell? Do you mean Kenan?<br />(20:49:14) AH: Nope.<br />(20:49:23) Me: MGS2: Never played it. I didn't like MGS1 that much.<br />(20:49:53) AH: Kevin and Kell. Webcomic by the same guy who draws Safe Havens (and if you get it, On the Fasttrack).<br />(20:49:56) Me: The only snake game I ever got into was nibbles in QBasic.<br />(20:50:03) AH: Hehe, nibbles<br />(20:50:22) AH: Nibbles and Gorilla (2D ballistics for the win)<br />(20:50:55) Me: Gorillas has been ported to the NES, and it is called Solar Wars.<br />(20:51:19) AH: I'm more of a Scorched Earth man myself.<br />(20:51:32) AH: Or Gunbound when I can get to it.<br />(20:51:37) Me: Same thing. Sometime you should grab a friend and try Solar Wars.<br />(20:52:02) AH: Actually, this was this one fun low-gravity space-based one, whose name escapes me.<br />(20:52:26) Me: Solar Wars has about eight or nine skins, each with its own gravity.<br />(20:52:31) AH: Instead of one landscape at the bottom, the playfield was a bunch of planets of sorts.<br />(20:53:15) AH: And the gravity centered around any land masses, rather than leading down.<br />(20:53:28) Me: Interesting.
