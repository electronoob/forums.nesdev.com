I keep wanting you use NSA but its too hard to put all the files in order is there a way to keep them from coming up all jumbled up on the screen?  I want to try p8NES but i dont know how to get it Start.   I know i need to put bin files into bin of Mingw, but i just dont know how to bring the compiler into the PATH of the command prompt.  Can someone give me instruction on how to open p8nes or how to unjumble tiles in NSA.
<br />
<br />Thanks in advance

<br />
<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">cmd<br />cd &quot;C:\path\to\program\&quot;<br /></div>
<br />
<br />I just put that in a .bat file, click on it, then whatever program I want to use I type in the commands to bring it up.

<br />
<br />and heres what it says in the Mingw doc:
<br />If you want to create a Windows executable hello.exe, from a c file called hello.c, try the following:
<br />
<br />   gcc -c hello.c

<br />If that's what it is, be sure to put the Allegro dll file in the directory with the .exe files supplied.  You can find that on the same page as the rest of the Pin Eight tools.

How come whenever i open up some other program in a Nametable arranger i see all their tiles but when i open something i made in yy-chr and saved as a .chr file all i see is just fuzzy data.  i even tried to make a simple design to see if it was just becasue i had to tiles to sort thourgh and still nothing.  Same thing happens when i load it in NGC.  But when i open up the ZELDA.CHR it comes up.  What is wrong with me:(?

<br />
<br />If you see fuzzy data in YY-CHR or 8TED or Tile Layer Pro, then you're probably looking at the file in the wrong format. In 8TED, press F1 a few times to cycle among the formats until the image resolves. Some editors can guess the format based on the file name suffix (.nes, .smc, .gba, etc.), but more generic suffixes (.chr, .bin, etc.) may not be autodetected properly.
<br />
<br />In addition, UNROM and SNROM games, such as <em>Contra</em>, <em>The Legend of Zelda</em>, and <em>Who's Cuter</em>, have CHR RAM instead of CHR ROM, and many such games compress their tile data. Generic tile editors don't support game-specific compression formats; you'll need to find (e.g. on romhacking.net) or develop custom extractors and inserters.

<br />
<br />Try Tile Molester or Tile Layer Pro for importing graphics to NES format (just be sure to set the mode to 2BPP/NES first), those have worked well for me.  You'll need to have some java stuff installed for Tile Molester.

<br />
<br />Of course for you to write to CHR-RAM, you must first HAVE CHR-RAM.  99% of the time this means you can't have any CHR-ROM.  Only a handful of boards have both CHR-ROM and RAM, most only have one.  So you're usually stuck with just one or the other.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />You don't want to put what's in the pattern table to the nametable.  They're two entirely different things.
<br />
<br />The pattern table is the actual graphics.  The pixels that make up each 8x8 tile.  The nametable says what tiles go where on the screen.
<br />
<br />
<br />If it helps to think of it this way... the nametable represents the screen.  Each byte in the nametable specifies which 8x8 tile gets put in the coresponding area on the screen.  Whereas the pattern tables are the tileset being used -- the bytes here are the actual pixels that get drawn when the tile is to be drawn.
<br />
<br />
<br />For example:
<br />
<br />Say the pattern tables contain graphics which represent the alphabet.  tile $00 would have an 8x8 pixel image which looks like an "A"... tile $01 would have an 8x8 image that looks like "B", tile $02 looks like "C", etc
<br />
<br />Then say you want to print "TEST" to the screen.  You would need to write to the nametables to put 4 tiles on the desired area of the screen (one tile for each letter).
<br />
<br />Since:
<br />
<br />$04 = "E"
<br />$12 = "S"
<br />$13 = "T"
<br />
<br />you would want to write "13 04 12 13" to the name tables.  This would indicate that the T, E, S, and T tiles are to be drawn.

<br />What do you mean by "limited ammount"? If you have an 8KB tileset (512 tiles) but are only able to use 256 of them, that's how it works. That's because only 256 tiles can be used to compose the bacground. There are 512 tiles avaliable because (usually) one half is used for the background and the other one for sprites. The name tables can make use of either pattern table, but only one at a time.
<br />
<br />If you want to use more than 256 tiles to compose a screen, you'll need to resort to more complicated tricks.
