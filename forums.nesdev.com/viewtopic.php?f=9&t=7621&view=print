<br />It is a RAM chip that could be read by the VDP/PPU while being written to by the CPU at the same time.
<br />
<br />Were these too expensive, or did they only come in PC compatible pinouts?

<br />We gain this optimization at the expense of being able to efficiently access the VRAM randomly.

<br />Yeah, and so do the Apple II and C64. But these systems also have far less color definition than the NES, which needs to access video memory at 2.7 MHz to keep the pixel pipe fed.
<br />
<br />A mapper that maps, say, a 1 KB window of VRAM into CPU address space would need a <em>lot</em> of pins, on the order of MMC5, so that it can control all of the VRAM's address lines and insert the writes between the PPU's reads.

<br />You know, now that you say that, I've always wondered why they used a 6502 instead of a z80, especially seeing as how their arcade games used them. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" />

<br />
<br />But more likely, a 6502 core takes far less space on the CPU die than a Z80 core, and the space they saved let them put the APU on the same die.

<br />
<br />Also I think that even if you have dual ported SRAM, there is issues if you try to acess the same adress from both sides at the same time.
<br />
<br />The C64 have that "even-odd acess cylces" method to simulate random accessible VRAM, but then the CPU runs at about 0.9 MHz, almost half of the NES, which is really bad.

<br />
<br />Don't forget that the Famicom was originally built to play stuff like "Popeye" (japanese launch title) And was never intended to do the stuff people eventually made it do.

<br />The 68000 did exist at the time. My old book about Microcomputers from 1976 already talks about it
<br />
<br />But it don't mention the price :/
