(How's that for a rationalization).<br />  I had thought about adding a outboard battery backed ram board to a RetroPak NROM but I could only see this as a lot of extra work for a one-off. If Retrousb still carried the MMC1 boards, I would have gone with that. As it stands now i'm sure I can get this cart together with parts on hand, so the budget wins out <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br />Yogi

After comparing the SNROM's CHR Ram footprint to a RetroPak  with NROM configured, I'm sure that a 27c256 should drop-in with only one question mark: Pin 27, A14 on the rom and /W on the ram. The retroPak pulls this high whereas the SNROM cart connects it to CHR /W. So in this case, I think /W should stay at a high with the PPU only doing reads from the CHR memory, but it is a simple matter to cut the trace and tie it high. Of course the 8K bin needs to be mirrored through out the 32K of the '256.<br /><div class="quotetitle">tepples wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"><div class="quotetitle">yogi wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">OK, so CHR ram is really a savings to commercial producers, only one mask PROM onto a generic board</div><br />Expanding on what lidnariq wrote: CHR RAM allows for effects you just can't do with CHR ROM, such as drawing arbitrary shapes in the playfield (Qix, Videomation, Color a Dinosaur, Elite) or compositing at boundaries smaller than a tile (Solstice, Hatris, Cocoron, Battletoads, or any game using text in a proportional font like <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/viewtopic.php?p=121275#p121275" class="postlink">my current project</a>) or even just ultra-fine-grained bank switching (again Battletoads).

My mind set is/was too locked up in the Atari memory model. One of the biggest things I have to remember is: the PPU is a true co-processor, which is quite different to Atari's approach with Antic/Gita's DMA access to a single bus at the expense of CPU cycles. Sega's SMS seems to borrow a bit from Nintendo's approach but is less flexible. All I can say is RESPECT.<br />Yogi

I already have this board halfway converted, all the de-soldering done and a net list of jumpers, but I can see that it would be a lot easier for users to only replace the PRG rom or just get one of INL's boards. ATM I have a socketed SNROM board &amp; 27c010 already, so I can test your port. With your permission,  I'd like to pass your port along to Neil so he can host it if he likes. <br />Yogi

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />@ lidnariq  Thanks for the patched .nes! Works great! 8x padded to a 27c010, popped it in my SNROM devCart and 'tested' for hours! \o/<br /> The SNROM patch is the easiest route for a cajoNES+ cart. Although I intend to finish the (S)NROM cart mod I started, it makes far more sense to patch the code or just code for a SNROM in the first place. There's allot more soldering and you have to build the WRAM controller, so it's not the easiest route but might be useful to someone(?); If you wanted to avoid mapping code but also wanted save data or you patched a NROM game to add saves. Wouldn't be the first time I built a useless project <img src="./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" /><br />Yogi
