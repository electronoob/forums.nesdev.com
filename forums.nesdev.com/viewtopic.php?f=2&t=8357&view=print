		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I just watched the AVGN episode of action 52 and i was wondering if somebody here ever looked at the games programming errors?
<br />
<br />Looking for action 52 on the forum gave a couple of topics about the sound.
<br />And i must say that the sound is pretty good.(intro)
<br />
<br />But the games have some programming errors like : jumping/control problems,dying in mid air,etc.etc.
<br />
<br />Might be ''FUN'' to look at .

<br />And think/gues what programming errors are made.
<br />The great number of space shooters might mean lack of programming skills ?
<br />
<br />In other words : profiling the programmer.

<br />
<br />Also another interesting thing would be the code re-use. It's clear that all the shooters use the same engine, and all the platformers use the same engine, but I suspect the shooter and platformer engines likely share the same H.P. Lovecratfian codebase.

<br />
<br />Right. No beef to the programmers. It's a shame about the mismanagement though.
<br />
<br />I forget the name of it but one of the games had an Indiana Jones looking dude and it played a bit like Prince Of Persia. You could do long jumps and grab up onto ledges. It ALMOST played like a real game except for the overt Action 52 stuff going on like horrible level design and random shit spawning from the roof.
<br />
<br />If they just spent all the time and resources fleshing that out to a real game rather than stringing out 52 abortions it probably would have sold well :/

<br />I think AVGN uses exclusively the real hardware, and I'm pretty sure a few of the 52 games doesn't even boot.

But honestly even if they worked they're still terrible.

The games would need to somehow share much of their code. How much of the code is unique to each game and how much is copypasta?

<br />A lot of the games seem to be very similar to The Games Factory and Klik N Play. That is, a basic game framework that supports a couple of different movement types (such as 8-directional, gravity-based, etc), but with the same system for actors and music, which is common to all games.
<br />

<br />Then probably the best thing I can do for a fan sequel to Action 52 would be to get back to work on President, which would open the door to a bunch of "games" that are essentially level packs for a very SMB1-like engine.
