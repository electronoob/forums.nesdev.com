I think the Everdrive has overtaken the Powerpak on most things. It seems to have a bit better compatibility (according to this anyway <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://krikzz.com/forum/index.php?topic=340.0">http://krikzz.com/forum/index.php?topic=340.0</a><!-- m -->) and it's still supported by the creator and still receives updates unlike the Powerpak. It's also much cheaper and if you don't live in America the shipping fee of the Powerpak will be huge. The Powerpak uses compact flash cards instead of SD and has a slower menu interface than the Everdrive have or so I heard.<br />Finally the Everdrive comes in both 60 and 72 pin versions with cases while the Powerpak is NES only.<br /><br />This is just what I heard, I don't have a Powerpak myself. The Powerpak has an NSF player which the Everdrive doesn't, but that's like the only thing it does better AFAIK.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=6013">Pokun</a> — Wed Feb 26, 2014 12:13 pm</p><hr />
