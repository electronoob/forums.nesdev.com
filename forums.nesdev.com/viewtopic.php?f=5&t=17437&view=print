(Even if I could, it would look really washed-out.)<br /><br />It's only noticeable with Mario on the blue background. It doesn't look strange when he's in front of a green hill or in black levels.<br /><br />It's best seen when tall Mario is in the motion of jumping. The artifacts are less noticeable when you pause the game.<br /><br />Also, I wasn't able to recreate these particular artifacts with the NTSC filter in Nestopia.<br /><br />Do you know what I'm talking about?<br />Also, does every US CRT TV show it like this?<br />Or is there a way to remove these specific kinds of artifacts?

The one labelled &quot;NTSC&quot; is blargg's filter that is available in most emulators.  The other 3 are bisqwit's implementation of a NTSC filter that was discussed in a thread on this forum at one point - it's a fair amount slower and can output in up to 8x res (2048x1920).  The filter only has 3 specific settings (Y, I and Q values) - the left side of my screenshot was with the defaults (0/50/50), right side was with higher I &amp; Q values.

PAL TVs additionally often blend the chroma values of 2 successive scanlines, which NTSC doesn't do.<br /><br />Perhaps someone from PAL-land can chime in with the specific artifacts for Mario.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />The word &quot;Modern&quot; in the instructions may be incorrect phrasing. Every word after &quot;Modern&quot; in that quotation applies to CRT SDTVs with composite input as well. The &quot;sharpness&quot; on the vast majority of TVs has 0% meaning display the input as is and 100% meaning strong edge enhancement. I have read that a small minority of TVs that actually have a negative sharpness setting that performs blur, but I personally have never seen a TV like this. Perhaps I was hedging against older CRT SDTVs: those with only RF in, those older than on-screen menus, and possibly even those old enough to have a pair of VHF and UHF tuning dials. I will review the use of &quot;Modern&quot; once I'm on a PC with the <a href="https://github.com/pinobatch/240p-test-mini/tree/master/nes" class="postlink">240p Test Suite (for NES) repository</a> checked out.

	</div>It has less settings than blargg's because those are essentially the only variables that could be configured in bisqwit's algorithm (it's possible I missed some stuff since I just took the pseudo-code he posted in a forum post and implemented it)<br /><br />As for why blargg's sliders use -1.0 to 1.0, IIRC, it's just because those are the values that blargg's code used internally.
