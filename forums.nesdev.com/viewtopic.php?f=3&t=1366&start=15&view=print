This allows Huge Insect to rotate sprite 0 without rotating the contents of RAM, it simply changes the OAMADDR before rendering.<br /><br /><br />* If I clear OAMADDR when vblank starts I got oam_stress.nes pass, but Huge Insect would hang (no sprite 0 hit).<br /><br />* If I clear OAMADDR at some point point sprite evaluation each scanline, Huge Insect works, but oam_stress.nes fails.<br /><br />Then i tried one more thing. clearing OAMADDR at DMA start... I did this because I recalled some people saying it appeared to be $00 after DMA.<br /><br />When I combined the clearing before DMA with clearing late in the scanline (I do it at dot 256 currently). <strong>all 3 seem to work correctly <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":-)" title="Smile" /></strong><br /><br />So in summary:<br /><br />I don't know if this is correct when compared to actual hardware behavior, but it appears to make things work:<br /><br />Clearing OAMADDR when DMA is initiated and post sprite evaluation every scanline makes all 3 ROMs appear to work.<br />Huge Insect seems to expect that whatever offset pointed to be OAMADDR be considered Sprite 0 when sprite evaluation is occurring.<br /><br />Thoughts? Comments?

Nothing seems to get copied at tick 257 of the pre-render scanline. :/<br /><br />Has it actually ever been seen in practice? Seems like it'd be a pretty bad hw bug since it means setting $2003 to anything &gt;7 without resetting it messes up your first two sprites.<br /><br />Edit: I'll revert the wiki edit until things have been verified.<br /><br />Edit 2: If there's no copying, it seems the changed start address for sprite evaluation might still affect things, since it might change which sprite gets treated as &quot;sprite zero&quot; (and also change the priority between sprites).

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Agreed that nes_stress.nes isn't reliable on hardware, and it may turn out to be an invalid test.<br /><br />But, as far as I understand the test is designed to pass on an idealized version of the NES, in other words, one that behaves the same way, but has more reliable OAM reads. After all, all it is doing is writing random values to OAM and reading them back, this *should* work if the reads and writes are reliable.<br /><br />I imagine it is somewhat akin to when PC emulators simulate a floppy disk, the real thing fails often and requires retries, but almost all emulations (bochs, qemu, etc) simulate an &quot;ideal&quot; floppy drive which never fails.<br /><br />@Ulfalizer: I've never experienced the copying behavior, it was hypothesized by Quietust to explain some of the observed $2003 effecting sprite 0 hits. When I implemented the hypothesized behavior, the ROMs were happy. It is entirely possible that the behavior has another explanation.

And even they don't require it to work properly (because they can't, because it doesn't).<br /><br />If you are making an emulator for gaming, it doesn't matter much how accurate your emulator is with regard to OAM writing/reading. If it's targeted at developers, I would much rather have it work like the real hardware does.<br /><br />Anyway, the point I was trying to make was that this specific test differs from most other blargg's tests in this regard (blargg, too, makes the same point in the thread I linked in the earlier post). Just wanted to make the distinction so people don't get confused.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I did some tracing in Visual 2C02 to figure out what's going on with OAMADDR and sprite evaluation. Turns out to be pretty straightforward. Here's what I added to the PPU register page:<br /><br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">==== Obscure details of OAMADDR ====<br /><br />OAMADDR is set to 0 during each of ticks 257-320 (the sprite tile loading interval) of the pre-render and visible scanlines.<br /><br />The value of OAMADDR when sprite evaluation starts at tick 65 of the visible scanlines will determine where in OAM sprite evaluation starts, and hence which sprite gets treated as sprite 0 as well as relative sprite priority. The first OAM entry to be checked during sprite evaluation is the one starting at OAM&#91;OAMADDR&#93;. If OAMADDR is unaligned and does not point to the y position (first byte) of an OAM entry, then whatever it points to (tile index, attribute, or x coordinate) will be reinterpreted as a y position, and the following bytes will be similarly reinterpreted.<br /><br />Huge Insect might depend on this behavior.</div>
