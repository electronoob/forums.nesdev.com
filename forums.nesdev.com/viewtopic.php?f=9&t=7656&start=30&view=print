Since most games use 16x16 pixel blocks as their basic construction unit, you could go as far as using different banks for each of the 4 quadrants, for a total of 1024 tiles (still far from the 2048 or so that the Genesis/MD can use, specially considering they can be flipped, but it's still good). Tiles that might be used anywhere would have to be repeated in all banks, but that could easily be dealt with by mapping the same bank to all slots when text is necessary.<br /><br />This is a great idea for a way to have more tiles without all the complexity and extra memory required by the MMC5. Of course this would have to be a completely new mapper, not what exactly qbradq wants. But the idea is great, and should definitely be considered by the next person who designs a mapper.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">Then combine that with separate CHR banks for sprites</div>
<br />Just like the MMC5, right? Since sprites are fetched at a very specific time in the scanline, I imagine this isn't very difficult to implement.

<br />
<br />I like the idea of a 100% custom mapper. Memblers is working on this for his cart. I have offered to help him with his cart as well if he wants to use the USB reprogramming stuff I am working on.
<br />
<br /><div class="quotetitle">tokumaru wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">If you're gonna make an exact replica of a mapper, do the FME-7...</div>
<br />
<br />Ok. I respect your and Tepples's opinions. It's a good compromise. I loose the convenience of the scanline counter, but gain more memory functionality.
<br />
<br />Tokumaru, can you write up a demo on using FME-7's CPU interrupts for screen splits? That would be a great start for the documentation. Could you also write a test ROM so we can see which emulators support this properly?
<br />
<br />I will create a memory mapping test ROM including testing 512 KB WRAM (which I doubt any emulator will support). I will make a second to test CHR-RAM support.
<br />
<br />Total memory space available should be 2048 KB PRG-ROM, 256 KB CHR-ROM, 512 KB PRG-RAM. Some compromises might have to be made on these sizes if you wish the software to be emulator-compatible.
<br />
<br />Getting down to implementation thoughts, we will need 64 state bits for CHR banking, 32 state bits for PRG banking, 2 more for mirroring and 16 more for the IRQ states and counters. I will plan on adding a special register for WRAM write protection, which will need 2 more bits. For combinational outputs we will need 8 for CHR banking, 8 for PRG banking and 4 for RAM/ROM enables. That comes out to 136 macro-cells for state keeping. The logic should be very low though.
<br />
<br />The Xilinx XC95144XL is a 144 cell CPLD with 5V-compatible outputs. This could fit the design, I'm not 100% sure though. It's $5.80 in single quantities from DigiKey.
<br />
<br />This is looking good!

<br />Sure, I never used this mapper before but it looks simple enough. The only problem is I don't own an FME-7 devcart, because I really like the only game I own that uses this mapper and I'm not willing to "destroy" it... Does anyone have an FME-7 devcart?

<br />If you can code it in an emulator we can test the other emulators to make sure they all behave the same way. Then I will write the CPLD to behave like the emulator.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Hey, how about using VRC7 without sound? It has almost the same feature set as FME-7 (it cannot bank PRG-ROM into $6000-$7FFF), but it uses single-write registers and an IRQ counter that can act as a cycle counter (max cycles = 256) or a pseudo scanline counter. It also supports one-screen mirroring (either name table).
<br />
<br />It seems like this would be a better solution. The only real feature we would loose is a CPU cycle counter that can handle &gt; 256 cycles. This could easily be worked around with a library.
<br />
<br />Support for PAL systems is flaky though. We would have to somehow signal the mapper IC to use a different CPU clock divider for scanline counting.
<br />
<br />Thoughts?

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />The Konami VRC conters are downright horrible for PAL users.
<br />What they do is count 113, 114, 114, pattern, so that this works flawlessly with NTSC scanlines.
<br />But with a granuarly of 113 + 2/3 cycles on a PAL scanline which is 106 + 9/16, this is a real nightmare to work out.
<br />
<br />And 256 cycles is slightly more than 2 scanlines (on both video standards) not very useful for scanline counting, but it could be great for $4011 streaming.
<br />
<br />In other words, if you use a scanline counter, use a "simple" 16-bit CPU counter instead of the horrible Konami counter (that is, horrible if you has plan for supporting PAL consoles). As tokumaru said, you can (and should) convert from scanlines to CPU cycles with a simple lockup table. The lockup table just have to be changed when switching to PAL/NTSC and that's it.
<br />
<br />PS : About your current project not needing a scanline counter, I edited my older post to show a link to Tepple's demo who do scanline counting with DMC (does not require any mapper).

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Yeah, I agree that making it accessible to new developers is the best thing.  Debugging with serial port hardware is actually pretty decent because you can easily log anything in ASCII format while the game is running to a remote terminal.  The CopyNES software shows that NES code can be single-stepped on the NES (though it emulates the 6502 to do it).  But single stepping the CPU and PPU in an emulator surely is easier to do.  Point is though, there are some debugging features that can be done on hardware that can't be done on an emulator yet.
<br />
<br />PowerPak has a separate ROM for the NES to boot into.  If you're using Flash, presumably you'd just boot into that, with pull-up resistors on the mapper-controlled lines.  My Squeedo redesign (rev3) would be SRAM-based, and boots into a single-byte of ROM which is disabled (tri-stated) by the FPGA after it and RAM are loaded.  All memory accesses will go through the FPGA, which is quite a lot of I/Os, so I doubt this same trick is usable on a smaller sized design.
<br />
<br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">But not everybody is next to a real system all the time. I do a lot of coding on the bus, for example, and carrying an NES, TV, and EPROM emulator around with me wouldn't do. Nor can an EPROM emulator single-step, can it?</div><br /><br />Nah, an EPROM emulator typically is just writable from one side and readable from the other, not much else.  I suppose technically you could code without the system, but without testing it's not as fun.  Luckily (so far) we're still talking about a relatively standard type of mapper, so I have a lot of faith that it would be super easy to support it in any emulator.  I've been using C lately so maybe even I could do it.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">3gengames wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">Maybe this mapper won't be doable in a affordable price range. That's always possible.</div>
<br />
<br />I kinda see what you mean about the price range.  I've sorta gravitated towards doing a design that is either super cheap (the 36 macrocell CPLD one, basically is just a replacement for using some 74xx chips, it just turned out to be far better than I originally thought) and a higher-end one (Squeedo rev3) that you only buy once.  Sorta like Codemasters was getting at with their Aladdin cartridge - buy the mapper once, and the games only cost a couple bucks in parts and plug right in (or do binary release and copy it in).  Then you can sell games for really cheap, or if you really worked your ass off on it and it's a good game, sell for some high price like $20 and you'd net maybe $15 each even after shipping.  Then, your game release isn't an NES cart by itself, it's going to have a much smaller label area for artwork, but is much cheaper to build.  A mid-range sort of hardware would be can be reproduced, but not as cheaply.  Good deal for buying a smaller number of games, but something like Squeedo rev3 would have a better cost/benefit ratio depending on how many games people would want to use it with.
<br />
<br />Squeedo rev3 will be costly to produce and time-consuming to complete.  Compared to the original Squeedo, there is lot more hardware and extreme increase in capability, but I'm still wanting to sell it for the same price that I'd hope could be under $100.  Hard to imagine I can make my money back easily on it, but no one said hardware as a hobby is cheap, heh.  The focus of my part of the design is making the ultimate memory controller for the NES, and not a replacement of the PowerPak, so I won't be doing much mapper emulation though I suppose others could create that if they wanted.  So it's mostly a tool for hardcore hobbyists and musicians, though it seems like it could do pretty well with players if there were good games released that used it.  I'm eager to start on it, but Garage Cart #2 (and the CPLD mapper) come first to supply a little seed money.

<br />Because of emulator support. Nobody will want to program for a mapper they can't test on emulators. Sure you can design a new mapper and try to get emulator authors to implement it, but we're not certain they will want to. Existing mapper are already there and they just work (er... kinda).

<br />FME-7 has built-in WRAM write protect to some degree I just noticed. It has a seperate WRAM enable bit. At boot up $6000-$7FFF would be the first bank of ROM.
<br />
<br />I am working on adding documentation for FME-7 to the Wiki. After that the MMC_NESDEV1 page will not be needed, as ours will be a 100% recreation.

<br />
<br />The FME-7 IRQ has no separate latch for the reload value, unlike the MMC3 scanline counter and the timers in the GBA. When it expires, it is always set to $FFFF. This poses a problem for multiple splits in a frame. Every time the IRQ activates, it is delayed by up to 7 cycles (worst case: INC $FFFF,x). This uncertainty can accumulate over the course of a frame and eventually fail to guarantee that subsequent raster updates are fully in hblank. But it might be possible to dick with the IRQ Counter High Byte and then just let the low byte run free over the course of a frame, sort of like dpcm_split except with easier sync at NMI time.
