<br />If/when I finish a game, I'll probably try to sell it in a nice cart with good artwork, manual and all that shit for the people who really care, but I will probably distribute the ROM also, as these things get distributed anyway.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Money exchange is similar to idea sharing, where the exchange makes all parties better off than before. Bunnyboy and kevtris sell NES development-related items. The money goes to fund further projects of theirs, some related to the NES. The hardware sold is then used by people who freely share their findings and creations made with its help. This benefits everyone. Eliminating hardware exchange would reduce people here to giving it out for free, an unsustainable activity for almost anyone. If and when NES development becomes so active that there are lots of people advertising things and disrupting the atmosphere here, things can be done to address it.

Where were you to complain about advertising when he posted how to buy them?  You even posted in the UFROM thread right after the price list.  Are you only bitching about advertising now because you might actually want Sivak's game?

<br />Well, I don't care about any of those products, because they are not needed at all do develop games for the NES or any other consoles. I wish the CIC would never have been reverse-engineered tough, as there would never have been all this money thing. But well I'll deal with facts and stop complaining if I have to.
<br />In fact I don't care much about Sivak's game more than anyonther, it's just that recently many people have evoqued money related to NESdev when it wasn't the case before, and this highly irritates me.
<br />
<br />Sivak's game doesn't really look really good anyway. He found nothing else than loads of spikes to have difficulty, the hero really looks bland and not cool at all, and the jump seems to be linear instead of parabolic which sounds awfull. Anyway I shouldn't say that because he'll fix those problems and make more money because more peolpe will like the demo if it does looks good due to my advice, something I don't want to happen.
<br />
<br />If at least Sivak would have come to the board as an experienced programmers for years, I could easily have not been bothered about that. But he came unable to write a "hello world" programm less than 2 years ago, and now he wants to sell games to us who naively gave him advice ! Kevtris did not come on the board asking what a resistor is as far as I recall.

<br />Well, you got the point it's not really a problem. I would not bother paying for hardware if I were able to. But I'm really bothered that people are wanting to make non-freeware here. It's like I could say :
<br />"0001010111010101011111101001010100110".
<br />Wow now the string what I wrote about cost $10k. How can you proof that is wrong ? This is proprietary software and all.
<br />
<br />If they want to do paying software I guess that's not really my problem, but the annoyance really comes when the come to show off in a thead that was nothing but blatant advertising.
<br />If it would be like :
<br />"hey I'm going to sell a game blah blah" I just wouldn't have bothered.
<br />
<br />Here it was more like : 
<br />"Look at what I did that is great huh ?"
<br />"Yeah it looks cool"
<br />"Well then you will have to pay to play that HAHAHAHAHA"
<br />
<br />And that really annoyed and angried me. It looks like pure provocation from someone who took 2 years to write some games to act like that in front of people like me and other people on this board too who are getting their much more complete projects to progress slowly for more than 4 years.
<br />
<br />Anyway it's not that much a big deal, I'm not interested at all in that and if other people are it's noe of my buisne$$. Simply, it really frustrates me how blatant the advertising is and the fact people think they can just get money by having fun in coding games because a few people in the world are actually professional game developpers and they think they are one of them. I don't think I'm able to be like one of them, or if I am, I am about 20 years late  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=":wink:" title="Wink" />
<br />
<br />On a last note, is releasing a game that is not ESRB or PEGI licenced commercially legal at all ? I highly doubt that.
<br />
<br />EDIT : And I don't think there has been any homebrew game that was exclusively commercial yet. This should be the very first I guess, or I missed somthing (and I don't care anyway). The garage cart was a compilation of games that could be downloaded for free.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I figure I should weigh in here since I've written and sold a game, and have worked on most of the front AND back end of homebrew stuff for over a decade... going on 13 or so years now.
<br />
<br />I think sivak has all the right in the world to do what he wants with his game.  He's the one that has invested countless hours writing it, shouldn't he get a say in how it's used or released?   Sure it seems like a tease to not release a ROM, but that's his choice and his alone.
<br />
<br />Writing homebrew games is something you do for fun, and if you can make a few bucks off it, cool.  The amount of money he'll make will maybe amount to 20 cents an hour or so if he's lucky.  This definitely isn't a business you'll make a killing in.  If he wants to make a few hundred bucks (if he's lucky) that's cool.  I bet he will use the money and plow it back into NES development, buying tools or something like that to help in the effort.
<br />
<br />I admire his work;  that financial incentive seems to be good enough to keep him producing games.  I've seen almost all other homebrew projects grind to a halt 'cause the author got tired or busy or something.  I am no exception <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":-)" title="Smile" />
<br />
<br />I used the few bucks I made selling ciclones and plowed it back in, buying carts to RE, chips and tools to help in my hobby.  I definitely don't do stuff in the hobby to make money to live off of, and almost every bit I make is plowed back in 100% to advance my knowledge and hobby by buying supplies, tools, books, software, etc.  Reverse engineering stuff is very costly-  you need super expensive tools and equipment, long hours, and a supply of the things to reverse engineer.  
<br />
<br />SO that's my take on it.   
<br />
<br />As for the CIC reverse engineering, it wasn't just me. Don't forget everyone else that contributed to it.  I just spent 3 or 4 weeks of 4-8 hours a day helping that and then writing the code for the CIClone.
<br />
<br />All the information needed to produce a similar CIC clone device is out there now, and theoretically someone could come up with one on their own.  I just had the skillz and tools and patience/perserverence to make it a reality.    I was glad to do it, too.  It gives people a way to make cartridges now without having to rip up existing games, which should bring the cost down on homebrews because carts no longer have to be procured, stripped, and/or modified.
