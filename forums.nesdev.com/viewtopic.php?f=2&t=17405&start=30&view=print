		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I've been thinking and I think coding style is also a factor in this problem. However upon seeing the other posts here I'm seeing this is a cake and eat it too problem. <br /><br />The problem is you are using C and a C based Assembler which prays at the alter of C. But you want the convenience of C but with the speed of Asm, and those two things don't mix. At least not on a 65XX based system <img src="./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" /> Ultimately a C compiler should do what you are saying, it should be capable of sorting and reusing registers and variables as it sees fit. But once you mix asm with C, its 'all bets are off'. Either the language places and decided upon all memory usage, or you do it. You can't really do it half and half. ( unless you're Apple and completely break your language and add a bunch of &quot;here be dragon tags&quot; and make life pain ) <br /><br />The way you solve this on 6502 is you rearrange and solve the problem such that you can keep as much in x,y and A as possible and that you have data you need to refresh stored in convenient locations. doing <br />STA ZP<br />LDA ZP<br />vs<br />LDA XXXX or LDA XXXX,x<br />the second is smaller and faster. In that you don't just optimise your code, you optimise your data to go with it. An assembler won't be able to optimise the data. <br /><br />Tass64 is an optimising assembler, but it won't help you with variable allotment, as its impossible for the assembler to fully know. In the world where you can self mod code it becomes impossible for the assembler to know where you are jumping to. In your case though its 99.98% sure to not self mod. However its ability to union and &quot;sections&quot; would make it somewhat easy to do the &quot;layers&quot; idea I would think. <br /><br />A way to add extra data to variables to define their type is through comments<br />MyVar .byte ? ;&amp;&amp;temp <br />SomeThing .byte ? ;&amp;&amp;unique<br />then the tool could parse all the ;&amp;&amp;temp lines and then change the line accordingly.<br /><br />You're time as a programmer is worth far more than the cost of adding a 128K banked SRAM chip to the cart for the volumes anybody here is going to make, even adding the $4 to the cart cost could easily be passed on to the consumer in a neither here nor there purchase choice. To which having all the extra RAM to make the problem go away is probably the most efficient means of solving it.

Your &quot;spot optimising&quot; puts you in a &quot;all bets are off&quot; category, as it needs to analyse your ASM that is hand made, and make sure its auto generated C doesn't conflict or get trashed by. Modern C/C++ assemblers actually do do this, which is why you have to specify what registers you want, type of register you want etc and they some compiler will say &quot; I see what you are thinking, but no, use these registers here and this for that one and all good&quot; <br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">DRW wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">In general, this would be a mundane issue by simply declaring every local variable in C as static (and doing some macro tricks when it comes to function parameters).

When I was at uni and they are trying to convince us Hey C is not that bad, its 96% as good, here is how you write asm, and then have an example where you use a header that says <tt style="margin-left: 2px; margin-right: 2px; padding:3px; background-color: #3355aa; color: white;">AX = number of items, BX = pointer to items, CX = max depth, DX = result</tt> that a human will typically keep the registers locked to their intended purpose, the compiler will work out when it can reuse registers and avoid not having to save a register when it jumps to the routine and optimise keeping data in registers across all calls generally a lot more often than the humans will. This is something I would expect an average C compiler to do, even say Borland C 5 I would expect it. Maybe going back to say DevPac 2 probably not that well and it will keep it &quot;simple&quot;. Turbo C 128 not a chance.

For example it may optimise a switch statement to be a jump table if it deems it more optimal. to which all the targets are the case statements which it knows about.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />if you have a case where the pointer is read in from a data file, and is thus something it can't determine, then the compiler would have to implement and fall back on strict ABI calling. if the compiler then was happy to trust you to declare all functions with a __stdcall or if it then says __stdcall for everything unless you say __fastcall would be up to the compiler. However how you would know the exact address of a function to put into your data without compiling it all first and having a dummy call to the function so it doesn't get stripped means this basically never actually happens and no compiler would handle it.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Today I learned some production C compilers actually do this. From <a href="http://www.keil.com/support/man/docs/bl51/bl51_overlaying.htm" class="postlink">BL51 Users Guide: Data Overlaying</a>:<br /><br /><blockquote style="margin-left: 1%; padding-left: 1%; border-left: 3px solid #555577;">
The 8051 hardware stack is limited to a maximum of 256 bytes. As such, using stack frames on the 8051 is very wasteful of the limited memory available.<br /><br />The Keil C51 C Compiler works with the LX51 Linker to store function arguments and local variables in fixed memory locations using well-defined names &#40;so that function arguments are easily passed and accessed&#41;. The linker analyzes the structure of the program and creates a call tree which it uses to overlay the data segments containing local variables and function arguments.
