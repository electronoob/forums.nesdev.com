This means that after every single battle I got treated to 7 blasts of those chords. This was the worst part of grinding for the tail, just hearing those chords many, many times an hour for hours on end. You never get to hear the tune play out because you're into a new battle soon after the music starts.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Well, I think you have to blame yourself for grinding which is an annoying thing in itself. I played dozen of RPGs, I never grinded for more than 1h. Exept in DQ games where I had to but I didn't enjoy it. If I really had to I would split the grind session in very little 10 min sessions to make it more supportable.<br /><br />Also nothing prevents you to shut the sound off. FF's music IS epic but it has not been designed to be listend for 4h in a row or something like that. I know what I'm talking about.

That time they gave us the hard version. OMG it is so fricking hard.<br />I spent HOURS leveling up in the lunar sub-terrane, and am quite familiar with your headache. You should see how hard the final boss kicks your ass if you haven't played it. You spend all this time<br />GETTING there from the save point just to be absolutely obliterated in about 5 turns. You almost <em>have</em> to be level 100 to have a chance. Which of course means grinding, for A LONG TIME.

You should just stick to physical attacks. You should also leave Rydia dead, as she's useless for this fight and will just waste other party members' time. Heal every round with Rosa. When the boss does like an earthquake, it means Big Bang will follow in a few seconds, giving you a chance to heal anyone in danger with items if required.<br /><br />Also, grinding is NOT equal to hard. Grinding is easy it is just completely annoying. Annoying is not equal to hard. For example you don't need to do grinding in Battletoads, yet....
