		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Edit: This thread was split from another. It will be used to discuss the development my pong clone. <br />you can get the original game from <a href="http://nesdevcompo.nintendoage.com/files/2014/Category1/pong_198x.zip" class="postlink">here</a><br /><br /><br />Because of the trademark/copyright issues I have to change certain things in game.  I have a few ideas on how I want to do it, but I'm open to any ideas or suggestions. It would also be helpful if you mentioned your likes and dislikes in it's current from.<br /><br /><br /><br />here's my reply to <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/viewtopic.php?p=129006#p129006" class="postlink">tepples and the rest</a>:<br />About pong 198x. I didn't realize it would be a problem, title - first ideas. pawng, pongo, Ping-Pong, or ping. <br /><br />Some of the gfx are based off some memorable nes ones, but they were meant to be. I was going for something like Nintendo use to do( and still do) like having samus and link in Tetris. Or the numerous cameos Mario made, like the ref in mpto and tennis. The sprites were based off of official sprites but I edited all in someway and didn't use the correct pallete.<br /><br />Some of the music is based off of the music from games but I didn't use any nsfs or sheet music. All played or programmed by me in famitracker by ear. I just copied the first 5 or 6 notes of certain memorable themes or songs. They're probably the wrong notes, key or tempo.<br /><br />last the control. I actually researched different solutions for the controls and physics. I actually read a good paper that compared the different control and physics of different games(wish I could find it now). It was like the evolution of pong controls. The early ones handle the physics kind of like me. The ball bounces off the paddle the same wherever it hits. Imagine a billiard ball bouncing off a wall at a 45 degree angle it should bounce off the same every time. You shouldn't be able to change the angle of deflection(unless you turned the paddle) <br /><br />Later games rounded the corner of the paddle and changed the angle of deflection if you hit it with edge of the paddle. That gives the player a little more sense of control. I experimented with having a button that moves the paddle forward and hits the ball earlier. but didn't include it. That would have given a button for the player to mash.<br /><br />I thought the control was pretty good, but I'm sure I have the most practice, a lot of testing. I think it is fun when it gets fast paced and frantic. bet I can get 20-30 hits without missing one.<br />I guess I could have the ball start at a slower speed. it gradually increases the more hits you get. <br />And the gimmicks definitely have a pattern and are fairly predictable.  <br /><br />Sorry for the long reply, and sorry for not participating much. I should have made a thread and asked for some feedback. <br /><br />I can make whatever changes are needed. If there's room and you guys want it - I'd like to see it on the cart. not sure what fair use covers in this parody but I can make 100% original assets and replace any existing problems easily.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />About the pong game:<br />It is unfortunately a legal mine field. When Nintendo and other big corperations are completely invested in the concept and enforcement of &quot;intellectual property&quot;, I fear that even the defense of parody and homage is not enough.<br /><br />of course It's easy to <a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WritingAroundTrademarks" class="postlink">write around trademarks</a>, and trying to guesstimate how pixels or bytes to change to not violate copyrights, but really the best course of action is 100% original assets as much as you can.<br /><br />I'm not an authority on the matter, but If you still want to reference some culture, maybe try some of the homebrew games from the first volume of Action 53, there'll be fewer objections, and the authors are easier to reach to make sure.<br /><br />Edit: Additionally I think continuing to reference Action5<strong><em><span style="text-decoration: underline">2</span></em></strong> could work because that's a piece of crap that no one cares about.

But the control seemed weird to me, the paddle speed too fast, which relates to the last reply. The paddle movement needs to be smooth so accerlation may be a good idea<br /><br /><br />I'm going to remove the gimmicks and work on the controls. I'll probably upload a bare bones version later. I want to get the gameplay and core pong physics dialed in. And get an idea of what you guys find fun and frustrating.<br /><br />Please check out the original, and let me know if you have any ideas or suggestions.

I broke the game itself into mini objectives. That progressively teach the mechanics and gameplay to the player. <br /><br />changes:<br />Removed all Nintendo sprites, and gimmicks associated.<br />Broke the player paddle into 8 segments for collisions, and deflection angle is determined by where the ball hits.<br />Added a acceleration variable for the P1 paddle.<br />Created the mini challenges for the one player game. <br /><br />todo:<br />Add acceleration and 8 segment collision to 2p paddle.(2p still uses the old system )<br />Chose title and fix title screen (Right now I think &quot;Ping Pong Challenge&quot;)<br />More challenges?<br />Finish music/sfx<br /><br /><br />Any ideas or suggestions are welcome, I'll try not to shoot them down too fast.

I passed the first three goals (5 touches, 10 touches, 10 touches with faster ball), but the CPU opponent scored on me before I could pass the fourth (score on the CPU opponent). Then it never got fast again, and the CPU opponent never made a mistake. I was hoping I could confuse the CPU opponent with multiple bounces, but of the eight segments, none appear to produce an extreme enough rebound angle to cause the ball to bounce off both walls.

I have a variable to dumb down <br />the ai, and I was planning on changing it when you have to score on the cpu. Then have the cpu play good when your trying to volley the ball. I think I'm going to take it a step further and change the ai randomly during play of certain challenges or something.<br /><br />Not sure if I'm happy with the angles yet. I'll take your comment into consideration.<br /><br />Also anybody have any opinion of the 2 player mode. Should it just be regular pong(like it is now), or should both players do the challenges? That could work since the players would have to work together to complete the challenges, might be fun.<br /><br />lastly, anybody have any ideas for challenges?
