A little bit less low-level... but using resistors as &quot;extra memory&quot; is still pretty much in the low level category.<br />Hmmm, with some restrictions you might also get the same effect by software:<br />Blank the name table entries when they get scrolled offscreen (eventually with Port 2001h.Bit3=1, downside would be that you don't have a fullscreen picture).<br />Or, assign one BG palette as all-black (or whatever backdrop color you want), and set the color attributes in the 2nd name table to that palette number (downside would be that you could use only 3 BG palettes and only 60 tiles).<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">tokumaru wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">I wouldn't mind adding a 74161 in order to have access to a few more pages of ROM</div><br />I was hoping to get the CPU/APU to toggle the &quot;/IRQ&quot; pin as extra address line (for two 32K banks), but after testing, it seems that the pin is input-only; it doesn't go low even when the APU is generating an IRQ.<br />Another idea would be trying to use an unused PPU address line as extra CPU address line, A12 for example. I haven't tested that, but it might be possible to control the PPU address lines when video is disabled, so one could maybe relocate PRG-ROM to WRAM during that time.<br />Well, and otherwise one could stay with the 32K limit, which is a lot of memory for an 8bit system. Or add some mapping, it'd blow the simple &quot;single-chip&quot; design, but it'd be still &quot;single-memory-chip&quot; - and might allow to get some really impressive graphics &amp; sounds.<br /><br />Is it okay if I assign a mapper number to the board? And (re-)define the &quot;Four Screen&quot; bit in the iNES header as &quot;One Screen&quot; bit for that mapper (as described above)?<br />(For now without recursing possible extensions like pull-down resistors or exceeding the 32K limit. If they get ever implemented they could share the same mapper number, as far as they don't conflict with the old 32K definition, or use another new mapper number - or stay with NROM or AOROM when exact emulation of the hardware limits isn't important).<br /><br />Some potentionally free mapper numbers can be found here <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://kevtris.org/Projects/console/mappers/index.html">http://kevtris.org/Projects/console/mappers/index.html</a><!-- m --> but after googling for <strong>nes &quot;mapper xxx&quot;</strong> (xxx=number), it turned out that most of them are used for this or that stuff. One number (maybe the last in the 8bit space) that seems to be still free is &quot;218&quot; so I guess I could use that one, right?<br /><br />Btw. for the NES 2.0 mapper numbers 256..4095, I think the <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://wiki.nesdev.com/w/index.php/NES_2.0">http://wiki.nesdev.com/w/index.php/NES_2.0</a><!-- m --> page should contain some guidelines on how to use/invent new numbers.

On the other hand, the CIC isn't &quot;directly&quot; part of the mapper. On a Famicom it'd work without CIC, same on a modded NES (which every NES user <em>should</em> have). And finally one could use that CIC-stunning circuits - don't know if newer consoles are protected against that trick, but at least that trick did exist &amp; work with the older NES consoles - that could be implemented via transistors &amp; capacitors without needing a second chip.

Otherwise it should be super-simple to make a transistor circuit that generates the pulses.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">Dwedit wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">I'd say don't redefine the &quot;four screen&quot; bit. It is already clearly defined, and any existing emulator that sees the &quot;four screen&quot; bit will provide 4 Screen VRAM.</div><br />Would be no problem. If the emulator does support the mapper then it can interprete the header bit accordingly. And if it does't support the mapper then it won't work anyways, no matter if it sees the bit has one-screen or four-screen flag.<br /><br />The other options would be assigning separate mapper number for each configuration, but I think that'd be some overkill.<br /><br />Or, to allocate a new one-screen flag in the NES 2.0 header, like in bitX of byte 0Yh or so. But then the name table mapping would be controlled by 3 separate bits scattered all across the header (byte 6.bit0, byte 6.bit3, byte 0Yh.bitX). That'd be kinda messy, too. I think doing that would make sense only if more mappers need one-screen BLK0 and BLK1 mappings - which might be actually be the case (as UNIF is explicitly supporting that configuration). Are there any cartridges that are using that feature?

Or, even do both.<br /><br />Use 60-pins cartridge that way you don't need CIC on the cartridge, you can use CIC only on 60-to-72 adapter, so you only need one CIC instead of more than one.

A platformer is quite needing in tiles as you need at least several tiles for the main character and several enemies and power ups. Other game genres can be done with less tiles.<br /><br />Also of course it's not possible to look as good as Kirby's adventure, but I meant it's possible to look good enough so that it's not too obvious the game uses a single chip.<br />If people's reaction will be &quot;hey this looks good thinking this game is the only sinlge NES/FC game that uses a single chip&quot;, then I'll have failed. However if their rections is &quot;it looks fairly standard&quot; then I'll be delighted.<br /><br />And another trick to bypass the 64 tiles limitation would be re-writing tiles midframe. Of course it becomes a tradeoff between the extra blanking scanlines in the middle of the screen and the # of tiles being rewritten. Something like 4 more tiles could be a life saver in several situations. However I didn't plan to use that in my game.

During rendering it could be controlled easily with the $2000 register, but during VBlank...</div><br />Now that I have given some more thought to this, expanding this mapper in any way that requires more components would make little sense, because the whole novelty here is the simplicity. If you're gonna add more chips you might just as well use a more conventional mapper. It would be interesting if something could be worked out using the CHR pins though.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">it's just the way you said it sounded like &quot;game = (scrolling) platformer&quot; for you.</div><br />It's my favorite game style, so it's only natural that it's the first one I think about. =) I do enjoy other kinds of games though, I just can't play RPGs.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">A platformer is quite needing in tiles as you need at least several tiles for the main character and several enemies and power ups. Other game genres can be done with less tiles.</div><br />Yeah, you'd have to keep power up and enemy kinds to a minimum, and make them symmetric whenever possible to take advantage of sprite flipping. Scrolling platformers might not be the most fitting for this mapper, but I believe that a decent one is perfectly possible.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">&quot;hey this looks good thinking this game is the only sinlge NES/FC game that uses a single chip&quot;</div><br />Most people don't know what having a single chip in the cart means... XD<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">And another trick to bypass the 64 tiles limitation would be re-writing tiles midframe.</div><br />Another option, that doesn't require messing with the rendering process, is blanking one entire background palette (so you only get 3 for the game) and using that palette for a few scanlines at the top and bottom of the screen. Every 8 scanlines buys you 2 tiles, so if you reduce the vertical resolution to 192 (like in many other platforms) you get 12 extra tiles. Vertical scrolling becomes pretty much impossible though.
