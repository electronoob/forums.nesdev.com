So yeah, A16 is usunsed and doesn't go to the WRAM enable. That's all I wanted to know, thank you very much.<br /><br />EDIT : Oh and does anyone have a SJROM board ? Like SAROM, the upper CHR line is unused, and could potentially be used for WRAM enable. Although if it's not on SAROM I doubt it is on SJROM but who knowns.<br /><br />EDIT 2 : Never mind I checked bootgod database, and the A16 line isn't connected on SJROM.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=38">Bregalad</a> — Sun Oct 17, 2010 1:58 am</p><hr />

You should check pins 9-11, especially pin 11. Pins 9 and 10 (A14 and A15) very likely go to pins on the CHR-ROM, that are unused by DW, but are here for support up to 64kb CHR-ROM.<br /><br />Pin 11 (A16) however, is what I'd want you to look where it leads... On MMC1 boards with 128kb CHR-ROM this is A16, on SUROM it is the main 256k page switch and on SNROM it is a second WRAM enable.... so I'm very curious about if it is used on SAROM.<br /><br />I don't think revisions matters in any way, usually they just changed the layout of the traces and componant, not the shematics. The only place I remember they changed something on the same board was that they added a capactiy on SNROM-04 and + to make saves more reliable than SNROM-03 and -<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"><br />a ground pulls low, right?

Unused inputs are usually pulled low or high (ground or VCC respecively), while unused outputs should be left floating.<br /><br />EDIT / PS : The fact that A16 was sometimes connected to WRAM /CE was already doccumented, at least from Kevtirs's site, and even the nesdev wiki.

You should check where MMC1's CHR out pins are connected. I guess the low 4 should be connected to CHR-ROM (obviously), although DW1 only uses two of them (16k CHR-ROM), I'd assume the cart to support up to 64k CHR-ROM (using up 4 adress lines) because all other Nintendo boards does that (they only got custom pinout for mask ROMs of 128k or above).<br /><br />So there is a free adress line (A16) which may be connected to WRAM /CE like on SNROM, or that might just be left unconnected.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"><br />Wow, still finding stuff out every day is pretty cool.<br /></div><br />I agree.

Thanks for clarifying yourself, chykn.<br />So since WRAM /CE is connected to CHR-A16 on SNROM boards, this means it's possible to disable WRAM by writing $1x on the CHR-ROM select registers. This feature has never been documented anywhere - they said that writing $1x on the PRG-ROM select register will disable SRAM internally in the MMC1 (the MMC1 is only connected to the positive CE pin). So I guess in the very particular case of SNROM, you have both WRAM enable bits instead of just one like other MMC1 boards ?<br /><br />And what about SOROM and SAROM ? Those have not all CHR-selct pins used and have SRAM too. I'm pretty sure the negative /CE pin on SOROM is used by the SRAM chip select circuitery (connected to CHR-A15 directly for one chip, and though a transistor-inverter for the second chip). I don't know on SAROM though. Anyone with a DW1 card could check this and upload the wiki ? Thanks.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=38">Bregalad</a> — Sat Oct 16, 2010 2:05 am</p><hr />

Yeah, okay I get it.

I left out step 3 as shown here.<br /><ul>1. Follow the 256K chip guide to replace the mask ROM with a flash chip<br />2. Cut the trace going from MMC1 pin 11 to WRAM pin 20<br /><strong>3. Cut the trace going from MMC1 pin 4 to PRG ROM pin 1</strong><br />4. Connect WRAM pin 20 to GND<br />5. Connect MMC1 pin 11 to PRG ROM pin 1<br />(MMC1 pin 4 should already be connected to PRG ROM pin 2 according to the guide)<br /></ul><br /><em>(I did this conversion on an SNROM-05 board, have not tested others)</em><br /><br />I can see why you thought that the WRAM /CE was tied to ground.  From what I've seen on the oscilloscope, the SNROM games I listed above never seem to set MMC1 CHR-A16 high.  This means you could probably get away with converting the cart from SNROM-&gt;SUROM then using it to play both 256K and 512K ROMs.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=4242">chykn</a> — Fri Oct 15, 2010 6:04 pm</p><hr />

Ok since it's not for a repro, I'm going to tell more details.<br /><br />I'm pretty sure the only difference between SNROM and SUROM is that PRG-A18 is connected to MMC1's CHR-A16 (it's A16, not A19 like you said). On SNROM, MMC1's CHR-A16 is just left unconnected, and I'm pretty sure the pin that would hold A18 on a Nintendo's mask ROM is just tied to +5V or something in the like.<br />I'm pretty sure all SNROM games would work just fine on a SUROM board without altering Nintendo's mask ROM (by disoldering them without damaging them and soldering them back on a SUROM board) - Nintendo just used SNROM because they didn't think about the A18 trick in 1987.<br /><br />I don't know what is this think about the WRAM, but it's functionality is identical in both board so I doubt you'd need to touch the WRAM in any way.<br /><br />And yes, you should set both CHR-registers to the same value. Or even better, set the CHR-switching mode to 8k, and then only use the first CHR-Register.<br />If you set both CHR-registers to different values, your PRG-ROM's A18 will be switched twice per scanline in the same fashion as MMC3's scanline counter (in the case of BG using table #0 and sprites  using table #1, switching once per line, in the other case, switching about 36 times). <br /><br />You COULD abuse this in a game to do a "software" MMC3 scanline counter but it's probably not the best method, and probably won't work in any emulator.<br /><br />EDIT : in fact this method isn't that stupid... considering that the MMC1 has no scanline counter of any kind, and that doing it with DPCM is complex and annoying... why not abuse this behavior ?<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=38">Bregalad</a> — Fri Oct 15, 2010 2:10 pm</p><hr />

The other day I took an Ultima Exodus cart and rewired it with a 39SF040 burned with Dragon Warrior 4.  The trace between MMC1 pin 11 and WRAM pin 20 must be cut.  MMC1 pin 11 should then be tied to A18 (pin 1) on your 4Mb EEPROM chip.  Tie WRAM pin 20 to GND.  I'm not sure if simply tying EEPROM pin A18 to MMC1 pin 11 would work.  If the game happens to be using the upper 256KB section of the chip, usage of the WRAM would be disabled since /CE would be high.  I played it safe and cut the trace.  Fired right up and played without issue.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=4242">chykn</a> — Fri Oct 15, 2010 1:17 pm</p><hr />

So basically use the 256K chip guide and thats how the pins should be? Okay that makes it easier to understand. I am not that good with electronics and just want to check before I start going in and hacking up my zelda game....And nah I'm not making a repro of any kind. Maybe to test to make sure it works, and thats a good idea for playing, but it's going to be a development cart.....I just have never needed to rewire a board and it will really be a bummer to kill a zelda, which I only have 2 of and this board is good for development of really cool stuff and I decided to develop on it.<br /><br /><br /><br />So yeah, A16 through A19 on the CHR bank select pins on the MMC1 can tie to A19. I get that. I am just wondering, if it is in 2x 4K banks for MMC1, do both registers need to set A18 high? And also, since there is one register on the MMC1, if you set it so that one bank of 16K isn't movable, then I am guessing bank 0  will be put in that spot automatically? Is that correct?<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=4311">3gengames</a> — Fri Oct 15, 2010 12:01 pm</p><hr />
