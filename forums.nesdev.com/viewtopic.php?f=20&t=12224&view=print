As for the case, I believe the ones sold by krikzz himself do fit all Game Boys, but I'm not sure. Will check later on my GB Pocket.<br /><br />EDIT: Just looked at a photo on krikzz's and  you're right, the case is similar to a GBC one. I've seen people using classic cases though.

I think the only thing that didn't run was those NES ROMs.<br /><br />When I bought mine, it didn't come with a shell (you had to hack up your own), but the ones they currently offer do have a small slot for the DMG's power switch.<br /><br />PS. Does not fit in Game Boy Micro, since the Micro only supports GBA carts <img src="./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" /> And GB Pocket doesn't need a notch, just the DMG.

There is a cutout on the back of the case that allows the power button tab the room it needs.<br /><br />The rules for homebrew are simple, if the game uses no MBC or the official MBC 1, 2, 3 or 5 (or <strong>compatible </strong> clone or emulator, it should work.  If it uses custom hardware then it won't.  When you turn the system on, it boots to the menu after displaying the Nintendo(R) or GAME BOY Nintendo(R) logo.  Then you select a game and the system reboots (except on Super Game Boy), displaying the logo again.  That way homebrews should have no issues with the protection check, just like regular games.

That's one thing that makes old MBC5 based flashcarts still useful.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Yeah it's said to support only official memory controllers between MBC1-5 except MBC3+RTC. I think that as long as you make your homebrew within specs and fix the header checksum, there should be no difference between it and a retail ROM.<br /><br />Even if the initial state of the Game Boy are messed with by the Everdrive, a game probably shouldn't rely on their initial values anyway, since those values differ a bit between Game Boy models.

(in fact this is one thing that annoys me from the Everdrive flashcarts, since they have a firmware they initialize the hardware before the game starts, so if you have an initialization bug in your game you will not be able to catch it using them).
