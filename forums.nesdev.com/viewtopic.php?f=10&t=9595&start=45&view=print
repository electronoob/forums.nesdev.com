There it looked bad, because everything in the game always moved at 1 (or 2 or other small integers) pixels per vsync, and having everything pause on every 6th frame was very visible.<br /><br />I could easily believe it would be fine if you used fractional velocities or didn't skip all objects' logic at the same time.

Each animation is just a list of sprites to use, and the speed at which the animation plays. So each actor is given a list of animations it can use, and by &quot;animation number&quot;, I just meant the index into this list. For example, for a player actor, I can have animation #0 be the player standing, animation #1 be a walking animation, animation #2 be a climbing animation, etc.

Or, why doesn't the frame rate match the mains frequency in Brazil? Or, maybe I'm getting things mixed up. NTSC and PAL refer to ways of encoding colors in a frame, not the frequency of the frames, right?

And for this, yes, most games are expected to run at the refresh rate of the region's respective analog video standard.
