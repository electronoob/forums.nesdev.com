So don't forget to disable NMI and IRQ.  Any needed code that would normally be in the ROM, you would assemble an alternate version of it with the origin at a location in RAM.  Then copy it into RAM before running it.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I have just bought a SNES PowerPak this week for use on my Super Famicom. I have spent all day trying to get it to work, but nothing loads. I just get the black screen of death every time. I read in lots of places that it works with the Super Famicom, but now I am wondering if (U) Roms do not work at all? I also couldn't get any (J) Roms to work either though.<br /><br />I have the latest firmware as of August 2012 and have copied over a selection of Roms. Whereas on the YouTube videos when they pick a game it boots up, on my one everything just goes black, and it stays that way for 15 minutes before I turn it off.<br /><br />I am pretty sure the PowerPak is ok because the first screens load. The Super Famicom works with normal cartridge games. I thought the Roms might be regionally locked, but: a) I thought this wouldn't be an issue; and b) as I said, even (J) Roms do not work. The CF card (2GB) came with the PowerPak.<br /><br />I think I really need some help off someone who has a Super Famicom and a SNES PowerPak. If you could please share your experiences of it, that would be most welcome. Thank you in advance.

I've heard some problems are related to the CF Card reader doing something that the PowerPAK doesn't like. You could try using a different CF card interface, different PC, etc to put the roms on the CF card and you may have better luck. The Super Famicom can play (U) and (J) roms just fine.

I have tried preparing the files from XP and 7, but it did not make a difference.</div><br />In addition to MottZilla's advice, I'd recommend trying a different brand of CF card and/or reformatting your CF card (with FAT32) and/or reorganizing your files in such a way that the &quot;POWERPAK&quot; system directory is at the beginning of the file system (i. e., copy the system directory to your empty card first, and only then start adding ROM directories). Also, you could try setting DMA=0 in CONFIG.TXT. Though I doubt it'll actually make much of a difference, it's still worth a try. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":-)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />Meanwhile, I'm proud to announce that the SPC player has been redesigned - apart from the cool fact that it now actually <em>works</em>, too! <img src="./images/smilies/icon_lol.gif" alt=":lol:" title="Laughing" /> (Thanks, blargg!)<br /><br /><img src="http://www.manuloewe.de/snestuff/powerpak/firmware-200beta-WIP120808-1.jpg" alt="Image" /><br /><br /><br />Another fact worth mentioning is that v2.00 works flawlessly on 1/1/1 systems (no HDMA &lt;&gt; DMA crashing!). Here's a shot of my beloved 1990 Super Famicom passing the SDRAM test:<br /><br /><img src="http://www.manuloewe.de/snestuff/powerpak/firmware-200beta-WIP120808-2.jpg" alt="Image" /><br /><br /><br />Until ... soon! <img src="./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" />

Try formatting the CF card to Fat 32, try using a different CF Card Reader. It does appear like it is having CF card problems and the PowerPAK itself should be ok.

With some other games, not so. Is it the case that any given game needs to support battery back-up in order for the save to work? Can the powerpak save states like on an emulator?<br /><br />I've spent an hour reading online but haven't found anything definitive. Seems states can now be saved on NES version, but not yet SNES.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />The problem with implementing realtime save states on the SNES is that getting the internal state of the entire system is quite difficult, if not impossible. For example, the S-CPU doesn't have direct access to the SPC's RAM (or the S-SMP state for that matter). And the situation is even worse with the PPU and DMA controller as some of their registers are write-only AFAIK.<br /><br />I began looking into implementing this feature on a different flash cart a year or two ago, and quickly came to the conclusion that it just wouldn't work. It would've been cool if it was possible though - it's a feature I appreciate a lot when playing GBA games with the Supercard.

Otherwise, I am very impressed with the PowerPAK so far.<br /><br />I spent last weekend playing Mottzilla's cut of BS Zelda through the PowerPAK, which worked very well. Having never played the original Zelda, the 16-bit make-over was the pleasure to play through, a true work of art.<br /><br />Got me thinking that a 16-bit version of the original Metroid, in the style of Super Metroid, would also be amazing (if unlikely to ever happen).
