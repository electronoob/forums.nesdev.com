AFAIK the soundtrack is identical between the two systems, but -- and I'm being incredibly pedantic here (word-wise), so feel free to slap me -- I don't think the PS/PSX version is just &quot;a recording of the arcade version&quot;, as the audio quality is very clear/crisp.  It's more likely that it's a recording from whatever the true/original sound source was.<br /><br />I played the Saturn version back in the mid-90s and I remember it being on par with the PS/PSX (soundtrack and quality-wise).<br /></div><br /><br />That's funny, because while I've never owned a Sexy Parodius board, I do have the first two Parodius arcade games, and especially on Gokujou Parodius, I could tell a clear difference in the sound of the music when I plugged in the PCB, compared to the Saturn version on Parodius Deluxe Pack - the arcade PCB just sounded much, much clearer, with the sound coming directly from the sound chip. I believe it's based on sample playback, though, similar to the SNES chip.

A sample bank can also be compressed, such as BRR (Super NES), IMA (Nintendo DS), the sample compression modes in XM and <a href="https://wiki.multimedia.cx/index.php/Impulse_Tracker#IT214_sample_compression" class="postlink">IT</a>, and <a href="https://fileinfo.com/extension/mo3" class="postlink">MO3</a>. I envision a format similar to OpenMPT's MPTM except using Opus-compressed samples.<br /><br />Another wrinkle is on systems with limited RAM. The samples used by a piece might be more challenging to keep in RAM than a second's worth of compressed audio and 100 ms of decompressed audio.

Consider that downloadable Wii games were limited to about 40 MB.

But games where it is a significant percentage are going to be explicitly music-centered and probably can't afford to use sequence data instead of prerendered tracks)

Because the sound hardware was not based on anything made previously, unlike the PS2, they could choose whatever number they wanted to within reason.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">lidnariq wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">A cheap phone with a paucity of storage won't necessarily have the computational might to run a good-sounding softsynth in the background either.</div><br />You think? My cheap smartphone only has 8GB of storage, but it's never given me any trouble computationally. I don't do anything particularly intensive on it though; YouTube is probably the most computationally expensive thing I use it for.
