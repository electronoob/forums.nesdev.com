<br />I also have multiple pirate cart that I would love to dump but you have to understand that reverse engineering pirate mapper is a lot of work and you can't really expect someone to come forward and do it for you unless there is something major on the cart you are trying to dump.

<br />
<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">REGISTERS:<br /><br />$5010 - Chip Config<br />xxSC-xxPP<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;S = Select CHR ROM/RAM<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;0 CHRROM. 1 CHRRAM.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;C = CHR-ROM Size<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;0 256K. 1 128K.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;PP = PRG-ROM Size<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;00 512K. 01 256K. 10 128K.<br /><br />$5011 - PRG Chunk 256K Base Select<br />xBBB-xxxx<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;BBB = Selects 256K Base of PRG-ROM for MMC3 to Use<br /><br />$5012 - CHR Chunk Base Select<br />xxBB-xxxx<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;BB = Selects 128K Base of CHR-ROM for MMC3<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;Only values 00 and 10 are used but bit 0 may be<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;valid too.<br /></div>
<br />
<br />On Powerup PP of $5010 is zeroed, BBB of $5011 also zeroed. This causes the first 512K of PRG-ROM to be seen by the MMC3 which puts the Menu program in control. 
<br />
<br />$5011 really controls upper address lines on the PRG-ROM. $5010 controls address lines too, by deciding which ones the MMC3 can control and which ones it holds in a constant state to effectively set bounds for the ROM data seen by the MMC3. 
<br />
<br />That should cover most of the mapper and how it works.
<br />
<br />---
<br />
<br />Stuff about hardware. I'm not sure this is all exact as I'm no hardware expert.
<br />
<br />PRG-ROM Connections
<br />A16 and Below Connect Normally to MMC3
<br />
<br />A17 - HELD HIGH in 128K Size Mode, otherwise connects normally
<br />A18 - Connects to MBR if Size isn't 512K. If it is then it connects to MMC3
<br />A19 - Connects to MBR
<br />A20 - Connects to MBR
<br />
<br />MBR being Master Bank Register. It controls the upper PRG lines. The upper most 2 are always connected to the MBR. A18 is used in 256K and 128K PRG modes by the MBR. In 512K mode the MMC3 needs this as the ROM is 512K and needs that to switch between the first and last 256K of data. A17 connects normally to MMC3 unless the mode is 128K in which case its I think held high (+5v) so the lower 128K of the selected 256K block is all that is visible. This is used for Rockman 1. 
<br />
<br />I think all this is correct. CHR-ROM has a similar setup. I imagine you could built your own cartridge with a TxROM cart and additional hardware for the MBR.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Can somebody help me with "ironing" the wav file recorded by Tapedump? I'm getting great results when the recording time is less than 1 hour, but at larger files, I'm getting decoding errors when using KCS to decode the wav file. 
<br />I have done everything humanly possible to perfect my recording setup (using Famicom, recording from pin #46 of cartridge connector, disconnected II. player controller, using shielded cables and disabling any sound-altering plugins of my soundcard, using SoundForge soft).
<br />I have recorded both at 300 600 and 1200 bps, with same results. Running out of options here...
<br />I don't know which normalising settings to use, or what different methods of "cleaning" the audio recording can be applied.
<br />I'm using the same settings with KCS: kcs.exe -Bn -G2 -F10 file.wav file.nes ("n" being bps speed). Maybe I can use different settings or other decoding software...
<br />Any help highly appreciated!

<br />
<br />60 minutes even at 1200 bps???!?  How big is the cartridge you're dumping??
<br />
<br />One piece of advice is: if the cart you dump has PRG and CHR ROMs, split up the recording between dumps of PRG and CHR (the 5-second leader is played again before CHR.)  Then use KCS to decode each PRG and CHR recording.

By tweaking the TapeDump itself, I was trying to dump each game by itself (128,256,384,512,512 and 512 kB) and by one tweak, I was dumping a data chunk of 768kB (containing the whole Rockman 3 data) to get the idea how the whole menu system works (this one took 8 hours at 300bps with 7 decoding errors, I got only one dump at 1200bps/2hours with no errors). 
<br />I succesfully dumped Rockman 1 and 2 (MMC3 hacks), but I'm unable to correctly dump Rockman 3 to 6 (yet).
<br />
<br />I am using original Japanese Famicom (NTSC/HVC-CPU-GPM-02C) with NTSC version of TapeDump, connected to a quadcore/4GB_RAM/Win7 PC.
<br />
<br />Any other help? Something about editing the finished recording?

<br />There's always only one decoding error in the Rockman3 dump, couldn't it be because of this sound between PRG and CHR?

<br />
<br />There's no problem building it but can you provide the software for it? Something understandable (English) and relatively easy to controll? Last time I asked about this I was pointed towards some Japanese web, couldn't even get the right schematics...
<br />But if it's that simple, why then the need of CopyNES? Profit?
