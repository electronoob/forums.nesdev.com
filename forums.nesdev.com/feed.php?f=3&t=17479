Yes, MAME supports Dual Vs.<br /><br />As for Barcode Readers, a more convenient interface at least for the Datach variant would be to allow the user to select a barcode from a pre-made list of codes, in addition to allowing the user to input a custom barcode as a number. Each Datach game (except Crayon Shin-chan) came with 40 character cards, without the code being printed on them as a number, and a user-friendly emulator would allow them to be selected by name. Unfortunately, I only have the code list for Datach Dragon Ball Z (from a website), not for any of the other games.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=133">NewRisingSun</a> — Fri Jun 29, 2018 8:10 am</p><hr />

Lots of great responses so far; kudos to everyone for contributing. Still gathering a list for other consoles as well, but when I'm done (or when I think I'm close to done) it'll be public. I'm thinking about making some notes regarding possible misinformation that needs to be corrected. For example, on this page: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://emulation.gametechwiki.com/index.php/Nintendo_Entertainment_System_emulators#Peripherals">http://emulation.gametechwiki.com/index ... eripherals</a><!-- m --><br /><br />Stuff like Karaoke Studio is listed as &quot;unknown&quot; for emulation status, and I think Dwedit mentioned the Miracle Piano on reddit last year (and the link above lists that as unknown), so any false positives that can be eliminated, I'll definitely have a section about them and write down any supporting emulators.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=6368">Shonumi</a> — Fri Jun 29, 2018 8:06 am</p><hr />

I once owned an exercise device that connected to the SNES, but I've never found any information about it online anywhere.  It was a chair where the seat was mounted to a stationary base frame via some sort of spring.  Using a motion similar to a rowing machine, you would press your legs against stationary pads in front of you and the seat would move backwards.  But the seat could also pivot in 4 directions, serving as the D-pad.  The remaining controller buttons were on stationary handle bars attached to the base frame.  In other words, you changed directions in the game by literally wiggling your ass.  I'm completely serious.  And it was not a bicycle.  I wish I still had it.  I don't even know the name of it.

My first NES was a peach color, since then I've also seen ones that have been white, purple, and dark green.<br /><br />It can't really affect gameplay, just when first powering up the system, if at all.  I'm pretty sure at least the Game Genie doesn't initialize the palette immediately, I don't know of any other examples.  You'd see it all the time if your connector was bad, hehe.  Developers will often see it when they don't use the palette, or screw up their reset bad enough.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=10">Memblers</a> — Fri Jun 29, 2018 12:38 am</p><hr />

@Shonumi -- understood! Your explanation makes total sense (and is much better than mine).  :-)<br /><br />I have lots of folks who follow me on Twitter given my SNES/NES background so <a href="https://twitter.com/koitsu2009/status/1012538725849415680" class="postlink">I tweeted out mention of this thread</a> in hopes it gets more eyes thus potentially more devices.<br /><br />@Sour -- It's been a while since I've tried Mesen, but great to know.  I wasn't even aware that a lot of this stuff had been documented by nocash -- I always thought peripherals had been neglected (esp. those from Asia), e.g. tribal knowledge + reverse-engineering emulator source + &quot;oh there's this one .txt file that's in broken English&quot;.  But peripherals I never focused on much.<br /><br />And yeah, there's at least 4 models of modems.  I know which one I have and will have to see if it powers on + boots into a FW/BIOS of some kind.  Literally have no idea how it works/what its behaviour is.  But if it's got a FW/BIOS that's EPROM-based then I could certainly dump it.  I won't have time for this until next week.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3">koitsu</a> — Thu Jun 28, 2018 9:13 pm</p><hr />
