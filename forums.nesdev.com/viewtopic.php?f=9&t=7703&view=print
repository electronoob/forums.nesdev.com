<br />
<br />I suspected the reader was at fault, because the thing would act really funny when I had the CF card in there; it'd shut off, the power light would blink, Windows would report the device as perpetually not-ready, all until I removed the card.
<br />
<br />So beware, I guess. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" />

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I purchased my Power Pak a few weeks ago.  I bought the PP and card reader from Retrousb (as you did), but I got my CF card from newegg (8GB Dane-Elec).  My CF reader works fine.
<br />
<br />The CF reader that Retrousb shipped is in a blue transparent plastic shell, about 2" long, 1.25" tall and maybe 1/3" thick.  There is a visible silk-screen on the PCB in the unit that reads "910".  The CF reader has slots for other media types too (XD, SD/MMC and something else labeled MS/MSPRO).
<br />
<br />Does this describe the CF reader that you got too, or did you get a different one?

<br />I don't think there's anything special about that game that would make it not work on a PowerPak, it appears to be a very normal MMC3 game... Check the header, a lot of ROMs fail to work because of bad headers.

<br />Nope, the header is as correct as I can tell. The menu screen gets garbled, and there are major graphical problems in game, and certain modes lock up.
<br />
<br />Krusty's Fun House has a glitchy info screen when you start the game... I wonder if the MMC3 mapper I have is bad? The Acclaim screen is glitchy when you reset too.
