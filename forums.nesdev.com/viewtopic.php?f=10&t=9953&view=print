		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Hello everybody,<br /><br />For some while, I've been trying to find the background tile number of the tile based on the location of my sprite.<br /><br />I've been reading (and learning) in these threads:<br /><a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/viewtopic.php?f=10&amp;t=7451&amp;start=735" class="postlink">8x16 sprite is really a 16x32 pixel image?</a><br /><a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/viewtopic.php?f=2&amp;t=352&amp;start=75" class="postlink">Object collision</a><br /><br /><br />But I still have some trouble figuring it out and fitting it all together. Maybe someone can give me some pointers ?<br />Here are the things I think I understand (feel free to correct if somethings wrong):<br /><br />- Background tiles are stored in an 1D array ==&gt; one after the other<br />- Sprite location is in 2D (x,y coordinates)<br />- So we have to use a conversion, depending on the height and width of the background sprites<br />- For this we can use the formula: (y / MetatilesWidth) * NumberOfMetatilesPerRow + (x / MetatileHeight)<br />- I have 8x8 tiles as background (so the above formula should say: &quot;tiles&quot; instead of &quot;Metatiles&quot;, correct ?)<br />- So if my sprite location is for example (x,y) = (15,31) it would give: (31/8) * 32 + (15/8) = 3*32 + 1 = 97 <br />- The background tile (at location x,y) is then the 97th one in my 1D array of background tiles<br />- I may not multiply by 4 instead of 32/8 because the division is used to round the y value of my sprite to a multiple of 8<br />- I can however do an AND #%11111000 and multiply by 4<br />- because our 1D-array has values bigger then 255 =&gt; we need a 16 bit variable to be able to get it out of the array.<br /><br /><br />And that's where I'm stuck. I know that all I have to do is load the 97th tile in my background array. <br />But I'm stuck with converting the (x,y) position to a 16 bit number and then extracting the tile number out of my array with that 16 bit number.<br /><br />1) The 16 bit variable:<br /><br />- Do I need to reserve 2 variables ? For example: TempLow and TempHigh.<br />- I first need to reserve the Low variable (little endian thing ? )<br />- Or is it allowed to create 1 variable and reserve 2 bytes of space  (just Temp) ? Is there then a method to load/store from the high part of this variable ? Or will I run into problem later on by not creating 2 seperate variables ? <br />- Getting the x-value into the TempLow (or just Temp) will be no problem (I think):<br /><br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">LDA Sprite_position_X&nbsp; ; Load A with the X position of my sprite<br />LSR A ; divide by 2 ==&gt; X/2<br />LSR A ; divide by 2 ==&gt; X/4<br />LSR A ; divide by 2 ==&gt; X/8<br />STA TempLow ; store A now into the TempLow variable (or lower part of Temp)<br /><br /></div><br /><br />But converting the Y-value into the TempLow/High part.....<br /><br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">; we need to divide by 8 (to know the amounts of rows we have)<br />; and then multiply by 32 (32 tiles a row)<br /><br />LDA Sprite_position_Y&nbsp; ; Load A with the Y position of my sprite<br />AND #%11111000 ; this is the same as dividing by 8 and multiplying by 8.

Instead of a combo of the two ?</div><br />The &quot;logical&quot; in the shift instructions mostly means &quot;always shifts in a 0&quot;. &quot;arithmetic&quot; mostly means &quot;does something appropriate rather than just always shift in 0&quot;. If they actually provided an ASR instruction, it would shift bits 7-1 down to 6-0 and then copy bit 6 back to bit 7. But on an 8 bit micro, it's not clear that's useful; any time you're doing other than 8-bit binary math you'll only use that once, and you may as well force them to write it out longhand (<tt style="margin-left: 2px; margin-right: 2px; padding:3px; background-color: #3355aa; color: white;">CMP #$80</tt>, <tt style="margin-left: 2px; margin-right: 2px; padding:3px; background-color: #3355aa; color: white;">ROR</tt>)<br /><br />I'm going to arbitrarily guess they chose the pair of ASL+LSR to make the two instructions more visually distinct (and make it easier to catch bugs?).

For example: TempLow and TempHigh.<br /></div><br />You need to reserve 2 bytes of memory. Whether you use one label or two doesn't matter.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">- I first need to reserve the Low variable (little endian thing ? )</div><br />Not required, unless you want to use the variable with some of the indirect instructions of 6502 like <tt style="margin-left: 2px; margin-right: 2px; padding:3px; background-color: #3355aa; color: white;">JMP &#40;ptr&#41;</tt> or <tt style="margin-left: 2px; margin-right: 2px; padding:3px; background-color: #3355aa; color: white;">LDA &#40;ptr&#41;,y</tt>. But the convention is usually to put the low byte first (and yes, it's called little endian).<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">- Or is it allowed to create 1 variable and reserve 2 bytes of space  (just Temp) ? Is there then a method to load/store from the high part of this variable ? Or will I run into problem later on by not creating 2 seperate variables ? </div><br />Yes you can create one label for 2 bytes. To access the low byte, do <tt style="margin-left: 2px; margin-right: 2px; padding:3px; background-color: #3355aa; color: white;">LDA foo+0</tt> (or simply <tt style="margin-left: 2px; margin-right: 2px; padding:3px; background-color: #3355aa; color: white;">LDA foo</tt>) and for the high byte <tt style="margin-left: 2px; margin-right: 2px; padding:3px; background-color: #3355aa; color: white;">LDA foo+1</tt><br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">ASL A ; multiply by 2 ==&gt; if we started above with 1111 1111 ==&gt; AND would give 1111 1000 ==&gt; ASL would give 1111 0000<br />ASL A ; multiply by 2 ==&gt; Next ASL would give 1110 0000<br /></div><br /></div><br />This you can't do. The result of ASL will not fit in 8 bits, so after ASL you need to shift the discarded bit (in carry) as the lowest bit of TempHigh. Using your example, after first ASL high byte would be %0000 0001 and after the 2nd ASL it would be %0000 0011. You can use ROL to shift the carry into TempHigh (just remember to clear it first), effectively achieving a 16-bit left shift.

Anyway, it will load a 16-bit pointer from address pointed to by &quot;background&quot; label, and then add Y to that 16-bit pointer, then fetch an 8-bit value from the resulting address.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">Do I now need to Load X with the 16 bit variable ? This isn't possible ? x is only 8 bit ?<br /></div><br />Yes, it's not possible. Whenever you need to do this, you have to calculate the 16-bit pointer on the zeropage and use <tt style="margin-left: 2px; margin-right: 2px; padding:3px; background-color: #3355aa; color: white;">LDA &#40;foo&#41;, Y</tt> or sometimes <tt style="margin-left: 2px; margin-right: 2px; padding:3px; background-color: #3355aa; color: white;">LDA &#40;foo, X&#41;</tt> addressing modes.

This is very confusing, because on the NES graphics are either sprites or background, they can't be both!

For example: TempLow and TempHigh.</div><br />That depends on how you're reserving RAM for variables. If you're doing the old <strong>VARIABLE EQU ADDRESS</strong> way, you can just declare the variable that follows this one 2 addresses ahead, instead of just 1. If you're using an assembler directive that reserves bytes, you can just reserve 2 bytes instead of 1 (i.e. <strong>VARIABLE .RS 2</strong>). You can declare the low and high bytes separately like you wrote, but IMO that looks uglier in the code and will not make it clear whether the bytes are stored back to back (could make a difference for pointers and such).<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">- I first need to reserve the Low variable (little endian thing ? )</div><br />In the NES, the low byte comes first, then the high byte.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">- Or is it allowed to create 1 variable and reserve 2 bytes of space  (just Temp) ? Is there then a method to load/store from the high part of this variable ?</div><br />That's what I would recommend. You can access the low byte with MyVariable+0 (this is for clarity only, since adding 0 to an address doesn't do anything) and the high byte with MyVariable+1.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">Or will I run into problem later on by not creating 2 seperate variables ?</div><br />Not at all. I recommend creating separate variables for 16-bit (or longer) values only if you can't store them back to back for whatever reason (like if you have an array of low bytes and an array of high bytes).<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">LDA Sprite_position_X&nbsp; ; Load A with the X position of my sprite<br />LSR A ; divide by 2 ==&gt; X/2<br />LSR A ; divide by 2 ==&gt; X/4<br />LSR A ; divide by 2 ==&gt; X/8<br />STA TempLow ; store A now into the TempLow variable (or lower part of Temp)</div></div><br />That's OK. Don't forget to clear the high byte though.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">ASL A ; multiply by 2 ==&gt; if we started above with 1111 1111 ==&gt; AND would give 1111 1000 ==&gt; ASL would give 1111 0000<br />ASL A ; multiply by 2 ==&gt; Next ASL would give 1110 0000</div></div><br />Problem here is you're getting rid of important bits. You are multiplying an 8-bit value, meaning the result may not fit into 8 bits, so an 8-bit shift isn't enough to produce correct results. You need a 16-bit shift. You can try this:<br /><br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">ASL A<br />ROL Temp+1<br />ASL A<br />ROL Temp+1</div><br />This will make sure that the bits that extrapolate the 8-bit limit get shifted into the high byte of your 16-bit variable.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">CLC&nbsp; ; clear the carry<br />ADC TempLow ; add the value we got from out of sprite X to A. <br />STA TempLow; Store back into TempLow</div></div><br />If you cleared Temp+1 to $00, the carry will already be cleared after the last ROL, so you can leave the CLC out if you want to save time, or you can leave it there, just for clarity (what I do in these cases is comment the unnecessary instruction, so that I know it should be there, but isn't really necessary).<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">LDA Sprite_position_Y  ; Load A with the Y position of my sprite<br />; 1111 1111 ==&gt; the interesting bits are the 2 most left ones (6 other ones are already added in the low byte part) <br />LSR A ==&gt; 1111 1111 ==&gt; becomes 0111 1111<br />LSR A ==&gt; 1111 1111 ==&gt; becomes 0011 1111<br />LSR A ==&gt; 1111 1111 ==&gt; becomes 0001 1111<br />LSR A ==&gt; 1111 1111 ==&gt; becomes 0000 1111<br />LSR A ==&gt; 1111 1111 ==&gt; becomes 0000 0111<br />LSR A ==&gt; 1111 1111 ==&gt; becomes 0000 0011[/code]</div><br />Why are you working on the Y coordinate again? None of this is necessary. What you really need is to just add the carry to the high byte:<br /><br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">LDA Temp+1 ;get the high byte of the adjusted Y coordinate<br />ADC #$00 ;add to the hight byte of the adjusted X coordinate, plus carry<br />STA Temp+1</div><br />All done.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">LDA background, x ==&gt; this will load A with the value at background and add x ==&gt; for example 8 + 2</div><br />Ah, so you're loading from ROM, not from VRAM (name tables), got it. Anyway, this only works for 8-bit offsets, you have a 16-bit offset.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">LDA [background], x ==&gt; this will load A with the value at x places beyond background</div><br />This addressing mode doesn't exist on the 6502, you can only use the Y register in this case.<br /><br />What you need to do is convert your offset into a pointer. To do this you need to add the base address of your background to the offset, this will get you the final address of the tile you're looking for. Just do a 16-bit addition:<br /><br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">CLC<br />LDA #&lt;background<br />ADC Temp+0<br />STA Temp+0<br />LDA #&gt;background<br />ADC Temp+1<br />STA Temp+1</div><br />The &quot;&gt;&quot; and &quot;&lt;&quot; operators return the low and high bytes of an address, and can vary from assembler to assembler. NESASM for example uses LOW() and HIGH() for this, so you'd use <strong>LDA #LOW(background)</strong> instead.<br /><br />Anyway, now you can just do this to get the tile you want:<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">LDY #$00<br />LDA (Temp), Y; or LDA &#91;Temp&#93;, Y if it's NESASM</div><br />Yes, it's a bit silly that we have to load $00 into Y, but the 6502 doesn't have an indirect load instruction that doesn't use an index, so that's what you get. If you think this is too silly, you can not add the X coordinate to the pointer (i.e. Pointer = Base Address + Y / 8 * 32) and put X / 8 in Y, but that's up to you.

The pieces are falling together.<br />Also my apologies for creating confusion by using &quot;Background sprite&quot; instead of &quot;Background tile&quot;.<br /><br />So here is my new code (which I still have to try):<br /><br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent"><br />; declare variable(s)<br /><br />Temp .rs 2 ; reserve 2 bytes because of 16 bit <br /><br />LDA #$00 ; load A with 0<br />STA Temp+0 ; store in low byte of Temp<br />STA Temp+1 ; store in high byte of Temp<br /><br />LDA Sprite_position_X&nbsp; ; Load A with the X position of my sprite<br />LSR A ; divide by 2 ==&gt; X/2<br />LSR A ; divide by 2 ==&gt; X/4<br />LSR A ; divide by 2 ==&gt; X/8<br />STA Temp+0&nbsp; ; store A now into the low byte of variable Temp<br /><br />LDA Sprite_position_Y&nbsp; ; Load A with the Y position of my sprite<br />AND #%11111000 ; this is the same as dividing by 8 and multiplying by 8. But still necessary to get rid of the last 3 digit's. Only have to multiply by 4<br />ASL A ; multiply by 2 ==&gt; bit 7 is put in the carry, bit 0 = 0<br />ROL Temp+1 ; All bits are shifted left and the carry (from the ASL above) is used as bit 0 for the High byte of Temp. Carry can be 0 or 1.<br />ASL A ; <br />ROL Temp+1 ; <br />CLC ; not necessary to do because bit 7 of high byte from Temp+1 is always 0 <br />ADC Temp+0 ; Add Temp+0 to A<br />STA Temp+0 ; store the new Temp+0 value in the low byte of Temp. If overflow (sum to big) ==&gt; Carry is set<br />LDA Temp+1 ; load A with the high byte of Temp<br />ADC #$00 ; To add only the carry we just &quot;Add with carry&quot; 0. If carry was set ==&gt; it adds one to high byte.<br />STA Temp+1 ; Store this new value back into the high byte of Temp<br /><br />CLC ; clear carry just to be sure<br />LDA #LOW(background) ; load the low byte of the adress of where my background tiles are saved<br />ADC Temp+0 ; Add the low byte of Temp. <br />STA Temp+0 ; Store it back into the low byte of Temp<br />LDA #HIGH(background) ; Load the high byte of the adress of where my background tiles are saved.<br />ADC Temp+1 ; Add the high byte of Temp<br />STA Temp+1 ; Store it back into the High byte of Temp<br /><br />; So now we have adress of background + offset stored in the 16 bit variable &quot;Temp&quot;<br /><br />LDY #$00 ; load Y with zero<br />LDA &#91;Temp&#93;, Y ; load A with the 16 bit adress we have found with the above code. <br /><br />; and somewhere in my code I have the background;<br /><br />background:<br />&nbsp; .db $70,$71,$71,$70,$71,$70,$80,$81,$80,$81,$81,$80,$70,$71,$71,$70,$70,$71,$71,$70,$71,$70,$80,$81,$80,$81,$81,$80,$70,$71,$71,$70<br />&nbsp; .db $80,$81,$80,$81,$81,$80,$70,$71,$71,$70,$71,$70,$80,$80,$81,$80,$80,$81,$80,$81,$81,$80,$70,$71,$71,$70,$71,$70,$80,$80,$81,$80<br />&nbsp;.....<br /><br /></div><br /><br />Although I think I understand how it should be done, I still don't get why my code wouldn't/can't work. I made this code for 1 screen of background tiles. It could be that this code does not work when the sprite location of x,y can be bigger then 255 (or if the TileWidth changes). But at this moment: I cannot see the error in my logic (yet). I added some yellow code to explain my logic. In red I used the coordinate (X,Y) = 255,255.  Perhaps someone can tell me the flaw in my code ? PS: I don't want to seem ungratefull or anything by asking this. But if I know what I did wrong here (or in my logic), I can even learn more (and possibly prevent mistakes in the future).<br /><br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">LDA Sprite_position_X&nbsp; ; Load A with the X position of my sprite<br />LSR A ; divide by 2 ==&gt; X/2<br />LSR A ; divide by 2 ==&gt; X/4<br />LSR A ; divide by 2 ==&gt; X/8<br />STA TempLow ; store A now into the TempLow variable (or lower part of Temp)<br /></div><br /><br /><span style="color: #FFFF00">Imagine that Sprite_position_x = HGFEDCBA<br />By doing 3x LSR ==&gt; it becomes: 000HGFED<br />This is stored in TempLow = 000HGFED  </span><br /><span style="color: #FF0000">Let' s assume that Sprite_position_x = 255 = HGFEDCBA:<br />TempLow will then be: 0001 1111</span><br /><br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">; we need to divide by 8 (to know the amounts of rows we have)<br />; and then multiply by 32 (32 tiles a row)<br /><br />LDA Sprite_position_Y&nbsp; ; Load A with the Y position of my sprite<br />AND #%11111000 ; this is the same as dividing by 8 and multiplying by 8.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />The code looks correct to me. Are you sure that this is the part that's not working properly? Have you debugged the code and traced through it instruction by instruction to verify where the problem is?<br /><br />BTW, are you sure that <strong>Temp</strong> is in ZP? Pointers will only there, and NESASM has been known to silently assemble instructions erroneously when faced with bad addressing modes.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">KennyB wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"><span style="color: #FF0000">Note: No overflow possible ?!</span></div><br />True... since all the multipliers/dividers we're using to form the offset are powers of 2, this is more a matter of moving bits to the correct locations and combining them than doing any actual math. You could even use ORA to form the low byte instead of ADC, and not care about the carry or adding anything to the high byte.<br /><br />Personally, I'd do this (not in NESASM syntax):<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">&nbsp; &nbsp;;clear the high byte<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;lda #$00<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;sta Temp+1<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;;multiply the Y coordinate<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;lda SpriteY<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;and #%11111000<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;asl<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;rol Temp+1<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;asl<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;rol Temp+1<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;;add the base address<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;adc #&lt;Background<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;sta Temp+0<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;lda Temp+1<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;adc #&gt;Background<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;sta Temp+1<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;;divide the X coordinate and use it as an index<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;lda SpriteX<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;lsr<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;lsr<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;lsr<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;tay<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;;get the byte<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;lda (Temp), y</div><br />This is the fastest way I can think of... there are less accesses to memory and the coordinates are combined by the CPU on the fly, since the X coordinate is small enough to fit in less than 8 bits.<br /><br />Still, I see nothing wrong with your current logic. Even your &quot;manual trace&quot; led you to the correct result, so the problem must be somewhere else. Like I said before, debug the code as it runs. Add a breakpoint at the start of this code, then follow it instruction by instruction trying to figure out when things go wrong.
