		<td><b>Real time audio effects on NES channels</b></td>

	<tr>
		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I would like to apply real time audio effects to each sound channel from NSF files. I use Cubase, the digital audio workstation, and I would like to apply any VST effect that Cubase can use (chorus, reverb etc) to each of the NES channels, just as the NSF is being played.
<br />
<br />The best would be a VST instrument which plays NSF files, but I haven't found anything like that.
<br />
<br />Any suggestions?
<br />
<br />Thanks.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />First off, I'd be curious why you'd want to do this.
<br />
<br />But to solve your problem, why not just record each voice of the NSF into cubase and apply as many effects as you like? Might have to do some manual lining up of the tracks but if you're a Cubase user you should be able to do that in your sleep.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I haven't found any VST which accepts winamp plugins but it would have to be special in order to redirect NES channels through different paths so that individual effects can be applied. Of course I could record each channel and apply offline effects but I want to just play with effects on any NSF from a big folder in real time.
<br />
<br />Actually I have found that applying real time effects to the finished music, not to individual channels, is good enough. Since I have redirected all Windows sounds through Cubase, any VST can be applied to it in real time, and only applying a basic chorus to a NES soundtrack can produce great effects. It's not channel-specific but it works nicely anyway.
<br />
<br />Thanks.
<br />
<br />EDIT: I'll also try the NSF to MIDI converters I remember seeing on Zophar, could be fun hearing NES music played with different instruments. Although it's too bad I haven't found any real time NSF to MIDI converter, which could output to any MIDI port that Cubase could input from.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />the "stereo" mod for real NES hardware would give you two channels, but you'd need a modded NES and a powerpak.  
<br />
<br />if you're adventurous you might be able to get more than 2 outputs, i havent really looked at how it works

<br />
<br />Actually there is an NSF to Midi converter.   It's actually called NSF2Midi (Ironically).    Though it seems to play the channels as Piano.   But it might help you.
