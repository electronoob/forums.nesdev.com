<br />
<br />If you plan on rewriting the chips over and over, I suggest you use <a href="http://www.futurlec.com/ICFLASH.shtml" class="postlink">Flash Memory - Atmel Type</a>. The store has chips from 32kb to 512kb, wich is a pretty good range for NES use. The 32kb chips will work on NES carts whithout any rewiring, the others may need some.

<br />Futurlec is great for parts and EPROM's. I think it would take months for the sun to erase an EPROM, not too much UVC around luckily.

<br />
<br />You only need one, you just program one chip at a time.  Program the chr and then program the prg.  You will have to learn how to manually cut off the header and split files in a hex editor or you will have to find a program that does it for you.  I think I saw such a program in the forum recently, but I don't remember where.
<br />
<br />The chips depend on what size you need for the dev carts your making.
<br />
<br />You do need an eprom eraser if you are going to want to use eproms more than one time.  Sunlight is not an option.  Well it is if you want to wait till retirement to use them!  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />  I got my eprom eraser for about $40 on ebay.  I found a good industrial strength one that I have only ever seen one of.  Since the light can damage your eyes, I'm slightly scared by some of the cheap looking ones from Hong Kong on ebay.
<br />
<br />You can also just use flash memory which can be erased by your eprom programmer.  It's a little more expensive per chip, but then you don't have the cost of an eraser.

<br />You also don't have to wait several minutes to erase the chips. I think flash ROM's don't even have to be erased, you can just program the new data over the old one. Quick and easy.

<br />Like a Cross Refrence match for the 6502.  
<br />These will come cheaper than flash epproms and can buy them by the dozen.  
<br />I think i remember <!-- w --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.gameboymall.com">www.gameboymall.com</a><!-- w --> selling some king of cross reference match for the 6502.  Does any one remember?

<br />I want to have two chips that can be written and rewritten to test my demos and i then i want to be able to actually keep my demos as a collection using only chips that can written too.  Will i be able to use both with the Epprom Programmer?
