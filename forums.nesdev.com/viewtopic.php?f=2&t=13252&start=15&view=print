		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I think it would be a good idea to document exactly what capture device was used (and preferably other steps taken, like what software was used for the gaussian blur, and the settings). We may never find the one true NES palette, but it could still be interesting to have a collection of palettes from a variety of different devices. <br /><br />As for naming the colors, I have also thought that it could be a nice thing to have. E.g. in quick test ROMs it would be nice to be able to say that you want some sort of a blue instead of specifying the exact color number. Even better if we can standardize on the naming.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Yeah, I'd expect there are a lot of things that could happen to the signal at each stage. Amplifier nonlinearity, clipping, intentional or unintentional filter effects, quantization, etc. Despite this, I think it's very much worthwhile to have an empirically measured &quot;NES palette&quot;. It's always good to measure the real world case as well as you can.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I'm thinking about trying again with a new capture device. While most of the colors loo spot-on when I try them in an emulator, some others don't look right. For example the intro in Faxanadu when he's walking toward the world tree. The colors there don't strike me as being how it should be. <br /><br />At any rate, which device would you guys suggest? I know for HD recordings, the debate seems to be between Avermedia and Elgato. <br /><br />Also can you guys explain to me about the color emphasis and how I'd go about capturing that? I thought there was just the basic color palette and that's it. But if you're saying there's more to it, then I'd need a new test rom that gives me access to testing those colors. Thanks!

If there's source code it can probably be easily modified to do emphasis too.<br /><br />I actually was writing a palette test ROM today, which lets you play with and observe how emphasis works: <!-- l --><a class="postlink-local" href="http://forums.nesdev.com/viewtopic.php?f=3&amp;t=13264">viewtopic.php?f=3&amp;t=13264</a><!-- l --><br /><br />Basically emphasis lets the NES &quot;emphasize&quot; red, green, blue, or any combination of the three. This means there are 8 different possible variations of the palette, i.e. the 64 entries becomes 512.

Should run on NTSC/PAL/whatever, it's very simple, no special hardware tricks.<br /><br />Don't worry about the greyscale toggle, all that does is force all colors to use column 0 of the palette, it doesn't produce any new colors.

So, why should the colors that one person captured with the random TV that he happened to own be somehow declared more standard than any other TV? If the NES doesn't provide a standard in the first place, why should developers create one if it's proven that there are no objective values since even two &quot;identical&quot; TVs create a different output?<br /><br />If you really need a reference point, don't try to come up with a definite palette. Instead, just use other games as reference.<br />You want to use the color red? Take the color from Mario's pants in &quot;Super Mario Bros.&quot;<br />Skin color? Mario in SMB3.<br />And so on.<br /><br />Besides, I always found the colors in FCE Ultra quite decent.

With enough samples, you can get a really good idea of where the &quot;ideal&quot; version should lie, and just how much variation there is between sets. This is all good information; just because there isnt &quot;one true palette&quot; doesn't mean we can't measure and make use of the characteristics of real world palettes.
