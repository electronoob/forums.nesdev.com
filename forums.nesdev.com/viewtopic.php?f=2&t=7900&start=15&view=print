<br />It's called a PC. If you want to develop with less work, there you go. Virtually no limitations. Tons of languages and libraries to choose from. 
<br />
<br />The SNES is weak in terms of flexibility? What exactly doesn't "flex" for you? Are you annoyed by its limitations? You can bump up to PS1/Saturn, or PS2, or like I suggested just go with the PC until you feel the hardware can do what you want. The SNES is actually pretty flexible when you consider if you wanted to you could use the stock CPU as a slave solely for graphics/sound/input interaction with a separate CPU located in your cartridge, sort of like a SA-1. Only you could do whatever you want and use some really fast ARM CPU where you could program your game entirely in C and just write a slave program to run on the SNES to handle transfers from your ARM CPU to get your graphics and sound to the system and retrieve the input data from the controller and whatever else.
<br />
<br />Part of the fun of developing for NES or SNES or any old console today is the limitations and nostalgia.

I think consoles are the best choice for programming, since they have a set way they work and you're not slaving over libraries all day. Anyone else feel like that? I do a lot of Javascript programming and some C, but I prefer 6502 assembly all day.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I agree about working with consoles. The hardware is usually mostly the same (modulo, say, RAM bumps in later PSP models), and the libraries are much fewer making choosing easier. Not having to compensate for different screen resolutions in full screen, or RAM differences or OS differences, or processor speed differences is so freeing.
<br />
<br /> Even now that I'm capable of making PC games, I'd still prefer PSP. As for PC development being faster than NES, sure. But it's probably around the same speed as any other platform you can compile C for.

<br />
<br />More flexability. I'd want the first way of doing it, you can move blocks of memory everywhere it seems. [I'm unfamiliar with SNES though.] And probably since the VRam used a square (2^x) ammount of RAM and taking up an extra 32-64 bytes will eliminate the usability of 1 full screen of VRam.

DMA destination allows each channel to be used to copy to OAM, VRAM, palette, different scrolling registers, etc. And OAM isn't mapped into the VRAM address space on the NES, Game Boy, or GBA either. Your question sounds like "why is $4014 on the NES not in the $2000 block?".

So maybe being able to freely specify 20 different start/end addresses would be beneficial for neato graphix trickz. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" />
<br />
<br />I also recall the NES's sprite DMA just simply copying bytes into $2004. Nobody complained about that. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" />

<br />If it takes long, it takes long once. And you say it takes "longer". Longer than what ? I really don't get it.
<br />Anyways if you dislike the (S)NES hardware nobody is forcing you to use those platforms.

<br />
<br />I don't see any evidence that shows DMA was "hacked on in the last minute". The PC-Engine which came out before it had DMA. The MegaDrive which also came out before it had DMA. Why would Nintendo have added it last minute? 
<br />
<br />So what if it takes longer to program. It's not THAT big of a deal. Any game is going to involve alot of programming and design so it's not really unexpected that you have to deal with hardware quirks and such. 
<br />
<br />I think you'll find there is no perfect platform. Every platform has something that could be different to make it better. NES could have had more RAM, faster CPU, 4 nametables worth of VRAM, DMA, etc. SNES could have had a faster CPU, support a 320 pixel width resolution, etc. PS1 could have had more VRAM and RAM as well as a faster CPU. Thelist goes on and on.
<br />
<br />You just have to work with what you have. Part of the fun is getting it working despite unfriendly design.
