<br />I see advantages to both methods. The second way looks cleaner, but if by any chance you need to add another ":" in a block, you'll need to revise all branches and fix the number of +/-. If the multiple +/- are in the label instead, even if you add/remove more labels the references won't be screwed up.

<br />
<br /> ":" is used for global labels.  You don't particularly need it, but it signifies the end of a global label.
<br />
<br /> "+" and "-" are not allowed in any of the symbol hashing routines. But for some reason that you did, +: would be a global label. And if you tried to use it again - you'd get a multiple label usage error. 
<br />
<br /> In nesasm, putting a '.' before any label for an address marker, makes it local. Meaning you can reuse it. I could modify the string to hash routine if it knows in advance that this a local label, to accept those to character values. "." in nesasm is the same as "@" local symbol in other assemblers.
<br />
<br /> For my usage of - and +, I've always just done generic names with numbers after them, in local label format. Like .loop1 or .skip1, etc. I can always reuse all those label names anywhere else since they're local. But I think anyone coding for 65x assembler probably already knows about the general rules of local labels.
<br />
<br /> But anyways, yeah. That's why I would precede them with the local dot operator.
<br />
<br /> I guess I could try and added a new/alt local symbol hash routine if whitespace=0 and starting char = - or +. I guess I'll do this next/today.
<br />
<br /> On a related note: In nesasm/pceas you can assign/equate a local label tp a global symbol, as long as you're inside the local labels domain. This makes it easy for two things: If you have a routine that might have multiple entry points, but you want all the labels inside the routine to be local to avoid making unique labels (if you're done this, you know exactly what I'm talking about). The second is for self modifying code. I.e. code that sits in ram and you want to modify the operand of an instruction or the instruction itself. You can use local labels for these entry points, then inside the code equate that to a gobal symbol (and adding the offset if it's just the operand an not the opcode).

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />In my opinion, heavy reliance on anonymous labels just makes the code harder to follow, and in some cases, harder to maintain; If you add an anonymous label in the middle of an anonymous-rich block of code, you'll be tasked to update all of your branches, and there's a lot of room for error with that.
<br />
<br />It just feels dirty, and I don't know where everyone gets the conception that it's a good idea.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I implemented .- and .+ labels, but there's a problem.
<br />
<br /> The higher level operation parser assumes such characters are reserved for operators. I added an additional test logic that if the starting label uses a local dot operator '.' then these characters are ok and don't fail the string test.
<br />
<br /> The problem is this:
<br />
<br />.--test
<br />
<br />john_doe = .--test+$10
<br />
<br /> The parser assumes .--test+ is the string and not .--test. This causes a fail to identify the symbol and thus and unidentified symbol error.
<br />
<br />This would fix it:
<br />
<br />john_doe = .--test + $10
<br />
<br /> But that breaks compatibility older 65x source that uses compact writing for the operator logic (like I tend to do: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://pastebin.com/KewPeR0b">http://pastebin.com/KewPeR0b</a><!-- m --> ).
<br />
<br /> I know the point is - / + support. But adding via local label also breaks it even if you didn't start the local label with -'s or +'s. 
<br />
<br /> I'll see if I can just reserve the exception of using - and + for label local label definition and branch only instructions. So using it for anything else will not work (you wouldn't need it anyway).
<br />
<br /> If I have to write a whole 'nother duplicate routine for this and more test code, I think I'll just write in the support for it directly as - and + without the local operator. It's turning out to be much more work than I had originally thought.

<br />
<br />Same point of view here. I just opt for local labels instead since it make more sense to me. But I guess everyone has the right to his own opinion regarding this concept.

<br />Exactly. I thought it was great that local labels were added a while ago, but once I realized they can't get past +/- labels I concluded they weren't useful at all.
