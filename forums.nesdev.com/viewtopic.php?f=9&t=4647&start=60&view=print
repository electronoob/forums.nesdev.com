<br />Good idea!
<br />
<br />If I'm reading this correctly:
<br />
<br />SLNum: 209
<br />CPU Ticks: ranges from 306-317 / 102-105
<br />
<br />So scanline 209, but I dunno what pixel that translates to. It's outside of the 64-255 range though.
<br />
<br />(The breakpoint I set was on $E2BF, and I used fceux to find that address by looking for writes to $2001)

<br />I'm aware of that, but I don't know which of the theoretical 341 pixels are the 256 that show the game screen. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" />
<br />
<br />So, after reading Brad Taylor's doc (which REALLY could use some visuals... this might be good for wikification), it seems that the screen rendering is turned off offscreen, during the time where the tile data for the next scanline's sprites is fetched. I'm assuming this is considered hblank, but I'm not sure.
<br />
<br />Again, is this game susceptible to the sprite oam glitch by doing this?

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Did anyone ever get around to testing this quirk for the situation where rendering is disabled for N number of scanlines, and then re-enabled, instead of just happening at the end of the frame?<br /><br />I'm trying to have a black bar at the top instead of the bottom, and since I don't want the alternative dot crawl pattern of Battletoads, I have rendering enabled for 1 line just to prevent that. I wait for the previously set sprite#0 hit flag to clear to find end of vblank, delay N lines (normally one but about 20 in my current debug setting just to see what's going on) and then disable rendering in the &quot;safe&quot; area of 64-250. <br /><br />But it doesn't seem to help, even when no sprites are intersecting. Or more specifically, it works fine for most reset states, but I can sometimes get it into a reset state where sprites get corrupted. And that seems to include sprite#0, which causes the  &quot;wait for end of vblank&quot; sequence to fail miserably since sprite#0 doesn't get hit.<br /><br />Based on the previous theories, is it even possible to do this? If the sprite evalution state machine will have been interrupted in a state of acessing secondary OAM, I guess secondary OAM should have the state from where it was turned off while scanning of primary OAM would depend on pixel location where screen was re-enabled again?<br /><br />I'm also quite surprised why I never encountered this bug when making Years Behind, where I did the following seemingly more complicated sequences:<br />* Waiting for sprite#0 hit flag to get cleared to find end of vblank<br />* Enabling rendering <br />* Waiting for sprite#0 hit flag to get set<br />* Turning off rendering to re-write the palette for the status bar<br />* Turning on rendering<br />* Turning off rendering to restore the palette<br />* Turning on Rendering<br />* Finally, turning off rendering prematurely before the frame ends<br /><br />...all without having any troubles of this kind as far as I can remember. Then again, did anyone ever verify that the PAL NES has the same problem? (I'm using an NTSC NES now while Years Behind was developed exclusively on PAL)

So I'm prepared to accept your hypothesis of this hardware bug being fixed in the PAL NES as fact. That makes one more aspect where the PAL NES is superior to the NTSC one.<br /><br />I've also realized that this OAM corruption bug totally kills my plan to have a really cool water effect in my game by disabling the screen/switching on the monochrome bit and updating almost the entire palette to get a noisy white scanline followed by turning on rendering/switching off the monochrome bit and starting a wavy effect loop. Because it wouldn't be worth much if all water would need to be placed at a point where game characters can't pass through it <img src="./images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" alt=":(" title="Sad" /><br /><br />Or alternatively, I guess I could go with the previously made statement that sprite flickering &quot;characterizes NES games&quot;, and just let NTSC users suffer a flicker-fest that PAL users are spared of whenever there's water on a screen.<br /><br />Oh PAL-centric innonence of my nesdev youth, how I want thee back... never realized back then that I was spoiled with more simplicities than just long vblank times!

Even European-developped games, such as Battletoads, runs better on NTSC because the music wasn't adapter to PAL properly.

I could never fix the sprite glitching, so now I keep only the background disabled, and to mask sprites I put 9 high priority transparent sprites at the very top of the screen.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Thanks for the tip Tokumaru, but the main reason for my top black bar is not to hide sprites but to get some extra vblank time to do CHR animation. I guess the difficulty of this seriously makes me consider CHR-ROM instead though. But even with that my idea for the water effect still can't be done without turning screen off/on...<br /><br />I realized my game's timing is a bit too unreliable to use Blarggs sync code at the moment, since some code takes more than a frame, which also means I can't always do DMA. Probably better to play around with Blarrg's example code instead, as this has already turned a seemingly simple task of adding more sprite animations to my game into a task of rewriting its code into a testbench...<br /><br />Trying to move the point of disabling/enabling screen to always be around dot 330 did however show promises even without Blargg synchronization: Glitching is now totally independent of whether my metasprite intersects the black bar or not, and I get the following different glitch behaviors instead:<br /><br />1: Sprites 2 and 3 have flickering chr patterns<br />2: Sprites 2 and 3 have flickering chr patterns, but less noticable than in case A<br />3: No sprite flickering, but palette color index $01 and $0E get changed in some frames<br />4: No sprite flickering, but palette color index $02 gets changed in some frames<br />5: No sprite flickering, but palette color index $0E gets changed in some frames<br /><br />The glitch patterns I get seem to be a combination of reset state, and timing differences somehow trigerred by the &quot;software reset&quot; feature in my very simple in-game level editor in pause mode: Pressing SELECT turns screen off, copies a saved map in ROM to the normal RAM location and updates the PPU memory with it.<br /><br />So at least I'm getting somewhere, as case 1 and 2 would actually be acceptable to have in a game - you would just have to make sure not to use those sprite indices. And with Blargg Synchronization it should probably be possible to squeeze the write into the &quot;perfect&quot; spot. I already have code to avoid using the first sprite index for any metasprites so changing that to start at index 4 is no biggie, even if it'd waste 4 sprites out of 64.<br /><br />The other cases really confuse me though, as I don't understand how the palette entries could get corrupted unless written to? Seems to be yet another undocumented &quot;feature&quot; of the NES PPU... I have seen weird stuff like this happen if you write to $2007 while rendering is enabled, but I make sure to both lda $2002 to clear the latch, write #$08 to $2000 and #$00 to $2001 and double-write a constant chr pattern address to $2006 before doing any of the chr writes to $2007 in the black-bar area.<br /><br />EDIT: I found the cause of the palette glitches. I had forgotten to set the scroll values before waiting for end of vblank, and since I write the palette in every vblank that happened to be what VADDR was pointing at in the first scanlines. As long as rendering is enabled, the PPU seems to read just the lower bits of the address and thus rendering a seemingly correct picture (albeit with shifted scroll values). But for some reason I do not yet understand it will corrupt the palette entries when you disable rendering and VADDR is pointing at the palette region.<br /><br />After fixing that, only two reset states seem to exist: The one without any fliclkering, and the one where it only affects makes sprites 2 and 3 flicker. It might be possible to always get the first case deterministically by Blargg Synchronization, but it's probably not worth doing that for this alone. I'm happy to never use the first four sprites if it can let me freely do PPU updates anywhere in the screen. And it should allow me to do the planned water effect as well!<br /><br />So from what I can tell so far it seems that the easier guidelines for avoiding this hardware quirk are: Make sure disabling/enabling the screen happens around dot 330, and avoid using sprites 2 and 3.
