IMO, you should try to find why it's not working on some emulators, to make sure the error is theirs and not yours. I mean, input is the most basic thing a game does, unless you're doing it in a very unconventional way there's no reason for it not to work, you must have goofed somewhere.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I also finally accomplished my goal of making an efficient dynamic animation engine, and I even know how to take it one step forward.<br /><br />The trick is to compress all metasprites into a block that is 2 tiles tall and power-of-2 tiles wide, using a combination of 16x16 sprites and 8x8 sprites, and have the system strategically place the metasprites to fit within the rectangular grid of VRAM, to avoid fragmenting.  I still use the double-buffered 30fps load scheme, but now I could fit more metasprites into 8kB of vram (the other 8kB is being used for non-dynamic sprites), and I have more vblank time left over.<br /><br />Taking this one step forward, instead of using the 30fps double-buffered scheme, I can make newly spawned objects search for an open vram slot, update the vram slot when there is a new frame of animation for the object, and automatically de-fragmentize vram when an object is killed.  Obviously, there should only be a DMA update requested if there is either a new frame of animation or a vram slot relocation (due to auto de-fragmenting), but only if there is enough &quot;DMA bandwidth&quot; left.
