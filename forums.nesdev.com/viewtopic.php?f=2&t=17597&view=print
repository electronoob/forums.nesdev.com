But a few weeks ago, I was thinking about this and decided that it would be interesting to pick it back up again and rewrite it using everything I've learned in the past 15 years.<br /><br /><tt style="margin-left: 2px; margin-right: 2px; padding:3px; background-color: #3355aa; color: white;">nesromtool2</tt> is a package of commandline utilities for macOS, Linux and other *nix-like OSs. Licensed via the MIT software license, it currently (at the time of this post) supports:<br /><br /><ul> * validating nes ROM files in the iNES format (validating headers and data size)<br /> * dumping information about ROMs (CHR/PRG bank count, some mapper info, etc)<br /> * the import and export of CHR and PRG banks<br /> * import and export of CHR as either raw or PNG files (2-bit indexed color)<br /> * getting/setting/removing title metadata<br /></ul><br />There's also a pair of helper tools: <tt style="margin-left: 2px; margin-right: 2px; padding:3px; background-color: #3355aa; color: white;">chr2png</tt> and <tt style="margin-left: 2px; margin-right: 2px; padding:3px; background-color: #3355aa; color: white;">png2chr</tt> which can help during development so you can convert PNG files into CHR banks in your Makefile, for example. As long as the PNG remains in indexed color and only the first 4 colors in the palette are used, they can be re-imported.<br /><br />I'm not sure if this is the right forum to post this, but I figured I'd get this out there so folks can take a look and give me feedback on it. It's still got a ways to go, but it's pretty well documented and should be more or less bug free (of course, now that I said this, it's gonna completely fail to compile).<br /><br />Check it: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://github.com/sadistech/nesromtool2">https://github.com/sadistech/nesromtool2</a><!-- m -->

The issue I ran into was that naming things <tt style="margin-left: 2px; margin-right: 2px; padding:3px; background-color: #3355aa; color: white;">nrt-title</tt> and <tt style="margin-left: 2px; margin-right: 2px; padding:3px; background-color: #3355aa; color: white;">nrt-chr</tt> didn't really get me anything when it came to simplifying the CLI API, so I stuck with a single tool as the old one was. But it should be relatively trivial to break it all out into separate tools since that's how the code is structured, anyway.<br /><br />I spent about 4 days going back and forth making it both ways to see which I liked better and I figure it's generally better to ship something than not. paralysis through analysis and all that.<br /><br />I'll revisit this, but it's also the reason that <tt style="margin-left: 2px; margin-right: 2px; padding:3px; background-color: #3355aa; color: white;">chr2png</tt> and <tt style="margin-left: 2px; margin-right: 2px; padding:3px; background-color: #3355aa; color: white;">png2chr</tt> are standalone utils. the API was straight-forward to design and those made a lot of sense to be built that way.<br /><br />I also failed to mention that another goal of this project is to provide a low-level C library for working with these ROM files, so bindings could be added to other languages like python, node, or even bash. <br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">Perhaps NES 2.0 should be supported too (in addition to the old format).</div><br /><br />This is definitely on the roadmap. Are patches still a thing? I had some code for the IPS patch format, but I don't recall if that was ever bug-free or even worked in my original code-base.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">I wrote Farbfeld Utilities, which can do these things. See the bitff and ffbit programs, as well as perhaps ff-strip, to deal with CHR files. See pngff and ffpng to deal with PNG files. Indexed colour is not necessary, though; these programs can work with any kind of PNG file.</div><br /><br />I'm curious how this fits in to the CHR bitmap format since it's only capable of having a 4-colour palette per tile and is indexed color. Last week, I googled around and found that someone had made a nodejs utility for converting PNG-&gt;CHR, but the way they did it was by converting the image into 4-colour greyscale and assigning colors to the palette. Back when I was in graphic production, techniques like this led to some really incorrect edge-cases, so I wanted to avoid that by allowing the user to be very precise with their source PNGs.<br /><br />Thanks for all the input! If you've got any other suggestions, let me know!
