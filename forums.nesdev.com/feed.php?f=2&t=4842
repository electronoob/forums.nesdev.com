Regarding comment #3, I meant that it frequently 'unlocks' from turret mode without me releasing the A+B buttons.

It depends on what button you let go of first. Turret Mode works like this: It first sets both the ship's velocities to zero then updates the direction your ship is traveling (and thus what direction you're shooting) without actually moving your ship. If you let go of B button first, it simply allows your ship to move so you fly in the direction you were last shooting in. If you let go of A button first, it sets your ships velocities to 0 again. The reason which button you let go of first doesn't matter if you enter then immediately exit turret mode is because it sets your ship's velocity to 0 at the start and so even if you let go of B button first you'll still not continue flying. But if you use it to shoot in a direction, you must let go of A first if you don't want your ship to move. Alternatively just aim in the direction you want to move and let go of B to fly there.<br /><div class="quotetitle">noattack wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"><br />4.

Two controllers for one player is one of things I'm planning to add, since that would be the way I could make this "truest" to the original game. The original is for Xbox 360 and uses one joystick for shooting, one for movement. One of the things I REALLY wanted when making this was the ability to shoot in ANY direction even with one controller. Since people seem to dislike it, I'll think through how to implement the two controller scheme.<br /><br />So... I suppose I'm to try to add a control options menu with a variety of input settings. Here's what I'm thinking as far as things to set go:<br /><br />Styles: <br />1: How it is now. <br />2. Two Controller shooting.<br />3. Smash TV?<br /><br />Bullet Panning:<br />1: Bullet Panning on (Meaning smooth transitions. If you're shooting left and you hold down right it'll first stop shooting to the left so fast, go the middle, then start shooting right. 32 frames to change shooting direction. This is how it is now)<br />2: Bullet Panning off (You're shooting left. You press right and you're instantly shooting right)<br /><br />Deceleration:<br />1: On (If you're traveling left and you let go of left, you stop moving left)<br />2: Mid (If you're traveling left and you let go of left, you slow to a stop)<br />3: Off (How it is now)<br /><br />I will probably not add an asteroids style movement as I dislike it for this game. Since the ship's sprite can only be eight directions, it'd be hard to tell exactly where you're accelerating to at an inbetween angle anyway.<br /><br />One thing I don't like about having all these options is that certain implementations will definitely make the game easier. I don't want the highest high scores to only be possible with one method.<br /><br />All that aside, do those options make sense to everyone? Do the people who dislike the controls as they are see some combination of options listed here that they think they'd be able to work with? I make no promises, but I should be able to make all these options possible with some work.<br /><br />Also, has anyone tried this on a powerpak? I want to buy one if this game works on it.<br /><br />For those who do like the controls, has anyone broken 100,000 yet?<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3504">Kasumi</a> — Sun Feb 08, 2009 2:07 pm</p><hr />

I like this a lot.  The controls taking some getting used to, but pressing A+B to stop helps out a lot.  Robotron and Llamatron are couple of my favorite games.<br /><br />I liked the controls in Smash TV.  You can use 2 controllers for 1 player, so you'd have a dpad for moving and another for shooting (and a 4-player adapter for 2-player mode, but I haven't been able to try that yet).<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=10">Memblers</a> — Sun Feb 08, 2009 1:01 pm</p><hr />

Huh. And I was more proud of the control system than anything else.  <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" alt=":(" title="Sad" /> I really can't think of something else that would be well suited when the game starts to get intense. Part of the challenge in asteroids and moon lander type games is keeping control of your ship, but in this game left and right being mapped to turn would not be "immediate" enough to get out of tight spots when the game gets like this: <br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIjTqJdHGxg">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIjTqJdHGxg</a><!-- m --> (This is a video of the game its based on. Mine gets about this fast) <br /><br />For those who are having trouble, try taking advantage of the fact that "turret mode" stops your ship from moving. If you're flying right, and need to go left, press and release A+B then hit left. You can stop on a dime that way. <br /><br />I suppose I'll play robotron and see if I think those type of controls would work, and try and think of some other control methods you might like. <br /><br />As for sound effects: I suppose you're right, loopy that's something I should definitely do. I'm still pretty new to NES sound though. Still making sense of Brad Taylor's sound doc.<br /><br />I might post a NesterJ movie that shows a strategy or two. In the mean time entering the Konami code (Up, up, down, down, left, right, left, right, B, A) on the title screen before the menu pops up allows you to experiment with the controls without worrying about enemies. Try messing with turret mode and whatnot and see if you still hate it.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3504">Kasumi</a> — Sun Feb 08, 2009 12:53 pm</p><hr />

The ship shoots in the current direction you're traveling in. No more, no less. The direction the ship is facing has nothing to do with where you shoot. It's only affected by the last button you pressed. If you're moving mostly up and a little to the right, you'll shoot mostly up and a little to the right. <br /><br />Left and right only control horizontal movement, up and down only control vertical movement.<br /><br />Asteroids style movement (up equals accelerate, down equals brake) would have been too far from the original game to make me happy.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3504">Kasumi</a> — Sat Feb 07, 2009 6:26 pm</p><hr />

I'm somewhat hesitant about releasing it for a reason or two. I'm really only doing it because I want to know if this game will run on a real NES. The only reason I can think of that it wouldn't is that it doesn't clear out the sprites on reset. In any case, powerpak users, let me know. I'd like to buy one, but it'd be totally pointless if it doesn't run this. <br /><br />In any case this a clone of Geometry Wars. Controls for those who are too lazy to read the readme. (I don't blame you for it)<br /><br />A: Shoot Forwards<br />B: Shoot Backwards<br /><br />The ship shoots in the current direction you're traveling in. No more, no less. The direction the ship is facing has nothing to do with where you shoot. It's only affected by the last button you pressed. If you're moving mostly up and a little to the right, you'll shoot mostly up and a little to the right. <br /><br />Left and right only control horizontal movement, up and down only control vertical movement. (Reposted from below)<br /><br />A+B: Enter Turret Mode. Stops your ship so you can fire without moving. Releasing B first make you fly in the direction you're shooting. Releasing A first lets you exit turret mode without moving.<br /><br />Select: Use a bomb<br />Start: Pause the game.<br /><br />The game starts out REALLY slow, but it gets very difficult if you keep playing. So give it a chance, don't write it off as easy in the first minute.<br /><br />I would REALLY appreciate it if you read the readme anyway though...<br /><br />Btw, this game is made with nesasm. WOO! <br /><br />My High Score is 438,000, but I got that before it added lives and bombs. In all honesty I haven't really tried to get a high score on the latest version. Testing it has taken most of the fun out of it for me.<br /><br />Edit: I will probably make several other NES games, but not anytime soon. There are a few other games I want to remake, but I think I'm gonna make some original games first. I don't want to be known as "that guy who remakes recent games for the NES". <br /><br />Look for a platform engine test from me next I guess.<br /><br />Edit2: Post high scores if you want. Unless the moderators would have a problem with that.<br /><br />Edit3: For those who haven't played the game this is based on, Here's what it looks like<br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-_qlaywKBs">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-_qlaywKBs</a><!-- m --><p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3504">Kasumi</a> — Sat Feb 07, 2009 6:05 pm</p><hr />
