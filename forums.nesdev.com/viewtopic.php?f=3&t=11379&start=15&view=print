Basically there are just a couple pointers and a counter for a memory copy as Quietust mentioned. For some reason, your CPU is not exiting this loop when it should and so it proceeds on forever, eventually crashing itself when it writes to the MMC1 registers. <br /><br />Since it exits based on the Zero Status flag, you should make sure that it's being set appropriately. Are you setting the Z flag properly when the ORA operation happens? That would be the last operation to affect the flag.  If it isn't the Zero Flag, then it might be related to your ADC or SBC opcodes not behaving properly. I just thought I'd give you some ideas of where to look for the problem.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I took a look at this in FCEUX version 2.2.3-interim svn3071, since the debugger there provides enough insights into what PRG page/offset is used and what memory contents are that I figured it'd be helpful.<br /><br />The ROM I'm using is Zelda II - The Adventure of Link (U).nes, MD5 checksum 764d36fa8a2450834da5e8194281035a.  All this matters.<br /><br />I set a breakpoint on execute for address CECD -- this is the <tt style="margin-left: 2px; margin-right: 2px; padding:3px; background-color: #3355aa; color: white;">bne</tt>, because I wanted to see the code that lead up to that point -- and also added a breakpoint conditional for A==#6B (don't ask about the syntax; that's how FCEUX does it), since that value was taken from your own code log dump.  I then powered off the emulator, then powered it on.  I was able to get past the title screen + registered a new save game entry + chose it.  Upon pressing Start (to select a character/save game), the breakpoint hit.  I'm going to assume that's the situation/condition where this happens for you -- if not, please state so.  I did this multiple times to ensure the register values, code, etc. were always consistent.<br /><br />The code leading up to the first time that <tt style="margin-left: 2px; margin-right: 2px; padding:3px; background-color: #3355aa; color: white;">bne</tt> was about to be executed:<br /><br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">&nbsp;07:CEA9:85 00&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;STA $0000 = #$36<br />&nbsp;07:CEAB:A5 01&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;LDA $0001 = #$94<br />&nbsp;07:CEAD:69 00&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;ADC #$00<br />&nbsp;07:CEAF:85 01&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;STA $0001 = #$94<br />&nbsp;07:CEB1:A5 02&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;LDA $0002 = #$36<br />&nbsp;07:CEB3:18&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; CLC<br />&nbsp;07:CEB4:69 01&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;ADC #$01<br />&nbsp;07:CEB6:85 02&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;STA $0002 = #$36<br />&nbsp;07:CEB8:A5 03&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;LDA $0003 = #$6D<br />&nbsp;07:CEBA:69 00&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;ADC #$00<br />&nbsp;07:CEBC:85 03&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;STA $0003 = #$6D<br />&nbsp;07:CEBE:A5 04&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;LDA $0004 = #$6B<br />&nbsp;07:CEC0:38&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; SEC<br />&nbsp;07:CEC1:E9 01&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;SBC #$01<br />&nbsp;07:CEC3:85 04&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;STA $0004 = #$6B<br />&nbsp;07:CEC5:A5 05&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;LDA $0005 = #$02<br />&nbsp;07:CEC7:E9 00&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;SBC #$00<br />&nbsp;07:CEC9:85 05&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;STA $0005 = #$02<br />&nbsp;07:CECB:05 04&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;ORA $0004 = #$6B<br />&gt;07:CECD:D0 D1&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;BNE $CEA0<br /></div><br />The &quot;07&quot; shown on the left indicates that the code being executed is in PRG bank/page $07.  I believe this refers to the actual PRG bank offset according to static 16KB bank sizes (per .NES header definition).<br /><br />Register contents at this point were as follows (these are what the values are BEFORE the <tt style="margin-left: 2px; margin-right: 2px; padding:3px; background-color: #3355aa; color: white;">bne</tt> happened):<br /><br />A=$6B X=$00 Y=$00 S=$01F9 P={unused, B, I, and C set; all others unset}<br /><br />Stack contents: $A7 C1 00 A4 17 C0<br /><br />I also dumped the values of ZP locations $00 through $05 (keep reading for why).  FCEUX shows this to you (see the code log I pasted), but I wanted to know what they were right before the moment the <tt style="margin-left: 2px; margin-right: 2px; padding:3px; background-color: #3355aa; color: white;">bne</tt> was to be run.  Here are the contents:<br /><br />$00 = $36<br />$01 = $94<br />$02 = $36<br />$03 = $6D<br />$04 = $6B<br />$05 = $02<br /><br />I then stepped through the code (&quot;Step Into&quot;), which let the <tt style="margin-left: 2px; margin-right: 2px; padding:3px; background-color: #3355aa; color: white;">bne</tt> execute (as it should since Z is unset) and then looked at what happened:<br /><br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">&gt;07:CEA0:B1 00&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;LDA ($00),Y @ $9436 = #$0C<br />&nbsp;07:CEA2:91 02&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;STA ($02),Y @ $6D36 = #$0C<br /></div><br />After the <tt style="margin-left: 2px; margin-right: 2px; padding:3px; background-color: #3355aa; color: white;">lda/sta</tt> executed, these were the relevant registers:<br /><br />A=$0C X=$00 Y=$00 S=$01F9 P={unused, B, I, and C set; all others unset}<br /><br />The PRG bank did not change (it remained $07), which is correct behaviour because the <tt style="margin-left: 2px; margin-right: 2px; padding:3px; background-color: #3355aa; color: white;">sta</tt> is not touching MMC1 register space.  This routine looks like it's just screwing with the PRG-RAM (SRAM) contents within the $6000-7FFF region.  There should not be any bank switching happening at this time.  The <tt style="margin-left: 2px; margin-right: 2px; padding:3px; background-color: #3355aa; color: white;">sta</tt> is not changing anything within the MMC1 register space to cause a bankswitch.<br /><br />If the <tt style="margin-left: 2px; margin-right: 2px; padding:3px; background-color: #3355aa; color: white;">sta &#40;$02&#41;,y</tt> in your emulator is actually touching MMC1 bankswitching registers, then what that indicates to me is the values in ZP locations $02 and $03 are incorrect.  This would go along with what Quietust said about something happening earlier that may be causing this problem.  Rephrased: the <tt style="margin-left: 2px; margin-right: 2px; padding:3px; background-color: #3355aa; color: white;">sta &#40;$02&#41;,y</tt> may be writing to MMC1 register space when on a good/proper emulator it doesn't appear to (at least not through the first loop iteration / when A == $6B like in the code you posted).<br /><br />The loop all of this is in, for your information, is constantly tinkering with ZP locations $00 through $05, so that said: my gut feeling is that you may have some mathematical/twos-complement problems with your <tt style="margin-left: 2px; margin-right: 2px; padding:3px; background-color: #3355aa; color: white;">adc/sbc</tt> instructions, as those are the absolute top #1-incorrectly-implemented opcodes when it comes to people doing their own 6502 emulators.  I mention this because in the above code, I see <tt style="margin-left: 2px; margin-right: 2px; padding:3px; background-color: #3355aa; color: white;">adc</tt> being used without a preceding <tt style="margin-left: 2px; margin-right: 2px; padding:3px; background-color: #3355aa; color: white;">clc</tt> (which is perfectly fine, but you need to understand how <tt style="margin-left: 2px; margin-right: 2px; padding:3px; background-color: #3355aa; color: white;">adc</tt> works for it to be emulated correctly), and I see <tt style="margin-left: 2px; margin-right: 2px; padding:3px; background-color: #3355aa; color: white;">sbc</tt> being used without a preceding <tt style="margin-left: 2px; margin-right: 2px; padding:3px; background-color: #3355aa; color: white;">sec</tt> (also perfectly fine).  If you need reference material for the <tt style="margin-left: 2px; margin-right: 2px; padding:3px; background-color: #3355aa; color: white;">adc/sbc</tt> implementation (the topic has come up many times on the forums over the years and example code given many times), <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/viewtopic.php?p=19080#19080" class="postlink">here you go</a>; the implementation/code from blargg is correct (the rest of the thread is educational material, so if you read that, read the entire thing and don't be hasty).<br /><br />Second-most-common that I see are people getting the addressing modes wrong, specifically incorrectly implementing <tt style="margin-left: 2px; margin-right: 2px; padding:3px; background-color: #3355aa; color: white;">&#40;$xx,x&#41;</tt> vs. <tt style="margin-left: 2px; margin-right: 2px; padding:3px; background-color: #3355aa; color: white;">&#40;$xx&#41;,y</tt> (the former is pre-indexed, the latter is post-indexed).   The pre/post-indexed addressing modes should be very easy to implement (and don't forget about page wrapping, i.e. <tt style="margin-left: 2px; margin-right: 2px; padding:3px; background-color: #3355aa; color: white;">ldx #$02 / lda &#40;$ff,x&#41;</tt> would read from $01 and $02 to get the effective 16-bit address, not from $0101 and $0102.  Same goes for things like <tt style="margin-left: 2px; margin-right: 2px; padding:3px; background-color: #3355aa; color: white;">lda &#40;$ff&#41;,y</tt> which would read the effective 16-bit address from $ff and $00, not $ff and $0100).

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />It would appear that it was a problem with my SBC implementation, it looks like it wasn't setting the carry flag correctly. Using blargg's explanation on the thread that was linked on the previous post I took my ADC code and copied that into SBC, I then added a line in front of that to invert the bits in the operand. This seems to have fixed my problem and I can now get into the game. <br /><br />Thanks again!
