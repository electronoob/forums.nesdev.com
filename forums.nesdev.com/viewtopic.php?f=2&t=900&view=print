		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Has any attempteed to use Gameboy Tile Designer (<a href="http://www.devrs.com/gb/hmgd/gbtd.html" class="postlink">http://www.devrs.com/gb/hmgd/gbtd.html</a>) and Gameboy Map Builder (<a href="http://www.devrs.com/gb/hmgd/gbmb.html" class="postlink">http://www.devrs.com/gb/hmgd/gbmb.html</a>) to build maps for the NES? This would also seem to be useful for sprites, as it also supports 8x8 and 8x16 objects. The are quite a few utilities to convert bitmaps to this format (<a href="http://www.devrs.com/gb/hmgd/supp.html" class="postlink">http://www.devrs.com/gb/hmgd/supp.html</a>).
<br />
<br />These were excellent tools for building tiles, maps and, sprites for the Gameboy.
<br />
<br />Here's a few things that would make it more useful:
<br />If the tile size is set to 16x16, the palette could be assigned correctly for NES use. The only problem is that this would waste some tiles, but that could easily be fixed with an optimizer pass.
<br />
<br />Each palette would have to have color zero set to the same value.
<br />
<br />The GB 4 color binary tile would need to be modified for NES use. The Gamboy format exports each bitplane line interleaved, whereas the NES exports and entire bitplane.
<br />
<br />For example: an 8 pixel line of color 1 is exported as:
<br />FF 00
<br />
<br />on the NES this would need to be converted to (I think):
<br />FF xx xx xx xx xx xx xx
<br />00 xx xx xx xx xx xx xx
<br />
<br />It exports a 16x16 tile as 4 8x8 pieces in the following order:
<br />UL UR LL LR. I'm not sure this is an issue, since it should create a map with the correct tile indexes, regardless of tilesize.
<br />
<br />
<br />Is there something I'm missing?
<br />
<br />This sounds like a good tool for NES development.
<br />
<br />I will be testing this out shortly, and will post whatever conversion utility I create.

<br />
<br />Really cool, seems kinda like tUME, but simpler.
<br />
<br />If you write some conversion utilities or figure anything out with it, let me know.  That would help a lot.  Thanks for mentioning this program, it could be useful.  Certainly worth checking out, NES needs a 16x16 map editor extremely badly and I'm too lazy/busy to write it, heheh.  (and if I did, I'd probably write it as an NES program anyways, which would maybe be a little odd).

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I have used it. If i recall correctly the output is stored somewhat differently then what is directly usable by a nes. I wrote a simple converter in qbasic to fix that. I distributed this as a hello world demo that was the basis of a tutorial I had begun which got as far as display and collision detection. It's absolute crap and the format was intended to mirror the gb demos I had learned from. If I find it. I will post. I also used gameman as it is a superb utility as well.

<br />I found it. It also uses wla-dx. No tutorial but the code is pretty crap anyways. I improved it and added some basic box collision detection but couldn't find that version. It probably wasn't that much improved but I can pretend.
