I've even tried feeding it DC as GameTechUS suggested on his channel. It has been region unlocked by cutting the cic leg. <br />The motherboard looks in very good condition and i don't have a clue on what to do.<br />Last thing is that sometimes on the gray screen appear a couple of black characters in a random position on the screen but it happens very rarely and i couldn't figure out why they do.<br />Thanks in advance and greetings from Italy guys!<br /><img src="https://photos-2.dropbox.com/t/2/AABU-IOOQWbLGKKLhsdgwOJXLGjcpBIAScwy7rPft2Npyw/12/76291413/jpeg/32x32/1/_/1/2/IMG_9260.jpg/EP2fmDsYqAYgAigC/84d536IE416WyvMczUaa3zw2DzN9xxL4Q1WP5a6KXWs?size=1600x1200&amp;size_mode=3" alt="Image" /><br /><img src="https://photos-6.dropbox.com/t/2/AAD_p-FwoG1Stn1sBQi112ORec5f2P6ncPfecGXk0o-8nw/12/76291413/jpeg/32x32/1/_/1/2/IMG_9261.jpg/EP2fmDsYqAYgAigC/30ry88Y8lh9FIVhjMjCRquVs6iiCOvtnVvU6belA3yI?size=1600x1200&amp;size_mode=3" alt="Image" /><br /><img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/content_link/rOMItFZlZVdG3WU7g5m36R6iKQo7azZuYLQOs2y3iuU0FEOcKnloNmAIGHVpsvr8/file?dl=1" alt="Image" />

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Gray screen with no audio is most likely your cpu not running for some reason. There's several reasons why this could be. The most obvious is of course a bad connector, but it seems you have tried a reasonable amount of things to fix that. <br />Sadly it's hard to say why your cpu isn't running, it could just be a corroded trace. It could be bad RAM. You could try replacing the caps (although I think you'd probably get SOME output if it was the caps). <br /><br />Also your images aren't showing up. <br /><br />Do you have any test equipment like a multimeter and/or an oscilloscope?

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />If you had a scope or a logic probe you could see if the adress/data lines are at least doing something (and wether the ppu is receiving them, the ram is receiving them etc). Since you don't seem to have one, you could try desoldering the cpu/ppu/ram and swapping them to a known working unit.<br /><br />Don't forget to double check dumb problems, is your game clean? Does it work on another nes?<br /><br />The interference on the second NES sounds like it might be solved by recapping it. Hard to say for sure without seeing the interference.<br /><br />edit: you could try measuring the RESET line on the cpu. During operation it should be HIGH. (5v+) If its stuck low the CIC becomes a suspect.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I once had a NES clone that had the same problem.<br />It was the CPU that was dead.<br />I replaced it and everything went fine.<br />You could try to put sockets on the board where there's some suspicious IC, this make simple substitution tests a lot easier.<br />Also, sometimes bad ICs generate a lot of heat, this can be a clue of what to try next.
