		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Well my friends, its time for old WedNESday's programming skills to go to the big emulator in the sky. Not only that it looks like I'll also be quitting gaming too.
<br />
<br />Although I started programming in 2003 (with my 6502 emulator) its been a mad on-off ever since then and I must confess that I find programming too stressful to do anymore. I suffer from a disorder called Trichotillomania (wikipedia it <img src="./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" />) which is a compulsion to pull out your own body hair and the stress of programming is making it 1000% worse.
<br />
<br />I would like to take this oppurtunity to thank everyone here for all of their help over the years and also to apologise to anyone for any flaming posts <img src="./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" />. Maybe one day I can return to it, but I doubt it.
<br />
<br />GOD this is so upsetting...
<br />
<br />And now I'm gonna sing myself out.
<br />
<br />'And I did it, myyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay...'

Maybe you just need to take a break, learn a new hobby, something to get your mind off coding for a while. It's very hard to do constantly. I learned this much the same way you are, I think. I kinda burned out, HARD, about 12 years ago, and basically "quit" programming. Went through college on autopilot, somehow pulled off getting a degree, and then got a job and am now back into coding hobby wise. Well good luck. Maybe you weren't even being serious, but I tend to empathize when people say things like this  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" />

<br />
<br />I had taken quite a long break from programming myself, I guess from 2005 to 2008 or so I don't think I coded anything.  That enabled me to get out the house more, and during that time I spent a lot more time practicing guitar (almost obsessively for a while, heh).

<br />
<br />Well technically I'm British originally.  Born there &amp; lived there until I was 10.  
<br />
<br />But...alas...I showed absolutely no signs of caring about the recent royal wedding.  Which is funny because if I were truly an American you'd think I would be going spastic over it.

<br />
<br />Or something like that.
<br />
<br />I hope things work out for you.
<br />
<br />Perhaps you can try other ways to involve yourself in the NES development scene that would be easier on your condition? Like running competitions, blogging reviews of homebrew games, collecting rare / undumped carts and publishing their information to the NESCartDB. There's all kinds of things out there you could try.
<br />
<br />I don't know if that came across very well. I am trying to be supportive.

<br />I don't know of any "Baramos". But if you mean "Bananmos", then no, he's Swedish.
