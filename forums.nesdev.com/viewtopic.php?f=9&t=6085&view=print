<br />
<br />1. The eprom size: Is it possible to use eproms with more space the game needs?
<br />
<br />2. Is there any guide to make mega drive repros? Cant find any information about wiring and compatible boards.
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />Thanks in advance.

<br />We at NESdev don't support people making repros, first it's illegal and who tell us you're not a dirty guy asking for advice from us (we freely give our free time) only to to sell them and get money ? I've been bet by a few guys this way MANY TIMES before (sivak, ...) but won't fall in again. We only support people making dev-carts for programming purpose.
<br />
<br />I hope I made myself clear.
<br />
<br />If all you wanted is just play those games play them emulated.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />We're not repro friendly because of the "dine and dash" that happened often recently.  I will answer a few of the question but I will not go more far than that.
<br />
<br />1.  Yes you can. You have to copy the same rom over and over until the end of the EPROM.
<br />
<br />2. I saw someone on the net made a megadrive cart but I'm not aware of repro. We're a nes forum after all so you won't find that information here.
<br />
<br />3. No idea what you're talking about.
<br />
<br />4. I don't have knowlege about snes board. Maybe possible but that just a guess from what I read.
<br />
<br />5. Bregalad was nice to answer this one. Only that rare japanese game can do it. It's not worth it.

<br />
<br />thank you for your answer.
<br />
<br />What are the best homebrew games that are compatible to my gauntlet 2 board?
<br />
<br />Which project you would recommend to learn building cartridges?
