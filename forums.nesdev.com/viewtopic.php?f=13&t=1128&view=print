There have been three new spam posts in just this evening (morning, whatever).   I'm sure that if someone new is really wanting to program for the NES, they won't mind creating an account to get their questions answered.  Thoughts?

<br />If someone new comes to the boards and see that spams, they won't take us seriously.
<br />For accoutumed people, having new thread with spam can be ignored/tolerated, but having spam respond to existing post, and additionnaly bring up old topics, it is really deplorable.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Yeah, it's a never-ending struggle.  Finding and removing spams isn't my idea of fun (today is my 25th birthday, the spammers are giving me a gift of grief, heh).
<br />
<br />And I've been noticing more and more that phpBB's ban control is a total POS.  I try to remove the old bans when adding new ones so the list doesn't become infinite, but it seems to randomly choose to add new bans to the top or bottom of the list..  I'm just assuming that a giant ban list is gonna overwork the server.  Plus I think most spams are 'hit and run' basically (I'm seeing identical spams from different IPs).  Quietust recommended a mod that improves it, I'll install it sometime eventually.
<br />
<br />Forcing people to register won't stop the spammers, it might slow them down a bit.  We're using probably the most popular forum software on the net, so it comes with the territory unfortunately.  They even get past the captcha thing.
<br />
<br />But yeah, I'll assign some moderators.  tepples, you can be one if you want.  And anyone else who's here as often or more often than me.  Anyone else just reply here to apply.  We won't need an army of mods, just a few good ones.
<br />
<br />Bregalad makes a good point tho, if the spamfloods don't get under control it's gonna start to stink the place up.

<br />
<br />edit:
<br />looked through the security things on the phpbb pages and there seems to be some intresting that might help:

<br />
<br />some I found:
<br />
<br />[2.0.13] disable spambots
<br />This mod uses cryptographic signing techniques to ensure that any comment submissions have occurred from an appropriate
<br />comment form (stopping simple random-submission bots)
<br />
<br />[2.0.12] Visual Confirmation for Guests
<br />Adds visual confirmation for guest posts, eliminating spam. 
<br />
<br />[2.0.18] Block Open Proxy Registrants
<br />Blocks those attempting to register from open proxies. 
<br />(but this one can be troublesome for those members who isn't spamers and using proxies)
<br />
<br />..I don't know, maybe this are not that good at all.. what do you all thinks?

<br />
<br />If you do install "block open proxy registrants", make sure that the function to contact an admin works because people in some countries <em>have</em> to use open proxies in order to get an uncensored view of the Internet.
<br />
<br />Oh, and thanks for the mod powers.

<br />
<br />Just in the past couple days I deleted about 6 spammer accounts.  They could've logged in, but it seems they rarely post anything.  They just put up links to shady sites in their profiles.
