		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" /><div class="quotetitle">tdondich wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">@Rainwarrior , is there any documnentation on what addresses would have open bus behavior on the cpu data bus?<br /><br />And let me clarify, the value that will be returned on $4016 should be based on how it was addressed.  Since most control pad read loops use absolute addressing, that's why the bits 7 - 4 will be set with 010, since it's the bits in the high byte of val 0x4016.  Correct?  The only way it'd be different is if it was addressed differently.</div><br />Hmm, I think the open bus article could use some additional info about what regions may be open bus.<br /><br />Yes, you can get a different result by using indexed addressing from a lower address, but I think a PowerPak or Everdrive (or other cartridge) might have the potential to alter the open bus behaviour in different regions as well. I don't know the specifics of this. I think tepples tested it a while back.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">zeroone wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">Just out of curiosity, why didn't the instruction set test ROMs detect an issue with ASL ?</div><br />The test ROMs probably don't test every instruction on every possible address. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" />

That test ROM and derivatives thereof are probably the only thing that relies on any difference between open bus in bits 7-5 and just driving them to 010 (the upper bits of $40/$41). And even then, the only difference is probably that the NES controller graphic will or won't be turned into a dogbone or an RF Famicom controller I or II.
