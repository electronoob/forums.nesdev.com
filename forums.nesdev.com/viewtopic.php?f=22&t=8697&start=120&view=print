Since there's no way around this, other than redesigning all the screens, I'm sure I'll get used to it. I can't play much now since I'm working, but I'll definitely play more later.

Still can't get through the second screen, though.</div><br />You know — something to think about — after playing through this game countless of times while testing it, it's definitely easier to see why the developers of some of the old NES games felt the need to make the games so hard. IOW, after playing the game so much, your judgement of what exactly is &quot;hard&quot; does get skewed a lot.<br /><br />After playing it so much, I might say it's not unfair to have a limit of 5 lives, with possibly some extra lives scattered throughout the levels, but I can remember that's not close to what I was thinking when I was playing through the Flash version for the first time!

And nice to see you got that title scrolling effect working so well! <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />I do however stand by my earlier statement that the sprite limit gets too visible at times... I'd still recommend you to always make the score/bonus counter sprites have the lowest priority so the sprite limit does not affect the gameplay.<br /><br />Also, there's quite a few places where the original game had too many enemy sprites horizontally placed but where reducing them to fewer would have minimal effect on the gameplay... one example is the 9 parading clowns you encounter in &quot;STREEEEEMERZ MODE&quot;... having just 5 of them with empty gaps of space in between would require godspeed to squeeze between two of them.<br /><br />I played it on my old CRT, and didn't notice the clipped lines at all... except for the fact that the top border of the text box frame got clipped, which looked a bit ugly but not crippling the gameplay anyway. So if it's easy to move it down by 8-16 pixels that would be appreciated, but it's no biggie <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />

At the moment I can manage with just one split using sprite 0 hit.<br /><br />It would look better though, I agree (even my HDTV clips the top 8 pixels), I just didn't want to add the extra complexity at the time. So, we'll see, maybe it'll happen eventually.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />So, I played through &quot;SUPERB JOE MODE&quot; as well... turned out to be quite an easy run, and I was pleasantly surprised that it was about racing some new areas in the last level as I just assumed up until the point I tried that it would be about trying to beat the full game in a mere 5 minutes of time... <img src="./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" /><br /><br />No cheetahman ghost the second time around though, but I guess that feature would be pretty hard to pull off with the small amount of CPU RAM... though I noticed that the sprite table contains the gameplay sprites and the face sprites simultaneously, even though only one of those are visible at the same time. So if you feel for rewriting the communications code to have a big blank area in the sprite CHR, you could use that for storing interpolated delta coordinates. And since only 25% of the second nametable is used AFAICT, that gives another 0.75kB of RAM to streem to/from. Just a crazy idea, I totally understand if you feel it's not worth the effort <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">Yup, it's not exactly easy, because in that case I'd have to 1) set the scroll for the level 2) set the scroll for the textbox after a sprite 0 hit 3) use timed code to wait until the end of the text box (with different timing for NTSC/PAL/Dendy) 4) set the scroll for the level again.

I didn't realize you were using scrolling for this one - I just assumed you were doing the boxes like the pause box in Megaman1, rounding it's coordinates to the next tile boundary to center it on screen. If you feel like doing any timed code experiments though I have a Powerpak and both a NTSC/PAL console and would be happy to help you out with testing.

After trying with nintendulator, the music was night &amp; day. It's quite good and sound like the original, which I tried today to compare to figure out where was the problem I had.

This is exactly what I was thinking first: the music was crap intentionally.  It did fit the theme of the game! I was going to suggest that you improve the soundtrack to make it sounds better.. ^_^;;
