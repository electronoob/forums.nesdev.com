I simply overwrite last frame's sprites with the current frame's ones and only clear (using a high Y coordinate, no need to waste time on the other bytes) the ones that weren't used. This means that if I use all 64 sprites, or something close to that, I'll spend nearly/absolutely no time clearing memory.</div><br />Well in fact I do that too, but if more sprites are used you still take slightly less time to clear the end of OAM buffer (set unused sprites' coordinates to $f0) and significantly more time to draw the visible sprite, resulting in more CPU being used.<br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"><br /><br />I really think this is the fault of the approach you selected to handle the sprite cycling. I'm sure there are less CPU-intensive ways. I'm not saying your solution is bad though... As long as you can get the game to run without (much) slowdown, it's perfect.</div>
<br />I didn't even mention sprite cycling. For my game priorities are important so I can't just draw them in any order, (I have to first sort the object before drawing them) which makes things slower, but that wasn't what I was talking about.
<br />
<br />My routine which mases sprites is actually quite fast and I can handle a good deal of enemies without lagging (in fact I think I couldn't make it faster than what I did, but I might be wrong). What I was saying tough, is that more sprites on the screen DOES imply significantly more CPU time, while you were saying that there was no relation between both. Even if you made the routine fast, if it's called 40+ times in a frame it will still be significant, as for each sprite in a metasprite it will have to position it on the screen, check if it is off-screen, test if it is flipped, etc...

<br />
<br />After every sprite is written to the oam buffer, there is a routine that changes every pair of coordinates from 16-bit to 8-bit that also deals with offscreen sprites.

<br />I chose ADDing just in case the same sprite patterns are located at a different spot of v-ram depending on the level.

<br />Ah OK. I only EOR the attribute byte (flipping, palette, priority), the pattern index can be added to something in my case too. The coordinates can't be overridden though (I don't see the point).

<br />In my current project I have manually masked out several scanlines at the top of the screen (like <em>Super Cars</em> does), something that serves 3 purposes:
<br />
<br /><ul><li>provide extra time for VRAM updates;</li><li>hide vertical scrolling glitches;</li><li>allow sprites to scroll smoothly from the top of the screen;</li></ul>
<br />The last purpose is actually just a bonus for me, I'm not that annoyed by sprites "popping", at least not the small sprites the NES uses (I'm sure I'd be annoyed if a large 32x32-pixel sprite couldn't scroll in/out smoothly).

<br />It appears you would hate the Super NES, which has a 224-pixel-tall screen and 240-pixel-tall maps. You'd hate the Game Boy Advance even more, with a 240x160 pixel screen and 256x256 pixel maps. I guess GBA games and those NES games that use the window treat each screen of the map as "overscannable".

<br />I was 100% sure someone (most likely you) would bring this up, I was just waiting.
<br />
<br />Even the NES has a 240-pixel tall screen and maps. At least all these dimensions are divisible by 16, not nearly as annoying as 248 IMO. The GBA scores some points for having 256x256-pixel maps, that makes them much easier to handle. I wish the NES could have stored it's tile attributes somewhere else (some internal memory like the OAM or palette RAM).

<br />Use MMC5's Exended attributes then.
<br />
<br />Otherwise, I really don't see the problem with having the screen not being a power of two. I guess you just made this one up.
<br />
<br />I am in fact quite annoyed by sprite pop-up on NES games, but you eventually get used to this. And on the countrary of what you said, it looks "better" if an enemy or object entierely pop up at once than if individual tiles of it pop up every 8 pixels.

I much prefer individual sprites popping up rather than whole objects. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V5Uqd5-p2Y" class="postlink">Here's a video of a game where whole objects pop in</a>.

First I was talking about the screen, and when tepples mentioned the GBA I said that although its screen dimensions aren't perfect it gets points for its tilemap.<br /><br />I don't like clipping the leftmost column on the NES because hiding a piece of the map that actually exists doesn't feel right to me, and if I were to show it, the scrolling logic would be kinda weird with the camera having to go beyond the level boundary (level decoding could get glitchy, there would be extra problems to deal with).<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">No I don't really like it.

<br />But which do you dislike less? I think that a whole character popping up draws too much attention, much more than its small pieces would as it was progressively drawn.
