Once I get to actually implementing it, I will write the algorithm and then try to optimize it.<br /><br />The code that you linked to is not really something that seems to apply to my own attempt. I would not work with any kind of RGB color at all and I wouldn't have any lookup tables.<br /><br />I would simply do the following:<br /><br />For all 16 (or 13, depending on what's faster) colors, do the following:<br /><br />Take the current value.<br />Take the new value.<br />Take the high nibble of each.<br />Calculate the way that has to be walked from one color to the other to reach the other one.<br />The values in this case go from high nibble 1 to high nibble C (not 0 to F). This has to be taken care of.<br />Calculate how many scrolling frames we will have and calculate scrollingFrames / colorSteps to find out after how many frames the color needs to be adjusted.<br /><br />Do a similar thing with low nibble, i.e. brightness.<br /><br />And then apply the colors during the correct scrolling frames.<br /><br />This takes 16 x 6 bytes in RAM that have to exist beyond function calls:<br />For each color:<br />The current value.<br />The destination value.<br />Indicator whether the high nibble is incremented or decremented.<br />Indicator whether the low nibble is incremented or decremented.<br />The number of frames until the high nibble is incremented or decremented.<br />The number of frames until the low nibble is incremented or decremented.<br /><br />Maybe some more values for special treatment of gray to color and color to gray.

Not that this is a technical limitation or anything, but if there's a way to do something in a simpler way even though it's technically &quot;false&quot;, but still does the job, it's common for 80's games to take this path.<br /><br />This is why I first mentioned cycling hues in a fixed direction, regardless of the values. This also has the advantage of handling the special case of hue=0, as it'll jump to either hue=C or hue=1 without any additional code. The disadvantage is that this does not take the shortest parth, for instance if your preferred direction is increasing hues, and you want to switch from hue=6 to hue=5, you'll rotate through the whole palette instead of going there directly. It's still a gradual change of colour, but the effect is different. Final Fantasy 1 does exactly that when entering in the menu or a shop.<br /><br />If the shortest path is calculated I'd suggest treat &quot;0&quot; as a normal hue and make it jump to &quot;1&quot; or &quot;C&quot; column, to eventually reach the destination column, is probably closer to the &quot;NES&quot; way to do it, rather than having extra code for that particular case. Extra code does not seem to be avoidable if gray column or black is the target colour, though, but I believe the normal algorithm can extend rather naturally to those colours if used as start colours.

I'll ave to see what it looks like, which won't happen in the next weeks since I first have to program more important stuff.<br /><br />I also thought about treating column 0 as a regular column, in the way that the color gray moves through blue and cyan, which might look pretty natural.<br />Although, in this case, I would still skip column 0 whenever non-gray colors are concerned.<br /><br /><br />Are there any other NES games that use gradual color changes to switch from one region to another?

You can apply any color to it anyway.<br />But in &quot;Ninja Gaiden&quot;, you don't have a source palette and a destination palette and then a bunch of in-between palettes that you can analyze to find out what algorithm they used to turn the dark yellow of screen 1 into light pink of screen 2.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">Bregalad wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">Mega Man's ending have an animation with the sun setting down, however I doubt the palette values are not simply pre-calculated.</div><br />Yeah, that's not the same situation anyway: You have a single scene and this scene is shown in different colors that are all valid scene colors: Every shade really represents a certain time frame of the scene.<br /><br />But my situation is: You have two different <em>actual</em> color palettes. And now the game gradually switches between both palettes by shortly showing intermediate <em>virtual</em> versions.<br />These intermediate versions are not supposed to indicate that the scene ever looked like that.<br />(If I have a green plant in one screen and a purple roof in another screen that simply occupies the same index in the palette, this doesn't mean that the roof was ever brown, just because my scene switch effect cycles through these colors.)<br /><br />That's not the same as in the &quot;Mega Man&quot; ending where <em>every</em> shade is supposed to be a full representation of the scene at a specific point in time.<br />So, there's nothing to analyze here, from an algorithm point of view.<br /><br /><br />And the color change in &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; when entering the menu or a shop is just some general color cycling before the screen completely fades to black. The source colors don't transform into destination colors, they simply blink a bit before everything goes dark and a completely new, unrelated scene is created from scratch.<br /><br /><br />I would need something like this, but in an NES game:<br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YzEU19PUVuE&amp;t=13m19s">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YzEU19PUVuE&amp;t=13m19s</a><!-- m -->
