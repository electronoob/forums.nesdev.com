<br />A C program is a set of subroutines, the kind you call with JSR in 6502. The "int main()" tells where a subroutine starts; "int" means that it leaves an 'int' (whole number) in the accumulator for the calling subroutine to pick up. When you do this:
<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">int main&#40;&#41; &#123;<br />&nbsp; puts&#40;&quot;hello world&quot;&#41;;<br />&nbsp; return 0;<br />&#125;</div><br />It compiles to something like this:<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">.proc main<br />.segment &quot;CODE&quot;<br /><br />&nbsp; ; puts&#40;&quot;hello world&quot;&#41;;<br />&nbsp; lda #&lt;helloStr<br />&nbsp; sta 0<br />&nbsp; lda #&gt;helloStr<br />&nbsp; sta 1<br />&nbsp; jsr puts<br /><br />&nbsp; ; return 0;<br />&nbsp; lda #0<br />&nbsp; rts<br />.segment &quot;RODATA&quot;<br />helloStr: .asciiz &quot;hello world&quot;<br />.endproc</div>
<br />It's called "main" because every executable compiled with C contains a bit of reset code that does "JSR main".

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I'm sorry, the explanation of the "Int" leaves me still confused. What do you mean by "the calling subroutine"? I just don't see why "Int" needs to be there. That's short for integer, right?
<br />
<br />And about the picture. I could shrink it in photoshop, it's just that it would turn out distorted, and may not even look like what I drew in the first place. I think drawing it small to start out would be better. When I first shrunk my painting, I could barely tell what I was looking at. I of course had to trace over the whole thing again.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Oh, my Celius it's amazing how you're able to Nintendoize images ! I couldn't do it look that good. I've nintendoized some portrait as well, always ending with mediocre results. The best way I found is to do it in black and white, and do the colors by hand. Did you did this ?
<br />
<br />And yes, as for small enemies and so it's always beter to do them by hand. You'd want to draw them before to know what you're doing, but still draw the pixels by hand. I may be wrong tough.
<br />
<br />And why would a reset code return something ? Since nobody ever calls the rest code (aka main procedure). I trought a main procedure would always be void type and never have any argument, else it really make no sense.
