		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />the short verison, I'd like to use the new dw3 translation on my snes copier (I believe it to be capable of 48mbit files)
<br />
<br />i've spent several hours fiddling with it (let me tell you ...copying 7 floppydisks over and over again is a pain.
<br />
<br />but i'm running into a snag, for my copier to work you need to split the files up, not a big deal right? snestool does it just fine.
<br />
<br />but the problem i'm running into is ,when I split the rom into however many parts then try loading it up in an emulator it craps itself and dies.
<br /> (same when I try to move it over to the copier itself)
<br />
<br />i've tried splitting it  into 1 meg files, as well as smaller 512k files, and I get the same problem.
<br />
<br />is there some magical secret i'm missing? or can snestool just not function with such a large file?
<br />
<br />
<br />any help would be apreciated!

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />It would help to know what copier you have. If it's Game Doctor SF you need to convert it to it's format and then split it. If it's something else like Pro Fighter you need to convert it to fig. Splitting the file should be as simple as that, splitting the file. The copier should just be reading the backup header and then reading disks until it gets all the data. On GD SF copiers you can use 1.6MB floppies to split games into 12mbit parts which is quite handy since 24mbit games take 2 floppies rather than 3, and 32mbit take 3 rather than 4.

<br />
<br />I was able to split the japanese rom just fine and it worked fine in an emualtor and on the copier, but when I try to split the working patched rom it won't run in either, hence my dilema.

<br />
<br />Also BTW it seems like I remember few (if any) of my split GD format roms would load in an emulator.

<br />
<br />Emulators don't generally crap out like that with smaller expanded sizes but larger it is possible. Anyway, the Game Doctor definitely wouldn't like that 32mb to 48mb unless you change the internal rom header's rom size byte.
