		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />So I got the programmer I ordered finally, and I've been having trouble getting it to show any signs of working correctly. It's supposed to be a Willem EPROM programmer. "Dual Power USB" or some such crap. 
<br />
<br />Anyway, I have many EPROMs that are blank and a chip that is known to have been programmed. However no matter what I do, it reads everything as 00s. I have no idea what I could be doing wrong. It passed the hardware test in that it knows it is present. I set the dip switches up as it showed on screen. But still it says nothing but zeroes. And attempts to write fail. 
<br />
<br />The chip types I have are a programmed 27c801, 12 erased 27c010s and 4 27c020s. Also I have a 27C256. It is my understanding if the ROM were blank it would be all FFs. I've tried using external power and it did not seem to help (9vdc). Any ideas?

<br />
<br />Does your programmer have a parallel port on it?   If so, maybe there is a way to make sure that the port or the cable are functioning properly. 
<br />
<br />I dont even have a parallel port on my main computer which is one of the reasons I ended up getting a different programmer.
<br />
<br />Edit- you can probably ignore my post.  I re-read and saw that yours passed the hardware test.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I bought a Top2005  programmer.   It doesnt pester you with dip switches either but I've encountered problems with it too.
<br />
<br />My Willem dual   worked OK with all my EPROM and Flash chips except for some 2 Mb Flash chips.   I tried on the willem and mcumall forums and they said they thought the chips were bad which the werent.
<br />
<br />My Top2005 works fine with all my EPROM and Flash chips (including those 2 Mb ones) but not with my Atmel 32KB flash chips. (or at least thats the only chip I've tried thats given me problems).  
<br />I have no idea why.  So I usually just use eproms since I  own an eraser anyways.  
<br />
<br />If anyone's got a problem free programmer (for both flash and eproms) I'd love to know what it is.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Well I'm just looking for something cheap that will work via USB. Ideally I'd like to be able to program EPROM and FlashROMs that I'd use in NES and also SNES&amp;Genesis. But the NES is the most important part. I'm pretty pissed off at the programmer I've got now as no matter what I do it doesn't seem to work. The only thing left to try really is a whole different PC. I don't have another PC in one piece so I can't really so anything there.
