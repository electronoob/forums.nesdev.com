The Turbo Chameleon 64 is seen as a top of the line product for the C64 (likely due to its accurate emulation of the 1541 in addition to its multitude of other features, but also its VGA output), so I don't see a reason why we couldn't have a comparable top of the line product for SNES, and assuming accuracy, I don't see people minding the fact that the PPUs are emulated with an FPGA.<br /><br />Also a quick look at the schematics show that all the data lines connecting the CPU and PPU1 together are available through the expansion port. Whether this would be enough to be able to replace PPU1 and PPU2 with FPGA replacements using the expansion port is unknown to me, as I do not develop hardware, but if it is, this could be a viable solution.<br /><br />Assuming the price is &lt;$100 or so, it would be a cheaper alternative to the Super NT that I'm sure people would be willing to buy (similar to how people still use the NESRGB and HiDef NES instead of just buying an NT Mini). And I don't think I need to elaborate on why cheapo clone consoles aren't a proper solution.<br /><br />Hell, even the fat 1CHIPs have the same expansion port, so it might be possible to replace the integrated PPU1/PPU2 with more accurate FPGA versions, although I'm not sure how many people will want it for that purpose as the 1CHIPs already output good video (after proper attenuation).

Color blending still doesn't happen using RGB on a 3CHIP, and I fail to see upsides to smearing the whole picture without having that. And if people want color blending, they should use composite anyway. I, for one among many others, prefer to use RGB even on games like Sonic where the developers intended the use of a composite output. This is especially the case since many developers used RGB on a PVM to develop their games, making this argument only apply to some games. Also the SNES had true transparency as a result of color math. And blending hi-res 512x224 graphics together is already possible without quality loss (see: emulators and Super NT).<br /><br />I wouldn't be too sure that a blurry image was Nintendo's original intention when designing the SNES, and it is impossible to say that every game developer developed their games with the intention that the gamer would be using composite output, especially since the SNES supported S-Video and RGB.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">lidnariq wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">Honestly, those aren't The Hard Or Interesting Part.<br /><br />Nevermind that S-CPUs seem to be what die the most readily anyway.</div><br />In my experience, PPU2 seems to die the most (I have a few consoles with dead PPU2s and only 1 with a dead CPU), but that's anecdotal.
