		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I think this thread has some potential as everyone here has a story with when they got their consoles and such. Here is mine. <br /><br />1st) NES - Got it back in the 80's and played it until I got an SNES<br /><br />2nd ) SNES - Played it in the 90's when I was young, remember seeing DKC and sh*tting in my pants<br /><br />3rd) N-64 - I remember renting one at Blockbuster before x-max time and I remember being so excited to play one. Got one x-mas day on the release year and was super happy<br /><br />4th) Sega Genesis - for Easter from my parents<br /><br />5th) Playstation - for the next year's Easter <br /><br />6th) Dreamcast - got one from a pawn shop for only one reason.... to play Capcom vs SNK this was around 2002<br /><br />7th) XBOX - Got invited to a Halo party and literally the next day I went into a pawn shop and picked up an original Xbox with Halo 1 for around $120<br /><br />8th) Atari 7800 - Got into retro video games and purchased my friends old 7800 and some games for around $40<br /><br />9th) TI 99 4A - Got one off of e-bay and it didn't work, ordered another one and swapped parts until I finally pieced together a fully functing 99-4A. Also got the sega genesis controller adapter for like $50 (had to get that)<br /><br />10th) Jaguar - Went to goodwill store and saw an atari Jaguar for like $12.99. I bought it and it worked perfectly! <br /><br />11th) Arcade Machine - Purchased a Street Fighter 2 champ ed full sized arcade machine off craigslist for $350. Its in okay shape, needs a little work, but its my baby!<br /><br /><br />Where they are at now?<br /><br />NES - I have no idea where my original NES is. The one that I have now is actually my Aunts, who purchased one of the later models for Kirby. Since she stopped playing it years and years ago I have now taken ownership of it and gave it a nice home. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />SNES - Yep still have my original SNES.<br /><br />Playstation 1 - I can't remember how it broken, but it did and so the system is long gone. <br /><br />Dreamcast - My original Dreamcast machine still kinda of works, but it turns off randomly on me sometimes. I ended up picking up a black version at a garage sale for $3 and that one works perfectly. <br /><br />Xbox - A few years back I got out my old original Xbox and tried to start it up. The system was giving me a hard time and not wanting to open the tray for the game and unfortunately I lost my temper and just smashed the whole system by throwing it around my house. I have now purchased a new original xbox and haven't had any problems. <br /><br />I also had an original gameboy and a gameboy advanced, but I don't know where they are. <br /><br />Interestingly I haven't purchased any newer systems like xbox 360 or PS3 or PS4. I guess I just like the look and feel of older games. I've been wanting to get some newer systems, but just haven't gotten them yet.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Gee, I wonder where you got this idea from... (just kidding)<br /><br />Anyway, here goes nothing.<br /><br />When I was about 4 or something (I don't remember) I got my SNES from my cousin, who was actually born in 1993. I don't know the year the SNES was made or any of the history behind it, but based on the Lion King game, the SNES's CPU number is 2, PPU1's number is 1, and PPU2's number is 3, whatever that means. Until about 3 years ago, my SNES sat in the mineshaft my family calls a garage, waiting to be unearthed...<br /><br />I then got my N64 about literally a year later from the same cousin. (He actually regrets giving this one away! <img src="./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" /> ) I have always had my N64 and played it regularly, but unfortunately, it is at my father's house in Virginia...<br /><br />I then got 2 GameCube's. (one at my mothers house and one at my fathers house) I have the one at my father's hooked up and I play it, but the one at my mother's house is in my closet. (I could easily get it out if I wanted to.)<br /><br />I then got 2 Wiis, and then got a third one latter. (yes, I know that's crazy.) I don't play it at all really. (Too much shovel ware.)<br /><br />I then got an Xbox 360. I find it amazing how that console almost completely changed its feel from when it was originally released all the way up to now. (It was a much better console then, IMO) I remember playing Halo 3 with my buddies. Good times...<br /><br />Only about 2 years ago, I got an NES I bought on eBay. I like it a lot, and it even came with the box! The NES itself is in good condition too, and I don't have to mess with it too much.<br /><br />I then got a Sega Genesis Model 2 a little latter at a video game store, where they gave us the wrong AC adapters <em>twice</em>! I actually have memories of playing the Sega Genesis with my Grandma because my cousin (a different one from earlier) had a Model 1 Genesis. My grandmother and I often played Sonic 2, where shed be Sonic and I'd be Tails. (I really sucked.) I remember she actually got us all the way to the boss on Metropolis Zone! <img src="./images/smilies/icon_eek.gif" alt=":shock:" title="Shocked" /> <br /><br />My sister (I have one) got an X bone for Christmas, and to be completely honest with you, I really haven't even bothered touching it. None of the games for it look the slightest bit interesting to me.<br /><br />What <em>should</em> be coming latter is a Neo Geo MVS, (board only) but I'm going to look into it a bit, because I originally thought you could just plug it into the TV. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt=":roll:" title="Rolling Eyes" /><br /><br />I don't really remember way too much about portables, but I got a Gameboy Pocket and a Gameboy Color from my cousin (the one that gave me the SNES and N64) and I got a GBA latter from my grandmother, (the one that played Sonic with me) which was the first system I got brand new. The first game I got for it was Sonic Advanced 2, and I was terrible at it, so I would give it to my grandmother and tell her to beat a boss or something. (Which she would do, because she was actually a pretty good Sonic player.) I latter got a DS lite, which broke because I literally opened it one day and then got a DSi and then a 3DS, that I only play on occasion. Through other cousins and finding good deals, I now have 3 GBCs, 2GBAs, 3GBA SPs, and a normal DS.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Let me try to remember<br /><br />NES<br />Genesis<br />Playstation<br />N64<br />Playstation 2<br />Gamecube<br />SNES<br />Wii<br />XBox 360<br />PS3<br /><br />I remember playing my NES before I had even reached my first birthday (my parents recorded me playing Disney's Adventures in The Magic Kingdom), so I've been gaming all of my life. The next console we owned was the Genesis. I had no idea what my dad was buying at Toys 'R Us that day, but that's when I first met Sonic The Hedgehog. Needless to say I was a Sonic fan (until recent years; if it's not obvious enough why just look at his games...) We got stuck on the Genesis for a loooong time (I remember playing it still when the 1st episode of Spongebob Squarepants aired) but we got a PS1 in like '97 or '98. Lots of Spyro the Dragon games were played. I didn't actually get an N64 until very, very late in its lifetime. My dad saw that I was doing well at the local Pokemon TGC League (which happened to be in a Toys 'R Us), so he just up and bought us an N64. He refused to buy me Perfect Dark, probably because of the $70 price tag rather than the M rating.<br /><br />I really wanted a Gamecube since I was practically born and raised on the NES, but for years we had a PS2 instead (which I loved). But I also loved Nintendo and Melee was calling me. I was only in middle school, so I had to save up my own money to buy the Metroid Prime bundle. The Wii is actually my sister's, and we probably own more games for it than any other console. My computer was meant to run the Dolphin emulator, so it goes without saying that it's one of the consoles I treasure the most. I bought a 360 solely to play Halo (the Campaign modes too, multiplayer is not my thing), but I'm glad I got to play Tales of Vesperia and Star Ocean 4 (not so glad I got to play Infinite Undiscovery...) I got a PS3 hoping it would prove to be a JRPG machine like the PS2 was, but I was really disappointed. Only really played Tales of Xillia on it, but a PS3 was worth MGS4, even if it's more movie than game.<br /><br />Most of my consoles are sitting together in one spot in our family's house. Whenever we want to play something, we just hook up the right cables and go to it. The only thing is that I can't find my NES. I last saw it when we moved, it should have been with the Genesis. It's probably in the nexus of clutter that has become my closet.

And any classic console which is overpriced.<br /><br />Fun fact:  I totally skipped the Gameboy Color yet bought Link's Awakening DX two years before the GBA came out, and only then did I play the color dungeon.
