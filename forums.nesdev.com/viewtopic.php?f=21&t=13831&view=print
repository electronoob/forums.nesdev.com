The stairs extend into the Z-axis by moving horizontally to the left.<br /><br />I think the simplest way to address this is just to pick a consistent method of conveying three dimensional space and stick with that. If something extends into the background by angling down and right, then draw all objects the same way. There are more complicated things you could do where it would vary, for example, drawing with a 1-point perspective, but I think that would be more difficult, and would also make it harder to reuse tiles.<br /><br />Personally, I don't think the back of the shelves should be pink. It really confuses what is on the wall behind and what is a foreground object. I had trouble figuring out what those were.<br /><br />I could see using the background color for the stairs being a valid game design decision only if they are in the background and not interacted with. If your character can walk on those stairs then I strongly feel they should be a different color.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />It's looking better, for sure.<br /><br />You might want to try editing the colors on the face of the book case so that you can reverse the color between book spines and the inside of the shelves. I feel like it would better differentiate the side of the book case from the face if the predominant color in the face was the dark brown. But maybe the biggest reason is just the fact that the exposed spines will get more light than the covered shelves. Likewise, the front of the shelves (the edges that are dark brown) would get more light exposure than the parts on the inside.<br /><br />If the stairs aren't a part of the game environment then it makes sense that you made them blend into the background. The perspective is still backwards from the shelves though.<br /><br />edit: minor typo. shelves to stairs
