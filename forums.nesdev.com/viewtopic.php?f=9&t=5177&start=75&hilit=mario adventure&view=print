<br />
<br />You won't be able to just disable it, SMB3 needs it.  
<br />
<br />(perhaps you meant enable it?)
<br />
<br />Either way your only real option is to get a TSROM board so you have the WRAM for SMB3.   You could add WRAM to TLROM like I said earlier but it would most likely be a mess.  Basically converting TLROM to TSROM.
<br />
<br />And like tepples is saying, chances are the games that don't use the WRAM (games that originally used TLROM) won't care that there's actually WRAM there and they'll ignore it.  So with that assumption all you'll need to do is use your reset bankswitch circuit for all the rom images.

<br />You can't "disable" it. The whole game was programmed to used that extra memory, which makes it essential for the game to work. Since the game was programmed to work with 10KB of RAM, you can't expect the same program to work with just 2KB.
<br />
<br />The game could probably be reprogrammed from scratch to use only 2KB of RAM, but that would require an insane amount of work without any real reward, so I doubt anyone would want to do it.
<br />
<br />It would be much, much, much simpler to just add the SRAM to the cart. The wiki has some information about how to do it.

<br />That or a fake-MMC3 mapper that spreads the A12 rises by 60 or so dots instead of the roughly 12 dots of authentic MMC3. That will count as expected unless all eight sprites on a given line are from $0000-$0FFF.

<br />Maybe the game needs a palette hack to update it to the newer color sets.

<br />OK thanks. Yep, the IRQ problem is definitely there (fortunately it doesn't make the game completely unplayable, at least in that specific case). BTW I didn't mean to imply there was no problem with the IRQ, just wasn't sure if it was supposed to occur right away or later on in the game.
<br />
<br />So, if somebody feels up to the task, change the mapper to VRC6 (shouldn't be too hard if the IRQ is only used for the status bar), pad the CHR to 256 KB and fix the WRAM initialization code. To clarify on my earlier quote, the game never clears 7000-7FFF, yet expects *some* of the values in there to be 0. It's not OK to clear all of it unless you want to lose the ability to save altogether.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Two years later and this thread is still alive...amazing in any board really, but I have some good news for everyone.
<br />
<br />Last night I was experimenting with my copynes and a newly aquired burner (Genius G540) when I noticed somthing odd about a previously problematic game. <span class="posthilit">Mario</span> in Some Usual day started working on my TSROM board suddenly...So I figured that since it was behaving interestingly I'd give the other known problematic SMB3 Hack, <span class="posthilit">Mario</span> <span class="posthilit">Adventure</span>, a run for it's money. To my surprise it worked...suddenly, it dawned on me...I was using other games that were writing to the WRAM in the cart, that may have initialized them just right so that these 'problematic' titles could operate. So I experimented a little bit...I loaded the WRAM with a fill of FF, and <span class="posthilit">Mario</span> <span class="posthilit">Adventure</span> started doing it's usuall music rant with a black screen...then I filled the same WRAM with 00, and lo and behold, it started playing.
<br />
<br />Checking the WRAM init code, it appears that only 6FFF-6000 are erased to 00 (I believe this point was already made in this topic), however, the upper half of the WRAM is untouched (except 7D00-7DFF when erasing a save via UP + Select at 'PRESS START').
<br />
<br />I've completed a patch that redirects the WRAM initialization code to a code cave with more space so that I can initialize 7FFF-7E00, then 7CFF-6000, fixing the issue.
<br />
<br />Additionally, I've added a check to WRAM byte 7DD6. It appears to be unused, but zeroed when erasing the save. This is a failsafe in case the save somehow becomes corrupted, but is not foolproof. It will erase the save if the value at 7DD6 is not 0.
<br />
<br />The suspect bytes 7A55 freezes the game with any value other than 0 (mabye pause flag?) and 7AF7 controls some loop in the music code (needs to be 0 on init to work properly).
<br />
<br />Here's a zip file with two versions of the ips file (one for a PRG-ROM binary, and one for a .NES file. It doesn't matter if your nes file has the CHR expanded of course).
