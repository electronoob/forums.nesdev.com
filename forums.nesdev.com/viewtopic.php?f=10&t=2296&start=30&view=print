<br />Not exactly. In order to be appreciated, PC games need to be either 1. short casual games that can be played in ten minutes through a Java applet, or 2. adventures with 3D graphics. If you want to make an adventure with 2D graphics, the DirectX platform isn't really for you.

<br />This is a completly valid point of view (although it's not yours it could very well be someone else's). What I wrote about respecting ROM hackers for the trouble they go through was also my sincere opinion. These are all different, but valid, point of views. As long as everyone respect other's opinons, we'll be fine! =)
<br />
<br />When I tell people that my hobby is making games for a 20 year old system, I get a lot of frowning, but I don't care. All that matters is how that work is important for me, and makes me feel good.

And the whole thing is a wort of art, so code, graphics, gameplay musicm oveall ambiance and whathever anyother factory you want to take in consideration all build together to make ONE work of art (and not four or five separate work of arts, as many people seems to belive).

Before, it's almost as if you were saying graphics are bad unless they animate -- which is why I brought up the other examples of stationary graphics. </div><br />In DW for example you see the battle trough the main protagonit's eyes, and this work pretty well. In Final Fantasy, you see your lovely characters animated funily, and the monster are static, but it is "less important" because you'll care less about enemies than about your protagonists.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">As has already been brought up -- game companies recycle old code (and even sell their code to other companies) all the time. I'm even sure that this was fairly common in NES days. </div><br />Yes, they recycle *code*. They doesn't recycle the compiled final product ! That is two different things ! Because it's easy to modify code to get your hand on everything, it's hard to modify a comiled hex file to do this ! That's the main reason why I'm against major romhacking.<br />And also I found it's a horrible idea to recycle someone else's code or buying it it without even understanding it, and too many people does that !<br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">In that case it would be easy to get rid of the limitations: quit the NESdev scene in favor of the gbadev scene.

<br />How will I be able to make good 16-bit games if I'm not even able to make good 8-bit games ?

<br />Not that this is a big deal or anything, but I believe that the GBA is a 32-bit system! =)

<br />
<br />Actually, definitions of "xx-bit systems" are pretty pointless, since no matter what definition you choose to apply (external data bus size, internal register size etc), you'll always disagree with common definitions of which systems are what. The definitions are particularly pointless when applying them to video game systems, where the CPU is always secondary to the graphics chip(s).
<br />
<br />In reality, marketing is the only factor that decides if a system gets put in the 8-bit, 16-bit or 32-bit bucket.
