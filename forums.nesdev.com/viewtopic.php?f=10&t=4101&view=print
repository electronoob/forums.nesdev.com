		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Right now I am working on updating a small number of tiles in a nametable, and have ran into a couple of snags.
<br />
<br />What I have are two tables that I would like to use. One table represents the address to be used in $2006:
<br />
<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">filltopleft:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;.byte $20,$66,$20,$67,$20,$68,$20,$69<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;.byte $20,$86,$20,$87,$20,$88,$20,$89<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;.byte $20,$a6,$20,$a7,$20,$a8,$20,$a9<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;.byte $20,$c6,$20,$c7,$20,$c8,$20,$c9<br /></div><br /><br />... where each byte would be stored in $2006 one at a time (I might be able to simplify this part by just writing $20 to the first one, and having the none-$20 values in the table).<br /><br />The next table is for the tiles that I want to fill those areas of the PPU:<br /><br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">x_tiles:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;.byte $80,$81,$00,$83<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;.byte $00,$91,$92,$93<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;.byte $00,$a1,$a2,$a3<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;.byte $b0,$b1,$00,$b3<br /></div><br /><br />Now, I can get a few to show up, but the code is OBVIOUSLY not going to be optimal, because I can't figure out a good way to get both to index. For my initial tests, I did this:<br /><br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">&nbsp; &nbsp;lda filltopleft<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;sta $2006<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;lda filltopleft+1<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;sta $2006<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;lda x_tiles<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;sta $2007<br /></div>
<br />
<br />I have 12 different tiles that will need to be updated upon a button press (this is in NMI, as was recommended to me earlier in IRC), so it would be really bad to do that 12 times. I cannot figure out a good way to do it though :/  If anyone can give me some direction, or some addressing modes to look into, I'd appreciate it.
<br />
<br />My second snag is the original nametable itself. After manipulating it as above, the whole nametable seems to shift down a couple/few pixels. I found <a href="http://nesdev.com/bbs/viewtopic.php?p=4776#4776" class="postlink">a post by Disch</a> that says to write to the scroll after doing the updates, which helped to stop the entire original nametable from shifting WAY off from the original placement, but it still shifts a tad now. I'm not sure how to keep it stable. If there are any ideas on what I'm not doing correctly, any insight would be appreciated!

But I don't think this is necessary, since 12 tiles is not that much, and you should be fine with a loop. Just break you address table into 2, one for the high bytes and one for the lower ones, so that you can access all the information with the same index. Or get rid of the high bytes, if they're all $20 like you said. The loop would look something like this:<br /><br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">&nbsp; &nbsp;ldx #11<br />copy_tiles:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;lda filltopleftHi, x<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;sta $2006<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;lda filltopleftLo, x<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;sta $2006<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;lda x_tiles, x<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;sta $2007<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;dex<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;bpl copy_tiles</div><br /><br />By looking at you address table, I can see that the ones in the same row are consecutive addresses, so you could very well benefit from the auto-incrementing nature of the PPU address, and only set the address through $2006 once once for every 4 bytes written to $2007, saving you a lot of VBlank cycles. If you however want to use this code when the addresses are not consecutive, then this doesn't apply.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">My second snag is the original nametable itself.

<br />There is no reason for the position of the name table to be unstable if you correctly set the scroll (through $2000 and $2005) every frame during the VBlank period after you're done using $2006 and $2007. Just respect those rules and you'll be safe. Are you sure you're respecting those rules? Are you sure your NMI code isn't taking to long and going past VBlank time?

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Thanks Tokumaru! I got about the same recommendation from someone else earlier, and it seems to work great. I'm not sure why I didn't think to apply X three times over like that. I did however get rid of the hi address and just loaded a #$20, which works just fine. 
<br />
<br />About the screen moving deal, I learned that I should be writing to 2006 and 2005 at the end of NMI, which I didn't know about prior to that specific problem. Learn something new everyday!
<br />
<br />Thanks for your time man!

<br />Note that if everything is done correctly, there is no need to use $2006. The lower 2 bits of $2000 and the 2 values written to $2005 are enough to perfectly define the screen position. In fact, if you rely on $2006 writes for that, you're gonna have a hell of a hard time when you decide to implement scrolling in your demo, because the coordinates must be pretty scrambled to be converted into the desired $2006 adress.
<br />
<br />So it's just a suggestion, but you really should try ang get it working by writing only to $2000 and $2005. Doing it at the end of your NMI is fine. The only requirements is that you perform the writes to $2000 and $2005 after you finished all PPU operations and still inside VBlank time.
<br />
<br />I say that because $2000 and $2005 are the registers that were designed for the purpose of positioning the screen, while $2006 was designed to set the PPU address register. Because it sets the address, it has the <strong>side effect</strong> of partially positioning the screen, but it was not designed for that. It is the only way to reposition the screen during rendering though, but the programs that require this are usually already quite complex.
<br />
<br />I personally have a thing against experienced people suggesting newbies to write zeroes to $2006 just to get their screens stable, because although that may be a quick fix to the problem, <strong>it's not the correct way to do it</strong>, and the person doesn't get the hang of how scrolling works, they just learn to "clear $2006", which causes them a lot of trouble when they get to actual scrolling, because they didn't get it right the first time.

<br />EDIT: Didn't notice you asked about the order...
<br />
<br />Well, in my game (which scrolls around a lot), I first write to $2005 and then to $2000, and it works just fine. But I really don't think the order matters at all. The bits that are used for scrolling are only copied to the address register when the frame starts anyway, so as long as you do it before the frame starts, the order shouldn't matter.
<br />
<br />I don't see the need to write to $2001 every frame, because it doesn't have parameters altered by other PPU operations, like using $2006/$2007 affects the scroll. There is also no need to disable rendering during VBlank, it's safe to use $2006 and $2007 with rendering enabled if you do it during VBlank time. Because of this it's possible to get away with not writing to $2001 every frame. Unless you constantly change grayscale or color emphasis bits, but that's usually not the case. There is no side effect to writing to $2001 though, so you're free to do as you wish.
