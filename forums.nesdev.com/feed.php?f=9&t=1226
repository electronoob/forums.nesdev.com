Sure, fsc (color subcarrier) is f/6. But the PPU dot clock is f/4, and the CPU clock is f/12, and you can't skip these dividers without making new CPU and PPU ICs.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=9">tepples</a> — Fri May 07, 2010 11:14 am</p><hr />

I'm bringing this back from the dead because I've been doing some maintenance on my consoles... I added composite output to my SMS III, converted my Atari 2600 to NTSC (the guide I used for composite video resulted in colors that were too saturated so I reverted to RF), and now I feel like making my NES output NTSC video again.<br /><br />I found a <a href="http://www.nesarchive.net/forum/index.php?topic=11434.0" class="postlink">page in (bad) portuguese</a> that explains the whole procedure. It shows exactly what traces have to be reconnected and says that you have to replace the crystal with a 21.47727 MHz one. Thing is I can't find this crystal anywhere, but I have a 3.579545 MHz one (the same kind I used to make my Atari NTSC). IIRC, the 21.47727 MHz are divided to achieve the 3.579545 used in NTSC video, right? Does this mean that somehow I can bypass the divider and use my 3.579545 crystal?<br /><br />Please hardware gurus, let me know if you think this is possible and how.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=95">tokumaru</a> — Thu May 06, 2010 6:11 pm</p><hr />

Ok, I checked a few more things. I couldn't take any pictures because WinXP refused to detect my camcorder through the firewire port (tried for about an hour)...<br /><br />But I took a picture from the web and drew exactly where the seven wires that come from the added board are soldered to. It's <a href="http://www.nesstuff.kit.net/pal-m.jpg" class="postlink">here</a>. Please ignore the red arrows, they were meant for the guide where I stole the pic from.<br /><br />As it says in the picture, the trace leading to the spot where the yellow wire is connected has been cut. The board usually stays above the rest, on the right (when looking to this picture), and this NES had no shield covering everything. The added board has no large DIP IC.<br /><br />The part numbers for PPU and CPU are RP2C02G-0 and RP2A03G. Oh, and now that I looked again there's a sticker on the mainboard saying "NTSC". So yeah, I think it was NTSC.<br /><br />Maybe the board can be removed and a wire can reconnect the spots that had the trace cut?<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=95">tokumaru</a> — Thu Mar 16, 2006 7:58 am</p><hr />

I'm going to check all of this tomorrow 'cause that's when I have some free time to open the console again.<br /><br />I have strong reasons to believe it was NTSC. And PAL-M, as incredible as it may seem, is not 50Hz, it's 60Hz. Look <a href="http://www.videointerchange.com/pal_secam_conversions.htm#PAL" class="postlink">here</a>.<br /><br />Anyway, thanks for checking this out, and I'll sure look into the details you asked soon!<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=95">tokumaru</a> — Wed Mar 15, 2006 9:29 pm</p><hr />

Does the board tap the system's clock? Was the system NTSC in the first place? You probably have a 60hz NTSC unit which does transcode video to 50hz PAL-M, I have an unlicensed replacement PAL transcoder for NTSC Famicom which does this and presumably outputs PAL-I. If thats the case, you can just remove the board as long as it doesn't intercept anything from the main board (as my Famicom does) BTW, does the addon board contain a large DIP IC?<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=20">kyuusaku</a> — Wed Mar 15, 2006 4:25 pm</p><hr />

I bought myself a real NES console recently. However, it is the brazillian version. I outputs PAL-M signal, the kind used by television here (although newer TV's will work with anything).<br /><br />I'm not really into electronics, but I opened the thing and it has one extra board I have not seen in the pictures of open NES's on the net. This board has the year "1994" written on it. All the rest, however, seems to be from "1987". So it looks like Playtronic (the company that sold NES's here) took original NTSC consoles and put some kind of transcoder, to have the console output PAL-M.<br /><br />Do you guys know anything about consoles adapted to work with other TV standards? I don't know if the board could just be removed. I'll try and take pictures so you can see exactly the connections this board has to the console. Some wires connected to it are soldered to the main board, under the cart slot, and I vaguely remember some colored wires on the other side.<br /><br />Do you think maybe it is possible to turn this console back to outputing NTSC signal?<br /><br />Maybe if you look at some pictures you could tell if/how the board can be removed.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=95">tokumaru</a> — Wed Mar 15, 2006 12:24 pm</p><hr />
