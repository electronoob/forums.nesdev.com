		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I mean I cannot remember how many times I read on the net that some NES games are hard and almost impossible, while I consider myself not a very good gamer, especially when it comes to action games, I can still laugh at people saying those games are incredibly hard.
<br />
<br />Mega Man : Everyone say it is very hard for some reason, but I finished the game many times myself. Maybe its in fact one of the only Mega Man games I finished many times without cheating. Everyone say those gut's man platforms make the game impossible. But once you undersand how they work, I can almost pass them with the eyes closed. I mean come on this doesn't make the game hard. And all bosses are very easy, depsite the enemy in the room straight before them.
<br />
<br />Mega Man 2 : Everyone complains about the Quick Man's lazers to be hard. Maybe it's impressive the first time, but once you get the trick they are easy, and this game is even easier than MM1 is (at least for me who isn't a good action gamer). Why people keep saying it is hard ? On the other hand MM3 is a lot more difficult and nobody seem to mention it. Even MM4-6 are more difficult that this.
<br />
<br />Contra : Contra IS hard the first time, but with practice even I could finish the game, and that without using the 30 lives code everyone has been using a lot. Once you get all tricks and all, the game isn't that hard any longer.
<br />
<br />Battletoads : Okay, this game IS hard, but a lot people complain about level 3's bike, while I say they are hard the first time, once you get the trick, you can pass them without much problem, exept maybe the final section which get incredibly fast, but still, passing it isn't that hard. The Ice cavern after it is also mentionned to be hard The game gets insane, but later than most people seem to menition (from level 6 on I think).
<br />
<br />On the other hand there is many games I consider myself incredibly hard (SMB, SMB3, MM3 and +, Donkey Kong Country, Fire Emblem on the GBA) and that most people mention having finished it just like it would be a normal task. Am I the only bothered by this ?

<br />Definitely, but you lost your time to master one of the worst games ever released on the console, and one of the game who have the worst control of all times (only predecessed by AD&amp;D Heroes of the Lance, also for the NES).
<br />I don't mind games that are hard because of hard controls, but games that actually are hard. I found SMB (not hack the original one) very hard, while most people seems to talk like they master it. On the other hand I found Mega Man 1 easy and most people say it's impossible. Maybe it's just one quesion of habbit, I play Mega Man games much more often than SMB games for mainly personal tastes and the results show in practice.

<br />Tet&#1103;is speeds up much more slowly than Tetris does, and according to Ed Logg, programmer of Tet&#1103;is, <a href="http://www.atarihq.com/tsr/special/el/el.html" class="postlink">apparently this was intentional</a>.
<br />
<br />But can you beat <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jwC544Z37qo" class="postlink">Tetris without being able to see the blocks</a>?
<br />
<br />And can you beat the 10 foot songs on Dance Dance Revolution?

<br />
<br />I always liked the controlls of nes metroid they do not seem difficult of clumsy to me.
<br />
<br />The controls I hate is how Nintendo maps all their legacy controls wrong
<br />
<br />For example on the DS GBA A should be the actual B button and B should be Y, The same goes for the “classic” remote witch is only half good for SNES games
<br />
<br />Dose anyboady else hate this am much as me?
