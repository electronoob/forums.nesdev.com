<div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"><br />The game that you wanted to name me was probably going to be &quot;Roundball 2-on-2 Challenge&quot; since it's the only game that's not in the above basketball list.<br /></div><br />Nope.

But part of my confusion stems from what you're asking for NEVER being just that. This topic isn't about finding a list sortable by genres for famicom games (since you found one for NES). I would get that. <a href="http://www.gamefaqs.com/nes/list-43" class="postlink">It's not even about finding a list of all the sports games.</a> I'd probably get that. It's about finding one to locate specifically soccer and basketball games. Tennis/Volleyball/Track/Hockey are all excluded. Why? That's what makes me curious! The topics are always so narrow in scope that I feel like there MUST be a why behind them.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"><br />Checking FamicomWorld and NESGuide for all games that have the words &quot;Soccer&quot;, &quot;Cup&quot; or &quot;Goal&quot; in them, I could have done this myself.<br /></div><br />You could have searched for famicom genre sort too. Found the wikipedia links for Super Famicom games sorted various ways as the first and second result. Looked in the references for both and seen two sites that sort by genre. Like I just did.<br /><a href="http://www.gamefaqs.com/nes/list-43?page=1" class="postlink">Site one (linked above)</a><br /><a href="http://www.allgame.com/platform.php?id=19&amp;tab=games&amp;page=8&amp;sort=genre_ASC" class="postlink">Site two.</a> (It starts on a page sorted by genre, there are some shooters at the top, but the bottom and following pages are sports. It even listed a subtype that includes the sport.)<br /><br />And yes... you still have to do some work to find out which ones are soccer or basketball if you want a truly complete list. But that's kind of been my point since the beginning! When you want a thing just for you, you have to do SOME stuff to make it happen. I pointed out NES guide had one game mislabeled, these might be missing stuff in these too. If you care as deeply as you do about completeness the only real way is indeed to play all the games.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3504">Kasumi</a> — Sat Jun 21, 2014 1:10 pm</p><hr />

O.k., again: I didn't ask that anybody here lists me the soccer and basketball games. I was asking if there's a <em>complete</em> list somewhere. So, about your statement that threads should be useful for anybody: I guess a complete list of all the games with their specific genre etc. would be helpful to various people.<br />I know that I did ask for individual opinions in the past. But in this thread I specifically asked if there's a complete list, not if people can create a list for me. Because, let's be honest: Checking FamicomWorld and NESGuide for all games that have the words &quot;Soccer&quot;, &quot;Cup&quot; or &quot;Goal&quot; in them, I could have done this myself.<br /><br />The game that you wanted to name me was probably going to be &quot;Roundball 2-on-2 Challenge&quot; since it's the only game that's not in the above basketball list.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=6156">DRW</a> — Sat Jun 21, 2014 5:29 am</p><hr />

I will explain more clearly my issues with these topics.<br /><br />1. They dominate what you post about. <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/viewtopic.php?p=122282#p122282" class="postlink">This post by Tokumaru</a> describes how I feel. You want a list of X games, and ask us to fill it. Breakout-like games, the linked topic, all these sports games,  identical games on game boy and NES... <br /><br />2. There is no real room for discussion (most of the time), and this is a forum. In some of the topics you've created, you ask and then never participate in the topic again. (This makes it feel like we're doing things for you, not having a discussion with you.)<br /><br />3. There seems to be no point to having these lists beyond just having them. There is another website I know of which asks that users not to ask for information that is useful only to them. If it is useful only to you, it should be up to you to do the research. That's fair. It's true, there is no such statement here. But the idea resonates with me personally.<br /><br />Now: If you told me you wanted to make a website that rivals NES Guide, I would be happy to help you. I would &quot;get&quot; why you make these topics. <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/viewtopic.php?p=121254#p121254" class="postlink">I've asked</a> even before what I linked to earlier. And there was at least room for discussion, there.<br /><br />I see value in a person asking for programming help, because they are making something and I can help them with that. I'd see value in your Megaman topic if you were A: making a similar game and wanted to know which things were popular about which games, or B: if it was the only topic you've made of its kind. Because yes, sometimes it is fun to read opinions.<br /><br />I see no value in helping you make a list so you can have a list for an unspecified reason. The only thing I have EVER wanted to know in these topic is WHY YOU WANT THEM! If there is no why, why even ask? I would be happy to give you the one basketball game I know of that no one else has mentioned if I knew why you wanted it.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"><br />Yeah, obviously, you were totally missing the point<br /></div><br />This is exactly right. I have missed the point of the lists from the beginning. All I want is to know this. If the answer is, &quot;Just curious&quot;, I guess I'll never understand what drives you. If the answer is cooler, you get a basketball game for your list. Either way, I'll avoid these topics in the future.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3504">Kasumi</a> — Fri Jun 20, 2014 10:00 pm</p><hr />

Yeah, obviously, you were totally <em>missing</em> the point.

I was just asking if you know of a website that has these games collected.<br />O.k., you probably declare &quot;knowing of the website&quot; as &quot;researching the question&quot;. But seriously, already knowing of a website and posting the link isn't really research in the way the word is intended. After all, I didn't ask you: &quot;Can you please browse the Google results to see if you find a list?&quot;<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=6156">DRW</a> — Fri Jun 20, 2014 8:31 pm</p><hr />
