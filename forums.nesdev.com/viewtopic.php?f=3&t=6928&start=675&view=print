Games often rely on this synchronization in order to implement status bars and other sorts of mid-screen PPU effects (scroll changes, pattern changes, etc.), effects that will likely glitch if the CPU is overclocked.<br /><br />Emulators can cheat by providing an alternate &quot;overclocking&quot; method not possible on a real NES, which maintains the CPU/PPU synchronization until an entire frame goes by, and then halts the PPU for a while to give the CPU some extra time to process the game logic. This should work fairly well for games that time effects from the start of vblank or from the beginning of the frame, but may still break games that expect the time between frames to be that of the actual hardware.

I guess you could design your own NES clone from scratch with something like this, but this is definitely not a mod you can do to any console like overclocking is.

While bad timing could definitely affect MMC3 splits, an emulator could easily get around this by using scanline precision instead of pixel precision. FCEUX does something like this, I suppose, since it hardly shows any glitches near scroll splits.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />The reason people call it one of the most accurate is that it passes almost all test ROMs. Test ROMs haven't been made for every behavior, though.<br /><br />In what games does the FDS channel sound atrocious to you? I just compared the title screen music of Zelda no Densetsu against the recordings on the official The Legend of Zelda SOUND &amp; DRAMA album and the recent Zelda 30th Anniversary compilation, and Link no Bouken against the official Game Sound Museum release of the soundtrack and the 30th Anniversary album and it sounds pretty right. I think all of the official releases use modded Famicoms as sources because it sounds too clean and bright for RF, but that actually makes this a closer comparison with the emulator. Obviously, my review is not exhaustive.<br /><br />I'm not sure if this bug was reported earlier in the thread, but Lagrange Point's audio is higher in pitch the lower the sample rate is set, for some reason. According to the wiki, the VRC7's output rate is 49,716 Hz. I tried recording the audio with the emulator set to 48 kHz and, wondering if the pitch is off by the difference between the two sampling rates. I changed the playback rate downward by 1,716 Hz without sample rate conversion (to be clear, despite the chip's rate being higher, my recording needs to go down because the pitch is too sharp and increasing the rate to the chip's would make it even sharper) and compared it to the two official CD releases and it sounds right. Can you diagnose the problem, FHorse?

In the end of stage 4-4 of Ninja Gaiden you face 2 monsters that jump around and the Auto Frame Skip causes a stutter and it respawns the 2 monsters and then I was fighting 3 monsters. This has happened to me on this same boss 3 times. Is there any way I can manually turn off the Auto Frame Skip or change the Frame Skip to 0. Thanks For your help.
