Moved to writing test frameworks (<span class="posthilit">for</span> testing backend software) in Python and C#.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Well, &quot;love making games&quot; needs to be qualified. <span class="posthilit">You</span> have to find the process of making games acceptable; there's <span class="posthilit">a</span> lot of things that come with that which drive people (who otherwise passionately want to make games) out of the industry. There's better and worse companies to work at, but even at <span class="posthilit">a</span> good one, there's <span class="posthilit">a</span> lot of aspects of commercial game development that really stress out most people. I am just ballparking this, but I think roughly half of the people who enter the industry leave after about <span class="posthilit">a</span> year.<br /><br /><span class="posthilit">For</span> me, game dev was an okay fit. I don't actually get <em>too</em> stressed by the particular problems involved, but I have become quite aware that I am unusual in that regard.<br /><br />If <span class="posthilit">you</span> want to make <span class="posthilit">a</span> game, indie dev has never been easier than it is now, and can be <span class="posthilit">a</span> great hobby. If <span class="posthilit">you</span> want to <span class="posthilit">do</span> it as <span class="posthilit">a</span> <span class="posthilit">living</span>, though, my honest opinion is that very few people are actually cut out <span class="posthilit">for</span> it, and the rest would be very unhappy in the games industry.<br /><br />Examples of factors that drive people out of the industry:<br />- Constant compromise: there is never enough time/money/skill to <span class="posthilit">do</span> <span class="posthilit">what</span> <span class="posthilit">you</span> want to <span class="posthilit">do</span>.<br />- Lack of control: <span class="posthilit">you</span> will be told to <span class="posthilit">do</span> things the wrong way sometimes (often), and <span class="posthilit">you</span> won't have the authority to fight it.<br />- Skilled work, like programming, is often better paid outside the industry.<br />- Half of game projects will be cancelled before release, <span class="posthilit">you</span>'re going to spend years of your life on failures.<br />- Constant layoffs. This is an endemic part of the industry, <span class="posthilit">for</span> various reasons.<br />- Long hours.<br />- Programming, especially game programming, is very volatile and unpredictable because of its complexity (unexpected bugs, etc.), so is very hard to schedule/estimate. This leads to <span class="posthilit">a</span> large host of problems that affect everyone in the company.
