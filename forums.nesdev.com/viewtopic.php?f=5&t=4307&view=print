I'm thinking of download a 3.3 gig 10 day trial and then after that you must purchase it, but I am not sure if that way I can go without the CD which is a must for me really. Does a purchase copy provide you with nothing more than a CD key to enter or what?

<br />What about copy/pasting the text in an editor that features fixed font ?
<br />
<br />Also why on the earth would you like to play WOW ?
<br />Personally I'm quite against wow because I had a lot of friends who were fans of Final Fantasy like me but they moved to wow and have no life any more nor they do remember anything about FF, even consindering how much better the FF series is (was to be more exact).

<br />
<br />Well, then you have people like me who are completely shaped and morally altered by Final Fantasy, and yet, still are huge fans of WoW. After how much FF I've played, there's no way I'd forget anything about it. Well, unless my brain got damaged somehow. But it's true that some people play WoW as their brain leaks out their ear, and they become hopelessly addicted.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I played WoW. I can tell you that you do not need the CD to play. Because the game has no use unless you pay for an account, there is no copy protection. Similarly to you, I downloaded the trial, then bought it later. You just put in the CD key if I recall when you make your account sign up for a subscription. I forget the details but I do know that the CD is basically just to ease the install process/reduce what you need to download. This may not be the case with Burning Crusade the expansion, but your original question should have the same answer, no you don't need a CD inserted.
