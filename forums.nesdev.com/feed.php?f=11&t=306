Then Bregalad (Quickbeam/Hasty) is an accurate name for you, as frankly the notion of a month-old thread seeming too old to reopen is (to me) absurd. I participate in forums where threads over a year old are reopened all the time. In fact, to me a year of time isn't all that long, but I'm guessing that I’m probably a great deal older than most of the community here. Heck, often I don't even have the time to read the threads on a forum for over a month or more, while I work on various projects, as was the case last month.<br /><br />As for whether or not you feel that I'll 'grow into this', I've been posting on BBSes, Usenet and forums for over 25 years, so it's not like I’m new at this, but I do have a completely different relativistic sense of time from you, seemingly. If you feel that re-opening a month old thread is digging, then just ignore my posts in those threads and don’t read anything older than one month, as it'll save you from wasting your time. <br /><br />As to reopening a five-year-old thread, yes, I'd agree that it was ancient, but it is still one of the most recent threads on the FCdev board, which makes it (to me) active. I didn’t even notice the year of the thread until you pointed it out, as it was still on the first (and only) page of this board.<br /><br />Regardless of its age, the information that I added was seemingly unknown by the rest of the community, else I suspect that someone would have mentioned it in the last five years, so I believe that it was informative and relevant to the spirit of this forum. <br /><br />Did anybody else know how to identify a Hong Kong regional (official Nintendo) Famicom at a glance or that Nintendo made PAL FC units for HK? I don’t have a photo of the unit owned by the original poster, and this is why I always link images from my own server, as I know they will remain indefinitely static. I can always take photos of the JP and HK market versions side-by-side, but given that nobody seemingly appreciates the facts that I gave on the subject and instead you made it a case to passive-aggressively tear me a new blower—which I find to be very insulting and childish—I don’t know why I should bother. <br /><br />For the record, the information that I added to this thread is handy for anybody buying a Famicom unit, as if it has the gold nameplate, then it's PAL and you should avoid buying it if you don’t want to modify it for use. I’d say that was pretty informative and relevant to the original post in this thread. Can you argue that? How many other folks knew that off the top of their heads?<br /><br />I joined NesDev for the exchange of factual information and to both assist its members and potentially gain the aid of others in my own endeavors. I’ve been a tech and systems engineer for nearly 30-years, and I know a great deal about vintage video game and computer systems. I don't ask a lot in return for what I do, but I’m not a doormat, and if you have a problem with me, you should send me a PM rather than making an off-topic rant in a thread. Somehow, I think there is probably a forum rule about that.<br /><br />It really comes down to the same simple point: if you don’t want to read reopened threads that are over a certain age, then don’t read them. I didn’t force you to do so and you can easily identify the longevity of a thread if you care about that sort of thing.<br /><br />-Xious<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">Bregalad wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"><br /><div class="quotetitle">tepples wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">"It is always better to post in an existing thread than to start a new one."<br /></div><br />Again, if it was always better, nobody should ever make new thread and the whole board should be compacted in a single thread.

I do not. I read and respond only to threads that in some way interest me, or those for which I have a reasonable store of knowledge, and that is why you will see almost all of my responses in the HWDev section. If you don’t want to read replies to 5-year old posts, then just ignore them.

The auction has expired, so I can’t see the photos. Can you please post them here?<br /><br />Nintendo also made a version of the Famicom for the Hong Kong market that was PAL. I believe the nameplate is coloured differently (red text on brass rather than gold text on metallic red) on the PAL HK release. The Nippon release has a red nameplate with gold text on it, so if your nameplate's colour scheme is inverted, you have the HK version. <br /><br />I've seen clones that are identical on the outside to the Famicom, but never PAL versions. <br /><br />If it is a PAL version, you can always do an A/V mod to use it on an NTSC monitor/TV.<br /><br />-Xious<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=4070">Xious</a> — Fri Mar 05, 2010 9:07 am</p><hr />

The so-called Taiwan version pictured in the UK auction must be a clone, because no true Famicom has turbo buttons or comes with A/V cables and all true Famicoms come with a microphone in the second controller.  (Thats almost always the case for clones, they feel the need to offer something better than the real thing besides price.)  Only a Famicom A/V comes with A/V cables, and always Nintendo's multi-out variety and lacks a micrphone.    Still, it looks very close to the real McCoy.  I wonder if these early Famiclones work as well as the real thing, because the later ones do not. <br /><br />Taiwan always was particularly lawless when it came to intellectual property laws, so Nintendo would make no money by introducing the real Famicom and games when pirate outfits could undercut it dramatically.<br /><br />It is possible that the system could be pirated, although as Quietust points out the Kanji logo for Nintendo is properly done but meaningless outside of Japan.  Unfortunately, the tell-tale signs (turbo buttons) are not visible in the picture.  The cartridge is surely pirated.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=58">Great Hierophant</a> — Sat May 07, 2005 12:12 pm</p><hr />

&gt;  a model on eBay being described as a Taiwan model of the Famicom looks like this:<br /><br />Taiwan version is just a hoax.

Hmm, the auction described it as being NTSC, and I wouldn't pay for a PAL Famicom either. I'm now thinking about if it could be a Famicom from Taiwan, where they use NTSC, but this is just pure speculation on my part.  Also, a model on eBay being described as a Taiwan model of the Famicom looks like this:<br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://cgi.ebay.co.uk/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&amp;category=3617&amp;item=8187902540&amp;rd=1">http://cgi.ebay.co.uk/ws/eBayISAPI.dll? ... 02540&amp;rd=1</a><!-- m --><br /><br />And on this one, the "Family Computer" logo seems to have been replaced with Kanji(?) characters altogether. Also, the box on this one seems to lack any Nintendo logo at all, making the question of separating originals from clones even harder. Is there no expert on these matters present here? :)<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=106">Bananmos</a> — Fri May 06, 2005 3:48 am</p><hr />

If those are not true Nintendo-made Famicoms, then they are the closest I have ever seen to the real McCoy.  I think they are real.  The one with the Chinese lettering on the stripe may be a PAL Famicom that was released in Hong Kong.  Hong Kong was very odd that they saw an official release of both the NES and the Famicom (perhaps a general Asian version), but I have seen no evidence of specific Famicom games for Hong Kong Famicom.    <br />The one without any lettering at all may be a pirate or a very early Famicom (1983), made before the better known stripe design.  The most common Famicoms have the Nintendo name inbetween the line to the right side of "Family Computer."  Other Famicoms, probably manufactured later, also have the "FF" symbolon the left side of "Family Computer."<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=58">Great Hierophant</a> — Thu May 05, 2005 3:48 pm</p><hr />
