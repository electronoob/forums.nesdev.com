		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I'd echo what 43110 said about the two tools.  Tepples' editor is powerful and feature packed, and has a good manual to explain how to use it all.  But frankly many of those features I don't personally want to always run with a NES tool.  I'm sure if I devoted an hour or two to play around with Tepples' editor I would get the hang of it and have more appreciation for the features.  But as it is right now it's hard to gain the motivation to learn it and test it out.  That's where NESpix shines, the beauty and simplicity of the screen shots yanked at my nesdev heartstrings and I couldn't help but spend 5min of my lunch hour to go try it out.<br /><br />The annoyance I find in drawing on the NES is mainly with pattern table creation.  I don't care how accurate coloring/filters claim to be, you can't come close to the NES on a CRT.  While I'm drawing pixels on a zoomed scale, I want to immediately see those pixels rendered on the normal scale.  Even better, I want to see the tile I'm editing  next to multiple other tiles at the same time, and being able to edit 4 tiles at a time is a beauty.  I currently use NESST for all my NES drawing needs.  The biggest annoyance I have with it is during PT editing, but it's great for NT/AT generation after the PT's have been created.<br /><br />To top it off the user friendliness is spectacular.  I think I could fairly easily teach my 6yr old daughter who's a wiz with the mario paint tile editor, to draw on the NES using this tool.  All other NES drawing tools I'm aware of would be too complex.<br /><br />So while NESpix is limited, it does the one thing I want to do on the NES with near perfection.<br /><br />I'm thinking it would be awesome to be able to include NESpix and Tepples' editor on the next action53 release.  The best way to overcome the lack of WRAM on the action53 cart would be to modify our  mapper to support mapping the 'user flash' we talked about for the serial bootloader cable to the $6000-7FFF slot.  The pattern table data could then be dumped with the serial bootloader and/or a cartridge dumper which supports our multi-mapper.  Curious what you guys think about it's inclusion with Action53 volume2.<br /><br />miau, would you be willing to share your source code?  I'm sure I could modify the save routine to support flash writes instead of regular sram writes that are being done now.

Including stuff like this and the serial bootloader could coax people into getting their feet wet with NES development. Which, with your suggestion about using Flash, immediately brings forth another idea: the graphics editor(s) could be used to edit graphics in some small game that is included in the cartridge.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />At least for my editor, SRAM would be needed because that's where the working copy of the picture is stored and modified. And the problem with just saving and restoring $6000-$7FFF is one of allocating slots to each game. It would be better as a separate project with adequate development and testing time.

What does it allow you to do? And/or, if you would be willing to explain the source with a bit more detail I would appreciate it. I have something I think is similar and would like to compare.
