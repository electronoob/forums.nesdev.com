<br />
<br />The lua folder is the lua package -- it builds into NESICIDE.  Lua code for NESICIDE is coming and will be in the form of plugins in the plugins folder.

<br />mattmatteh: If you have gentoo I'd love to have you pop over onto our IRC channel and have you give us some gentoo love <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />
<br />
<br />Lua is a local copy that gets built into the app directly. I do not want the app to link or build against a system copy of lua for now as I'm paranoid about the changes between minor versions.
<br />
<br />As far as make install, qmake doesn't have any native install mechinism. Unlike autotools, qmake can't assume a unix-like environment.

The XP and Vista/7 instructions are exactly the same so it doesn't matter which one you try:<br /><a href="http://wiki.nesicide.com/doku.php?id=developer_documentation" class="postlink">http://wiki.nesicide.com/doku.php?id=developer_documentation</a><br /><br />Please let me know if you run into any problems, or even if you were successful <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /></div>
<br />
<br />Yeah, I know no one has posted since July but <img src="./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" />  .  I am having significant issue building NESICIDE.  I followed the instructions on the wiki, yet I am recieving 89 errors, coupled with 58 warnings.  Most of the errors are missing headers and "out of scope" errors.  I also have several syntax errors, though they are probably from missing headers resulting in "undeclared" variables.
<br />
<br />Some of the header files missing include emulator_core.h , ctracer.h , cbreakpointdata.h , and cregisterdata.h.  This looks like I missed a download package or something.  Do you see anything here?  Thanks.
<br />
<br />EDIT:
<br />
<br />woops, I forgot to tell you I am building on the Vista platform.

<br />
<br />Sorry, the wiki is woefully outdated.  I updated it [at least the Vista page, anyway].  The errors you're getting seem like they're related to the wiki not mentioning that you also need to get the libnesicide2-emulator git repository.  The emulator core has been separated into a DLL.

<br />
<br />Qt does rock!  But, I've been putting off figuring out how to do things like custom controls like I did in the MFC version of the tool.
