Health power ups vanish as soon as soon as they hit the ground.<br />Shooting certain objects in the CP stage takes you to the password screen.<br />This happens in the v1.0 ROM, not the v1.1 ROM.

Yes, test on hardware if you can. Otherwise, make sure you initialize absolutely every register and memory device (just to be safe, avoid the randomness of real hardware on power-on), and make sure it works in bsnes. If it works on hardware but not any emulator, don't care to the emulator.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=375">byuu</a> — Fri Sep 17, 2010 10:07 am</p><hr />

As long as it works on all revisions of the Super NES, it's fine. Any difference between the Super NES and an emulator is either a defect in the emulator (for emulators intended to work on current desktop PCs) or a tradeoff (for emulators intended to work on handheld or set-top devices). If you can arrange the garbage to spell "Use a real SNES" in the snesticle-class emulators, that might help drive the point home.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=9">tepples</a> — Fri Sep 17, 2010 7:16 am</p><hr />

The big unspoken fact is that ZSNES is probably less accurate to the SNES than NESticle is to the NES. You don't notice as much because the SNES being faster, games are less sensitive to timing.<br /><br />Think about system requirements:<br />NESticle -&gt; 100MHz (written in x86 ASM too)<br />ZSNES -&gt; 166MHz<br />Nestopia -&gt; 800MHz<br />Nintendulator -&gt; 1,500MHz<br /><br />There's something seriously not right when a system that has five processors instead of two, all clocked faster, on a substantially more complex system, results in emulators that are far faster than their quintessential NES counterparts.<br /><br />I basically got it wrong. I believed people flocked to Nestopia because it was so much more accurate. But it was a combination of many things. 800MHz is well within 90% of peoples' hardware ranges, Nesticle was dying off and discontinued, was closed source, was DOS only and was no longer even producing sound. People had to switch, and they went to the best option of the time.<br /><br />With ZSNES being the #1 choice these days, it has caused people to believe that its system requirements are what an SNES emulator "should" require. And don't get me wrong, for what it does it's amazing, and it certainly has its place. But for any kind of dev work, forget it.<br /><br />And just suggesting that anything was like NESticle has become something of a pejorative in the emulation community.<br /><br />But if you've run any kind of code on it, you know. Here's some fun facts if you don't:<br /><br />There is no S-SMP opcode timing. All opcodes consume "a clock". The 12-cycle DIV YA,X takes the same amount of time as the 2-cycle NOP. This was done to avoid a single indirect memory access penalty.<br /><br />The S-CPU does not support FastROM memory access. When you turn it on, it simply uses a different lookup table that takes one less cycle for every opcode, even if that opcode never accesses any FastROM regions, or even if it accesses it multiple times (eg 16-bit RMW).<br /><br />S-CPU open bus is faked. It returns address&gt;&gt;8 because that is faster than storing the MDR after each successful read. Works great on lda $004212, not so great on lda [$00]. Enjoy MMX v1.0 Chill Penguin stage.<br /><br />DMA does not consume any CPU time.DRAM refresh is non-existent. Different memory access speeds do not exist. The S-PPU field bit was not implemented until v1.51, which would deadlock all of my timing tests.<br /><br />The S-CPU runs 40% faster than a real CPU, because you're more likely to break a game by running too slow than by running too fast.<br /><br />Unlike NESticle, where people hacked NES ROMs to run in it, the hacks are stored internally. Even when you think you've found them all, you miss the "hidden" ones, like for Uniracers. It knowingly behaves wrong on OAM address reset to get the game to have the right value to work, and this affects every game instead of just one.<br /><br />The S-DSP never writes to the echo buffer at all, it keeps its own internal one.<br /><br />And it wouldn't be a "byuu post" if I didn't bring up that I first reported the VRAM write during active display bug in 1998. It's a one-line fix.<br /><br />I'm also somewhat disappointed with the direction of Snes9X v1.52. They went with blargg's accurate DSP core, but they paired it with opcode-based CPU and SMP cores, largely negating its merit (try Earthworm Jim 2.) A much better accuracy to performance tradeoff would have been a cycle CPU core with blargg's fast DSP or anomie's DSP. 9X is now "only" ~80% faster than bsnes, but not much more accurate than when it used to barely compete with ZSNES on speed.<br /><br />And of course, my emulator is slow as a snail and the GUI+drivers are buggy as all hell. Thanks to Qt there's a new mystery bug with every build.<br /><br />We really, really, really need some new blood.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=375">byuu</a> — Fri Sep 17, 2010 1:40 am</p><hr />

I wouldn't say v068 official is entirely 1.6GHz Atom ready. Some of the crazier PPU-heavy games can stall it a bit.<br /><br />The next release will be an extra ~10% faster, and if you combine that with the MSI Wind turbo function (1.91GHz dynamic overclock), 60fps should be doable in just about any non-SA1/SFX game.<br /><br />And no problem. It's sort of been my goal all along. Rather than go top-down (start with fast code, then fix bugs), I went bottom-up (start with correct code, then make it faster.) Still a work in progress, so hopefully I can keep making it faster.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=375">byuu</a> — Thu Sep 16, 2010 9:50 pm</p><hr />

Snes9X and ZSNES have poor support for NMI and IRQ. Try F-1 Grand Prix and Sink or Swim. Whereas I spent two weeks researching an edge case where if an IRQ triggers on the edge of a two-cycle opcode with an I/O cycle, it gets converted to a bus read without PC increment.

But I used an SNES clone for initial and periodic testing, which seemed to be fairly close to the actual hardware (except for a couple oddities with the controller ports).  On that, nothing would work right until I had initialized probably every single register in the system.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=10">Memblers</a> — Thu Sep 16, 2010 3:32 pm</p><hr />

And can its capture be synchronized to the emulator's output?<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"><br />Or run your program on a real SNES that you hook up to a video capture device (which is what I do if I want to grab a video of something I've written).<br /></div><br />Super NES video with the interlace bit turned off is a non-standard 240p signal, and both video capture devices that I own have had a problem with it. One (an Aiptek camcorder with a composite input) works with 480i video from my Wii, but with 240p video, it stops recording after five seconds, throws an error message, and ends up with a horribly out-of-sync clip. The other (a Philips DVD recorder) works with NES video but for some reason rapidly flickers between color and black-and-white when trying to receive Super NES video. Good luck finding an online electronics store whose sales staff know whether or not the devices that the store sells are compatible with the non-standard video output of any given pre-Dreamcast console.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"><br />If you write a game that works on a real SNES but not e.g. in Snes9x, then Snes9x should be fixed<br /></div><br />In theory, I agree. In practice, good luck getting the maintainers of Snes9x to attend to your test case collection before your video is due. It's been eight months since the most recent version of Snes9x. But it's worth a shot; I made a whole bunch of test cases for VisualBoyAdvance while trying to get TOD working on GBA.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=9">tepples</a> — Thu Sep 16, 2010 2:21 pm</p><hr />
