The bicompatible game did the following to pay lip service to using the SGX's extra power:<br /><br /><img src="http://www.chrismcovell.com/images/Darius_Plus_Layers.jpg" alt="Image" />

When it has to fill the entire screen, the flickering looks weird (since a full screen worth of pixels isn't enough to fill the whole screen because of scrolling). YT videos don't run at 60fps though, so it might look better on the actual console.

So many available palettes on that system, yet everything looks so monochromatic. Another thing that caught my attention is how objects have very few animation frames. This console could do so much better!

Darius Plus, which was released later, was unfortunately a Hucard, so those additional bosses had to be cut.

Though it makes me wonder just how much more they might have accomplished if the SuperGrafx had been included in the DUO hardware. Ofcourse it would have been too costly but if it hadn't been, that would have been a neat system. It would have been able to display more sprites than any of its competitors except I suppose NeoGeo. Plus the SuperGrafx had extra RAM which combined with the Super CD card's RAM could have helped a bit more before the Arcade CD card came along.

The chip that mixes the two outputs of the video controllers can set priority to the sprite layers in relation to the BG layers (but cannot change the BG layer priorities; they're fixed). I have a sprite on VDC1 (the top video layer) that is &quot;low priority&quot;. That means it will be drawn behind all BG pixels of VDC1, but show out in the transparent pixels of the BG layer (like any other system of that era). VDC0 has the same sprite in the exact same position underneath the sprite in VDC1, but with a different palette associated to it. The VDP (priority controller) is setup in a configuration (1 of 4 settings) so that the sprites are like so: 'spr0,bg0,'spr1,bg1,*spr0,*sp1. ' = low priority, *= high priority. VDC1 sprites always have a higher priority than VDC0 sprites. But when VDC1 low priority sprite passes in front of VDC1 BG, it disappears (on a pixel basis) allowing VDC0 sprite to show underneath. Given that the SGX has the inherent number of supalettes of the PCE (32 subpalettes), it's pretty easy to create alternate colored palettes for transparency effects like that without running short of subpalettes.

Which wins out in total sprite pixels per scanline? Or is it a draw?</div><br /><br /> You must be thinking sprite pixel scanline limit; 272 sprite pixels or 34 8-pixel-wide cells or 32 sprites (total) for the SNES per scanline and 512 pixels or 32 16-pixel-wide cells or 32 sprites (total) per scanline for the SGX. Of course, on the PCE and SGX that's per *VDC scanline* and not NTSC scanline. You can setup the VDC to draw two or more scanlines per NTSC scanline, but you'll get a gap between them (the width of hblank since no pixels will be sent to the encoder except color #256; sprite transparency color). The PC-Engine is 256 pixels or 16 16-pixel-wide cells per scanline. Which ever comes first. It doesn't increase with the resolution change either, since the internal fetch/hold buffer isn't larger than that. Which is why most PCE games stick with the 5.37mhz dot clock over the 7.16mhz and 10.74mhz dot clock resolutions. So that's another advantage the SGX has over the PCE. The higher resolutions become more useful in relation to sprites and scanline limits.
