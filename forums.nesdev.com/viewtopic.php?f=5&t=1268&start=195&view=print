Turns out one minor issue with the MM2 GBS was that 3(0x03) bytes of trailing 00s were trimmed from the file. Why the hell they were removed is beyond me, but by adding them back in, the first note of several songs now play. Who knows what else was affected by this tiny fraction of missing data. I did a little extra to help reduce data difference for the debugging, but the 3 null bytes had the only noticed effect. Definately not my first guess about the issue or the solution.<br /><br />It may play a little better, but you can't overcome some issues if the emulator doesn't play things right to start with.<br /><br />It's actually kind of nasty for a Mono GBS. It kept referencing the RST table for sound data, which doubled as coding.</div>

<br />Actually the problem is that the notes are held on certain channels. I know I probably sound annoying at this point. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_cool.gif" alt="8)" title="Cool" /> It may hae Scott Worley's first .gbs

<br />
<br />I have rips that could fall under either category. Why do you think I ripped Frommer's Travel Guide? It's because I have the cart, and wanted a GBS for the collection. Why eventually do a GG rip? It's because I enjoyed the Game Genie quite a bit, regardless of the quality of the sound. That big list Knurek posted near the start of the topic has been whittled down to something like 5 games. If I recall correctly, that's just from a favorites folder.
<br />
<br />As for MM2, it needed an overhaul anyways to get it working more accurately. The tones I hear in NEZPlug++ sound equivalent to the GB Conversion/Game. If you're referencing some other issue, I don't know which. I make it play the same from BGB in the game and as a .GB converted GBS if I can, because that usually means any edit to the underlying mechanics of sound production will usually affect both the game and the .GB the same way.

<br />Ugetab, is it possible at all or even for someone like me to edit the Pokemon Crystal battle tracks making different channels pan the way I like?  Hex editing or something?
<br />
<br />I don't understand how anyone could dislike the first two generations of Pokemon games' charming music.  You can't deny the overall joy conveyed by the high and crystal clear instruments of the tracks.  If you don't like joyful, happy, hopeful music, then something is wrong with you.  Go listen to death metal. &lt;/rant&gt;

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />As a GBS/NSF/SPC ripper, I can make my own stuff. For other formats, I can't do a thing, so I don't mind doing certain rips just because someone wants it for their collection. People have filled unspoken PSF requests(Vandal Hearts 2), and many have worked on the VGM Genesis rips at length(which I grabbed all of), and someone else extracted the ADXs from the PS2 Tales of Symphonia that I'm listening to now. I can't download or get access to most of these games, and I can't write the software that plays them, but what I can do is a fair amount of rips for somewhat older systems, or at least help make it happen(I'm willing to make music changing codes for SNES games to help someone rip a complete set).
<br />
<br />People are free to request even a fairly significant list of games, as long as they're not expecting immediate results. I took it upon myself to go through a list of Gamefaqs mono Gameboy RPGs just because RPGs can have decent music. It's not done, but it's started. It would be hypocritical to request something(even only occasionally), and not provide some of what I can rip on request.

I mean, I'm all about NESdev, but I'm not gonna jump out of buildings because of it. Though attributes still make me want to kill myself  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_lol.gif" alt=":lol:" title="Laughing" />.
<br />
<br />It's funny that you should say people who lack hope listen to Death Metal. My brother could go on for hours with his rotten morals speech about how hope is just waiting to be let down, and he listens to nothing BUT Death Metal. But yeah, you don't have to be like that in order to like it. I like SOME Death Metal, but usually, it's like Coffee; I like it sweet, and not bitter. So usually I like melodic music that's not unpleasant, like Death Metal.

As long as the discussion is productive, who cares?  It's not like little tangents here and there are getting in the way of the thread's topic.  If you have something to say regarding a "GBS Request," say it!  Everyone has equal power to mold the discussion around the information they know/want to discuss.
