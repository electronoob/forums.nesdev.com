<br />8kB mapper 0 = NROM games can be handled just fine right now by having the file on your disk contain the 8kB repeated once. There is no need for another mapper.

<br />Nononono.... you are not getting my point. Whether it's a no-connection or whatever electrical measures it takes, the mirroring is decided by how the catridge is set-up, not by the system, itself. Therefore, you must say that any kind of mirroring does belong to the mapper information. (Or the mapper related information, if this makes you happier)
<br />
<br />If you have a problem with me saying "extra wiring", alright... I'll change the term to "extra wirework". You are still not satisfied.. then to "electrical measure", or even to "hardwarewise catridge setup" 
<br />This is not important at all. 
<br />
<br />The thing is IMO that  the mirroring is a part of mapper, and the mappers should be assigned on a practical bases, not by a philosophical bases. The INES header system has already made a hugh limitation on using 8kb roms, so creating a new mapper for them is, I am saying, the MOST PRACTICAL SOLUTION.
<br />
<br />Hope, you are satisfied and we can all go home, now. peace.

Adding a new mapper number for NROM-128 in this most obvious 8 KiB configuration would require a rewrite of all iNES ROM image loaders because the header provides no way to specify any PRG size smaller than 16384 bytes.

<br />
<br />I'm not sure that I understand you right, but the No-Intro team crapped the last 8192 byte of the overdumped Galaxian rom from the Good set and renounced it as a valid rom image.  So now we have two type of Galaxian rom images one with 8kb PRG-ed rom image without any recessive data, and 16kb PRG-ed overdumped rom image including 8kb recessive mirror. The second one (16kb one from the Good set) works fine with all the emulator in mapper 0, but the first one(from the No-intro set) won't work because the emulators can't tell that the rom needs an excessive mirrioring.
<br />
<br />If an emulator author wants to incorporate these 8kb rom images to mapper 0 under the INES header system, he will have to probably re-write mapper 0 to check the actual size of rom image and guess whether the 8kb mirroring is needed or not.  But we all know that only one rom image (Galaxian) is needing this overhead for the mapper 0, which I think is a kind of waste. On the other hand, if we assign a new mapper number for the 8kb roms, the mapper loader for it can just load the 8bk PRG section to 8000h ~ ffffh four times and we can call it a day.  We can also assing the overdumped Galaxian to mapper 0, the 8kb-dumped Galaxian to the new mapper number, and both will work happily in emulators, all the time. 
<br />
<br />I don't know but this really looks more practical approach to me, at least.

<br />
<br />There have been trials, but the rom listers hate UNIF header as it is very undocumented and under-maintained.  Unless more effort is put for the UNIF project by someone, I consider it pretty much a dead project. suppose.

<br />
<br />Why are you calling it lame and waste?
<br />
<br />The iNES header curruntly supports 256 maximum mappers and if we use the unused lower nibble of 7th bit of iNES header, we can make this 8 * 256 = 2048 possible mappers. Just using one out of 2048 won't be that waste, especially considering that the new types of NES rom won't be on production officially.
<br />
<br />And also,  writing a new mapper for 8kB PRG-ed roms would be a lot more efficient programming-wisely than re-writing mapper 0, which will require to calculate the actiual PRG size using the rom image's length.
<br />
<br />If you are really going to call it lame, I ask you, at least, the reason for it.

<br />Well, "waste" is relative. I think it's a waste, you don't, there's no arguing there.
<br />
<br />I think it's lame, among other reasons, because it makes the meaning of the PRG-ROM size byte less correct. What if an emulator uses the number of banks to load the data from the file before looking at the mapper number? Emulators would have to check for this particular mapper and override the size of the PRG-ROM. I don't know if other mappers do that, but it's a poor solution.
<br />
<br />It's also lame because you are trying to fix something that isn't even a real problem to begin with (the game runs, what's the big deal?). There are several other problems with the iNES header that are far worse than this.
<br />
<br />P.S: I never meant to be part of this discussion, I just stepped in because I was tired of it. I don't plan on participating any longer unless something changes (people start using different arguments).

What if an emulator uses the number of banks to load the data from the file before looking at the mapper number? <br /></div><br />I have two answers for your comment.<br /><br />1) If the emulator uses the number of banks to load the data from the file before looking at the mapper number, 8kb PRG will never work on this emulator, because in iNes header there is no way to tell the size of bank. Only the emulators, that can check the mapper info and adjust mirror according to it, will be able to run it. This means: you get no working emulator, if you don't use a new mapper, but you will get some, if you USE the new mapper. <br /><br />2) Actually there is a way around this, though . If you use bank size of 1 for the 8kb rom, then the emulator will load 8kb PRG + the first 8kb portion of CHR rom to the PRG buffer. Then, you load CHR based on the bank information and check for the EOF has been reached presumptually.<br />If so, you can check for the mapper number and reload it with the proper mirroring, and it will work fine.<br /><br />Choose whatever solution you like, but in (1), you will get at least some emulators be able to run the rom only if you use a new mapper, while none if you don't. And in (2) these emulators will have no problem with the new mappered Galaxian. So both answer will beat you argument. <br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">tokumaru wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">It's also lame because you are trying to fix something that isn't even a real problem to begin with (the game runs, what's the big deal?).

<br />
<br />The game is not running on the major NES emulator like Nestopia and fceux under iNes header, so it is a problem. 
<br />
<br />You may wanna say just use UNIF. But,  None of the major set you will encounter over the net will be using it. And I am pretty sure that nobody wants to waste their time to fix 3000+ iNES headered NES roms into UNIF headered ones. So it is not practical.
<br />
<br />Futhermore, assigning a new iNes mapper number doesn't have any effect on the board type declaration of UNIF header. If you don't like iNes header in the first place, why do you mind whether iNes mappers are being wasted or not? This will at least give iNes header users better compatibility.

<br />I mind whether iNES mappers are wasted because we need to save the mappers for boards used by actual games that we haven't dumped yet, such as new HKO games and new pirate multis.

<br />Again the total number of iNes mappers can be increased up to 2048 mappers if we are going to use the lower nibble of 7th byte of iNES header. This will be more than plenty for the all the new dumps that you can imagine of,  plus all the pokemon that you can catch.

But even if there were four million possible mappers, there would still be a lot of resistance among emulator authors to making the bank size which currently "is defaulted to 16384 by the iNes author" depend on the mapper number, given that the status quo works for every commercial game on Famicom and NES save Galaxian. I'd like to see what kevtris, the principal author of the 2.0 revision, thinks of making PRG page size depend on the mapper number.

Open a wiki project, persuade emu authors and rom dumpers to joint the project, and make it going. I would say persuading Membler to open UNIF wiki project as a side project of nesdev is a good place to start. But until then, let's not talk about how a non-exisitng project can solve our problem.

<br />I don't know who's kevtris, but the actual people that I would like to hear about this matters are the authors of Nestopia and FCEUX.  I think it is these two, who is curruntly leading the NES emulation scene. It will be likely that their solution, no matter what they do, will be a law.
