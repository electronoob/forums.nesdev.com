		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />You should probably be using an initialization routine to set initial values for all the registers as well as zero out the memory. This way you're starting with a known state. bsnes-plus is likely simulating the real hardware behavior of RAM effectively being filled with random values on power on.<br /><br />There's an InitSNES routine floating around that you can use.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />After using bsnes-plus for a couple days, here are my impressions. Compilation was easy compared to higan, though I needed to edit some files to disable pulseaudio and to shrink the cheats.xml file, it's not nice to drop a 3mb file to my home dir without asking me. The tilemap viewer in particular was good. The debugger on the other hand fell short in many ways.<br />- why does it only show instructions after break/step? I expected a continuous view<br />- why does the disassembler show such a small amount of code? I couldn't find any way to increase it<br />- I couldn't figure out how to set breakpoints<br />- the disassembler showed wrong code once, perhaps it took the code as 16-bit when the registers were set to 8-bit (and shown as 8-bit in the debugger window)<br /><br />Finally, I couldn't set right shift to the select key. Any other key was accepted, but not shift for some reason. Maybe a Qt quirk?

I expected a continuous view</div><br />I don't think that'd work that well. Thousands of instructions could be executed every frame. Even if the UI can handle printing them that fast, it would be limited by only being able to refresh at 60 Hz too, so if it shows, say, fifty instructions on screen at once, 99% of the instructions would never even appear on the screen. Furthermore, if the UI's refresh is synced up to the game's, you'd just see the last fifty instructions executed each frame, probably showing something boring like the start of vblank.<br /><br />That all said, I do think there are things that'd be nice to have a continuous view of; I just don't see it working that well for the main debugger log. For instance, something that could keep track of variables in real-time would be nice, rather than having to look at the memory viewer. I've also seen some <a href="https://youtu.be/Q8ph2OVqZeM?t=8m2s" class="postlink">interesting visualizations</a> in Retro Game Mechanics Explained's videos that might be nice to see in real-time.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">calima wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">- I couldn't figure out how to set breakpoints</div><br />Tools -&gt; Breakpoint Editor. &quot;Address Range&quot; is the address range to break on, &quot;R/W/X&quot; is whether you want it to break on a read, write, or execute of those addresses, and &quot;Data&quot; is if you want it to break only when reading/writing a certain value from that address.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />the problem is the SNES is such a big machine that the spaghetti gui style of debugger just gets to unweildy, the NES is pushing it, you end up with 5 windows you have to shuffle to get all the data you need. Factor in the SNES has lots more code, lots more registers, lots more visual state, more palletes, more sprites, a whole spereate sound processor, dma, hdma, ram,vram,sram it just gets too much to make a &quot;button for the thing&quot; debugger. And then you have SA-1, Super FX, DSP, C4 etc etc It gets to the point it needs a monitor so all the commands are in text form, and you can query what you need when you need it. Having some of the other things in a visual format is nice, but I think having a monitor first would be the way to go.

After that I'm going to be focusing on officially migrating the project to Qt 5, as well as continuing and merging Benny's excellent work with the redesigned debugger frontend. (That said, if you have any feedback/suggestions specifically pertaining to that, feel free to post them in the other thread for now)

I actually modified the makefiles on my end to account for the SDK version, and thanks to Macports, I have C++11 support, which was a previous sore spot for compilation on my end.<br /><br />I actually looked it up one day via MacPorts. Qt is utilizing features on newer versions of the Mac operating system that are not supported on my version of Mac... and 5.3.2, which I would have to manually build (or hunt it down somewhere...), is the absolute last version I can use, if I've been doing the correct lookup.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Hopefully it shouldn't be any harder to build that way after officially transitioning to 5.x, at least. I don't really foresee the frontend code (even with the new debug GUI) relying on any extremely recent Qt features considering it's all written for Qt 4 right now anyway; I could certainly try accounting for older OS/library versions in the build process somehow.<br /><br />Might be just as well since AFAIK, options for getting prebuilt 64-bit Qt 5 binaries on Windows are still limited - the only official ones are for MSVC (which isn't an option for this project right now), and the Qt64-NG project stopped at 5.5.0. msys2 lets you install newer versions but I'm not yet sure how those compare in terms of size/dependencies since I haven't tried that option yet.
