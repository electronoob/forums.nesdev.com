		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />EMUya is my first cycle accurate emulator, as in it runs 3 pixels for each CPU clock precisely when it should in the CPU. As well as the PPU is implemented very precisely. However, surprisingly EMUya emulates the most inaccurately in comparison to my other emulators with regards to a couple MMC3 games &amp; the scanline counter irq. <br /><br />Specifically, the title screen on Kick Master wobbles a bit. The fact that the wobbling is different on every frame implies that they don't synchronize with the IRQ at all and that they instruction time it, or it could mean that each IRQ occurs at slightly different times due to the fact that IRQs can only occur in between 2 instructions, and not in the middle of a single instruction. However, the MMC3 IRQ does go off at regular intervals down the screen (haven't checked if its masked yet) - about once every 8 scanlines starting at scanline 4 IIRC. The wobbling goes away if I do the IRQ at dot 240 instead of 260 (but that messes up other games). That implies that there isn't enough time in between the IRQ trigger and when rendering starts for them to be able to execute instructions. Any ideas as to the cause? I was thinking because the difference is 20 dots or so (about the cycles of a IRQ), maybe my IRQ timing is off (however I pass all the tests).

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />So, I'm not 100% sure why, but doing the MMC3 interrupt at dot 270 fixes all problems with every game I've tested thus far. The reason it works is It brings the timing in line with FCEUX. I'm still unsure why FCEUX has this additional delay in there.
