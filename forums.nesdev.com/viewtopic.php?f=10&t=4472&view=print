<br />
<br />Today I went to a flea-market and bought a nes-cart with no label.
<br />I can't get it working and dumped the rom to my PC but still can't get it working.
<br />See my page for details.
<br />
<br />Could you guys take a look at it and try to get it working?
<br />
<br />here's my page:

<br />
<br />As for getting it to work, I'm not sure. Maybe it uses the same mapper as other FDS pirates?

<br />
<br />By the way, Bio Miracle Bokutte Upa uses mapper 42. So does Ai Senshi Nicol. Both FDS to cart hacks. Maybe this one uses it too. I tried to attach such a iNES header to it and see if it would run but it didn't seem to do anything. I also see no battery, so I doubt this conversion supports saving. Or if it does maybe it uses some kind of eeprom or something.

I don't think this is a pirate game, with the official adapter and official looking NROM epoxy board. If you really dumped this with a programmer, why isn't the file size 2^n? You dumped both PRG and CHR? How did you dump &gt;32KiB/&gt;8KiB of ROM without bankswitching? Even if you overdumped ROMs and added on a header it doesn't add up to your file size.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />The first 8K is the FDS BIOS. This is very unusual. The other two FDS hacks I've seen have the FDS BIOS at the end of the ROM. Also, starting around $4010 is basically an FDS Disk file. It's different than a *.FDS file we have now though as it has two extra 00s for the CRC, though no gaps. 
<br />
<br />You should really try to get the cartridge to work on real hardware though. It's strange that it wouldn't work at all. Maybe you need to clean the contacts on the cartridge and use a NES system with a good connector.
<br />
<br />Anyway, this dump you have consists of a slightly modified FDS BIOS, followed by the slightly different dump of Kid Icarus for FDS. There are few enough changes to the BIOS that it shouldn't be too hard to figure out what is going on.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />The FDS Bios has a few minor changes like skipping Disk SET checks (or making sure they always pass) and Drive Ready Checks. Also there looked to be some small controller related change. But other than those 3 or so changes, the BIOS is the same. So the mapper in that cartridge is doing alot of the job of reproducing the operation of the FDS. I think it's not a mapper in the iNES collection yet. 
<br />
<br />With minimal changes to the BIOS the software operation of the game is much the same assuming it works at all. So this mapper probably has 32K of RAM at $6000 to $DFFF, the first 8k of the ROM dump you have goes at $E000 to $FFFF. It has 8K of CHR-RAM. And all the registers work similar to the FDS. You could probably emulate this thing, but you won't likely be reproducing it.
<br />
<br />If you can, you should try dumping the PRG again to be sure you have the contents of the chip correct.
<br />
<br />Edit: In addition to the CRCs being present for each block, there are 22 Bytes (0x16 bytes) of zeroes between Side A and Side B in the FDS file that are not present in the Dump.bin file.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I finished checking the FDS inside the Dump.bin against the "alternate" *.FDS file known as Hikari Shinwa - Palutena no Kagami (1986)(Nintendo)[a].fds
<br />
<br />They match exactly other than the differences I detailed which were that the pirate cartridge has the CRC16 bytes in it (though they are zeroed) and the pirate cartridge cuts off trailing zeroes that are at the end of the disk image.
<br />
<br />One reason the alternate image may be used is because if the pirate doesn't support saving, it already has a new file registered and the other dump does not. However they are registered with the exact same name which is strange.
<br />
<br />My point is though that there is absolutely no differences in the game. It's just supposed to be a pirate cartridge to play FDS games which is nifty if you could change the FDS image on it. Good luck with getting it working.
