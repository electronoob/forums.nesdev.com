I have tried both inl's and danin's fw and programmer respectively, with many many roms and always achieve the same result. I am open to suggestions(about the device, not my brain damage).

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Hello!<br /><br />I pretty much joined today because I ordered some of INL's v1.0 boards last year and recently got another ten v1.1 a week ago. Thanks INL for making these (and that free SNES mold last year too)! This is one of the few threads I follow here at the moment and just wanted to share my thoughts.<br /><br />I have had no issues thus far programming any of the 4MB boards with HiROM/LoRom Slow/Fast or combination thereof. Secret of Mana and Mega Man 7 work great, for example. I've been using INL Retro-Prog with the regular firmware to erase and write (nothing of Danin's), used SNEStuff v1.2.1 to expand these to fit the 4MB board, wrote the ROM, set the slide switch to HiROM and these games seem to work just fine.<br /><br />The only thing I've had issues with so far, which I think I will have resolved today, is getting Demon's Crest to work. I had it written previously to a v1.0 board and thought it was working well, but I didn't check very far into the game and I found that the protection either stopped me at the dragon or Arma (guy who gives you earth power). I've taken the advice of Mottzilla and used UCon64 to crack the ROM, then I expanded it with SNEStuff and tried it in bsnes. It seemed to work great in the emulator whereas the other times I tried it would get stuck or have issues like with real hardware. Crossing my fingers this is the last time I need to reflash that board.<br /><br />I think it's worth reiterating that UCon64 can also deinterleave ROMs for those interested in the Star Ocean decompressed hack. I know Danin works hard to put a lot of features in his program, but I like to stick with what works for me. After I fill the rest of those 4MB boards, I will probably buy a 12MB one to try that out.<br /><br />Aside from that I wanted to ask a couple things that I've seen mentioned in this thread or in Danin's software topic.<br /><br />Danin mentioned Dracula X needed mirroring? Is this true for only his software? I have this on a 4MB flash and it seems to work flawlessly for the first few levels. Mottzilla had his own list of ROMs that needed some protection bypassed. I was looking at Earthbound and a translated Front Mission: Gun Hazard -- what kind of issues do those have? Terranigma is on my list for tonight as well -- I initially had problems getting that board to work because of region restrictions, I'll try UCon64 on it with the -f switch/option. I remember INL had something about hitting reset to bypass stuff?? Don't remember, but I tried and it still wouldn't work (region problem).<br /><br />Probably not the best place for this but it pertains to his dumper/programmer so...in case INL reads this...<br />I'm interested in a couple NES boards as well; particularly the FME-7. It looks like I need to modify my NES to get that full sound? Will the game still have sound (but limited) if I don't add the synth chip option? I assume Gimmick was the target for adding the chip option in the first place and Batman RotJ is the only other one with the FME-7? Also, I see VRC is under the future features/support. Any one else generate enough interest in Akumajo Densetsu just for the sound and extra pretty?<br /><br />Edit: Oh, Mottzilla, whatever your stance is on anything here I'm going to side with you because of the Raziel -- I've been a long fan of LoK. Also, your name reminds me of mozzarella cheese and Mozilla and these are both good things in my mind.<br /><br />Also, if anyone wants me to test a specific ROM or translation, I can do so to help troubleshoot. I won't be using Danin's stuff though, so keep that in mind.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Demon's Crest does have copy protection. I'm certain it has ROM mirroring protection and I think it also has SRAM based protection too. Both of these will trip on INL's board so you need to use the crack. <br /><br />Castlevania Dracula X, I'm not aware of any protection but it might have SRAM based copy protection. As for needing mirroring it depends on how memory is mapped and accessed. The 4MB board might not need any mirroring. However the proper thing to do to ensure no problem is to copy data till it fills up the flash chip. <br /><br />Earthbound has copy protection and may require a crack. However that protection is SRAM based I believe, and the game expects 8KB of SRAM which is what INL's boards are setup to do right now. <br /><br />Front Mission Gun Hazard I'm not aware of any issues, it's always possible SRAM based copy protection might be used. But I'm not aware of it.<br /><br />Terranigma has a regional lockout. I don't think it has any copy protection. There is no hardware bypass for regional lockout unless you modify your console. Using UCON64 you can generally remove any regional lockouts. <br /><br />About FME-7, there are more games than just those two. There are maybe about 8 games that use it. Some are just the Japanese version of a game that used MMC3 in the US. Also, a US prototype of Gimmick exists that doesn't require the expansion audio. It still sounds great. Without the added synth, the Japanese version of Gimmick will have some missing sounds. I'd advise using the US version if you don't get the synth for the Japanese version. <br /><br />I think he has plans to support the VRC series, probably atleast VRC2 / VRC4. It'd be nice to see VRC6 supported, I think a couple games use it. I'm not sure how much interest there is for it.<br /><br />I'm also a fan of the LoK series. Glad you noticed the avatar, I've been using it here for a long time.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Just an update from what I tried:<br /><br />Demon's Crest seems to work without issue after using UCon64. Likewise Earthbound and Terranigma (after fixes), and then some other 4MB LoROM also work just fine. I did have a funny issue with two games that may be unrelated to the boards/programming because I have yet to duplicate them.<br /><br />Two ROMs, The NinjaWarriors and Front Mission: Gun Hazard (a translated version) both cut out on me while playing. When I say this, I don't mean a black screen like a crash or when you don't have a cart inserted. It goes straight to a blue screen/random noise/snowy screen (depending on your TV!).<br /><br />This happened multiple times while playing NinjaWarriors the first day I wrote the ROM happening at random times during play. Sometimes only a minute or two in, other times not until later -- and didn't seem related to gameplay. Gun Hazard did something similar but I let the game sit in the intro/attract mode and it did the same thing after a short time.<br /><br />To describe the issue a bit more -- the SNES power stayed on, but the signal completely cut out. Cycling the power on the console restarted the game like normal, so I know it's not the AV connection.<br /><br />Oddly, this has not happened since. I played NinaWarriors for about a half hour without issues, same for Gun Hazard. It's very possible it could be my SNES I guess, but I haven't once had an issue with it. The timing seems all too coincidental when I try to play a few games I thought I might end up having issues with. They just presented rather strangely. As for now there seems to be no lasting issues, I suppose. Out of sight out of mind.

I have five of the 4MB boards and three of the 12MB ones. All of them don't work for me for specific games, they just cut out at sometimes static places, sometimes random. Tried literally 12 different systems (thanks to my Local Game X Change!) and different set ups like the retrobit power cord, some weird one that has the same plug in, and official cords as well. All fail in the same spot.<br /><br />I'm debating trying on a 3rd party system, but don't want to shell out sixty bucks just to try and make these things work &gt;.&lt;

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />If the signal to the TV cuts out, it's not software related at all. It's related to the lockout chip. The lockout chip losing communication will hold the PPU in Reset State until the console is reset. When the PPU is in its reset state there is no picture output. So if he sees his TV telling him &quot;no signal&quot;, then it's lockout chip related. <br /><br />One thing you could do if you wanted would be to install a switched lockout bypass mod. It would in theory prevent this issue from happening. Oh and when I had this issue, I too thought it was software related as it seemed to like to crash in the same spots. But it's some sort of odd coincidence. The fact is it's the lockout chip.

It could still be power related I suppose, but I doubt it. I get right around 120V in my upstairs office that off a subpanel circuit -- but power could always fluctuate.

Thanks for pointing this out. I haven't had the issues since however *shrug* I've read the lockout chip can sometimes prevent games from working consistently. If I ever do want to mod it, I will probably also cut out the tabs that prevent SFC games from being inserted as well (I don't think I'll ever buy any NTSC SFC games though).<br /><br />I'd also assume that if I got a black, gray, or garbled screen -- it's a game crash due to bad programming, some kind of copy protection, or the like. This was not my case, however.

I was playing trying to complete it start to finish in one long session. I guess I was on the 3rd world when all of a sudden it reset, and then started the blinking reset pattern you get sometimes with a dirty or bad connection. It's worth noting I was playing with my PowerPAK and not an original cartridge. It was really irritating. It had me considering doing a lockout chip mod at the time. I haven't yet though.
