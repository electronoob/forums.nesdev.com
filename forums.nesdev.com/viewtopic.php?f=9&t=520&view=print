		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I just got my Gamebit pieces in the mail, so I've been opening up some carts to clean, and have been checking out the boards to some extent.  I just had a couple quick questions about chips.  
<br />
<br />On the chip itself, how do you count what pin is what?  Do you look at the lettering on the chip and count around like so...?
<br />
<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">16 15&nbsp; 14&nbsp; 13&nbsp; 12&nbsp; 11 10&nbsp; &nbsp;9<br />&nbsp;|&nbsp; |&nbsp; &nbsp;|&nbsp; &nbsp;|&nbsp; |&nbsp; &nbsp; |&nbsp; |&nbsp; &nbsp;|<br />&nbsp;---------------------------<br />|&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; |<br />|&nbsp; &nbsp; LETTERING&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;|<br />|&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; |<br />&nbsp;---------------------------<br />&nbsp;|&nbsp; &nbsp;|&nbsp; |&nbsp; |&nbsp; &nbsp;|&nbsp; |&nbsp; &nbsp;|&nbsp; &nbsp; |<br />&nbsp;1&nbsp; &nbsp;2&nbsp; 3&nbsp; 4&nbsp; &nbsp;5&nbsp; 6&nbsp; &nbsp;7&nbsp; &nbsp; 8</div><br /><br />Forgive my poor quality "chip" up there. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" />  How do you count the pins on PGA's and SIP's as well?  Thanks.[/code]

<br />
<br />SIPs should have a dot or something.  I dunno about PGAs though.

<br />
<br />As for MMC chips, the one in FF says MMC182... how can I tell exactly what MMC chip that is?  I've only heard them referred to as MMC1, MMC2, etc...
<br />
<br />Also, I've noticed that there are traces from some pins that lead to the edge of the board and seem to connect to nothing.  What purpose do these serve?  Are there any good docs on NesDev that I've missed that could help me out with some of this basic electronic stuff?  I've searched Google for other sites on electronics with no leads, so I'm not just asking before searching... I try to be careful of that. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=":wink:" title="Wink" />

<br />I'm not sure what the deal is with those traces that lead off the board.  Seems like they wouldn't be of much use.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I've wondered about traces going off the end of boards too; my guess is that they are for testing the boards. I think the boards are produced as a large super-board and cut into the pieces, so the traces form a large circuit before the board is cut. Sometimes I also find several traces that converge to a hole in the board, probably used to ensure that the hole was cut (if it wasn't, the traces would be connected together and detected during testing).

<br />
<br />I was looking at this doc that claims to have the pinouts for all PRG, CHR, and RAM chips that were used in NES cartridges:
<br />
<br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://nesdev.com/NES%20ROM%20Pinouts.txt">http://nesdev.com/NES%20ROM%20Pinouts.txt</a><!-- m -->
<br />
<br />Is this pretty much complete?  The 28-pin CHR that is on that file says that it's 32kb.  When I load up Duck Hunt in Nintendulator, it says that it uses 8kb of CHR.  Does this mean there was excess space not used, or is there other info on the CHR chip besides graphics?  The answer to this question would also answer a question that's in a heated discussion elsewhere <img src="./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" />

	<tr>
		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />It would use an 8kB ROM (the only usable CHR size without bankswitching).  The pinout is the same as a 32kB one, just that A13 and A14 would be unconnected internally.  I guess it's not in that doc since it's also the same pinout as a 27C64 EPROM (and 27C256 if A13 and A14 are dealt with properly).
