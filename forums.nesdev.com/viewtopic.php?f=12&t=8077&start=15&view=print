But in the end it will just be a neat gimmick since you would have no real games and no real production of the device more than likely.

<br />
<br />But koitsu! Throw in an nVidia 580 GTX, Core i7, SoundBlaster X-Fi, CD-storage, and your SNES will be absolutely ROCKING with that 21KB/frame video transfer rate! (2.48MB/s B-bus-&gt;A-bus, cut in half for sending via A-bus-&gt;PPU, 60fps.) Imagine those beautiful 3D renders in glorious RGB332 / 224x144 @ 30fps.
<br />
<br />(Or route the video through your new device, and treat the SNES like a glorified controller port. Because why not?)

<br />
<br />Nah -- byuu's response was spot on, and is also one of the original reasons why Nintendo scrapped the Play Station (CD drive for the SNES/SFC).  And no that name isn't a typo.

<br />
<br />And that's exactly what I thought you were going to say.  :(
<br />
<br />How do you plan on solving the bus bandwidth issue?  As byuu said, you've got about 21KBytes/sec worth of bandwidth between the PPU and main system memory.
<br />
<br />This is one of the reasons Nintendo originally scrapped their CD drive for the SNES/SFC (which was originally called the Play Station, made by Sony -- no joke).  There wasn't enough bus bandwidth to do full-screen video playback.  I'm not making this up.  It's difficult to find confirmation on the web of this, but <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JKAPMh3K9Y" class="postlink">this is pretty much the best explanation</a>.  Watch the entire video, don't skip around.
<br />
<br />So, good luck with this project... (where's the little emoticon with rolling eyes?  Oh that's some other forum software)
