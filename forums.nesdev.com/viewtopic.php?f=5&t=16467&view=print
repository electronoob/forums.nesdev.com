While some of these names blend in today, i wonder if they might've been reserved for firstborn children in wealthy/mighty clans once.<br /><br />I'm also pretty sure names where given deliberately according to their meaning, rather than because they have a nice ring (we default to this today since the literal meaning is lost on us. Rather, we associate names to other properties like popularity, uniqueness, perception of age, class, ethnicity, etc - some of which has always been true, most likely. But there was also the meaning, which was understood.)

Incidentally, had Superman asked people of Earth to call him Kal while in costume, the people might have accepted it as a short form of Calvin.

As long as he doesn't also look like nintendo's Mario and you treat the fact that his name is Mario naturally (not doing any reference at all), you can do it just fine. Maybe it's natural to me because my name is Mário and I know a few other Marios and I've even known a Luigi. And I'm not even in Italy. Same goes for Zelda. It is a name, and the name of the game is The Legend of Zelda. You're not gonna be sued if you name a character Zelda, as long as you don't connect the characters. The only problem you might face is players trying to find a reason for your naming (breaking the fourth wall).

(You might give two character the same name in one case for the purpose of the confusion it will cause in one circumstances perhaps. Even you might call one character Mario even in a fan game that is also the other Mario and might cause some events in the story due to the confusions. Or a name can be spelled in same way but pronounce differently, or vice-versa. (If you really want the character in the game to be name Zelda, do it anyways, or perhaps reverse it to make Adlez.)<br /><br />If you do not want to use common names (sometimes using common names is useful, and sometimes not, depending on the story and on the character), one way making up the names for the character in a game or fiction can be by cleromancy by random selection, which can come up with &quot;Iuckqlwviv Kjugobe&quot; or &quot;Ziveruskex&quot; (both names I have used in role playing games, although the algorithm in each case is a bit different; the latter algorithm is generally better). Another way could be by an anagram of your own name (or even not anagram, if you don't want anagram), or an anagram of something else. Making the name based on the parts like is mention in the other messages in here can also be done, such as if character is Jewish, Norse, etc, such as if character is the gods' peace, or whatever.<br /><br />And, sometime the character in the computer game might never be given a name because is unnecessary, or sometimes, the program should prompt the player to enter a name (and sometimes give a default if the player leaves it blank; for example, Rogue gives the name &quot;Rodney&quot; by default; ADOM will, if the option is enabled, give a default depending on your character's race/gender).<br /><br /><span style="font-size: 85%; line-height: normal">I also prefer All The Tropes, rather than the TV Tropes. In addition to what tepples mentioned, All The Tropes is using Media Wiki software.</span>

The Japanese do this, most names in Anime are naming them after the thing.. it like calling Romeo, Tragic Lover 1 and Juliet Tragic Lover 2. Some people I know are called Forest and Soft Breeze. <br /><br />The -ova form from Northern Europe to donate they are a daughter.. <br /><br />Iceland - the last name is the fathers name + son/daughter so Christopher Cristopherson is the son of Christopher who is also called Christopher. This is why the Icalendic Phone Book is sorted First name first. <br /><br />For the pure lazy French person - Jennifer lit &quot;my daughter&quot; <br /><br />Then American's and their Jr and III and IV, like really you are so vain your name your kid after you and point out they are the smaller version their whole life.. Seems that when Females' do it they don't add the Jr ( see Gilmore Girls and yes I think it was just meant to be a joke <img src="./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" /> )

Leads to fun situations like signing a legal document affirming all the info is true, yet the suffix on my name is not even offered as a choice.  Having the same name as your parent does lead to some mix-ups when receiving mail, phone calls, etc.  On rare occasions it was useful.  It seems very common instead to name their kid's middle name after themselves, parents, or grandparents.
