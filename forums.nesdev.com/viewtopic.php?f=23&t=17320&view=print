			<span class="gensmall"><b>File comment:</b> 8 to 16</span><br />
		
			<a href="./download/file.php?id=12524&amp;mode=view"><img src="./download/file.php?id=12524&amp;t=1" alt="conversão 8bits para 16 bits.jpg" /></a><br />
			<span class="gensmall">conversão 8bits para 16 bits.jpg [ 145.58 KiB | Viewed 1593 times ]</span>
		

		<br />
	</div><br />My doubt is: would this simply work out of the box or the pirate game was somehow altered to make this possible?<br />I know that would be simple to just use 2 8bit ROMs with the odd/even bytes, but this circuit seems interesting, specially to me who only have a single 8bit ROM to try.<br /><br />Thanks in advance.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Latching the upper and lower bytes on each access and assembling the 16-bit words before they get to the CPU isn't conceptually that different from the N64 RAM being only 9 bits wide and then the RCP memory controller reassembling words before the R4300i sees them. But you'd need a fairly fast ROM for this, and I remember reading somewhere that some early Genesis games couldn't DMA from ROM to VRAM because they were manufactured on slow ROM. Instead, they had to PIO-copy data to VRAM, as if it were a filthy Master System, or copy it to work RAM and then DMA it from there.<br /><br />But I don't see much point, particularly given that the larger 5.0 V EPROMs (27C160 and 27C322) are 16-bit anyway, to the point where people end up using multiplexer circuits to get a 27C322 working with the Super NES's 8-bit data bus. Or were 16-bit EPROMs not made in smaller capacities?

It works but only on real original hardware that has no overclock or TMSS bypass mod done to it. It will not work on any clones except the superclones that use 1:1 copied parts.<br /><br />If you have to use 8bit ROMs use pair of them, it is guaranteed to work and allows you to save money on bulk ordering of the memory chips.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />From my experience pair of 4Mbit chips are only tiny bit more expensive than single 8Mbit chip, you'll be reaching the first discount tier pretty quickly where things even out and pretty quickly after that a point where they are cheaper. Of course it only matters when you start doing tens of carts rather than one or two at a time...<br /><br />The circuit works only because of the slight timing difference between various signals, there's some tens of ns between the edges.
