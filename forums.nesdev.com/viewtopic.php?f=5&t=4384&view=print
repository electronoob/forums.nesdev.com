<br />^—What he said — only, one thing: why'd you make it a JPEG? :o I think it'd look better if it were a GIF — far less lossy, at any rate. ^^;

<br />
<br />Thanks guys; I was worried that it might be a horrible disaster to change the color so drastically. But now I think it looks a lot better too. Oh, and the character attacking him doesn't look unbelievably stupid like he did in the previous one.
<br />
<br />EDIT: No, it looks better as a JPEG. GIF makes it look very wierd, JPEG just makes it look a little blurred.

<br />
<br />I wouldn't say stupid, just before the presence of the character was not there. Because of the choice of color and the look of the character, it felt out of place.
<br />
<br />Now, both of them seems to be part of the same image, not 2 images sticked together from different artists.  The look of the character is now very good.
<br />
<br />As for my self (off topic), I dropped my previous one because it felt out of place <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /> I usually don't use avatar and I wanted to use one. Didn't know what to use so a took some very old thing I draw 15 years ago from when I started to program.  Now I took another temporary one but I like it better. But it feel less personal compared to my previous one.

<br />
<br />The character was supposed to be wearing black before, but obviously against a black background, this causes problems, so I made it blue to show up. But it looked dumb then. I made the character taller, and also decided to make him using one palette. Throwing a tan coat over the original outfit allows me to cleverly use one palette.
<br />
<br />Oh, and I've learned to use dithering to my advantage to create the look of more color options. That helps too.
<br />
<br />Anyways, pretty soon this should return to the original topic/be split. But I like talking about this...

<br />
<br />The current one?  Like BMF54123 said (while I was writting this mail) it's from Ninja Gaiden II. Took a screen shot with an emulator, trimmed it to fit in the 100x100 limit and it actually looking nice now. 
<br />
<br />I thought that taking Ryu would have been what everyone would have taken and be too cliche so I took a bad guy instead. I liked Asthar's style since the game came out so why not.  It look nice on this forum original colors too.

<br />
<br />And yeah both of your avatars rocks. The hero of Celius' avatar really looks cool with that coat, and it's true he didn't looks very good before. It's great there is people good at making graphics here. I'm not bad at making graphics I think but it just take me forever to do something decent. I should try everything 10 times at least before coming close to what I want and then I'm never satisfacted and apply tons of modifications long after I made the original graphics. This is especially if you have a websites with graphics from your game, that are frequently changing.
<br />
<br />I still don't know how to make the punk-needle belt thing look good on a relatively small sprite. I only have 3 colors (black, red, skin). Red dots surrounded by black are invisible, and skin dots really look weird.

<br />
<br /><img src="http://www.freewebs.com/the_bott/CeliusNESPortrait.JPG" alt="Image" />
<br />
<br />Here are some better models to compare:
<br />
<br /><img src="http://www.freewebs.com/the_bott/CeliusNESModels.JPG" alt="Image" />
<br />
<br />I think the sprite accurately portrays the picture. I like that I was able to do this with only 3 colors, as there are many more in the portrait. Oh, and before I tried to portray the hair as a more yellow blond. This looked really dumb, and I just think the more brown hair looks A LOT better, and it's easier for me to display.
<br />
<br />And Bregalad, you should put up a picture of what you're having trouble with. I found it surprising how easy it is to work with dithering and small sprites. Though sometimes, in really really small places, it can be more difficult.
<br />
<br />I actually haven't updated my site with much info. I just use it as a database. But maybe soon, I'll get a tech demo up with more info.
<br />
<br />Oh, and Tepples, or someone with the power, this really needs to split. It would be nice for this discussion to carry on, just not in this thread.

<br />Which platformers have more realistic graphics, better animation, better special effects in gameplay and an above average designed player to you? I always thought Ninja Gaiden was far above average in every aspect. The only thing it's missing IMO is AI for the enemies but that's typical of nearly all games of the time. BTW, Ryuu is a very uncommon name as it means dragon, and as such is only given to characters having something to do with dragons generally as an alias.

<br />Are you saving from MSPAINT? It uses a default palette for GIFs, which would probably screw up NES images.
<br />
<br />In my experience, sprite images ALWAYS compress better as GIF or PNG (provided you used a decent software to save it - one with OPTIONS) and they also look better, since there isn't any loss (with JPG there's always loss). JPEG was made for real-life images. Period.
<br />
<br />I know I have problems, but whenever I see sprite images saved as JPEG... well, I can't describe my feelings. It's just so wrong to mutilate the pixels like that! Specially when they look good, like yours. Many people still do it though, because there seem to be a myth that JPEGs are always smaller, which is not true. JPEG performs terribly on sprite images.
<br />
<br />Once I did a few tests with a few Genesis screenshots and PNG always kicked JPEG's ass, in both size (by a small advantage) and quality (by a great deal).
<br />
<br />I don't mean to be rude or anything towards you Celius, you probably saved it like that because all you've got is MSPAINT. If you want me to make a GIF or a PNG out of the original BMP I'd be glad to. If it's smaller and looks better, you might feel like using it.

Oh, and yeah, I actually hate JPEGs, it was just that compared to a bitmap it was smaller. Though only by about 70k.
<br />
<br />Is it really noticeable on the sprites? I can't really tell it's been PEGged (A verb used when one saves an image as a JPEG). The image on top is blurry too because I took it from Print Screen when I had FCEUXD open with that image inside. FCEUXD makes its games looked like they've been PEGged.
<br />
<br />I agree that it's really for real life images only though. You don't notice when you save a real life image in that format.
<br />
<br />Upon reflection, yeah, that portrait really doesn't look good saved as a JPEG. Well, here they are unPEGged:
