<br />
<br />Using an actual QD drive is crazy! Nobody in their right mind today would hunt down rare and expensive hardware (which they won't use for anything but FDS dumping) so that they could modify the disks or the drive and attempt to dump them using equally hard to find ancient J software or writing their own.
<br />
<br />The best way to dump disks is certainly through the RAM adapter. There is already a device that does this: the Pasodisk, but the hardware and software costs money and only dumps to the FwNES format.
<br />
<br />Maybe sometime there'll be my software I was working on to use. I've had a hangup though since NES emulators don't emulate low-level aspects of the drive correctly and right now I don't want to write a disk to test every other assembly.

<br />I would have sent you mine by now but the guy that has it (and bought it for me along with YJA goodies) has become a deadbeat and owes me $675, which I'm not sure if I'll ever see again.
<br />
<br />OT: You hear the news that eBay and YJA are going to start working together to help Yahoo sellers sell abroad over eBay? As strange as it sounds, it's true.

<br />
<br />I just need to find an MSX guru that can work his way around the system to tell me how to work the quickdisk drive and access it and such.  I bookmarked every page of every Backup Technique issue that mentioned anything FDS related, so maybe I should relook through them, because I thought there were some pages that mentioned the FDS and MSX systems on the same pages...they might have even contained the dumping programs.  After the Copytool translation, I got very complacent, almost disgruntled with the thgought of researching such a difficult thing further, especially when it takes me forever to effectively translate Japanese.
<br />
<br />Does the deadbeat live nearby either of us? <img src="./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";-)" title="Wink" />
<br />
<br />I will be very glad to see the day when YahooJ and eBay effectively work together.

Unless it is the sort of program that only cooperates on an ancient system, but I can't think of a good reason for that as long as you have the required legacy ports. Hell, you can access that port through XP, it's just a pain in the ass at times.

<br />Unless the systems with bootable USB are precisely the systems with an undervolted parallel port. Or unless, as was my case for about a year, you don't have a <em>working</em> CD burner to run the <a href="http://www.freedos.org/freedos/files/" class="postlink">DOS ISO</a>.

Or get a crappy old laptop with a power brick, since it will undoubtedly have a battery life of One Half of Ten Minutes. But I should be able to get it going with my desktop PC in theory. If I really wanted to be creative, and the parallel port voltage was low, I could probably rig up some fast transistors to bring it up to par.
