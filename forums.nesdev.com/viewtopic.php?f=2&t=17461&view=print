		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />So, I'm working on something that requires me to alternate between 2 side-by-side name tables every 8 scanlines (8 scanlines of name table A, 8 scanlines of name table B, then back to A, and so on). Can anyone think of a way to do this that doesn't involve using the MMC3 (or other complex mappers with IRQ functionality) or wasting nearly 100% of the CPU power on timed code?<br /><br />In an ideal world, DMC IRQs would be enough to time this, but somehow I doubt I could get something stable enough out of that. On the other hand, there is the fact that the window for writing to $2000 is huge, since horizontal scroll changes are buffered until the end of the scanline, so the timing doesn't have to be particularly precise, just enough for the write to happen anywhere in the correct scanlines.<br /><br />I might end up going with the MMC3, as that'd bring other advantages besides the scanline counter, but I though I'd ask here first to see if anyone could think of something I didn't consider. Thanks.

I think that's not what you wanted to hear though.<br /><br />DMC IRQs aren't precise enough for that, and you don't want to waste most of the CPU's time so the only way to go is developing a new hardware mapper capable of this automatically. By re-routing some adress line to CHR-A10 it should be doable easily, but will be havily non-standard and not emulatable.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />VRC IRQs are cycle based, rather than true scanline timings, so they might not be quite as good for chaining repeated splits like this.<br /><br />A restricted subset of MMC3 probably isn't too bad to build these days.<br /><br />A simple mapper that makes it easy could be great, too. Maybe something like the Punch Out mapper where reading byte 4 of a specific tile you place at the end of the line will trigger a split automatically. New mappers don't seem as big a problem to me as they used to, there's quite a few good actively developed emulators these days that might keep up.

The average joe (who possibly plays emulated games on their phone or raspberry pi) won't have access to an emulator that supports GTROM or other new mappers for quite a while, I imagine.  <br /><br />That's not an issue if you primarily plan to release on cartridge-only, or if you don't care to target the larger rom-consuming community. But if you do, then using a new mapper will still limit your audience for quite a while.  (and that's not even considering folks who have clones like the Retron 5, who may miss out when you use a custom mapper)<br /><br /><br />(I'm not trying to argue that a new mapper is a bad idea, heck, I'm using GTROM in the game I'm making. Just that there are potential downsides even IF you can find some emulator support)

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />good points gauauu, it then becomes a question of how you'd intend to spread the software. Unless it's a proof of concept for a small crowd. <br /><br />-an mmc3 type of thing is available for everybody as a freely shared ROM.<br /><br />-a cartridge release on a typical homebrew Kickstarter scale of 200-500 units (upper figure is rare) would benefit financially from having a cheaper mapper than an mmc3. Even if physical mmc3 games are doable like this, you need to reach a higher threshold to break even.

I'm not very good with hardware, so sorry if I'm way off, but my thinking is that whenever the top half of a tile is read, the left name table will be selected, and whenever the bottom half of a tile is read, the right name table will be selected.

I guess this is still all a bit too experimental for my taste, though... It's mainly the lack of support for this in emulators and Flash carts that bothers me. I could build a socketed cartridge for development, but that'd be far from ideal.<br /><br />EDIT: Wait, I don't need to latch the vertical name table selection bit, A11 can go through unmodified, but I do have to decide whether to drive the horizontal bit with the latched value (reads when A13 is high) or let A10 just go through (all other cases). Would that make 2 sets of 2 name tables possible?

The PPU natively provides two controls (PPU A10 and A11) to address 4 nametables (but only pre-provides enough memory for 2). But you can keep on adding more address lines as long as you have enough memory for it.<br /><br />For example:<br />&quot;Horizontal mirroring&quot; connects PPUA11 to CIRAMA10. <br />AOROM connects an output from the latch to CIRAMA10.<br />GTROM connects PPUA10, PPUA11, and an output from the latch (via extra hardware) to CHRRAMA10, CHRRAMA11, and CHRRAMA14.<br /><br />All of these are ways to allocate some number of chunks of 1K of memory to the region seen by the PPU.<br /><br />So there's a bunch of options, depending on just how much RAM you're talking about. If you wanted something like GTROM, but instead of having two planes of 4 nametables controlled by the CPU latch, you could instead just connect the output of the PPU address latch to the same extra hardware and end up with a single 64x120 &quot;stout tile&quot; display, corresponding to 512x480 pixels.<br /><br />Alternatively, you could also get away with just using the 2K of RAM inside the NES; then you'd have a single 32x60 &quot;stout tile&quot; display, corresponding to 256x240 pixels.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">It's mainly the lack of support for this in emulators<br /></div>Looking quickly at Mesen's source (especially OekaKids and MMC2), I bet adding support would be really easy.
