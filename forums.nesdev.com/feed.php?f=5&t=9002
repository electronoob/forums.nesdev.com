like I had said in my first post i have lurked this forum for quite some time.<br />I've been going by the name of "ratix" since 2007 or so been on quite a few boards like retrowaretv, playthenes.com (closed), screwattack, and a few other boards that changed their layouts on me that made me cry.<br /><br />I love games and I love the music from games whether it be on the 2600 to the latest system of the now although I should say I love the chipped consoles the best. <br /><br />My <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/ratix98" class="postlink">youtube channel</a> pretty much lets you know exactly what I enjoy doing. I love capturing audio mostly now, but I throw in a game once in a while.<br /><br />I want to say thank you to loopy, most of my nes collection can now collect dust with your mapper updates for the powerpak. I also want to say that your unfinished demo does not work on the powerpak as it crashes the system when the lines start to pick up pace D: but i have used nestopia to view it and its amazing. the nsf player is not bad at all too.<br />Thank you Mic_ for creating VGM2NES as it works <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_g2DmAUh_E&amp;list=PL5002D39C1567E52C&amp;feature=mh_lolz" class="postlink">wonderfully</a><br />Thank you memblers for creating such great chiptunes from comic bakery to some excellent covers of tgl. I have heard them way back when i was still using dialup back in 2003~2004.<br /><br />everything i had uploaded was captured using the hardware unless stated otherwise. <br />i also would like to say hi zen! sup roth!<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=5327">Ratix</a> â€” Mon Jun 11, 2012 8:37 am</p><hr />
