This limit makes it ineffective on PRG-ROM.<br /><br />Event viewer has a &quot;marked breakpoints&quot; option but the marked breakpoints don't seem to appear unless they are also enabled to break, but if I do that I can only see one at a time (since the event viewer only shows events since last break?)<br /><br />PPU CHR viewer has option to display on a particular scanline, but if you pause emulation to look at the same scanline I have to go into the debugger and manually advance to that scanline. It's nice to have the ability to see immediate PPU updates like this, of course, but it makes it really hard to e.g. advance frame by frame until the thing you're looking for comes up and inspect what that frame was up to at scanline 100.<br /><br />Though on that though a &quot;break on scanline&quot; feature might be interesting to have? Would kind of be a substitute for frame advance + see PPU on particular scanline.

I'm not sure how this is possible given the source code for that mapper, though, yet I can clearly watch it happen in the debugger and visually as the wrong CHR table is displayed.

When I hit the breakpoint here for $8000, I can see the event for the breakpoint I have just hit, but the others never show. If I turn the breakpoints on but leave them set to show, they never appear at all. They only appear when I actually break execution on them, and even when I do that I will only ever see the one I just broke on.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Thanks for the screenshots - the breakpoint events were getting overridden by the &quot;mapper register write&quot; (because they both happened at the same scanline+cycle) - fixed it so the UI keeps track of all events that occur on a given scanline+cycle, so the breakpoint events should display properly now.<br /><br />And based on the log you posted in the other thread, the most likely problem is that HasBattery() ends up being false (for both games?) because the save ram's size is set to 0 bytes in the NES 2.0 header.  This was to avoid loading/writing .sav files when there is no actual save data - I've changed this so that HasBattery() is still true, but the .sav files won't be created if the size is set to 0 bytes.  Hopefully both roms work properly with this.<br /><br />Build: <a href="https://www.mesen.ca/MesenMar15-2.zip" class="postlink">download</a>

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Following a discussion I had with Bananmos and after what felt like an eternity's worth of coding and refactoring, I've finally added source-level debugging support for CC65/CA65 projects.<br /><br />This adds a &quot;Source View&quot; that allows you to debug using the original source code (and step through it) and also offers a number of advantages over the regular disassembly view (e.g local variables, being able to see code that is not currently mapped to CPU memory, etc.).  It works for assembly &amp; C projects, but the C support still needs a bit more polish.<br /><br />Example:<div class="attachtitle">Attachment:</div><div class="attachcontent">
			<a href="./download/file.php?id=12210&amp;mode=view"><img src="./download/file.php?id=12210&amp;t=1" alt="sourceleveldebugging.png" /></a><br />
			<span class="gensmall">sourceleveldebugging.png [ 62.45 KiB | Viewed 1683 times ]</span>
		

		<br />
	</div>In the screenshot, you can see that the preview tooltip is able to display code that is not currently available to the CPU (the code for &quot;RenderLevelScreens&quot;).<br /><br />And here's what it looks like with a project coded in C:<div class="attachtitle">Attachment:</div><div class="attachcontent">
			<a href="./download/file.php?id=12212&amp;mode=view"><img src="./download/file.php?id=12212&amp;t=1" alt="cproject.png" /></a><br />
			<span class="gensmall">cproject.png [ 21.02 KiB | Viewed 1679 times ]</span>
		

		<br />
	</div><br /><br />There's also a new option to display the original source files as comments in the disassembly view: <div class="attachtitle">Attachment:</div><div class="attachcontent">
			<a href="./download/file.php?id=12211&amp;mode=view"><img src="./download/file.php?id=12211&amp;t=1" alt="showascomments.png" /></a><br />
			<span class="gensmall">showascomments.png [ 30.07 KiB | Viewed 1683 times ]</span>
		

		<br />
	</div><br />Feedback/bug reports on this feature would be very welcome, if you have CA65/CC65 projects to test it on (I only have a handful of projects that I currently test with).<br /><br />Build: <a href="https://www.mesen.ca/MesenMar18.zip" class="postlink">download</a><br /><br />To turn the feature on, you need to generate the .dbg when compiling and load then load it in Mesen's debugger (or turn on the auto-load .dbg file option).  Once a .dbg file is loaded, you can right-click on the code window and select &quot;Switch to Source View&quot; (Ctrl+Q by default) to turn on source level debugging.<br /><br />Also, when in &quot;Source View&quot; mode, all labels/comments defined in the debugger are ignored.  The source view's labels, etc. are taken straight from the .dbg file and cannot be altered (this was needed for a number of reasons).

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Very cool! I don't think I can use this feature, though... My linking configuration generates multiple output files, that I combine externally after assembling, so I imagine it will be impossible for the emulator to know where each line of code ended up in the final ROM.<br /><br />I tried it anyway, and while I can see all my source files, the emulator isn't able to follow the program's execution (i.e. it doesn't highlight the current instruction, breakpoints don't work, etc.), and the &quot;show source as comments&quot; option doesn't do anything either, which's expected.<br /><br />The reason I build my ROMs like this is because I want to dynamically align code/data of different sizes to the end of each PRG-ROM bank, so I need to assemble the end of the bank before the beginning in order to get its size and pad the beginning appropriately, which means I have to combine all the parts in the correct order after assembling everything.
