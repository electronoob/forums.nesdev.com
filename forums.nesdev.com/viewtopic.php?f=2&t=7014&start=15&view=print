<br />I didn't say that they're evil per se: I'm just biased because I never used them.  If used and documented properly, it should have it place I guess. But I saw some example in the past with no documentation and abuse of them (up to 5 or 6 +) so you can see that it can get quite messy in the hands of, I would guess,  beginners. So I would not add them in my "coding practices" for beginners.
<br />
<br />Nesasm:
<br />
<br />As for nesasm popularity, my only guess would be from a "mental image" of it.  If you want a "nes assembler", when you see the name "nesasm" then it seems to be the right tool for the job for someone looking for the first time for an assembler, isn't it? That's how I feel about it. I could be wrong thought.

<br />This sounds really great. Same that other assemblers lacks this - especially considering that loading code from ROM to RAM is common.

<br />
<br />This is how all of my labels look. They might be wordy, but at least you know exactly what each label is for, and I rarely ever have any problems with duplicate labels, or running out of names for labels. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" />
<br />
<br />Plus, if you ever start having trouble coming up with label names (too many labels), perhaps you need to revise your code's structure? <img src="./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" />

Being able to use local @symbols and +/- unnamed labels is what the assembler is for, to allow more concise expression of things, to do the tedious work so you don't have to (in this case, your eyes having to wade through increased noise).

<br />That's one reason why I use NESHLA, avoiding creation of such labels.

I do remember there being a discussion about on the CC65 email list many years ago, not sure what the conclusion was, but maybe there's some insight there if it's available for searching. x816 seemed like a pretty good assembler, I can't use anymore though without using DOSBox.  I mostly used it for my SNES 2A03 emulator, so it has to be assembled in DOSBox if I rebuild it anymore, heheh.  Nerdtracker 2 used it originally (later I changed Bananmos' old code to assemble in CA65) </div>
<br />
<br />About the SNES side: CA65 also supports 65816. But CC65 (C compiler) is very limited/incomplete for that CPU. also, DA65 does not support the 65816 yet!
<br />
<br />I tried using DOSBox on X816, Does not work, When assembling something with X816 in a DOSBox, It Stops Forever until exiting!
<br />
<br />This is why I use CA65 and sometimes ASM6

<br />
<br />x816 should work with DOSBox because I've definitely used it (it took a long time assemble the NSF player, which was funny to watch).  Maybe it uses a DOS 32-bit extender .exe that wasn't in your path when you ran it?  I guess it would've said so, though.
<br />
<br />ASM6 sorta reminds me of the x816 (for 6502) in some ways, I guess because it's simple and effective.
