		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />For now I am OK with Windows 7 in Classic theme, even if I miss the shemes like Rainy Day, it doesn't kill the OS or anything.<br /><br />There were several things that were horrible by default but I changed them back to normal, i.e. no title in status bar, big icons, etc... My only complaint is the start menu which can't be brought like it was before, which should really be optional. However I really got used to the new way, you just type the name of the program you want to launch and it finds it, it is quite convenient, more than searching through an unsorted list of 100+ programs. And don't say it's my fault for not sorting it - I had to do that with the PC I had on the campus which were not installed by me, and since they have all programs potentially used by students in the start menu, you get the idea...<br /><br />Linux in itself is fine, but it falls short as soon as you have to do <strong>anything</strong> exotic... like... programming the NES ?<br />Just do a search on RHDN, there is 583 utilities for Windows, but 8 for Unix... this speaks for itself. You could also use some of the 20 which runs with Java, though, so that would make it 603 vs 28, which means there is around 21.5 times more tools for Windows than for Linux.<br />Of course you could also use Wine, but if you go that far why not just use Windows ?

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />What's so hard about getting NES development tools set up in GNU/Linux? To set up an environment to build my projects, all you need to do (assuming a Debian descendant) is <tt style="margin-left: 2px; margin-right: 2px; padding:3px; background-color: #3355aa; color: white;">sudo apt-get install build-essential python-imaging gimp fceux</tt>, install cc65 from source, and download a project template for your chosen mapper. The foremost thing I have to use Wine for is FCEUX's debugger (and the recent versions of FCEUX that support mapper 28), and I use Wine instead of Windows because it's cheaper than running Windows in a VM in Linux or Linux in a VM in Windows, both RAM-wise and license-wise.<br /><br />As for counting utilities on RHDN, a lot of those are designed for making mods to existing proprietary NES games. If you are creating an original NES game from scratch, you probably don't need a specialized editor for some other game's script or map format.

The reason it will not be fixed any time soon is because most people either don't care, don't know any better to care, or have very poor taste in HCI design. Unfortunately interactive media is in a state where software companies have realized that if you tell people that garbage is gold, they will continue to buy it.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Found some time for a thread that is really something that annoyed me for a while!<br /><br />I guess engineer with time goes for what is practical instead of the fluffy/shinny stuff.  I was able to use windows 7 for a while at work with all the bell and whistle but I got tired and reverted back to classic mode since it was more practical in general.  Then I tried for fun windows 8, laughed, laughed some more then uninstalled it <img src="./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" /><br /><br />Koitsu:<br /><br />Regarding the font inside the control panel, there is a registry hack that allow you to put priority to the tahoma font (like windows XP) instead of Segoe UI. If you do that, the font will look crisp. There is still some font left &quot;broken&quot; in some dialog boxes, which I'm sure are still using Segoe UI because of WPF, but I didn't find a solution yet since I didn't have anymore time to put on this. I shouldn't have to go that far to bring back the classic mode like doing a registry hack to remove the annoying pop-up when putting my mouse over an app in a task bar. Maybe this thread is talking about the Segoe UI hack or is a good start:<br /><br /><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_7-desktop/disable-all-font-smoothing-in-windows-7-ie/f180e803-3317-4433-8fd2-63aadaecc2d2?page=2" class="postlink">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_7-desktop/disable-all-font-smoothing-in-windows-7-ie/f180e803-3317-4433-8fd2-63aadaecc2d2?page=2</a><br /><br />Since windows 8 this summer, I started to do something at work that I never imagined would because I have been using Microsoft OS since DOS 4.0: A Mac.  I had no choice because of a smartphone project. After trying windows 8, Mac OSX is not that bad after all. They may have done a lot of crap to the OS since Lion (it seems that Snow Leopard is their version of Windows XP) but it still not as bad as Windows 8.  At the least, the smoothed font looks a lot better than Clear type. For some reason, clear type looks like crap on some monitor (of course, the one I have at home) but not other. I don't have that problem with Mac OSX.  Even though I'm not a Mac fanatic, the OS is starting to get interesting compared to win8 and it future offspring.  The only reason I use Lion is because xCode requires it... That so Microsofish. Snow Leopard in other case is more than enough.<br /><br />I tried linux once in a while with every new version of Fedora and everytime I start to configure the UI in KDE or wathever, I always find a way to crash X windows. Maybe it's because of Fedora but still... That kinds of turned me off. And don't propose unbutu, for some reason, I don't like it. The only Windows Manager I liked was XFCE (I think). I got tired about linux because I always had to figure out what to configure next to make something work, because it never worked well every time you try to install something (dependencies, whatever).<br /><br />Since I never really been a Mac fan and I'm now becoming one, the end of the world thing in 2012 must be true then!...<br /><br />I was able to build ca65 on it, now I need to figure out what other tools to use. I may start another thread someday on the subject but I'm in no rush since I cannot work on my projects anyway!<br /><br />Edit:<br /><br />I just saw that mikejmoffitt posted just at the same time as me. His font look better in the control panel than the result I had. Maybe it could be related to asian font or something, like in windows XP? In window XP, if you do install asian font, it has quite an impact on the look of many UI elements.

Not an improvement over the previous paradigm in any way.

If I can find the right distro and windows manager. It was still on the back on my mind this week, it just I don't have the time to experiment much (taking care of kids, you know). I will surely try it again.  <br /><br />I just need to figure out a way to not destroy my current partition scheme like when I tried last time. I was just able to complete my hackintosh project thing (for &quot;educational purpose&quot; since xCode 4.5 won't run on the powerpc I received but that's another story), partition scheme in MBR (1 XP, 1 lion and 1 snow leopard) and I don't know if I install some linux distro at the end if it will destroy everything (extended partition thing with the swap partition, don't remember). But since windows XP is at the beginning it may not be an issue. I don't really need the snow leopard one anymore since lion seems to be working fine so maybe removing snow and putting the bootloader inside the linux partition will not wreak havoc. <br /><br />I'm derailing the thread so I will stop here! I love installing OS and play with them, I just don't have much time these days for &quot;that kind of geeky fun&quot; <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />

I work on the OS that supports the software I need to use, or is my target platform for work, etc. If I had a choice I'd use Linux, but I don't have that choice, really.<br /><br />Because of this, there's not much ability to vote with my wallet. Maybe if they started selling micro-features of an OS for small amounts of money, there'd be a better feedback loop, I dunno. (That situation sounds ridiculous as I suggest it, though.) You can complain on forums or whatever, but I think most development effort is focused elsewhere besides fixing the myriad of minor UI issues, so the message might even be getting through, but probably there's not much priority on it.<br /><br />Thankfully though, I don't find it hard to get actual work done in any OS I've tried. I have yet to see one that  I think actually impedes workflow significantly, though they all can be very frustrating at times (and of course, switching to an unfamiliar OS will usually slow you down until you learn how to get around it). The core stuff that lets you get to the software you want to use is generally pretty decent in any OS, because it has to be, otherwise the platform is probably doomed.<br /><br />I also find it funny that Microsoft usually chooses to do a big UI rewrite to make each version of Windows look &quot;new&quot; I guess. Sadly very new implementation has as many faults as the old. I'd appreciate it if they stopped doing that and started fixing the little things incrementally with each version, but I think they believe it's better for business to do it the other way.
