That's probably it.  The controller state somehow changed between the second and third read, fooling the game into starting with two players.  That wouldn't be an easy glitch to reproduce.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3506">strat</a> — Mon Feb 10, 2014 12:39 pm</p><hr />

It seems what happened had to be a glitch.<br /><br />And I'm starting to think it was a software glitch, because a) the original incident took place after a gameover and b) the game does five controller reads (E19C) and on pressing start, it compares the controller state for players one and two with the third read which is a dummy (E205).  If all three states are equal, a one player game is assumed.  This indicates PCE games have to do a software check for the presence of a Turbo Tap and second controller.  It's possible that somehow this check got skipped after starting over from the last game, giving the lone controller both players.<br /><br />It'll take more debugging to figure this out...<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3506">strat</a> — Sat Feb 08, 2014 9:45 pm</p><hr />

<em>Micro Machines</em> games have a tradition of letting two players share a controller: player 1 steers with the Control Pad and player 2 steers with the face buttons. The <em>Jeopardy!</em> games for NES have players 1 and 3 sharing controller 1 in the same way. The 2-player minigames in <em>WarioWare Inc.: Mega Microgame$</em> share a GBA, with one player using the L button and the other player using R. I imagine that any one- or two-button game could be adapted in this way.<br /><br />Next you'll probably tell me &quot;two girls, one cup&quot; wasn't about how Peach and Daisy won the championship trophy in <em>Mario Kart Double Dash</em> or <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjBolZ69QHs" class="postlink"><em>Mario Power Tennis</em> doubles</a>.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=9">tepples</a> — Wed Feb 05, 2014 12:58 pm</p><hr />
