By that definition, I'd like to know what kinds of hardware (accessories and add-ons) or software for the NES would be considered &quot;unemulated&quot;.<br /><br />I've heard the following is unemulated, not well emulated, or not 100% emulated:<br /><br />* Miracle Piano<br />* Power Glove<br />* R.O.B. + its functionality in Gyromite and Stack-Up<br /><br />I'm not particularly interested in unofficial or &quot;pirate&quot; games.

I've tried to figure it out based solely on the ROM before, without much luck (but my 6502 assembly skills were even more terrible back then than they are now).<br /><br />I have 17 audio+data tapes recorded in .wav format for it (sent to me by a Japanese user of Mesen), but never managed to figure out how the game reads the data stream from the tape.  If you ever decide to give reverse engineering it a try, let me know.

Nestopia UE has very diverse input support (check out Machine -&gt; Input -&gt; Expansion Port for a list of all the wild Asian stuff), and may be the only emulator with support for such &quot;regional-specific&quot; hardware.  I think VirtuaNES might be another.  FCEUX has some interesting devices in it (esp. for mice), but Nestopia UE has all the really &quot;odd&quot; ones (odd to us in the West anyway).<br /><br />The documentation that is available now (but wasn't several years ago), that covers a large number of devices from all over the place, is over at nocash's site here:<br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://problemkaputt.de/everynes.htm#controllers">http://problemkaputt.de/everynes.htm#controllers</a><!-- m --><br /><br />I do have a question: is the focus on every <span style="text-decoration: underline">accessory</span> that's unique, or just input/device protocols that are unique?  I think it's the latter given the examples given, but I wanted to ask.<br /><br />If my question isn't very clear, here are two examples of the former:<br /><br />- Acclaim's Wireless (Infrared) NES controller -- an absolutely horrible device (I owned one!) -- uses the standard NES controller protocol, AFAIK, but it's a wireless NES controller with awful lag and coverage/reliability.  So it's a unique accessory, but not literally emulated (what would there to be emulate, the lag? :-) )<br /><br />- The Hudson Joycard Sansui SSS, which is a NES controller with adjustable turbo support for A/B, and a mono headphone jack for audio (w/ adjustable volume).  The audio comes from the NES's RCA audio out jack.  Again: a unique accessory but not literally emulated (what's to emulate?  Most emulators already have adjustable turbo A/B support)<br /><br />Finally, there is one particular device I don't think any emulator has emulated, and no documentation is available on it: the Famicom modem: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://problemkaputt.de/everynes.htm#modems">http://problemkaputt.de/everynes.htm#modems</a><!-- m --><br /><br />I actually have one of these and would be happy to donate it to someone who wanted to try and RE the interface protocol and the underlying BIOS/firmware.  I'd love it to send it to nocash, but shipping to Germany is $$$.  I could certainly disassemble it myself, and dump the BIOS (assuming its IC is 1980s-common), but I'd feel better giving it to someone more hardware-savvy.  I do not have any cards for it, I just have the device.  I also think most all of the Famicom dial-up services via POTS have shut down, but IIRC, several remained running until very recently.<br /><br />You can find Youtube videos of almost all of the devices I mention above.<br /><br />Great thread, BTW!

I think it's the latter given the examples given, but I wanted to ask.<br /></div><br /><br />I meant to put a definition on accessories but couldn't word it correctly earlier. Let me try it this time. I guess I'm looking for accessories that actually caused the gameplay itself to change in some way. That is to say, when using the accessory, the gameplay is discernibly different or unique. On a technical level, I suppose that would be saying the code accounts for the use of an accessory versus not having the accessory. A good example would be the NES Four Score: gameplay changed from 2 players to 2-4, and the game is uniquely programmed for with/without the accessory. A counter-example would be the NES Advantage, which is just a controller variation as far as I can tell.<br /><br />That's the kind of distinction I'm interested in. Unemulated hardware like that changes the experience, even if ever so slightly, so as a matter of digital video game preservation, I'm taking stock to find out what gaps we currently have. Mind you, I'm not saying all accessories aren't important (some of the stuff available is absolutely fascinating for 80/90s technology) but my focus is on gameplay for the time being. For many items that do not change gameplay, we run into the problem you noted: what would there be to emulate? Some stuff might be fun for hyper-realism (like the lag you mentioned on IR controllers) but perhaps for another day  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /> <br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">koitsu wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">Finally, there is one particular device I don't think any emulator has emulated, and no documentation is available on it: the Famicom modem: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://problemkaputt.de/everynes.htm#modems">http://problemkaputt.de/everynes.htm#modems</a><!-- m --><br /></div><br /><br />Oh, that's a good one! Added to the list then. That's something I'd really like to see documented one day. It's a shame I'm not well versed at all in 6502 ASM or have any familiarity with the NES hardware, else I'd offer to help some how on that front. Like I said, my domain is in Game Boy stuff, and there's already a ton of things I have on my TODO list (recreating online servers, carts with built-in IR diodes, <em>a sewing machine</em>). My goal here is to organize a list and hopefully bring attention for other emudevs here and elsewhere.<br /><br />Anyway, thanks for the info koitsu! These details are very helpful.

You need to select &quot;Famicom&quot; in the input config window to see the expansion device dropdown (which is probably a requirement I should get rid of since it makes them harder to find). It also has the only open source Battle Box (external storage) implementation that I am aware of (based on nocash's documentation).<br /><br />And yea, I think there are at least 2? different modems for the NES, and none of them have been emulated afaik.  But then you'd also need to emulate the remote server to be able to use any of the features the modem offered (which would probably be hard at this point in time).  Of course you could arguably emulate the modem &amp; allow 2 emulated modems to communicate over the internet, but that's probably a bit too niche for anyone to use in homebrew software :p

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />@Shonumi -- understood! Your explanation makes total sense (and is much better than mine).  :-)<br /><br />I have lots of folks who follow me on Twitter given my SNES/NES background so <a href="https://twitter.com/koitsu2009/status/1012538725849415680" class="postlink">I tweeted out mention of this thread</a> in hopes it gets more eyes thus potentially more devices.<br /><br />@Sour -- It's been a while since I've tried Mesen, but great to know.  I wasn't even aware that a lot of this stuff had been documented by nocash -- I always thought peripherals had been neglected (esp. those from Asia), e.g. tribal knowledge + reverse-engineering emulator source + &quot;oh there's this one .txt file that's in broken English&quot;.  But peripherals I never focused on much.<br /><br />And yeah, there's at least 4 models of modems.  I know which one I have and will have to see if it powers on + boots into a FW/BIOS of some kind.  Literally have no idea how it works/what its behaviour is.  But if it's got a FW/BIOS that's EPROM-based then I could certainly dump it.  I won't have time for this until next week.

When the original cartridge dumps became available, the Super Magicard images were tossed aside. These Super Magicard images were already conversions; the original distribution method of copier games were FDS disks, and many of them were not even for the Front FarEast's copier models. While I agree that iNES-format FFE hacks are basically worthless, I do believe that copier FDS disks are worth preserving in their original formats, i.e. as disk images, and that would imply emulating copier hardware using their respective BIOSes as well.</li><li>There are at least two variations of the Subor Mouse that are currently unemulated.</li><li>That <a href="https://forums.nesdev.com/viewtopic.php?t=16657" class="postlink">Mapper 178 Ping Pong game</a> has some sort of infrared sensor that is currently unemulated.</li></ul>

I'm pretty sure at least the Game Genie doesn't initialize the palette immediately, I don't know of any other examples.  You'd see it all the time if your connector was bad, hehe.

I once owned an exercise device that connected to the SNES, but I've never found any information about it online anywhere.  It was a chair where the seat was mounted to a stationary base frame via some sort of spring.  Using a motion similar to a rowing machine, you would press your legs against stationary pads in front of you and the seat would move backwards.  But the seat could also pivot in 4 directions, serving as the D-pad.  The remaining controller buttons were on stationary handle bars attached to the base frame.  In other words, you changed directions in the game by literally wiggling your ass.  I'm completely serious.  And it was not a bicycle.  I wish I still had it.  I don't even know the name of it.  If anyone has any info on this, please let me know.

You could emulate it as completely random as an option... or a choice of colour would probably be just as good.<br /><br />It seems pretty unlikely to me that anything interesting would be found in a game as the result of palette RAM being initialized some particular way, but cosmetically choosing your startup colour could be fun.

Still gathering a list for other consoles as well, but when I'm done (or when I think I'm close to done) it'll be public. I'm thinking about making some notes regarding possible misinformation that needs to be corrected. For example, on this page: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://emulation.gametechwiki.com/index.php/Nintendo_Entertainment_System_emulators#Peripherals">http://emulation.gametechwiki.com/index ... eripherals</a><!-- m --><br /><br />Stuff like Karaoke Studio is listed as &quot;unknown&quot; for emulation status, and I think Dwedit mentioned the Miracle Piano on reddit last year (and the link above lists that as unknown), so any false positives that can be eliminated, I'll definitely have a section about them and write down any supporting emulators.
