I do agree though that the wiki should explicitly denote that unless there is both WRAM and internal RAM, PRG-RAM should denote internal RAM.<br /><br />Also, Dokuganryuu Masamune has no WRAM. Nescartdb is wrong on this; the additional glob performs some kind of internal RAM protect, if I remember correctly (lidnariq has investigated this, I think).

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />All right. Let's try this again. There are three kind of N163 save data situations:<br />Situation 1. N163, no WRAM, no battery. Most games. Can be expressed in iNES (1.0) by simply not setting the battery bit.<br />Situation 2. N163, no WRAM, battery. This means the game saves its data inside the N163 chip. Cannot be expressed in iNES (1.0), as most NES emulators will assume that the battery refers to the $6000-$7FFF area. (fwNES from 1998 being a notable exception).<br />Situation 3. N163, WRAM, battery. This means that the game saves its data using WRAM, and uses the N163 chip RAM for audio or not at all. Easily expressed in iNES (1.0), as it works like any other mapper's save function.<br />There is no N163 game that uses WRAM but has no battery.<br /><br />The only iNES 1.0 problem in need of a solution therefore is situation 2. I assume that kevtris proposed to use submapper 1 for this. One could indeed do that.<br /><br />But: NES 2.0 not only has submappers, but also PRG-RAM and PRG-NVRAM fields, and emulators interpret them whether we want it or not.<br />We must therefore define correct PRG-RAM and PRG-NVRAM values for all three scenarios, unless we say that situations 1 and 3 may not have a NES 2.0 header at all, which would be absurd.<br />The problem is that once we specify PRG-RAM and PRG-NVRAM fields for all three situations, however we do it, submapper 1 necessarily will become redundant.<br /><br />What are the correct PRG-RAM and PRG-NVRAM fields for each of these three situations? My understanding based on the above description was:<br />Situation 1. BATT=0, PRG-RAM =128, PRG-NVRAM =0.<br />Situation 2. BATT=1, PRG-RAM =0, PRG-NVRAM =128.<br />Situation 3. BATT=1, PRG-RAM =128, PRG-NVRAM =8192.<br />This is based on the assumption that the 128 bytes of internal chip RAM count as PRG-RAM because they can be used for any purpose by disabling sound output. The spec and previous discussions implicitly assume this (and that may be the problem).<br /><br />Now, lidnariq stated in the thread I linked to that the PCB is such that one cannot connect the battery to the 8 KiB WRAM chip without also connecting it to the N163, so 3 would have to be specified as:<br />Situation BATT=1, PRG-RAM =0, PRG-NVRAM =8320<br /><br />And since 8320 cannot be specified because it must be a power of two, and because we did not want to round up to 16384, the sentence &quot;If a cartridge has both a dedicated RAM and RAM in the mapper (such as that of Namco 163), and both or neither are battery-backed, include only the size of the dedicated RAM in the header.&quot; was added to the wiki, so Situation 3 is now specified as:<br />BATT =1, PRG-RAM =0, PRG-NVRAM =8192 if one insists that the N163 is technically battery backed, OR<br />BATT =1, PRG-RAM =128, PRG-NVRAM =8192 if one is willing to ignore that.<br />This is the current spec, as I understand it, which is quite hard to explain.<br /><br />Now, one could be of the opinion that <em>because the N163's chip RAM is not directly mapped into CPU address space</em> at all, it is a special case and should not be included in the PRG-RAM/PRG-NVRAM fields at all. This would be okay since mapper 19 already tells us that there are 128 bytes of chip-internal RAM that are only accessible via $4800/$F800. The three situations would then be described as:<br />Situation 1. BATT =0, PRG-RAM =0, PRG-NVRAM =0.<br />Situation 2. BATT =1, PRG-RAM =0, PRG-NVRAM =0.<br />Situation 3. BATT =1, PRG-RAM =0, PRG-NVRAM =8192.<br />Which would be very consistent, and which I would like very much, but is contrary to the current spec and contrary to all previous discussion on the subject. And again, the PRG-NVRAM field would already disambiguate between situations 2 and 3, making submapper 1 redundant. I think some people did not like the sight of a header saying &quot;a battery with 0 bytes of PRG-NVRAM&quot;, and stock Nintendulator indeed complains about that.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I got a much better idea after reading that old thread. I had misidentified Hydlide 3 in my list by mistake, and lidnariq claryfing that WRAM and N163 are always battery backed together or neither was a big lightbulb.<br /><br />As for iNES 1, in that case WRAM is always assumed and battery should presumably just save the N163 as well. Is there any compatibility issue there? (Does Mindseeker or some other game rely on open bus at $6000?)<br /><br />Assuming our goal here for iNES 2 is accuracy and not merely compatibility, it seems that N163 RAM should <em>always</em> be saved if battery backed. Doesn't matter that it's not used, for accuracy's sake it <em>belongs</em>. There <em>should</em> be no such thing as an 8192 byte save for N163 in terms of accuracy, but an emulator could detect 128 byte or 8192 byte files if they exist and interpret them in a compatible way to fill the RAM.<br /><br />So... the only remaining issue is just whether it's got 8k of WRAM or open bus at $6000.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">NewRisingSun wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">Situation 1. BATT =0, PRG-RAM =0, PRG-NVRAM =0.<br />Situation 2. BATT =1, PRG-RAM =0, PRG-NVRAM =0.<br />Situation 3. BATT =1, PRG-RAM =0, PRG-NVRAM =8192.</div><br />I think this last suggestion works very well for this, and removes ambiguity. &quot;BATT=1, PRG-RAM=128&quot; in the other suggestions is an inaccurate fiction because it can't not be battery backed, right? That last suggestion also removes all need for specifying this with a submapper, which is good too. Makes the audio mix submappers easier to implement, and is pretty cleanly open for 129 or other variant compatible subspecies if they ever appear.<br /><br />(As for what's on the wiki, derived by telephone tag with Kevtris and tepples, I don't think it's actionable, and I'd suspect probably doesn't even effect his Analogue NT thing anyway. I'd vote we replace it with this ^ instead.)<br /><br /><br />So, deprecated submapper 1... looking at it again maybe it doesn't have the meaning I thought. Maybe this means &quot;WRAM not present&quot; (redundant) or maybe it means something about the battery needing to be saved, in which case it's like submapper 0 but with a redundant &quot;battery save the N163&quot; hint, not compatible with the audio mixing effort but we don't need to care about that -- it will be a compatibility mapper, not an accuracy one.

I was proposing to add to the NES 2.0 wiki page &quot;The PRG-RAM and PRG-NVRAM fields apply to memory, both ASIC-internal and ASIC-external, that can be mapped into CPU address space. It therefore excludes the Namco 163's chip-internal RAM.&quot; But that would be incorrect as well, because the PRG-NVRAM field was explicitly designed to also handle serial EPROM, and that one cannot be directly mapped into CPU address space either.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I don't think we need to tear our hair out trying to make every rule universal. Maybe there will be some special cases we can't iron out. A rule of thumb that works <em>most</em> of the time is still practical.<br /><br />The specifics for what to do about N163 should really be on the N163 page, IMO. I sort of back-linked it from there earlier while trying to get a handle on the information, but really I think any mapper with internal RAM or something similar is a special thing that needs to be explicitly detailed on its mapper page. We can allude to them on the NES 2.0 page, but probably better to state a rule of thumb there and then make a list of links to the mappers it effects.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />So the NES 2.0 wiki page would simply state: &quot;The PRG-RAM and PRG-NVRAM fields, as a general rule, describe the amounts of non-battery-backed and battery-backed RAM, both ASIC-internal and ASIC-external, that are mapped into CPU address space. Special rules apply for mappers with RAM that is not mapped into CPU address space ([[Namco 163]]) and for mappers with serial EPROM ([[INES Mapper 016]], [[INES Mapper 157]], [[INES Mapper 159]]). For these mappers, it may be permissible to have the battery bit set, yet PRG-NVRAM having a value of zero.&quot;<br /><br />The Namco 163 page would state: &quot;The NES 2.0 PRG-RAM and PRG-NVRAM fields have non-zeros value only if there are 8 KiB of additional WRAM on the PCB. They do not include the 128 bytes of chip-internal RAM. This means that for games like <em>Mindseeker</em>, which save data to battery-backed chip-internal RAM, the NES header's battery bit will be set, yet PRG-NVRAM will have a value of zero.&quot;<br /><br />I have to think about what the Mapper 16/157/159 pages should say about that.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Doing some digging, but I didn't find any open bus access in Mindseeker.<br /><br />I did notice that FCEUX had a header hack for the 5 games that had battery but no WRAM to force the header on. Masamune conspicuously absent, but I assume this is due to the persistent idea that it had WRAM.<br /><a href="https://github.com/TASVideos/fceux/blob/master/src/ines.cpp#L278" class="postlink">https://github.com/TASVideos/fceux/blob/master/src/ines.cpp#L278</a><br /><br /><br />So... my guess is that Kevtris had it on his radar for iNES 2 because of being on CRC detection lists, but mistakenly not due to a need in the iNES 1 spec, just bad headers from people clearing the battery flag if no WRAM.<br /><br />As such, I think submapper 1 most probably means specifically: no WRAM, battery backed. (Whether the emulator should enforce or override conflicting settings elsewhere in the header, probably up to them. I don't think this needs to be defined rigorously for a deprecated submapper.)

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />The Mapper 16 page would state: &quot;Some games have 256 bytes of serial EPROM; they must have the NES 2.0 PRG-NVRAM field set to 256 and the battery bit set. Games without serial EPROM must have the NES 2.0 PRG-NVRAM field set to 0 and the battery bit not set. Games with 128 bytes of serial EPROM must use Mapper 159.&quot;<br /><br />The Mapper 159 page would state: &quot;This mapper is only used for games with 128 bytes of serial EPROM. Although redundant, for consistency with Mapper 16, they must have the NES 2.0 PRG-NVRAM field set to 128 and the battery bit set.&quot;<br /><br />The Mapper 157 page would state: &quot;The Datach unit has 256 bytes of serial EPROM which is shared among all Datach games. The battery and PRG-NVRAM fields of the NES 2.0 header do not refer to the Datach unit, but only to the game cartridge itself. Only <em>Battle Rush: Build Up Robot Tournament</em> has an additional 128 bytes of serial EPROM in the game cartridge itself. This means that all other Datach Games must have the battery bit clear and PRG-NVRAM set to 0. The emulator, when seeing mapper 157, will maintain a common 256-byte save file for all Datach games. For <em>Battle Rush: Build Up Robot Tournament</em>, the battery bit must be set, and PRG-NVRAM must be set to 128. This causes the emulator to emulate the second game-specific EPROM in addition to the common Datach unit EPROM.&quot; Right now, Mapper 157 is another ambiguous case, and this proposal would rectify that.<br /><br />Opinions on these PRG-RAM/NVRAM ideas (and the revised Namco 163 one)?
