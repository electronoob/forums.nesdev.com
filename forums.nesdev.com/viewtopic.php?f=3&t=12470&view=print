It sets NMI_occurred at dot 1 of scanline 241, but it intentionally delays the NMI until dot 150 of that scanline (~50 CPU cycles after it probably should be executed).  Without that delay, the text boxes in Marble Madness do not get rendered correctly.  I also found other minor glitches appear in games without that exact delay.  I assume I'm not accounting for 50 CPU cycles somewhere and a few games start counting cycles from the start of NMI.

I hardcoded that as a test and it produces a clean road with and without my 40 CPU cycle NMI delay hack.<br /><br />The <a href="http://wiki.nesdev.com/w/index.php/MMC3#Mirroring_.28.24A000-.24BFFE.2C_even.29" class="postlink">MMC3 docs</a> do not mention how to configure 4-screen mirroring.  I'll have to research that further.<br /><br />Edit: The <a href="http://wiki.nesdev.com/w/index.php/INES#Flags_6" class="postlink">iNes file flags 6</a> specifies that it is a four-screen VRAM game.  I modified my MMC3 mapper to not allow the game to control the nametable mirroring when the file specifies four-screen.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />FCEUX 2.2.2 provides better trace logging that includes instruction CPU cycles.  I started recording when the text boxes appear at the start of the first stage of Marble Madness and I compared that log against a log from my emulator.  <br /><br />When I delay the NMI handler by 40 CPU cycles, not only does it fix the rendering, but every instruction matches up between the logs cycle-per-cycles.  Each frame ends with a spin lock waiting for the next NMI:<br /><br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">$FC5A:4C 5A FC&nbsp; JMP $FC5A</div><br /><br />Consequentially, delaying the NMI handler by 40 CPU cycles ultimately results in that spin lock spinning 13 fewer times.<br /><br />If I remove the NMI handler hack and let NMI take place on dot 1 of scanline 241, the text box rendering gets screwed up, but still every instruction matches up between the logs cycle-by-cycle until it reaches the sprite 0 hit test at the bottom of the frame.  Marble Madness appears to use a sprite 0 hit test to hide the last few scanlines, presumably to conceal graphical artifacts that would result from vertical scrolling.<br /><br />In this case, the loop that is waiting for the sprite 0 hit test absorbs the difference.  In fact, if I add a hack to delay setting of the sprite 0 hit flag by 40 CPU cycles, then the logs once again fully match up.  This suggests that the CPU instruction timings are correct, including things like OAM DMA stalls.  <br /><br />How could the rendering be out of sync with the processor by 40 CPU cycles if the timings are valid?
