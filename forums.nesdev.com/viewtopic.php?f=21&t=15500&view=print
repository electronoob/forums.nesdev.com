		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Well, it's an NES game, and I'm not quite sure if I'm going to sell it. You don't have a time constraint, and if you don't feel like using YY-CHR, then I'd be happy to let you just draw it on graphing paper and emailing me the scanned document. Here is my E-mail address: <!-- e --><a href="mailto:clanin.evan28@gmail.com">clanin.evan28@gmail.com</a><!-- e -->, and the pixel constraints are 16x16. since this is an NES game, you are limited to three colors excluding the background. The colors you will be using (Excluding the background) are Black,Green, and Brown.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />MS Paint is sufficient for this sort of design. Asking people to make the designs on paper (while IRL thats how they did it) is a bad idea because drawings on paper can look more impressive than what the nes can actually do, so you might be faced with a challenge of trying to cram something impossible into the limits of what the nes can do (detail-wise). XP-version of ms paint is good for this because you can have the nes palette pasted right into the image and a 16x16 block or any permutation you can have with 8x8 tiles right there to draw on.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I was going to suggest the same (sorry, my previous post was written in a hurry). If there's already some graphics assets, and you are after a certain style, it might be a good idea to post and describe those so different artists/assets producers/gfx designers can see if their range of styles comply to your idea, or have ideas on directions you might like.  <br /><br />Regarding format, i think most users on this forum are comfortable working with tools such as PS, inDesign, blender, GIMP, various sprite tools, and custom NES tools such as NESST and YY-CHR. Drawing on paper can sometimes be useful for me (different processes lead to different results), but normally, i do things directly in the NES bitmap format for the sake of time efficiency.
