<br />That's what most Genesis enthusiast say. And they say this because the CPU is the only big point where the Gen beats the SNES, it's likely not that they prefer the Gen because of it's CPU. Just like now PS3 enthusiasts wich say it's better than the Wii because of it's faster CPU, wich makes no sense in gaming terms.
<br />I have yet to find SNES games that annoyingly slow downs. I found Mega Man X boss battles are quite fast paced and intense. Castlevania IV slows down a bit, but it's nothing to write home about, and it's a SlowROM game. Most games (and hironically along with Mega Man X) are FastROMs, running at ~3.?? MHz instead of ~2.??? MHz.
<br />
<br />Anyway, anyone will most likely like the game console he had played first, and for me I played the SNES first (I never played a Genesis outise of emulation actually).
<br />
<br />Also, why I have nothing against the Genesis or Genesis enthusiasts, I definitely refuse to admit that FM syntetis allow for more creativity than a full sample-DSP processor. Not only nothing prevent people to make PCM samples from a FM synth and convert them to the SNES format, but also using original samples with full use of pitch and enveloppe of the SNES CPU can get a lot more expressive than anything. And it's definitely wrong to say the Genesis unique PCM channel can output something equivalent to the SNES : Not only you get only ONE channel, but it lacks echo, enveloppe and pitch modulation as opposed to the SNES ones. And yes, creative use of special noise/waveform samples and pitch modulation feature, along with the noise generator, can make very exiting sound effects competing against FM, while I totally agree that plain recorded sound effects mostly sucks on the SNES (lack of trebbles makes boring sound effects).
<br />
<br />The only dual SNES/Genesis game I've ever played was Battletoads &amp; Double Dragon. Hironically, I found the Genesis version better than the SNES, but not as good as the NES. Cannot explain why, tough.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Last I checked, extremely few games had ROMs fast enough to handle sustained CPU operation at ~3.58 MHz on the SFC/SNES. As far as colors; on the MD you can really get away with a lot using creative dithering methods. NTSC/PAL's video 'flaws' can actually provide a poor-man's antialiasing that makes a few colors seem like many. Properly used, this can have dramatic effect, causing a sprite to look like it has literally tens or hundreds more colors than it actually does. A lot of early titles ignore this capability, but it really comes down to the artist.
<br />
<br />While of course you can record an FM synth and play it back as PCM, who really did that? It's more interesting to see how composers expressed their ideas in a limited medium to potent effect through FM, just as it is to listen to a complex, well-programmed chiptune on the NES, versus something built primarily from just some notes and pre-recorded samples. Again that comes down to opinion but most SNES games sound like a low-grade PC MIDI to me, not anything glorious, and so I prefer the more creative application of the MD's PSG/YM2612.
<br />
<br />For that record I like how the TGFX16/PC-Engine sounds better for the same reason, and in a lot of cases the NES' 2A03. The TGFX16/PCE provides vastly more versatile audio waveforms however.

<br />
<br />I've been using trackers long enough to notice there's just an extreme amount of possibilities with samples.  Yes, if you have really good samples you can almost get away with mediocre composition.  It allows for some laziness.  It's harder to do that with FM, it just sounds too generic.  But a good song, done properly, will sound good on any hardware.
<br />
<br />With samples, there's no rule that everything need to be pre-recorded sounds.  It was just the trendy thing to do.  One could very easily edit your own samples to turn the SPC into 8 square wave channels (kind of interpolated though, so they won't be perfectly square-edged).  Check out the Censor's SID player for SNES, or my NSF player, they sound pretty close to the original chips.  The SPC wouldn't have any trouble emulating TG16 sound too.  Some SNES soundtracks I like, Drakkhen for example, hardly use anything but simple waveforms with ADSR envelopes.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />That's very creative; it just doesn't apply to the majority of games. Likewise there are some MD and TGFX16/PCE games that do a poor job of showing off what good FM is capable of. A feature a system had but never used doesn't hold up too well in comparing 2 systems' histories, though. For example the SFC/SNES had support for VERY high video resolutions, it was just too slow for practical use most of the time and required a very simple scene with minimal processing due to the CPU overhead when that mode was in use.
<br />
<br />Likewise systems like the Saturn showed lots of potential that most games didn't properly tap, resulting in performance similar to the PSX on many titles when the Saturn had more raw power on tap.
<br />
<br />Another example; the PCFX, a very powerful and versatile machine with terrific 2D capabilities and a powerful CPU, plus LOTS of RAM, but rendered totally useless because all its software is crappy dating sims that could run on hardware years older.

<br />Wow!  Sonic the Hedgehog displays 1000s of colours!  Just look at the rainbows in the water.  Now that's realism!
<br />
<br />I'm sorry for all the sarcastic joking, but yeah, a few arguments presented here are desperately jumping around from invalid point to invalid point.  Yes, there's a thing called dithering, but it's been around for millions of years (crosshatches in primitive drawings, etc.).  The MD certainly doesn't have a monopoly on it, as any SNES game can use dithering too.   (Though I'm not sure truly sure why it'd want to, with such rich shades to choose from.)

This limits other tasks like complex object movement and game logic which must be simplified to prevent slowdown. Of course, however, you are correct in that the CPU is not physically drawing tiles dot by dot, that is indeed the PPU's job.
<br />
<br />The Sonic games are a very poor example of use of dithering. In fact they're some of the few games that often look better with RGB rather than benefiting from the effects of composite video on a good display. A better example is Ecco 2 (Tides of Time) or Gunstar Heroes which made frequent use of 'flaws' in composite/RF video.
<br />
<br />Nowhere did I say the MD/Genesis had any sort of a 'monopoly on dithering'. My point is; if the same visual effect can be achieved without a more advanced VDP, it would tip matters in favor of the MD.

<br />However, doing the same image in the highest resolution available would require 4 times more VRAM than it on low resolution, because this means 2 times more pixels vertically and horizontally.
<br />Also, high resolution is only available vertically for sprites, if I remember correctly. Only 2 BG modes (5 and 6) allow high resolution horizontally, wich only allow few backgrounds layers with few colors/particular effects available.

<br />That really makes me laugh, because the Genesis sounds EXACTLY like very old MIDIs. Bad SNES soundtracks sound like averagely old MIDIs, and good SNES soundtracks sounds awesome. If you say this, you should never have played SNES games with awesome sound such as Secret of Mana, Chrono Trigger, Tales of Phantasia (and Tactics Ogre, too). Then you should have only played games such as Zelda III and Soul Blazer, both having horribly bad use of the SNES's sound.

<br />
<br />I don't know if I'd call them terrific...then again, it depends on perspective.
<br />The maximum number of layer in hardware is 4 "KING" backgrounds, 2 legacy VDC backgrounds, 2 legacy VDC sprite layers, and 1 JPEG/RLE layer(intended for motion decoding, it can be used for other purposes, like environmental effects in Miraculum and Zeroigar).
<br />
<br />HOWEVER, there were limitations.  If you wanted to use scaling+rotation with a tile map and tile data, you would eat up all KING RAM access slots, and only be able to display 1 KING background.  Also, using the higher-colored video modes reduced the number of backgrounds displayable(for each pixel drawn on the screen, the KING chip could only do 2 16-bit RAM fetches into internal buffers). 
<br />
<br />You can display 32 VDC sprites per line, but only if you stagger them between the two VDCs, and only with 16-color sprites...if you want to use the 240-color mode for VDC backgrounds or sprites, you'll halve the VDC background or sprite capacity(in numbers and available memory).
<br />
<br />Also, the horizontal resolution was...lacking.  The KING backgrounds and motion decoder background can only be displayed at a horizontal resolution of 256, while the VDC layers can go slightly higher, to about 341 pixels wide.  However, if you put the VDC into the higher horizontal-resolution mode, layer alpha transparency is disabled.  Even when layer alpha transparency is enabled, it can only be applied when mixing the layers from different devices...
<br />
<br />
<br />If games wanted to have decent music(the PSG in the PC-FX was functionally identical to the PCE, with 2 ADPCM channels tacked on), they could either use streaming ADPCM(which sounds ok, but has a rather high noise floor), or CD-DA(takes up a TON of disc space, though the CDROM drive in the PC-FX can vary the playback rate to some degree, which could reduce storage requirements, but I don't think any games did that).  I suppose it would have been possible to make a software mixer as well and stream that, but it may take too much CPU time, and the hardware doesn't make such a thing easy.

However, the Genesis only sounds like bad old MIDIs on games where the musician didn't know how to use the YM2612; on games like <em>Zero Wing, Sonic The Hedgehog 3,</em> or <em>Street Fighter II,</em> where the game was either ported from arcade hardware with a similar chip or created specifically for the Genesis by someone who knew how to use an FM chip, it can be quite good, especially as Yamaha's FM chips provide a very clear, smooth sound.

For example Zeroigar could've been pulled off on the SNES save for the full motion video (and who really wanted it anyway?)

<br />Well, I hate Sega vs. Nintendo arguments-- this is a discussion of the hardware issues. Sega did a lot of stupid shit that ruined them, and their hardware was often like they just threw components at the wall to see what stuck, and sometimes they just got lucky (the minority of the time..) while Nintendo succeeded by being business-smart, building cheaper and more profitable hardware and locking in lots of developers (through often devious but effective practices) to ensure the most use came out of it. Prime example: SMS vs. NES: Which was the ultimately more powerful system? The SMS. Which one had 98+ of the fun software? Hint, it starts with N and ends in ES...
