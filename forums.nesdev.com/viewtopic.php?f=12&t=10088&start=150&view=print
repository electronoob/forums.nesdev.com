I just tested FF3 on a 4MB board without any issues playing up to the first couple battles.<br /><br />Can you confirm that you're using the current release of firmware and software on my site?  I don't expect an issue with Danin's release, but to be safe, I'd like to confirm that you're using my build of things until I get some 4MB boards in Danin's hands at least.  I just programmed the 3MB file as-is with the 3MB dropdown selection and played in HiROM.  Nothing special on the setup programming, doesn't appear mirroring of the last 1MB is necessary at least up to the point where I played a few battles.<br /><br />FWIW, paying my rom in an emu reports a good checksum of crc32:A27F1C7A  which looks to match up with jbradfields report.<br /><br />So if you can confirm the error on my firmware and app (perhaps you already have), let me know.  Shoot me an email and I'll get you swapped out with replacements as it sounds like it's just your board.<br /><br />So are both jbradfeild and satashi26 having the same exact issue still?  That makes me a little curious.  I'll have a fresh board pulled from the assembly line this weekend and see if anything similar is going on there.<br /><br />If there is anything else you'd like me to try specifically let me know.

My statement earlier that it's not a problem with the INL cartridges means I don't think it's a problem with the design, it might be a problem with the particular cartridge or something like that. Because obviously other people (such as myself) have had plenty of success with them.</div><br /><br />Thank you for taking the time to test, however with more details we might come to an actual conclusion. IE, CRC value of your Rom, which software/firmware you were using, etc.<br /><br />Information helps us determine the cause of the problem. In fact, other things such as the version number written on the cart might help. My 12MByte board says v1.1 in pen and that leads me to believe there is at least a v1.0 design out there, which may perform differently, or have some difference that is causing the trouble..or perhaps the v1.1 boards have a problem and the v1.0 board does not.<br /><br />I simply find it difficult to believe that so many people are having problems with this specific set of Roms and that they all have a dirty socket/faulty power supply/etc causing only these games to not work. If you could be so kind, please share further information. If we can get to the bottom of this, and it's an issue with my firmware or software, I'd love the opportunity to fix it. Thank you.<br /><br />Edit: Hey there INL, didn't see your reply there. If there's anything you'd like to know from my end, you know where to find me. I did some one-on-one with satashi and everything there checks out but it still won't run. From what I understand, satashi has five boards, but now that I think about it, I don't directly remember if the problem was encountered on multiple boards. I suspect so, but I'll check in and verify this unless we hear a report back before then.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />FWIW I tested on a new 4MB board which should be equivalent to anything shipped in the past couple weeks.  It's the newer pcb rev v1.1 (in silk), but the CPLD rev is 1.1 (pen) which should match everything shipped in the past 6 months or so.  Mottzilla's might be older than that IIRC, I'm guessing he's got a v1.0 CPLD, I know he has a v1.0 pcb.

I'll run a couple more tests when I get home tonight.</div><br />  To be specific, my software pads the Rom (with 0xFF) to the size it reports that it is in the SNES header (not the 512-byte dumper header) before Mirroring or HiRom mapping it.<br /><br />  Of course, when uploading as HiRom it <em>always</em> makes sure it's mapped right, so wether it needs direct remapping or not, it is always auto-padded to its reported size with HiROM. I may change this behavior if it's reported to cause these issues, but apparently even with the stock INL 1.1 software the same issue is present. In LoROM it doesn't bother filling the cart unless the user specifically requests Mirroring, though in HiROM it does fill the entire cart every time.<br /><br />  I don't think that has anything to do with the issues reported though, since the problems are reported with stock INL 1.1 software too. If we find I'm wrong, I'll change the behavior to whatever is needed.

I know of at least one 10 Mbit game that relies on mirroring (hint: what's the Roman numeral for that many Mbit?).</div><br />Thank you for the information.<br /><br />With that clarification, I will update the behavior of my app. I've been told where my logic was faulty - I improperly thought that a 3MByte game that reports as 4MByte was, in actuality, using a 4MByte Mask Rom with empty space at the end. In actuality, it's a 2MByte Mask Rom paired with a 1MByte Mask Rom. I'll further verify, if I can, wether this is universally the case, and update the program's behavior to reflect what I find. (Edit for incorrect wording.)<br /><br />To relay the information as discussed in private (to avoid flooding the thread) for future reference:<br /><div class="quotetitle">tepples wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"><div class="quotetitle">Danin wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">I was under the impression that dumps were truncated to the length of valid data and the rest of the Mask ROM was empty, in the case of a 3MByte Rom from a 4MByte cart.</div><br />What does the hardware do when accessing &quot;empty&quot;?<br /><br />These 24 Mbit games have two physical ROMs on the PCB: one 16 Mbit and one 8 Mbit. One of the address lines from the cart edge (A21 in HiROM) determines which ROM is used for a given access, and the address line connected to the 16 Mbit ROM's highest address input (A20 on the ROM and on the HiROM cart edge) isn't connected to the 8 Mbit ROM at all. This means the ROM ignores that bit of the address, and this ignoring behavior produces what the CPU sees as ROM mirroring.</div><br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">tepples wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">Mask ROM has a cost per pin and a cost per megabit. Yields were such that the marginal cost per megabit of a 32 Mbit ROM over a 16 Mbit ROM exceeded the marginal cost of two ROMs over one. Remember that Famicom cassettes had two ROMs (PRG and CHR) in about the same board size as a Super Famicom cassette or Super NES Game Pak.</div><br /><br />As such, the nature of my mistake was assuming a single 4MByte chip with blank space at the end that was truncated by the dumpers. My assumption was incorrect, as they use two chips to match the exact size of the ROM data - the larger first, smaller second, and since SNES read access to 'off-chip' space wrap backward (depending on configuration) the SNES CPU will receive - in the case of this situation - two 'mirrors' of the smaller chip's data.

Very polished so far has worked for all roms have tried out.  Excellent work and compliments the int board perfectly.</div><br />That's what I'm shooting for..hah.. And I'm glad to hear you enjoy it. I've put a lot of work into it, and I'm nowhere near done. There are certainly a few bugs, usually related to scenarios I can't test yet, since I don't have access to every set of boards...I'm working on it though, I should have the other boards fairly soon. I have big news for the next update that should come this weekend, and the larger your cart is, the better the news is. Keep an ear up for it over the next day or two.
