		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Today I had the chance for the first time to go to the Tokyo game show with one of my coworker.  It's been 5 years that I wanted to go but there was always something that happened so I always couldn't. 
<br />
<br />Warning: wall of text.
<br />
<br />First impression, it was quite big, many booths but it's packed with people.  It was hard to move around and with the weather today, it was hot like hell.
<br />
<br />It was good to be able to see the latest games in action like Ninja Gaiden 3, Binary Domain etc but see was mostly what you could do.  It you really wanted to try something... Get ready to wait between 1h to 2h.  With that kind of waiting time, you cannot try anything at all.
<br />
<br />We were able to get a few trinket here and there, some fliers but it seems this year they were not giving that much (my friend went a few time in the past).  
<br />
<br />So since it was hard to just try something we decided what should be "the" thing we should waste our time waiting for?  We decided like most people to try the PSP Vita.  Man it was hard to be able to get there. Every time we went it was "sorry, we don't take people anymore".  We had to pass a few time in front of the booth before we could actually wait.  During the walking around for a chance to Vita, I saw Hideo Kojima on stage explaining something but I didn't have time to listen to him unfortunately (?). 
<br />
<br />Once an opening came out we took any game that we could (you had to decide which want you want to try) and we ended up on Ultimate Marvel VS Capcom 3.  We had to wait almost 2h to try it.  It was hard when you wait standing, hot and sweating, just to try it.
<br />
<br />I had big expectation since I love portable games but after trying it... I don't think I will buy one from beginning (at the least).  It seems the focus was put on both touch screen to compete with smartphones and forgot about "traditional gamers" even thought there is 2 sticks and a lot of buttons. The buttons are sooooo small! My hand are small but I can cover all 4 buttons with my thumb!  For a fighting game... That was a little bit annoying.  We could play exactly 8 minutes (there was a timer) and that's it.  It gave me the same impression that when I tried the 3DS: nothing special, what the hell they are doing.
<br />
<br />All in all, it was an interesting experience, there was cos-players here and there but I would prefer if you could try something at the least.  Do to so, you have to come early morning and wait huge line already to enter and maybe comes both day.  I don't have that kind of time anymore.  And less hot would be great.
<br />
<br />What was new was smartphones games. It's the first time it was at this show and the booth for one maker, Gree, was very big. Since those games don't attract as much people because the show is for traditional gamer, it was easier to navigate that booth.   The star of the show was the PSVITA but after seeing it, it was quite underwhelming.

Is that how big they are?<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">For a fighting game</div>
<br />Compare Killer Instinct 2 and other fighting games on Nintendo 64 that used a Street Fighter style six-button layout.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />For the ds lite, I can cover them too.  The size are almost similar, maybe the same or smaller. But the dslite form factor is smaller than a PSP and a PSVITA is bigger than a PSP.  So having smaller buttons felt strange. The DS Lite button felt more comfortable too.
<br />
<br />Maybe you get used after a while, who knows. I could only play once for 8 minutes but the impression was not good.  I may get one when the price go down but not from the get go. That will give me more time to try it at the store and see if my impression change with more playing.
<br />
<br />Different subject but still related to today's impression,  I was no fan of smartphones like game but I think the 3DS/PSVITA will get a beating.  They tried to appeal to casual gamers but they should have focus on "gamers", that's it.  Casual gamers are not ready to pay that much for games in general. They got used to the app store pricing with 1$ games and that kind of destroyed that segment. Now people expect that game should be that low. You cannot survive on that kind of price unless you have some other way to make money out of it.
