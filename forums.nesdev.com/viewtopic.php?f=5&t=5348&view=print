<br />
<br />I seem to recall a user named donknotts being banned because he posted stuff in the General Stuff section like this:
<br />
<br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://nesdev.com/bbs/viewtopic.php?t=1581">http://nesdev.com/bbs/viewtopic.php?t=1581</a><!-- m -->
<br />
<br />That simply had nothing to do with NESDev. Also, a lot of the reason behind Jargon's ban was that he abused the General Stuff section, posting things unrelated to NESDev. Do forgive me if this doesn't count, though I am still curious why one would post this on NESDev and not a board dedicated to political issues...

<br />I would help if he could explain to us why he finds it pertinent to have such conversations here. Most of the time it looks like he's just goofing around, and goofing around with serious topics is not a very nice thing to do.

But I think the discussions should at least be interesting/constructive/pertinent (at least one of those! <img src="./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=":wink:" title="Wink" />) in some way.
<br />
<br />I don't exactly approve any sort of prohibition though, like making a list of what's appropriate to discuss and what's not (what I said about conflicts and tragedies before is how <strong>I</strong> feel about such topics, bot others are free to talk about that if they want and things don't get messy). But things can sometimes get out of hand, and then I believe is time for some locking and/or banning, but always on a case-by-case basis.

<br />
<br />Those are all of the most recent topics created by WedNESday in the General Stuff forum before (well after, actually) something related to NESDev comes up in the list:
<br />
<br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://nesdev.com/bbs/viewtopic.php?t=4564">http://nesdev.com/bbs/viewtopic.php?t=4564</a><!-- m -->
<br />
<br />Most of the time, it's not so much about NESDev. But I guess since no one is complaining, whatever. I'm pretty sure though that we've had this discussion about the General Stuff forum, and that it's been sort of established that there should be some relevance to NESDev. But I could be wrong I guess.
<br />
<br />EDIT: I agree with tokumaru about starting these kinds of topics. You'll end up with a thread that looks like YouTube comments (basically everyone calling each other offensive things and having no maturity/grace whatsoever). And I guess I'm wrong to some extent about what should be talked about here. I think it starts getting unrelated once there's no electricity involved  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /> . I suppose programming/computer talk is okay, because that's still kind of related to development of software, which is sort of related to NESDev. That would mean some of those threads above would be okay/not too off topic. I guess it is nice to have a break every once and a while from NESDev, but this topic has absolutely no place on this board, in my opinion.

<br />
<br />Yes I do like to goof around sometimes for fun, and yes my last 10 or so posts have been for fun, but the 440 odd before that weren't (save a few). The reason I haven't made any NES related questions for a while is that I haven't had the time to program much recently.

<br />- So, why don't you stop with this? Believe, you're <strong>not</strong> a bad guy <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /> but NES-related suits better here. Yup, you have freedom to discuss politics in another forum.
<br />
<br />- Speaking of... The rules must be updated. Looks like paranoia, but needed.
