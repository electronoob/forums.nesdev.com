		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />scanty and I have been discussing this for the past few days, and have decided to post it here.
<br />
<br />FDS files are by definition flawed. Mitsumi's quick disk format, as used on the fds, literally stores a stream of data (MFM or RLL encoded) on the disk, in a spiral track. All that current fds files contain is the data from all of the disk blocks, concatenated together in a big stream.
<br />
<br />This is wrong for a few reasons:
<br />1. The crc16 values at the end of each block are missing. at least one game checks for this as part of its copy protection scheme.
<br />2. The pre-gaps before each block are missing. again, its possible to check this.
<br />3. Data which is not encoded in the standard 'fds format' of nintendo fds disks, which is sometimes present at the end of the disks, is missing. at least one game REQUIRES this data in order to function!
<br />
<br />We're planning to modify an FDS unit by combining it with a copynes, to be able to inject our own code and read the ENTIRE DISK, sequetially, to the parallel port. This should produce dumps which are somewhat larger than the existing dumps, but should be 100% accurate reflections of disk contents.
<br />
<br />What we still need is this:
<br />People with expertise on FDS programming. marty from nestopia has some information on this, I'm hoping to get his input
<br />Someone with access to LOTS of FDS disks. X-or from the nesdev forums seems to know someone who does.
<br />Input from people with experience. You can help too! Your Ideas are welcome!
<br />
<br />Lord Nightmare

X-or from the nesdev forums seems to know someone who does.<br />Input from people with experience. You can help too! Your Ideas are welcome!<br /><br />Lord Nightmare</div>Due to the hi price of FDS disks, Yuki and I bought, dumped and sold immediately in order to buy more. A lot of sealed disk were "sacrified" to get cleaner dumps, and we lost a lot of money when reselling those. We are perfectly aware about the flaw in the current FDS dumps but there is nothing we could do about it. We did what we could with what we had, this is sad but that's it.
<br />
<br />If you look for someone with a huge collection, I'm afraid you will need to search elsewhere.
<br />
<br />Today the No-Intro FDS database is the cleanest database on the web, and we will be glad if you can contribute cleaner dumps.
<br />
<br />About the missing data, once a few "proper" dumps are created, we will probably be able to rebuild the missing data in our clean dumps. Calculating a checksum and adding it is no problem.

<br />That's not how it works, rebuilt images should be immediate grounds for redumping since you CAN'T rely on the structure of the disks. The only way is to read a disk byte for byte until the end of the track. It's also useless to redistribute new dumps until a file format is adopted, I use a file per side with EOF signifying the end of the track, that seems the most logical to me.

<br />
<br />If you want to go ahead and create bad dumps before people even start redumping, go ahead, all the info you need is in this document: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://nesdev.com/fds-e.txt">http://nesdev.com/fds-e.txt</a><!-- m -->

<br />I will analyze your 1:1 copy against a FDS copy and see if anything can be rebuilt

<br />doesn't that mean real disk missing data (crc and gap data) can be rebuilt?

<br />
<br />A perfectly dumped game can have bad formatting or bad CRCs. If you want a perfect dump, you cannot take a .FDS file and convert it because you do not know if the original disk has perfect formatting or not. Everyone is 100% sure some games do not follow the conventional format. It should not be assumed that all games have perfect CRCs for the files either! As a ROM scene guy you should know that a good dump can have a bad CRC. If you fix that CRC, you have just created a new bad dump.

<br />And as a scene guy I know that 100% of licensed commercial Super Famicom cartridges and 100% of licensed commercial Nintendo64 cartridges use correct checksum(s). For both of those systems, there is not a single instance of a licensed commercial cart with bad checksum. At all. 
<br />
<br />But that were times where Nintendo had the monopole of media manufacturing. I suppose those disks with bad format were not manufactured by Nintendo since at that time every company could produce their own media.
