I have been told the 8080 family expects arrays to be aligned to the start of a 256-byte page, so that the program can load the field number in L and the object number in H or vice versa, but then any array with fewer than 256 elements wastes the remainder of the page. For the cases I'm considering (10-30 fields of 5-20 objects), aligning them without <em>crossing</em> pages is easy, but aligning them to the <em>start</em> of a page appears trickier. Would I have to consider the RAM as an &quot;atlas&quot; analogous to a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texture_atlas" class="postlink">texture atlas</a>, with RAM being a two-dimensional array divided into rectangular sub-arrays, each with object index as one dimension, field index as the other dimension, and a stride of 256 bytes?<br /><br />Some 8080-family coders suggest organizing data for a single-instruction, multiple-data (SIMD) approach that steps through two arrays at a time using DE and HL. For example, a program would update object positions in four passes: add horizontal acceleration to horizontal velocity of all objects, then add horizontal velocity to horizontal position of all objects, then add vertical acceleration to vertical velocity of all objects, then add vertical velocity to vertical position of all objects. Pixel shaders on modern graphics programs work similarly. But that doesn't work so well when a particular operation needs to be performed only on particular types of object or only in certain circumstances, which is often the case for enemy AI code that has to determine the accelerations for each object based on collision response, displacement to the player object, and other factors.<br /><br />If I have asked before, and I am asking again, it's because when I did get an answer, it was one that I couldn't understand how to apply. Hence &quot;wrapping my head around the Z80&quot;. Would basic questions like this be better received in a forum organized around a particular platform using an 8080 family CPU, such as <a href="https://spectrumcomputing.co.uk/forums/viewforum.php?f=6" class="postlink">Spectrum Computing</a> (or, in the case of other platforms, <a href="http://www.smspower.org/forums/" class="postlink">SMS Power</a> or <a href="http://gbdev.gg8.se/forums/" class="postlink">gbdev.gg8.se</a>)?

Those IX/IY instructions are looking nice at first glance, but they are so slow that one should usually avoid using them, or use them only in not so timing critical higher functions, or, in rare cases, where they are faster than opcode constructions. But in general, using LD A,(HL) is fastest. If you want to read from HL+1, HL+2, etc. just increment HL. Or increment L, that a bit faster, as long as no 100h-byte page crossing is needed.<br /><br />When comparing C64 with Z80 systems like Spectrum or CPC, I would say that Z80 is a good bit faster. Parts because it's having more register &amp; requires less memory accesses, and parts because it's having 16bit load/store/add/inc/dec instructions. The drawback is that Spectrum and CPC need to do sprite rendering by software.<br /><br />Yeah, I've spotted that 2-dimensional array indexing trick via H and L in several CPC games. It's somewhat cool, but it's also a bit messy, and INC H isn't that much faster than using ADD HL for switching to the next array entry, so, in most cases I've &quot;cleaned up&quot; the code and removed that technique after disassembling the game.<br />Btw. I was always believing that it's been a 6502 technique that had crept into Z80 world when people ported C64 games to CPC. I haven't checked if the original C64 code had used the same method, but it would make more sense there (since the 6502 can't easily do something like ADD HL for incrementing 16bit array indices).<br /><br />There are a few more cases where one case &quot;see&quot; that many Z80 games came from C64, like cases where the C64 needed a handful of opcodes to do some operation, and the programmer blindly reproduced that code - although the Z80 could do the same thing using only a single opcode.

And of course you could try to move the most often used entries closer to index +0 so you won't need the +5 stuff too often.<br /><br />The gameboy doesn't have a real Z80 (it doesn't have any IX/IY registers), so one would actually need to use HL in the above fashion.<br /><br />On CPC and Spectrum it might be best/easiest/fastest to use (IX+n) for the enemy logic in some places - but, on that computers, the main CPU load will go to software rendering, so the speed of the game logic doesn't matter too much, and it's more important to use fast opcodes in the rendering functions.
