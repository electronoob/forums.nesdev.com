Few people who run 64-bit Windows or Linux or OS X are going to buy a copy of 32-bit Windows to dual boot.

Atleast that's what I assume you meant.</div>Yes, that is what I meant.  Being tied to the PC (and slow USB transfer rates) is a pain if you're programming a significant number of carts.  Using a SNES cart as temporary storage for the rom image means it only takes seconds vice tens of seconds to minutes for programming.  That and no PC needed to flash once the SNES cart is loaded means you could have multiple kazzos going all at once independent of a PC if desired.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">darkhog wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">But how about putting simple flasher in the cart itself? You'll just connect pc via usb with cart (by means of USB port on cart itself), pretty much like you do with kazoo. Given it won't require connectors kazoo does, as power and data would go through USB cable into rom chips, it probably would be cheaper than cart+kazoo combined (though one could reflash cart after buying game, but it is their problem).</div>It's not as simple (nor cheap) to program two separate large parallel roms as you're making it out to be.  Your suggestion more than doubles the hardware cost of my current discrete mapper boards.  Not to mention the increase in design complexity.  That said, I am working on <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/viewtopic.php?f=9&amp;t=10357#p116196" class="postlink">a design</a> that would only have serial rom (all parallel memories are ram.) which makes programming the rom with a cheap mcu and USB cable reasonable for production.  While that could be adapted to run on a SD card as you're requesting, I'd still say it's a waste of money for publishing a typical homebrew game.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">tepples wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">As I understand it, Kazzo/INL-Retro also doesn't work so well on any operating system other than 32-bit versions Windows.</div><br />I've yet to get any such reports, are you having troubles?<br /><br />I run on 64bit windows7 all day long, as do numerous customers of mine.  I've had reports that it works on windows8 too (64bit IIRC), although updating the firmware had to be done on a windows7 machine for now.  qbradq <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/viewtopic.php?f=9&amp;t=7912&amp;start=240#p120322" class="postlink">just got his running</a> on Linux...<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">lidnariq wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">No, 64-bit windows requires driver signing.</div>Call me naive, but I've been ignoring this 'requirement' for years with no reported issues.

Say, do you plan offering things like cart cases so our game won't be lonely board with some printable sticky label that we could draw cart art on or print, then stick to cart plastic?<br /><br />Another questions: <br />- Will you offer something like PowerPak in future or other kind of &quot;dev&quot; cart that is able to emulate/have multiple switchable mappers on board? I've heard it isn't made anymore and ebay prices are outrageous<br />- Can full kazzo-flashable boards be flashed multiple times (e.g. to test different version of game on actual hardware)?<br />- Do you sell pre-assembled boards with famicom connector? I got recently famiclone which for obvious reasons can't play NES games so this is all I can test games on (it's one of better famiclones though, Pegasus IQ-502). It'll be some time before I'll be able to put my hands on actual nes though.
