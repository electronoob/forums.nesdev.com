<br />
<br />For the ''SEGA 8-BIT CONSOLE SERIES'', Check out SMS Power
<br />
<br /><a href="http://SMSpower.org" class="postlink">http://SMSpower.org</a>
<br />
<br />For the MEGA DRIVE/GENESIS, Try Sega Retro 
<br />
<br /><a href="http://SegaRetro.org" class="postlink">http://SegaRetro.org</a>
<br />
<br />Google is useful for finding websites like these!
<br />
<br />If you are also interested, a Fansite like them, called World of Spectrum has info on the old ZX Spectrum (the Dizzy series originated on this computer)

<br />The basic with the forum is made by an enthusiast. You can make a simple game with it, for sure (one example is <a href="http://devster.monkeeh.com/pub/Kung-Fu.zip" class="postlink">Yie Are Kung Fu port</a> from NES). It is compiled, and with 7 MHz M68K it is not that slow.

Seriously the game slows down while fighting CutMan if he throws his projectile as I recall which the NES version didn't. 
<br />
<br />That's not to say that you couldn't make a decent game in C for Genesis. Maybe 68000 compilers generate better code today too. But as with any system certain things will discourage homebrew development such as Sound &amp; Music tools as well as alternative development platforms that may be more appealing or easier.

<br />
<br />1. The graphics on the Genesis are a bit beyond my reach as far as creating them.
<br />2. I have very little nostalgia for that system, and that's a big motivator for me.
<br />
<br />These points are also the reasons I have not pursued development on the PSP (other than some kernel-mode stuff), PSX, GBA, DS and Jaguar. Point 1 also applies to the SNES, and point 2 applies to everything released before the NES.
<br />

<br />Heh, this is a funny point for me. You know, I have <strong>zero</strong> nostalgia for the NES... I didn't have one as a kid, and in the few instances I had contact with them I was too busy snubbing my friends because I had a Genesis. 
<br />
<br />Despite that, the NES is my favorite system nowadays. Actually, all 8 and 16-bit consoles and computers fascinate me, if I had the time I would program for them all! For some reason I picked the NES, maybe because I was amazed at what some games managed to do with the hardware, once I got to know it through emulation.
<br />
<br />Since I can't code for all the systems I'd like to, the ones I actually plan to make games for are the NES, the SMS and the Atari 2600. Out of these 3, the NES is the only one I don't have nostalgia for, but it's still the one that gets most of my attention!

<br />Me neither. I have more nostalgia playing games in Nesticle than I have playing them on my NES... because that's just what I did as a kid.
<br />
<br />The first console I had as a kid was the original Playstation by the way. I'm sure interested in this system but unfortunately it's very complex and at the present time quite poorly documented.

For Playstation dev you can look here: <a href="http://jum.pdroms.de/PSX/psxdevstart.html" class="postlink">http://jum.pdroms.de/PSX/psxdevstart.html</a>. It's very similar to the PSP in terms of hardware and kernel structure (which is <a href="http://www.psp-programming.com/tutorials/c/lesson01.htm" class="postlink">very well documented</a>), although the APIs and hardware are a lot different. There's also a lot less RAM and a much slower clock speed.
<br />
<br />Also there is a lot more assembly done on the PSX due to the lower clock speed, and the low-level graphics interface is much different.
<br />
<br />So yea, I guess it's <em>kinda</em> like the PSP <img src="./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" />

<br />
<br />Agreed.
<br />
<br />Edit: So unlike me to not ramble on, so I think I will <img src="./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" />
<br />
<br />I recently developed an XBOX 360 game through their <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/aa937791" class="postlink">indie development program</a> and it was exactly like developing any other PC game, except the API and platform had all kinds of bugs and random exceptions that you had to put up with.
<br />
<br />After that experience (and the $2.00 an hour I made off of it <img src="./images/smilies/icon_redface.gif" alt=":oops:" title="Embarassed" />) I realized that game development on the side is not likely to give me any type of supplemental income that would make a difference in my lifestyle, so I might as well do what I love. And then I remembered the lovely green-and-black site I spent so much time reading in 2004, and it was all down hill from there <img src="./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" />
