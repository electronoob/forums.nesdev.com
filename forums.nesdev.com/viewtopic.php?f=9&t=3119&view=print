		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />OK I know this has probably been covered but I have an NES cart witch was originally a crystalis (US) I removed the mask ROM's and put in a AT29C020 I left WE pin unconnected (because I figure I don’t have to write to it so that’s ok?) and the OE connected to ground everything else is connected to its counterpart  sept the no connection pin on the chip and extra CE on the board (pin 2)
<br />
<br />I have Project Q (J) loaded into the flash to test it 
<br />I put the board into my game genie so I do not have to reassemble the cartridge and plug it into the NES I get past the GG screen the game starts sound and everything is working fine sept video is doing that blocky white thing were you can almost make out the picture 
<br />
<br />What am I doing wrong? 
<br />I actually remember reading how to fix this 2 years ago but cant remember/find it sorry for my foolishness
<br />
<br />edit:tryed connecting WE to 5v but that did <span style="text-decoration: underline">not </span>change anything
<br />
<br />Edit2: also tried soldering OE directly to pin 14 on the mmc3 as someone suggested it would be a good place for it, but same result as ground
<br />
<br />Edit3:I tryed a differint game as a test Shaffle Fight (J) same resolt.  Now im out of ideas and am going to bed if some knows what I need to correct please do tell
<br />
<br />edit:4 tryed it without the GG STILL not working

<br />Sounds like an error in the CHR wiring. Can you take a photo of your TV or a TV-in screenshot while your NES is misbehaving?

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Did you replace BOTH chips (PRG and CHR) ?
<br />Did you tie WE high to BOTH chips ?
<br />Did you apply the rewiring needed because Nintendo mask roms have a slightly different pinout (I guess the modifications for 27C20 also applies to 29F20, the only difference is the WE pin instead of VPP, because writing to an EPROM is obviously impossible, and a Flashrom doesn't need any other supply than VCC).
<br />Did you connect /OE of the PRGROM to ground, and /OE of CHRROM to the cartridge CHR /RD signal (actually there is no /OE driven by the MMC3 as you seems to mention) ?
<br />Did you connect /CE of the PRGROM to pin 14 of the MMC3 (NOT /OE) and /CE of the CHRROM to cartridge CHR A13 signal ?

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />so far I have onley put the PRG ROM in and the 2 games I mentioned I am useing to test my work have no CHR ROM so I just removed the stock one for now, that ok right?
<br />ill let me get my Vid capture card to take a photo and have one soon
<br />
<br />This is what I did the first time around and get no differint resolts with outher things I have tryed so far, if nothing is wrong is thery I am just going to redo my wireing sence I did most of it a few years back and now I am much more skillfull I assume its not due to the /CE on "pad" 2 on the board not being connect to anything

<br />
<br />If the game is running and you get sounds the prg wiring is probably all correct.

<br />if thats the case then no problem, thanks loads guys
<br />
<br />too bad for me I did not read that before I desoldered my socket I knew I missed something I assumed the nes could access the PPU with internal RAM

<br />
<br />is there any additanal connections I must change when the orginal had a 128k and I want a 256k in there
<br />
<br />I ask because I did it normally following <a href="http://nesdev.com/NES%20EPROM%20Conversions.txt" class="postlink">this</a> and I get a lot more color but still not correct  its like solid colors with white and black lines with a few game colors showing
<br />although the socket I am useing could be to blaim as its not in great condition
<br />
<br />the orginal game had a 128K CHR I now want to put a 256k I followed the trace from pin1 to pin 12 (chr A17) on the mmc3 so  everything is correct, at least all the addresses seem to be
<br />
<br />edit:removed socket soldered in chip directley same problem

<br />This shouldn't cause you problems. Make sure you get all CHR rewiring correctly (use a ohm-meter or short-meter).
