<br />
<br />There's one last issue that I have (for now.  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=":wink:" title="Wink" /> )  Check out Yellow's tracks 3 and 7.  The drums (Noise) sounds like it desyncs with the rest of the audio in track 3, and there's a Noise channel active in track 7 that shouldn't exist at all.  Those are just 2 examples, so I'm guessing there's a bunch more problematic tracks.
<br />
<br />EDIT:  Listing all the bad tracks I can find: (Yellow)
<br />3
<br />7
<br />11
<br />12
<br />16
<br />19
<br />20
<br />21 
<br />22
<br />34
<br />37
<br />38
<br />40
<br />49
<br />
<br />In short, it's all the tracks that use Noise at some point.  All of Pikachu's voice clips (the last bunch of tracks in the file) play really high-pitched and fast, but I think that's a problem with GBS emulators playing DAC.

<br />
<br />The current "NEZPlug" is a broken piece of crap compared to the improved NEZPlug++. It's worth having to install a C++ library to make it work.
<br />
<br />GBS2GB makes darn good decisions on it's own a vast majority of the time. All that generally needs to be done is to choose the file, and have it converted to a .GB file. It makes more decisions than Scott Worley's gbsplay.asm file, because it reads the required info out of the GBS, and tells you if a game is incompatible with the default settings. I use it primarily for debugging GBS files in BGB. I work on it whenever I see a problem, but the total count on real problems the coding has had is about 2, one with the EI/HALT instructions, another with Timer+VBlank emulation. Overall, you're not likely to do much better for 0x400 bytes of code.
<br />
<br />I don't use other GBS players because NEZPlug is the one being updated to work right at the moment. BGB seems to be a great music playing emulator, as well as having a debugger, so that's not something that'll be leaving my arsenal for a while.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Thanks for the link.  The included player became unresponsive after I had played a few songs, but the Winamp plugin seems to work fine, albeit the little popping noise when changing tracks.  Pokemon Yellow sounds great now.  The problem must be in out-dated players.  
<br />
<br />Now I need to find a good way to do some Diskwriting so I can create some "Highest Quality" Pokemon soundtrack CDs.  EPIC.  It's such a pain that most video game ripped music formats lump all the songs together, resulting in one huge WAV file.  Foobar was nice because it separated the songs, but the plugin was inaccurate.  I could try using GBS2GB like you suggest and record the music from the resulting rom in BGB, but that would take FOREVER.  
<br />
<br />Another issue is having to set the playing time limit.  I'll have to go back and edit out all the extra data for each song.  That will take FOREVER.  Meh, I guess it's the price one has to pay for awesomeness.  
<br />
<br />Which is more accurate, NEZPlug or BGB?
<br />
<br />Completely off-topic, but what's the most accurate NSF player?  Notso Fatso's stereo enhancement sounds great, but if I want raw accuracy, what's the best choice?  I've been using Nestopia's NSF player.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Winamp has a diskwriter plugin that should allow you to easily get a clean start to a song by starting it, changing tracks, stopping it, and then choosing the next song.
<br />
<br />BGB has a WAV File Writer, but you're likely better off learning how to edit the start address of music if you want to use it, then reloading the game(or you can use GG codes to edit it in the GBS header data)
<br />
<br />As for accuracy, that's just plain hard to judge. The only actual GB I had access to is long dead, and it would be hard to determine it's accuracy even if I had a good one, because the GB doesn't have the best sound system.
<br />
<br />For NSFs, I use NotSoFatso. (and have NSF support in NEZPlug disabled)
<br />
<br />The problem with NSF support is that if you want accurate sounding NSFs, about the only place you'll get close is with a FCEU(XD)(SP) variation. No winamp plugin has accurate 4017 support at the moment. This is very annoying, but I can't fix it, because I just plain don't know how.

All these programs that we've talked about sound pretty darn close to that.   <img src="./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" />
<br />
<br />Game Music Emu is pretty good... I think, but foo_gep is based off of it and Foobar has issues with the Noise channel in Pokemon Yellow.  Also, isn't Game Music Emu bandlimited?  (aka kinda muffled)
<br />
<br />Winamp has crapped out on me... The "associated file types" was over the 260-ish limit in Windows XP, so for the longest time the Open dialogue wouldn't show any files unless I chose "All files" waaaaaay down at the bottom of the scroll menu.  I tried removing a bunch of unnecessary file type associations, and for some unknown reason, Winamp now crashes each time I try to run it.
<br />
<br />EDIT: The problem was in_cube.dll.  Apparently Windows XP only supports 200 characters worth of file type extensions to show up in "All supported file types."  That plugin supports about one million different extensions.  Sheesh.

<br />BGB sounds kind of weird compared to no$gmb sometimes. I haven't tested which sounds most like an actual Gameboy though, but Martin (the no$ guy) usually knows what he's doing.

<br />I haven't had good experiences with VisualBoyAdvance.  While using DirectDraw and Vsync in GB mode, for one, the quality doesn't seem very good (it's not SMOOTH,) and every so often the sound glitches, is scratchy, desyncs, and then fixes itself.  It's painful.
<br />
<br />VBA's GBA mode audio seems alright, or at least as good as Highly Advanced Winamp plugin...?
<br />
<br />I love BGB, except I can't get it to achieve a perfect Vsync without any horizontal tearing.  There's always one line of tearing in the top fourth of the screen.  If it wasn't for that, it would be perfect!  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" alt=":(" title="Sad" /> 
<br />
<br />BGB's audio is sexy.
<br />
<br />
<br />Thanks BMF54123 for in_nintendulator.dll!  I might end up using that now.  How does Nestopia rank?

<br />My PC has an ATI Radeon 9000 card, and I always get tearing. In fact, I made an OpenGL program with wglSwapIntervalEXT(1) that had rock-solid tearing near the top of the screen. By now, I'm convinced it's a problem with the card or its driver.
