Did you recompile it under a big endian system ?</div><br />That's exactly what I tried to do. My main computer is an iMac G5, and it uses a PowerPC processor, so it is a big endian system. Right off the bat, I determined endianness was responsible for the wrong sample address being loaded, as I was getting glitched results. I didn't have this problem with the Java version (however, I don't have the latest Java version)... after recompiling because I was running an earlier version of Java.<br /><br />Part of the reason I'm interested in the SNES is that I can pull off some features the NES can't. Especially Mode 7. And if I wanted to add some modifications (or just make a brand new one), I can use pitch modulation (this one is rarely used, although I know of a few examples, and I've been using it myself recently via a modifed version of SNESMod) and noise generation.

What tepples said about licensing samples sounds plausible too.<br />I don't think you can use samples ripped straight from Nintendo games even if you do own the unit those samples originated from since Nintendo must've converted the samples to brr and likely processed them too.<br />Making your own samples for the snes isn't hard anyway, I'll try to make a tutorial at some point.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">tepples wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">Except at the start of vblank, which bites you if your NMI handler didn't have much to copy this frame and you immediately start to run your next frame's game logic.

Unfortunately I don't have a big endian machine to test on it, but I'll have to find a way to fix it somehow, so you can use the new BRRTools on your machine. I imagine I'd need a wrapper routine for every fread/fwrite call so that the byte order is reversed on big endian machines.<br /><br />As for Java, I don't think the version of Java has any impact on the functionality of the program. The Java version is no longer supported, because, well, Java was starting to really annoy me. Compiling and running program is so complicated and it's so inefficient at runtime, it's a huge price to pay for the cross-platform compatibility.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">I like it how there's always someone bashing wla in every thread on this sub. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt=":roll:" title="Rolling Eyes" /> </div><br />I'm not bashing it, I just said that i had problems with the SPC700 version.

I have several sound fonts lying on my PC (most of them were available for free, some came with an old sound card) and 2 synthesizers, so I'd have a very large source of samples not ripped from games anways.

In the manual for my old synthesizer, I think I remember finding an explicit licensing clause allowing the use of the samples for commercial products without separate royalties, and AIUI something equivalent is very common in the EULA of most commercial softsynths (You're buying a royalty-free license, not just the software). Conversely, this is part of why CreativeCommons-Sampling license was formed, because this surface wasn't explicitly clear in legal code nor in case law.

The most unusual implementation of pitch modulation by far for music is Packy and Marlon.<br /><br />I myself use soundfonts (at least in part) for the music, although I edit them manually so that they can be transformed into SNES samples. It's less painful for me to edit those than fooling around with samples already made for the SNES (especially when ripped from .spc files... those loop points are already perfected, and sometimes they have no room for further adjustments) However, I have caught on to what sample packs are used by what companies, and some of them are really unique (Rap Jam: Volume One comes to mind... or even Universal Soldier!). So be careful what you pick... I can recognize a bunch of them, especially the ones that sound much more unique. It helps that I've invented music modifiers for at least a hundred SNES games.  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" />

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I will try and allow for nice things like an IPC layer for talking to the debugger (so you could have your own GUI-based tools on top of it), a user-made command alias so you can short-hand anything you want (the defaults are going to be verbose instead of single-letter commands), command history, execute-last-command quickly, a codebase that makes it easy to add your own monitoring windows to it, etc.<br /><br />Appreciative that some of you won't mind the text-based interface, but I do fully expect it to be much less popular than the traditional GUI style, and that's fine. Like with higan, I make my stuff for me now, and I understand that it's niche. It is, however, sadly the only choice for a Linux SNES debugger. ZSNES' is DOS only (and discontinued), Geiger and no$sns are both Windows only. (DOSbox and Wine are hard enough, let alone on a 64-bit system with no ia32libs.)<br /><br />I've always personally felt that the absolute most powerful debugger is the one where you are writing code right into the emulator itself. No debugger, GUI or text-based, is going to allow you the power to eg set a breakpoint when pixel 216,37 is set to BG3 when the screen is in mode 0. Or a breakpoint that breaks after the 37th hit while A=0x0153 after reset. But that's a five-second breakpoint to setup when you're working with the C++ code directly.

Simple <tt style="margin-left: 2px; margin-right: 2px; padding:3px; background-color: #3355aa; color: white;">rep/sep</tt> following takes care of 90% usage cases; other scenarios are exactly why assemblers have pseudo-ops to tell the assembler how it should be treating register sizes within that piece of code, making it the programmers' responsibility to know what is going on (and I fully agree with this belief).  Nothing pisses me off more than computers (e.g. assemblers/compilers) thinking they can make decisions on my behalf.  My mistakes = my fault, my program = my responsibility.<br /><br />I'll end with a verbatim quote from the ORCA/M manual, with relevant part bolded:<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">The 65816 CPU is capable of doing sixteen-bit operations involving the accumulator and memory; it is also capable of performing eight-bit operations the same way the 6502 and 65C02 do. The size of the accumulator and the amount of memory affected by instructions like LDA, STA and INC are controlled by a bit in the processor status register. <strong>At assembly time, the assembler has no idea how that bit will be set at run time – it is the responsibility of the programmer to tell the assembler using this directive.</strong></div>

They are also useful for 16-bit increment/decrement. This covers most needs. You pretty much have to keep an 8-bit register around to deal with hardware registers. Use 16-bit A/8-bit X and Y where it makes a significant speed difference, and be wary of any routine calls while in this mode.

That means basically all I/O registers, most of your variables (since 8-bit is enough for almost everything), most tables in memory. It's a pretty obvious choice if you're coding for the SNES.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Some of the memory-mapped registers are 8-bit, others are 16-bit.  The reality of programming on the SNES/SFC specifically is that you do end up using <tt style="margin-left: 2px; margin-right: 2px; padding:3px; background-color: #3355aa; color: white;">sep/rep</tt> a lot, which really isn't that big of a deal since they only take 3 cycles.  When it comes to memory-mapped registers, depending on what was desired by the programmer, folks tended to do things in &quot;sections&quot;, i.e. <tt style="margin-left: 2px; margin-right: 2px; padding:3px; background-color: #3355aa; color: white;">rep #$30</tt> then do necessary 16-bit stuff, then <tt style="margin-left: 2px; margin-right: 2px; padding:3px; background-color: #3355aa; color: white;">sep #$20</tt> (8-bit a, 16-bit x/y) and do necessary 8-bit stuff there.  I'm going to bow out of this subject from here on out, as it's starting to get into sperglordland.  :-)<br /><br />It just pisses me off when I see people crying/whining over this shit.  The 65816 was designed to be backwards-compatible with the 65c02, which means 256 opcodes, and having dynamically-sized registers (thus applies to some operands, which is what the is complaint is about) means you only need 2 opcodes to control that (unless you wanted to rely entirely on <tt style="margin-left: 2px; margin-right: 2px; padding:3px; background-color: #3355aa; color: white;">plp</tt>, ha) while giving you the benefits of 16-bit registers.  The crying is often done by people who did 68K or were spoiled by processors which had 16 bits worth of opcode space (i.e. 2-byte opcodes) -- sure, that might make things &quot;easier for you&quot; (and anyone disassembling), but that would mandate a new CPU that wasn't backwards-compatible with the 65c02.  Reality check!
