That justifies, for example, the difference between trainers' inflated heads in overhead parts of <em>Pokémon</em> and their less-exaggerated proportions in battle.<br /><br />But that doesn't apply so much here. This sprite is tall but still has a head-to-neck ratio that looks like whiplash-bait.

Yes, for the reason you mentioned, but no, it's not just about a small number of pixels. A cartoon-styled character having an oversized is head is completely normal.<br /><br />Exhibit 1: Charlie Brown, from 1950.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Yeah, that's kind of a left-field observation that comes off more as a thinly veiled complaint against any kind of SD / chibi /  anime art-style, not to mention its presence in modern Western cartooning, such as Dexter's Laboratory or whatever.<br /><br />Anyway, I think it's a neat project with impressive visuals. Considering it's being distributed freely online as some type of promotional mini-game for a non-FC project, the feasibility of these tehniques being expanded into a &quot;full game&quot; is a non-issue. It's rad to see such large, fluidly animated sprites on the system.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Yeah the SD-style is as popular as ever. I do believe one benefit of the style is to show face expressions in low resolutions, but the fact that it's still used in modern games and other media where this isn't relevant shows that that's hardly a deciding factor. It's a fact that the style is considered cute and popular.<br />Besides this game is a promotion of a 3DS game (<a href="http://www.ancient.co.jp/~game/mamotte_knight2/" class="postlink">Minna de Mamotte Knight 2</a>, check out that manga where &quot;Famikid Mamoru&quot; analyses the game code) that's using SD-style character design and retro-style graphics.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">FrankenGraphics wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">Maybe i'm just terribly bad at this sort of game, but what good is the kick, double kick and back flip? Everytime i try to kick a 'bad' item, i seem to collect it instead. <br /><br />But the wall of cupcakes at level 5 must be destroyed somehow....</div>I think the kick moves are just to avoid cupcake panels. I use it to simulate a double jump to stay in the air longer. I found no way to avoid that cupcake wall completely, I just slide through it to minimize cake consumption and as long as your liquid level isn't low it's usually no problem.

</blockquote><br /><br />So anyway, to get on Nintendo 3DS eShop, you first need to have completed a PC game of some sort so that you have enough confidence and experience to make best use of the devkit Nintendo offers to sell you. Then you can register through <a href="https://developer.nintendo.com/" class="postlink">developer.nintendo.com (formerly WarioWorld)</a>. But I've read somewhere that Nintendo Switch devkits are reserved for those with successful Nintendo 3DS games.
