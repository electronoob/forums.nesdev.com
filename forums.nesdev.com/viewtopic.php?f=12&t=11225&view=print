		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Hey I am working to try and understand SPC programming. I'm working on an example taking a sample at one frequency and then using it to create a diatonic scale (ie &quot;do re mi&quot;).<br /><br />I understand all the .BRR playback stuff, but I am confused about the conversion of desired pitch in Hz to a 14-bit hex value.<br /><br />The Snes Dev Manual <a href="http://www.romhacking.net/documents/226/" class="postlink">http://www.romhacking.net/documents/226/</a> specifies this:<br /><br />f = f0 * (P/2^12)<br /><br />Where P pitch value for the SNES. f is &quot;the frequency of the reproduced sound&quot; and f0 is the &quot;frequency of the original sound (sound at the time of recording)&quot;<br /><br /><br />while the SPC700 reference <a href="http://wiki.superfamicom.org/snes/show/SPC700+Reference" class="postlink">http://wiki.superfamicom.org/snes/show/SPC700+Reference</a> says this:<br />                      <br />HZ = 32000 * (P/2^12)<br /><br /><br />My understanding from the SNES Dev Manual is that f0 is the actual frequency of the note (ie 440Hz for A), but the sfc wiki implies this is the sample rate. <br /><br />I am at work so I can't test it out right now. Just curious if anyone knows offhand, and subsequently if the sfc wiki is incorrect.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />ha, duh.  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_redface.gif" alt=":oops:" title="Embarassed" /> that makes total sense. Thanks for the clarification.<br /><br />I understand you are talking about the relationship of samplerate to pitch but where as I can see the direct benefit of knowing the frequency (ie getting the pitch of a sample), why would you want to know the samplerate of a <em>re-pitched </em>sample? The only thing I can think of is maybe if there is a noise in the sample that is too high to be audible but could be heard at a lower samplerate

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I am asking from the perspective of needing to know the Pitch value &quot;p&quot; that has to go into the DSP. <br />If you know the original pitch (assuming you recorded/created the sample) and the desired pitch in Hz which seems like it would be easier to find out, you'd have all you need to get the Pitch value to go into the DSP right? I'm confused about where or how you would need to know the new samplerate. <br /><br />Let me know if I'm misunderstanding.

It compiles with wla-65816 and the sound code compiles with TASM. I have included the TAB file because it seems like some versions of the table I've found do not work for me)
