Motzilla you are probably right if it runs all commercial games there is probably not much to be worried about, as as a whole they have all kind of weird behavior we can immagine (giving headaches to emu authors).<br /><br />However, I was thinking about <a href="http://nesdev.com/bbs/viewtopic.php?t=5468" class="postlink">that</a> edge case in particular. I wrote a demo that relies on very precise CHR switching timing, I don't know how much I can trust emulators and power pak, that's why it'd always great to have a true SKROM devcard.<br /><br />And BTW I should definitely get a power pak soon (I was waiting for a verison with MMC5 support but now it seems I'd just wait forever).<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=38">Bregalad</a> — Sun Aug 09, 2009 2:01 pm</p><hr />

I think the sticking point is that we don't know the entire behavior of the authentic Nintendo MMC3, so the authentic chip and homebrew implementations (e.g. PowerPak MMC3 and emulated MMC3) may differ in behavior in some configurations (e.g. write sequences or display register configurations) that no commercial game uses. They don't use these configurations because either they just happen not to do anything useful on an authentic MMC3 or Nintendo may have actually banned them in "lot check" (its compatibility and UI certification process). The <a href="http://nesdev.com/bbs/viewtopic.php?p=47787#47787" class="postlink">recently discovered misbehavior in some chip revisions if not all MMC3 registers are initialized</a> is an example.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=9">tepples</a> — Sun Aug 09, 2009 1:50 pm</p><hr />

I think you're worried about something that wouldn't really be a big issue.<br /><br />I don't see any reason why you couldn't make a MMC3 game with PowerPAK &amp; Emulators. If it's good enough to run all these commercial games I don't see how it could be so bad. Maybe the timing isn't perfect but it's close enough for most games. I really can't think of any games that don't work other than the obvious ones without mapper support yet.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=1726">MottZilla</a> — Sun Aug 09, 2009 1:30 pm</p><hr />

That's what I meant - when developping a MMC1 games that would do something like mid-scanline CHR bankswitching (I may be planning to do that), I'd be afraid that the Power Pak switches a few cycles too early or too late as opposed to a real MMC1, which maintains full compatibility with 99.9 % of MMC1 games.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=38">Bregalad</a> — Sun Aug 09, 2009 12:19 pm</p><hr />

Yeah, I have heard of MMC3 issues with the powerpak.

For cartridges games I think it really doesn't matter if it's good or used (as long as it has been used under normal conditions of courses), because it hardly get any type of significant damage. For disk I agree it's better new because when you use a disc, even the most correctly, it still becomes dirty.

It depends on the mean of handling it.  I don't really buy duplicates just for the fun of it and to reduce them from the one available on the market  like the post you mentioned if my memory is good. I read that thread long time ago so I hope I'm not mixing things up!   I just bought a few recently but on purpose: extra dev carts when the price was very, very low. Who would skip a 2$ FF3 or 1$ Madara, even with very dirty adaptor?<br /><br />The nes is maybe the only one that I bought more games than usual since it was the one I liked the most.  I should have never sold my US games, that would have save me time and money I guess <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" /> <br /><br />Sometime I bought game that I would almost not play because the price was low (0.50$ or 1$) because I don't mind to do that for that platform. But now I try to stick to the one I liked, less junk for nothing.  Now my only problem is some games never came to japan (that's feel odd to say that since usually it was the opposite in the past!) even thought they were made here (Kick master, low g man etc).  I may buy them again if I can find them cheap. It's rare that I want to put a lot of money on a old game, unless I really want it but I hate that.  <br /><br />For example, I found some megadrive (genesis) games at 2$/3$. One of them was YuYu hakusho. I thought it was the RPG and was "well, I like the TV series so why not". When I arrived home, it was actually the fighting game which is worth a lot more than that.  That was a happy find. After playing the game... I would have never paid the price some store ask, never. Why pay 70$/100$... That's crazy.  The best thing to wait, you never know when you can find it cheaper.  And now that auction at 3000$.... That's utter craziness for the current state of the lot.  I'm a gamer and would never pay that much. Even if I was a collector, the state is not good enough to worth that price. Ebay is where people pay too much for things that worth nothing. That's why I never use it.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3559">Banshaku</a> — Sat Aug 08, 2009 7:55 pm</p><hr />
