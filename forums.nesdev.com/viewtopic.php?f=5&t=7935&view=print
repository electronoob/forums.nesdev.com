		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />i know this is a NES emu/homebrew site, but this is still emulation related and i know most people here might be interested. some of you might know of this already if you go to #nesdev on efnet, but thought i'd post a thread here.
<br />
<br />this is something i started working on back in nov. 2010 or so, an x86 PC emu (compatible up to the 80186/V20 so far) written in C. i call it Fake86. forgive the spam but if anybody is interested in checking it out or even helping development here's the home page - <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://fake86.rubbermallet.org">http://fake86.rubbermallet.org</a><!-- m -->
<br />
<br />major features so far:
<br />-100% of 8086 instructions emulated, and all 80186 instructions except for the string port I/O stuff
<br />-CGA/VGA/Hercules video emulation
<br />-preliminary Adlib music card emulation (not accurate, and doesnt support percussion yet)
<br />-disney sound source emulation
<br />-can use floppy/hard drive image files
<br />-preliminary ethernet emulation (with a customized DOS packet driver)
<br />
<br />if you have a look i'd love to hear opinions/suggestions/flames, and like i said above i'm open to other devs joining the project. it's been just myself so far.
<br />
<br />here's a video of it playing Wolfenstein 3D i uploaded today, it gives a good idea of where the emu is at:
<br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIgcIgz-EQ4">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIgcIgz-EQ4</a><!-- m -->
<br />
<br />the audio sounds a bit odd, i don't have much experience with real-time audio generation. i'm learning as i go. probably timing issues.
<br />
<br />i'm trying to keep it very portable btw, so far i've gotten it working on windows, linux, bsd, and OS X (both on powerpc and intel macs)

<br />
<br />it should run those just fine, and it is compatible with TSRs. installing TSRs are handled by the DOS API, so whether or not they work doesn't actually have anything to do with how i write the emulator.
<br />
<br />unlike DOSBox, Fake86 doesn't have DOS built into it.. it boots DOS or any other OS from a hard drive or floppy image file the same way QEMU does. it could run for example, Xenix86, MINIX 1/2, or CP/M-86 instead of DOS. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />
<br />
<br />not sure what you mean by CHR/graphics/VRAM/palette viewer though, there is no equivalent of the NES CHR-ROM in a PC video card unless you're referring to the font tables used in text modes?

<br />
<br />thanks.. multi-threading the CPU would have caused issues with interrupt timing, until just about 20 minutes ago... i just added proper emulation of the i8259 interrupt controller.
<br />
<br />(about to get uber-technical here...)
<br />before i was just directly calling interrupts when events happened like keyboard input, system timer tick, or ethernet packets received. if the CPU was in a different thread than the one that generated the "hardware" interrupt calls, it would have caused a nasty crash since the CPU would most likely be in the middle of running an instruction when i pushed the flags/CS/IP registers and changed the CS:IP to the ISR.
<br />
<br />now it would be okay since the CPU emu code checks for pending interrupts right before starting a new instruction, and calls the ISR if needed at that point.
<br />
<br />back to the point though, i don't think multithreading it would help with speed accuracy much if at all. i currently have absolutely no provisions for keeping track of exactly cycles based on instructions that run, but i will probably add it at some point. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />

<br />
<br />yeah that makes sense, that would be cool but really tricky too. EGA modes and planar VGA modes are insanely complicated. i'm not really writing this to be specifically for games anyway, more of just a general PC emu for anything.

<br />
<br />yeah exactly what i was talking about in my post up there. the new interrupt controller emulation fixes this. it has definitely fixed the frequent hangs that i got when trying to use the ethernet emulation, so it appears to be working.

<br />Image-only support is not my thing, so it can be nicer than the other DOS emulators, and do not have to buy some expensive utility to help make images such as WinImage/ISOMagic!

<br />
<br />i would like to add at least 386 protected mode support eventually, but i started with just 8086/80186 as the goal because this is the first time i've written any CPU emulation core. now that i understand it all better i think it won't be too bad to go back and add 32-bit support. i wrote a NES emulator that worked fairly well last year, but the actual 6502 core was Neil Bradley's, i just coded the rest around that.
<br />
<br />after i get the rest of the PC support architecture completed, i'll go back and go for 386. i just finally added proper Intel 8259 code today. next up is the DMA controller, and that should pretty much do it. that's not even strictly necessary, several lower-end x86 computers didn't even have DMA (like some of the Tandy 1000-series and the PCjr) but i want to add it anyway. oh and i have to work on EGA support too.
<br />
<br />i really like the plugin idea actually, i'll think a bit about a good way to implement it. a decent plugin system will be a bit tricky to pull off.
<br />
<br />and, no i don't consider this to be any kind of competition for Bochs, but it's not necessarily just for old games. more like just old software in general.
<br />
<br />the BIOS i actually grabbed from <!-- w --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.phatcode.net">www.phatcode.net</a><!-- w --> (with source code) -- it was a dump of some generic taiwanese XT clone BIOS somebody made back in the late 80's, then disassembled and commented it/made tweaks, and then a few years ago the phatcode.net guy did some more tweaking. so, it's legality is kind of a grey area, but i'm not worried it's so old and i doubt the company even exists now.  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" />
<br />
<br />there are a few things the emulator intercepts rather than letting the BIOS handle, like int 13h (disk services) and int 19h (bootstrap)
<br />
<br />EDIT: direct link to that XT BIOS' home page -- <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.phatcode.net/downloads.php?id=101">http://www.phatcode.net/downloads.php?id=101</a><!-- m -->
