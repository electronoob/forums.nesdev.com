It seems pretty rare, I've never seen a cartridge of it in person.  I do remember years ago seeing collectors pay craploads for sealed copies of it though (pretty weird box size too, since it has all the needed accessories).<br /><br />Not surprising it's so rare, it had to be purchased separately. My first NES came with R.O.B. and Gyromite, and if I had known Stack-Up was available I'm sure I would not have gotten it. <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" /><p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=10">Memblers</a> — Mon May 17, 2010 3:08 pm</p><hr />

I was under the impression that the reason some carts housed the internal Famicom -&gt; NES adaptor is because the JP versions were overproduced and it was cheaper to build adaptors than build completely new boards. And subsequently, I thought the JP and US versions had to be the exact same game.<br /><br />Taking a look at the NSF, however (found <a href="http://nsf.hcs64.com/g/" class="postlink">here</a> and <a href="http://akumunsf.good-evil.net/dir.php?dir=G" class="postlink">here</a>), I hear jingles I don't recognize, and I can't find the main stage theme. Is the US version unripped? Or are the games actually the same and the nsf is simply incomplete?<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=1096">bucky o'hare</a> — Thu May 13, 2010 12:38 pm</p><hr />
