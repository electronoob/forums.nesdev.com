I'm currently at level 10 of 20, and I find myself eating food each time I get into a battle. I've got the first bar of some of the music stuck in my head due to a screen switching trick. Gameplay wise, this is a better RTS then Overlord/Supremacy for the NES (but Overlord still has one of the best title screen music).<br /><br />I do find the frequent random nameable and palette corruption to be slightly annoying but usually correctable.<br /><br />Once I get to the last level, I'm thinking I might do a NES homebrew marathon on Twitch TV for a week or something. Including a play through of the last level of Armed for Battle.<br /><br />So a question: I read in the manual that you can build storage buildings but I have yet to see such a thing. Is that later in the game, or a feature that got cut?

As far as the Storage Buildings, yes, they were cut, and then replaced with the Scholar Temple.  The gameplay/fun did not seem to benefit at all by the use of the Storage Building, and so I came up with the Scholar Temple which did have benefits in the strategizing aspect.  I discovered just a little too late that a mention of the storage buildings was still in the manual (it was removed in the key places of the manual).  I had a blog entry back on <a href="http://1010howe.blogspot.com/search?updated-max=2014-03-08T16:14:00-06:00&amp;max-results=7&amp;start=7&amp;by-date=false" class="postlink">02-27-14</a> that bid farewell to the storage buildings.  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />

I don't know if you've already discovered this bug but during the battle scene when I got down to about 4 guys on the battle field with my army depleted they were frozen in the first column of the battlefield and wouldn't attack any enemies and the enemies wouldn't attack them. Nonetheless keep up the good work!

It's been a while, but I am thinking this was a rare occurrence on the demo (or at least I haven't gotten much feedback about this).
