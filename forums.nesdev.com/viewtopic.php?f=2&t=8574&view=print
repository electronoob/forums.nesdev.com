<br />Not without redoing the Nintendo's Internals entirely
<br />
<br />There is Doctor PC Junior, or you can make your own NES-compatible FPGA Computer capable of using storage (I may look into making a minimal 6502 DOS in the future)

<br />
<br />Well, not exactly an OS, but BIOS in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Famicom#Famicom_Disk_system" class="postlink">Famicom Disk System</a> device. It only handles the disk operations and verify errors. There are no options or customization available. 
<br />
<br />The Famicom itself has nothing.

<br />I know that Windows 2000 was "ported" to the FC and shipped with keyboard based clones.

<br />EDIT: Data is saved through the Family BASIC keyboard onto the data cassette recorder, not directly through the expansion port. My bad.

Groepaz also made the NES library for CC65 but the problem was it was only tested with the (inaccurate) emulators available at the time.  If someone was to rewrite the conio library (and whatever else is needed), it would probably be usable.
<br />
<br />I don't know if there were any applications for it other than the internet ones, and of course there wasn't a network adapter so it was pretty much a dead end.  At the time, I looked into getting it work with an RS232 adapter, but between getting that to work (indirectly through a PC), and fixing the CC65 libraries (when I didn't even know C), I had no idea how to proceed.

<br />Perhaps all that means is that he had things to do with a higher priority than finding and fixing bugs in his FAT driver. At least that's what I gather from bunnyboy's "doing all the FAT searching and cluster allocation was too much at the time." I seem to remember the Doctor PC Jr. having a basic FAT12 driver for its floppy drive, and as I understand it, FAT16 and FAT32 are easier because you don't have cluster numbers split across sectors.

<br />A scan of the free list sounds like something that could be done in the background whenever the main program has nothing better to do. On a FAT16 volume, the FAT is no bigger than 256 sectors (256 clusters per FAT sector, 64K clusters per volume), though it's a lot bigger on a FAT32 volume (128 clusters per FAT sector, 1 to 8 million clusters per volume). And does the scan have to be linear instead of pseudorandom?
