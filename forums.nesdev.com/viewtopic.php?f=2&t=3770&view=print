		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />When I move a sprite partially off the top or left of the screen in emulators (I can't see the behavior on a real NES with my TV), after a few pixels it clips the sprite. Why is this and how can I prevent it? This logic isn't implemented in my emulator, but if it's really how it works I'd like to put it in and well, understand it.
<br />
<br />Also are we sure that Nintendulator has a perfect renderer? I ask because my PowerPak is having problems with a little test ROM I wrote to test my TV's safe area while emulators are not. I also don't think this has anything to do with the hardware since sprite DMA in games seems to work fine and I can't imagine where the PowerPak's initialization would break my code.
<br />
<br />Anyone mind looking at my program? I suppose there's something I could be overlooking but it's pretty straight forward.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I believe your sprite clipping is due to the fact that it wraps around to be at Y Coordinate $FF, it's going to a pixel that is not displayed, since the screen is only $F0 pixels tall. Once it reaches $EF, you'll be able to see it. This may be total garbage, but this is how I think it works. Say your sprite is at coordinates $FF. At Scanline $FF (Off screen), the game will try to render the sprite. The rest of the sprite should be on the top of the screen, but the NES already rendered stuff up there, and by the time it gets back to the top of the screen, it forgets that there was a sprite at $FF. I'm not certain, but that might be it.
<br />
<br />In Nintendulator, It seems that if you put a sprite at coordinates 0,0, it's not exactly in the corner of the screen. It will appear to be at pixel 0,1. I don't know why this is, but I had to mention it while I'm here.
<br />
<br />EDIT: You should get a freewebs account if you want a place to store stuff that people can download. It's of course, free, and doesn't require the waiting.

<br />
<br />So yeah, according to NESdev wiki, sprites do not wrap around if they are in positions $F9-$FF. If your sprite is at $00, and you move left one pixel, it'll be at $FF, so it will jump to the other side of the screen. Since there are no wrap arounds, the rest of your sprite will not be visible. That is also the case for Y coords.
<br />
<br />There aren't many ways to prevent this. If you want, you can use the sprite clipping so it won't be visible in the left column of the screen. For vertical movement, it's not that big of a deal if you're using an NTSC system, since the top two bars are cut off. I'd use sprite clipping, because the sudden disappearing is ugly.
<br />
<br />I looked over your code, and I noticed some things that looked like they may cause some sorts of problems. Not anything too big though.
<br />
<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">&nbsp; &nbsp;lda sprite_y<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;clc<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;sbc #1&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;; compensate for ppu<br /></div><br /><br />Is there any reason for clearing the carry? Maybe there is, but this could be a typo. Just wanted to point it out.<br /><br />And I see you do this:<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent"><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;lda #0<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;ldx #$ff<br />-&nbsp; &nbsp;sta $200, x<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;dex<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;bne -&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;; clear sprite page<br /></div><br /><br />You know you can just load X with $00 and it will clear everything? If you do "ldx #$FF" for the loop, it'll just clear everything but the last byte.<br /><br />EDIT: I also don't think you're clearing the Sprite_X or Sprite_Y values before using them. That could be a problem. You'd do well to clear all of RAM with this simple loop:<br /><br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">&nbsp;lda #0<br />&nbsp;tax<br />-<br />&nbsp;sta $0,x<br />&nbsp;sta $100,x<br />&nbsp;sta $200,x<br />&nbsp;sta $300,x<br />&nbsp;sta $400,x<br />&nbsp;sta $500,x<br />&nbsp;sta $600,x<br />&nbsp;sta $700,x<br />&nbsp;inx<br />&nbsp;bne -<br /></div>
<br />
<br />I'm pretty sure the NES has random values in RAM on reset. Counting on them being #$00 is not a good thing to do.

<br />Really it doesn't matter what the variables are initialized to, it will just make the sprites appear somewhere else, no biggie.
<br />

<br />Celius is right. Your code will fail to clear $200, it will only clear $201-$2FF. When X reaches 0, the branch is not taken, so the value at $200 will not be cleared. By initializing X with 0, you take care of that location right on the first write.
<br />
<br />Back to the topic, there is no way to smoothly scroll sprites from/to the top or from/to the left of the screen and still see the whole background, this is a limition of the NES. The NES has an option to not render the leftmost 8 pixels, and by using that the sprites can scroll smoothly from/to the left of the screen. To have them scroll smoothly from/to the top, you may keep rendering disabled for a few scanlines after the end of VBlank, achieving a similar effect.
<br />
<br />I don't think you should be to worried about this. Most TV's cut the parts of the image affected by this glitch. And almost all commercial games have that effect, and no one has complained until now.

<br />Clipping to the top and left would require the PPU's registers to be able to represent negative coordinates. The Super NES PPU can do this; the NES PPU cannot.

<br />In fact to be correct this code just have to be the other way arround : lda #$ff and ldx #$00 so that it will clear all bytes, and <strong>SRAM has to be cleared with any value in the $f0-$ff range, NOT $00 to be effectively cleared !</strong>
<br />
<br />When it comes to scroll smoothly horizontally the only solution is to use hardware clipping, as someone already mentionned. That's most likely why this feature is existing at all. In function of your game engine and scrolling workings, you'll want this area to be clipped or not (most games either always clips it or never clips it). Also you cannot rely to the leftmost&amp;rightmost 8 pixels to be rendered as far I've heard some monitors will hide this. If you use leftmost hardware clipping, a X coordinate of zero will completely hide the sprite and it will have no effect at all (exept to be counted in the 8 sprites per line limitation).
<br />
<br />When it comes to scroll smoothly vertically it's not too hard as most monitors and emulators will hide the topmost and bottommost 8 pixels, so this is just enough to scroll smoothly. If you want to do PAL coding or if you are using 8x16 sprites, this isn't true any longer. In both cases, leaving the rendering off ala Battletoads would be one solution, however scrolling becomes a pain in the ass.
<br />What you can do is abuse the 8 sprites per line limitation and place 8 top-priorities sprites at Y coordinate 0. Then you just have to turn the BG (and BG only, not sprites) off via $2001 in order to get a black background on the top of invisible sprites, effectively blanking the area. You'd want to enable BG back at either scanline #9 (PAL) or scanliine #17 (8x16 sprites) for completely smooth movement. I guess the scrolling will be right because the sprites were left enabled technically. It that's not the case, you may consider bankwitching an all-blank CHRROM page for the top scanlines, ending with a similar effect.
