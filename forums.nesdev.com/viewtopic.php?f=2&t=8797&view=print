<br />Extra:Minimum supported WRAM? Mine is 32KB. 128KB would be very nice, though.

<br />I would really like if we could all think outside of the realm of licensed games, and consider what we could achieve if we had some more memory. Smooth animations, animated patterns, fake parallax, huge worlds... these would benefit greatly from some extra memory, but a decent mapper to manage that memory would be crucial.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Is the primary goal to play every rom you can find on the net or to for homebrew development?  In my opinion there is a lot more room for improvement besides merely allowing for more memory.  It's easy (but expensive) to slap on more/larger SRAM.  You could save money by going with flash but then have the downside of programability and write cycle limit.  If memory is such an issue the best solution I see is to add an SD card on the cheap.  There isn't much value in having 2MB of addressable memory on a devcart IMO.
<br />
<br />I think just having a few KB of dual ported memory would be a lot more powerful than having an unlimited amount of memory.  Having a more powerful mapper would be a better advantage than more memory as I see it.

<br />Unless you're trying to prototype a multicart that's that big.

For WRAM it's 256Kbits since it's the last DIP28, and 1M will give you as much RAM as a SNES game. Unless you're "backporting" a SNES game you can probably work without it.

<br />Why? Just select which game you want and load it into memory. In that aspect the power pak is effectively one big customizable multicart.

<br />I understand that. But why were <a href="http://bootgod.dyndns.org:7777/profile.php?id=525" class="postlink">Short Order and Eggsplode</a> sold on one cart? Why were <a href="http://bootgod.dyndns.org:7777/profile.php?id=958" class="postlink">three games based on the Hebrew Scriptures</a> sold on one cart? Likewise with <a href="http://bootgod.dyndns.org:7777/profile.php?id=364" class="postlink">its sequel</a>? Why was Dr. Mario sold <a href="http://www.mariowiki.com/Tetris_%26_Dr._Mario" class="postlink">along with Tetris</a> on Super NES and <a href="http://www.mariowiki.com/Dr._Mario_%26_Puzzle_League" class="postlink">along with the game formerly known as Tetris Attack</a> on GBA? And for cricket's sake, why did Nintendo pull out all the stops and put <a href="http://www.mariowiki.com/WarioWare,_Inc.:_Minigame_Mania" class="postlink">200+ games on one Game Pak</a>?
<br />
<br />What I'm trying to do is put together a single cartridge that collects the NES homebrew community's best efforts to demonstrate once and for all that even unpaid volunteers can outcode Active Enterprises. I can get up to about 20 games in one 512 KiB collection on the PowerPak, but I have a numerological reason why I'm <a href="http://nesdev.com/bbs/viewtopic.php?t=8514" class="postlink">aiming for 53</a>. Think of it as like Memblers' Garage Cart on Cheetahmen-sized steroids.

<br />
<br />SNES is the reason I don't see why you need a NES cartridge with so much memory. If you really need that much memory, maybe what you really need is to make your project on SNES or Sega Genesis instead. Or something even newer.

It would be alot of animation I imagine and I suppose you could do alot with that. Like you suggested parallax backgrounds just by huge amounts of CHR could be possible, and animation of objects could be very fluid. Neo-Geo games are an example of what you can do with just massive amounts of video memory.
