		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Just thought it'd be cool to have a topic that is more focused on the idea of how to design core mechanics and what NOT to do with them. Well, I'll start it off:<br /><br />1. (After reading qbradq's post, I have to put this first) [Mainly applies to platformers] Losing control when jumping. Can't stand it, it only makes games less enjoyable. You should be able to control your character in the air, not a ton, but a bit to at least maneuver in situations.<br /><br />2. [Applies to any game ever.] Using select to enter the start menu or pause, with start being used to select a gameplay menu. I can't think of any examples off the top of my head, but it's so annoying!<br /><br />I'm sure I'll think of more/agree on others posts as this goes on. What are gameplay design choices that you hate?

I don't agree with all of the <a href="http://devmag.org.za/2012/07/19/13-more-tips-for-making-a-fun-platformer/" class="postlink">&quot;13 More Tips for Making a Fun Platformer&quot; by Diorgo Jonkers</a>, but they're still worth a read.

After all people will want to see the best of your game just at the start, saving it for later is self-sacryfying as people could not play as far.<br />- Platformers : having your weapon too short ranged (Zelda II, Faxanadu)<br />- RPGs : Requiring hours of grind levelling. I consider this a design flaw, not &quot;challenge&quot;.<br />- Relying on rare items drop to progress on the game (Bible games)<br />- Platformers : Respawning enemies (Ninja Gaiden)<br />- Platformers : Not having a &quot;ghost&quot; time after getting hit (King's knight, Cheetahmen 2)<br />- Not clearly noticing the player when an enemy takes damage (Metroid)<br />- Not clearly showing graphically which tiles are walkable and which aren't with high colour contrast<br /><br />And last but not least :<br />- Having bad music. Everything in a game can be forgiven if the music is good. Well, almost.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Actually I have one I personally consider a sin<br /><br />A &quot;Nintendo hard&quot; game that's really only hard because it makes you redo the same sections over and over till you got the exact timing. A good game imo does usually mean some memorization, and maybe has a few really hard parts, but should be mostly winnable because you're good at seeing incoming threats and managing to avoid them.<br /><br />The knight room in castlevania is a GOOD example of this, it's hard. But you wont do the same thing twice ever in that room. You need a strategy, and good reflexes. It's not all down to memorization.<br /><br />edit: Thought of another one. Enemies that respawn almost right away (or if you move the camera a little). That shit is unacceptable. edit2: looks like bregalad already had that one. Stil I second it!

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />So much of this is relative to me. <br /><br />Respawning enemies is by design even in modern Kirby, so you can score their powers.<br /><br />I tend to hate run buttons in almost every situation, (In any platformer, I'm basically never not pressing it.) but when combined with a stamina gauge in an adventure it can create some puzzles.<br /><br />A button that does something with no visual cue. Goes with run buttons above. In Super Mario Bros. the player cannot find out from the game that B does something (except shoot fireballs if you're fire mario) just by pressing it once. Modern Mario games show a change in animation, so you might explore it a bit more.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Super Mario 64 has a joystick. I assume you mean 64 DS? In that case, yes. A not run button is better. <br /><br />Animal Crossing is indeed a game where the run button just works. But not for things like flowers, which I just trample. It's because you spend time sneaking up on bugs and fish.<br /><br />Like I said, so many of these things are relative.<br /><br />Edit: Even lack of air control might not be totally bad. I believe I remember a game where the height or your jump was controlled by how hard you press down a pressure sensitive button before the jump. I haven't played it, but I'm not totally convinced it could never work.

Having no control after you leave the ground isn't a subgenre, it's a a game mechanics decision. A very frustrating one. Sure, you can get used to it, you can even learn to be really good at a game with those mechanics. That doesn't mean it's a good decision.<br /><br />Castlevania was a decent game for it's time, but it hasn't held up very well. By modern standards it's a terribly designed and implemented game, but with pretty good music and presentation.<br /><br />Here's a fun exercise: compare CV1 to any of the GBA CV games. Then ask yourself which one controls better. The <em>only</em> difference between the two are controllable jumps. They all prevent the player from moving while attacking, they both have knock-back, they both have controllable jump height, similar inertia handling, etc.<br /><br />Also, I happen to like the sword length in Zelda II. Maybe I've just got rose-colored glasses for that game the way a lot of people have for CV1 <img src="./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /><br /><br />So here's my sin contribution: Having enemies that you can't hit because they are lower than your attack. This could be because you can't duck, or because even while ducking the enemy is still too low.<br /><br />Examples:<br /><br />Battle of Olympus and Faxanadu: Can't duck, and some of the earliest enemies you can't hit, or have to have extremely good timing to hit them when they jump.<br />Zelda II: Those little spikey things on the ground. You can hit them with the down thrust, so it's not so annoying, but still.
