You'd think with such a delay they would have done more than add RAM. Increase in CPU speed would have been very nice.

<br />I see criticism of the hardware and decisions made, but no put-downs. I get the feeling that you have no mirrors where you live.

<br />
<br />See, there's another example of the double standard.
<br />
<br />When I make a criticism of the hardware decisions made, it's considered a put down.
<br />
<br />When others make a criticism of the hardware decisions made, it's not.

<br />Blargg: "You'd think with such a delay they <strong>would have done</strong> more than add RAM."
<br />
<br />CMC and blargg criticized the design decisions that the engineers made, what they <em>did</em>. You criticized the engineers themselves, who they <em>were</em>. As I understand it, the wording makes all the difference.
