		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />The hack looks very good, definitely better than "GRYZOR"... But this brought up the discussion about how important game text is. Particularly, I don't care much for text or plot, I just want to play the game. I don't mean to dismiss his efforts in hacking the game though, I acknowledge the good work and I'm sure many people will appreciate the new content.
<br />
<br />I don't know why I'm like this, but most older games really didn't need any plot, and any attempt at one just seemed like a quick excuse made up by developers to shut up anyone that might question why the heck the stuff inside the game was happening. Hell, even Atari 2600 games where the main character was just a square had complex stories (in the manuals, 'cause there was no room in the carts) trying to justify the events in the game.
<br />
<br />I prefer games that tell the story little by little, and have me absorb it naturally as I play. These games soon get me hooked up. But even with modern games, I can't stand those that force me to see long intros and read tons of text before I can press any buttons. That is ridiculous, and doesn't get me any more involved with the story, it just makes me start the game pissed off.

<br />
<br />As toku said the best is RPGs where the story is told by short but relevant scenes, with plot twits and all. Long scenes can be annoying unless they are really captivating or funny, which is not regularly the case.
<br />
<br />And there is RPGs with almost no story (eariler Dragon Warriors), while there is no-RPG games with a complex story (most recent games).

<br />Putting the story in the game helps keep the movie tie-in on message. You don't want another <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Mario_Bros._%28film%29" class="postlink"><em>Super Mario Bros.</em> that completely misses the point</a>.

If this is the only thing extra that makes the challenge, you could lose interest very fast.  If there would be more surprise, I don't know what, different enemy location of something like that, that would be nice but I guess we're almost talking of editing the content too much so some people may not agree. I will give it a try if there is a patch someday since I like contra.
