		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I discovered an incredibly nasty bug in my PPU design last night (thanks to one of Blargg's test ROMs). This bug has to do with the PPU's control register interface (i.e. the interface that the CPU uses to manage/observe the state of the PPU). This bug got me thinking about something semi-related, which I hadn't even really thought about until now...
<br />
<br />If the PPU clock runs exactly 3 times faster than the CPU clock, then doesn't that mean that for every assertion of the PPU's chip-select line (i.e. the CPU wants to read/write a PPU register), that the PPU *internally* would actually perform that read/write 3 times in a row before the CPU was even able to deassert chip-select?

<br />The PPU pinout isn't on the <a href="http://wiki.nesdev.com/w/index.php/Hardware_pinout" class="postlink">wiki's list of pinouts</a>.

<br />That's a really excellent point - and now I'm even more confused!  But...I don't think it can be edge-sensitive because then dummy-reads (e.g. LDA abs, X [with page-cross]) would have no effect.  For example (from blargg's dummy read test ROM):
<br />
<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">ldx #$22<br />lda $20E0,x&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;; dummy read from $2002</div>
<br />If I understand correctly, the above causes 2 reads of the PPU status register, once at $2002 and once at $2102.  Addresses $2002 and $2102 are on the CPU address bus in sequential clock cycles (i.e. $2102 is on the address bus in the CPU clockcycle immediately following $2002).  So in this case the PPU's chip-select line would _never_ deassert in between $2002 and $2102.  Therefore, the PPU's chip-select can't be edge-sensitive otherwise one of the reads (depending on pos/neg edge sensitivity) would be ignored.  And we already know that is not the case (i.e. both reads are detected by the PPU).
<br />
<br />Hmmm...maybe it's edge-sensitive...but only on certain registers??? :-/  Does anyone know?

<br />
<br />You've forgotten about phi2, which is also part of the chip select signal to all the peripherals.

<br />I'm not sure what you mean. The PPU just receives the 21.48M master clock signal which is then divided by 4. So the PPU is going to sample its inputs based on that frequency alone.  If you could describe in more detail what you are thinking it would help.
<br />
<br />EDIT: Also, the PPU's 3-bit address, r/w, and data lines for the control register interface are directly attached to the CPU itself.  Additionally, the PPU's chip-select pin is attached to an LS139 which is in turn connected directly to the CPU's upper address bits for decoding - and the LS139 has no clock input of any kind.  Therefore the LS139 is combinatorial which means there is only a negligible delay between a change on the CPU address bus to the PPU chip-select asserting/deasserting.  So the PPU sees whatever the CPU is currently generating without any clock-cycle delays or anything...so I'm still not sure what you're referencing PHI2 for....?

But the '139 does! On the orange-paper reverse engineered schematic it's the "A" on the left hooked up to pin 31 on the NES CPU. The famicom schematic also shows phi2 at pin 14 of the '139.
<br />
<br />So two memory addresses on adjacent cycles from the PPU will have had /CS  deasserted in the middle

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Ah, OK. I see now.  I was just looking at the LS139 datasheet itself which has no clock input.  But Nintendo literally just connected the clock to A0 of decoder-B inside the '139.
<br />
<br />Man, those schematics suck big time.  If you look at pin 13 of the PPU ("DBE", a.k.a. the chip-select pin) it doesn't even show it as being connected to the 139 in any way - it's just connected to some RC network with a couple transistors and the master osc. Am I missing something or is the schematic completely wrong? Lol.
<br />
<br />In any case, I do see what you are saying now lidnariq and I thank you very much! <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />
