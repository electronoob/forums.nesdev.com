I was wondering if I can rgb mod it the same way people rgb mod their nes or if anything different is required.  I've been looking for a pinout of the famicom ppu but so far I've had no luck

<br />
<br />Right'o. You can put the RGB PPU in any Famicom or NES, as the PPU is pin compatible between the following:
<br />
<br />HVC-001 - the original Famicom
<br />HVC-101 - the New Famicom (A/V)
<br />NES-001 - the original ‘toaster’ NES
<br />NES-101 - the NES2 'top-loader'
<br />AN-500 - Sharp Twin Famicom
<br />AN-505 - Sharp Twin Famicom II
<br />Famicombox
<br />Sharp 19" NES TV
<br />AN-510 - Sharp Video Titler
<br />C1 series from Sharp
<br />VS. System Arcades
<br />Playchoice-10 Arcades
<br />Some (non-NOAC) clones; Dendy comes to mind.
<br />
<br />There are some differences though... The AN-510, Sharp C1, Playchoice and VS. Systems all have RGB PPUs, as may the Sharp NES TV for the US market,, however VS. System PPUs have differing colour sets to prevent easy piracy.
<br />
<br />Very early HVC-001 PPUs have a design flaw that makes them unreliable, and it's possible that early PPUs will have trouble with some mappers.
<br />
<br />As I recall, the NES-101 PPU also has glitches that cause video errors and make A/V output problematic.
<br />
<br />Also note that a handful of games don't run on the RGB PPU, so you may want to consider wiring both an RGB and an NTSC Composite PPC in series, on a daughterboard with selector switches.
<br />
<br />That way, you have a fallback for non-RGB compliant games.
<br />
<br />I wonder if any of the older clone system PPUs are RGB...
<br />
<br />I never tried screwing around with them to find out.
<br />
<br />It may also be possible to design an FPGA replacement PPU that handles RGB output *and* correctly handles the games that Sharp's chip doesn't like.
<br />
<br />If you rip a chip from a VS. System, you can probably get it working too, but you’d need to be more creative.
<br />
<br />Frankly, I think it’d be cooler idea to modify a Playchoice board to accept NES/FC carts. I should hunt down some PC and VS boards to muck around with and add a cart slot to them, inside a cabinet and make a PowerPak arcade. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />

<br />Huzzah! One more project to attempt!

<br />AFAIK, they are just different revisions. They are still pin-compatible though, and that's all that should matter for the OP.

<br />
<br />yeah I just wanted to make sure they were pin compatible excluding rgb and sync.
<br />
<br />Also I'm not planning on playing a large library of games.  Of course I'm  gonna install a socket so I can swap ppus easily.  I hope that the composite ppu doesn't need the ground connections that're rgb on the playchoice ppu.  I also heard that the sync pin from the rgb ppu goes through the same connection as composite video so I'm assuming I can leave that connected to the famicom pcb
<br />
<br />and I wouldn't want to use a clone ppu I'm really big on collecting/using original hardware even if it's modded which is why I'm going with the playchoice.  And yes I agree that modding a playchoice to accept famicom/nes carts would be awesome but the playchoice pumps out inverted colours that requires an extra circuit from what I read (lazyness).  Also I really like the look of my AV famicom and would hate to have to retire it for a massive playchoice pcb wired through my supergun.
<br />
<br />Also about your little project idea here...even if you build a cart adapter to playchoice (I bet you could sell those for a nice profit) you may have the same problem with it not accepting the complete library of console games.  The playchoice system has a fairly limited library of available games.  So who really knows exactly how compatible that platform is with the entire nes/famicom selection
<br />
<br />I've found some mods that apparently make 99% of the library work no problem on a rgb modded console so once I get the ppu installed and working I'll take a look at adding those little tweaks.

<br />I also raised this point back then but had no answer. There is definitely something wrong about what Blargg said (that OAM was readable on the NES and not on FC). The most likely thing is that the's got a different PPU revision in his NES than in his FC - and that OAM is readable on newer PPU but not the older ones or something like that.

<br />
<br />The second video generator is made completely from TTL chips, mostly 74LS161 counters, multiplexers and 74LS166 shift registers. It's the way most arcade games before 1986/87 were built.
