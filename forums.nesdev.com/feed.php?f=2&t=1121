Making something work on both a PAL and NTSC NES costs something in extra complexity and lack of use of things which only work on one console. As an example of the costs, consider what it would take to make these nesdev boards accessible to someone no matter what their native language, to the point of disallowing any discussion that isn't accessible to everyone, and making everyone put up with the endless rounds of misunderstanding due to poor language skills. Without a restricted scope, many things would never get done due to the cost of the general solution (selfishness is an example of this, the scope being restricted to what is in one's own interests).<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=17">blargg</a> — Mon Feb 20, 2006 8:49 pm</p><hr />

We, here in the nesdev boards, are from many different countries, but we still like to share our projects with each other (after all, who could be more interested in nesdev'ing than other nesdev'ers?).

&gt; The PAL NES seems to be fun for demos, but I kinda fell like what I fell <br />&gt; about using MMC5. A bit like cheating. Maybe even worse.<br />&gt;<br />&gt; Exactly what I said. If it's not possible for a game to run on both systems, <br />&gt; not even through some hacking, it should not be called an actual NES <br />&gt; game. <br /><br />&gt; The wrong thing is when you can say this about a game: "This will not <br />&gt; run on a NTSC console, never, ever, no matter how much you change <br />&gt; it".<br /><br />This is pure BS IMO. The goal of retrocoding typically is to make cool stuff that works on the favorite console of your childhood memories, and I fail to see why anyone doing so should feel obliged to consider similar consoles which can only be played in black-and-white on his television, and are only used in countries far abroad which he may never even visit. And this most definitely goes for the case when his target console is far superior to the foreign similar ones mentioned above.<br /><br />Even a pirate clone with mediocre NES compatibility is a perfectly valid target system, as long as you specify it as the target system. (i.e., label your creation a Pegasus game (or any other clone system you developed it for) rather than a NES game)<br /><br />On the other hand, I agree that it is a nice goal to code your stuff for both systems. And if you wish to eBay your creation when done, you better do some thinking about how to convert (or peel off) its features to make it NTSC-compliant if you want to make some cash off retrogamers out there.<br /><br />&gt; A flaw of the PAL TVs is that is doesn't hide the top and bottom 8 pixels, <br />&gt; making a lot of glitches in pretty much every NES game.<br /><br />Come again? PAL television sets predate the NES's birth by MANY years, so I can assure you that the flaw is not in the TV. A PAL TV has 288 visible lines out of 312 total (312.5 if you want to be interlace about it), and the PAL NES just fills the empty lines out with more neat vblank time.[/quote]<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=106">Bananmos</a> — Mon Feb 20, 2006 11:04 am</p><hr />

An NTSC Genesis has 224 addressable scanlines, but 240 total outside of blanking, however it's impossible to see those 16 lines of border on most NTSC sets (but it is possible to view them on an underscanned monitor), so the system doesn't even give you access to them (it's possible to switch a PAL MD to 240 lines of addressable screen, but this doesn't work on NTSC).<p>Statistics: Posted by Guest — Fri Feb 17, 2006 2:00 pm</p><hr />
