		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />If you'd like to rip NSFs, read the NSF spec along with Chris Covell's document on getting started (both can be found on nesdev or on ZD's NSF page). Also read Gil-Galad's NSF docs (on his website) - they cover NSF ripping in a detailed manner and have many different case studies.
<br />
<br />As a general overview of what I do/use, I use FCEUXDSP along with a hex editor when ripping NSFs. In FCEUXDSP, I mainly use the debugger and the memory viewer.
<br />
<br />First thing I do upon loading the game up is checking for what is written to $4017.7 (this is easy to forget to do). This determines the frame sequencer. This is commonly done upon start-up rather than in the play or init routines. I also check for any initial writes to the sound registers.
<br />
<br />Next, I hunt down the play routine, which is usally very easy to do. I set a write breakpoint to a range of sound registers, and then look through the stack for a big difference between adjacent return addresses to find the entry point to the play routine. This works for me around 95% of the time. If this doesn't work, I examine a trace log between 2 successive NMIs containing writes to the sound registers.
<br />
<br />After successfully finding the play routine, I set an execute breakpoint on it, and from there set a read breakpoint on $8000-$FFFF in order to find where the sequence data is located in the ROM image. If the game uses DPCM, I find where the sample data is located in the ROM image by observing writes to $4012.
<br />
<br />For FDS games, oftentimes, sequence data can be found by examining file headers - sometimes they'll have nice names like MUSIC1, MUSIC2, etc. It's also really important to keep in mind that $6000-$DFFF is RAM for FDS games. Since this is true, It is often the case that a single block of memory is used to hold different sequence data chunks. You can handle this the lazy way - using 4K NSF banks and bankswitching (very inefficient if the chunks of sequence data are small), or a more efficient way - relocating the sequence data and writing some code to load it into the correct place in memory.  
<br />
<br />The init routine is usually more difficult. I employ several methods:
<br />
<br />(1) I take note of what areas of RAM are being used by the play routine, find a static value in the area of RAM, and set a write breakpoint. Then, I load up a save state before some music starts, and hopefully the debugger will snap inside of the init routine, from which I observe the stack to find the entry point.
<br />
<br />(2) I look to see if the init routine is combined with the play routine by observing what RAM addresses are read from near the beginning of the play routine. I then plug in different values in these addresses with the memory viewer. If I can change the music this way (while the game is running), the init and play routines are combined - all I need to do is write the correct values to the correct memory address(es).
<br />
<br />(3) I set a write breakpoint to $4015. Sometimes this works (although rarely).
<br />
<br />(4) I look what comes immediately before the play routine in the dissasembly, setting execute breakpoints after RTS instructions, checking each time if I have the init routine.
<br />
<br />(5) If the play routine is reached via a JMP table, chances are the init routine is in the same JMP table. In this case, I try different JMP entries in the table until the init routine is reached.
<br />
<br />(6) If the play routine is reached from an indirect JMP, I set an execute breakpoint there in hope that the init routine is called from the same place.
<br />
<br />... and probably some others I can't recall at the moment. When hunting down the init routine, I take note of whether the A, X, Y registers, or a memory address is used to init the tune (seeing that if changing their values changes what song is played). I also take note if init is done on a channel-by-channel basis, where the init routine is called separately for each sound channel.
<br />
<br />Note that some games, especially some FDS ones, have multiple init or play addresses. This is easily handled with an indirect JMP.
<br />
<br />Once I think I have the play/init addresses, and the appropriate banks for the music driver/data, I place that below a nsf header template. I then fill in the header with the correct values.
<br />
<br />I test it out. If it doesn't work properly, I debug it until it does (which can take a long time). Usually what's needed at that point are some additional initializations (often for indirect addressing or if instruction are executed in $0000-$07FF), NOPing out unneeded routines that jump to unprepped memory, and/or bankswitching. I then add whatever code/data is necessary to the NSF to get it working.
<br />
<br />Once I'm satisfied with the NSF, I then do some optimization, removing unneeded data, setting the load address, rearranging banks, etc. If I care enough, I'll rearrange the tunes so that their in "in-game" order.
<br />
<br />Finally, I add the title/artist/copyright info.

<br />
<br />The Thexder rip raises a red flag for me, as I didn't see any evidence of Beethoven's Moonlight Sonata being included (it was in the original PC-88xx game). If it is, it's sequence data format is completely different from the 1 track that's in the NSF. Let me know if it is (and how to access it in-game), and I'll update the NSF as soon as I can.
<br />
<br />Also, Thexder's data format for music is really interesting in that it's a MML-like ASCII format. Very convenient for hacking purposes.

<br />*sigh* And here I was hoping for Moonlight Sonata 2a03 rendition. The PC88 version had that song as ending music, but there's no amount of money in the world that's gonna convince me to play this to the end.
<br />Still, thanks for the rips. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />

I just wanted to make sure after going through the 5 or 6 save states I had at various points in the game, and not detecting any writes to the FDS sound registers. Thanks for the mp3 and the additional information about where the FDS channel is used.
<br />
<br />In the NSF, the FDS channel is handled completely separate from the other channels - it has its own init and play routines, so I can see why it was missed in the original rip. I added the FDS rountines to the NSF - to the opening and ending tracks specifically (17 and 18 in the NSF). Here's the updated rip:
<br />
<br /><a href="http://h1.ripway.com/kingshriek/FamicomTanteiClub.zip" class="postlink">Famicom Tantei Club NSF</a> - fix - added FDS channel to opening and ending tracks.

<br />If I don't have to do any debugging, I'd say around 20 minutes. This is including the time spent checking the integrity the rip - checking how it sounds compared to the game, and doing some optimization on the rip's file size.
