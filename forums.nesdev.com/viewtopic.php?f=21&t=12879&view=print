		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />(TASvideos, formerly NESvideos, could also have a use for it in encodes of NES games, as might speedrunners...or just people who want to make demos or mockups?) It could also just be for encoding NES screenshots, even, as that would be a single frame, though I doubt there'd be much if any advantage over existing image formats. (Note to self: add compression option of some form)<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">rainwarrior wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">If you want to make a movie-maker application for people to create an NES video, and then export it to a ROM or something like that, I figure the format of your file should be based around the technical needs of that tool and compiled ROM, not some general idea of everything the NES can do. This is approach is a little bit inside-out for that, I think.</div>That's because it's more about capturing video from a played ROM (like NSF is for audio) and encoding it in a way that reduces/removes desynch from the equation without removing any of the video data. Obviously not every event is compatible with export-to-ROM, and one could in theory make a mapper that supports a lot of it, arguably all of what commercial games did.<br /><br />Strictly speaking, one could do with just...PPUScroll, PPUMask, PPUCtrl, PPURAM-block, and OAM_Whole (and audio) events, with frame delineation. (It allows for iframes or delta just fine.) <br /><br />The problem mentioned <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/viewtopic.php?f=3&amp;t=12876#p148890" class="postlink">here</a> about having to develop a new client-side thing would be sidestepped, as one would basically be making a pseudo-mapper (again Ã  la NSF) though strictly-speaking the file format can do things the NES can't (really, just a full-palette change in one pixel). As long as an emulator renders by-scanline, it's basically a scanline-interrupt (possibly pixel-interrupt, though I can't actually think of any legitimate, desirable effects that require it, except maybe MMC2-style bankswitch) mapper with cart-side always-accessible nametables, dense paletting, and expansion audios in the truly-general case. (A very smart mapper wouldn't need to bother running much at all through the CPU except for palettes, OAM, 2A03 audio...but that's a slightly different <strong>pie-in-the-sky</strong>)<br /><br /><span style="font-size: 80%; line-height: normal">(Now why did I calculate that a feeder mapper could do 4963 straight register writes per NTSC frame...?)LDA #xx STA $yyyy, obviously you'd only need two bytes per write as there aren't so many registers...one could just point the NMI vector at the start of the 32k, do 4963 writes, and some NOPs to last until the NMI hits again, with some room for init routine...</span>

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />TASvideos actually takes a lot of submissions in the existing compact form of savestate + input stream (and you find the ROM yourself, obviously). If copyright is a concern, obviously storing the CHR data is going to be a sticky problem, which this existing method already works around.<br /><br /><br />If you're trying to facilitate high quality streaming with low bandwidth, a different approach might be to try to implement a lossless RGB video codec directed toward emulated games in general (not just NES). Something like <a href="http://lags.leetcode.net/codec.html" class="postlink">Lagarith</a>, but with features like multiple planes/layers and indexed colours w/palette. It could be integrated with emulators for efficient encoding, and an available codec could make it easy to add support from streaming services. Or even just an NES codec if that's the approach you'd rather take, but I think you could get a lot more versatile by getting away from the specifics of NES.

Whether or not TASvideos would allow a savestate seems unimportant to this discussion. My point was this format is established and used already by them and others, and it works very well for the purpose of delivering low-bandwidth perfect-quality NES video.<br /><br />(It's just not very good for integration into existing streaming forms, or for people who don't want to hunt down ROMs, etc.)
