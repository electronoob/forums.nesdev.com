Now that I think about it, it would be hilarious to have the handle 'husband'. How <em>awkward </em>it would be for people to say/call/write it, in talking with you ._.

I was growing tired of people mispronouncing the previous user ID that I had been using (the one issued by my school), so I turned to the name generator I had written, and &quot;tepples&quot; was an output. (Another valid output might have been &quot;BumpityBoo&quot;, whch I learned six years later that another Aspie ended up taking.) My Twitter username @PinoBatch and my AIM username PinocchioPoppins came from <a href="http://www.barcelonareview.com/12/e_fs.htm" class="postlink">a short story written by Frank Thomas Smith</a>. I think &quot;Pin Eight&quot; came from some graphic novel.

That name began in 2005 when I was a snotty little twelve year old. For some reason the name &quot;Bob&quot; was funny to a bunch of us kids, and many variants followed. The permutation path is as follows:<br /><br />Bob -&gt; Bobert -&gt; Bobertson -&gt; Bobinson<br /><br />A typo on a registration page gets us Bibinson, and then not long after the &quot;son&quot; was lopped off. That name stuck for a while. Under that name a lot of shitty games made in The Games Factory and later Multimedia Fusion 2 were released, and surely plenty of dumb petty internet keyboard wars as well.<br /><br />The last thing I posted on The Daily Click was mid-way through highschool: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.create-games.com/download.asp?id=8550">http://www.create-games.com/download.asp?id=8550</a><!-- m --><br /><br />It's interesting to see so many personal history-themed threads lately.

For me, they lasted from just before middleschool to a year or two before I graduated highschool. Along with them, I also played around with Megazeux a lot. I never managed to release anything though, but I bet I could've if I were better at working within a community and working with others instead of soloing everything. Nowadays, I <em>still</em> can't release anything, so some things just never change. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" /><br /><br />It wasn't just the tools, it was also the fact that you have an infinite amount of free time when you're in gradeschool. After school is over, it's just working every week with no breaks, or at least no multiple-month breaks. I spent my whole life messing around with video games, under the aspiration that this was what I wanted to do with my life, so getting into the industry would be a dream come true and would basically bring me back to those infinite summer vacations of just dorking around until you get something playable.<br /><br />And then I read about how there's basically no job security in the video game industry (at least, not any time recently), and started cursing myself for picking the wrong thing as a kid. Too late to go back now though, I don't have 15 years of experience with anything else, aside from being a gigantic butt. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" />

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I invented the username KungFuFurby on June 30, 2004 for a browser game called Kung Fu Madness. It was a combination of Kung Fu (from the game Kung Fu Madness) and Furby, which is my favorite thing that I've known since its debut.<br /><br />My username used to be a lot more inconsistent (on VGMix, I was simply known as Furby), usually involving a Furby or a Kirby. Needless to say, I leave them alone if they still exist, simply because it took me time to be able to properly interact with the online community. As time passed, I settled on KungFuFurby because my imagination was going nuts off of a piece of imagery I discovered (I still have it, but now I intentionally deviate from it knowing better these days for incorporating it into a game idea). I have a complete concept for the game that was invented during the Stencyl era, but I was trying to make the game on a few other game engines. My hope was to make this a SNES game, and I'm getting closer to getting that to come true.<br /><br />I have kept this username consistent for over 10 years, knowing that changing usernames too much may result in people not recognizing you years from now.<br /><br />My own game development days were very bumpy, and I had many incomplete products that were sometimes ridiculous that came out. One of those games, SNET The Game (for the SilverCreator community, which started as a joke idea apparently and I actually took the thing seriously), got surprisingly far along even with no graphics... and then while I was in the process of making an actual soundtrack for the game to replace what I had originally taken, my computer crashed, and I essentially quit on the game.<br /><br />I've been taking so long to make a game that I've decided to abandon the majority of the game development utensils and instead make a game for a platform that's emulated instead... for me, that's the SNES, and my fandom for the SNES is only equaled by the furby.<br /><br />I have an alternative, but I don't know if it's a professional one, and it's sightseeing (although I don't go all around the country or the world). I have a fandom for Google Street View from this particular passion.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I was volunteering for a summer kids event at my church and was running the A/V system for them.  Up near the A/V equipment is the pull rope for ringing the bell (it's an older church building with a steeple and a bell).  It was my job to ring the bell to indicate that the kids were supposed to rotate to the next station.  One of my friends who was also volunteering that weekend was chatting with me during the break and she coined the nickname &quot;qwertymodo&quot; as a portmanteau of qwerty and quasimodo to describe what I was doing.  Awhile later, I signed up for my first email address and I was looking for an alias that wasn't my name, wasn't stupidly pretentious, and that wasn't going to be embarrassingly outdated in a few years, like tacking on a year to the end (so many of my friends used their HS graduation year...).  I also wanted something unique, so that ruled out using existing character names.  I remembered the nickname qwertymodo, and it stuck.  I think I've used the same name for over 10 years now, and I think my selection criteria has worked out pretty well because <a href="https://www.google.com/?gws_rd=ssl#q=qwertymodo" class="postlink">pretty much all of this</a> is me.

I decided on &quot;Nova&quot; back in 2007/2008 or so when I and friends/relatives used to use Pictochat a lot and I wanted a cooler name to set on my DS, so I went with a space word that sounded cool (and Meteos was probably involved, especially with <a href="http://meteos.wikia.com/wiki/Thirnova" class="postlink">my favorite Meteos planet at the time</a>) and I just kept using it. Later I would find out that Nova was also Latin for new (with &quot;strange&quot; as a possible second meaning).

I was V2 because my best friend signed up to the same message board as Team Shadow. For years I went around as TSV2 (anyone remember GameWinners.com?)<br /><br />Eventually, I got into MapleStory and decided I needed a new name. I picked &quot;Shonumi&quot; because it sounded like it could be a native Japanese name (I don't know of anyone actually named that though). My full fake name is Shonumi Ikuzumo, and it carried with me until since forever, I guess. My real name is plastered over every piece of FOSS code I write, but I often just shorten it D.S. Coincedently I'm also a huge fan of the DS (and 3DS by extension).<br /><br />NESdev probably just knows me as that one person who rants on about Nintendo's portables, but I'm active in the Dolphin emulator community.
