<br />WOW! I'm super impressed. Like some other people, I'd just like to comment on how polished this is. The animation is very fluid, and the physics of the game look very smooth. I really like how you bounce on the slimes, and how you can punch yourself across a gap by punching the wall. These kinds of things make for a really cool gaming experience.
<br />
<br />I'm glad to see some more actual progress come from a NESDev homebrew project. Hopefully soon I'll finish the first 1 or 2 levels on my game so I can put it up <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />.

<br />But video makes me wonder if this is really NES.
<br />Seriously, at first I thought it's a some kind of Cave story sequel.
<br />Everything looks just awesome. Grafics aren't "best"(like kirby,smb3 or FAOD) but it have it's specifing feeling.I can't say much about music(because there's no loudspeakers in library**).
<br />But gameplay looks fantastic.
<br />Congrats <img src="./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=":wink:" title="Wink" />

<br />Some sort of background might be nice though <img src="./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /> The flat black is kinda not right with the rest of the graphics. You could try using a single, very dark brown from your rock palette to make the background more interesting.

<br />
<br />When the main character's eyes are that close together, you can simply use one black sprite for the eyes overlaid on top of the main character.  Make it low priority so it's the first one to blink away when there's more than 8 sprites in the scanline.
<br />
<br />Super Mario Bros 2 used sprites on top of the rest of the sprite to give them eyes.

<br />
<br />But anyways if this works by all means keep to this formula - to each their preferences.

You need to stop rolling by pressing left and then jump at just the right moment so you touch the bunny without destroying it. The way Rushjet1 is doing it in the video looks easier, but I haven't tried that, yet.</div>
<br />OK I tried that a lot of times it does just not work. Even if I'm able to touch the bunny wihtout killing it the second invinciblity time doesn't even come close to last long enough to cross the second set of spikes, as your main character falls back to the lower set of spikes and I have to jump twice then cross them.
<br />
<br />I even tried remain at the bunny's place to get hit a 3rd time (even if this would kill any chances for me to pass the 3rd set of spikes), but even that didn't work as I always run out of times before jumping off the 2nd set of spikes.
