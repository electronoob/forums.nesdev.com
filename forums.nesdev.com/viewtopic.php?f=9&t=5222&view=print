		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Hi,<br /><br />Apologies if this info is already widely known, I haven't seen it mentioned before. I was looking for datasheets and other info about NES-on-a-chip ICs, and found an interesting site. (If anyone knows of other NOAC manufacturers, please let me know!)<br /><br />V. R. Technology <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.vrt.com.tw/">http://www.vrt.com.tw/</a><!-- m --> make a range of chips. There are datasheets, development tools including a fully-featured emulator and examples on their web site. For convenience, I have uploaded an archive of all the datasheets and other files, which you can get from <a href="http://rapidshare.de/files/47324611/VRT_files.zip.html" class="postlink">http://rapidshare.de/files/47324611/VRT_files.zip.html</a> (the archive is about 70MB).<br /><br />Development software includes a C compiler, assembler, picture conversion tool (shows what images would look like on NTSC or PAL TV, or LCD panel), emulator (EmuVT - this seems very comprehensive, so is probably modified from an existing open-source NES emulator), tools for creating your own multi-game cartridges (demo archive includes an 8Mbyte ROM image containing Sonic the Hedgehog and (ahem) lots of other titles...).<br /><br />There are several interesting features from both a hardware and software perspective. Take for example the VT03 chip:<br /><ul><li>50/60Hz, PAL or NTSC selectable</li><li>Stereo sound! There are two APUs, the second is accessed in the region $4020-$4035</li><li>Optional &quot;one bus&quot; operation, i.e. a single ROM chip contains both PRG and CHR data. (Cartridges for the OneStation console probably use that feature.)</li><li>Timer interrupt facility, can count down PA12 or HSYNC (scanline) transitions</li><li>High-colour palette mode; according to the datasheet, there are 121 possible colours. Colours specified in $3Fxx and $3Fxx + $80</li><li>Built-in bank selection hardware, change H/V mirroring in software ($4106 bit 0)</li><li>16-colour sprites and large sprites (16 pixels wide)</li></ul>The VT18 chip has RGB output (I'm not sure whether analogue or digital) for connection to TFT LCD displays. Maybe the FC Mobile console contains one of those chips? OneStation cartridges may do also. (In which case, info in the datasheets could help emulator developers support OneStation ROM images.)<br /><br />There is a cool-looking development board, which has a daughter-board containing 32Mbyte SRAM, and a flash chip can be programmed using it too. That connects to a PC USB port.<br /><br />Edit: The VRT_files.zip archive which I uploaded to rapidshare is no longer there, so I have uploaded the file to Fileserve: <a href="http://www.fileserve.com/file/8TqGrRb/VRT_files.zip" class="postlink"><strong>File name: VRT_files.zip File size: 70.39 MB</strong></a><br /><br />Edit 2: I have re-uploaded the VRT_files.zip archive to <a href="http://www.multiupload.nl/09JVN5CC9Q" class="postlink">http://www.multiupload.nl/09JVN5CC9Q</a><br /><br />-- M

<br />Maybe someone with a dev cart and one of those consoles can test whether the second APU and other features like 16-pixel-wide sprites are usable with it?

<br />Would it be possible for someone to modify the original Famicom/NES hardware to implement the extra features of the VT03?  For example, drop-in reverse-engineered chips/additional chips?  Maybe a homebrewer could make a demo or game that uses the additional features if it detects them.
<br />
<br />And also, here's an interesting VT03-based plug-and-play console that utilizes the high-color mode:

<br />I don't get why people say that. If you're referring to WLA-DX, then yeah, it has some peculiar syntax for a couple of the SPC700 instructions. But other than that I think it works fine. I've used it for all my SPC stuff.

<br />Lots of people hate on a lot of development stuff saying it's incomplete and sucks when it works fine.
<br />
<br />And as for the extra stuff, I don't care. It's still a crap clone that has extra features. I want to make console games for the NES, not some other NES clone chip with extra crap, then I'd move to SNES. If only they spent more time on getting the NES accurate instead of putting those new modes in.

<br />
<br />Pretty cool to see those.  That pic of that system looks like it would be (well, relatively) easy to develop on the hardware because it's using a normal 3V flash memory chip.  Main thing would be having a programmer and socket that would support that type of packaging, and the patience to test your software without desoldering the chip repeatedly (a heat gun could make it easy, but could be bad for it if done repeatedly).
<br />
<br />BTW if you're not aware of it, if that's the same one I'm thinking of, there is an emulator for that chip that was on the website of the actual company that made the clone.  I only found a couple ROMs to test it with though out of curiosity, but it worked.  I don't have link for it right now though.  That'd be an easy way to start working with it.  Emulator ran normal NES roms too (looked like an adapted version of an open source emu, IIRC).
<br />
<br />Regarding the SPC-700 dev tools, I can say in my experience at least that I had zero problems using TASM when I wrote the SPC program for my NSF player.  Only annoyance was it didn't support .incbin, but of course it has .include so that is simple to work around with a simple bin-to-.DB app (which can be automated as well).  And with SNES stuff also, I can confirm that testing with ZSNES and SNES9X is 100% pointless unless you have it working on a real SNES first.  bsnes sounds good though, it just wasn't around for me to use at the time.

It is essentially a beefed up Famicom without many of the annoyances present in the older console.

It even has SMB3 as a single instruction.
