I was going to suggest something like what dougeff described to solve the metatile issue: first create a map containing only the metatiles, then export an image of them so they can be used to construct the actual map. Whenever you need to edit the metatiles, just export a new image afterwards.<br /><br />That wouldn't help much with my level format that has several depths of metatiles though, that would be completely impractical. What I need to solve that problem is an editor that lets me copy and paste custom sized blocks, with the option to align to custom sized grids. The editor wouldn't even know that blocks are being reused, the encoding script would be the one responsible for finding for all the redundancies and creating all the unique metatiles at every depth.<br /><br />As for the palette issue, you can always store 4 versions of the tiles/metatiles, and use the highest bits of the tile/metatile indices to select palettes when converting the data.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=95">tokumaru</a> — Fri May 26, 2017 8:12 pm</p><hr />

For my ninja project. I used NES screen tool, and constructed the metatiles there. Took a screenshot. Saved it in GIMP. Opened that in Tiled. Each square in Tiled represents 1 metatile of data. Constructed the levels in Tiled. Exported as .csv. Wrote a Python script to re-organize the data and compress it.<br /><br />The number of the metatile (high nibble) told my decompresser what attribute table each metatile should use.<br /><br />It was a slow process.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=7008">dougeff</a> — Fri May 26, 2017 7:39 pm</p><hr />

In the end I think it's always best to make your own tools for your own needs. (which is essentially why I made this)<br />But if you do end up using this and feel like there's something important missing, let me know.<br /><br />My biggest problem with Tiled, which is an otherwise great program, is not the format that it saves its maps in (like everyone's saying, you'd still be making your own pipeline for converting it), but that it's obviously not built to take the NES's limitations into account. It doesn't expect you to have to compress the data into metatiles (as I do in this, and figure most people creating multiple maps with recurring themes are probably doing), and it definitely doesn't know what an attribute table is :3<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=7819">Sumez</a> — Fri May 26, 2017 4:11 pm</p><hr />

I just use Fossil repositories. It is easy to set up on nearly any computer.<br /><br />I think &quot;GNU Ethical Repository Criteria&quot; are extra restrictive, although they may be reasonable for GNU projects. Some of their criteria are good for anyone, though. Specifically, good to have are: C0, C1, C2, C3, C4, B3, A0, A4, A5, A+0, A+5. In many cases, C6 should also be recommended (note: this does not mean HTTPS-only or HSTS), and A1 certainly helps. Furthermore, possibility to download with free command-line tools should also be possible, and A+2 should be followed as much as possible.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=4734">zzo38</a> — Mon Oct 17, 2016 11:47 am</p><hr />

Well how to implement it is up to each individual - I'm pretty sure my own implementation could afford a few optimizations.<br />As I said, I'm open for suggestions for new ways to structure the level data, but as of now, everything is saved into the 16x16 and 32x32 metatiles you see in the editor when exported as a assembly file.<br />(of course, this is entirely created for homebrew use, the maps are not compatible with any existing NES games)<br /><br />What I do, very squarely spoken, is:<br />- Find the coordinate of the row I want to load<br />- Use the high byte to identify which &quot;screen&quot; to load from and the low byte (divided by 32) to identify the index (column) of the metatile to load<br />- Add 8 to the index for each row and access each metatile using (inderect),Y<br />- For each metatile I read from two of the tables generated by the editor, the top left and bottom left, or top right and bottom right. Which two I use can be decided by one of the bits of the original coordinate.<br />- Repeat the same process for the smaller metatile, except this time I just load the left column on my first pass, and then the right column the second time, as I'm loading 16 pixels at a time.<br /><br />You could also load in just one row of 8 pixels at a time (if you're using horizontal mirroring or want to save cycles), or the full metatile of 32 - but I don't think there's enough vblank time for that. You can also speed things up using a &quot;secondary stack&quot;, which is what I actually do, and push into it from the bottom up.<br /><br />There are a lot of threads with better advice on how to store/load level data on this forum, so that's as far as I can go into this <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=7819">Sumez</a> — Sun Oct 16, 2016 11:29 am</p><hr />
