Ah, I see. All you need to know right now is that deep down, the CPU can only deal with bits &amp; bytes. Every command has a code, operands are either immediate values or addresses, and each operation takes a set amount of time to complete. All the shit offered by assemblers (labels, macros, and all kinds of directives) are there just to make our life easier, so that we don't have to keep track of addresses, offsets, or anything like that.<br /><br />With time, as your programs get more complex and you start to debug them in emulators such as FCEUX you'll get a better understanding of the stack, zero page and so on, because you'll be able to observe how they work, step by step. Don't overestimate the 6502 though, it's a very straightforward CPU that follows a very specific set of rules.<br /><br />Sometimes, descriptions like "<strong>B</strong>ranch if <strong>EQ</strong>ual" might not make much sense, because sometimes you are not even comparing anything, so how could the CPU even consider something equal to or different from something else? But when you look at the underlying steps of the operation you discover that what it actually does is branch when the Z(ero) flag is set, so any operation that resulted in zero (even if it was just loading the value $00 into some register) will cause that branch to be taken, even if it's not a comparison. Lots of other mnemonics can be misleading (RTS for example: it doesn't necessarily returns, it just jumps to whatever address was put at the top of the stack, be it the place where the routine was called or not), but when you look at what they actually do, step by step, you will be able to make better use of them.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=95">tokumaru</a> — Tue Nov 30, 2010 9:07 pm</p><hr />

Say that you decide to use 64 bytes to keep track of a number of items available in a level, but later you decide that you want to have 128 items per level instead of just 64. What happens if you have used the space that comes after those 64 bytes for something else? You'll have to go through all of the code looking for the parts where you used those addresses and change them to something else. If you had named the variables, it would just be a matter of changing their declarations, and the whole program would use the variables in their new place.<br /><br />Another advantage to naming your variables is that code gets easier to read. If you decide to store the number of lives at address $043F, a few days later you will already have forgotten that, and will probably be lost when looking at a "DEC $043F" instruction if you didn't write a comment indicating that this code is taking a life away. But if instead you wrote "DEC NumberOfLives", the code would be self-explanatory.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=95">tokumaru</a> — Tue Nov 30, 2010 8:06 pm</p><hr />

Like it's been said, the CPU itself has no idea what a label is. It just sees addresses and numbers, nothing more. Assemblers were invented to make our lives easier, because they allow us to use names and expressions, which are easier to understand and keep track of than raw numbers, and when you assemble the source file(s) they generate all those addresses and numbers for you.<br /><br />If you want to code in "pure 6502" you are gonna need an hex editor, and you are gonna have to input all the operations using their codes instead of their names (i.e. $20 instead of RTS - and the code changes depending on the addressing mode: there are 8 different codes for LDA, for example) and all values and addresses as plain numbers. It will take you forever to build the simplest of the programs.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=95">tokumaru</a> — Tue Nov 30, 2010 6:18 pm</p><hr />

To access the RAM, you have instructions like LDA $20 or LDX $0654.  They have the address right inside the instruction.<br /><br />I have no idea what you mean when you say "Pure 6502 assembly".  There are assemblers which let you use labels and equates, and there's the binary machine code itself which has no idea what a label is, just memory addresses.<br /><br />Some assemblers like you to use stuff like MyLabel .equ $20, then LDA MyLabel.  Other assemblers use the = directive to declare labels.  ASM6 lets you define a bunch of labels in RAM by using the ENUM directive.<br /><br />This is all specific to which assembler tool you are using to assemble your code.
