<br />
<br />There's a reason that I earned a special rank "Big Bird" on Pocket Heaven, and it has nothing to do with <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0093743/mediaindex" class="postlink">my avatar here</a> sharing a name with <a href="http://muppet.wikia.com/wiki/Pino" class="postlink">Big Bird's blue Dutch cousin</a>. In topics on PH about new releases of PocketNES, I'd test Big Bird's Hide and Speak and report the results, and I'd tend to bring up the game in any discussion about NES audio channel 5. I even traced playback once to see how the codec worked; it was a bit too complex for my tastes but led to my development of <a href="http://nesdev.com/bbs/viewtopic.php?t=3712&amp;postdays=0&amp;postorder=asc&amp;start=15" class="postlink">a different codec</a>.

You just have to remove them from the game and write some custom code. I've done this before. Although, I didn't feel like doing it for this game. The tunes were difficult enough as it was.

<br />They're rippable, except the rip can't be represented in NSF form because an NSF's play routine is expected to RTS once in each frame.

<br />I haven't yet figured out where the sample addresses are stored, or how bankswitching is managed (some of the samples in that rip are really distorted; I think they are decompressing from the wrong byte offset, which I was just guessing at anyway).

<br />I think there was a coincidencial thing with the sound file order:
<br />
<br />(Oh boy! Press the B****Slap button to move little birds)

<br />It was supposed to be "Press the big black button to move Little Bird." In BBH&amp;S, the "big black button" is the Control Pad, where all four directions move the bird to the next window clockwise. I guess the developers didn't think the target audience would have enough dexterity to press one specific direction.
<br />
<br />It appears the voiceless consonants /p/, /t/, /tʃ/, /k/, /f/, /θ/, /ʃ/ have been factored out into separate consonants because they don't depend as much on neighboring sounds as other sounds do.
