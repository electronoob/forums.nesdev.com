But, but... how can this be done while the emu is running??, since i think we should have the complete avi file and then the encoder can convert it.<br /><br />Im kinda lost about this topic and i need assistence.<br /><br />Thanks in advance.

(for how many pixels/how many seconds?) How much smaller do you want it to be?

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />DivX is really bad for retro video game footage, because it's meant for high-color real world images. MS Video 1 is much nicer for the kind of images you're compressing (no blurring), but some pixels here and there will have the wrong color.<br /><br />There are codecs made specifically for low-color game footage, such as the one that comes with DosBox (I forgot its name). It's lossless (the image is not degraded at all) and designed to take advantage of the kind of redundancy present in old game graphics.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I use the <a href="http://lags.leetcode.net/codec.html" class="postlink">Lagarith Codec</a> when making NES videos. It's losless, so there's no quality issue. FCEUX can output directly with the codec of choice, and I'd recommend keeping the sound output, since it will already be synchronized for you.<br /><br />As for your current synchronization problems, the NES framerate isn't 60hz, it is slightly different than this. A lot of emulators will generate video/sound at the NES hardware rate, so you should use the same video framerate settings as whatever generated the sound.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />It would be interesting to develop a codec for NES videos specifically, where it has a copy of the game's CHR ROM and just records diffs for final drawn positions of sprites, backdrop tiles, etc per frame, as well as palette writes. Though, I guess at that point you might as well just play back recorded inputs on an emulator, and this wouldn't work for CHR-RAM anyway. I'm sure some people will also jump at the exciting opportunity to talk about copyright issues with distributing the CHR ROM anyway...

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />It would work just as well with CHR RAM, as writes to video memory $0000-$1FFF could be logged just as easily as writes to $2000-$2FFF and $3F00-$3FFF.<br /><br />As for copyright, the renderer would compile an access log and include only those parts of the CHR ROM accessed by the PPU rendering circuitry in the video itself. If that's not enough, then the CHR ROM's contents could in theory be inferred from the pixels in the video itself. Only a few game publishers get uptight about &quot;Let's Play&quot; videos.

Stuff about VfW is horribly hard to find. Especially when you are using an other language than C(++)(#).<br />I am also currently implementing AVI recording in my emulator. It took me 4 a 6 hours just to get some information that was useful. Then I tried to &quot;compress&quot; the audio-stream also. But it seems that is something else. Even fellow developers think it is b0rked. (COMPRESSOPTIONS for audio that is)<br /><br />btw.. I have tested Video 1 for recording.. Just let it be.. It is big in size and the results makes you cry blood.. That horrible. It is horribly pixelated. I have also tried the Lagarith Lossless Codec.. The file sizes are around the same with Video 1. But the image is just perfect.<br /><br />But if you want MP4/h.263/.264 codecs? download the ffdshow directshow/vfw codec. You can configure the bitrate between 512kbs to 10000kbps. around 2000ish is acceptable.. busy games with lots of happening on the screen requires around 3500~4000kbps.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />In a few cases, I noticed that some emulators could output AVI through VfW encoders like Huffyuv (Lagarith's predecessor), but others would crash or return a &quot;failure&quot; when trying to output through those encoders. VirtualDub could encode through just about anything, however. And for some reason, VisualBoyAdvance running PocketNES was more codec-compatible than Nintendulator several years ago. This is why the video in the &quot;Balloon Fever&quot; StepMania simfile (2004) pans up and down: it's actually PocketNES's autoscrolling. So I wonder if some emulators are relying on undefined, unspecified, or implementation-defined behaviors of particular codecs or of VfW.<br /><br />I've also noticed that FCEUX's AVI output fails in Wine, encoding only three seconds of video or whatever.<br /><br />One strategy that could work is to output the audio to a wave file, output the video through a pipe to FFmpeg, and then encode the audio while remuxing it with the compressed video. That's what I did in a couple games I made in Pygame.
