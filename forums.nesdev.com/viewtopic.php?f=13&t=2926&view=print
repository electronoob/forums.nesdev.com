<br />
<br />I don't know what the hell is going on with Q.  he was in #nesdev on IRC, then banned himself and quit, took the bots, said he was going to remove the wiki, and then now I guess he banned himself here and has disappeared.
<br />
<br />Anyways, for completeness sake, and maybe someone else can figure it out, here are the IRC logs from that time:
<br />
<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">&#91;21:59:24&#93; &lt;_Q&gt; hmm, &quot;koitsu&quot; is listening again<br />&#91;21:59:31&#93; &lt;_Q&gt; though I can't fathom why<br />&#91;21:59:47&#93; &lt;_Q&gt; somehow he thinks he'll be able to get something by spying on the channel<br />&#91;22:00:45&#93; &lt;gannon&gt; I big bunch of...nothing?<br />&#91;22:00:45&#93; &lt;_Q&gt; though if he really *was* koitsu, it'd be nice if he fixed the problem with all the damn spammers signing up on the forums<br />&#91;22:01:28&#93; &lt;_Q&gt; &#40;after all, he IS the admin&#41;<br />&#91;22:01:45&#93; &lt;gannon&gt; Easiest way to deal with spammers is blocking common email domains they register from<br />&#91;22:01:51&#93; * Joins: ChrlyMac &#40;~6502@adsl-69-110-63-98.dsl.pltn13.pacbell.net&#41;<br />&#91;22:02:41&#93; &lt;gannon&gt; Although by just changing the register form on our forums we cut it down drastically.

<br />Well that's just the thing... he banned <em>himself</em>... so he <em>could</em> participate in the discussion -- he just chose not to.  I'm sure no one here would have a problem with his ban being lifted.  In fact, I'd wager that most of us would prefer it to be lifted.

<br />Actually Q was ALWAYS very rational, cold and unemotional. He would be the last of the whole earth to act impulsively without thinking seriously. The only way he could get angry would have been for a technical issue (such as someone claming something very wrong as to be accurate, wich I agree can proof a real annoyance). I really cannot imagine someone like him got mad for whathever reason.

That's the most nonsense stuff I've ever heard about !!</div><br />Banning oneself would be a way of avoiding second thoughts. It's similar to a public committment.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">Disch wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">Something got blown out of proportion and Q overreacted and made an overly dramatic exit. I've seen things like this happen many times before.</div>
<br /><em>Nobody</em> ever overreacts to something. A reaction is always to the sum total of a person's experiences up to that point, but others only see the immediate <em>catalyst</em>, and often dismiss what happens next. Sure, it might be spilled milk, but the angry outburst is not merely about spilled milk.

I was unable to complete my destiny. I'm not dign to be your friend. I'm gonna sucid myself. Go alone, [...].".
<br />
<br />And later, they of course always think again, change their mind and eventually come back to hero's side for the rest of the adventure. I hope Quietust will follow that path too.

<br />
<br />It <em>seems</em> Q was requesting some admin action regarding this forum, of being overloaded by "dummies" or "spammers" registering like crazy. Well, I have/had the same issue in my forum, though I delete those ones and ban their IPs/e-mails when possible. Plus, the same <em>man</em> that manages the IRC channel, regarding the ban list, from what I read the text... Since it took zero effect, he "vanished".
<br />
<br />Be clear: my <em>speculation</em> after reading the IRC logs... ^ ^ and I'd like to make clean my respect by everyone.

<br />The spam registration is very annoying, I would know because I get a bounced email from probably all of them.
