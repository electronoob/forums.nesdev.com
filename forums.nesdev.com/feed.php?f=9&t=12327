I really appreciate everyone's help and responses.  I think my best bet is to email some of the eBay sellers and see if they know.  If not, maybe I'll just buy one and if it doesn't pass the expansion audio through, hopefully I can open it and add the one wire necessary.<br /><br />As a backup plan, I already own a copy of Gyromite with the Famicom adapter in it.  I'd rather not use it though, both because I really hate destroying perfectly good games...even crappy ones.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=6182">robneal81</a> — Tue Feb 03, 2015 7:25 am</p><hr />

I just picked up a Gyromite that looks like it might have the adapter from the eBay pictures (For $5 I'll take a gamble). I'll try and choose a resistor that sounds good with my Gimmick! cartridge since that's all I wish to use it for. On the NES side I'm using an ENIO board which has the proper connections for audio mixing already. I'll post what resistance I go with for Gimmick once it's done.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=5314">mikejmoffitt</a> — Mon Feb 02, 2015 9:02 pm</p><hr />

I have an NES-JOINT adapter taken from a Gyromite. (I don't feel bad, because it was <em>Gyromite</em>.)<br /><br />Preparing it to work with the NES expansion audio mod just requires one extra wire soldered on (connecting Famicom cart audio out to NES expansion pin 5). For the expansion audio mod inside your NES, though, tou should use a potentiometer instead of just a fixed resistor, so that you can adjust the volume. Famicom games did custom mixing inside the cart, so there's no one resistance value that will be satisfactory for all of them, the output varies considerably.<br /><br />I have to take apart my NES to fit the NES-JOINT + famicom catridge inside. It doesn't normally fit in the tray carriage.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=5165">rainwarrior</a> — Mon Feb 02, 2015 5:51 pm</p><hr />

I do, specifically <a href="http://portable.0catch.com/famicom.html" class="postlink">one</a> taken from a Stack-Up cart<sup>[1]</sup> -- but I also own both a Famicom AV and a NES so I don't really have need for an adapter.<br /><br />&quot;A link to an adapter&quot; probably wouldn't be helpful, mainly because most of the adapters are vague/ambiguous and there are tons of Chinese clones which may or may not be identical (e.g. an adapter that looks a certain way and passes pin 46 may be cloned by a company in Taiwan or China who chooses not to pass pin 46, yet both adapters look nearly the same).<br /><br />I don't know of anyone present-day who makes/manufacturers such adapters.  Maybe someone else does?<br /><br />I'd really suggest just asking the eBay seller.  Think of it this way: if they don't know, it's in their best interest to find out using a continuity test, because then they can put that in their auction description (&quot;supports pin 46 pass-through for Famicom expansion chip audio; will work if NES is modded to support this!&quot;), which in turn would make them more money.  The test takes 15 seconds, if that.<br /><br />Edit: I think I know why nobody makes these.  The &quot;NES side&quot; of the connector needs a <a href="http://wiki.nesdev.com/w/index.php/CIC_lockout_chip" class="postlink">CIC chip</a> for it to work on a NES (and the CIC chips differ depending on if NTSC or PAL), and those chips are Nintendo-proprietary.  Famicom carts don't have CIC chips.  So after-market adapters must either have a way to fake out the CIC chip in the NES console, or have their own pirated version of Nintendo's CIC.  So if someone was to produce an adapter present-day, they'd probably have to make a little socket for the CIC chip and tell the purchaser &quot;you need to get a CIC chip yourself&quot; (desolder one from a random NES cart).<br /><br /><sup>[1]</sup>: Some (not all) first-gen NES games from Nintendo circa 1985 contained Famicom carts with Famicom-to-NES adapter boards inside called &quot;NES-JOINT-01&quot;.  These adapters do pass through pin 46 (I just verified with a multimetre).<br /><br />However, the NES-JOINT-01 adapters (when removed) do not work well with NES front-loaders because there is no shell/casing that surrounds them, making them difficult to get in/out of a NES.  Plus, they'd require you to open up your Famicom carts, pull the PCB out, put it in the NES cart which contained the adapter (assuming it'd even fit), and then use them that way -- it's not very feasible.  &quot;Pre-packaged&quot; products like what you've been linking to are much more usable.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.racketboy.com/forum/viewtopic.php?p=307547" class="postlink">Here is some long highly OCD/weird/ranty thing</a> about the NES-JOINT-01 adapters.  The easiest way to detect if they have an adapter, by the way, is to look at the cartridge pins -- the ones with an adapter tend to have little &quot;tails&quot; on each contact pin, while non-adapters don't.  Just in case you wanna go on a quest to find one.  I can take a picture of what the &quot;tails&quot; look like (vs. a normal cartridge edge connector) if you need a comparison.  (Someone in that thread did post such, but the images are long gone)<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3">koitsu</a> — Mon Feb 02, 2015 3:58 pm</p><hr />
