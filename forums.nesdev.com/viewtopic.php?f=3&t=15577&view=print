		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Hello,<br /><br /> I've contacted a programmer who has agreed to code a game for me - which includes imported levels from an old NES title.<br /> I've sent the .nes file.<br /> However, they have stated to me that I need the &quot;source code&quot; to import the levels.<br /> He asks, &quot;How can I change things if I don't have code for it? It won't even let you extract graphics from that, not quality at least. To make modifications in the game there needs to be a backend for it...I get the front end game, but for modifications backend is required.<br /><br /> Could you help make sense of this? I also understand there may be some document(s) available here to help w/ debugging and if I send an emulator, this may solve the issue. I'm not sure if this is what they mean though.<br /><br /> Please understand, this is someone supposedly with knowledge of C++/ C#/ Python/ Java/ Linux/ Database/ VB/ Mobile Platforms and ECommerse plus more.<br /><br />  Thanks very much!<br /><br />    -Jared

This should let you build the nametable data for that level. From there, your programmer should be able to build metatiles, Markov models, or whatever other map compression method he prefers.<br /><br />That or he's using the correlation between &quot;not having the source code&quot; and &quot;not having the rights&quot; to politely decline what might be copyright infringement.

Your programmer is correct about needing source code, but no source code is available, in general, for classic nes games. You need someone who is skilled at reverse engineering, and 6502 assembly.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />yeah, they mean to write it in C+...do you know someone with 6502 knowledge?<br /><br />also, someone just responded on other forum...<br /><br />&quot;Unfortunately many high level programmers have no idea how things work on low level (although if he know C he should at least understand how pointers work).<br /><br />But yeah, the way to go would be to use a debugger to understand how the levels are done. Using a debugger you can see the disassembled NES code (which as far as I know be close to the original uncommented source code anyway because I think they were programmed in assembly) and see the graphics on VRAM. It may be worth searching here or on Google to see if someone has documented the level format.<br /><br />I can't suggest a specific debugging emulator because I've never used one for NES.&quot;

You might be able to write nametable logging as a Lua extension for FCEUX.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />It takes someone reasonably familiar with the NES architecture and 6502 assembly to be able to extract something from an .nes file. If your programmer doesn't already know how to do it, it's unlikely he'll want to learn it for this one project.<br /><br />Using debugging tools in an emulator you can somewhat easily extract the graphics of a level while playing it. You can periodically dump the name tables to files as the screen scrolls, and then piece everything together to get a map describing which tiles go where, and this is something your programmer might be able to use. Unfortunately, that doesn't include any of the collision and object information.
