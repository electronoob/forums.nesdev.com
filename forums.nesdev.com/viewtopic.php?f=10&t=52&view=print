<br />
<br />All I'm asking now is for just a 1 screen name table collision detection. I would have no idea how to set that up when putting scrolling into account. So for now I'll jut start with reading a single nametable and detecting which tile the sprite is on and such. thx <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":-)" title="Smile" />

<br />What I've always planned on doing is using the map data stored in the CPU's ROM/RAM for the collision detection.  Preferably, it'd be much smaller than an uncompressed 1024 byte nametable.

<br />
<br />Another option is to use a system of 2x2 pseudo-tiles and use a whole byte for each of them. This will cost you 240-bytes instead but allows for a much more interesting collision system.
<br />
<br />You could also access the map data directly in ROM, but that would make level compressions impossible.
<br />
<br />None of these methods can handle permanent dynamic backgrounds by themselves, these are application specific and require all sorts of nasty hacks to save memory.

<br />Precisely. Here's some code to get to rolling (okay, I'm bored..).
<br />
<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">;; this is the 120 byte array with a single bit per tile<br />;; 32 bits &#40;4 bytes&#41; columns x 30 rows<br />coltab&nbsp; &nbsp;= $300<br /><br />;; lookup the bit in the collision array<br />;; input: &#40;x, y&#41; = coords<br />;; output: zero flag set on collision<br />checkbit:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;;; calculate x byte index<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;txa<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;lsr<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;lsr<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;lsr<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;sta tmp<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;;; calculate y byte index<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;tya<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;asl<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;asl<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;;; get the final table pointer<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;adc tmp ;; no need to clear carry since y won't overflow<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;tay<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;;; lookup x bit pattern<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;txa<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;and #7<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;tax<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;lda bittab,x<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;;; check it<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;bit coltab,y<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;rts<br /><br />;; a table of bit patterns<br />bittab .byte $01,$02,$04,$08,$10,$20,$40,$80<br /></div>
<br />I know it could've been a lot faster with some more tables and one of those neat x-masking invalid opcodes. But it's supposed to be pedagogical, not an example of production code.

<br />
<br />I don't know how useful this idea would be, but if all of your tiles are going to have 'flat' slopes (slope is constant throughout the tile), you could program a simple Y=mX+b type thing for 16x16 metatiles (correct term?).

<br />
<br />What I planned on doing was having a seperate table of the pixel offsets within each metatile (if it's not solid or empty).  Then convert that position to screen pixels and see if it's in range of some parts of the sprite.

<br />
<br />Now I'm guessing that'd I'd want the sprite control routine to move the sprite 16 pixels at a time so that its proportional to the 16x16 tiles on the screen?
<br />
<br />For the collision I'm going to use 234 bytes RAM to copy the Nametable in 16x16 metatiles. I guess I'd need some kind of formula to figure the byte of RAM is in accordance to what tile on the screen (y * 16 + x) and then have the sprites corrdinates range from x(0-15) and y(0-14).
<br />
<br />I sorta want to move the sprite pixel by pixel right now, but if it'd be too hard for collision detection I can change it to moving in 16 pixel increments.
<br />
<br />So would I use some kind of formula or lookup table to match them up if I wanted to do pixel by pixel sprite walking collision detection (not pixel by pixel collision detection, I want the sprite to walk pixel by pixel and the collision detction to be 16 by 16 pixels......understand what I mean?) ?
<br />
<br />And one last thing, when I finally put my scrolling engine into this.....is it going to get a lot harder (I would prolly have to change the RAM usage around unless I used 1-screen mirroring huh?)?
<br />
<br />Thanks for your help.

<br />Fortunately, there's no need to do so.
<br />Instead you can treat things like a circular buffer, just like you would do tilemap scrolling. Admittedly it's somewhat favorable to wrap directly to a new line instead of the beggining of the current one, like the video hardware would.
<br />
<br />Lets say you've got a small 3x3 (meta-)tile screen in it's initial (unscrolled state):
<br />0 1 2
<br />3 4 5
<br />6 7 8
<br />
<br />Instead of the whole 16-byte buffer when scrolling to the buffer left by one tile we simply replace to column that's been scrolled out:
<br />1 2 3
<br />4 5 6
<br />7 8 a
<br />
<br />And to scroll down we repeat the procedure but offset the buffer by a whole line instead of a single tile.
<br />4 5 6
<br />7 8 9
<br />a b c
<br />
<br />To avoid growing this buffer to infinity you can simply clip the index to a single byte (which is the fastest way to do things anyway). On a normal screen with a status bar and an extra tile row for each axis (for scrolling) this should still fit in a single 256-byte page.
<br />
<br />In your collision lookup code you only have to keep track of the current scrolling offset, calculated through scroll_x+scroll_y*16, and add it to the lookup address.
<br />
<br />Here's an updated version of my previous code:
<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">;; the 16x15 byte collision array, occupies a full 256-byte page for natural wrapping<br />coltab = $300<br /><br />;; the collision scroll offset, increase this by 1 to scroll left and by 16 to scroll up. this is also used as a starting point when updating the table during<br />colscroll = $400<br /><br />;; input: x = sprite x-coord in pixels, y = sprite y-coord in pixels<br />;; output: a = collision byte<br />lookup:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;;; divide x-coord by 16 to get the horizontal tile index<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;txa<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;lsr<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;lsr<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;lsr<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;lsr<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;sta tmp<br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;;; divide y-coord by 16 to get it's tile index and multiply it by 16 again for the collision table lookup<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;;; &#40;x &gt;&gt; 4&#41; + &#40;y &gt;&gt; 4&#41; &lt;&lt; 4 = &#40;x &gt;&gt; 4&#41; + &#40;y &amp; 0xf0&#41;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;tya<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;and #$f0<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;;; combine x and y coords into a byte offset<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;clc<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;adc tmp<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;;; compensate for scrolling by adding the current offset<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;adc colscroll<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;tax<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;;; lookup the byte and return it<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;lda coltab,x<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;rts<br /></div>
