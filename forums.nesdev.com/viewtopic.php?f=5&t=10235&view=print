People, please consider hosting your files on a service like <a href="https://sites.google.com/" class="postlink">Google Sites</a>. It's free! Limits are 20mb per file, 100mb per site. But as far as I can tell, you can have as many sites as you want.

It's a bit more complicated with file hosting, as making something available 24/7 is slightly more expensive.<br /><br />zzo38: Not everybody has a PC to leave on 24/7 as a home web server. Nor does everybody have a home Internet connection that allows a web server. Some people have only a NAT IP with no way to forward ports 443 and 80. And even people who have their own dynamic IP may be on an ISP plan that doesn't allow hosting &quot;servers&quot;.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />When Google drops products they typically give a long lead time for you to get your data off. If you're still active and care about what you're hosting, you can move it somewhere else. If you're long gone we'll at least have the data around for a while afterwards.<br /><br />When hosting your own site it's gone pretty much as soon as you stop caring, and there's rarely any lead time for the community to recover and mirror the data.<br /><br />I'm not saying Google Sites is the 100 year solution, just that it's a far better solution that hosting your own site as far as posterity is concerned.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Dropbox is crazy simple to maintain and update what you're sharing.  They also give 2GB of free storage to start.  Not sure how they handle 'inactive' accounts though...<br /><br />Even if you don't use it for hosting files it's crazy simple version control of anything as it saves every version of any file for later restoration without you having to think twice about it.  If a version was ever saved to a folder on your PC's dropbox folder there's a copy of it available to you on the net.  I've used it countless times to restore files I've broken and had to take hours/days/weeks/months steps back to get to a working state again.  SVN and stuff is great, but you actually have to think about your desire to commit in a copy.  You're required to save before compiling, thus you're guaranteed a copy of every version you've ever had when it's all in dropbox.

It's a damn case study on why you should never rely on web apps for any serious personal use or for business: you never know when the company will just arbitrarily decide to kill what you've come to rely on.<br /><br />Whereas I am still rocking Hex Workshop 2.54, which I downloaded in 1998.
