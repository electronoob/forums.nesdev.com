		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />So today, I had a bit of extra time to myself so I thought I'd mess around with Final Fantasy 3 on my PowerPak and try to figure out what the heck was going on with it. I haven't had much success.
<br />
<br />I don't know besides the airship glitch if anybody else is having any problems, but I'm having a major problem with FF3 relating to SRAM. It started out when I noticed my FF3 saves weren't saving or loading. So that's when I tried out a couple of other things to see exactly how it was behaving.
<br />
<br />When I don't load any .SAV file, and continue to play the game for a while until I can save, I try to dump the save afterwards to a blank .SAV file. The data that is dumped into that file is not even related to FF3; it's data that was in $6000-$7FFF from the PowerPak menu. When I load an existing FF3 SAV file that I created on my computer, FF3 doesn't load/recognize the data, but when I play until a save point, dumping afterwards to a blank .SAV file dumps the data from the .SAV file I attempted to load previously.
<br />
<br />So it may be that WRAM read/writes aren't working. I tried to see if for some reason the copy I had was bad and wasn't enabling reads or writes, but it wasn't the case. I overwrote the first couple executed lines of code in the ROM to:
<br />
<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">lda #$80<br />sta $A001&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;;Enable SRAM chip, allow reads/writes<br />sta $6000&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;;Write to SRAM<br />loop:<br />jmp loop<br /></div>
<br />
<br />Dumping the contents to a blank .SAV file showed that $80 was not written to $6000. It behaved the exact same way as FF3 did without that code.
<br />
<br />I'm pretty confident whatever problem I'm experiencing here is directly related to the airship glitch. That information about the airship's location is undoubtedly stored somewhere between $6000-$7FFF. If it can't read/write data properly to that memory location, it's no wonder there are issues with this sort of thing.
<br />
<br />Also, I'm able to load/save my game just fine with FF1 and some other games, so it seems specific to this mapper (or with the emulation of TNROM).
<br />
<br />Does anybody have this issue as well? Am I the only one who's not able to load/save with FF3?

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Okay, so an interesting update here. I made a test ROM on the PowerPak that uses MMC3, battery enabled, 32k of PRG with 8k of CHR ROM. With that, I was still unable to read or write to SRAM. I was able to using various emulators. I concluded there must be some sort of issue with my MMC3 emulation on my PowerPak.
<br />
<br />That's when I attempted to -downgrade- my PowerPak mappers. What do you know, as soon as I did that, I was able to load my FF3 save! I am also able to dump SRAM data to a SAV file. However, there are graphical issues that I believe were fixed in updates. I don't believe the mapper-controlled mirroring part of it was working properly before the updates, because the ROM I have is set to horizontal mirroring by default, though FF3's code switches it to vertical through register writes. When I turned it on, it was glitching like it was set to horizontal. After switching the header info to be set at vertical, everything worked fine.
<br />
<br />I have yet to test the airship out to see if that glitch is still occuring. But for now, it seems downgrading was more of a solution than upgrading (which I had tried previously). I'm curious if anyone has issues with MMC3 games that use battery with Mapper versions 1.30+. Downgrading to 1.20 solved the problem I was having with the battery, so unless I'm not loading it correctly, I think there's a bug with the updated mapper version.
<br />
<br />EDIT:
<br />
<br />I have indeed verified the airship glitch is <em>not</em> present when playing FF3 on Mapper Version 1.20. Going in and out of Jinn's cave proves that the airship is still there. So I'm pretty positive there is a problem with the mapper update that prevents proper access to/from SRAM, which would provide adequate explanation for the issues I was having and the airship glitch.

<br />
<br />Off the top of my head, I remember Tecmo Super Bowl saving correctly.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I think I found the bug (thanks to bunnyboy). Apparently loopy's MMC3 implementation maps a different 8K WRAM bank in (there's 32K WRAM) based on what PRG bank is mapped in at that time, so unless the write is done in bank 0, 4, 8, ... it will go to a wrong bank. Unless I'm mistaken <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /> I informed loopy about this in IRC so hopefully he can fix it.

Going in and out of towns seems fine, but fighting a battle causes the airship to disappear. Very disappointing <img src="./images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" alt=":(" title="Sad" />.

<br />There is a solution (if I was right about the problem in the first place.. I never verified it with code). It's up to loopy or bunnyboy to fix it.
<br />
<br />Meanwhile you can try if it works with my mappers: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://kkfos.aspekt.fi/projects/nes/powerpak/save-state-mappers/">http://kkfos.aspekt.fi/projects/nes/pow ... e-mappers/</a><!-- m -->

<br />Give this a try.  I fixed a careless bug thefox pointed out to me.
<br />I also changed the IRQ code to make it more accurate.  I don't know if it makes a difference in any games (probably not)

<br />Did you start the game from the beginning with the new mappers or did you load a game that was saved with old version of the mappers? The only surefire way to test it is to play it from the beginning with the new mappers unfortunately...
