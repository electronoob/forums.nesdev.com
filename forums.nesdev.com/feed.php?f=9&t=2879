i've just recieved a creatom and it uses the same chip... so any info about it will be great. <br />Btw, i'll dump the first 32k and i'll look for any write to that rom area. I guess that when i find writes to that area i will have to write there different values and see what happens.... but ¿wich things should i expect to happen?<br /><br /><br />p.d i've scaned some pcbs, and one of them is creatom's pcb ...<br />edit: i know the pic is big... but yesterday was a lot bigger ^^¿<br /><img src="http://i25.photobucket.com/albums/c91/piteta/nes/PCBS_B.jpg" alt="Image" /><br />well, in that pic there's a creatom pcb together with other carts i'd like to dump, so expect more questions about them in this thread.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=266">piteta</a> — Mon Jan 22, 2007 9:45 am</p><hr />

Usually they stand out because they will write to ROM area (8000-FFFF) and alot of times the bankswitches occur in the very end of the CPU space, say FE00-FFFF.  not always, but alot of times.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=230">kevtris</a> — Thu Jan 18, 2007 3:42 pm</p><hr />

This will activate the flip flop wien both reading and writing data from/to $8000-$ffff.<br />So, for example, when "lda #$04" is executed, the flip flops will be loaded with $a9, then $04, and I don't think they wanted to do that.<br />So /PRG A15 MUST be ORed with R/W in order to activate the flip-flops so that only writes affects them.<br /><br />EDIT :<br />Huh ??

If the bankswitching would be at $8000, an additional OR gate (with bus conflicts) or an additional adress decoder (without bus conflicts) would be needed. This could be done with a '139 instead, but I guess they needed all 3 of '138 adress (A14-A13 with /PRGSEL for decoding, and M2 for enabling ?).<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=38">Bregalad</a> — Wed Jan 17, 2007 1:24 pm</p><hr />

If this pcb didn't have that custom chip, it would be very similar to that ¿ave? mapper made of those two ls chips... but it has it so i don't know how to begin... and what troubles me most is that i'wont be able to know wheter is a good dump or not until that mapper is emulated <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" alt=":(" title="Sad" /><br /><br />¿can anybody help me?<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=266">piteta</a> — Wed Jan 17, 2007 9:49 am</p><hr />
