		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I don't remember where I found it, but I'm looking at a .asm file that's essentially a hello world program, and it raises a number of questions for a noob like me, despite consisting mostly of comments and very little code.
<br />
<br />1. The beginning of the file has hardly any comments.
<br />
<br />.segment "HEADER"
<br />    .byte "NES", 26, 2, 1
<br />    
<br />; CHR ROM data
<br />.segment "CHARS"
<br />
<br />.segment "VECTORS"
<br />    .word 0, 0, 0, nmi, reset, irq
<br />    
<br />.segment "STARTUP"
<br />
<br />.segment "CODE"
<br />
<br />I've been trying to read up on this, and I think CA65 uses these segments keywords to determine where in the resulting .NES file it will put your data upon assembly/compilation (are they the same, by the way?), since e.g. CHR data has to be in a certain address range within the .NES, though if I'm wrong about this, please do correct me. Anyway, is this the full list of possible segments? If not, where can I find such a list, if one exists?
<br />
<br />2. [ANSWERED] This particular .asm file has the following labels:
<br />reset
<br />@vblankwait1
<br />@clrmem
<br />@vblankwait2
<br />forever
<br />irq
<br />nmi
<br />
<br />What is the purpose of having an @ at the beginning of a label?
<br />
<br />3. What is the significance or purpose of the leading 3 zeroes, here?
<br />
<br />.segment "VECTORS"
<br />    .word 0, 0, 0, nmi, reset, irq
<br />
<br />If I got this right, the NMI vector is at $FFFA, so whenever an NMI occurs, the program goes to the NMI label (which is located at the address stored at $FFFA) and starts running the code there. The address to this label is 2 bytes long ($FFFA). Do each of the leading zeroes also represent 2 bytes, i.e. does the vectors segment start at $FFF4? Which interrupts do the first 3 zeroes correspond to? Are they only used by mappers, and is that why they have been set to 0 in this particular program (which doesn't use mappers)?

I can assure you that this has nothing to do with mappers, and that only the last 6 bytes are used by the CPU as vectors. I have no idea what those zeroes are doing there.
<br />
<br />Sorry if I can't help with the CA65-specific questions. Having to build scripts before being able to assemble my programs has really put me off (and I don't feel well using scripts other people made unless I completely understand them). The possibility of using segments is hardly worth the trouble IMO. I've been using ASM6, and I have no trouble making sure that everything ends up in the correct places in the NES file myself. From what I heard CA65 is very good though, so I hope you get your answers.

<br />Thanks for the offer. When looking at them, everything makes sense, but I imagine this is the kind of thing that can be done in various ways, and depends on the style of the programmer. For example, in your SNROM template I don't see a VECTOR segment, but you obviously got the vectors in somehow. I have to know more than what a given script is doing in order to design my own.
<br />
<br />I guess one of the reasons I don't like linking scripts is that they are just one more thing you have to design, and consequently one more thing you might want to redesign in the future when you notice the flaws of the one you're using. Also, due to the fact that I develop on several different computers, I like to keep everything (source, documents, tools, etc.) in a single archive, so it's better that the tools are simple and small. I can't rely on make files or other things that require setting up a complex development environment.
<br />
<br />I appreciate your offer though, and I'll be sure to ask you any questions I might have about this in case I decide to give CA65 another shot someday.

<br />I gave my entire cc65 folder a search for fff4 and found nothing. I did find this line in ld65.exe, however:
<br />
<br />ROMV: start = $fff6, size = $c, file = %O, fill = yes;
<br />
<br />Doesn't make much sense to me. First of all, this would mean that these 3 zeroes can't all represent two bytes each. Second, $fff6 + $c is more than $ffff. Any clues?
<br />
<br />Anyway, still haven't found an answer for my first question.

You can see the NES script at <a href="ftp://ftp.musoftware.de/pub/uz/cc65/snapshot/sources/cc65-snapshot-2.13.9.20120127/src/ld65/cfg/nes.cfg" class="postlink">ftp://ftp.musoftware.de/pub/uz/cc65/snapshot/sources/cc65-snapshot-2.13.9.20120127/src/ld65/cfg/nes.cfg</a>
<br />
<br />It's basically designed for use with cc65 and not really what most ca65 users would expect. Which is why most people write their own. (Which are usually much less complex than this.)
<br />
<br />So, yes, the vectors section starts at $FFF6 and it's size is $C. No, that doesn't make any sense, but that's how it is. Which means that the code that you've got is buggy. (Or was written for a similar, but differently screwed up linker script.) Each of those zeros is 2 bytes (which is what '.word' means). The end result is this:
<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">00FFF6&nbsp; 00 00<br />00FFF8&nbsp; 00 00<br />00FFFA&nbsp; 00 00&nbsp; ; NMI<br />00FFFC&nbsp; nmi&nbsp; &nbsp; ; reset<br />00FFFE&nbsp; reset&nbsp; ; IRQ/BRK<br />010000&nbsp; irq<br /></div>
<br />Which I doubt would link at all.

<br />Heh, I don't even know how to get Wine to work! XD I don't really have access to any Linux PCs. Now that I think of it, I don't carry ALL the tools around... Emulators for example are not included in my archives... pretty much everything else is though.
<br />
<br />I should probably keep two different archives instead, one with the tools (which don't change often) and the other with code and documents.

<br />The NES 'crt0.s' used by cc65 has the following code in the vectors segment. I haven't bothered to figure out what the extra "vectors" are for. From the question marks, the author of the comments doesn't seem to know himself. It clearly expects the vectors section to start at $FFF4, which means the default linker script is broken.
<br />

<br />The thing is, cc65 is designed mostly for home computers, and NES support is a bit of a second class citizen at best. The other platforms expect the OS to handle the vectors and stuff, so it's no surprise things are a little odd.
<br />
<br />That's not to say cc65 doesn't work well on the NES. It's just that the out of the box configs are pretty bollixed.
