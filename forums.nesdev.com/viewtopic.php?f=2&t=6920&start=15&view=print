<br />
<br />So the project is compiling and running again now so I thought it was time to try to include the bits of common code/tables in two different banks.
<br />
<br />I have an include (.h) file now that contains the addresses of the routines in that code as .globals.
<br />
<br />Where I include the .h file and the common code it relates to in the first bank it compiles OK. However in the second bank, I get several ld5 errors;
<br />
<br />"Warning : Duplicate external identifier : 'xxxxxxxxx'
<br />
<br />which all relate to the routine addresses that are in my .globals list.
<br />
<br />Can any see the (probably obvious) problem?

<br />
<br />So I split the routine addresses for the common code into their own .globals list and then didn't include that list in the code for the bank where the second version of the common code resides.
<br />
<br />A little messier than I'd have liked but it seems to work. Can now jump around in either bank and the common routines keep it all intact.
<br />
<br />I need some coffee now, couldn't sleep because this thing was on my mind and I woke up at 5.45 am to try to fix it. :S

<br />Now I've re-read it, you identified and worked around the problem in your example. I was probably too tired to realise.

<br />Thanks blargg, help and guidance much appreciated.

<br />
<br />Sorry Tepples, mine was probably a bad example. The <em>actual</em> CPX instruction that it was failing on was in a routine that cleared a certain range of variables. So I set an arbitrary label at the start and one at the end and then in the clearing routine just do the CPX with #end-start so that I can add more vars to that group and know that they'll be cleared appropriately.
<br />
<br />Having said that, your example did give me a good idea to change some of my constants etc.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I am not the original poster, and I don't intend to hijack this thread nor his question.... but, I have a question relating to the definition and usage of global variables.
<br />
<br />(ps- I am an accomplished C/C++/asm programmer w/ 20+ years exp)
<br />
<br />What is wrong with simply using ".globalzp" declarations in a common header file, and then ".word" (or .byte or whatever) in a single ".s" file?  
<br />
<br />This is analogous to using "int xx = 99;" in a .c file and "extern int xx;" in a .h file (that is included by every .c file, including the one containing 'int xx=99;').
<br />
<br />The assembler will automatically declare the proper imports and exports in each ".o" file, and the linker will automagically resolve them.
<br />
<br />What is gained by wrapping it all up in macros?  It seems like an extra (un-needed) layer of abstraction to me.
<br />
<br />Maybe I misunderstood the original question.
<br />
<br />Was it a concern for the exact absolute address that the linker would assign to each global, or a concern for syntax of getting ".global / .globalzp" to work at all?

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Exactly, you can use .global as "extern", and .word/.res as the definition in one source file. Unlike with C, though, there's no type information, so for example a buffer size must be stated as a separate constant, whereas in C you could use sizeof. The proposed macro in my previous message (for which I couldn't implement the sizeof part due to ca65 bullshit bugs) was sort of like the attempts in C to have a single file of globals, with a preprocessor flag that either makes it merely declare them, or actually define them.
<br />
<br />See my earlier warning about my approaches <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />
<br />
<br />So, I agree; .global is the way to go unless you like experimenting with the language more. Before this thread I only knew about .export and .import, which are much more tedious to use. Of course I assemble most of my programs as a single source file, so don't ever even export any names.
