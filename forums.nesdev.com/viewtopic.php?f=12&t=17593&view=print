		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Hm. The parts on the board aren't complex enough match the full technical description in nocash's FullSNES. But unfortunately, too many traces are hidden under parts – especially the small 74xx series ICs – to be able to figure out what the hardware actually does do.<br /><br />The only thing I'm pretty certain of is that I believe the 74xx parts aren't connected to the data bus, so those registers documented at $21D0/21E0/21E5 shouldn't care about the specific value written.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Why are you saying SNES-CD Ram? Wasn't it a CD ROM? Or did you mean the WRAM chips on the cart?<br /><br />The parts list is nice, thanks!<br /><br />All the logic chips are looking more or less complex enough to me. I haven't tried to follow the databus traces to see if they are going to the logic chips, but if they are, then they might get compared to the counter output... and lock SRAM by resetting the counter on mismatch. <s>The 8-input NAND gate smells like decoding LSBs of 21D0h/21E0h. Not sure if there&#39;s anything for decoding 21E5h.</s> Or if databus isn't used, maybe it just relies on resetting the counter, and then clocking it exactly 15 times.<br />And the WRAM chips, they have a lot of /CS and CS pins for mapping themselves anywhere to the 21xxh space, they are probably doing so, it does just depend on how that pins are wired up.<br /><br />The photographers artwork makes me shiver as usually, white background with more white background, but well, that's better than a cropped photo showing only the lower left corner of the PCB drained in flashlight and half covered by the photographers fingers. Anyways, having a photo showing the PCB back side is nice. There's really a battery on it. And, EXPAND (cart pin2) seems to be wired to GND, guess that's used to enable the I/O ports for the cdrom hardware (and to disable it when using other/game cartridges).<br /><br />I've never seen a leaking capacitor, I wouldn't say that capacitors are anywhere as dangerous as acid filled clock batteries used in Amiga's and early PC mainboards. I wouldn't replace that capacitors until/unless they stop working someday. Hmmm, with the rectangular looking package, are that electrolyt capacitors at all? Well, guess they are (going by the +/- pins).

But given your functional description, it would make sense if that signal is just the 8K RAM's /WR input.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">And the WRAM chips, they have a lot of /CS and CS pins for mapping themselves anywhere to the 21xxh space, they are probably doing so, it does just depend on how that pins are wired up.<br /></div>I've traced enough of the signals to see that they're definitely connected to the PA bus. Unfortunately, there isn't enough information to even guess about routing, let alone trace any signal other than PA7.<br /><br />(PA7 is definitely connected to pin 51)
