		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I finally found out how to trick the SF3 into letting a program running on the copier have access to all the copier memory and registers.  The SF7 "super mode" injected code directly by injecting a brk statement, and then switching the memory mapping to "bios mode" temporarily.  Instead the SF3 inserts code at every NMI.
<br />
<br />I tried my trick from before of setting the stack to a carefully chosen invalid location and it didn't work.  Also I read the NMI vector and nothing happenned.  So how does it know when to switch to bios mode?
<br />
<br />Well it is amazingly specific.  It looks to see 4 decreasing accesses to $00:0000-1FFF and <em>then</em> the NMI vector.  Normal code running on the processor can't cause this to happen, only an interrupt.
<br />
<br />However, a carefully chosen sequence of DMA can do it.  Run this code (obviously best done from RAM) and you'll switch to "BIOS" mode.
<br />
<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">&nbsp; &nbsp;LDY #$3e90<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;STY $4300&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;; &#40;B&#41; PPU -&gt; &#40;A&#41; CPU, auto decrement, read 1 reg, $213e &#40;ppu status flag&#41;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;LDY #$1F00<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;STY $4302&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;; &#40;A&#41; offset<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;LDY #$0004<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;STY $4305&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;; number of bytes to transfer<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;LDA #$00<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;STA $4304&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;; bank address = $00<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;LDY #$3e00<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;STY $4310&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;; &#40;A&#41; CPU -&gt; &#40;B&#41; PPU, auto increment, write 1 reg, $213e &#40;ppu status flag&#41;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;LDY #$FFEA<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;STY $4312&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;; &#40;A&#41; offset &#40;native mode NMI vector&#41;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;LDY #$0002<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;STY $4315&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;; number of bytes to transfer<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;LDA #$00<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;STA $4314&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;; bank address = $00<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;LDA #$03<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;STA $420B&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;;start DMA transfer<br /></div>
<br />
<br />I haven't looked around much yet.  But here's first impressions:
<br />bank $00:
<br />..$8000-$8FFF appears to be the copier registers for $40 then repeated constantly.
<br />..$9000-$FFFF ROM
<br />bank $01-03: ROM
<br />bank $04: ?? some memory
<br />bank $05: ?? same memory as $04 ??
<br />bank $06: probably copier SRAM
<br />bank $07: probably DRAM
<br />
<br />Everything else seems unmapped.
<br />Some registers probably control mapping in of the external cartridge for dumping reasons.
<br />
<br />EDIT:  Here's an example of the exploit with a memory viewer, so you can play with the copier registers.  Let me know what you find out.

<br />I seem to remember some topic on this board about ways to expand interrupt handling on the NES in which someone suggested something similar. Can anyone dig it up?

<br />
<br />Oh, good old stack manipulations <img src="./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" />
<br />Thanks neviksti, I'll try to see if this can get the setup running. We definitely need to talk more about the GDSF7, I would be intrested in exploring more of its internals! I don't know if you remember, but I emailed you about that as well.
<br />
<br />EDIT : so I guess the way of working is something like that :
<br />
<br />a) you trigger a pad crossing
<br />b) on the VBlank, the GDSF7 checks the pads and does a PLB from the stack, but being the stack pointed to *your* position, it pops *your* address from it and consequently jumps to your location.
<br />
<br />Correct?
<br />
<br />EDIT 2 : 
<br />
<br />suppose I get the reset vector of FEoEZ (which is easy) and set up a program to switch there - should work, shouldnt it?

<br />I'm sorry.  I'm not understanding what you are trying to do at all.
<br />
<br />The exploit is not needed to do any of the SPC7110 dumping.  All the dumps so far were done on the SF3 before I figured out this exploit.

<br />(tangent) Doesn't the PHA modify RAM in the SNES in a way that the game could be affected by?

<br />Yes it is possible to detect, however I don't know of any instruction that changes the databank except PLB.
<br />
<br />The only way they could have fixed it would be to map some SRAM into bank 0 and use that for their temporary stack.  The copier already has the capability to do this, so it could indeed be avoided.  But the assumption that there is room on the stack is a reasonable assumption... rarely if ever would a programmer store data literally right below the stack.
<br />
<br />EDIT: Just remembered, MVN and MVP also affect the databank register.
