<br />There are 3, 
<br />
<br />#1 is Tepples's ''FDED compressed Map editor'', But you must ask him, But one thing, he said that before you even have it: play the Tetranus(?) game on your PC.
<br />
<br />#2 is Never-Obsolete's MapEd, Which I do not like much, And will be made obsolete by Banshaku's upcoming map editor
<br />
<br />#3 is Banshaku's Untitled(?) Map Editor, It is a W.I.P. and is Unreleased, Unless it's released: Don't Ask

<br />It's called <a href="http://www.pineight.com/lj/" class="postlink">Lockjaw</a>, and no, you don't need to play it first. I'm out of the Tetris cloning business due to harassment from a Japanese licensee of The Tetris Company. The only thing you need from it is the Allegro 4.2 DLL, and that's only if you want to run the Win32 binary as opposed to compiling it yourself.
<br />
<br />Anyway, here's <a href="http://pics.pineight.com/nes/fded.zip" class="postlink">Fairydust Editor</a>. All it does is edit a 256x12 cell grid of 16x16 pixel tiles with a rudimentary run-length encoding scheme. I abandoned it when I switched to a more SMB1-style object encoding.

It wasn't very practical though. One way I used it was to convert a BMP file with map contents (from Jurassic Park) to metatile-/level data.

<br />For M.C. Kids they apparently used tUME.

<br />
<br />Unless I can find the time to finish the core and fix the remaining bugs, it would usable if you know how to avoid the bugs. In that case, I don't find that acceptable to release.  If some people like to take risk that much I could release the current alpha and list the bugs to avoid (if I can remember them!).
<br />
<br />These days I cannot even work on my nes project so I guess it will be a while before I even release it. I hope I can finish it someday.  There is no official name but for now the code name is "nes studio" since the look and feel for the windows is like visual studio.

<br />Ideally, your game engine should compute the attributes from the metatile number. Some games use a table for this; SMB1 just uses the top two bits of the metatile number.

<br />
<br />True. My engine doesn't use metatiles though, and I'm not sure if Tile Studio handles metatiles either. I guess without some major changes it's not going to be really suitable then.
<br />
<br />One day I'll change my engine to use metatiles. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />

<br />
<br />Alas no, its still a WIP for a complete game I'm working on (when I get time).. There is no Map Generator script. I just save the data out as binary and incbin it into the game. (actually, it's linked in.. yay for xorcyst)
<br />
<br />And I'd expect you to give credit if you used someone elses engine for a game.

<br />I have tried FDED. Its simplest of all the 4 options I had. But Its a very basic tool. I would like to enhance it a bit. The zip file I downloaded had the source (.C file). I think its a Win32 console program.

<br />It's an <a href="http://alleg.sf.net/" class="postlink">Allegro</a> program, and the Windows version compiles with MinGW. There are compile time options to hide the console window for an Allegro program on Windows.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />SMB1 represents each level as a list of objects,* which in turn are made of 16x16 pixel metatiles. Each metatile has a number from $00 to $FF. The level decoder spits out a 13-metatile-long buffer, which gets copied into a 32x13-metatile sliding window. A lookup table translates metatiles to four 8x8 tile numbers to write to the nametable; the top two bits of the metatile number are also used as the attribute number. Often, multiple metatiles use the same nametable tiles: both kinds of ? blocks (coin and power-up) use the ? tiles, and the "invisible block" common in <a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlatformHell" class="postlink">platform-hell level hacks</a> uses the same blank tiles as the empty cell, not to mention the <a href="http://cantbeunseen.com/what-has-been-seen/11568-the-other-cloud-in-the-pict" class="postlink">cloud-bushes that you can't unsee</a>.
