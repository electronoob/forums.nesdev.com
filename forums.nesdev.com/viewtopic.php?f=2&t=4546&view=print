		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I'm currently designing a vertically scrolling level where the player infiltrates a mountain base. The player starts at the bottom of the mountain, then works his way to the summit.
<br />
<br />Some of the sections will take place indoors, that is, inside the mountain. The base will contain elevators that allow personnel to get around easily, but due to restricted access, the player will be forced to step outside occasionally and climb the mountain exterior to proceed.
<br />
<br />To indicate the passage of time, the palette will change each time the player steps back outside for the next rock climbing segment:

<br />
<br />But getting to the point: Notice the mountain range in the background? I'd like to scroll that bad boy at a slower speed than the platforms in the foreground. It'll be a challenge but I'm pretty sure it can be done.
<br />
<br />In order to do so, I'll probably have to switch over to CHR-RAM instead of the CHR-ROM I'm currently using. Since I'm still new to NES programming, I'm not really sure how to do that. Do I just specify a different iNES header? Also, as far as modifying CHR-RAM goes, is it simply a matter of writing to the Pattern Tables?
<br />
<br />EDIT: Updated the mountain range in the background so that it repeats every 16 pixels.

CHR-RAM games (battletoads and micromachines coming to mind) had a parralax effect where tiles that weren't in the foreground all shared a common tile (or was a 16x16 layout?) that was rewritten depending on the scroll of the foreground, but nothing on the scale of this.  You want to move that entire 'layer' at it's own scroll?
<br />
<br />I think setting CHR-RAM is just setting CHR-ROM quantity in the iNES header to zero.  then you just write in $0000-$1FFF to set your tiles.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Yes, this would be quite the complicated task. Actually, Batman ROTJ comes to mind, because they had parallax with the clouds in level 1 doing things like this without manipulating the scroll. What you're doing would be a little more complicated.
<br />
<br />What I'd suggest doing is making the mountain tops as tessellated as possible, so you want have to do so much writing to CHR RAM. I'd take the mountain top "blocks" and place them side by side to make the tops of the mountains. But when scrolling horizontally I'd shift the pixels in this block left or right so that what's on one end shifts to the other end. Then these blocks that are side by side will effectively appear to scroll.
<br />
<br />Are you also scrolling vertically? This would make things more complicated, I admit. Your main concern would probably finding the time to do such updates during gameplay.

Specially considering that your mountains are randomly distributed across the horizon (i.e. there isn't a short repeating pattern).<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">In order to do so, I'll probably have to switch over to CHR-RAM instead of the CHR-ROM I'm currently using.</div><br />At first you may think so, but if you consider the amount of tiles you have to change, you'll realize that there is just not enough time to do this with CHR-RAM.<br /><br />Even if you used only 16 tiles for the mountains (which I doubt), we're talking about updating 256 bytes of pattern table data. With the fastest possible code, which is an unrolled chain of LDAs &amp; STAs (which would need 1536 bytes of ROM), each byte would take 8 cycles to copy, so 2048 cycles for all 256 bytes. That's nearly all of VBlank (there isn't even enough time for a sprite DMA).<br /><br />And that's considering you have the data buffered somewhere in RAM before VBlank starts, because if we were talking about reading-modifying-writing CHR-RAM it would take a lot more time!<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">Do I just specify a different iNES header?</div><br />As smkd said, setting the number of CHR-ROM pages to 0 should work, but some emulators refuse to see that as a valid board (as Nintendo never made a variation of NROM that used CHR-RAM), so you'd better pick an existing board such as UNROM, that has 128KB of PRG-ROM, but then you have to start worrying about PRG-ROM banks.<br /><br />Anyway, I firmly believe that the answer to you problem is not CHR-RAM. All games I can think of that used parallax effects like this used CHR-ROM, probably for the reasons I explained above.<br /><br />I advise you to keep using CHR-ROM, and do one of the following:<br /><br />1.Keep all 8 possible rotations of the mountain tiles somewhere in your pattern tables and use an optimized loop to rewrite the portions of the name tables that contain mountains. This is a big waste of CHR-ROM space, but you don't need CHR bankswitching.<br /><br />2.Have 8 different CHR-ROM banks each with a rotation of the mountain tiles, and select the appropriate one for each frame. It will only be necessary to update the name tables when the mountains complete 8 pixels of movement.<br /><br />If you had a small pattern that repeated across the screen (something between 16 and 32 pixels wide), you could get away with bankswitching only, no need to update the name tables. Many NES games did this.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">Also, as far as modifying CHR-RAM goes, is it simply a matter of writing to the Pattern Tables?</div>
<br />Yes, exactly like you write to the name tables. But like I said, it is impossible to update a large number of tiles at once, considering that you also have to update palettes, sprites and name tables.
<br />
<br />I just remembered a game that uses CHR-RAM and has parallax effects: Bee52. Check it out, maybe you'll get some ideas from it. Now that I remembered about it, it seems like it only updates one plane of the CHR data, since the clouds use a single color. It just happens that your mountains also use only one color, so you could in fact reduce the time taken to update the tiles by half, and things start to seem possible. How many tiles do your mountain use?
<br />
<br />EDIT: I just checked Bee52 and it uses 12 tiles for the clouds. The pattern is shifted to make them move, and whenever 8 pixels of movement are completed the name tables are updated. I guess you might achieve what you want with CHR-RAM if you reduce the visual complexity of the mountains.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />@tokumaru: Thank you for your wonderfully thorough response. You brought up some very important considerations. I may have to make some concessions here and there, but hearing everyone talk about how hard the effect is to pull off, I'm now <em>obligated</em> to do it. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />
<br />
<br />As for the randomness of the mountains, please disregard that. The image I posted is just a quick illustration of the concept. I'll definitely reduce the mountains to a repeating pattern of 32 pixels if not 16 pixels. Or if the mountains prove to be too troublesome, I may remove them entirely and just try to get a parallax skyline gradient.
<br />
<br />This particular level <em>only</em> scrolls vertically, so that should simplify things considerably.

<br />
<br />If it scrolls vertically (even only vertically) it's a whole lot harder. Unless you can make all foreground blocks sprites and the mountains in BG or something like that.
<br />It could probably be done by using 8 CHRROM banks, each almost the same but with the mountains scrolled to a different offset, and quickly overwrite the nametable when the scrolling changes away of 8-pixels bounariy.
<br />CHRROM would really make this feasible, for CHRRAM you'd probably have way too much stuff to updata and it would be desesperate..

<br />
<br />It's really fun looking at Metal Storm's pattern tables while playing, because it seems that all parallax effects share the same CHR-ROM banks, so you can see them all animating at once, very interesting.
<br />
<br />Oh, I just remembered of another thing to consider about parallax effects: You have to shift the graphics in the opposite direction that they appear to be moving, because you are in fact trying to cancel out some of the movement that pushed the foreground in that direction. This is not some big discovery or anything, but I still though I'd mention it, because it's interesting enough that to make something look like it's moving to the left you have to actually shift the graphics to the right.

<br />This is a really great idea. I went ahead and simplified the visual complexity of the mountains to have a fighting chance.

<br />
<br />Every time the background scrolls 1-7 pixels relative to the foreground, it would only be necessary to update a handful of tiles in CHR-RAM. Provided I update those tiles during scanlines that don't coincide with the skyline/mountains, I wouldn't even need to wait for VBlank, right?
<br />
<br />Every 8 pixels, I would update a subset of the name table, just like tokumaru said. Looking at the image above, that particular configuration would require an update of 80 name table entries; however, with some clever arrangement of the platforms, I could reduce that number by ensuring that only relatively small stretches of the skyline/mountains are exposed at any given time. Additionally, I could redraw the skyline gradient so that it's only 1 tile tall instead of 2, which would eliminate an entire row's worth of name table updates.

<br />That would require a donor cart with MMC3 or another mapper that switches CHR pages smaller than 4 KiB. The 7400 and CPLD mappers on RetroZone boards can't handle it.
<br />
<br />If you're not scrolling up and down, you can squeeze out more VRAM update time by turning off rendering eight lines early. Put sprite 0 at y=232, waiting for PPUSTATUS to register a sprite 0 hit, and then write $00 to PPUMASK. This creates a blank bar at the very bottom of the NTSC picture, which will generally fall within the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overscan" class="postlink">overscan</a>, and during the scanlines that this blank bar is present, you can write to PPUADDR/PPUDATA all you want. (But don't try to update the palette until the real vblank starts.)

<br />With CHR-ROM it would be very simple to do (only a bit wasteful, but you get nothing for nothing), and you'd just have to do update ~4 lines of nametable each 8 pixels of scrolling, which is doable with a simple unrolled loop.
<br />
<br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">That would require a donor cart with MMC3 or another mapper that switches CHR pages smaller than 4 KiB. The 7400 and CPLD mappers on RetroZone boards can't handle it. </div><br />Wrong, it would work very well with MMC1, just that you'll need to have 8 pages of 4kb containing graphics for the moutain (of 8 different pixel shifts) and blocks for that level. This could take about 64 tiles, leaving you 192 tiles for any other in-game use of the same CHR banks.<br />But it's true it would be more optimal to use MMC3 to get 1kb switching and reserve 8 1kb banks for the mountains. Also you would have no reason to reduce detail in the mountains that way, because it woudln't change anything (unless it takes a really great amount of tiles).<br />Also I guess MMC2/4 would be great for this kind of things (but donor carts are extremely rare).<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">You really wouldn't need to rewrite the nametables at all.</div>
<br />Not if scrolling horizontally, but of course yes if you scroll vetically. I guess tepples assumed you scrolled horizontally, but I guess you wanted it vertically.
<br />
<br />EDIT : Keep in mind that the number of rows that there is to update in the nametable is one more than the number of rows the graphics take. I just tought I'd mention that. Without tricks you can update 4 rows per VBlanks, so mountains/horizon graphics should take 3 rows of graphics. If you want to update more and take an extended VBlank this should be less trouble because you know in advance the fine scroll when this happens (it's always zero), saving you load of troubles. Having extended VBlank when and only when this happens could be a decent solution, as glitches would be hidded by NTSC monitors, and the VBlank is always extended on PAL so this isn't needed.
<br />
<br />If you want to avoid having to update both pattern tables and nametables, you could simply have all graphics for all 8 possible positions in a single pattern table, so you'd "only" have to update 4 rows of nametable each time you're scrolling. This would work with both CHRROM (of all sizes) and CHRRAM, but if you also need updates when scrolling the playfield you're screwed.
