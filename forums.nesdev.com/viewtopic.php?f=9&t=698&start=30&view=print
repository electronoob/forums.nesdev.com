I forget which of the 5 NES channels each side corresponds to.  Wish I could be more specific!

I was still disappointed, particularly given the price. Is there any way we could maybe pool some cash and get someone to rewire the mobo's on these things for people who already bought them?
<br />
<br />And on a different note, is there any way to mod an NES so that it has a stationary cart slot that's more reliable?

<br />Non Nintendo cartridge connectors do not require cartridge to be pushed down, I believe.  They may not be as good, contact wise, as the real cartridge connectors.

<br />
<br />You have two options, in my opinion:
<br />1.  AV version 2 modded top loader and a Famicom-to-NES cart adapter
<br />2.  AV Famicom and a NES-to-Famicom cart adapter
<br />
<br />But any NES or Famicom will have problems with old crusty carts.  So get some 99.99% pure anhydrous isopropyl alcohol (it is cheap, use google) and also get some Stabilant 22.  Clean your carts till the contacts shine, and then apply some Stabilant 22 to the edge contacts of the carts to keep them fresh.  Also store your carts with sleeves or enclosed cart cases.
<br />
<br />You can also hold your breath, like I am, and wait for kevtris's FPGA NES to be released.  Be warned, doing so will cause brain damage  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_redface.gif" alt=":oops:" title="Embarassed" />

<br />chortle.  Yah, sorry about that.  I got discouraged when I figured it'd cost more money than people would be willing to pay... for more than like 5 or 10 units (which wasn't cost-effective to make, unfortunately).
<br />
<br />As for cleaning carts, never ever use sandpaper 'cause it will remove the gold.  While the cart will work really good for awhile, it will soon crudify again and get intermittant.  Even pencil erasers are fairly abrasive and could remove some of the gold.    99% isopropyl is a reasonably good cleaner to use, and I usually buy it at the drugstore.  They sell 70% and 9x% which seems to work decent.  There's also ethyl rubbing alcohol which is pretty decent (basically everclear!).  of course, don't try to drink it- they add methyl ethyl ketone and other 'yummy' gut-turners <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":-)" title="Smile" />
<br />
<br />One trick that some enterprising people MAY want to try is pretty amusing.  Tennessee V. made a "backloading" NES out of a regular front loader and the connector out of a Game Genie... It worked really nice and the carts plugged into the BACK of the console.  He simply soldered the connector onto the pins of the NES-CPU board and cut a hole in the case.  If you try this, remember that the cart goes in upside down with the label towards the floor/bottom of the NES.

Clearly some people are willing to pay $60 for a NEX on a gamble. Maybe you could, instead of releasing a whole unit, offer to make modifications to existing machines. "I will make your famiclone WORK for $$$!" kinda thing.
<br />
<br />Well, I've contacted PlayMessiah with my concerns about the NEX and they've already responded (wierd). I've detailed them further and I'll see which way they go. If I end up returning this thing I'll just buy a replacement slot for my NES.
<br />
<br />Any reason my NES, with a good adapter, couldn't play any famicom game I throw at it?

<br />I ended up writing that, and it's not all that bad of a design. However, shortly after I put up that article, I found out that the U-connector is now for sale, which really would have removed the need for cutting a hole and soldering the connector so that it points out the back. Of course, you stil need to push the games down, but at least the console is intact at that point.
<br />
<br />Another benefit of the U-connector is that to replace it, you only need to remove the case screws - the U-connector simply slides on, nothing to remove from the board itself.

<br />
<br />The FPGA NES tries to accomplish everything at once, and this comes with a high monetary cost. What the world needs now is simpler: a highly accurate, optimized, inexpensive to mass produce glop-top ASIC based NOAC.  The FPGA NES can come at a later time, when FPGA IC costs are lower.  The question is, is it possible to make such a glop-top ASIC based NOAC?  Both cheap and accurate?  Any interest in doing that?  It would help put an end to sh*tty NOAC based clones, as all of these pirates would just use the accurate NOAC instead, assuming it could be produced for the same cost.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />On all the Famicom carts I've encountered with audio in/out. They just raise the impedance with a resistors, mix the audio channel(s) from the mapper chip, then back out pin 46.
<br />
<br />A simple solution to mod the NEX,
<br />just find the audio out, and mix the audio signals with 2 resistors.
<br />
<br />If there is a buffering transistor on the audio out on the NEX, (probably an emitter follower) put the signal right before that. You will need to cut the trace to it. Tie pin 46 of the Famicom output to one leg of the trim pot, and the output of the 2A03 to the other leg (right before the buffering transistor). Then tie the wiper of the trimpot to the base of the transistor. You may need a cap in series with pin 46, due to the DC offset of some carts.

<br />
<br />I've mentioned this in other forums, and it has worked like a dream for me for years.  If you buy a 72 pin connector, attach the side that the cart normally goes in to the motherboard and use the side that the motherboard usually uses for the carts.  Yes, you've gotta hack the plastic "wings"  off the connector first.
<br />
<br />See this pic:
<br />
<br /><a href="http://img58.imageshack.us/my.php?image=72pinnesmod1sm.jpg" class="postlink"><img src="http://img58.imageshack.us/img58/9605/72pinnesmod1sm.th.jpg" alt="Image" /></a>
<br />
<br />Note the two raised screws to keep the connector from sliding back.  The two pennies are there to keep the zif side pressed against the motherboard.  This has worked perfectlty for me for years now.  All it costs is the price of a 72 pin connector + 2 cents.

<br />Yah, something like that... He did the mod 5 or so years ago though.  
<br />
<br />Anyways, I can't really make just a couple of these consoles 'cause of setup and tooling costs.  I'd cost me around $800 to $1500 to get the board stuffers "set up" to make the boards... they have to program their machines to place all the surface mount components.  Also, there is the cost of getting the two solder paste stencils made, and then the boards made (setup charges there too) and then the cost of actually running the boards (more $$$)
<br />
<br />And then of course buying the parts too... that will cost alot of money too.  I obviously can't "float" the project myself on the hope that someone will actually buy them to pay for the cost of making them.  I put alot of work into this thing, and at this point I will have to put alot more work into it just to get them made... and by the time I do I won't have made a single cent on the project.  I'm not looking to get rich or anything, but it'd be pretty frustrating having thousands of dollars pass through my hands, and I don't get to keep a single cent of it, even though I worked hundreds of hours on the project.
<br />
<br />Anyways, the cost of the chip DID go down... it's now something like $30 which is pretty reasonable IMO.  I was looking at a USB host chip that you can get for $7 too... it was pretty neat; it might be a way to interface with controllers, harddrives, and memory keys without having to buy expensive connectors and stuff.  That would vastly reduce the price of this console and reduce chip count and size something fierce.  The only thing is it would need to have alot of software written.   Just having 4 USB ports on the thing would make life alot simpler for sure.  That'd allow keyboards, controllers, memory cards, and a connection to a host PC without too much problem so long as the software to control it could be written.
<br />
<br />So, the whole idea isn't dead yet... just kinda on the back burner while I try to figure out how to make it cheaper and smaller and better.
