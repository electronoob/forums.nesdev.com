I guess a low priority sprite could be used to color in the knights &quot;belt&quot; which would add a little more color, and then let that sprite disappear first if there are too many sprites on that scanline. If I recall correctly that's what they do with the eyes in SMB2.<br /><br />If someone was to do an actual port of the game to NES hardware, I think everything would have to be shrunk down for better playability, or just live with it all being very flickery.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />@estlib:  I really like the colors and style.  What is it for?<br /><br />@jayminer:  The entire game would have to be re-designed to work optimally on the NES.  Flicker is one of the hard limits of the NES, and there's only so much you can do to work around it.  Maybe flicker could just be standard with the port, preferably the 'blink in and out of existence' kind like Recca's, not the 'temporarily not draw a sprite until it is out of the line' like Bubble Bobble's.

The game of contrast between colors &amp; black is the entire artistic idea behind the game idea. there does exist a standing sprite of the &quot;NES Vectorman&quot; but its way too big for anything else to exist on the screen (see attachment).<br /><div class="attachtitle">Attachment:</div><div class="attachcontent">
