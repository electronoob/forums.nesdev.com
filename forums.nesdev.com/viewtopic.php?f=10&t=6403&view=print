<br />
<br />It's how the status flags are set after a cmp. I used to that for a while until I memorized it. It's probably covered in the link by tokumaru, but this is a quick reference.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Also, if you're comparing signed numbers, I find it's best and less confusing to flip the sign bit of each value being compared before comparing them, and then you can just compare them like unsigned numbers. For example, compare these two values:
<br />
<br />A - $B0
<br />B - $40
<br />
<br />When working with signed numbers, $B0 is actually a negative value, and $40 is not. It's obvious then than $B0 should read as less than $40, but when working with unsigned comparisons, $B0 reads as greater than $40. But if you flip the sign bits:
<br />
<br />A - $30
<br />B - $C0
<br />
<br />$30 would read as less than $C0 in an unsigned comparison. I've never understood how to do signed comparisons using BVC/BVS, but I seem to remember it taking about the same amount of cycles as the bit flipping technique.

<br />That's because those aren't for comparing numbers, they're for detecting wrapping in signed operations. When comparing signed numbers you should use BMI/BPL.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />BMI and BPL don't work for comparing signed values either, as they don't tell you when the internal subtraction CMP performs overflows. For example, comparing -2 with +127 clears the sign flag, but comparing -1 with +127 sets the sign flag, even though the relation is the same for both, less-than. There's no way to directly compare signed values with CMP and have the greater/less result in the flags. As Celius said, the simplest way is to convert signed to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Offset_binary" class="postlink">offset binary</a> (EOR both values with $80, which can often be done during assembly as one is usually a constant somewhere), then do a normal (unsigned) comparison and examine the carry flag. Some 65xx books I've read suggest instead using SBC for signed values, then interpreting the carry <em>and</em> overflow flags, but this is inferior to converting to offset binary.

<br />Which reminds me, the AVR MCUs has a S flag (sign flag) that is ALWAYS equal to V xor N, so even when there's an overflow the sign information is preserved and the comparison can still be valid.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Interesting; so you're saying the S flag on the AVR matches the value it would have if both operands were sign-extended one extra bit, added, and then this extra bit put into the S bit? Some of the 65xx books I've been reading lately mention this operation, where you add two signed values, and then want to know whether the result can be represented, or it overflowed and you need to extend precision by one bit and determine what the value of this new bit should be.

<br />Yes. Example: r16 holds the value -128 ($80) and you're doing cpi r16,1 (compare register with immediate value) then N is cleared (the thrown away result is 127) BUT the overflow is set, so  S = N ^ V, S is still set so the branch testing the S flag is unaffected by this behavior.

<br />
<br />Yeah basicly CMP is Register-Number, Then sets the zero flag according to if it is zero or not. hence why your next instruction is usually BEQ or BNE  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_cool.gif" alt="8)" title="Cool" />
