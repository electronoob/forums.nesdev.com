<br />
<br />It can be assumed that downsampling takes place within the filter module because he doesn't need 21 MHz output / components up to 10.5 MHz. Conveniently this can be implemented with little more than a counter, single MAC and 256 word ROM for the coefficients.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Yeah, nothing you said makes sense.  Sorry to be blunt.  Please don't take that the wrong way either - I'm not saying your "dumb" or any silliness like that.  You have actually helped me out a lot in the past.  I would just say to study up on FFTs, the Nyquist-Shannon theorem, and implement a couple working FIR filters yourself in HDL and Matlab and then come back if you still want to discuss.  But thanks for trying to help!
<br />
<br />Anyway, I already spoke to Kevtris at length about this again yesterday on IRC and he verified that with the information that I have (which I posted in detail here) the filter definitely would not work (very bad aliasing would occur).  He just said that it's been 7 years so he doesn't remember exactly what he did.  And he doesn't want to look at his source because that would make the mystery too easily solved. Lol. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />
<br />
<br />I also spoke to a few DSP engineers at work and the filter would not even remotely work as described (again aliasing). And my understanding of Kevtris' description/supposed-implementation was accurate (as confirmed with him yesteday on IRC).  The fact is he just doesn't remember everything that he did. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />
<br />
<br />I have a working low-pass FIR filter already but it requires more than one multiplier. Which is fine, it just takes a bit longer to implement.  I'm trying to bribe Kevtris to take a look at his source and figure out what he did.  Hehe, we'll see what happens. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" />

<br />Yep, you are correct.  The coefficients for this particular application are always symmetric so I actually only require N/2 multipliers where N is the number of taps (this is referred to as a "folded" FIR btw).  So my implementation is not a pure linear FIR requiring one per sample.  But still, N/2 multipliers is not as good as 1 multiplier - which is why I'm on a mission to figure out how Kevtris got away with it. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" />

<br />Somebody care to explain what is wrong with what kyuusaku is saying? I can't see anything wrong with it.
<br />
<br />Input sample rate is 21.47 MHz, multiply input samples with coefficients and accumulate for 256 cycles (needing only one hardware multiplier) and we have one filtered result sample at ~83KHz sampling rate. So we're basically only calculating the filter output y[n] at y[255], y[511], y[767], etc.
<br />
<br />I'm not sure how well 256 taps would work though when the sample rate is so high compared to the cutoff frequency.

<br />That's def a great idea. And myself and one of the DSP guys at work actually tested that a short while back.  It does help reduce the number of multipliers but not as much as one might think.  After looking at the various frequency responses of both 2-stage and 3-stage filter implementations in matlab we concluded that there was no significant advantage over a single-stage.  Actually, I concluded that a single stage was overall more advantageous since the HDL implementation was much less complex and less error prone. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /> Hehe.

To answer your question this implementation is not possible on either mine or Kevtris' hardware.  The reason is because if your filter's sample rate is 21MHz with only one multiply-accumulate core, then you must run the MAC operation at 21MHz*256 (i.e. 5Ghz!!) in order to calculate the filtered result before the next sample is shifted in on the next 21MHz clock cycle.  This is simply not possible on any FPGA in existence. Lol. Hope that clears things up.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">thefox wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">I'm not sure how well 256 taps would work though when the sample rate is so high compared to the cutoff frequency.</div>
<br />Yep, you're right.  The response totally sux - as can be see <a href="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/36237540/kevtris_response.PNG" class="postlink">here</a>.  At -45db the 256-tap frequency is wayyyy out near 200kHz. Lol.  You would literally needs *thousands* of coefficients to reach the desired cutoff of 20kHz.  This is just another of many reasons that Kevtris' filter will not work as described.

<br />
<br />I took your advice jwdonal and worked out the hardware for a traditional FIR (single-multiplier). Now I understand your conclusion about aliasing, I guess didn't read your post carefully enough either time; nevermind DSP, big posts are hard to follow. What I needed was a reminder of n MAC units / n iterations / n taps = a single MAC implementation effectively must be downsampling at the input. The obvious solution to this problem: reduce the filter order... I really doubt 19th order would be all that bad.

<br />Okay, I think I see what you're saying.  What you're describing is not a FIR filter in any form.  The reason being because there is no convolution involved, that is, the "sliding window" of samples being shifted in each clock cycle does not exist - hence there can be no convolution.  I have no idea what kind of filter that is and one of my DSP friends at my job didn't know either.  I also tried googling it (not really knowing what to call it) and didn't come up with anything.
<br />
<br />In any case, I can try this out and see what happens.  It would be incredibly interesting if it worked.  If it did work, then the mis-information that Kevtris gave me was in telling me that he implemented a "FIR" filter when he actually didn't.  I will let you know what happens after I try it...might not be for a couple days though.

<br />You're saying Wikipedia's explanation of FIR is wrong?
<br />
<br /><img src="http://thefox.aspekt.fi/fir.png" alt="Image" />
<br />(x = input, y = output, b = coefficients, N = filter order)
<br />
<br />Filter output is only dependent on N+1 previous input samples. So we can calculate output at y[255] using x[0]..x[255], y[511] using x[256]..x[511] and so on. As long as the ratio we're downsampling by in the end is the same as the number of taps we don't need to process any of the input samples more than once.

<br />No, but you also need to read it more carefully. And I also wouldn't rely entirely on Wikipedia for an in-depth explanation of FIR filters. Lol.  Wikipedia says: "The top part is an N-stage delay line...".  The Wiki doesn't go into detail but the key words there are "delay line".  That is, you don't take N new samples at a time, rather you take *1* new sample at a time by shifting in a new sample into the delay chain on each clock cycle.  I would go check out some other sites or maybe those old dusty things that no one uses anymore called "books".  Hehe. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" />
<br />
<br />The number of samples that go into a FIR filter is _always_ equal to the number of samples that come out of the FIR filter.  Consider the following (completely plausible) FIR filter design scenario:
<br />
<br />- The input to the FIR filter is a continuous set of 256-sample digital waveforms.
<br />- The FIR filter is a 256-tap low-pass filter.
<br />
<br />With your implementation you would only get one sample out of your filter for each waveform. LOL. That is not a waveform.  On the other hand, with a proper FIR filter using a delay chain you would always get a filtered 256-sample waveform (this is the "convolution" process) on the output.
<br />
<br />Now, with that said, you can perform "decimation" on the *output* of the FIR filter - which drops samples.  Or you can perform "down-sampling" on the samples _before_ they are input to the FIR which also removes samples. But either way, the number of samples into the FIR is always equal to the number of samples out.
<br />
<br />So, again, what you are describing is _not_ a FIR filter. Period.
<br />
<br />Here are some more sites to educate you on FIR filter operations/calculations/convolution:

<br />
<br />You've managed to really confuse yourself. A unified FIR-and-decimate object IS valid, despite your insistance that it's not. The thing thefox is describing is exactly what I said earlier: You only need to run the FIR filter for each OUTPUT sample. After all, if the decimation just throws away the results for most of the previous FIR results, why calculate them at all?

<br />Haha.  Negative.  What I said was that what was being described was not a FIR.  And I'm right.  What you're describing is what you've coined as a "unified FIR-and-decimate".
<br />
<br />"Unified FIR-and-decimate" != "FIR"
<br />
<br />In other words, if a customer at my job asked me to code up a FIR filter I would not provide them with this "unified FIR-and-decimate" filter that you have described. Because that's not what they're asking for.
<br />
<br />And I still don't think that I agree with the term "unified FIR-and-decimate" but it doesn't matter.  I will definitely try out this filter that you have described and if it works I will be extremely happy and will happily let everyone know that it works.  And I will have learned something new.  If it doesn't work then nothing has been lost.  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />
<br />
<br />Again, I realize that you guys are trying to help and _please_ understand that I truly appreciate that.  I'm just trying to explain the reasoning behind my thoughts.
