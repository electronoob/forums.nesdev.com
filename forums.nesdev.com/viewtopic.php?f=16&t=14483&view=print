		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />So, the Wiki has an extention that allows RC patrollers to &quot;hide&quot; edits from the recent changes timeline by marking them as bot edits. This is useful for keeping Spam rollbacks from cluttering the view. I was interested in using this feature to help revert spam, but until today I was under the impression that only administrators (i.e. tepples) could do it. As it turns out, I have had the ability to do it for a long time, but the Wiki has just been incorrectly hiding this feature from me (and presumably most others).<br /><br />The feature works, and is available to 100+ edit users at: <a href="http://wiki.nesdev.com/w/index.php/Special:RecentChangesCleanup" class="postlink">Special:RecentChangesCleanup</a><br />Documentation here: <a href="https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Extension:Recent_Changes_Cleanup" class="postlink">https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Extension:Recent_Changes_Cleanup</a><br /><br />However, the extension seems to be failing to appear on pages for such users. It should apparently have a link appear on <a href="http://wiki.nesdev.com/w/index.php/Special:SpecialPages" class="postlink">Special:SpecialPages</a> and <a href="http://wiki.nesdev.com/w/index.php/Special:RecentChanges" class="postlink">Special:RecentChanges</a>, but this does not seem to appear for anyone but administrators?<br /><br />This question came up in a recent unrelated thread: <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/viewtopic.php?f=13&amp;t=14474&amp;start=15#p174654" class="postlink">http://forums.nesdev.com/viewtopic.php?f=13&amp;t=14474&amp;start=15#p174654</a><br />Koitsu proposed some guesses about the cause: <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/viewtopic.php?f=13&amp;t=14474&amp;start=15#p174668" class="postlink">http://forums.nesdev.com/viewtopic.php?f=13&amp;t=14474&amp;start=15#p174668</a>

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Looks like we can rule out &quot;old version&quot; as a possibility: version 1.3 is being used per: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://wiki.nesdev.com/w/index.php/Special:Version">http://wiki.nesdev.com/w/index.php/Special:Version</a><!-- m --><br /><br />It makes me wonder if maybe a different constructor name is being used than what the docs specify.  I started digging <a href="https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Manual:Special_pages" class="postlink">into MediaWiki's SpecialPages documentation</a> (a perfect example of how utterly disorganised and chaotic wikis are) and found the <a href="https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Manual:Special_pages#Restricting_page_access" class="postlink">Restricting page access</a> section possibly relevant.<br /><br />The only other thing I can think of is that the docs say the entry in the SpecialPages area won't show up for someone unless they've done at least 100 edits.  I'd like to think Rainwarrior has, but still:<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">* Sysops and users will see a special page at the bottom &quot;Other special pages&quot; section called &quot;Recent Changes Cleanup&quot;. ...<br />* Currently, any user with at least 100 edits is able to access this page (the number 100 can be edited in the file &quot;RecentChangesCleanup_body.php&quot;). This should not be a concern because if an editor has at least 100 edits, they are most likely &quot;safe&quot; and will not abuse the system. In any case this only hides a line in the RC so its not a serious issue. If you have problems with this, you can change the number to a higher number.</div><br />(Off-topic: if the &gt;=100 number turns out to be the cause for the extension not showing up in SpecialPages, then lowering it to a more sane value also concerns me: would spammers posting tons of crap on Talk pages classify as an Edit?  AFAIK talk page chatter on MediaWiki is done *exactly* like an Edit, so uh, this feature seems like it would make the RecentChangesCleanup option available to spammers, no?  Maybe the user rights trump that.  I don't know.  Welcome to the importance of clear/concise documentation!)<br /><br />I also can't figure out how to submit PRs/issues/support requests to the author of the RecentChangesCleanup extension.  There's apparently two authors (one named &quot;Anon&quot; (wonderful...), the other &quot;Choshi&quot;), and there's no Talk page for that extension, so I'm at a loss there.

Consider the last &quot;mass spam&quot; we had on there -- how many edits and talk pages was that?  It surely was in, or nearing, the 3-digit range.

I meant a spammer editing the wiki without logging in. Contributions from contributors who are not logged in are marked with the contributor's IP address. (See <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:IP" class="postlink">WP:IP</a>.)

Thus only logged-in users are allowed to use RCC.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">koitsu wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">Consider the last &quot;mass spam&quot; we had on there -- how many edits and talk pages was that?  It surely was in, or nearing, the 3-digit range.</div><br />The last mass spam was by 199.15.233.162, almost exactly a month ago. Because 199.15.233.162 is an IP address, not a logged-in user, it has 0 edit count ergo no RCC access.<br /><br /><br />P.S.: I'm not in the habit of using the term &quot;intellectual property&quot; due to confusion. See <a href="https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/not-ipr.html" class="postlink">Richard Stallman's article</a>, <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20080306/003240458/if-intellectual-property-is-neither-intellectual-property-what-is-it.shtml" class="postlink">Mike Masnick's article</a>, and <a href="https://pineight.com/mw/index.php?title=Intellectual_property" class="postlink">my article full of backronyms</a>.
