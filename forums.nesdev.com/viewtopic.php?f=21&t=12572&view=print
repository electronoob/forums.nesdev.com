		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Hey. Been working away on a wee platformer thing using Construct 2. I have no coding skills whatsoever, I just enjoy messing with the oul' pixels. I love the look of NES games. Love all the blacks n' the chunky low resolution. I wanted to emulate that, but not stick 100% within the NES's limits. Was wondering what a group of NES experts thought of how my game's coming along so far. Any crits, comments or suggestions would be greatly appreciated.

I sure will keep you updated!<br /><br />The temptation to break the 4 colour sprite limit was so strong, but I managed to stick to it. His sword is an extra colour, but that's a separate sprite that I'll swap out for different weapons.<br /><br />So I can actually just upload images to the site, eh? That's handy. I'll swap the image over then.

Right now, I can't really tell where the limbs end and the hands/feet begin.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />There's also the fact that the foreground can't contain slopes or other complex shapes, or the places where background and foreground meet can look weird. The Battletoads example actually has a pretty complex foreground, but they compensate by making the background less detailed. The edges still look a little weird though. Battletoads also uses free two-dimensional scrolling, but the background pattern is small enough for it not to be a problem. And the game uses CHR-RAM, so it doesn't have to store all possible rotations of the background, they can be calculated in real time.
