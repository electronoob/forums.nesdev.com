		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Hi,
<br />
<br />The one bus feature of some FC-on-a-chip ICs allows both PRG and CHR data to be contained in a single ROM. E.g. see <a href="http://nesdev.com/bbs/viewtopic.php?t=5222" class="postlink">this thread</a>.
<br />
<br />Some cartridges are designed for use in one-bus-compatible consoles and therefore don't work in a real Famicom. The one-bus-compatible FC clone console I have works with both normal and one-bus cartridges.
<br />
<br />I'm wondering, is the pinout for one-bus cartridges standardised? From memory, the carts supplied with the Power Joy Supermax are also the one-bus type. Is it possible to dump one-bus cartridges using e.g. a CopyNES or other hardware, without needing to desolder the ROM?
<br />
<br />I have uploaded some pics of an AT-103 101-in-1 one-bus cartridge and its PCB:
<br /><a href="http://www.fileserve.com/file/CPWvRpP/AT-103_pics_mark_k.tar" class="postlink"><strong>File name: AT-103_pics_mark_k.tar File size: 1.66 MB</strong></a>
<br />
<br />The AT-103 cart was originally bundled with an "Arcade Action II" console. Someone has dumped that cart already; see <a href="http://cah4e3.shedevr.org.ru/dumping_2010.php" class="postlink">http://cah4e3.shedevr.org.ru/dumping_2010.php</a>. Oddly, I have a 118-in-1 cartridge AT-207 which is probably made by the same manufacturer, but is not one-bus-specific; it works fine in a real Famicom.
<br />
<br />Edit: for a quicker way to view the pictures try <a href="http://imgur.com/a/H1miM" class="postlink">here</a>.
<br />Edit 2: I found another AT-103 cartridge, in a different style case but using the same PCB (with one jumper configured differently). Pics of that <a href="http://imgur.com/a/EfyKz" class="postlink">here</a>.

<br />
<br />
<br />The only thing I can imagine is the clone has built in CHR ram and all the games are UNROM like.  So it wouldn't be that it combined the busses, it just built the needed CHR bus hardware onto the console vice the cart.
<br />
<br />This is just speculation but only thing that really makes sense.
<br />
<br />If this is really the case then I would imagine you could dump it with the copyNES or any dumper if you had the proper dumping script for however the mapper is set up.
<br />
<br />Really regardless of how the busses are set up there has got to be some way to dump it, you just have to know how the cart works.  I'll download the photos and take a look when I get home.

<br />
<br />I'm also sufficiently confused what they are doing here.  I didn't really attempt to follow any traces anywhere.  But it looks like they mainly didn't use the upper address bits of CHR.  They used the lower byte and the CHR data bus.  They did NOT use CHR /A13 (/CE) either though.  They must have something like 256Byte CHR bankswitching???
<br />
<br />Nothing abnormal on the PRG side of the house.
<br />
<br />What is it that makes you say they only use a single rom?  That glob top has 40 "leads"  So it would appear to me that they are just using half of the available CHR bus but still using it none the less, and it's kept separate from the PRG bus.  
<br />
<br />Keep in mind you can put whatever you want in a single glob top.  There could easily be two separate "roms" and the mapper must be in there as well.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />The cartridge is designed for consoles which use the "one bus" system. I'm guessing the console uses a V.R. Technology VT02. You can read the datasheet for that which includes info on the one-bus system at <a href="http://vrt.com.tw/datasheet.php" class="postlink">http://vrt.com.tw/datasheet.php</a>.
<br />
<br />I also noticed the audio in &amp; out pins are not connected, so the console which the cartridge is meant for presumably doesn't support in-cart sound hardware.
<br />
<br />From the datasheet it looks like one-bus ROM address lines [24:15] correspond to PPU address lines [9:0]. What I'd like to figure out is how the console determines whether to enable one-bus mode. Could it be something lame like having the XONEBUS pin (which is active high) connected via a pullup resistor to Vcc, the trace from XONEBUS going to the audio in/out pin on the cart connector, and the trace from the other audio pin going to GND? (Then one-bus mode would only be enabled when the audio in &amp; out pins aren't connected, which would allow normal Famicom carts without sound hardware to work normally.)
<br />
<br />Given how one-bus mode operates, would it in theory be possible to dump the data from this cart using e.g. a CopyNES? You'd have to ensure the values on the PPU address lines are stable while reading 32KB of PRG data from 0x8000-0xFFFF. If that's possible...

<br />- 2 and 52 are tied together. Either 2 or 52 (most probably) is A24. The other may be used for Onebus detection
<br />- I'm unsure if it's standarized or not. If it really uses a VT02 it must follow the same pinout

<br />
<br />If you're looking to track down the pinouts I would recommend using a multimeter so you can follow traces out of view.  Also you might get a few hints from the FC pinout since they appear to be following some patterns there.
<br />
<br />What is this compared to the other pictures you linked to before because there are different pictures.   Similar but different game/cart I'm guessing?  The original pictures you posted didn't even have a pad layout for a TSOP flash.
<br />
<br />I'm still curious what it is that makes you say that clone allows both CHR and PRG data to be contained on the same ROM.  (and not in a UNROM fashion)  I still haven't seen any proof of this, but I haven't read any data sheets or anything mind you, I'm only going off your pictures.

<br />
<br />I guess your cart PCB was designed to accept either TSOP flash or chip-on-board ROM. Probably the solder pads need to be bridged differently depending on the type of chip used.
<br />
<br />Looking at your pinout, CHR data lines 0-2 and 4-7 correspond to ROM data bus lines D8-D10 and D12-D15. That matches the info in the VT02 datasheet for 16-bit ROM mode. However, in your pinout pin 50 (normally CHR A7) is connected to D11 of the ROM. I would have expected cartridge connector pin 29 (normally CHR D3) to be connected to ROM D11.
<br />
<br />Do the silk-screened names on your cart board correspond to the normal cart pinout? VA3, VA4, VA7, VA8, VA9 could refer to CHR address lines, and VD7 to CHR data line 7. The pairs of solder pads marked JA and JB could maybe be set differently if the ROM is to be used in 8-bit mode???
<br />
<br />Thinking about it some more, the silk-screening on your board probably means this. The numbers refer to pin numbers of the ROM (not the TSOP). So for example, pin 33 of the ROM can be connected to VA9, GND or Vcc depending on which pair of solder pads is bridged. And ROM pin 1 can be connected to either Vcc or VA7 depending on which pair of pads are bridged.
<br />
<br />Another thing to be figured out is how the console determines whether 16-bit ROM mode is used.

<br />ROM pin 31 can be connected to A0 or VD7 (= D15)??? Maybe those jumpers are set differently if an 8-bit ROM is used???
<br />
<br />ROM pin 33 can be connected to VA9 (= A24), GND or Vcc. Vcc on your board.
<br />ROM pin 32 can be connected to VA8 (= A23) or GND. VA8 on your board.
<br />ROM pin  1 can be connected to VA7 (= A22) or Vcc. VA7 on your board.
<br />ROM pin 44 can be connected to VA6 (= A21) or Vcc. VA6 on your board.
<br />ROM pin 43 can be connected to VA5 (= A20) or Vcc. It looks like a trace on the board connects it to VA5.
<br />ROM pin  2 can be connected to VA4 (= A19) or Vcc. Not clear from the pic, it looks like a trace connects it to VA4.
<br />ROM pin  3 can be connected to VA3 (= A18) or Vcc. Looks like a trace connects it to VA3.
<br />
<br />The other jumpers would be used differently depending on the ROM capacity. Since A24 is tied to Vcc on your board, your ROM capacity is probably 16Mbytes. Also, it might be possible for the manufacturer to make one large-capacity ROM, and produce multiple different cartridges using it by setting jumper options differently.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Okay, well from looking at the <a href="http://nesdev.com/bbs/viewtopic.php?p=85525" class="postlink">Messiah Generation NEX schematic</a> it's fairly clear how that console operates.
<br />
<br />I still need to open up my one-bus-compatible Arcade Action II console to check whether it's wired similarly to the NEX. (My console is branded Arcade Action II on top, the label underneath says it's an Argo UT-60. Note that earlier UT-60 consoles are not one-bus-compatible, so they probably use a different NOAC.)
<br />
<br />Most NES <em>cartridge</em> boards connect pins 57 (CIRAM /CE) and 58 (CHR /A13) of the cart connector. Similarly most Famicom carts connect pins 48 and 49. (Games which use 4-screen mirroring or MMC5 <em>don't</em> just connect those pins together, which explains why the clone consoles fail with those games.)
<br />
<br />The NEX schematic shows pin 57 of the cart connector is grounded, and pin 58 connects to the NOAC ONEBUS pin (as well as the audio output circuitry, meaning that the VT03's second APU is only enabled in one-bus mode).
<br />
<br />The result is that with most cartridges, because they connect pins 57 and 58, the ONEBUS pin is grounded, disabling one-bus mode when a cart is inserted. (A little note: the NEX schematic has transposed the pin numbers for the NES connector. So what are in reality pins 57 and 58 are shown as pins 21 and 22 on the schematic.)
<br />
<br />Looking at both my AT-103 cart board and the board that socram8888 posted, pins 57 and 58 are unconnected. So consoles designed similarly to the NEX will operate in one-bus mode with those cartridges. And if connected to a real Famicom or NES, apart from the one-bus issue, the console's VRAM is disabled.
<br />
<br />Again from the NEX schematic, it looks like the XD16BUSB pin of the VT03 is left open. Assuming the schematic reflects the layout of actual NEX consoles, that means 16-bit ROM mode is always disabled with the NEX. So it may be that the NEX would not be compatible with my one-bus cartridge. (I'm not certain though; it may be that the AT-103 cart PCB can be configured to work in 16-bit-ROM mode, but my cartridge isn't set up/jumpered for that.)

<br />
<br />Are you able to upload higher-res pics of the board? It looks like that cart is doing something with the audio in line (pin 46, audio from cart to console's audio output).
<br />
<br />socram8888: Thanks. So the NEX operates either in normal 8-bit NES/FC-compatible mode, or in one-bus mode with 16-bit ROM.
<br />
<br />Another console which seems to use one-bus-like cartridges is the MiWi. That's a "16-bit" console, so probably not directly compatible with normal Famicom carts. But if you look at the cart board pictures, you'll notice their layout is <strong>very</strong> similar to the pic that socram8888 uploaded. <a href="http://imgur.com/a/H5z0M" class="postlink">Pics here</a>. So if we somehow get the capability to easily dump one-bus cartridges, carts for consoles like the MiWi should be dumpable the same way.
