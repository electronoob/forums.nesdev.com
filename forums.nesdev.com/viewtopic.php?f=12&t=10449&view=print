That system's connector has all pins present (for Super FX games) and mounting holes which was a nice surprise. Not great quality, but easily available and not hard to desolder.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />The notches are following the 2.5mm grid, too? Yes, looks like so: Each notch equals to 2 missing pins (or 4 missing pins for both notches).<br />If you feel like slaughtering hardware: SNES PAL/NTSC/EUR/US/JP region adaptors might be also a good choice (they do usually even have 2 cartridge slots, I have a WINGS adaptor around with 2 slots and full pinouts, but that may vary from adaptor to adaptor).<br />Outside of the SNES (and NES) world, 2.5mm should be hard to find, most normal connectors (like ISA-bus) are using 2.54mm pitch.

Any differences in the jump from the middle section to the 2 Expansion sections (the gap), or does it maintain the same pitch? I actually don't have accurate measuring tools for this at home.</div><br /><br />The correct pitch is 2.50mm, the socket I linked is 2.54mm.  By the time you get to the edge of the socket, you end up with 0.68mm offset, which, while not insignificant, also isn't actually problematic if the cart is centered.  Or, if you're not concerned with the expansion pins it's only 0.44mm offset at the very edge of the main set of contacts, which is basically 99% guaranteed to still line up fine for all of the pins.  Yes, it gets close the further out to the edge you get, but it is possible to insert a cart and have every pin make contact with 0 shorts, I've tested that and confirmed it several times.  Also, I've never had a single problem with a normal cart, haven't really tested with an expansion cart other than SMRPG, which hasn't worked, but I suspect that has more to do with the SA-1 CIC than the socket.  If in doubt, slide the cart so that the edge with pin 1 is pressed tightly to the edge of the socket, since IIRC the only signals they actually used on the cart expansion pins were the 21.477MHz cklock signal, /WRAM, and REFRESH, all of which are on the same side.  There isn't much harm in shorting the expansion address pins together, or shorting them to the audio pins, since the address lines are open drain.<br /><br />That really is the best socket you're going to find currently in production, I've looked high and low, and 2.50mm pitch just isn't something you can get your hands on.  So, as others have mentioned, your best bet may be a clone console, or a dead console (that's what I'm going to be using once I finalize my wire-wrapped hardware design and get around to redoing it on a PCB, Ebay has a lot of dead SNES consoles pretty cheap).
