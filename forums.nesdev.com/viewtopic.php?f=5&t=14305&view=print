(to darryl.revok)<br />Also, have you considered a different race/ethnicity/gender for your players? I think in 2016, correcting the dominance of white male protagonists in NES games should be taken into consideration.</div><br /><br />I take issue with adding diversity merely for diversity sake. I feel like if I were playing a game made in ...let's say, Africa... and they added a 'whitey' character, merely as a marketing tactic, I would feel more offended than grateful.<br /><br />I do agree that women protagonists are underrepresented, but merely slapping a last-minute... 'Oh, you can also play as the girl' feels kind of like a cheat. Especially in this genre.<br /><br />Makes me think of an episode of Futurama, when they were watching a robot soap opera, and it had one token 'human' on the show.</div><br /><br />Regardless, I don't feel that &quot;main character&quot; needs a compelling reason to not be a white male, nor do I feel that a person must be a member of an ethnic group to represent them in fiction. Just because you don't happen to be of a particular group, doesn't mean that persons of that group won't play your games.<br /><br />Moreover, how does having a female soldier feel like <em>a cheat</em> in a world where most modern countries permit women soldiers?<br /><br />There's also a difference between adding a &quot;whitey&quot; character&quot; and representing multiple ethnicities without stereotype.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Speaking purely about Run and Gun, I don't think there's anything wrong with both characters being men in a game that is ostensibly a 80's male power fantasy. I also don't see fault with one or both of them being white since it draws a lot from Rambo.<br /><br />As for games in general, I think that a well-rounded cast is a good idea in every situation that allows for it. Playing The Simpsons Hit and Run just yesterday it struck me as odd that all the characters that appear (with one exception) are the typical yellow (white) character. Granted, most of the characters in the show are yellow (white) but some are not and none of the extra actors in game reflected this. I wasn't exactly offended or anything but it did strike me as odd or even inappropriate.<br /><br />But that's about as far as I think any diversity should be concerned. The gameplay drives the plot, the plot drives the setting, and the setting drives the character's biological identities. If I play a game set in modern day New York then I expect there to be a wide range of colors. If I play a game set in a fantasy world full of european architectue I expect fantasy-european characters. If a game is set in India, the majority of the cast should probably be Indian. Any aspect of the setting that stands out for no in-game reason is a failure no matter what politics are involved. <br /><br />And of course it should go without saying that all of the above is my opinion and I don't expect the world to agree with me. You don't have to. We're all friends here.

I've always been divided on that kind of stuff because it is definitely stereotyping, and that by itself is not a good practice I think but it also doesn't strike me as an atrocity. After all, I hear that Mexicans love Speedy Gonzales and Native Americans love Chief Thunder (especially the 90's design). I guess it comes down to whether it's a stereotype to celebrate a culture or a sterotype to put one down. As for whether it's racist or not... Can't say. All I can say is that it doesn't offend me much. <br />Okay the Blue=Boy thing gets me a little. But not much. <br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">I feel like a well know Feminist blogger should do an episode about that. And don't correct me for clarity, mods, I write specifically obscurely...to not have my posts linked to by Google searches for a subject which I don't want to be attached to.</div><br /><br />It still makes me upset when people bring this up. I was involved in this movement at the very beginning back when it did what it said on the tin. That was the most exciting month of my life, feeling like I was doing something. Then people on my side started returning fire on shit-slingers and both sides lost any credibility as a whole. Another great thing derailed by petty insults. Then the freaking SVU episode came out and boy am I still sore. It pains me to no end that nothing good came of all that...

That limits my possible settings to things that include the facilities and traditions that go along with my swords and shields. I can either go with a generic fantasy setting or I can research around about other cultures I might can work it in to. I'm interested in using a unique setting, but I also want the world to be consistent, so I'm probably going to end up picking the path of least resistance here. That's enough justification in my eyes. <br /><br />Phew, these conversations are really hard to have. There are so many things that need to be said very carefully in a given political climate.

For Run 'n' Gun, which started this discussion, I don't feel that it fits. However, with my main game which I'm taking a break from to make Run 'n' Gun, the protagonist is female, and it also takes place in an world which is a macrocosm, encompassing European and Asian influenced elements. It's a total work of fiction and a smaller world than our Earth, so I chose to just pick the elements I thought would work well in a game.<br /><br />I feel like the concept is worth talking about to put into developers' minds that there are characters who can be portrayed who are not white male. However, I don't think anybody should be pressured to do so for a particular release if it's not what they are making. The last thing I think anybody wants to do is polarize the issue, and that's what often happens with debates on matters like these.
