While it is a known fact nowadays how some PAL conversions of NES games are just plain garbage like not optimizing game speed, pitch in music etc. I found something special.<br />I can't really compare this to the case of Shadow Warriors, where the DPCM samples are corrupted for whatever reason... (replacing the hardwired bank with NG's data solves the problem there) but it is a weird music bug that went unnoticed by developers.<br />It is an unknown SMHUP game called Over Horizon (only came out in Germany and Japan).<br />I was playing the game, and all of a sudden the channels went out of sync. Triangle drums got all weird, and noise was playing its own thing.<br /><br />I was like... OK, I probably used a bad dump.<br />Searched a few weeks for it, and every [E] version had this bug. Then I was like.... there is no way that they released the thing like this.<br /><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eKK5jYgJw3M" class="postlink">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eKK5jYgJw3M</a><br /><br />Turns out yeah... they released this like this.<br /><br />So all in all, without hesitation I can call this the worst PAL optimazed game (at least music wise).<br /><br />I attached .MP3 recordings from the ROMs. I used Stage 2's music, since it is quite good.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=6513">MrNorbert1994</a> — Mon Feb 19, 2018 9:20 am</p><hr />
