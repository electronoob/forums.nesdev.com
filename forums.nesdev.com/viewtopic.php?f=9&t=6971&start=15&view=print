You'd need a way to interface your storage device with a PC, upload the data to a hard drive or other storage card, then e-mail it. This means creating a USB link between your dongle and a PC, which may be as complex as using an SD card on the game cartridge. </div><br />Sometimes you want a no-copy flag so that someone doesn't clone your personal information. Games also want to deter item-cloning exploits that could wreck the in-game economy. Console-oriented memory cards support no-copy flags by allowing files to be moved from one memory card. SD cards ordinarily don't support this. That's why you can move Animal Crossing 1 (GameCube) files from one card to another but not Animal Crossing 3 (Wii) files. In theory, SD cards support a no-copy flag called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_Protection_for_Recordable_Media" class="postlink">CPRM</a>, but next to no reader devices support CPRM, and in any case, it's cost prohibitive for a hobbyist to license.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">It's a simple manner to back-up whatever you have on the card and it you lose it, or it is damaged, you can replace it.</div><br />How many caught Mew, how many Master Balls, and how many Rare Candies do you want the player to be able to restore from backup?<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">Additionally, SD cards are pretty tough. I've only had one die.</div><br />I've had a USB flash drive, an SD card, and two SD card readers die. The SD card was not of the "folding" type (which, as I understand it, is pretty much RS-MMC with another piece of plastic hanging off it).<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">Many systems today have only USB and micro-card ports, so serial is out, and if the USB controller doesn't recognize it and its data natively (using built-in or existing software drivers), then you'll need specialized software to view and extract it, which you'd have to make multi-platform (PC, Mac PPC/x86 dual-binary//Linux) in order to ensure market durability.</div>
<br />PowerPC may no longer be necessary. All Macs sold in the past four years are Intel. How long does Apple plan to support 10.5 (Leopard)? Free operating systems such as Linux will never support CPRM.

<br />
<br />
<br />And as to internet connectivity...I am not sure. If this project ever happens, I doubt people around the world will want to keep playing it and such, and if they they do, I am sure I could work something out with using CopyNES to edit game-save information. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" />
<br />
<br />
<br />And I've never done USB or do any electronics, my dad actually does, I just know how to desolder and solder stuff and make some dev carts. Thats as far as my knowledge goes so I am not sure about everything your saying. And USB from what I've heard is a nightmare, I have no experience, but I do sort of believe it. XD
<br />
<br />
<br />Well....don't know what to say now! So many different waays to do the same thing.....mmmm....
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />And you could always do a USB-&gt;dongle thing that has another PIC or something that gets the info off of the little serial eprom in it and send it out.  I don't know how, but it definently sounds plausible....
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />I wish I know more about Logic and electronics. T.T

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Ah, don't worry about the hardware-side of things too much.  Writing an interesting game is more of an achievement then building a simple memory storage interface.  You can put a read and a write routine in your game, and just by changing those 2 routines later (the hardware dudes will supply the code), it could read and write from any hardware.  For modest amount of testing of your save/load, you could just keep it in a .SAV file and hex edit the data in and out manually, as most of the needed testing will be for the PPU and game logic, I'm sure.
