A lot of wikis on Wikia appear to have a few steps between an ordinary registered user and what user:Ndwiki (root access) has:<br /><ol style="list-style-type: decimal"><li>autoconfirmed (add external links without CAPTCHA, edit semiprotected pages) </li><li>rollbacker (undo vandal edits without previewing, use various other tools provided by extensions) </li><li>sysop (edit protected pages, protect and unprotect pages, hide revisions, delete pages, block users), promote users to rollback </li><li>bureaucrat (promote users to sysop) </li></ol><p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=9">tepples</a> — Thu Jun 10, 2010 5:04 am</p><hr />

I thought I warned you guys about this back when the Wiki was being idealised?  "Told ya!"  :P  This is basically the only way the Whirlpool/Donut forum was able to deal with spammers as well -- their board was read-only for everyone, and only people with registered accounts could post.  (To get an account you had to Email the board maintainers, who would give you your own unique login/password)<br /><br />I have absolutely no objection to your proposal.  Thumbs up.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3">koitsu</a> — Thu Jun 10, 2010 2:25 am</p><hr />

Heh, I was just thinking of this very same thing. I've been posting a lot of test ROM links lately and am getting a little tired of the CAPTCHA as well. But I figured it's there in case my account gets compromised or something, though I guess that's a pretty remote possibility. One thing that's annoyed me is that the "This is a minor edit" checkbox reverts to its default value when the CAPTCHA comes up.<br /><br />I have no objection. As you say, this is a small group. Looking at the change log, it seems you admis spend significant time cleaning out spam that this would eliminate completely.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=17">blargg</a> — Wed Jun 09, 2010 11:22 pm</p><hr />

I'm getting a little bit fed up with the re-captcha plug-in since it only make our life miserable while the human spammers can still post their link...<br /><br />For now, the usefulness of this thing is 0% since it didn't block anything. So instead of making everyone suffer, I'm thinking about adding a new security level: creating a trusted group.<br /><br />What this mean is anybody can create an account but as long as you are in the normal user group: you cannot do anything.  Basically I want to add an approval system.  We don't approve the user right away and once we know who it is, we add the user in the trusted group.<br /><br />Names that sound fishy will never be approved unless that person comes on nesdev to explain his/her case.<br /><br />Our community is so small that I see no problem with it.  Anybody have any objection? I know Tepples will have some but I just want to shutdown the door to spammers, that's it. I don't mind to do the extra management since the number of users added to the wiki is low so it's quite a simple task to do.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3559">Banshaku</a> — Wed Jun 09, 2010 10:54 pm</p><hr />
