Because I have never experimented with FDS, I lack the confidence of first-hand experience.

tepples, why would you say "as I understand it" when you know for sure that's the case? Is it to avoid being arrogant? If you don't sound confident about the things you know people may lose the opportunity to learn something because you hesitated to state it as a fact.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=95">tokumaru</a> — Mon Mar 28, 2011 5:35 pm</p><hr />

How is it a different programming language? As I understand it, FDS games are still written in 6502 asm, and the custom IC in the FDS RAM cart is just a garden variety Famicom mapper: address decoder, IRQ, audio, and disk I/O.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=9">tepples</a> — Mon Mar 28, 2011 8:54 am</p><hr />

We were working with some stuff for a project this weekend. We (my friend) has made a test-cart with sockets (MMC3, TS-ROM) <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://bootgod.dyndns.org:7777/profile.php?id=2435">http://bootgod.dyndns.org:7777/profile.php?id=2435</a><!-- m --><br /><br />We made some test eproms using 27C010 eproms, and they worked fine in the test cart. Then we tried using 27C020 eproms (doubling up the data in a hexeditor so the filesize was doubled aswell...). No succes. The stuff we tried burning to the eproms didn't work. Strange, I guess it should work, or?<br /><br />According to the Repropak manual, <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.retrousb.com/product_info.php?cPath=24&amp;products_id=42">http://www.retrousb.com/product_info.ph ... ucts_id=42</a><!-- m --> - <br />You can use both 27c010 and 27c020 eproms for that board. <br /><br />Anyway I would like to make a MMC3 testcart for myself aswell. Could someone help me find pinout and instructions how to solder it? I tried finding it but without succes... <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" alt=":(" title="Sad" /><br /><br />Another question I have is: I want to make a D-pad Hero II repro. I need a TS-ROM donor cart for that aswell, or?<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3408">Kreese</a> — Wed Mar 23, 2011 9:40 am</p><hr />
