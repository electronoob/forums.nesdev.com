		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Congratulations on releasing the game.<br /><br />This week I was able to play through The Legends of Owlia and the overall structure of the game actually felt a bit like Nomolos but with a top-down perspective instead of a side scrolling platformer. I hardly paid attention to the existence of money as I pretty much killed everything in sight to make sure I didn't miss a chest with a key. The one puzzle that took the longest for me to do was the snowball puzzle, and that was because I stubbornly didn't follow the advice of the guy in that area. For the last two dungeons, I kind of failed to find the puzzle clues, so I ended up brute forcing all the puzzles in those places. I found the hints for the last dungeon after second glance through all the areas.<br /><br />I know reporting bugs are a bit late for a game in production like this, but while playing the game I did find what I think are 2 bugs. If you try to use your bomb while 2 bombs are on screen, your inventory still depletes despite no bomb being thrown (likewise with lanterns). In the switch room of Mermon's fortress, if you kill both enemies before pressing switches, the bottom right switch stops functioning. After that I reverse-engineered the password coding, and actually found a crashing bug with certain passwords that have invalid amounts of GP.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Replaying this, and I have to say the thing that stuck with me the most is the music. Especially the forest and tundra themes are my favorite tunes in the game. The small things in this game that are counter-intuitive really drive me insane, but if someone told me this was released when the NES was alive I'd believe them. It more than gets by on its merits, and it really is a joy to play.<br /><br />I'm also a big fan of the puzzles. The very first puzzle with the anglerfish stands out to me as being really unique and fun.
