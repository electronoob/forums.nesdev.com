		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />The resistor is supposed to be in the cartridge, all the expansion port needs to do is add 2 wires to redirect the audio i/o.  I will put sound i/o on my next cart design (but there will continue to be support for expansion sound on a toploader, or any completely un-modded NES), and as a musician I don't really trust a random resistor someone else picked out, because it could too easily end up sounding "wrong" (and with no frame of reference, who would even know it?).  With Famicom, the mixing is done on cartridge as well.
<br />
<br />I'm still kind of torn on whether to design an under-NES board into my setup, the main problem is the features may suffer from the more limited I/O.  There are 10 general-purpose pins, down to 8 once you use audio.  I guess I could put a CPLD on there and multiplex those lines somehow.  Maybe it wouldn't be too hard to let it run in a 'compatibility' mode where the cartridge wouldn't need any extra chips to use it (bankswitching "for free"?).  I'm not sure yet.
<br />
<br />It also seems like a design challenge to make a larger-sized expansion connector board, I guess some stand-offs with rubber feet or screwed to a bigger plate.  It needs to support the weight of the NES, being slid around on, and at the same time not put any stress on the solder joints.  A proper plastic base for the NES is pretty much out of the question for me to afford. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_neutral.gif" alt=":|" title="Neutral" />

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I would be interested in such add-ons.
<br />but what can this port do?
<br />I am uneducated in the abilities of the expansion port of the nes.
<br />
<br />But here are some ideas that most likely require expert engineering.
<br />I'm sure these ideas if possible would be quite expensive to implement
<br />
<br />I would of course support the either simple FDS sound expansion port add-on simply to keep my nes as unmodified as possible  even though I'm quite capable of soldering.  I would buy one even though its rather simple of just 2 connectors and a resistor
<br />
<br />But I'd like to see something much more interesting
<br />I'm curious of the possibility of an external sound mixer
<br />You know it   Stereo
<br />think an add-on expansion port on the bottom of the system could be created to support 2 RCA jacks and the components required to output this? If it's possible I wouldn't stop there.  Add a small variable resistor (?) to modify the stereo output mixing level   turn it all the way down the 2 sides are isolated as you turn it up mix the channels together
<br />
<br />I'm sure you should have seen the original mod.  
<br />I want to see the same concept that plugs into the bottom.
<br />If this cannot be done with the expansion port alone and  some soldering was required id still buy it for the fact I wouldn't need to drill my nes case 
<br />
<br />This might go into the realm of impossible but here it goes
<br />Time to dream big!
<br />
<br />an expansion port add-on that would attach a copynes or some debugging utility ,   or something that could write and or dump save files
<br />Considering that your post only mentioned producing something simple perhaps if an effort was made in collaboration with someone with these engineering skills this idea and others might not be far off   
<br />
<br />either with soldering or without soldering i would like to see a copynes type item that sat outside the box  
<br />
<br />allot of people said the expansion port had allot of the capabilities of a normal cart  if this is true then it opens the possibility of a alternate powerpak or perhaps something that could enhance its abilities to help support more mappers. I would like to see the nes accept a CF card without the need of a cart in the machine running.  
<br />
<br />Let's go for some other ideas too
<br />Like I keep saying I'm sure these are impossible but I'm trying to light a kindle of a flame.  I'm not an expert so please don't assume that I am
<br />I want people to think bigger!
<br />
<br />Save states     (SD CARDS <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /> )
<br />Screenshots  
<br />Record game play  record the memory state    
<br />OR 
<br />Game replay   IE playback of recorded in the form of a FCE movie playback (which I believe is not an actual movie per say but a recorded memory state being played) and then played back by injecting that recorded ram state into the memory which would begin playback the game play
<br />I'm sure that would require a separate processor to do this kind of a memory dump and injection real-time
<br />Well I'm sure half the forum is laughing at my obscene ideas 
<br />If anything please consider real FDS support and mixable stereo sound
<br />everything else i said can be done with a poor mans emulator

All it can do is have extra sound in, and like you said, it could take AV out too. It can have adressed registers via $4016 and $4017, and that's it. The only way it could do expansion sound without anything special on the cartridge is if you'd have new sound channel(s) which is (are) entierely adressed via low bits of $4016 and $4017, which sounds restricted to me. If such a device were created, games could have expansion sounds using normal mappers, which would be cool.
<br />
<br />Another thing I think would be great would be to have some kind of EEPROM wired to $4016 and $4017 so games could do secured saves, and all that using normal mappers.
<br />
<br />Anything else would require a special cartridge anyways, so you'd as well end up doing everything in the cartridge, unless you run out of space.

<br />
<br />Bregalad is right that you would need a special cartridge to take advantage of a lot of things it could do.  That's no big deal I think, but what is kind-of a bigger deal is that by doing so you will be forsaking all compatibilty with the NES2 (toploader), as well as Famicoms and Famiclones.  Which is a lot to lose..

<br />
<br />I suppose that's the case, but AFAIK all the Famiclones that have problems are a lot more recent than the MMC5.  The Tristar/Super-8 is known for being pretty good, as well as the pre-NOAC (discrete chip) clones that I'm aware of.  I haven't personally tried MMC5 carts on them, but I would be surprised if they didn't work on the more accurate (directly copied?) clones.

<br />
<br />
<br />So the one I made allows you to use the FDS adapter in a front loader.
<br />I also added an audio out cable to the adapter that connects with a Y-adapter to the output of the NES so you can get the Famicom cart sound output without any modifications to your NES.

<br />
<br />Update: I had a spinal injury that put me out of action for a while. The first batch came in with a bit of a problem, as they were too snug (the central gutter is too tight) and I am having another set made with correct measurements. The pins and all other measurements were perfect, so this is only a temporary delay. 
<br />
<br />I should have the next batch in 1-2 weeks and thereupon; I will be able to offer them presently. 
<br />
<br />If anybody has product designs in mind that can utilize the port, please contact me. I have an idea of my own for a co-processor design that will utilize both the port and the cartridge bay for a very special purpose, but I need some talented help to materialize it. If you are good at VERILOG, please contact me ASAP.
<br />
<br /><strong>EDIT: I</strong> also need to decide how many to produce in the <em>first production run</em>, so if you are interested in ordering the connectors or wish to have me produce a PCB with the connector as part of it, please let me know and <span style="text-decoration: underline">tell me how many pieces you will want. </span>
<br />
<br />The larger the run, the less each connector will cost, so if there is a greater demand, there will be a correlative discount in the component cost!
