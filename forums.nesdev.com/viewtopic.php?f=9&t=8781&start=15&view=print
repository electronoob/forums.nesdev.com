<br />
<br />I've got some curiosity questions more to do with some of the technical details.  For one I'm curious as to the interfacing done by the FPGA seems like 140 some I/O should be more than enough but you commented on I/O at a premium suggesting you're using most of them.  I suppose once the technical details come out that would allow one to make their own mapper most of my queries will be answered...
<br />
<br />Also how are you level shifting?  The FPGA isn't 5V tolerant but it looks like you just have some resistors between the cart edge and FPGA pins?  Am I missing something or does the dendy not operate at 5V?  Just curious what your trick was here.
<br />
<br />So is there not separate WRAM?  I guess with the large amount of PRG RAM you can use the mapper to place the WRAM as a page or two of the same PRG RAM where the ROM image would exist?
<br />
<br />Any plans or goals on a release date?  If it's well documented I'd be interested in playing around with one.

<br />If your mappers are faithful to the originals I'm sure this will happen naturally. I just ask of you to not use "hacks" just to get games working, because that reduces the reliability of the cart as a development tool.

<br />Most of us already own PowerPaks, and it's great to play games and all, but it's kinda lacking as a development unit. Your cart has the potential to be a great development tool, so please keep that in mind.

<br />
<br />Maybe it's just me, but I don't follow how a mere current limiting resistor saves the FPGA inputs from damage/accelerated wear.  So if I'm not mistaken these are the DC limits of your device: <a href="http://www.altera.com/literature/hb/cyc2/cyc2_cii51005.pdf" class="postlink">http://www.altera.com/literature/hb/cyc2/cyc2_cii51005.pdf</a>
<br />According to that  the absolute maximum input voltage is 4.0v @ 100% duty cycle and 4.2v at 50% duty cycle.  Even with the current limiting resistors you've still got 5.0v present at the pins with the assumption that the input impedance of the pins is relatively high.  Have you probed the pins to see what you actually have?  The data sheet's warning would leave me a little concerned that this method of level shifting would limit life of the device:
<br />
<br />"Conditions beyond those listed in this table cause permanent damage to a device. These are stress ratings only.
<br />Functional operation at these levels or any other conditions beyond those specified in this chapter is not implied.
<br />Additionally, device operation at the absolute maximum ratings for extended periods of time may have adverse
<br />effect on the device reliability."
<br />
<br />Is there something out there that shows how level shifting in this manner affects lifetime of the device?  I'm not doubting that it doesn't work as is, but If you have more than 4.0V present on the pins I would expect that it won't survive over time...
<br />
<br />I don't mean to be a naysayer, but it sounds like there is still time to toss in some level shifters if you decided to.

<br />I understand your concern. Many of you use <a href="http://krikzz.com/mega-ed.html" class="postlink">Krikzz</a> products and has no negative feedback. I mean non exUSSR users. I think that was enough time to testing in real conditions.

<br />A lot of niche forums appear to prefer e-mail accounts from domains owned by wired ISPs over free webmail provider domains because it's easier for a spammer to get away with using a disposable webmail account over one at an ISP domain that someone is presumably paying for.
<br />
<br />Workaround: Register your own domain and put Google Apps on it.

<br />Since all slot pins are goes thru FPGA, you can bankswitch every single byte of SRAM. But it will be expencive for FPGA. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" />
