In the other topic, I posted without realizing this topic existed. I wrote:<br /><br />------<br />Even if you go back to an area and the enemies are alive, it's better than an enemy infinitely respawning and walking on screen. That sort of glitch is avoidable. I say enemies can spawn as soon as they come half a screen beyond the edge of the screen. Then they should remain "inactive" until they are at the edge of the screen. That way, the player will have to walk almost 128 pixels in that direction in order for it to start doing anything, so that by the time you kill it, you are probably past the point at which it would respawn. Though that's just a quick improvement (not a fix).<br /><br />I will probably take the time to make sure this problem does not occur in my game. All it takes is one bit for each object. Though this could take up a lot of RAM if you have a ton of objects.<br /><br />-----<br /><br />And I am probably going to have a limit like tokumaru of 256 objects per level, which is more acceptable for me as I have 20ish screen-long levels that are 1 screen tall. But that will make up for my graphical limitations.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=138">Celius</a> — Fri May 22, 2009 12:46 pm</p><hr />

Should special objects need more than a bit (which is the case with formations), there are 128 bytes of RAM available to them, and the "parameter byte" in their definitions (my object definitions have 4 elements: X coord, Y coord, type and parameter, which is used differently for each type) is a pointer to which part of this memory it uses (they can use as many bytes as they want, as long as it all fits in). It's the best I could do without extra RAM.<br /><br />The ideal thing would probably be keeping the object definitions themselves in RAM, so that you could modify whatever you wanted about the objects, even their positions (although this might require some sorting if the object-loading code expects a sorted list). This is only possible with extra RAM though, as object definitions can take up a lot of space.<br /><br />I don't know if 256 objects is a good limit for levels as big as I want, I hope it'll be enough. This limitation is not RAM-related, as it would be easy to get, say, 32 more bytes for object bits, it's more related to ROM (I don't have much for definitions) and the code that loads objects (which is easier to code and runs faster if objects can be indexed by a single byte). Although now that I think of it, it should be easy to trigger an event in the middle of the level to switch to another table of object definitions, if I really needed more than 256.<br /><br />BTW, why split from my post? You and Celius mentioned respawning before I did. Not that I'm complaining, I'm just curious.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=95">tokumaru</a> — Fri May 22, 2009 10:32 am</p><hr />

I think it really depends on the type of game and design decision. For example, Ninja gaiden 1 and 2 have this "issue" but not #3.  #3 doesn't have any extra ram.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3559">Banshaku</a> — Fri May 22, 2009 8:09 am</p><hr />
