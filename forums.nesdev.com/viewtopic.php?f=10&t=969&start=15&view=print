<br />I'd make the call to wait_vblank the first thing in this routine. Not that it REALLY matters in this case, 'cause you had the PPU off for a really short time (you wrote only 2 tiles), so the VBlank probably hasn't ended by now. But if you wrote more stuff, like a whole screen, we would be in the middle of rendering by now, and if you turned the screen on you'd actually see only part of it on the screen and it'd be probably pretty messed up.
<br />
<br />It would be messed up for the rest of the frame, when you'd then write 0's to $2005. Well, just kick the VBlank waiting up and the rest is fine in this order.
<br />
<br />One small note: there is no need to load A with #$0 twice, just load it once and write twice in a row. Not that there is an error here or anything, only loading once is faster. =)
<br />
<br />I think that's it. I see no reason for it not to work. What do you see when you run this? Still the same 1 tile repeated all over?
<br />
<br />You know what just crossed my mind? Some emulators cut the first and the last rows of the screen, wich means you'll not be able to see the stuff you wrote... try writing to the second or third row, preferably more to the middle... Try writing your tiles to address $2070 for example, instead of $2000.

<br />I've moved everything like you suggested.  The LDX was from a previous
<br />attempt and I forgot to remove it.  Thanks for pointing that out.
<br />
<br />After adding another wait_vblank and moving the tiles to $2070 (because
<br />you were right ... the tiles @ $2000 were being cut off) I no longer have
<br />a whole screen of tile 1 but the tiles I asked for (and blanking tile 00 and FF
<br />thanks to Quietust)!
<br />
<br />Thanks everyone for the better understanding of backgrounds ... now Im
<br />on to scrolling.....

<br />Yeah, this is probably a good idea. I just don't do that because I never assume any values. I only read stuff from places I've already written to, but not necessarily in huge "memory clearing" blocks. If you want to be safe, just clear the whole thing as tepples said.

<br />
<br />Ok then I shall do that from now on.  I just have one more question and
<br />I should be well on my way.  My beginning post I asked about adding 
<br />a second chr file (one for backgrounds and one for sprites) and Bregalad
<br />was kind enough to answer.  I've done the following:
<br />
<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">... other code removed to save space ..<br />palette:<br />&nbsp;lda #$3F<br />&nbsp;sta $2006&nbsp; &nbsp;; SPRITE Palette<br />&nbsp;lda #$10<br />&nbsp;sta $2006<br /><br />&nbsp;lda #$0d<br />&nbsp;sta $2007<br />&nbsp;lda #$08<br />&nbsp;sta $2007<br />&nbsp;lda #$28<br />&nbsp;sta $2007<br />&nbsp;lda #$19<br />&nbsp;sta $2007<br /><br />&nbsp;lda #$3F<br />&nbsp;sta $2006&nbsp; &nbsp;; BACKGROUND Palette<br />&nbsp;lda #$00<br />&nbsp;sta $2006<br /><br />&nbsp;lda #$0d<br />&nbsp;sta $2007<br />&nbsp;lda #$08<br />&nbsp;sta $2007<br />&nbsp;lda #$28<br />&nbsp;sta $2007<br />&nbsp;lda #$19<br />&nbsp;sta $2007<br />&nbsp;rts<br /><br />... other code removed ...<br /><br /><br />ppuinit:<br />&nbsp;lda #%10010000 ; &lt;-- 2000.4 to add bg @ $1000<br />&nbsp;sta $2000&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />&nbsp;lda #%00011000 ; &lt;-- both sprite and bg bit on<br />&nbsp;sta $2001&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />&nbsp;lda #$0<br />&nbsp;sta $2005<br />&nbsp;sta $2005<br />&nbsp;rts<br /><br />....other code removed ...<br /><br />&nbsp;.bank 1<br />&nbsp;.org $fffa<br />&nbsp;.dw nmi,main,int<br />&nbsp;.bank 2<br />&nbsp;.org 0<br />&nbsp;.incbin &quot;spr.chr&quot;<br />&nbsp;.incbin &quot;bk.chr&quot;&nbsp; ; &lt;--- added the background chr<br /></div>
<br />
<br />All I can see is my sprite and not the background.  Is there something
<br />else I left out?  It seems as though my second incbin (bk.chr) isn't going
<br />to $1000 pattern table.  I'll continue searching .. just thought someone
<br />might have seen this right off.  Keep in mind I am <strong>still</strong> using 
<br />nesasm.
<br />
<br />Thanks

<br />
<br />Actually, the proper way is to write $2000 once and $2005 twice - a double write to $2006 isn't very useful for setting the viewport at a specific location, since you're stuck (mostly) on tile boundaries and you have to do extra math to figure out the proper address to use.

The code you posted seems fine, I don't think it has anything to do with the code, wich means no NES/6502 documents are going to help you. This seems like a assembler issue to. I never used NESASM, so I can't help you.
<br />
<br />Are your CHR banks 4k in size each? What exactly is the problem you're having?

<br />
<br />um... yeah ... I'm about to go home and check my chr size.  If they're bigger than 4k each
<br />is that my issue?  My problem exactly is that I can get sprites and background to show
<br />at the same time.  I can have either backgrounds showing at one time or the sprites.  I've
<br />set the appropriate values for $2000.3(0) and 2000.4 (1) and 2001.3/4  to 1.  With these
<br />values and 
<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent"><br /><br />&nbsp;.bank 1<br />&nbsp;.org $fffa<br />&nbsp;.dw nmi,main,int<br />&nbsp;.bank 2<br />&nbsp;.org 0<br />&nbsp;.incbin &quot;spr.chr&quot;<br />&nbsp;.incbin &quot;bk.chr&quot; <br /><br /></div>
<br />
<br />set I only see the sprites.  Not the background.  So at this point I'm assuming that you're 
<br />hinting that if the size isn't 4k a piece then that is my issue?  Thanks.
<br />
<br />
<br />EDIT:  I did use yy-chr to create my chr files ... if that helps on the size question

However, the worst thing that should be happening (in case you can't load the second CHR file) is that both of them (sprites and BG) were using the same pattern table (the same 256 tiles), and not one of them disappearing completly, wich is really strange.<br /><br />Maybe the second CHR isn't beeing added correctly but the PPU tries to use it anyway, in wich case you'll only get blank stuff (in an emulator, anyway), but you have to ask the NESASM'ers around.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">lynxsolaris wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">Write when? at the end of NMI?</div>
<br />
<br />Whenever a frame is to be rendered, you do this before the frame starts. So, usually in the NMI, yes. The thing is that, for learning purposes and small stuff, people usually set up everything on start up and jump into an infinite loop, with NMI's disabled.
<br />
<br />But in a real case scenario, you'd want to leave NMI's on, and set up the nametable to show ($2000) and the scroll values ($2005) at the end of it. You can rely on these writes to have your screen stable. $2006 can be used to scroll the screen, yes, but is only necessary when changing the scroll values in the middle of the screen for split-screen effects, and you shouldn't worry about it yet.

<br />
<br />I did what you guys said and that seemed to produce a better response.
<br />I can see my sprite in front of a background ... however, its not the correct
<br />background.  It's reading my spr.chr (sprite) for the background.  So
<br />tiles 1 and 2 of the spr.chr are displayed ( not tiles 1 and 2 of bk.chr which
<br />should be displayed).  I downloaded nintendulator and when I select the
<br />disassembly the pattern tables window only shows the contents of my 
<br />spr.chr and displays nothing from bk.chr.  Does this sound like a compiler
<br />issuse ( because I'm using nesasm) or just me probably doing something
<br />dumb.  Can post complete code if needed.  Thanks for sticking in there with
<br />me.  I bet I never forget how to do backgrounds after this ......

<br />Maybe you're doing something dumb that results in a compiler(assembler) issue! Just kidding... =)
<br />
<br />Now seriously, maybe you just did not get the correct way of including CHR files in NASASM. I do it the old fashioned way: use the command prompt to join my files, using a command similar to "copy /b header + code + bg + sprites rom.nes".
<br />
<br />If you can successifully add one CHR file, maybe you should join both and include it instead. Just do the copy thing in the command prompt: "copy /b spr.chr + bg.chr all.chr" and include all.chr instead. Maybe it will work then.

I do it the old fashioned way: use the command prompt to join my files, using a command similar to "copy /b header + code + bg + sprites rom.nes".<br /><br />If you can successifully add one CHR file, maybe you should join both and include it instead. Just do the copy thing in the command prompt: "copy /b spr.chr + bg.chr all.chr" and include all.chr instead. Maybe it will work then.</div>
<br />
<br />I will try what you suggested.  Just wondering .. what compiler do you 
<br />use?
