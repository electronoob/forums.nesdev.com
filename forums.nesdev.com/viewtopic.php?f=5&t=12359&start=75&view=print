I never felt the need to change any font settings, and they all look perfectly fine and readable to me.</div><br />Same here. The font is perfectly legible in W7. But I think koitsu needed any excuse to call W7 shit so he could return to XP and took this one. He could also complain about the lack 8.3 names in all caps limitation for files or stuff like that.^<br /><br />It is true that I have some nostalgia for W95 and 98, but definitely not for XP ironically as it was never my main operating system and I never liked it (I switched directly from 2000 to seven).<br /><br />Also this is a completely different topic, but I agree that the turns &quot;technology&quot; has taken lately are not very glorious. However, koitsu never points to anything concrete (except fonts, which is for me not a &quot;problem&quot; at all) so it's hard to get a hold a what exactly is so wrong. If you cannot word/point out a problem, you certainly cannot either solve it or find your way arround it. Quitting &quot;technology&quot; as a whole seems a bit over-ambitious, but if you'd need to do that it seems becoming a farmer or another job in the 1st sectory would be the best answer. But we should not forget that those jobs are really <em>hard </em>physically, much more so than working with &quot;technology&quot; or any other modern job.<br /><br />In my opinion if I were out to point what exactly is wrong with technology today (although some of them are more nostalgia than actually wrong thigns), I'd say the following :<br /><br /><ul><li>Smartphones : I just don't like them. They are around only since 7 years, and have been really democratized extremely quickly. The main reason I don't like them is that people buy a new one every year no matter if their old one still works because they're just attracted by ads and *have* to get the last one.<br /></li><li>Everything is made in China, and is extremely low quality. Everything is made to be put to trash as soon as possible in order to buy a new one as soon as possible and continue the exponential PIB growth of companies that capitalism requires to work (ironically, based on a communist country). The problem is that not only this ruins the environment, but also once the real growth has reached a limit they resort to artificial tricks to fake a growth or they're dead.<br /></li><li>The rise of &quot;connected&quot; stuff : Personally I prefer keeping as much things offline as possible in order to reduce risks of both piracy and privacy problems. I think it is sometime a good idea not to add network capability to devices, but...<br /></li><li>The &quot;everything should be updated regularly&quot; fad. Back in the 90s programs could not get updates regularly as you just had the version that came with your CD, and this was perfectly great. Developers had to make sure there was as few bugs as possible, because they couldn't &quot;just get an upgrade&quot; later. And as a user you could just work around bugs when you found them. However, I must also say update regularly has many advantages both as developer and user : As a developer you can immediately fix your mistakes and blame the user if they don't update, and as a user you get hope for new features or bugfixes constantly.<br /></li><li>The fact it's harder to get pirated programs. Back in the 90s there were those CDs with hundreds of them that circulated around everywhere. Now this is compensated by the fact we can get GNU programs for free easily so it's not that bad.<br /></li><li>The fact apple is now considered &quot;cool&quot;, when it was considered bullshit before 2007. I don't know why but now I feel less bad about old macs, because while I didn't like them back then, they were definitely better than modern macs (i.e. at least they were <em>actually </em>different from PCs and weren't all about the look of the case...)<br /></li><li>Not really related to technology, but sort-of : The fact there is more and more &quot;managers&quot; and &quot;process engineers&quot; and bullshit like that instead of real jobs like electrical engineer, etc...<br /></li><li>Knowing a programming language no longer impress anybody, while in the 90s you were considered a very smart and knowledgeable person just for that (especially as a kid).</li></ul><br />Is that what you mean koitsu, or are you talking about somehting completely different ? I have no way to know, since you constantly rant about everything being wrong without talking about anything specifically (other than fonts) which is extremely non-constructive.<br /><br />Also ironically the fact that Windows as a whole is much less mainstream than before is one of the biggest change of the past 10 years, but Koitsu is contributing to it...

But you may also, know a different programming language than someone else, and/or you may prefer different ones. Also there are a lot of programming languages, including general-purpose, graphical, domain-specific, esoteric, etc. I wouldn't expect that most people even who know a few programming languages would possibly know all of them (even I don't know about <em>all</em> programming languages, although I know more than some people).<br /><br />Nevertheless there is a lot more to be considered than just what you wrote! These aren't the only problems, please!

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I liked unantialiased fonts until I got used to antialiased fonts. The other thing was that I was still using a CRT monitor, so cleartype did nothing for me. I stuck with plain grayscale AA until I finally moved to an LCD screen where, at native resolution, I could finally take advantage of cleartype. Ever since then, I've just gotten used to it to the point where plain non-AA'd pixel fonts are hard on my eyes (It's too sharp and skinny, there's too much contrast, and my eyes focus on it too hard; it was fine in the 800x600 days, but not anymore). That's why I'm bewildered that so many of you prefer to have unantialiased fonts. CT exists because it improves readability beyond what plain pixel fonts can do, it's not just some pointless bell and whistle. You all sound like the only reason you hate it is because it's different, not unlike those who'd complain about the rise of mouse-driven GUIs instead of keyboard-only interfaces.<br /><br />TL;DR: I don't know why you guys hate cleartype so much, and I think you're just screwing yourselves over by being so stubborn about it.<br /><br />Fundamental changes to workflow, I can understand, but the visual representation of text on a screen, I cannot. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" /><br /><br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">Bregalad wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">Quitting &quot;technology&quot; as a whole seems a bit over-ambitious</div><br />I think it takes a certain predisposition to cause the events of Koitsu's stories; either that or a really horrible robot takeover or some other reason to have PTSD from tech.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">Smartphones : I just don't like them.

Well, FOSS software tends to blow chunks compared to the stuff you buy, so I see where you're coming from, but that's a problem with the nature of something being open source; if anyone can stick their fingers in it, then you can expect both great and crappy designers to do so, leading to a mishmash of conflicting ideas and very little coherence. With that said, I like the idea of open source software, and I think it can be done correctly, and there are certainly situations where GPLs and copylefts are a great benefit (such as emulators and anything research-based), but my oh my is it a huge mess right now.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">The fact apple is now considered &quot;cool&quot;, when it was considered bullshit before 2007.

It was less about the user and more about the look. Early GUI-driven Apple products were focused on being straightforward to use, recalling that this was during a time when you needed to keep a huge manual ready if you wanted to do anything with your commandline terminal. Somewhere along the line, they got really arrogant, and their fanbase reflects that. Apple really cannot do any bad these days, everyone will eat their products up regardless.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">Not really related to technology, but sort-of : The fact there is more and more &quot;managers&quot; and &quot;process engineers&quot; and bullshit like that instead of real jobs like electrical engineer, etc...</div><br />I dunno anything about this. If anything, I'd be more annoyed that the higherups in any company are usually disconnected from their actual workers, implementing ideas that sound good on paper and sound good within the manager circle, but any workers could point out the flaws and make improvements if they'd just get their input. I deal with this in my non-tech job, I can only imagine how much worse it is in an actual tech job.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">Knowing a programming language no longer impress anybody, while in the 90s you were considered a very smart and knowledgeable person just for that (especially as a kid).</div><br />Ugh. I've known too many people who are overly-proud of the languages that they know. You know, the ones that scoff at anyone who says they use a C-like language, or anyone who doesn't use the C-extension they use. Especially programmers who are impatient about explaining things or are too arrogant about their methodology (just flip through stack exchange, you'll see what I mean). Really, if a language or a coding style works for you, then use it; nobody needs a bunch of terminal monkeys having a religious war about which whitespace style is superior, or why one language is so much better than this other language.

It just was different when most computers just had a floppy and CD drive instead of an internet connexion as a way to get and install programs. Back then network connexion was a gimmick that you didn't need. Nowadays a computer without it would be completely unusable, on the other side disk drives are almost a gimmick that you don't need any longer (even a CD/DVD drive).<br /><br />Perhaps the situation today is better for this regard, but still I feel nostalgia for the &quot;old&quot; way when programs were installed once from a CD and never upgraded.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">Nevertheless there is a lot more to be considered than just what you wrote!

Before the web was a lot of small websites, now it's half-a-dozen huge websites, and there is no way around that.

Personally I now just buy what I need and nothing else, so I'd rather pay more to get something more valuable/that last longer, but the option is not even there, because people just want to buy lots of cheap stuff and trash it 6 months later, so that is basically what all the shops propose.

The other thing was that I was still using a CRT monitor, so cleartype did nothing for me. I stuck with plain grayscale AA until I finally moved to an LCD screen where, at native resolution, I could finally take advantage of cleartype. Ever since then, I've just gotten used to it to the point where plain non-AA'd pixel fonts are hard on my eyes (It's too sharp and skinny, there's too much contrast, and my eyes focus on it too hard; it was fine in the 800x600 days, but not anymore). That's why I'm bewildered that so many of you prefer to have unantialiased fonts. CT exists because it improves readability beyond what plain pixel fonts can do, it's not just some pointless bell and whistle. You all sound like the only reason you hate it is because it's different, not unlike those who'd complain about the rise of mouse-driven GUIs instead of keyboard-only interfaces.<br /><br />TL;DR: I don't know why you guys hate cleartype so much, and I think you're just screwing yourselves over by being so stubborn about it.</div><br /><br />&quot;I changed my mind about this one thing, therefore everybody should.&quot;<br /><br />You yourself realize that you used to have a different opinion. This is not an objective matter. This is a preference. When your ability to configure a program to your preference is becomes restricted in an &quot;upgrade&quot;, it does not feel like an upgrade at all, in that respect. Not everyone's eyes and brains operate in quite the same manner, the way text is rendered feels different to different people. Just because you got used to something in particular doesn't mean everyone can have the same experience.<br /><br />Personally, I am strongly opposed to sub-pixel rendering. I can clearly see the red and blue fringes, and I find it disturbing. We have created aliasing in the colour domain to reduce aliasing in the shape domain? I don't like this tradeoff. It's also completely busted if you want to rotate one monitor. Greyscale anti-aliasing is better to me, in that respect, at least. My preference, though, is for flat lines, clear pixels. The fuzziness suggests a lack of focus to my brain, and I don't like it. This has nothing to do with &quot;getting used to it&quot;. My phone has no option to disable AA and I use it plenty. Using something more doesn't mean I like it better. Why would it?<br /><br />There are many situations where I would use greyscale anti-aliasing by choice, such as rendering a video which could display at multiple sizes, or for aesthetic purposes when creating a logo, etc. When I'm looking to read text on a webpage, though, I am concerned about comfort of reading, not about aesthetic appearance. I want to understand the text faster and more comfortably. What reads quickly and comfortably <strong><em>IS NOT UNIVERSAL</em></strong>. Options are important here!!!

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />For those who think I'm just bitching about Windows 7 to bitch about it without &quot;any concrete details/evidence/whatever&quot; -- see the screenshots posted earlier (combined with other people disliking the same thing, and one guy getting bit by that ridiculous bug in the recent Windows KB), and see <a href="http://wiki.nesdev.com/w/index.php/User:Koitsu#Why_I_still_run_Windows_XP_in_2014" class="postlink">my wiki page</a> that I've been trying to put together for several years (hardly finished).  The number of issues I have with 7 are many, and it would probably take me months of actual man-hours to put together a full list of EVERYTHING that is a step backward.  Furthermore, I've realised it's not even really worth listing it all off -- Microsoft will never come out with SP2 for 7, so there's zero chance of any of this shit getting fixed.  (This is a problem with our current technological model in general these days -- release something, then never actually maintain it, instead all time being spent on some new thing, rinse lather repeat.  I see this constantly at my day job and subsequently our partners and their development models too.  It's disheartening)<br /><br />I was telling someone last night the following (a gal who also dislikes 7 and hates 8 even more, and overall prefers XP): every Windows release since XP has gotten better in regards to kernel/device driver support/underlying infrastructure framework, for the most part (Vista has some exceptions).  But that only makes up maybe 20% of what a GUI-based OS provides -- the remaining 80% is what most end-users have to deal with/interact with, and it's the stuff that ultimately matters (and if you think I'm shitting you, then go explain the MSFT stock drop I mentioned earlier in the thread, re: Windows 10).  So you now have releases of products that are 1/5th better than their predecessor, but maybe 3/5ths or 4/5ths worse than their predecessor.  Why would someone accept that imbalance?  To me, it's literally saying this: &quot;yeah, I'm totally cool with 60-80% of something new sucking ass, because hey the 20% is still better&quot; -- it's a mentality that doesn't make any sense to me.  The positives should outweigh the negatives.<br /><br />Actually, fuck it -- don't bother reading it.  You've made up your mind/have your own opinion, just as I have mine, and they're both based on our separate experiences -- which means we're probably never going to find any common ground on this subject.  There's no way to satiate someone who can't put themselves in another's shoes.  rainwarrior summed it up.<br /><br />And no, my general opinion of CT is this: it <strong>does not</strong> look better to me, on almost any LCD I've used in the past 10 years (most of which have been either 1920x1200 @ 24&quot; displays, or sometimes 1366x768 @ 15&quot;).  What rainwarrior describes (coloured fringes around the outlines of the glyphs) looks awful to me, just as they do him.  The only exception I've encountered was when using a different OS (OS X) on different hardware (Macbook with a Retina display) -- they don't use CT, they use some other methodology, but the result was for the most part gorgeous.  And that wasn't because of their CT-like tech -- it was because the display was insanely high resolution in a smaller form factor (2880x1800 @ 15&quot;).  &quot;So why don't you use a Mac?&quot; -- because I can't get anything done on it, I'm too used to my existing methods for getting things done using a combination of Windows and *IX, and I was spending 90% of my time &quot;fighting&quot; with the OS to accomplish tasks that would take me mere seconds on Windows/*IX.  So despite being a great piece of hardware, the usability hit for me was too major and too frustrating.  (I'm the <strong>only</strong> employee at my workplace who uses Windows for a workstation, by the way -- that has prompted more than one discussion in itself)

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />For the most part I don't give a damn about the difference between operating systems. As long as they work sufficiently well, the only critical thing is what software they run.<br /><br />I use Windows 7 primarily, but I also frequently use Android, Windows 8, Ubuntu, and OS X, and some other things less frequently. I have a lot of preferences in reaction to the differences between them, and sometimes the preferences are quite strong (as with ClearType), but those things aren't a dealbreaker. Not being able to run software I like is the dealbreaker.<br /><br />If Windows 7 was as incompatbile with new software as XP has become, I would switch to Windows 8 in a heartbeat, even though I have a strong preference against it.<br /><br />The idealist in me wishes we'd all switch to Linux, but I'm not going to forego the use of my favourite programs for that ideal.
