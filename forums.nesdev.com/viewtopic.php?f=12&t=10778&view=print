		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I'm putting the finishing touches on a project that has taken far longer than it should have, and just felt like showing off a little.  This is a Cx4 dev board commissioned by byuu, and I finally got all of the hardware assembled and a ROM burned to it (I burned the ROM before mounting the chip to the board, I still have to work out the in-circuit programming).  So technically it is currently nothing more than a MMX3 (USA) repro using RMX3 (Jap) donor, but it will (hopefully) be reprogrammable through the cart edge when I'm done for dev purposes.  Sadly, there are no MMX2/3 hacks that actually run on hardware (SUPER bummed that the MMX3 Zero hack doesn't run on hardware...), but these adapters also work with GSU-2 boards, so the same mod could be done there for a Yoshi's Island hack, or Star Fox 2...<br /><br /><img src="http://i39.tinypic.com/m9oy3c.jpg" alt="Image" /><br /><img src="http://i40.tinypic.com/e9ybms.jpg" alt="Image" /><br /><img src="http://i43.tinypic.com/23r8exk.jpg" alt="Image" />

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />It should.  The only potential issue is whether or not the ROM chip actually works with /CE grounded, because some Flash ROMs require a falling edge on /CE for every cycle.  I'm going to try one out soon, but I really need to get my TSOP socket mounted onto a carrier board so I can use it for programming the chips, rather than my current method of soldering it onto an adapter board, programming it on the adapter, desoldering from the adapter, then re-soldering it to the final board... because that's getting super annoying (but it's my only option until I can afford PCB's for the TSOP socket).  If it does work, I should be able to build a Star Fox 2 cart with one of these, as well as any other SFX games <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /> (not sure if there's really any worth making... maybe YI hacks?)

So it wouldn't be reprogramable in circuit but it was a lot cheaper to make.  Both versions can mount to stunt race, yoshi's island, doom and winter gold carts.

I was really happy to find that SeeedStudio was able to handle edge castellations for my boards, but I'm always looking around for other options.</div><br /><br />I started out in my early designs with edge plating but it was too expensive and very problematic.  Switched to half plated holes on the edges and it was cheaper and much easier to solder too as well as more forgiving to hot irons.<br /><br />I use &quot;10pcb.com&quot;    They don't do edge plating in house but source it out if you want it.  If you zoom in on the non-buss-switch picture I previously posted, you can see the left half holes that aren't mounted on stunt race cart.   10pcb isn't the cheapest but they do quality work.  I used a cheaper place once and the quality difference was very evident.  HIGHLY recommend the half holes.<br /><br />My pcb's are .031 thick.  The no buss switch is 2 layer and the one with the buss switch (so it can be re-programmed in circuit) is 4 layer.  That buss switch ic is a bitch to mount by hand! <br /><br />Here is my pcb on a Doom cart with a SRAM circuit I also had made.....  The SRAM pcb uses the edge plating, so you might be able to see a soldering difference in this pic since both edge plating and half hole are in this pic.<br /><br />Edit:  sorry... I thought the SRAM board was my version1.... It's not so disregard the edge plating part as version 2 of my SRAM board got the half holes as well

Vortex, doom, Yi, etc..... All but the original starfox cart.  So you could remove the SRAM and mount this pcb and it'll function as a multi-bank SRAM for multiple save banks and has a save circuit for the games that don't have a save circuit -- like Doom or Vortex.<br /><br /><br />My older versions also have a standard 3 EPROM option too.  I can post those pics if wanted..<br /><br />This pic shows the edge plating on both pcb's.....

They ship DHL which is ridiculously fast.  I usually get my packet in 2 days.  They charge about $20 for that shipping.<br /><br /><br />Edit:  I looked at your post again.... Hard for me to see the &quot;half hole&quot; on yours.<br />Do you Have a close up pic?
