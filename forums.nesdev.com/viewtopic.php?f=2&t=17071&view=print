And I am lead to believe that this is the very best place to recruit coders, artists and musicians to work on these new games.<br /><br />So do you have a NES game you would like to get professionally published where you can get paid and earn generous royalties on every cartridge sold? <br />Maybe you would love to port Epyx classics such as Temple of Apshai, Jumpman, Pitstop, Death Sword (Barbarian), Slime World, World Karate, Super Cycle or California Games II to the NES?<br />Or perhaps you would like to get involved in producing cartridges, PCBs or designing boxes for these games?<br /><br />If you answered yes to any of the above or you have any questions then please reply or get in contact with me to discuss further!<br /><br /><img src="https://i.imgur.com/NEMXOEr.png?1" alt="Image" />

We are happy to pay people for their work and have done on several projects already, some people prefer to get higher royalty based payments instead. But either way it's negotiable.  <br /><br />The bottom line is you will get paid and this will be fully above board with legal contracts and agreements.
