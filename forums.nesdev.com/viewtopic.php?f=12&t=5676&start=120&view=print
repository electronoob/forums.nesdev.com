		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Thanks Mottzilla 
<br />
<br />The problem you explain is like when I'm putting a ntsc game on a Pal console or vice versa, no problem to understand this.
<br />
<br />I've just miss a thing, i've put the 12f629 on a "simple" original Pal game (Dragon Ball Z -the game is in french-, only 1 rom and a D413 CIC (originally) on board).
<br />
<br />The strange things for me, is that the game start in ntsc but not in pal, its original region. That why i would like to change the code in the asm file (I've seen some 09 for NTSC and 06 for PAL) but impossible to compile it for me (i've tried with Mplab..but errors appears) maybe can Ikari01 tell me which software i should use to make a proper hex file ?

<br />
<br />The CIC clone on the cartridge will switch to PAL. The game will probably not boot before you push reset but that's irrelevant.
<br />Afterwards the SuperCIC will detect the clone as a PAL CIC and switch to PAL accordingly.

<br />
<br />So I've tested this and I've added the led on the 12f629 (pin 3 of the 12f629).
<br />
<br />Again, the key seems to works only in my switched snes and only in NTSC. I tested with two 12f629 (just in case) but the games refuse to start in pal on my original PAL SNES or with my "switched" SNES forced in pal...   <img src="./images/smilies/icon_confused.gif" alt=":?" title="Confused" />  In ntsc the led is OFF when I put the game in a PAL snes (or switched in PAL) the led turn "ON". When I press RESET nothing seems to happen...always this fuc**** black screen.
<br />
<br />I 'm sure that I wire it correctly (very very simple soldering mod) so I don't understand why  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_question.gif" alt=":?:" title="Question" />

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />So to clarify: It does not run <em>at all</em> on a non-modified console?
<br />Then there's a communication problem between the Host CIC and the cartridge CIC. The most likely causes are:
<br /> - wiring problem (maybe Data0 and Data1 are swapped?)
<br /> - fuses setting on the 12F629 (especially clock source)
<br />
<br />The hex file contains fuse settings. You might have to force your programming tool to set them on the PIC.

<br />Thanks ikari_01   <img src="./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" />
<br />
<br />Edit. Awesome Ikari, it was fuses settings ^^
<br />So if anyone have a Wellon, change Oscillator Type in Config panel as a RC(GP4:CLKOUT) to make it working (by default set on "EC") !

<br />Or AVR. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /> That someone was kevtris and the CIClone was based on the reverse engineered Tengen CIC. Now we also know the instruction set and the behaviour of the actual Nintendo CIC since segher reverse engineered it. A clone could be based on either one of those.

<br />
<br />kevtris developed it, we have the code from the Tengen clone.  The algorithm was posted in C and assembly.  kevtris already released the PIC code for it at the time, it works by manually clocking the CIC.  Mostly it's only the timing in the program that needs to be changed for it to work synchronized at full speed.  So all the info is out there.
