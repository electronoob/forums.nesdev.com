		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I've been working for the past few weeks on porting MFC FamiTracker to Qt.  I'm doing it in a strange way, but it's turning out quite good.<br /><br />I've created a <a href="http://youtu.be/kalvDBlYWt0" class="postlink">short video clip</a> since a still-life wouldn't do the progress-to-date on this thing justice.<br /><br />Basically I've created a MFC HLE for Qt.  FamiTracker sits on top of that in darn-near native MFC condition, issuing MFC objects and believing it's in an MFC world [even down to CWinApp, CWinThread, CDocument, CDocTemplate, CView, CWnd, CDC, CFrameWnd, CString, CFile, ... all have been reimplemented in Qt-ways as adapters for the MFC-way].  This will make porting future versions [running right now is 0.41 but I see 0.42 has just recently been released] of MFC FamiTracker to Qt *very* easy.<br /><br />I must thank hyarion for his help getting the OSX build of this project working.  It's not quite there yet, but it's only a few short/simple Windows API replacements away from being there.  Then FamiTracker will run native on OSX, Windows, Linux, ...<br /><br />Enjoy!<br /><br />EDIT: Moved video to YouTube.

Is there supposed to be audio?</div><br /><br />I had the same thought RE other developers of MFC apps.  Yes, I think it'd be useful.  I am planning on releasing the MFC HLE as a Qt library when it gets to the point of being releasable.  Right now there's only implementations of the object methods used by FamiTracker.  <br /><br />I RARed the video because I was going to attach it to the posting but found that the forum won't let you attach files bigger than 2MB.  SO I just uploaded the RARed file to my site instead.<br /><br />RE sound:  No, I haven't yet reimplemented the DirectSound layer into SDL.  That's next on my list now that the CWinThread stuff is done and the player is functional.  Keyboard input in edit mode is also functional.  Also, all of the sound generation stuff including blargg's Blip_Buffer that's used is functional, so I expect sound generation to move along quite quickly, perhaps even by tomorrow.<br /><br />Then it'll be implementing the instrument dialogs, the configuration dialogs, and a CMenu wrapper for context menus and it'll be darn near done.  <br /><br />FWIW the source is up on <a href="https://github.com/christopherpow/nesicide/tree/musiceditor" class="postlink">GitHub</a> now...<br /><br />FamiTracker's guts are implemented mainly in a DLL, too, which will make inclusion of FamiTracker in NESICIDE simple.  Also...might open up the possibility of creating/using FamiTracker to play songs in whatever application you can think of.

Minimal/no changes, and it makes virtually no difference in any important aspect of the executable. Can you add an extra FamiTracker-specific layer that avoids any changes to it? So you have your MFC layer for wrapping this and other MFC programs, then FamiTracker-specific headers that do nasty things like #define foo bar(x) to basically edit the source code without modifying the source files. These headers intercept wherever is possible, possibly by being named say mfc.h (I'm not familiar with MFC header names), doing these nasty things, then including your outer mfc.h wrapper that does all the rest of the wrapping. Basically you use header inclusion as a &quot;come-from&quot; patching mechanism, where perhaps a particular file includes it and you insert a #define for that particular source file. Just some ideas based on my past experience with this fun minimal-modification porting method.

Unless you mean the document-view stuff, CFamiTrackerDoc, CFamiTrackerView, CFamiTrackerApp, CMainFrame?  Only the base-classes of those [CDocument, CView, CWinApp, CFrameWnd...] are in the MFC HLE.<br /><br />I will need to split apart the Qt/MFC event handling glue, though.  Right now I have stuff like this [example generalized] in the FamiTracker source files:<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">void CFamiTrackerView::mouseMoveEvent(QMouseEvent* event) // Qt mouse-movement handler<br />{<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;CPoint point = event-&gt;pos(); // Convert mouse-position from Qt QPoint to MFC CPoint<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;OnMouseMove(point); // Call MFC mouse-movement handler<br />}</div><br /><br />OnMouseMove is as-is from the FamiTracker source.<br /><br />For now I'm leaving them in the FamiTracker source, but it'd be nice to have them elsewhere so FamiTracker updates could just be air dropped on top without disturbing the Qt glue or having to do merge-diffs.<br /><br />I also need to figure out a way to hook in the ON_UPDATE_COMMAND MFC stuff so that the Qt UI elements respond [graying of menu items, etc.].<br /><br />Still lots to do, but lots of progress so far.  That keeps me happy.   <img src="./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" />

A &quot;window shell&quot; for it is in apps/famitracker [which provides the familiar FamiTracker application interface].  Also it is being integrated as a form into NESICIDE.<br /><br />Many things have been completed on the project.  I put up a Linux-build pre-release a couple of weeks back which failed dramatically for tepples but others have had success with it in Linux.  It appears I have some work to do RE SDL stability on slower machines.
