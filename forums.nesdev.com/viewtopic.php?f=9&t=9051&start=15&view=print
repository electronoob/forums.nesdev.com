I'm under the impression that using an EPROM programmer, a socketed board, and an NES modded to allow insertion of socketed boards is unbearably slow if you use it for every single build, and not every team has someone with the skill set to design a PCB.

<br />Putting sound in your mapper is only good if you're targeting only Famicom, or modded NESes. Probably most homebrewers here are not aiming for either of those.

Really, the thing that will determine whether your game is pirated is whether it's any good, and how many people get their hands on it. If it's worthwhile enough, somebody will crack it. Some people will want to crack it just for the challenge.
<br />
<br />To me, it doesn't really seem worth the extra development time spent customizing emulators, time spent ensuring reliability, etc. but if it's important to you go ahead and try.

<br />Really, we need to do what Pier Solar did and just make a mapper that no emu author will emulate. And make it expensive to do in hardware but easily hardware detectable. And then the best way to trigger it would be code your entire game engine like earthbound where it will only make it ridiculously hard and not fun if they pirate it, but yet not so obvious in the program/RAM map to the point where you have to NOP out one piece of code.

<br />You act as if your solution (Which you forgot to post I hope) is better than either of those. I'd like to see you create a better solution. I've thrown around many ideas for piracy protection for my own software, you think I'm not 100% serious about what I posted? Why would you even reply to me mocking my ideas and not even giving a reason why they're bad ideas? Prick move, that's all I'm saying.
<br />
<br />ETA: The mapper doesn't matter, you want semi-serious copy protection you'll have to do something yourself with your own hardware/software mix. And you should be able to develop on emulator and then add the protection when testing on a real hardware by changing one file from blank to the code needed, then use it as just a JSR function.

<br />
<br />The description of any anti-piracy technique is ultimately a description of how to crack it as well. Nothing is safe. Even things like suicide switches that destroy the game if you open the cart or read certain addresses can be circumvented. Many techniques are error prone and probably lead to a lot more legitimate user frustration (e.g. blinkies) than prevented piracies.

Seriously 80sFREAK, your participation in this forum is quite annoying. You only show up to say that everyone's ideas are crap, but you hardly ever explain why or say what would be a better way to do things. If you have better ideas in mind, just share them right away or shut up. Nobody thinks you are clever just because you're keeping information from us.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">You always talking about emulator.

<br />Because we use emulators for developing? Developing exclusively on hardware would be a very tedious task, and even if we could absurdly speed up the time it takes to transfer a new binary to the NES, we still wouldn't have all of the debug features offered by emulators.
