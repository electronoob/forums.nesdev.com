		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />This was brought up in my Yobo FC thread and I thought I should create another thread to flesh out this discussion more fully.  Personally the method I am looking at is a very basic custom PC with just enough hardware to run NES, SNES, Genesis, and N64 (and maybe Turbografx, etc.) and then a composite output converter to play it on a standard definition TV (no expensive HD compatible stuff) the way it was meant to be played.  The thread itself is to discuss the best way to accomplish this with a particular interest in minimal cost to achieve ~95% accuracy (tiny nuances in graphics and sound from cheaper hardware is acceptable).  In other words, a free ROM version of Wii virtual console.  Price estimates welcome and encouraged.

Basically its a mini itx board inside a NES shell.  All the ports go out the back, some people put the cd/dvd inside the cart area and wire the controller ports for USB.  The itx boards almost always have composite video output.  Typically the computers are underpowered for recent games (bad 3d acceleration), but work great for emulators.  EPIA boards generally run ~$200, add maybe $100 in other parts.  Definitely get tons of USB hubs so you never have to swap controllers!
<br />
<br />Other than that, get a Mac Mini  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Well shoot, if I was going to go the GP2X route I would just use my N-Gage QD (which I do use already).  I'm looking for extreme accuracy and authenticity at least for 16-bit and prior and pretty decent accuracy for N64.  This would mean hardware acceleration is a must.  What do you think about used PCs?  you think I could find something suitable from a used computer store?  I actually have a PC laptop thats 2 or 3 years old that runs N64 emulators fine, it just takes FOREVER to boot because it used to be my dad's and it has all of this auto-update shit that constantly runs and ties up the CPU.  Do you think I could just reinstall Windows XP with a minimal install and it would boot in 1~2 minutes?  My idea behind the custom PC is that it would boot almost instantly more like a console rather than a normal PC that can take minutes to turn on and off because of all of the software.  Also I wanted the aesthetic appeal of knowing that the PC was purely for emulation.

<br />17daysold, if you want to use the laptop, format everything &amp; install Win2K or ReactOS.  If you install Win2K, disable all network services &amp; be sure to install the latest DirectX 9.0C redistributable from Microsoft.com.  Oh, &amp; drivers, etc etc...

<br />
<br />You should be able to easily get fresh XP install down to 30 secs boot time.  There are tons of services you can turn off.  Finding a system that sleeps and wakes correctly would be faster, laptop should do that fine.  Adding the composite output to a laptop is harder tho.  The main issues with just used desktop PCs would be the size and noise.  If its hidden or inside a cabinet that may not matter.

When its properly emulated (emulating all the various CPUs and other hardware), the system requirements will probably go up vs what it is right now for the current "HLE" emulators.

It has better game compatibility than NOAC based clones, but it is still not as accurate as Nestopia... and definitely no replacement for a real NES.
