Today's secret word please, Conky:<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">  gencycle</div><br /><br />The Super NES dot rate is the same as that of the NES: 3/2 Fsc, or 945/176 = 5.369 MHz. The master clock rate is four times that, and cycles take six or eight master clocks depending on whether they access slow memory (RAM or slow ROM); fast ROM and internal operation cycles always take six clocks. This gives an effective CPU rate somewhere between 2.7 and 3.6 MHz.<br /><br />Because of the 68000's state machine, we can consider the Genesis to have a master clock of 7.67 MHz and actually run at 1.92 MHz, where each cycle of the internal state machine takes 4 master clocks. But how exactly is the 7.67 MHz rate related to the pixel clock? It's slightly faster than the Amiga and TG16 clock speed of 2*Fsc = 7.159 MHz. The dot rate in 256px mode is the same as the NES and Super NES, and the dot rate in 320px mode is 5/4 that: 6.712 MHz. Is the 68000 clock suposed to equal 8/7 of this 320px dot rate, which would equal 10/7 times the 256px dot rate or 15/7*Fsc?<br /><br />To derive a clock speed useful for comparison between the Super NES and Genesis, I derive an abstract unit called the <strong>gencycle</strong> (AAAAAAAAA!), which is 1/2 of a fast (6 clock) cycle (that is, 7.159 MHz) or 1/3 of a slow (8 clock) cycle (that is, 8.054 MHz). Over the long run, the average period of a gencycle should be close to that of a Genesis master clock, allowing 65816 instruction timings to be quoted in units nearly commensurate with 68000 timings.<br /><br />This 12-clock 68000 instruction corresponds to 10 or 12 65816 gencycles, as seen here:<br /><br />Ordinary direct page instruction: 10 gc<br /><ol style="list-style-type: decimal"><li>opcode fetch: 2 gc (fast ROM) </li><li>offset fetch: 2 gc (fast ROM) </li><li>data low: 3 gc (slow RAM) </li><li>data high: 3 gc (slow RAM) (if 16-bit M/X) </li></ol>Direct page instruction, D not 256-byte aligned: 12 gc<br /><ol style="list-style-type: decimal"><li>opcode fetch: 2 gc (fast ROM) </li><li>offset fetch: 2 gc (fast ROM) </li><li>address generation: 2 gc (internal) </li><li>data low: 3 gc (slow RAM) </li><li>data high: 3 gc (slow RAM) (if 16-bit M/X) </li></ol>Absolute indexed instruction: 12 gc<br /><ol style="list-style-type: decimal"><li>opcode fetch: 2 gc (fast ROM) </li><li>address fetch low: 2 gc (fast ROM) </li><li>address fetch high: 2 gc (fast ROM) </li><li>data low byte: 3 gc (slow RAM) </li><li>data high byte: 3 gc (slow RAM) (if 16-bit M/X) </li></ol><br />But to what extent do direct MOVEs, adds and subtracts with a memory destination, hardware MULs and DIVs, and 32-bit addition and subtraction give 68000 the edge?<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=9">tepples</a> — Fri Apr 06, 2012 6:44 pm</p><hr />

Okay, I was wrong with the 1% thing, but it does take less than 1% for a post-NES system to perform a collision detection between 2 sprites.<br /><br />I counted that the 65816 takes about 30 cycles to do a rectangular box collision algorithm.

I think a fairly considerable amount of time is spend "building" the sprite list each frame, atleast depending on the game. If you have more complex sprites, just moving a character like Sub-Zero in Mortal Kombat requires perhaps a different number of total sprite cells depending on the animation frame, and even if the animation frame is the exact same from one frame to the next you have to move each cell. And you aren't going to move a sprite by only modifying the X/Y coordinates unless in some very special case.<br /><br />You'll going to draw characters instead with a function that takes a position and "meta sprite" definition and draw that character where needed. Now this isn't going to take all your time, but it will take some time. Calculating collisions and going through the whole list of potential collisions could take alot of time too.<br /><br />Really it all depends how you spend your time and how well you optimize and eliminate waste of cpu time. You only have so much time to draw the sprites, process all game logic including collisions and movements, uploading new vram data, etc. <br /><br />Nothing is free or instant. Any action is going to take some cpu time. The SNES has little CPU time to spare since it will range between 2.68mhz and 3.58mhz on average. The Genesis doesn't exactly have time to burn either. <br /><br />The whole reason this is brought up is because of non-technical understanding fanboys spouting the same old hype. All they need is that clock speed number of the CPUs to justify that the Genesis has a "much faster processor" or whatever. Nevermind the totally different design and how it all applies to programming a video game.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=1726">MottZilla</a> — Fri Apr 06, 2012 12:35 pm</p><hr />

'Less than 1%' sounds very optimistic to me. That's 512 to 640 bytes, and in case with the SNES it arranged in not very convinient way (one bit of the X is packed these bits and sizes of with three other sprites).<br /><br />Rough calculation for Genesis. 7.68 MHz, 128000t per frame, memory write opcode is ~10t (varies a lot). 12800 bytes written per frame / 640 bytes of sprite list = 20 times of the sprite list size per frame, one sprite list is 5% in the best case (doing nothing but writting data, like clearing or copying the list). Is my math seriously off?<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=4205">Shiru</a> — Fri Apr 06, 2012 11:26 am</p><hr />

Didn't play it much, though. I remember the third better.<br /></div><br /><br />It's a nice game.  It's just that the SNES has tons of games with more sprites and less slowdown, than ThunderForce 4.  You just have to dig a little deeper than just playing arcade ports and Capcom/Konami classics.</div><br /><br />Not to mention games like the Parodius one that uses SA-1 which I don't recall any slowdown in. Some people really read a bit too much into the SNES's slowish CPU or overestimate the Genesis's cpu for being "fast". Plenty of Genesis games have slowdowns. The 68000 at around 7.5mhz isn't exactly lightening fast. The 12mhz 68000 in the Sega CD starts to make the SNES cpu really look slow but then if you are counting add-ons give the SNES the SA-1 and it doesn't look so bad.<br /><br />It all comes down to how the game is programmed anyway. You can certainly have slowdowns even if you are on a platform with a faster CPU if you waste time.</div><br /><br />I like this post.<br /><br />It takes less than 1% of a frame for any post-NES system for the CPU to touch every byte in the sprite attribute table atleast once, and the spacial difference a sprite moves from one frame to the next has no impact on how long it took the CPU to "touch" that sprite.  Collision detection between 2 sprites doesn't take very long either.  I think the cpu usually spends more time looking for objects to apply the collision detection to, than it does actually calculating collision, and even that can be illiminated by storing "bullet objects" in a seperate batch of object slots.<br /><br />Speaking of objects slots, I know a little speed trick that can be done on the 65816 but not on a 6502 or 68000.  I like to move the direct page to the object slot of the object to be processed.  This way I can easily reach everything in the object slot, and when I have two identical objects, it tricks the CPU into thinking it's writting into the same registers when it isn't.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=4383">psycopathicteen</a> — Fri Apr 06, 2012 10:58 am</p><hr />

It's just that the SNES has tons of games with more sprites and less slowdown, than ThunderForce 4.  You just have to dig a little deeper than just playing arcade ports and Capcom/Konami classics.</div><br /><br />Not to mention games like the Parodius one that uses SA-1 which I don't recall any slowdown in. Some people really read a bit too much into the SNES's slowish CPU or overestimate the Genesis's cpu for being "fast". Plenty of Genesis games have slowdowns. The 68000 at around 7.5mhz isn't exactly lightening fast. The 12mhz 68000 in the Sega CD starts to make the SNES cpu really look slow but then if you are counting add-ons give the SNES the SA-1 and it doesn't look so bad.<br /><br />It all comes down to how the game is programmed anyway.
