<br />
<br />Also, some results may very from unit to unit, for exemple it's well known that the initial palette values are proper to a NES, because they all flashes in different colors.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Yeah, it's too bad I don't have a second US NES, perhaps even a top-loader. I do have a PAL NES and hope to test on it soon. I predict what tepples predicts, that the times will correspond to particular scanlines. Today I'm going to find whether the timing is the same if power is left off for a while between tests, down to a single PPU clock. I'm hoping that the variation was just due to not powering off long enough. If this is the case, it would allow for reliable movie recording and playback between the emulator and NES (either direction), which would be really cool.

<br />Shouldn't come as a big surprise I guess since it most likely works differently on Famicom consoles. Just tought it I'd list them anyway in case someone finds this useful.

<br />Edit: added CRCs

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />In my emulator at least, Air Fortress (J) works at power but fails at reset, while Air Fortress (U) works after both. The init code has been changed for the US version, inserting 2 extra VBL wait loops. Since VBL could be set at reset, the first might not wait at all. The second would then wait for the first flag setting, where the registers still wouldn't work. The second two loops are needed, and a read of $2002 before them, which the first loop provides. Their loops also wait until the flag becomes unset, maybe just to be on the safe side, having been bitten by this.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Well, that's somewhat fun. Also, all games that have a lda $2002 - bmi loop, the only way this branch can be taken more than once is in Nesticle. I wonder why they waster ROM to put this.
<br />
<br />Also I've noted the Reset code of many commercial games is somewhat messy. A lot of games does write zero to $2000 and $2001 many times (I now understand that to be sure 2 times are needed, one at reset and one after a couple of frames in cases if the original writes were ignored). However, many games also do stuff like init the stack pointer, set the i flag, clear the d flag up to 3 times (usually each Reset code jumps to a secondary Reset code with redudency tasks, etc...).

<br />They fail only when reset is pressed. On <em>power</em> I'm taking the off-for-more-than-20-secs route, allowing writes go through immediately. The emulator passes your tests in ppu_power_reset3.zip.
<br />
<br />AFAIK, all of them are (J) releases but I've edited my post to include their CRCs in case anyone wants to double check. The (U) and (E) versions (including Balloon Fight) work fine.

<br />Example: the VBlank flag. The wiki says "unchanged" on reset. By pressing reset one time, it passes; if I press a second time, it says "should be zero". The 2003h is the same.
