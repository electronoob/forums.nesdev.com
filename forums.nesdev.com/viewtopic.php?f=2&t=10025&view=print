		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I hacked the nes version of Tetris, to uae SRAM for its score saving and loading. I also have some player 2 registers that reside within the SRAM.<br /><br />I modified the rom to use MMC3_118.<br /><br />Now my rom works on an actual RetroPak (needs already created .sav for SRAM, it works on Nintendulator, and the latest build of FCEUX.<br /><br />Someone contacted me, saying they tried to install my work on a tksrom board, and he told me the scores and names are all screwed up, and player 2 has no tile flip functionality, and he said Nestopia gave him the same result.<br /><br />The code I have for my sram is A980 8D01A0.<br /><br />So I looked at my reset vector and I placed the code there, before I do any kind of modification to the sram. I boot the rom, and I get the same error. It seems like all of $6000-$7FFF is filled with 60's, cause thats the tile id that shows up where the names and scores should be.<br /><br />I checked the nestopia log, and it does notice the A001, and loads the .sav.<br /><br />I am so lost. Id appreciate any suggestions. Thank You. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":-)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />-infidelity

All the slot for high score seem to be set to 0606060. I wasn't able to beat this score so I am not sure if it would overwrite those value or if it's really a bug in the sram check routine.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I looked at that ROM and also found the problem, I was going to make a version that added SRAM but still...you need to enable SRAM on MMC3 before you do anything, but I think you did that. Why do you need to run code from it, though? No free space in ROM and can't just change the interrupt vector to boot to it first? Any step by step process of what happens/doesn't work? As I'm kind of mixed up at what the exact problem is.<br /><br />ETA: Also, if possible, just make it mapper 4. Nobody wants to take extra steps to make a repro when it could have been done completely fine on a standard MMC3 board.<br /><br />ETA: The problem is you mess with SRAM before you enable it. Enable it before you even think of touching it and whatnot and your problem should be fixed. I'd try to hack it, but I hate messing with writing around code, haha.<br /><br />ETA: Enabling MMC3 WRAM before I start the game didn't help...let me also fix the header as I remember that was a problem too. ETA: Nope. I'll keep messing with it until whatever...idk what to say. Also, it even better idea.

Just enable the battery bit in the header and there's no reason to use MMC3 or TKSROM.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Well something doesn't work...those variables are in SRAM? Then something is wrong with SRAM. You DON'T enable it in the beginning. I added that to a ROM and it still doesn't work, though. I'm not exactly sure what is happening honestly. Still, never said the bank swap is the issue. I'm just saying you can do it better to eliminate the need it to use an MMC3 board, because you use no features of the MMC3 which are not offered in the MMC1.

It needs some minor fixup—e.g. the high score starts as all FFs.
