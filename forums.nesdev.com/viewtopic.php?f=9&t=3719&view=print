<br />Ok, but he uses only ONE diode to drop voltage, as you can see below.
<br />
<br />There's a problem to do in this way?

<br />
<br />Is there any problem to use more than 3V through the battery?

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />The direction the diode is facing means the 5V from the console is completely blocked from going to the battery, the 3V from the battery gets through (and is turned to ~2.3V).  Usually the sram data retention voltage is ~2V so that works fine.  If you put 5V into the battery then bad stuff would happen.  There is also usually another diode to block the batt voltage from going back into the NES, or your cart will be trying to power the system and the battery will die quickly.

<br />I didn't understand only one thing: as you said, I'll need to put another diode between the battery and the GND. If I put it there, the battery will live like in a original cart circuit? Or will die soon?
<br />
<br />That simple battery circuit is only composed by 2 diodes: one between VCC to the positive of the battery, and another from the negative to the GND, is that right? Sorry, because I'm kinda newbie. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_redface.gif" alt=":oops:" title="Embarassed" /> 
<br />
<br />(both polarized corretly, of course)

<br />One diode prevents the Vcc of the NES from damaging the battery and the other prevents the battery from being drained by the NES and cart. crcuitry.

<br />
<br />Can someone confirm?
<br />
<br />And, just another question: the first diagram says that I must to bend up the VCC, but I'm using a TSROM, and the VCC of the WRAM are already soldered on the board. I really need do bend up it? Need to desolder it, or I can just to solder the diode there?

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Nope. Start back at your original wiring. The diode prevents NES power from flowing into the battery. You need the <em>same</em> setup on the NES side to prevent battery power from flowing into the NES when it's off. So wire a second diode in a similar way between the NES Vcc and Vcc on the RAM chip. The only thing that gets power either way is the RAM chip, at the center of this diode pair.

<br />Clear up a lot. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />
<br />
<br />I think my last question is that I'd state above, about the VCC. In my TSROM board, the VCC on the WRAM are already soldered, but in this diagram he tells to bend up it.
<br />
<br />Can I just solder that battery circuit (VCC to GND) without touch on the original WRAM?
<br />
<br />
<br />Thanks.

<br />Nope, let's go back to square one. OK, originally there is a RAM chip that is powered by the NES. You want this RAM chip to be powered even when the NES is off (albiet at a lower voltage than when the NES is on).
<br />
<br />Naive attempt: Wire a battery directly to the RAM chip.
<br />Problem #1: Battery is fed +5V from NES, resulting in explosion/leakage.
<br />Problem #2: When NES is off, battery is trying to power the cartridge and <em>entire</em> NES, so it drains very quickly.
<br />
<br />Solution to problem #1: Put a diode between battery and RAM chip. This blocks current from the NES into the battery.
<br />
<br />Solution to problem #2: Put a diode between NES power and RAM chip's power pin. This blocks current from the battery into the NES.
<br />
<br />You started out only solving problem #1. To solve #2, you have to disconnect the RAM chip's power pin from the board so you can put a diode between it and the original trace it was connected to. You can either cut and bend the pin up, or use a blade to cut the copper foil trace on the board.
<br />
<br />Once you're done, I highly recommend verifying that your circuit actually performs its duties. When the NES is off, you should get around +3V on the battery itself, at least +2V on the RAM's power pin, and very close to 0V on the board where the pin used to connect (the NES power line). When the NES is on, you should <em>still</em> get around +3V on the battery, and around +4.5V on the RAM's power pin.
