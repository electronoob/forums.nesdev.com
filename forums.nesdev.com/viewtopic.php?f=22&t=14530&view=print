		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I thought I'd share my progress with my first game for the NES, Falling Blocks.<br />This is a port of my game that I wrote for the ZX Spectrum - see here if you want to try that version out: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://github.com/soiaf/FallingBlocks">https://github.com/soiaf/FallingBlocks</a><!-- m --><br /><br />I plan on adding some extra levels/challenges that weren't in the ZX Spectrum version.<br />The game itself is essentially a variant of Tetris, but I'm adding some features which hopefully should make it interesting to people.<br />I only started learning 6502/NES programming last month, but as I've done assembly programming I had no issues with 6502, the fun has been learning how to interact with the NES.<br /><br />Attached is an early alpha of my game - just one level, with no special features - I guess it's really just to show that I've started  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /> <br /><br />Some notes about the controls:<br />Pressing Start in-game will switch on/off a ghost - this shows where the shape would end up if you were to drop.<br />Pressing B will swap the shape with the saved shape. You can't swap again till you have placed the shape and are on a new shape.<br />Tapping A quickly will drop the shape to the bottom (though you then have a brief moment of time to move it left or right). Holding A will make the shape move quicker down the screen.<br /><br />In the final version I will have a settings menu where, for example, the user can choice their preferred default behaviour for the drop button (always drop, fall faster while held, or mixture). <br /><br />The one concern I have about the game right now is sound/music. I made a test version where I integrated GGSound into my code, but I have no talent for producing music myself, so I guess I'm going to have to look around for suitable music that I'm allowed use. If anyone has any suggestions here I'd love to hear them.<br /><br />When I'm finished the game (or close to being finished at least) I plan on putting the source code up on my GitHub account.

In theory I could add the same functionality to the version (so for example people could choose to press down for drop), but I'm not sure if it would be worth the effort. Would people like having the ability to define the buttons?

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I agree with dougeff. Using the standard keys used by <em>Dr. Mario</em> and other popular falling block games is like gas on the right, brake on the left.<br /><br /><strong>DAS</strong><br />Left: shift left 1 cell<br />hold Left longer than about 12 frames: rapid shift left<br />Right: shift right 1 cell<br />hold Right longer than about 12 frames: rapid shift left<br /><br /><strong>Gravity control</strong><br />Down: rapid shift down<br />Up: move directly on top of ghost<br /><br /><strong>Rotation</strong><br />B: rotate left<br />A: rotate right<br /><br /><em>Dr. Mario</em> didn't have anything for hold piece. In the past, B+A has been suggested, or Select if you're not worried about 2-player on an RF Famicom.<br /><br />How did you decide what set of pieces to use?

But... you're probably not interested if you're aiming for a more classic Tetris. (LJ65 is quite modern in gameplay.)<br /><br />So... instead I'll mirror the others in saying reconsider your default controls. There's a lot of Tetris games for a d-pad, A, B, Start, Select button layout. Tetris (GB), Tetris (NES), Tetris DX, Tetris Plus and many more™ and most of them do what dougeff suggested. Considering most people that will play this have probably played one of those games, it's worth following suit to not turn off players of those games.<br /><br />Also, I found a bug. You can fast drop the next piece before it comes out. This seems like it'd be a neat feature, but it's hard enough to do consistently that I'd bet it's a bug: <br /><br /><img src="http://i.imgur.com/akUtK0Z.gif" alt="Image" /><br />Input display on the bottom left. I press A way before the other piece enters the well.<br /><br />Edit: Maybe tick your randomizer on the press start screen so the piece sequence isn't always exactly the same?

But I'll definitely consider making the next alpha release more random. <br />Thanks for the bug report, I'll have a look at that over the weekend and see if I can work out what's happening there.

Besides (maybe it's my emulator) I've had some debouncing problems with the DOWN key.<br /><br />I've noticed that sometimes you can't rotate the block in tight spaces even though the &quot;destination&quot; orientation would fit.  I don't know if this is intentional.<br /><br />Appart from that, looking promising.
