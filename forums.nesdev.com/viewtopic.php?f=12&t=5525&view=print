		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Hi guys, new to the forums but I'm loving this place. I want to try and build some of these eprom carts with 27c322 eproms. I was looking over ebay for a chip burner and saw these two.
<br />
<br /><a href="http://cgi.ebay.com/TOP853-USB-Universal-Programmer-EPROM-MCU-GAL-PIC_W0QQitemZ270432921587QQcmdZViewItemQQptZLH_DefaultDomain_0?hash=item3ef70ee7f3&amp;_trksid=p3286.c0.m14/" class="postlink">link1</a>

<br />
<br />will either of these support the eprom i want to use? in the device list i only see HN27C301 so i'm guessing neither of these support it. Can someone recomend a good dealer in the states to order a usb programmer that supports the eprom i need. thanks guys.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Thanks for the reply MottZilla. Wow a couple hundred, I couldn't throw money like that at this. I also just read that you can't erase eproms with the programmer, you need to use a UV light.
<br />
<br />How practical would it be to use nand flash memory for the mask roms? I saw a schimatic for adapting a tsop flash, but 4gb would be better.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />It's possible to use flash memory, but they generally cost more than eproms. I may consider getting some flash memory for a Star Fox 2 cartridge later because I can't figure out how to properly burn a file to an eprom using my Willem programmer. I also bought a UV eraser, but my programming software reads the eproms as not empty after erasing. I am using the USB power supply and haven't gotten an external power supply for the programmer. The problem could be that it's not getting the correct voltages for writing to the eproms.

Sure would be nice to write your whole collection to the nand and then strap a boot selector menu in front. Just wondering how hard it might be to interface a nand flash to the mask rom. I don't know much beyond building from a schismatic but this site has my interest and i want to learn more:)

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Something like you're describing exists for the SNES. The Super Flash Cart is a product made by Tototek which allows you to write up to 64mbits of SNES roms to the cartridge. The flash cart supports all SNES roms that don't use a special chip such as the Super FX or the SA-1. It can be helpful for those who want to have several games on one cartridge and not use tons of floppy disks in a copier such as the Game Doctor SF series or the Super Wildcard DX2.

<br /><a href="http://wiki.pocketheaven.com/NAND_and_NOR" class="postlink">NAND flash memory</a> is <a href="http://pineight.com/ds/block/" class="postlink">block-addressed</a>, not word-addressed, so it acts a lot more like a disk than like RAM or mask ROM. You'd need a NOR flash or EEPROM to act as the bootloader, and then you'd need a big ass RAM to copy things into. You'd have pretty much the same setup as a PowerPak or a SuperCard. I don't see any way to adapt PowerPak-style circuitry to fit onto a standard Super NES cart PCB, so the only things you'd be able to use from a donor cart are the lockout chip and possibly the case.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />If you just want to have all your SNES games on a flash memory card you're seeking the Super Wild Card DX2 with the DiskDual add-on. It is possible to equip the DiskDual with a CF card adapter so the CF card is basically a harddrive and you can load it up with whatever you want. 
<br />
<br />You shouldn't bother with thinking about making something new, if you are here asking about how hard it would be to make something like this, that tells you right there you can't do it yourself and no one is going to do it for you. There are lots of products and methods to do what you want more or less. They aren't cheap. I think you could get a SWC DX2 + DiskDual for around 400$ maybe. 
<br />
<br />If all you really want to do is play SNES ROMs on your console rather than an emulator you just need a Tototek Flash Cart or one of a huge number of "Copier" devices which will load games off Floppy Disk.
