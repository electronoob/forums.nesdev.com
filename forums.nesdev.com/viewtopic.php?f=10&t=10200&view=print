		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />The first toward making a demake is to replicate the battle rules, such as how damage is computed. Then map out all locations and dump all scripts from the original game. Then write an engine around these. You don't necessarily need to start with the engine used for the Chinese FF7 demake, especially given that it's known not to replicate the game balance of FF7 well.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">I think the demake would be more popular if it were a NES ROM than if I did it with a modern game engine or just any modern executable game.</div><br />What you could do is make your demake in a modern environment using NES graphical limits and then port it to the NES. That's how STREEMERZ: Super Strength Emergency Squad Zeta came to be. Mr. Podunkian made it as Flash game with NES-style graphics, and then thefox ported it to NES.

Regardless of the quality of the game, disassembling a 2MB ROM into something editable would be a tremendous amount of work.

Sony continues to manufacture PlayStation 3 consoles that use Sony's official emulator to play PlayStation game discs. (It was PS2 compatibility, not PS1 compatibility, that was removed from non-launch PS3s.) Nothing still manufactured by Nintendo plays Famicom cassettes or NES Game Paks.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />So &quot;has a CD drive and an emulator&quot; counts as more in-production? This is a strange line to draw. It's true that the CD storage medium isn't completely obsolete like ROM cartridges are now, but that's a rather oblique point to be making. Why does it even matter &quot;how much&quot; out of production something is? The discussion is about porting something to the NES, which is in the opposite direction it would be relevant (i.e. trying to port to something that is still in use). Anyhow, with what we're talking about in this thread, the data storage medium is not really the issue, and emulation is already a given.

This way you're guaranteed to have success when it comes out, and to not have any problem.<br /><br />I'm not saying this to be harsh, just to try give you common sense.<br /><br />In my opinion the Chinese FF7 pirate just proved that no matter how much crap it is, just putting the &quot;FF7&quot; label on something makes a whole fuss about it. This is a disgrace made to the original FF7.
