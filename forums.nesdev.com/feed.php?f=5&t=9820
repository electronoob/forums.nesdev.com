Well, the guy behind the Resident Evil 1.5 restoration project decided to released one of his older test build. It's not the untouched beta image yet. He's restoring the game using a almost complete beta version and fixing game breaking bug and adding stuff that wasn't yet in the official beta build in order to make it fully playable. The build he released is very buggy because that build apparently had issue with some of tee C code he injected (fixed in newer build according to him) and seem to be even buggier when played on hardware but we can at least rejoice to know that this game is not lost forever and won't stay in the vault of some collector. I personally look forward for one of his more recent build to be released and also for an untouched image of the beta. You can also see him show his progress on his youtube's channel (<a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/MrBZork" class="postlink">http://www.youtube.com/user/MrBZork</a>). I just hope he is not only testing his stuff on Epsx otherwise we might end up with something totally unplayable on hardware like most of those old SNES Rom hack from before BSNES.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=4859">SkinnyV</a> â€” Sun Feb 17, 2013 9:33 pm</p><hr />
