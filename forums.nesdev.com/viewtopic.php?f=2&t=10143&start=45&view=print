The key is how to still make the characters stand out and look good.

Only Nes and GGear left out. It is high time to have a decent version Nes, Nes being reference in the Community, and of course to show that something was possible at the time and for bureaucratic corporate official was not performed.

However I still believe this game runs at 60 FPS.<br />As far as I know Street Fighter 3 and Mortal Kombat 3 Extra 60 are the only pirate games (in the &quot;vs. fighting&quot; genre) with excellent, constant framerates for the NES.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">Sik wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">EDIT: you know, wouldn't it be easier to just take that game and hack the title screen and music?

I believe a big hacking project (like people at romhacking.net is doing with the 8-bit Final Fantasy 7) could turn a tweaked SF3 turn into an excellent game. SF3 engine seems to be very good, stable and responsive. Much superior (in terms of performance) to any other Street Fighter 2 released for the NES.
