Semi off-topic, but: I like Mike (we've talked in DM on Twitter, and I even mailed him my old analog joystick for his Apple IIE), but his (and James Rolfe too) understanding of what <em>actual</em> homebrew is a bit lacking.  I don't think anyone's taken the time to write him something concise and with example that makes it clear to him.  Despite his on-screen demeanour, Mike's quite friendly and receptive, so I'm sure he'd appreciate it + explain in some video that he didn't have full knowledge of the situation + play some actual homebrews.<br /><br />It'd be important to explain the difference between &quot;repackaged&quot; games (read: not romhacks), and actual romhacks -- and the different tiers of the latter (ex. JP/EN/other translation vs. little kid hacks (turning Mario into a penis) vs. full-on and serious revamps (involving a LOT of assembly rework) vs. highly modified engines or maps (e.g. SMW, Zelda 3, Mega Man 2, etc.) that allow for practically creating a whole new style of that particular game).<br /><br />The more I think about this, the more I feel strangely inclined to do a video on the subject, given my weird one-foot-in-snesdev/nesdev-the-other-in-romhacking background.  Too bad I'm so rambly.

It's still based on someone else's code, but you have the full ability to change anything as if you had the source code.<br /><br />Just a really really advanced romhack?</div><br />Need clarification on this: do you mean literally this process and nothing else?<br /><br />1. Disassemble existing ROM (or use an existing disassembly somewhere)<br />2. Reassemble disassembled results into a working ROM file (and verified it's 100% identical to the original, if possible)<br /><br />If that's all that's done, then this isn't a romhack or homebrew, it's instead pointless.  :-)<br /><br />If between steps 1 and 2 there's some kind of modification done, then it's a romhack.  A good example is how I did the FF2j/FF2e intro for Neo Demiforce:<br /><br />1. Demi sent me an IPS patch with all of his work + the CRC32 of the source ROM he used<br />2. I applied the IPS patch to the same ROM<br />3a. I disassembled the now-patched ROM<br />3b. ...split it up into relevant PRG portions<br />3c. ...reverse-engineered a good portion of the existing intro<br />3d. ...reworked badly-disassembled stuff (data vs. code)<br />3e. ...commented a bunch of Square's functions, made labels for them (I re-used theirs due to limited free space)<br />3f. ...wrote the intro, as well as an RLE compression routine in Perl and an RLE decompression routine in 6502 since the graphics BiGWiERD did were too large to fit natively<br />3g. ...added my own code using <tt style="margin-left: 2px; margin-right: 2px; padding:3px; background-color: #3355aa; color: white;">.incsrc</tt> equivalent, making sure it fits, nothing breaks, blah blah<br />3h. Reassembled results<br />3i. ...made sure all label-ised addresses were the same (orig vs. intro-ised), just in case existing game routines happened to have something I missed in step 3d that would do something like JSR $addr where now it should be JSR $addr+12 due to the intro injection<br />3j. ...did a binary compare to ensure the only changed stuff was related to the intro<br />4. Made an IPS patch vs. the original ROM (so IPS patch included translation + new intro)<br />5. Gave Demi the IPS patch<br /><br />In this case, the romhack genre falls into the category of Translation/Translated, because that's what the goal was.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Well Homebrew does have a bad name. In that they are more &quot;look I did a thing&quot; rather than an actual commercial quality game. I've seen points made that there are so many other games from &quot;back in the day&quot; that while average back then are super cheap and still better. Homebrew is usually associated with pirates and hackers as normally you need those two to make homebrew possible. I speak from a place of privilege where Homebrew doesn't exist though. <br /><br />If you modify a game, its a hack. If you reverse the entire game and make modifications then its gets to a tipping point I guess. Garrys Mod is a 'hack' but its was such a big one that it became its own game. see also Counter Strike, and that base building game with humans and raptars that I can't remember the name of..  However as none of the Old Engines are released to use any of them means you need to hack them, so it could be argued that even if you completely change a game, its still a hack on X.

If I type &quot;Indie NES games&quot; I get mostly Retro Magazines, and sometimes Android games that have a retro look.<br /><br />Like it or not, professional developers are stuck with &quot;homebrew&quot; just to connect to their audience.<br /><br />And producers of hacked cartridges are stuck with &quot;repro&quot;.<br /><br />Sometimes Ebay/Etsy sellers will throw a &quot;homebrew&quot; label on their hacks, but I suspect that's to fly under the radar, to prevent their products from getting removed as an illegal copy.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Do not forget how people have now been saying that rom hacks and fan games are inherently evil, despite its goals. People who profit from work based on years of rom hacking research are now saying that doing a fan game is an evil thing to do. They say that doing some work that contains copywritten material is evil, even if you're just showing your love for that IP and releasing it for free, with consent from the original developers. It does not matter, you're evil. So it's natural that suddenly everything our dirty community does is automatically considered bad, amateurish and low quality.<br /><br />I've always thought that what this community excels in technical understanding it lacks in marketing. Internet presence and PR is based on marketing skills and proactive advertising. When you don't do that you're going to be an obscure hardcore nerdy thing no matter what. Gone are the days that media outlets would actually do research. Their research is now to simply follow select social networks members and wait for news. If we're worried about bad rep to the mainstream public this needs to be addressed.
