		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />During execution of my rudimentary game engine experiments, It will always alternate between a long calculation/AI/decoding routine in the main loop and PPU updates in vblank. It seems to me if I wanted to step through the code as it is executing in an emulator, I could start by setting a breakpoint at the start of each of these big chunks. When FCEUXD hits a breakpoint, I presume everything gets "frozen" that is, vblank will quit firing?
<br />
<br />Previously I had been doing something like:
<br />
<br />- jmp -
<br />
<br />after some point in the code where I wanted to check out what was happening in ram.
<br />
<br />but obviously this won't be sufficient in all cases.  Also there's the problem of identifying where the breakpoints should be; however I think if I just .db'd a string before each big routine I should be able to find it in the debugger..
<br />
<br />Are these techniques fairly common or is there something even easier out there? I'm also intrigued by the advent of lua scripting as described in a post in the General forum...I definitely want to look into that also.

<br />At least one of the FCEU variants has the ability to import a symbol table. Every 6502 assembler that I've seen can write a symbol table in some text format, and a quick script in Perl or Python might be able to translate the symbol table into the format that FCEU expects.

The writes are meaningless, but they will trigger the breakpoints and I'll be able to trace carefully what happens next.

Also STA "$4500" might work. And since those address ranges aren't used, if I want only some breakpoints to happen, I usually do "STA $5000" in one place, then "STA $5001" in another, "STA $5002" in another, etc.

<br />Do people realise that BRK was explicitly created for this reason?  And that the optional BRK byte (e.g. BRK $4A) can be used to determine the source of the BRK (for debugging)?
<br />
<br />Does this emulator offer stop/halt-on-BRK or not?  If not, retarded.

<br />(Sorry if I sound rude/crass, but that's the *entire point* of BRK...)

<br />
<br />Every single 6502, 65c02, and 65816 book I have indicates BRK was solely designed for debugging use, and the signature byte (despite being ignored, e.g. PC+1) used for determining what BRK statement got executed where.
<br />
<br />The official MOS documentation seems to imply that the purpose of BRK was to handle unique cases of EPROM flashing (since apparently zeroes were hard to deal with on old EPROM flashers -- this is outside of my knowledge set).

<br />
<br />I took your suggestion and wrote a quick program in FreeBASIC that converts ASM6 listings into FCEUX name list files. However, upon loading the corresponding ROM, none of the symbols get imported. I have the following files in the same directory:
<br />
<br />animationexperiment.nes  (a working demo I made)
<br />animationexperiment.0.nl
<br />
<br />Even if I pare down animationexperiment.0.nl so all it contains is:
<br />$8000#reset:#
<br />
<br />I get nothing. Have you gotten these name list files to work? I can't imagine what I'm doing wrong. I'll keep trying..

<br />If I only had one EPROM that can't be erased, but can be programmed to zero, I would use that for doing any code patches (change any opcode into a BRK).
