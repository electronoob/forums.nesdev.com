<br />This answers it. I was just unaware that your relative coordinates were unsigned. Mine are signed, so I have to calculate the high byte of each one, meaning I can't do it just once at the start.
<br />
<br />My coordinates are signed because I want to be able to put sprites all around the reference coordinate. You probably have the reference coordinate at the top left corner of the sprite, as that is the only way I can think it would be possible to have unsigned relative coordinates, right?

<br />This is an interesting idea! I'm not exactly dissatisfied with my current solution, but I'll keep yours in mind, just in case I decide I need more CPU time. Thanks for the idea.
<br />
<br />I just realized that moving the reference point can be just a matter of interpreting the relative coordinates differently. Let me explain. With signed coordinates, I could give the sprites coordinates ranging from -128 to +127, relative to the reference point. Now say that in order to keep my coordinates always positive, I move the reference point to (-128, -128) relative to the original reference point. So now the relative coordinates (0, 0) will be at the same location as old coordinates (-128, -128). 128 is the new 0, and 255 is the new 127.
<br />
<br />This means that this scheme is just as versatile as the old one, and once the relative coordinates are all unsigned, the additions will be much faster, because the high byte is the same for all coordinates and can be calculated at the start of the routine. And since the referent point is always moved by the same amount (-128, -128) there is no need to store any extra coordinates in ROM. This is pretty simple, and might actually improve the speed a lot.

<br />
<br />Yeah, I actually found that signed numbers are great because they're so universal, but dealing with them is a pain. For example, comparing two signed numbers is still a mystery to me. I don't really even care to know how to at the moment, because I've got a quick fix:
<br />
<br />lda VarA
<br />eor #$80
<br />sta Temp
<br />lda VarB
<br />eor #$80
<br />cmp Temp
<br />
<br />Though that's pretty slow, I seem to remember a legitimate signed comparison not being such an easy deal either.

<br />I use signed numbers for relative coordinates, but I don't need to compare them so it's safe. If you need to compare them don't use CMP but SBC. See the sign of the difference and make your conclusions.
<br />
<br />I use the center of a sprite for it's reference point and I am satisfacted that way, altough it really depend on the genre of the game.
<br />
<br />Tokumaru for the high byte you might come up with something like that :
<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">&nbsp;lda RelativePos<br />&nbsp;pha<br />&nbsp;clc<br />&nbsp;adc LowPos<br />&nbsp;sta LowSpritePos<br />&nbsp;pla<br />&nbsp;bmi +<br />&nbsp;lda #$00<br />&nbsp;.db $2c&nbsp; &nbsp;;BIT opcode &#40;carry untouched&#41;<br />+ lda #$ff<br />&nbsp; adc HighPos<br />&nbsp; sta HighSpritePos</div>
