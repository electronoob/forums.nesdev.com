		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />So one of my early motivations to make a programmable master cart similar to the powerpak was to make a portable NES that wouldn't require cartridges.  I was digging through a box the other day and found my old gameboy and couldn't resist tearing it open.  I got the idea to put the entire NES and "master cart" inside.  My previous plans for a portable were to use a slightly smaller toploader, but the thing would still be unreasonably large IMO.  
<br />
<br />Now I know there's NOAC's and all but the only hope for a good one is Kevtris' (EDIT and jwdonal's) whenever they get released.  But the idea I had was basically to put the NES on a 4 layer board and use surface mount components at a minimum keeping the original CPU/PPU.  I think it could be pretty feasible to even put the 5 generic logic chips on a simple CPLD.  The WRAM and VRAM could even be rid of if the memory used to hold the rom image had some reserved free space for them.  I'd say about 80% of the board is either unused, trace routing, discrete components, or connectors all of which could all be rid of or shrunk to effectively zero real estate.  
<br />
<br />Toss the RF unit and redo the video output to a small color LCD and I think I'd be in business.  There's lots of room to be gained in the gameboy by gutting out the battery compartment and putting in a Li-Ion.  You could even permanently attach a gameboy cart and gut out the space if needed.
<br />
<br />Anyways just thought I'd share my idea and see what you guy's thought.  I did have one question as well.  For the CIC onboard, is it needed to prevent resets?  Could I just toss it entirely or would have have to have it installed with pin 4 clipped?

<br />Sounds like a neat idea, but wouldn't it be easier to fit the entire Nintendo video-game-machine lineup on the head of a pin?  *Keeping* the standard CPU and PPU, of course...
<br />
<br />I'm just kidding, sorta.  It seems like there's been a lot of lofty talk with little chance of realization lately.
<br />
<br />I have a Commodore Amiga in my basement.  I think I'm going to go pull it out and post about how I'm thinking of gutting it and putting the entire Fred Fish library in the empty space of its Kickstart ROM using some compression technique I'll make up.  I think, if I tried hard enough, I could compress the entire universe of MODtracker tunes and fit them in there too...

<br />You can leave out the CIC.
<br />
<br />The CIC patent mentions cartridges that don't enable the ROMs until the key detects a valid lock. This feature was used by Super NES games using some of the coprocessors and by a limited-edition "Nintendo World Championships" NES game. But because it wasn't used on any retail NES games, Nintendo left it out of the redesigned NES.

<br />
<br />I can't bash you if it asked for your opinion and you gave it to me.  Being told it's unlikely to happen only gives me more motivation to make it a reality.
<br />
<br />I'll agree the chance of realization isn't great especially in the near future.  There's a lot I've got to complete before really diving into the idea.  Mainly I've got the cartridge side of the house before I could even start on the NES.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Funny idea, but it sounds physically impossible - mostly because of the huge size of 2 DIP-40 ICs.  If you have some creative way of mounting those chips, maybe.  I would think that multiple 2-layer boards stacked would do better than a 4-layer+ board.  Those big DIP parts will severely restrict part placement and routing.

<br />
<br />Yeah I was even considering two stacked 4 layer boards if need be.  The CPU and PPU will easily fit length or width wise but they aren't the only thing in there obviously.  The gameboy has over 5x3" and they are 2" each.  
<br />
<br />I wouldn't have really thought it was possible till I sized the mobo and the gameboy internals next to each other.  One of the biggest things I'm concerned about is improper placement/routing causing interference.  Wasn't there an issue with that on some version of the NES/FC?

<br />There is the "jail bars" issue on the toploading NES, and there's also the occasional wavy lines problem on my frontloader that affects only Battle Kid and PowerPak, not any licensed games.
