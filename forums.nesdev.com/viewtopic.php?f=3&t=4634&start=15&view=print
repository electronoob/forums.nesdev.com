<br />
<br />No, they are.  It's just impossible for sprite-0 hit or sprite overflow to happen on the prerender scanline because it's impossible for <em>any</em> sprite to be in-range on that scanline.  The lowest Y coord you can give any sprite is 0, which means it will be found in-range on scanline 0, then rendered on scanline 1.
<br />
<br />There's no way to give a sprite a Y coord of -1 (or lesS)... so no sprites should ever be found in-range on the prerender scanline.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />- Here! During the sprite CHR fetches (from PPU $1000, so A12=1), the loopy_v A12 is zero, causing multiple IRQ clocks. It's mostly 1,0,1,0,1,0... because the first rising (due to sprite CHR fetch) occurs at PPU cc 260; but at cycle 263, A12=0 because loopy_v A12 is zero.
<br />
<br />- In other words, CPU A12 (loopy_v) is zero, while PPU A12 (chr fetches) is 1.   This way, it's happening a 1,0,1,0... every 3 PPU cc, making the IRQ to clock more than 1 time per scanline.
<br />
<br />- Any help?

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Loopy_v doesn't matter, really, as it isn't placed on the bus during rendering (or at least, bit 12 of it isn't, since it's used for fine Y scroll).
<br />
<br />On any "typical" scanline, A12 will rise exactly 8 times (once for each sprite CHR fetch).  However the MMC3 IRQ counter is only clocked once.  It's unknown exactly how the MMC3 filters out these A12 rises, but the general idea is... if a rise is too close in time to the previous rise, it's ignored by the MMC3.  This way, only the first of the 8 rises clocks the IRQ counter.
<br />
<br />Every 8 cycles during rendering, the PPU performs 4 fetches for NT or CHR data (each fetch takes 2 cycles).  A12, at this time, is set to match the address to be fetched (read:  not anything related to loopy_v).
<br />
<br />The 4 fetches are as follows:
<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">cycles&nbsp; &nbsp;PPU Bus&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;A12&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; purpose<br />-----------------------------------------------------<br />0,1&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; $2xxx&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;0 always&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;fetch NT data<br />2,3&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; $2xxx&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;0 always&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;fetch attribute data<br />4,5&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; $0xxx or $1xxx&nbsp; 0 or 1&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;fetch CHR low bitplane&nbsp; &nbsp;&lt;-- A12 will rise here<br />6,7&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; $0xxx or $1xxx&nbsp; 0 or 1&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;fetch CHR high bitplane<br /></div>
<br />
<br />This results in A12 rising once every 8 PPU cycles for sprite CHR fetches (assuming sprites fetch their CHR from $1xxx).
<br />
<br />Anyway -- long story short.  The PPU Address (loopy_v) is not the same as the PPU bus.

<br />
<br />- Problem is... I put a check for loopy_v A12 at every PPU cc. From what you said, looks like loopy_v A12 is "ignored" when the screen is rendering..? If this is true, 2006/7 writes during midframe have no effect on MMC3 IRQs.
<br />
<br />- One more: at cycles 324 and 332, does the background need to be enabled for proper A12 rising, or <em>background or sprites</em> is ok? Yet, when there are less than 8 sprites per line, the CHR fetches fetch from $1xxx, correct? Like, if there are no sprites, we'll still have 8 A12 rises..?

It looks at the PPU bus.<br /><br />In fact... this is true even during VBlank or when rendering is disabled.  The PPU bus is all that matters -- loopy_v simply doesn't matter.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">If this is true, 2006/7 writes during midframe have no effect on MMC3 IRQs.</div><br /><br />Not necessarily.<br /><br />It just so happens that $2006 and $2007 update loopy_v <em>as well as</em> the PPU bus.

It's all or nothing... either rendering is fully enabled (which is true if either BG or sprites are enabled), or it's fully disabled.  All fetches are performed and all logic is done by the PPU when rendering is enabled.  And none of it is performed when rendering is disabled.  There's no in-between middle ground.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">Yet, when there are less than 8 sprites per line, the CHR fetches fetch from $1xxx, correct? Like, if there are no sprites, we'll still have 8 A12 rises..?</div>
<br />
<br />Correct.  The fetches are still performed if there are less than 8 sprites, just with dummy values (the PPU will fetch CHR for tile $FF).  With 8x8 sprites, this could be from either $0xxx or $1xxx depending on reg $2000.  But with 8x16 sprites, this will always be from $1xxx.
