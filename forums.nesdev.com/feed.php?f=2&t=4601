Hamtaro126, I doubt you'll find something ready to use. This kind of job will certainly require you to study the game code so that you know exactly what you have to modify.<br /><br />A basic routine that does what you want can probably be coded pretty quickly, but the hard part is exactly incorporating it to the specific game you want. That's because the attribute data has to come from somewhere, and that's specific to each game. Also, the time taken for the new updates must fit inside the remaining VBlank time (if any), and that time depends largely on what the game does during VBlank.<br /><br />So I guess there is no other way, you'll have to figure out how SMB handles attributes, and rewrite whatever needs changing. You could start out by commenting out whatever seems related to attributes, effectively disabling attribute rendering altogether. Once that's done, and the game is still working correctly (except for the resulting color issues), you can start writing your own routines to handle attributes as you wish.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=95">tokumaru</a> — Tue Nov 25, 2008 9:00 pm</p><hr />

Individual attribute updates are one of the more mind-bending problems I remember running into.  It seems like I needed a copy of the attribute table in RAM, or would have to read from VRAM (very impractical).<br /><br />Here's what I came up with when I needed it to work, and didn't care how.<br />It's the subroutine "draw_metatile".  Since it writes to the PPU registers (rather than to a buffer), it's not as useful.  It's ridiculously overcomplicated.<br /><a href="http://www.parodius.com/~memblers/nes/neslib.asm" class="postlink">http://www.parodius.com/~memblers/nes/neslib.asm</a><p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=10">Memblers</a> — Tue Nov 25, 2008 8:51 pm</p><hr />

I tried the ones in the main NESdev.com site, They do not have any good way of attribute rendering!<br /><br />Does anyone have an ''Up-to-date Renderer'' with Update (Sub)routines for Attributes? I really need one for a project.<br /><br />NOTE: It has to be rendering in the style of 16x16, not just 32x32<br /><br />NOTE2: The project is a SMB1 ROM hack (It is going to be a patch distrobution, Not a pirated ROM)<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=287">Hamtaro126</a> — Mon Nov 24, 2008 6:22 pm</p><hr />
