		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I'm working on a project, where I have vertical mirroring in place, and have a working irq split, where the top part is stationary for text, while the bottom part (the irq) contains gfx. <br /><br />My stationary top portion resides in $2000ppu $2400ppu, while my irq split gfx are located in $2400ppu &amp; $2C00ppu.<br /><br />I'm having difficulty with my ability to select a nametable from either the stationary part of my screen, or from my irq split.<br /><br />I tried adding LDA $2002, LDA $#01(load up $2400 nametable) STA $2000, but it doesn't work. I have this within my NMI. And I also tried the same routine within my irq split, but I cant select the nametable either.<br /><br />Could someone refresh my memory on how to do this correctly. I tried looking up the nesdev wiki on PPU registers, and thought I was doing this right, but I'm not obviously. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" alt=":-(" title="Sad" /><br /><br />what I'm trying to do, is have my irq split scroll from left to right, displaying gfx from one nametable to the other, then I perform vram updates to change the current nametable im having the irq scroll to. I have my irq gfx start in $2400, then I would have gfx written into $2000, so that when the scroll count enter either 00 or FF, and dec's/inc's further, that I have the option to toggle the current viewed nametable, to give the appearance of a smooth transition.<br /><br />Thanks for reading!

After that point, $2000 won't directly change the <em>Y</em> scroll, and $2005 alone will only make changes to the X scroll, not Y.<br /><br />The canonical way to split scroll is with a set of four writes to $2006, $2005, $2005, $2006 in that order.

If you're changing only the horizontal scroll, $2000 and $2005 will work fine. According to &quot;The skinny on NES scrolling&quot;, the coarse X scrolling, along with the horizontal name table bit, is copied from &quot;t&quot; to &quot;v&quot; at the end of every scanline.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />One caution: If you're using only $2000 and $2005 for horizontal scroll splits, you need to write a value consisting of the coarse scroll ($2000 bit 0 and $2005.1st bits 7-3) for the <em>next</em> line combined with the fine scroll ($2005.1st bit 2-0) for the <em>current</em> line. <em>Super Mario Bros.</em> leaves line 31 blank (and Vs. SMB and SMB2J squish the numbers in the font) because this wasn't completely figured out in 1985.

It would have to reload the corresponding bit in the address every line, since it would get changed by X increment over the edge of a nametable during the scanline. I misspoke, then.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />idk if im not understanding, but from what im reading it looks like you guys are talking about how to peform a scrolling background. My irq I'm able to scroll freely with no issues, as well as my main stationary background.<br /><br />The irq itself is not the issue, the issue im having, is I cannot change the nametable on-the-fly for either my stationary background, or, my irq split. <br /><br />I apologize if I overlooked something with all of the replies here, its just that I saw no mention of &quot;nametable&quot; which is my big issue, since I cant change it on the fly. Thanks for reading and for your help guys!<br /><br />Here is my NMI. Idk if im missing something, or if something should have been set within my reset vector, but heres my code.<br /><br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">SEI<br />PHP<br />PHA<br />TXA<br />PHA<br />TYA<br />PHA<br />LDA #$80&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ;mmc5 irq activate value<br />STA $5204&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;;mmc5 irq activated<br />LDA #$1E&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ;value for ppu rendering to turn on<br />STA $2001&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;;store 1E for ppu rendering on<br />LDA #$67&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ;irq split y position<br />STA $5203&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;;activate mmc5 irq split screen<br />LDA $2002<br />LDA $FD<br />STA $2005<br />LDA $FC<br />STA $2005<br />LDA $FF&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ;set as 00<br />STA $2000<br />PLA<br />TAY<br />PLA<br />TAX<br />PLA<br />PLP<br />RTI<br /></div><br /><br /><br /><strong>EDIT</strong><br /><br />OK there was an error on my part in my reset vector. idk where I got this from, (looking at ollllld notes of mine) but for me to initiate the NMI, it says I need to have at the end of my reset vector LDA #$80 STA $2000, then have a JMP to the LDA #$80. With that, my NMI fires up. So obviously I'm having a forced constant write to $2000 of the $2000ppu nametable.<br /><br />So, what I did was...<br /><br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">LDA #$80<br />STA $2000<br />STA $FF<br /><br />LDA $FF<br />STA $2000<br />CLI<br />JMP back to LDA $FF</div><br /><br />again to those that don't know me, that remark I made after the jmp is wrong, I don't use assemblers, I code entirely in hex. This is just to show my work to those that want it written out only, not in hex.<br /><br />So now I have full control of altering the current nametable, ONLY for my stationary background.<br /><br />I still can't cycle on-the-fly through the current viewed nametable for my irq split on the bottom of the screen...<br /><br />So what should i have within my IRQ to have free control of what nametable is viewable within the irq split?

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />You said vertical mirroring, so just to make sure that mean the nametables you want are at $2000 and $2400, right? If you meant horizontal mirroring, and you're trying to change from $2000 to $2800 or $2400 to $2C00, that's a Y split, which you have to do via $2006.<br /><br />Otherwise, put some breakpoints on writes to $2000 in your debugger and make sure what you think is happening is happening. If you posted a ROM, I'm sure someone here could figure it out.

I just don't know exactly how to prep my irq asm, to prep the nametable for $2000. Since I'm using the A register within my NMI for the nametable, should I use X or Y storage for $2000 within my irq asm? Thanks for reading!

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />It doesn't matter what register you're using, as long as your interrupt saves/restores any registers it uses (normally all three unless you have a special reason not to).<br /><br />Also, NMI or IRQ does not need to PHP/PLP. This is implicit in the interrupt and RTI.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Got it figured out. Again it dealt with the constant reset vector loop, where I have my jmp loading $FF which contains 80, and storing it over and over into $2000. The irq portion was never getting a chance to be loaded up. So, my reset vector now just jmps to the CLI I have, and continuously loops. I now have the complete freedom to change the current nametable for my stationary background, &amp; for my irq split gfx!<br /><br />Thanks! <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":-)" title="Smile" />
