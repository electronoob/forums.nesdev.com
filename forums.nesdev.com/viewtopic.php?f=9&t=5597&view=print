Whether you believe it's real or it's a cobbled together nes and famicom is outside the scope of this thread.  The idea of combining the two systems intrigues me.  However, since I've never so much as touched an NES-2 or an A/V Famicom, I have no idea how difficult it would be.  It looks as if you'd just need to replace the famicom's cart connector with the nes one and then put the entire thing into NES-2 housing and you'd be set.  But how hard would swapping the cart connector be?  Like I said, I've never seen the insides of either in person.
<br />
<br />Also, is the A/V famicom capable of using the US light gun?
<br />
<br />I'm just trying to figure this out before I plunk down good money on the two systems.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I speculate the model in question is a mod of an AV famicom...The layout is similar enough, but explaining the clean 72-pin connector and/or clean AV connector is another.
<br />
<br />To use a 72 pin connector in a 60 pin connectors place a majority of the middle lines have to be removed, which would look "Scrunched" if used directly...To use an AV output without RF you'd have to remove the RF block and replace it with an AV connector. The aditional plastic was probably taken from the AV famicom, but again pins would have to be rerouted.
<br />
<br />Unless someone can confirm or deny this unit, I'm at a loss of complete explination, but I can confirm that using a 72-pin socket on a 60-pin board would be tricky, but not impossible.
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />I cannot confirm if US/PAL Light Guns work in Port #2 or not, I'd assume Japanese light guns still work in the expansion port, though.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I have high res picts of that board and there is absolutely nothing to suggest it is anything but an authentic production system.  The Famicom AV, RF top loader, and AV top loader all have significant differences between the boards.
<br />
<br />In addition to swapping the cart connectors, which will take some major rewiring, the Famicom AV also has the expansion port on the side and likely a different power system.  The expansion port is probably hacked off pretty easy, and the power socket may be a direct swap.  Other than that everything else appears to line up.
<br />
<br />No idea about the light gun but it probably works.  If not you should be able to run wires from the Famicom expansion port to the controller port.

<br />I seem to remember hearing that someone had complained about the video quality with the toploader and sent it to Nintendo, and had an A/V version returned to them.  I'm pretty sure some other collectors had them too.

<br />I called Nintendo to complain about the vertical banding and they sent me one in return with AV out. I can't give a definite date, but I believe it was late 90's. Mine is in storage at my parents house across state. I'll try and pick it up at Christmas.

Plus I'm not sure you can mod the top loader for the extra sound from the PowerPAK or can you?

(For instance, in U.S. copyright law, see 17 USC 109.)
<br />
<br />But over the past few months, video game publishers have been up in arms about the used video game market, complaining that used copies of a game at GameStop and local stores unfairly compete with new copies of the same game and with a publisher's other titles. (See these slashdot stories: <a href="http://games.slashdot.org/story/09/06/04/236201/Publishers-Want-a-Slice-of-Used-Game-Market" class="postlink">Slice of the Market</a> and <a href="http://games.slashdot.org/story/09/07/16/1721215/Why-Game-Developers-Should-Shut-Up-About-Used-Games" class="postlink">Shut Up</a>.) If Nintendo is recommending that customers exercise their first sale rights, then either the industry is hypocritical or (I'll assume good faith here) Nintendo differs from other publishers.

I was really skeptical of scir91's a/v unit until a couple days ago I opened up a seemly normal unit only to find it was not normal, the motherboard layout is just like his a/v unit only it still has the r/f modulator installed. Interestingly enough, there are no lines in the video output. Obviously someone sent this unit in for repair and the whole board was swapped out. I suspect﻿ there are more units like mine in existence, but are rarely opened up to see whats inside. If you dont have "lines" in the picture from your top loader, check it to see if its been updated, you might be able to tell by looking into the vent holes in the rear of the unit, see what the rectifier looks like. 
<br />Check out pics of the unit I posted in a youtube vid.
