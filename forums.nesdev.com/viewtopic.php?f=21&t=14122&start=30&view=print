		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Thanks, it could be seen as such. This particular area is modeled after a non-residential area, such as an industrial park, in contrast to the prior chapter, which depicts a common type of working class neighborhood that would have residences above 1st floor businesses open for foot traffic. In fact, nearly everything in the first chapter is from a hodgepodge of references from my actual neighborhood. As for the palette shift, it also indicates an afternoon-to-night transition, which is shown in the chapter interlude screen. <br /><br />At some point in time, I will probably do some write ups on the details of the backgrounds. Some of them flesh out the script and puzzles. Many of them just add character to the setting.

It seems like the perspective is off. The darker green shade should be top-left, not bottom right. Or maybe I'm &quot;mentally rendering&quot; it in the wrong way.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Actually, you're right. The posts immediately adjacent to the fence clearly show a visible top, left, and front plane, and my fence was showing front, right, and bottom. Fixed it. Thanks a ton, wouldn't have noticed it otherwise!<br /><br /><img src="http://files.mteegfx.com/kgaTheOfficeBldgBG.gif" alt="Image" /><br /><br />Here's the next background, by the way:<br /><br /><img src="http://files.mteegfx.com/kgaTheBreakAreaBG.gif" alt="Image" /><br /><br />The blank space next to the compass is for inventory, by the way. I've been cropping out the items so as not to reveal too much about the puzzles of the game. (I also may selectively not post some backgrounds if I feel they be too revealing.)<br /><br />&quot;Backpack Contents&quot; will likely be the way that the bottom portion of the screen will be referred to in the manual. When it came to character design, giving the player some type of bag was a priority, as I wanted to avoid the magic pocket inventory concept. (Even though, at times, an item may be larger than the backpack, nothing so far couldn't hypothetically be carried in it, sticking out--although we don't depict it as such.) <br /><br />Backpack was chosen as the type of bag to reinforce the character's age (high school). If he were an older character, I may have gone with a satchel, or a duffel bag for a more athletic character.<br /><br />These little details are big for me. When I joined Pyronaut, even, I  replaced various sized hearts and shield icons with various sizes of first aid gear (all clearly shown with a first-aid cross) and actual armor (along with a small line intended for the manual about the planet's creatures having raided the ship's crash site like raccoons, explaining why they would drop human supplies when defeated). In fact, the other day, I was playing The Legend of Zelda (for the first time, surprisingly), and my wife asked me &quot;did you kill the dragon yet?&quot; To which I replied, &quot;Yeah, then I ate its heart. Now, I'm stronger.&quot; Although that interpretation was likely not intended, I much prefer games like Survival Kids (and I think, Morrowind, IIRC), where the items dropped by an enemy (meat), could make sense story-wise.

Apparently they're called <a href="https://www.trafficsafetystore.com/parking-blocks" class="postlink">parking blocks</a>, by the way. I had no idea.<br /><br />Oh, and further reading actually shows that using the red cross in video games for medkits has been an issue (despite it being pretty standard since at least Doom 1). That's interesting. May or may not affect our designs (currently designed in orange, but in-game, they flash through all four sprite palettes, which usually feels predominantly purple.) Anyway, not looking to spend time on Pyronaut now. Will keep it in mind though. Definitely not going back to floating hearts though. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />

Some private body could theoretically own the rights to that, but it holds a function more important than the function of private or national property, so it wouldn't be rational. I think the red cross could be argued being such a case, too, as it helps save lives. A red cross on a white background is a lot more functioning as a signal than pretty much any other colour on white. <br /><br />The advice to avoid rights conflicts by using red on white is very sound, nontheless. Just like avoiding doing tetris variations, for the time being.
