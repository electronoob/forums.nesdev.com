This is precisely the information about the MGD1 that I required. <br /><br />I may have been mistaken about the number of disks, but I thought it was four. Nomatter...<br /><br />I saw Tomy's FDS Copy Tool docs before, but as they haven't any readme.txt file, being not-in-English, I was perplexed at what they were about. I suspected they were adverts and base schematics for an FDS copy cable, but I didn't look closely enough at them to realize that they were for drive-to-drive link copying. <br /><br />The biggest problem I see with this method is the availability of the connectors that go into each FDS. I guess I could sacrifice two RAM-Adapter units, but I have a MGD-Link cable, so I'll go with that route for now and see what happens. <br /><br />I can't imagine that the slight signal loss will be all that important in going disk-&gt;file-&gt;disk versus disk-&gt;disk, especially considering the media. <br /><br />I have to set this up anyway, as I want to play around with making some changes to a few games and its the only way to do it. I need to keep my eyes open for any FDS IPS patches (such as T-Eng) too. I hope that some exist that work on real hardware, as the Deep Dungeon patch fails when done to an FDS image for the PowerPak, so I suspect it'll be the same for a real disk as well. <br /><br />As to wiring the TGD into a Twin, the power issues are likely to be the least problematic. Finding a way to secure all of the parts, wire it in, and ensure reliable data throughput are probably all more difficult. Heck, I could always wire it for separate power, if it comes down to that, but running off the internal VR would (of course) be ideal.<br /><br />I figure that as long as I feed the VR sufficient input amperage, that it shouldn't be a problem, but I'll need to do some more research on the TGD6 logic board design to see what I can do to make it work out. <br /><br />It would be nice to have everything in once nice, red plastic package though. <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />-Xious<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=4070">Xious</a> — Tue Aug 10, 2010 1:48 pm</p><hr />

This isn't my goal...<br /><br />My goal is to be able to use one devidc3 without either a FC or TV connected to it.<br /><br />I was told that the MGD1 can do disk-to-disk copies by itself, with no additional software required, internally just by connecting it to an FDS.<br /><br />All I want to do is confirm if this is true or false. ...<br /><br />I can set up MGDLinker and do it that way, or I can use Disk Tools with my TGD6+, but I was hoping for a simpler method using the MGD1, and if it is *supposed* to be able to do this, it isn't working.<br /><br />I need Disk Keeper, but once I get the MGD1 working, i can probably write it using MGDLinker...<br /><br />At present, I want to make a couple quick backups of games with saves on them, and I was trying to do this purely with the FDS and the MGD1 with no additional software or hook-ups. It would be nice if it works this way, but I only have the word of one guy that it is possible.<br /><br />I have every revision of the FDS: my primary drive (aside from the one in my Twin) has a 7201 IC with an early Rev 2 Power Board., so yes, it hasn't any write protection.<br /><br />I'm also pondering hard wiring a TGD6+ into a Twin system (AN-500R, to be exact) so that I always have the ability to play Doctor disk games like Akumajou Densetsu (4-Disk set) on it, without having to use an external FDS, but this is a side-project for a later date.<br /><br />-Xious<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=4070">Xious</a> — Sun Aug 08, 2010 8:37 am</p><hr />

For a simple disk to disk copy, I would just use Disk Keeper. You load up the Disk Keeper disk, then it asks you for the source, copies it, then asks for the <br />destination disk. Simple as that, and doesn't require the MGD1 at all. <br /><br />Is your FDS drive have the modification for writing disks?<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3485">RGB_Gamer</a> — Sat Aug 07, 2010 11:42 pm</p><hr />

Hi All,<br /><br />I've been trying to do a couple disk-to-disk copies on my MGD1 that I finally received from ToToTek,and I'm having some issues in my attempt to do this with the unit as a standalone device. This is the procedure that I'm using:<br /><br />1 - Attach RAM-Adapter to MGD1 and connect to FDS<br />2 - Apply power from a wall-adapter to FDS;<br />3 - Apply power to the MGD1;<br />4 - Insert a disk to read.<br /><br />I discovered that running the FDS on batteries does nothing with the MGD1, but on wall-power, it seems to be working...or at least somewhat:<br /><br />At first, a couple disks gave me spinning segment series, then an Error code. Then, after re-leveling the drive (all FDS hate being off-level and will spew error codes when they are leaning too far in a given direction.), when I start up the MGD1 and insert a disk, I get some status indicators as follows...<br /><br />When I turn on MGD1, it gives the status light like this:<br /><span style="color: purple">.</span><span style="color: teal">_</span><br /><span style="color: teal">|_|</span><br /><span style="color: teal">|</span><strong><span style="color: red">_</span></strong><span style="color: teal">|</span><br /><br />When I insert a disk, The MGD1 starts to read and gives status lights that look like:<br /><span style="color: purple">.</span><span style="color: teal">_</span><br /><span style="color: teal">|</span><span style="color: teal">_</span><strong><span style="color: red">|</span></strong><br /><strong><span style="color: red">|</span></strong><span style="color: teal">_</span><strong><span style="color: red">|</span></strong><br /><br />or like:<br /><span style="color: purple">.</span><span style="color: teal">_</span><br /><strong><span style="color: red">|</span></strong><span style="color: teal">_</span><strong><span style="color: red">|</span></strong><br /><strong><span style="color: red">|</span></strong><span style="color: teal">_</span><strong><span style="color: red">|</span></strong><br /><br /><br />Do you know what causes this? What is the meaning for these displays?<br /><br />I don't see any spinning segments, just an endless cycle of reading the disk, the drive clicking, reading the disk, etc. I tried a few disks, including various original Nintendo and Chinese disks, plus an original copy of SMB--and all of the disks fire up and load from this drive normally. <br /><br />I'm not sure if it has issues with my FDS unit, or what these codes mean. Is there a list of MGD1 codes somewhere, or is this lost in translation?<br /><br />Maybe there is some copy-protection mechanism still intact in the drive that I missed? I swapped out my modified Rev 3 power board for a Rev 2 that I had in a parts unit FDS, but no soap: It still gives me exactly the same readouts and I haven't a clue what they mean. I'm giving it 2-3 minutes to read the surface of a disk at present, before killing power to the MGD1; is that sufficient?<br /><br />Can anybody confirm or deny that these codes are due to copy protection in the FDS and not something else?<br /><br />--or--<br /><br />Could it be a dirty connection between the RAM-Adapter and the MGD1, or is something horribly wrong???<br /><br />-Xious<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=4070">Xious</a> — Thu Jul 29, 2010 2:28 am</p><hr />
