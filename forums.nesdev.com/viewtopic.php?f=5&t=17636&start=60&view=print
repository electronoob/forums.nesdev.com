I don't care which version of Windows is the best one if it's not the latest one since there's no point in trying to keep old versions running when MS <em>really</em> doesn't want you to. I had a bad enough experience with Windows 10 that I installed Linux again and found it to be pleasant and usable experience over a 4 month experience. (This was full time use during work hours, and split with OS X at home) Then again I've always considered the best version of Windows to be <em>not Windows</em>, so take from that what you will. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt=":roll:" title="Rolling Eyes" />

It started to fail when I finally could get an internet connection. It really pushed the OS hard!<br /><br />XP was nice, but once I had kids I just became tired of restoring/reinstalling every week or so.<br />Then I tried Linux. It was hard at the beginning, but now it's nice and smooth! <br />The PC in question is used for trivial things only like websurf, video watching, etc. No specialised things like video or picture editing. <br />I used to do small programming on it when I was at university, but after that just some shell scripting wich is a great upgrade to who used to use .bat files!

ReactOS can now build ReactOS...<br /><br />Apparently it could in the past, but that was when the kernel was full of hacks to make things work.  After the removal of those hacks it's taken until now for development to have progressed to the point where ReactOS's workings are sufficient to run their build software.<br /><br />I think ReactOS is one of those strange projects where it probably started off with people saying &quot;good luck to ya!&quot; to the devs trying to get the project off the ground.  It flounders for a while with little real development until it gets to the point where enough 'stuff' is working that more people start to get interested, users <em>and</em> devs.<br /><br />Now ReactOS has the starlings of a emulated DOS VM from which parts will hopefully develop into a compatibility layer for 16bit applications... hopefully on 64bit.  Even though the majority of the kernel is targeting XP/Server 2003, there are already compatibility shims in place that allow some Vista/7/8.1 software to run.

The only issue is when you need to reinstall it and windows update take days to update it (remember doing that once).  I would return to 7 but this is one step I want to avoid for now. 10 is working, when the telemetry service and super fetch doesn't decide to grind my hd for laugh or something.

ReactOS can now build ReactOS...</div><br />Looks promising ! However I really don't care if it can build itself, that's really the last of my concern. I'm more concerned as if it is actually usable, and if it is in the same state as earlier Linuxes.... we will have to wait quite a lot of time before it gets fully usuable. By then 128-bit programs are going to be obsolete, and any electronic machine is going to turn into a spying machine that uses AI to try to manipulate people's feelings and taste to sell them as much shit as possible.

Both are official Microsoft tools/things, thus no third-party reliance.  This is how I've maintained my own Windows 7 installation for several years now (for XP, I used the third-party tool <a href="https://www.nliteos.com/" class="postlink">nLite</a>, which was wonderful -- the W7+ compatible nLite is completely awful).  I have a single script I maintain (not taken from the Internet), <tt style="margin-left: 2px; margin-right: 2px; padding:3px; background-color: #3355aa; color: white;">slipstream.bat</tt>, that applies all the updates in a particular order (the order does matter).  This also includes adding several drivers (good examples are USB 3.0 drivers, AHCI/SATA drivers, chipset INFs/drivers, and NIC drivers).<br /><br />This methodology &quot;might&quot; work for Windows 10 (<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/manufacture/desktop/what-is-dism" class="postlink">documentation</a> implies it), but the fact remains Microsoft really doesn't give a sh** what anyone thinks any more, end-users or businesses:<br /><br />* <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/3293440/microsoft-windows/an-open-letter-to-microsoft-management-re-windows-updating.html">https://www.computerworld.com/article/3 ... ating.html</a><!-- m --><br />* <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/3294984/microsoft-windows/windows-updaters-express-frustrations-microsoft-responds.html">https://www.computerworld.com/article/3 ... ponds.html</a><!-- m --><br />* <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://www.askwoody.com/2018/patch-lady-my-response/">https://www.askwoody.com/2018/patch-lady-my-response/</a><!-- m --><br /><br />If you care about this sort of thing, i.e. aren't sure whether or not to apply a KB, <a href="https://www.askwoody.com/" class="postlink">askwoody.com</a> (and his Twitter account <a href="https://twitter.com/woodyleonhard" class="postlink">@woodyleonhard</a>) is the best there is.  In general, my patching methodology involves waiting up to 1-2 months before actually applying KBs due to Microsoft's recent-ish track record of adding telemetry or outright breaking things.  It just so happens that's the same model that Woody tends to advocate.<br /><br />I can't believe I'm saying this (esp. because I've met the guy twice -- did not particularly impress me, while Gates was actually super nice and highly technical), but I actually pine for the days of Steve Ballmer running the place.  There was at least, under his rule (and Gates' rule), a semblance of understanding that for businesses alone, sane/proper updating and stable updates were important.  With Nadella, I believe the motto is &quot;we'll do whatever we want, you're our guinea pigs&quot;, even to businesses.  It's the wild west with Nadella.<br /><br />Anyway...<br /><br />Apparently my double-entendre joke (&quot;So Linux is the best version of Windows? 'k&quot;) flew over the heads of everyone.  It was tongue-in-cheek, meaning it was half truth, half jest: I guess I'm the only one <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Azure_Sphere" class="postlink">aware of this</a> (this is not for desktop, but it's their proposed OS for IoT-esque devices, and almost certainly going to be used in upcoming XBox products).  Scared yet?<br /><br />But really, the problem with Windows isn't the kernel (that seems to be getting better all the time), it's everything else that makes up Windows on the software side that makes it a Sad Panda.  The part that's hard for all of us to stomach is that it doesn't have to be this way -- and we know that from 25 years of historical experience with Windows versions.<br /><br />ReactOS has historically been a complete joke, but in the past year or two, has *massively* undergone positive changes and is becoming an actual, real contender.  I follow it on occasion -- and don't tell anyone, but I secretly have my fingers crossed that it continues down this avenue because it just might be what I end up running someday.
