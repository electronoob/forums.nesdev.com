The basic design uses a MAX232 or equivalent to convert between the NES 5V and RS232 +/-12V signals. An alternate design uses an <a href="http://www.ftdichip.com/Products/EvaluationKits/TTL-232R.htm" class="postlink">FTDI TTL-232R cable</a> which has a USB connector on one end, and bare wires on the other with 5V serial signals. While more expensive, the cable can be made by literally just splicing it to a NES controller cable. With some heat-shrink tubing, such a cable would look very elegant. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /></div>
<br />Can you (or somebody else) enlighten me a little how this would work in practice. Are the RTS# and CTS# signals of the TTL-232R used at all? (What are those signals used for?) Also is the NES controller "CLK" used?
<br />
<br />I really would like to buy a NES&lt;-&gt;USB cable like this or make one myself. So many cool applications when used together with PowerPak.

In theory, you just connect GNDs together, NES strobe out to Rx on the FTDI, and NES D0 to Tx on the FTDI. Three splices you could do with just a pair of scissors and some houshold tape, if you had to. That's why despite the cost of the FTDI cable, I believe it has many advantages for cheap construction by anyone. Props to byuu for discovering this cable in the first place.

<br />Ok thanks. Let me know how your tests go. I ordered the FTDI USB cable a second ago so I'll probably test some stuff myself also.

You can of course build both to get bidirectional data transfer. The serial port I tested with outputs about +/-5V signals. The NES-to-PC output only goes down to about -2.6V, which isn't quite to spec, but it works so far. The diodes and transistor are common-variety small-signal.

<br />
<br />The schematic Blargg posted will probably work fine with 90% of PC serial ports, but I'd personally be careful using it with other serial sources such as vintage computers etc. because of the differences in adherence to RS232 between hardware platforms then and now.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Cool, flow control is actually working. I just made a duplicate circuit like the NES-to-PC one above and hooked that to CTS, and am able to have the serial receive run with as much delay as I want between bytes without losing any. The host gets garbage bytes in return, but it can just discard those or wait for a header if receiving any data from the NES afterwards.
<br />
<br />I also found a page saying that modern serial ports accept 0V and +5V as the two levels, rather than requiring a negative voltage, so the transistor driver above might not even be necessary.
<br />
<br />The next step is to try this on a USB-to-RS232 adaptor, and the built-in serial on a different PC, see whether it's just this computer's serial that happens to like this arrangement.

You don't have to mess with special drivers or communication models when using serial, so it's easy to port to different operating systems. That's not to say you couldn't have a microcontroller with a USB interface to the PC acting like a serial device, but giving the NES a clocked interface (maybe that was your point). If someone wants to release such a cable for the NES, please do!

I believe it can achieve approximately 16KiB/s but haven't bothered to build it. Surely a USB MCU is more convenient, but neither the software nor firmware will exactly be a breeze.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />OK, now that I'm using something more normal for RS-232 (was using my old Mac, with its RS-485 ports or whatever it has), flow control is working well. This USB adaptor (based on the PL2303) accepts 0 and +5V signals, so no driver transistors are even needed. Now, to try 115200 again.
<br />
<br /><strong>EDIT:</strong> Sweet, 115200 with flow control is working great for the initial tests, and there's plenty of margin for timing error (I can add/subtract around 7 cycles between the start bit detection and the data bit reads before it gets errors).
<br />
<br /><strong>EDIT:</strong> And passes the 4K random data receive test. 115200+flow control is where it's at!
<br />
<br /><strong>EDIT:</strong> I found that on my old Mac, when you deassert CTS, it sends 13 more bytes before it stops! This would explain the problems I had with it. I'm thinking this can be worked around on the NES side, by being ready to buffer a few more bytes after deasserting CTS. Going to try implementing that without lots of overhead.
<br />
<br /><strong>EDIT:</strong> Works. Even with the host sending an extra 13 bytes after deasserting CTS, this doesn't lose any bytes, and the processing code can take as long as it likes. This can handle the host sending up to 255 extra bytes, which is probably more than anything sends after you tell it to stop.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />i might add in that i've designed a Console &lt;-&gt;USB adapter (~5.5x2.5x3cm box + cables) which uses serial communication with the console and communicates with the computer with a ft232 chip (to make it as robust and cross-platform as possible).
<br />
<br />IIRC it should be able to transceive a byte in ~185 cycles, so it should be possible to make it quite fast. it should also be capable of being interrupted by DPCM every now and then without it interfering with the communication.
<br />
<br />would anyone be interested in such a device?
