I just thought that, in my case, such editor couldn't work because my levels are quite large. So the 8kb of RAM an editor would be able to use would not be enough to edit a whole level. Maybe it'd work if I had editors for each part of the level, and the output of one editor is attached to the ROM of the next. Would only be useful with emulators, of course.<br /><br />Could use a mapper with RAM bank switching too... since it's just an emulator thing.<br /><br />But in your case, you said you're trying to fit everything in 16kb of ROM, so 8 may be anough for your level.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=95">tokumaru</a> — Sun Feb 05, 2006 8:56 am</p><hr />

You could reserve a button to switch between the map preview and the editor.<br />You choose a metatile, then press the select button to land on the map, then click A where you want to paste that metatile.<br />You could also make an authomatic compression when you save your map to a .sav file. Google "compression algorithm" or something to get some fair ideas.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=38">Bregalad</a> — Sun Feb 05, 2006 6:09 am</p><hr />

I suppose you're right. I am making a completely new editor for multiple screen levels. The pain of making the editor with actual size metatiles is that it seems like you are zoomed in like a mile. Everything's too far apart. My engine for loading these kind of maps is going to load attributes depending on what tile is being loaded. Like tiles from $E0-$F0 use pallete 2 or something. I don't know. I still need to think about this for a little bit more...<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=138">Celius</a> — Sun Feb 05, 2006 4:15 am</p><hr />

Mind if I make some suggestions to improve this editor?  If you're gonna work on it anymore.<br /><br />It's great other than not being able to see most of the graphics.<br /><br />What I'd suggest is using 4-screen for the nametables.  The upper-right nametable could be the metatile selection screen for the cursor, then the other 3 nametables could be the editing area (and scrollable).  That way they could be displayed properly with attributes and everything.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=10">Memblers</a> — Sun Feb 05, 2006 3:31 am</p><hr />

A bit of theory:<br /><br />Absolute position input (e.g. Nintendo DS touch screen, Super NES Super Scope, Arkanoid paddle): These return one or two dimensions of displacement from the origin of a coordinate system. Some operate through resistance; others operate through timing against a CRT monitor.<br /><br />Relative position input (e.g. Super NES Mouse): These return an (x, y) displacement from the last read position. The software can integrate these to approximate an absolute position.<br /><br />In-out input (e.g. NES Zapper): These tell whether the cursor is over a light area or a dark area. Iterating which areas are dark and which are light allows you to distinguish up to a couple dozen distinct regions. Distinguishing more regions takes longer and can lose accuracy if the cursor moves while the code is narrowing down which region was hit. Some can also return the Y coordinate of the absolute position using timed code, but generally not at the same time as hit testing.<br /><br />Symbol input (e.g. Family Basic keyboard): These give a stream of symbols corresponding to "keys", or distinct absolute regions on the input device. The system is conceptually similar to in-out, except 1. the regions cannot be moved, but 2. the input is generally read closer to instantly even if the fingers are moving, making the input much cleaner than you would get with an in-out system that involves a TV monitor in the feedback loop.<br /><br />How hard would it be to support the Super NES Mouse in an NES emulator?<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=9">tepples</a> — Thu Jan 26, 2006 10:36 pm</p><hr />

Okay, I'm thinking of making a music editor program like this. Except it would not use the target system, it would use a zapper system, so you can easily edit things with the mouse. This is just an idea, mind you. But this is not meant to be played on a real NES, as is my level editor. I'd feel pretty stupid sitting there shooting the screen with the zapper gun on a music editor. And It'd just cause more complications putting it on the NES. But do any of you think an editor, not just a music editor, using the zapper system could result in a good developing environment?<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=138">Celius</a> — Thu Jan 26, 2006 8:28 pm</p><hr />

I meant that you could allow larger maps and test them with scrolling, and also make a homebuilt tile editor (trough it would be hard to edit tiles with the controller, you rather would do it with a real tile editor and paste it in your ROM).

You mean like have a 30x32 editor? Well, It'd be real annoying to code, though. I was feeling lazy last night, and I realized I could get the pattern table selection to be in 1 PPU section $2000-$20FF. if it were lower down, It'd be SO much harder to code. Well, it is pretty good I think. Like NSA, the meta tile version! I'm thinking of making more than just map editors like this. Like other types of editors, like item editors, enemy editors, things like that. I did make that editor in a day, so you have to at least give me credit for that. But I don't know if these other editors will be able to be whipped up like that in a day...<br /><br />EDIT: What do you mean by custom tiles? Like tiles of your own? Or custom tile IDs? The editor is built around a format that allows you to put a byte down like this:<br /><br />$80<br /><br />And it would show on the screen:<br /><br />$80,$81<br />$90,$91<br /><br />And the pattern table just shows these tile IDs:<br /><br />$00,$02,$04...$0E<br />$20,$22,$24...$2E<br />$40,$42,$44...etc.<br /><br />Because those are the corners of each 2x2 meta tile. Do ya get it? There's a weird bug in this editor though. It allows you to press a over a tile on the pattern table, and it will show up where you just were on the editor. But, when you do it over tile 0, it the screen just shakes, and nothing happens. But you can still just press select and go put tile 0 down like a normal tile, just when you try pressing a over on the pattern table while the cursor is over tile 0, it doesn't work!<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=138">Celius</a> — Sun Jan 22, 2006 1:14 pm</p><hr />
