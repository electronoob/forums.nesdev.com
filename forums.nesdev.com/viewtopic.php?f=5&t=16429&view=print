		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Well, I was going through my garage to make room for another car now that I've had my driver's license, and found our old Dell Desktop computer. Apparently, it was a good bit older than I thought, because its the Dell Dimension e510 from 2005. The hard drive is broken, but I took it out and was surprised to find out that my 2017 120GB SSD I got for free (when I was the aide for the IT guy at my school, he got hard drive on accident through a mail error, and he never had anyone ask for it back, so he gave it to me <img src="./images/smilies/icon_lol.gif" alt=":lol:" title="Laughing" /> ) actually had the same pinout and could then be plugged in, although I have no clue if it will actually work. The RAM in the computer was only 2, 256MB sticks, and I couldn't find the speed, but I looked up what the fastest RAM I could use for this motherboard is, and it's 533MHz DDR2 ram. Looking on eBay, I found a deal for 4, 2GB sticks (more than enough for something like this) for $16, (<!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.ebay.com/itm/like/321873758669?chn=ps&amp;dispItem=1">http://www.ebay.com/itm/like/3218737586 ... dispItem=1</a><!-- m -->) although it looks pretty sketchy (lack of brand, Chinese seller). The processor is a shitty Pentium 4 processor, and although this motherboard won't work with an Intel Core 2 processor despite having the same pinout (?) I found it should work with a Pentium D, which I think should at least be decent, as all programs are optimized for two cores now. Even if the best Pentium D (945) is still underpowered, I was still shocked that you can get one for less than $4! <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.ebay.com/itm/like/151857434668?chn=ps&amp;dispItem=1">http://www.ebay.com/itm/like/1518574346 ... dispItem=1</a><!-- m --> I was just looking up parts out of curiosity at first, but damn, I might be able to make a decent machine and sell it and make a few more bucks than I would otherwise. It should then be good for most people, unlike before, mainly due to the originally small RAM. It's not going to have any trouble browsing the internet or making a Word document.<br /><br />Really though, $4? Getting 100 of them would stomp a $400 modern day processor, if you could connect them all, anyway. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_lol.gif" alt=":lol:" title="Laughing" />

But bang for buck it should easily handle it, unless you go insane. Adobe stuff needs SSD and RAM more than CPU I've found, so if you tank up on RAM which the Server motherboards will let you go to town on, and give it a SSD should be good.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Thanks for the assessment! <br /><br />Heh, i pulled the trigger - hopefully the time i (hope to) save will equal out the electric bill of reintroducing a station to the household  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_lol.gif" alt=":lol:" title="Laughing" />  But the parts were dirt cheap. I'll post the list as a practical example of the OP title:<br /><br />2 xeon 5460 = 36 usd. <br />dual J-socket, server-like workstation MB from HP woth lots of ram and pci slots; fans and sinks included = 73 usd. <br />A full set of 32gb (8x4gb) RAM = 14 usd. <br /><br />The second cpu isn't going to help me much, like you said, but it was almost literally 2 for the price of 1. <br />AfterEffects can allocate cores and RAM per core (so other processes won't choke from AE being too greedy, i presume). <br />The MB was a crossroads. I gained super cheap and plentiful RAM at the cost of needing to use ddr2 instead of ddr3 which some 775 boards support. Most 775 MB:s seems rigged for 4, 8 or 16gb ram. 16 would have been ok for my needs. Anyway i'm glad for some of the 'server' features on the 771 MB without it getting hairy with odd pcb dimensions and slot placements. DDR2 at 667mhz is slow compared to todays' standards, but i get 32gb of them for lunch money.<br /><br />Shipping set me back ~60 usd in total. The price for not being patient and lurk for options on more local market sites. <br /><br />I think i have or should be able to scrounge the rest for free - except just maybe the one expensive option being a PCI-E SSD drive which could probably help significantly (concidering the various bottleneck speeds of early SATA:s). Either way a whole lot cheaper than my current laptop, and should be more powerful in every regard except ram speed. + i can always keep the laptop for side tasks when not traveling with it. <br /><br />I wonder if it'd be possible (assuming the mb allows it in the first place) to voltage starve the RAM just by some without negative effects to lower the power consumption.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />btw, i should probably add that most 775/771 mobo:s will likely have a mix of pcie v1.x, pci-x and maybe even pci slots.<br />Some few seem to have pcie v.2, but i haven't found one with the right chipset that fits the low-budget concept.<br /><br />If my assessment is correct, pcie ssd:s may be capped by some and then i'm not sure of what the real-world numbers would be. <br /><br />PCI-e v.1.x can at a theoretical best transfer 125MB/s per direction and lane (total bandwidth 250MB/s per lane).<br /><br />Most PCI-e SSD:s are 4-lane or 8-lane. I'm wondering to what extent they make use of them. But let's say they do - you'd get a theoretical total bandwidth of 1GB/s or 2GB/s per direction, or half when just looking at either read/write direction. <br /><br />SATA II at 3Gbit/s is the most common on these 771/775 boards. It has a 285 MB/s read and 275 MB/s write spead; best case. <br />So a PCI-e SSD would be ~2x or ~4x faster, max, depending on lanes, because of the v1.x bottleneck.   <br /> <br />SATA III at 6Gbit/s doesn't seem common; i don't recall finding one. If there is, the advantage would be even less. <br /><br /><br />Note that not all mechanical x16 / x8 pci-e slots are x16 / x8 electrically. They may be 8x or 4x. <br /><br />The (probably naïve) best case scenario of a pci-e-ssd bandwidth of 1 or 2 GB/s then competes with a SATA III adapter.<br />A 4-lane one is pretty even with SATA iii. An 8-lane would be about just nearly twice as fast. <br /><br /><br /><strong>Conclusion:</strong><br />As far as pcie v1 goes,<br />-One can most likely get an adapter + a SATA SSD for a lot cheaper than a pci-e ssd when looking at larger volumes.  <br />-The benefit vs cost seems largest and somewhat worth considering for a small-volume, 8-lane pci-e-ssd, provided the 775/771 board has an electrical 8-lane slot available. One could use it for large, non-archived projects to speed up the work flow. Else, a sata III adapter would probably be better (the point is having a low-cost system, after all).<br /><br />Pcie v2 would've been a different deal alltogether. <br /><br /><br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">SATA-NIC</div><br /> <img src="./images/smilies/icon_lol.gif" alt=":lol:" title="Laughing" />

I was going to put 8GB of RAM in because DDR2 RAM is super cheap, but apparently, the motherboard won't recognize more than 3.25GB (?) for God knows what reason. I realize I'm working with a computer from 2005 that wasn't particularly high end when it came out, but why can't I use an Intel Core Duo, which uses the same socket as the Pentium D?

Do you mean an intel core duo that specifically has an lga 775 socket, or that core 2 duos have a 775 sockets in general? because some use socket M rather than T.<br /><br />Another reason i went with a 771 board was because apparently, ECC (&quot;server only&quot;) ddr2 ram costs nothing at the moment (beside it being 32gb RAM ready).<br /><br />And yeah a pcie to sata 3 adapter seems the most reasonable way to go for boards of this age. Just make sure there's a vacant slot that has enough lanes to cover the desired bandwidth. A slot that looks like an 8-lane but really is a 1-lane won't do much good here.<br /><br />There's also pci-x to pcie 4-lane converters, but finding one cheap can be a challenge. Easier to get a board with the right expansion ports cheap.
