<br />It's clear that most people buy PowerPaks for playing pirate games, but this is a development forum and it's not OK to ask for pirated stuff here. I'm sure you can find other ways of obtaining the ROM.

<br />
<br />Im just curious here, but how much extra would it have actually cost to use the XC2S50? and could that chip emulate all SNES enhancement chips? If so, is there any possibility that there could be an 'enhanced' SNES PowerPak at some point in the foreseeable future?
<br />
<br />It just seems like such a good idea to have a cart that could support all enhancement chips (Like the NES PowerPak does with different mappers) Even if it would add some extra to the cost.

The only hope would be to multiplex the SDRAM between the SNES and enhancement chip and I don't know if that's even a possibility with the hardware implementation much less at the necessary speed. Even with the 100, this would still be the case. Could it be done however, the SA-1 would have a slight chance at being implemented/fitting.

<br />
<br />PowerPak says "I want 1 sector starting from #x".  Card says "ok its ready".  PowerPak reads 1 sector (512 bytes).  Then it checks how many sectors the card thinks are left to be read.  The correct answer is 0, but many SanDisk cards say 1.  Likely a timing problem where they are too slow and miss some read signals so they still think there are some bytes left to be read.  I don't know if its the authentic or fake SanDisk cards that act this way because not all of them do.

<br />Odd.  The 2GB Dane-Elec I <em>bought </em>with the Powerpak doesn't work at all, yet the Sandisk Ultra II 8GB I had here works fine.

Games under 512KB will also not be loaded right.  It can all be fixed in the mapper software, just low priority right now.

<br />Yeah, same problem for me with Contra 3.
<br />Also, Family Feud and Jeopardy both need a reset after game load to work properly as well.
