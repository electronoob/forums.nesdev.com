		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />So first of all it's just a long time I've come here.<br />I should mention, I've seen in the past and recently news stuff here, and was amazed by the work you guys have done. After all, I've never realized what I wanted (simply doing a demo), because my times were short, and I probably don't have the skill.<br /><br />So anyway, long times ago, after hacking some SMB3 custom levels, I've decided to try doing a platformer game. The results are lots of levels graphics and some characters.<br />I've also thinking about news concepts, what the nes should be if we would have keeped his spirit.<br />So here are stuff I've made for the nes, and stuffs I've expand to a &quot;nes style&quot; more evolved game.<br />Keep in mind it's just for sharing with you, and get criticisms and advices.<br />For the moment those are just concepts, and I would probably don't manage to turn it into a game.<br /><br />So, the main goal is to evolved a game but with keeping the mains feeling of a nes game.<br />I'm probably not the first who have thinking about that, but after all, I've successfully implement the process for graphics creations. First idea is to keep pixels organizations for sprites and graphics. All graphics should be done as a nes game at first, so here is an example of a little wood level : <a href="http://imageshack.com/a/img633/8339/zfdNkM.png" class="postlink">http://imageshack.com/a/img633/8339/zfdNkM.png</a><br /><img src="http://imageshack.com/a/img633/8339/zfdNkM.png" alt="Image" /><br /><br /><br />After that, those graphics could be improved and computed using a vectorial software like inkscape.<br />Pixel proportions must be keeped, and tilesets or sprites should be remade in grey scales images (for using 3 colors palette like the nes). It require a lot of skills in vectorial creation to be convincing.<br />The result are some png table graphics which could be scaled for high medium or low resolutions screens. It also give the life to anti-aliasing which doesn't exist at 255 levels on nes games.<br />So this same level (with a few things added) is multi-resolution capable (click the link to see HD) : <a href="http://imageshack.com/a/img908/6672/EfWXm5.png" class="postlink">http://imageshack.com/a/img908/6672/EfWXm5.png</a><br /><img src="http://imagizer.imageshack.us/v2/640x480q90/908/EfWXm5.png" alt="Image" /><br /><br />Others I've made based on the same tileset process :<br /><br /><a href="http://imageshack.com/a/img911/4744/FIsuj5.png" class="postlink">http://imageshack.com/a/img911/4744/FIsuj5.png</a><br /><img src="http://imagizer.imageshack.us/v2/640x480q90/911/FIsuj5.png" alt="Image" /><br /><br /><a href="http://imageshack.com/a/img905/4249/yAivvn.png" class="postlink">http://imageshack.com/a/img905/4249/yAivvn.png</a><br /><img src="http://imagizer.imageshack.us/v2/640x480q90/905/yAivvn.png" alt="Image" /><br /><br /><a href="http://imageshack.com/a/img908/2867/oopaE9.png" class="postlink">http://imageshack.com/a/img908/2867/oopaE9.png</a><br /><img src="http://imagizer.imageshack.us/v2/640x480q90/908/oopaE9.png" alt="Image" /><br /><br />I've also done the same process on some sprites, here is a cute squirrel walk cycle :<br /><img src="http://imageshack.com/a/img903/8632/wmF7sR.png" alt="Image" /><br /><br />First frame example done in vectorial inkscape software (a grid is used to represent pixels and tiles) :<br /><a href="http://imageshack.com/a/img903/3405/pJJw0T.png" class="postlink">http://imageshack.com/a/img903/3405/pJJw0T.png</a><br /><img src="http://imagizer.imageshack.us/v2/640x480q90/903/pJJw0T.png" alt="Image" /><br /><br />Other nes graphics I've done:<br /><br /><br /><a href="http://imageshack.com/a/img905/73/hqM76l.png" class="postlink">http://imageshack.com/a/img905/73/hqM76l.png</a><br /><img src="http://imagizer.imageshack.us/v2/640x480q90/905/hqM76l.png" alt="Image" /><br /><br /><a href="http://imageshack.com/a/img911/3880/fLiQxt.png" class="postlink">http://imageshack.com/a/img911/3880/fLiQxt.png</a><br /><img src="http://imagizer.imageshack.us/v2/640x480q90/911/fLiQxt.png" alt="Image" /><br /><br />And after all, some news stuffs character done recently based on mario (not vectorized at the moment) :<br /><img src="http://imageshack.com/a/img905/8793/sveqDk.png" alt="Image" /><br /><img src="http://imageshack.com/a/img907/3825/OCONZ2.png" alt="Image" /><br /><br />I will love to here what you think about the idea.<br />If you want to see, I've also others nes stuff, I've never show.

(See <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dkjbM6xEjaA" class="postlink">The Adventures of Batman and Christopher Robin</a>.)<br /><br />But good pixel art so far. Have you planned out how these three characters will feel? Will it be like Sonic, Tails, and Knuckles, where you choose one character to play through the whole game and the hard parts in various levels are in different places for different characters? Or will it be like The Lost Vikings, where you have to use teamwork involving each character's abilities to pass each level?
