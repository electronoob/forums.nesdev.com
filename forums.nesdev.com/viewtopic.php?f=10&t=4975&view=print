		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Ok, so I'm not really a newbie but i feel that this is the best place for this question anyways.
<br />
<br />Currently, what would be the least hassle-free and most affordable way to make a small run (around 150) of cartridges? We're going to sell carts so total price per cart can't be too steep but we're fully aware of everything involved so we're not expecting to sell 'em for peanuts.
<br />
<br />I'm currently developing the application and it's essentially just a nes-album.

<br />Most work, least expensive - use donor carts, will have to desolder chips, do some simple rewiring of the boards, clean off old labels, etc

<br />
<br />the least hassle free way would be to talk to retrousb or similar and see how much they would charge to do a run.  you could possibly save money by doing some of the assembly yourself even if you farm out most of the work

<br />btw, how do newly produced carts (ie no donor parts) defeat NES10?

<br />Using a microcontroller with functionally identical code.

<br />It ended up being the Tengen clone of the chip that revealed the code.  kevtris developed a PIC version (with region detection).  I'll be using that on my future boards, or may develop my own.

<br />Unless your mapper isn't available on a RetroZone CPLD yet. Last time I checked, I could only see a "discrete board" to replace NROM, CNROM, BNROM, AOROM, and UNROM, and an "MMC1 compatible board" to replace S*ROM, not anything with a scanline counter or 8 KiB banks. A scanline counter isn't critical for a D-Pad Hero caliber music game, but 8 KiB banks might be handy so that you have separate banks for DPCM samples and any other data that needs to be streamed from the cart.

<br />Hahaha. Yeah, because there is a real shortage of NES games. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />
<br />
<br />Really, most NES games have probably already been destroyed, reusing some for you own stuff is hardly blasphemy. Most NES games aren't very good anyway.

<br />I'd agree with you if we were talking 3, 4, maybe 5 carts, but he wants to make 150! Surely there are many bad games that <strong>deserve</strong> to be destroyed, but even they will eventually end if everyone that creates a new game needs 150 boards and cases.
<br />
<br />I actually have nothing against destroying carts, even the ones I like, because someone else will probably think they suck. <strong>I</strong> won't destroy them, but I'll not freak out if someone else does. Most games have already been preserved in ROM form anyway, so it's not like we're actually loosing something. The thing is that Nintendo-made carts will end if everyone makes use of them, so it's more than healthy to find a renewable source.

<br />
<br />The number of carts produced today is nowhere near comparable to the numbers made back in the day. So if we reuse  1/1000 (or whatever the numbers might be) of the old carts for our new cool stuff it's really no big deal.
<br />
<br />EDIT: According to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Mario_Bros.#Reception_and_legacy" class="postlink">wikipedia</a>, Super Mario Bros alone sold 40 million copies. You'd have to be a pretty big dreamer to believe that the nes homebrew scene could even make a dent in the number of avaliable nes carts by reusing some.
