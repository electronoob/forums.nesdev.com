		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />OK, well, I bought a copy of Blaster Master from my local used game store and the outside looked IMMACULATE and the pins looked decent.  Well, I cleaned it with alcohol on a q-tip like every game before I try it and put it in the system and...nothing.  Tried cleaning more...nothing.  Well, today I brought it back since they have a 3.8mm security bit (just ordered mine <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /> ).
<br />
<br />It turns out the inside must have gotten wet at some point because the resistors were very corroded and there seemed to be a couple brown spots on the long skinny sections of the pins that lead back to the main chips as well as a very brown/rusty looking side of a resistor.
<br />
<br />We cleaned it as best we could and they said they would give me a refund if I tried it again and it didn't work (they didn't have an NES to test it there) or even let me exchange cases if I bought one online and it wasn't as good, but does anyone think it would be possible to bring it back from the dead?  
<br />
<br />
<br />The inside looks identical to this scan of "Solar Jetman" 
<br /><img src="http://multimedia.cx/nesgallery/aorom.jpg" alt="Image" />
<br />
<br />The most damaged/corroded/rusted resistor is the one in the lower left of the picture with the lower side (with respect to the picture) in the worst shape.
<br />
<br />So I was wondering if water can damage/fry the actual main chips or do you think the resistor acted like a fuse and burnt out?  I'm interested both as someone interested in preservation of the NES as well as a Mechanical Engineering student interested in a real world scenario.  I can take a picture of the ROM board whenever I get my copy of Blaster Master from Amazon.com in and go to bring this copy back if anyone is interested.  This is the first used NES game that I couldn't get to work with alcohol and a q-tip.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I've fixed a lot of water corroded stuff including a Sony videocam CCD board and a Blackberry with this technique: Take a really small screwdriver and clean all the corrosion between leads and around every connection even if it looks clean. Then clean again using alcohol. I doubt the resistors are fried but check them with a multimeter and replace them if they don't read the proper value. Check for shorts between adjacent leads and keep cleaning until they are cleared. The carts are pretty tough and it should be fixable.

<br />Both of those boards contains no resistor, only games with battery backup circuitery contain any. I guess you're refering to the coupling capacitors that looks a bit like resistors. If they are short-circuited, the whole power would be so, and the Led wouldn't even light on. If they are left floating, more parasite will come on the power line. Try replace the capacitors by any other 22nF to 100nF capacitors, that's worth a try.

<br />
<br />I posted it just so I could show you the "resistor" (capacitor apparently) that was in bad shape to see if perhaps it fell in the circuitry in a way that it would be the cause of the problem.  
<br />
<br />Also, I didn't mean the capacitor was causing the short circuit, but rather by putting the wet rom board in an NES and powering it on it created a short circuit that fried the board.  I don't know if this happened, but its a possibility (unless the case below is true).
<br />
<br />One thing neither of you mentioned though, are the black chips (mappers?) immune to permanent water damage? there's no doubt I could replace the capacitors, but would the chips still be fried?  I really think someone got the circuit wet (probably tried to clean with soap and water or something stupid like that) and put it in the system, so do you think it could be permanently fried or is the voltage/amps low enough that that wouldn't be the case?  I'm not going to mess with it myself because I already asked and they'll give me a refund, but if the black chips (whatever they are called) are pretty invincible I'll pass that info along so they can give it a try.  It is a computer repair shop after all, so they should have no problem soldering on a new capacitor.

Someone on another forum insisted repros and original cartridges are good for about 20 years and some change, but aren't real NES games programmed different from repros?  From what I understand, the real NES games are permanently set and aren't susceptible to bit rot because its not an erasable medium.  Is that right?

<br />that's not my solar jetman picture, that was just a scan I found to demonstrate, the Blaster Master chip looks much, much worse.
<br />
<br />As for the longevity question, again, are the REAL NES cartridges (not repros) permanently set?  In other words, are the bits set like a lightswitch versus, say, a hand holding a switch up as is the case with normal flash drives and such?  Because, frankly, I will be really mad if all these games I am collecting just stop working for basically no reason in a few years.

<br />More like a lightbulb that is soldered into or left out of the circuit.
<br />
<br />But then there's a difference between <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flash_memory#Low-level_access" class="postlink">NAND and NOR flash</a>. CF, SD, and USB memory cards use NAND flash, which normally incorporates a fair amount of error correction coding. This is practical because the NAND flash is always read a sector at a time, rather than a byte at a time as in NOR flash.

<br />Are you sure? you are aware I'm talking about the things that look like this right?: <img src="http://www.dragonmodz.net/images/resistor.gif" alt="Image" />
<br />
<br />Because that's a resistor, I searched the web and I never found anything that looked like that and was called a capacitor of any kind.  If you have evidence that dictates differently, please provide it because if I'm right, I don't want people going out and throwing capacitors where a resistor should be.

<br />
<br />OK, just wanted to be sure, because I happened to be at radio shack buying an electic motor, potentiometer, etc. for an engineering class and I was looking through at the capacitors and I didn't see anything that looked like that.  It seems like a bad idea to make them look so similar though, b/c I would've have thought twice about buying resistors and soldering them on (although I guess the bands would give it away).
