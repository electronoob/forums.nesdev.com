<br />You can always rip graphics from other sources or draw really primative/place holder type things. Alternatively you may have artistic friends you can ask for help.

<br />
<br />I'm talking about moving a sprite, writing a hello world demo, experimenting with the sound regs. I'm sorry, it takes almost no talent to at least scribble something in a tile for a sprite demo, and like MottZilla said, you can rip a font from a commercial game. I'm pretty sure that's what I did, even knowing next to nothing about NESDev.
<br />
<br />And besides, is drawing CHR really <em>that</em> hard so you have to resort to hacking commercial games? I could understand if you ripped the graphics from one because you're lazy, but seriously, it's not hard to quick draw something.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />The 6502 is indeed a very simple processor, and I feel that the online information is more than enough to cover all aspects of it. In fact, I was able to gather much more (accurate) information from the web than from the couple of 6502 books I could get my hands on.
<br />
<br />Sometimes people seem to think books are magical things that can teach you anything. Personally, I think the internet is way more powerful than any book, probably because it's searchable, while it's easy to get lost in huge books. I've learned thousands of things from articles and tutorials on the web, but very little from paper books.
<br />
<br />Anyway, I too think it's a bit annoying how Hamtaro126 comes here every other week asking questions that are completely unrelated to the previous one, expecting some sort of magical simple answer that will fix all his problems.
<br />
<br />Now, I can understand jumping from one project to another like you change your underwear (I used to be like that too, but I'm glad to say I'm a lot more focused nowadays), but one has to pick projects that are doable. Picking a project you have no idea how to accomplish is not going to take you anywhere, as you are not going to magically learn everything in the process.
<br />
<br />My advice to Hamtaro126 is to start with simpler projects that requires knowledge you already have. Don't be so ambitious, and increase the complexity a bit from project to project. That way you'll have a chance of actually learning something (as well as practicing something you already know), instead of being lost all the time and never getting remotely close to finishing anything.
<br />
<br />If you actually want to learn 6502 ASM and PPU/APU coding (not because someone told you to), there's nothing stopping you. Many people on this board came here with zero knowledge of these things (me included), and are now very decent NES coders. You just gotta start from the bottom, like everyone else. There are no shortcuts. As Celius said, the first few steps are the boring/simple sprite/controller/sound demos. Those are not exactly projects (in fact, people would want to hurt the ones releasing that kind of crappy tests, so it's just better to keep them private), but are necessary in order for one to understand how to talk to the system.

<br />
<br />It depends on your background too. Do you have any computer science background? If not, some tutorial may be more difficult because you may be confused by the basics like variables, loops, stack etc.  
<br />
<br />What kind of other language you know?  If you don't know any other, it could be a good thing (but not required) to learn the basic in less cryptic one like C or even basic would be fine.
<br />
<br />Basics are important to be able to understand how to program. Without the basics, you will get lost.  I think this comment is quite general for anything you learn.

<br />
<br />I currently know ZZT and some MZX, But they are ''Unrelated, Fake languages'', and I know how to use a computer and everything, But I am not a Programmer yet.
<br />
<br />For one thing, But I am a In-between (Beginner and/or Novice) ROM hacker. For Another, I know how to ROM hack a tiny bit of ASM. and mostly use a disassembly of any sorts if there is one
<br />
<br />But BASIC or above is a problem to learn, Especially with the stuff that makes it harder than the original interpeter/compiler. 
<br />
<br />My Last Words before going to sleep:
<br />I wish there was a ''(Clickteam's) Games factory'' for creating Rom Hacking Utilities like level editors.
