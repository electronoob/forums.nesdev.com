		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Just to make the difference clear in case anyone's not familiar with the terminology:<br /><br />DPCM: 1-bit differential PCM, where each bit modifies the waveform relatively from the previous value, increasing or decreasing it. These can be automatically read and played by the APU while the CPU runs code normally.<br /><br />PCM: The software writes 7-bit samples directly to the APU, so it has full control over the source format of the audio data and the playback rate. The fact that the software is busy preparing the data and outputting it at a steady rate often means it can't do anything else, so there's usually no action when these samples are played.

There are animated graphics on the title screen, but they very blatantly pause every time the game plays a sample:<br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PriTocGzp3o">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PriTocGzp3o</a><!-- m --><br /><br />At the other end of the spectrum, Gauntlet 2 does manage to pull off PCM without interrupting gameplay. And there's PCM galore!:<br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ISyFQpZkSS0">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ISyFQpZkSS0</a><!-- m --><br /><br />I think the low samplerate (approximately 5.2 kHz) is what allows the game to juggle its resources. It seems to be the most effort any NES game put into having lots of PCM with gameplay. And now that I think about, I believe Gauntlet 2, Skate or Die 2, <s>and Battletoads</s> might be the only games that have some PCM where not everything else pauses?
