But that's not a place that you can physically get to without comparatively nice equipment.<br /><br />If you're planning on decapping the DMG to get eensy logic probes in, it would make more sense to go all the way to something like Visual2A03.<br /><br /><br />Cypress's EZ-USB is a product line. It's a <a href="https://sigrok.org/wiki/Lcsoft_Mini_Board" class="postlink">$12 IC</a> that you can buy from various places on a board.

It's integrated on the CPU die, and the &quot;DAC&quot; most likely consists of a bunch of resistors (something like an R2R ladder) driven by digital lines from each channel. Then  the channels (as far as I understand from their behavior) are mixed analog, and finally attenuated anlog by the master volume register, all on the same die. Your only interface to the sound circuit is the two analog outputs, unless you decap the chip and probe the die with needles or something.<br /><br />This sounds like an X/Y problem. What is the actual thing you are looking to achieve? Lossless audio and videorecording? Fast communication with the program running on the CPU?

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Early DMGs used philips head screw instead of triwings for the exterior screws. If you look through the hole in the case for the battery lid latch, you'll see the motherboard revision. DMG-CPU-04 and lower will always use philips head screws, and some DMG-CPU-05 units will as well. DMG-CPU-05 and later will usually use triwings, though. The case screws are the same diameter as the internal ones, so the head should be identical as well, if they are philips.
