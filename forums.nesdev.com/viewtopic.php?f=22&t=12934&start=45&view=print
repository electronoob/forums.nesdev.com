		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />(Not sure why I was expecting bombs to be BG objects.)<br /><br />The &quot;fast&quot; way I wanted to test, jumping and placing a bomb <em>3</em> squares (48px at top…further testing reveals you can get it up to around 56px up with a standing jump and still land on it) up from where you stand, on the way up, so you land on it, is… easier than I expected. You don't even have to move forward, as the bomb already horizontally intersects you when placed. Likewise, it would remain unaffected even if the 32-pixel explosion radius causes bombs to explode.<br /><br />But it's a decent bit harder than just building-a-staircase-of-bombs like you were doing.<br /><br />[hr]<br />Testing notes:<br /><ul><li>Not sure I like the auto-popover-one-block-stairs. Kind of want it to not work if pressing down, at least. (I notice that this also works like the Power Grip, catching you on some ledges you'd miss by  about a tile.)<br /><ul><li>But then it just doesn't work in the cave in level…? not sure what level it is. 5? 6?</li><li>Something I'm very thankful for is that it doesn't happen walking up against spikes, nor does running into a spike from the side damage Nova.</li><li>Hmm, it's a function of the left/right boundary ground tiles, isn't it? It doesn't work on gray block tiles either. Or gray ground tiles (late level 7), or the rock. Very much don't like it when it's very arcane about when it'll activate.</li></ul></li><li>Still absolutely love the idea of a glider gun as a weapon.</li><li>The screen-blank on ability-copy or ability-ditch is rather irksome.<br /><ul><li>So's the one on &quot;rearrange inventory&quot;.</li></ul></li><li>Pressing against a wall of breakable bricks and jumping breaks all but the bottom one.</li></ul><div class="quotetitle">rainwarrior wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">I can break bricks simply by pushing horizontally against them and jumping. Is this intentional? If I can do this it feels like I should be able to just punch bricks straight-on, but I can't.</div><br />Yeah. You can, in fact, break bricks straight on…but only with the &quot;nothing&quot; power's shot. (I was expecting it to be the tailslap too.)<br /><ul><li>Nova (unlike Mario and Mega Man, but like Simon Belmont) suffers from the traditional &quot;Cannot use arms and legs at the same time&quot; syndrome (that is, cannot walk/run and attack). It is particularly nasty as you have to stop or jump to attack, otherwise it <em>only</em> engages the run speed, often the opposite of what you want right in front of an enemy. (Moreover, it's inconsistent: falling off a ledge, one cannot attack.) Speaking of falling off of ledges, you can't pass down through a ledge if you're holding left or right. (Like SMB3 I suppose, as mentioned?)</li><li>Level 2 repeats level 1's (very long) cutscene of announcement of new policy.

Was unable to replicate.</li><li>Cannot affect the hamburger cannons. Their shot pattern is a bit random, too- I've seen a volley of <em>four</em> (its bobbing somehow managed to avoid capping sprite limit anywhere). There's not even an invulnerable &quot;tink&quot;.</li><li>Stunned hamburgers pass through you, as expected, but this means obtaining a hamburger shot (for all its Long Beam, no-copy power) is difficult <em>and</em> luck-based, as you basically have to shoot before the cannon does, and then manage to get a copyshot off before it reaches you. (alternately, shooting a copy-shot such that the burger runs into your tail to get stunned seems to work??)</li><li>Found a pixel (see attachment) where I could not pass down through a white platform. Replicated a few times. Works in level 1, too. Seems to be on boundary between &quot;end&quot; and &quot;middle&quot; tiles of white-platform. (Left *and* right ends, from what I see.)<br /><ul><li>edit: easy way to replicate in level 1 is to drop left of the springboard, then inch forward until you just barely touch the spring, sending you through the white platform: you won't be able to go back down without moving left or right.</li></ul></li><li>Ladder-climbing into a &quot;goomba&quot;-like from below kills it, damages you, and bounces you out its top like you jumped on it.</li><li>It's not obvious for a lot of moving platforms where they turn around. This is particularly nasty with one that stops one tile short of where you could walk on (see attachment), when all the previous ones went right up to the ledge.<br /><ul><li>Moving platforms, if you stand near the edge of a ledge they <em>do</em> reach at the end of their motion, will automatically take you from it. This is true even if it goes down from that ledge, and it'll &quot;suck&quot; you off of the edge. Not sure if bug or feature…? It makes it easy to get on platforms if you know about it.</li></ul></li><li>Swimming to the top of a water under a ceiling results in continuous &quot;I hit an unbreakable ceiling!&quot; noise, even with no directions pressed.</li><li>Unpausing from inventory (with A) sometimes leaves a garbage line on screen momentarily. <s>Haven&#39;t checked if this happens on hardware yet.</s> Couldn't get it to on PowerPak, though it does seem like you're re-enabling rendering before setting the scroll.</li><li>Pizza does nothing? (even when damaged)</li><li>Dying on 1-1 refills your inventory with all the toys. Dying on 1-2 (or later) does not.<br /><ul><li>For that matter, noting which checkpoint of a level you're in on the death/load screen might be nice.</li><li>I'm not particularly enamored of the &quot;plz&quot; there either, but that's just me being old, perhaps…</li></ul></li><li>Only Nova can stand on bombs.

Enemies fall through moving platforms too, and I think most NES and SNES games I've played don't bother to make sprites interact with sprite-based platforms. Forcing them into a grid and putting them in the background seems to work for Pocket Bomberman though.

The problem with that sort of checkpoint is that you practically have to include a &quot;start level over with initial items&quot; button, or you can get yourself into trouble and waste. Are you sure it saves &quot;current power&quot;? It doesn't appear to restore such (go to end of 1-1, use bomb, go through door, dive into pit, bomb is gone from both powerslot and inventory).<br /><br />If I use the bomb during 1-2, it comes back into the inventory, though. So yeah, hmm…just a little unclear.

Chip's Challenge certainly doesn't try to create any specific setting, instead just being this abstract world that focuses more on making the puzzle elements easy to recognize.<br /><br />RollerCoaster Tycoon has an <a href="http://i.imgur.com/BqejUyr.png" class="postlink">abstract theme</a> that focuses on geometric shapes and glass. Inspired, I tried to make a glassy, neon world even though glass is kinda hard to do without translucency. I kinda like what I ended up making, and it doesn't use up a whole lot of tiles.<br /><br />Might change the dithering style, since there's the diagonal striping thing on a TV but it doesn't bother me that much.

I really need to figure out how to make better quality videos, maybe not using FCEUX for it. I guess it could be spoilerish since it's puzzle solutions? They're not very hard puzzles though.<br /><br />I'm gonna really try and get a lot more done on this game. I don't want it to take 5 years to complete, and I want it to be done at the very least by the time the actual 53 game cart is made, so it can be on there.<br /><br />I've been working on adding a lot more puzzle-oriented stuff and new enemies. I have a lot of enemies drawn and ideas for them thought up that I haven't actually programmed in yet, and I have ideas for boss fights. The first boss fight is in, but it's really just a recreation of how a typical DABG level goes.<br /><br /><img src="http://i.imgur.com/qsNaHao.gif" alt="Image" /><br />Now there's actual enemies you can get the Glider ability from. Yeah, they're not to the same scale, but they at least move correctly.<br /><br />I have <a href="http://i.imgur.com/rphS1gV.gifv" class="postlink">pushable blocks</a> that can be pushed on top of other blocks, though I think I want to add more animation to them. Later I'll add ones you can pick up and put down, too.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I had the realization that I actually can make levels and worlds out of order, so I've been working on world 3 a bit.<br />I decided I didn't like <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/viewtopic.php?p=170410#p170410" class="postlink">the old palette</a> I was using for it after actually seeing it on my TV and deciding the background was way too bright. I'm starting to see why so many games used black so much; there's black, and then there's really vibrant colors and nothing really between.<br /><br />I went with a black background, but I changed it so that it used a pattern instead of being a boring solid black. Really wishing I had a second background here, though I think it looks okay:<br /><img src="http://i.imgur.com/2qXvE4v.png" alt="Image" /><br /><br />Compared to <a href="http://i.imgur.com/Uqtukqg.png" class="postlink">the old snow tiles</a> I also took out the dithering since it looked terrible on my real TV. I realize I'm using checkerboard dithering in a whole lot of other places but I'm not sure if I'm changing it there too.<br /><br />World 3 is going to include rideable minecarts, and minecarts are going to have sloped sections, and <a href="http://i.imgur.com/LDBDvAn.gifv" class="postlink">I evidently don't know how to code slopes</a> but I'll figure it out. It should be a lot easier since the environment is much more controlled, and I can make compromises like making sure a minecart never falls on top of a sloped section. One thing that makes them more complicated is that they're offset from the grid a bit.<br /><br />---<br /><br />I realized that for sprites that are ONLY going to appear in cutscenes and nowhere else, I can get another color for free because I can just use transparent anywhere the sprite uses white. I've recolored a few sprites to take advantage of this:<br /><img src="http://i.imgur.com/GvAB9XC.png" alt="Image" /><br /><br /><a href="http://i.imgur.com/E4E8b43.gif" class="postlink">A neat idea</a>: have multiple rooms that look pretty similar to each other, and give the impression that the doors are changing the room, rather than transporting you. My inspiration was Floria from Kirby Super Star but I think that's a trope that's been in all sorts of games.
