Here's the <a href="https://forums.nesdev.com/viewtopic.php?p=208088#p208088" class="postlink">relevant thread</a>.  Feel like there was somewhere requesting we add PRG-RAM to the cartridge for saves, but can't find it.  Hoping we can keep action53 hardware discussion in that thread keep things organized.

I just wanted to let the people working on it know that there are fans out there that love the Action 53 line, and are excited for the next version. I'll for sure buy it, whenever it comes.<br /><br />FWIW, I also bought Lizard, and have been enjoying it. I enjoy supporting the homebrew community where and when I can.
