<br />Obviously there are reasons for it, but it's still brain-damaged. It completely invalidates the possibility of switching banks for quick tasks, such as loading a few bytes, because the overhead is too damn high. The amount of bank switching you can do in a single frame is severely reduced with the MMC1, IMO.
<br />
<br />About making carts, you don't have to be limited to the discrete logic mappers (although I do think this is a good idea), since there are a few people making CPLD mappers you can buy.

An e-book reader or an RPG's dialogue might be like this. The naive implementation would require switching back and forth between the dictionary bank and the compressed text bank after each word, and this might actually work for something like UNROM. A less naive implementation would bankswitch to the text, copy the data verbatim to RAM, bankswitch to the dictionary, and decompress it against the dictionary.
<br />
<br />Think of the bankswitching time as like a TLB miss penalty and look up cache-friendly algorithms.

You can't waste RAM to handle data from the compressed bank as you'll need RAM for the uncompressed data, and you can probably not waste RAM for the dictionary/decompression code either for the same reason. I'd say the best way would be to have the decompression in the fixed bank at all costs and put something else that takes up place in the fixed bank elsewhere.
<br />
<br />I haven't worked really hard on compression on the NES yet but I plan to. Also I haven't ever worked really hard on PRG bankswitching either, as I personally never used that in my projects yet.

<br />I can tell you that sometimes it's really hard organizing the data in a way that minimizes the number of bank switches.
<br />
<br />For example, I'm using 32KB bankswitching, and I have the game engine in one bank, but the level data is scattered across other banks. So whenever I have to draw a row or column of blocks for scrolling, I have to call a subroutine in the bank where the level map is. Whenever a character has to check the map for collisions, same thing. Whenever an object is erased from the background and the original background has to be restored, more bankswitching.
<br />
<br />That doesn't add up to hundreds of bankswitches, but I expect to need around a couple dozen of them per frame... With an MMC1 that would mean over 2200 cycles wasted on bankswitching... That's nearly 8% of the total time for game logic, which is unacceptable. In a common discrete logic mapper that figure goes down to less than 2% of the total time.

<br />This buffer to hold compressed data can overlay the decompressed data or overlay OAM.
<br />
<br />I do an "interbank fetch" in my multicart project, whose mapper doesn't have a fixed bank. The menu puts a small piece of code in RAM that switches to a bank with compressed CHR data, copies some to a buffer elsewhere in RAM, and then switches back to the menu bank with the decompression code. The second switch has to scan the reset stub for a $FF byte so that it can get back home to the menu without a bus conflict, which is at least as expensive as the MMC1 write sequence. I call this subroutine once in ordinary frames; two switches per frame isn't too bad.
<br />
<br />Of course, you don't need to go to quite as much trouble if you aren't making a multicart because then you have a fixed bank.

<br />Because not all PCs come with Windows, and not all developers of Windows applications are interested in fixing bugs that pop up only in Wine or Mono. I imagine more people have HTML browsers than Windows PCs. But with that nitpick out of the way, I find your wizard idea interesting.

Really the only reason I have the "do you want to run on carts" and "do you want to run on PowerPak" questions is to weed out people who get Hello World running in Nesticle and then think they're NES programmers.
<br />
<br />I could change it to remember the "no carts, yes PowerPak" choice, but then I'd skip MMC5 screens because I lack faith that the PowerPak's MMC5 is perfect, and I'd make PRG RAM available with all of Nintendo's discrete mappers. I'd also have to make a choice: either make it in JavaScript (and have it fail for users who use NoScript) or make it in PHP (and have it fail when run offline). And at that point, I'd probably put a question distinguishing donor carts from virgin carts earlier in the sequence.
