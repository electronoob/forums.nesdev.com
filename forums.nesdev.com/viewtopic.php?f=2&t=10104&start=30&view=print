		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Question for anyone who understands Visual 2C02: Would writing to $2000 on one specific cycle (possibly only on one PPU/CPU clock alignment) while the bits in the PPU address are updated cause this? <br /><br />The last thing Super Mario Bros. does in its NMI routine is write to $2000 to turn the NMI back on. If you mark every write to $2000 by changing the tint bits, you can see that this tends to occur about halfway down the screen (approximately where the glitchy line would be). Zelda does something similar when scrolling horizontally.

Then perhaps one way to avoid it is not to write to $2000 except near a scroll split, and instead use some other way to work around NMI-in-NMI. If, as Drag claims, it is less common in later games, that could be three things: later games using SMB3-style horizontal mirroring with horizontal scrolling (and thus a bus conflict on bit 10 of <em>v</em> has no effect), later games doing less processing in the NMI handler as opposed to the SMB1-style &quot;super loop&quot;, or just ignoring nested NMIs in software. But if $2000 write conflicts are the cause, sprite 0 spin waits would be less affected.<br /><br />Statistics would be appreciated for what games turn NMI off and on mid-frame.

	</div><br /><br />EDIT: Seems that a write around pixel 255 is the cause. H/V scroll positions are irrelevant. Only occurs for two of the four CPU-PPU alignments (the two middle ones in the table I posted a while back, one of which is the &quot;preferred&quot; one). Hmmm, and only occurs reliably for preferred alignment (third in table).<br /><br />Also, only occurs when write is at one particular dot. Not more than one. Clear now why it occurs so rarely in SMB, since you can only even hit this dot on every third scanline.<br /><br />Maybe someone can probe this with Visual 2C02 now to see what's happening and exactly which dot it occurs on.

That's the usual way to handle vblank timing on most systems, really (though of course that didn't stop many programmers from doing it in other ways). Note that this means the interrupt itself would be most likely less than half a scanline long, it's just write a single value to RAM and then return =P Of course this would also happen in vblank so it would never be visible.

I almost clicked the &quot;quote&quot; button as soon as I read the first sentence in Sik's post. But Yeah, this does make a huge difference in NES games IMO. It's as simple as this: if you don't interrupt the game logic for crucial PPU/APU updates that are timed from VBlank, things will screw up if there's any lag. The flag method is perfectly fine if you're absolutely sure the game logic will never take longer than a frame to finish (i.e. the entire game has no lag).
