<br />I know it's off topic but Just out of curiosity, are you coding has a hobby only or your daily jobs include some kind of coding?

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />It's hard for me to figure that I've made money out of NES development.  While I've had profitable releases, I've always put it all back into my NESdev bookkeeping (which now even has it's own savings account, I throw maybe a quarter of my modest income into it - so much for retirement <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />).  I operated on a shoe-string budget, did a lot of miserly bargain-hunting, and for many years my nights were marathon sessions of NES experiments and diving into all kinds of technical subjects.  But I was broke.  Now I do the 40 hours a week thing, saving up that money, knowing I'll get it back after I put it into some crazy NES projects..
<br />
<br />So that's my story for why you should support the new, independent NES developers of the world.  Because we need money to operate with.  Especially me.   But I don't help myself by making all this priceless stuff and not having it ready for sale. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />

<br />--
<br />
<br />Slightly unrelated, and not to take away from Memblers's genuine words.
<br />
<br />As for new products that I'm awaiting:
<br />
<br />1.)  Expansion slot mod cart (or kit -- kinda ghetto) for expansion sound on the NES.
<br />
<br />2.)  Possibly a dongle cart for the NES with expansion audio chips in an FPGA...  Possibly controlled by an external dip slider?  This could make development and production cheaper and allow NES musicians (like myself) to have more accurate means to sound and music production.
<br />
<br />Edit:  Well, maybe not a dip slider, because there are those crazy-ass multichip NSFs.  I really wouldn't know how someone would be able to logic map the requests to init the different chips though.  Possible or not?
<br />
<br />Ideas or comments?

If the game is of decent quality I'd consider getting it.  The target audience is obviously going to be NES collectors and not your average consumer.
<br />
<br />This is partly educational for me too.  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_cool.gif" alt="8)" title="Cool" />  It's kinda nice to see myself writing programs that aren't dull school projects.  If only making things in C++ were so easy...

We know that Capcom will make Megaman 9 to look like a nes game, which is cool but it's not the real thing.  So what if a new real nes game would come out?<br /><br />It could be distributed in an emulated form trough wiiWare, Xbox arcade and Sony psn store for the people that don't have the hardware anymore BUT for the one that do, the game could be produced on a real cart.<br /><br />If the idea would take off, I could see many possibilities coming like producing hardware again, continuing some franchise that never had any sequels, providing a way for home brew game to be published  etc. Many possibilities indeed.  <br /><br />The interest in retro gaming and simpler games is becoming bigger and bigger so I think there could be a market for it.<br /><br />Since the nesdev community really enjoy the nes, I would like to have your thoughts on the subject.  It may only be a dream from someone that always wanted to produce software on the previous generation of console but who knows were a simple idea could go.</div>
<br />
<br />for the C-64 they came out with the "DTV"; and for Atari 2600 they came out with the "Atari Zero" (?)
<br />
<br />which were both self-contained systems in a joystick that plug directly into the tv.
