At this point I'm inclined to agree that the &quot;No new posts&quot; icon for third level forums isn't doing much good, and icon vs. no icon would do a better job of showing contrast.

If you're like me, and can't distinguish between the &quot;new posts&quot; and &quot;no new posts&quot; icons for the third-level forums (becuase the icon is 12x9 and only 1/3rd of that gets a very slight color shift for the new posts version), then add this to your Adblock rules list:<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">http://forums.nesdev.com/styles/subsilver2/imageset/icon_post_target.gif</div><br /><br />That'll hide the icon when there's not new posts.

From a newcomer's perspective, having a compo subcategory would be at least neat, especially if older compo threads were moved there. My reasoning is that browsing the newbie help category from time to time as an anonymous lurker in a couple of years is what helped me build up the confidence to finally take the plunge get into all the documents produced by the community, pdf scans of 80s homebrew books, and so on.<br /><br />I hope i can do an entry for the next compo. It may fail, but i'd sure like to try. Being able to conveniently have a scope of how the nes compo scene has evolved would certainly help, and be interesting, and may encourage more newcomers to join in and try to contribute.<br /><br />That being said, though, it wouldn't help if the category turned out as backwater. Could there be a middle road to mitigate this? What if compo subforum threads were mirrored to be listed in nesdev when browsing that?<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=7508">FrankenGraphics</a> — Fri Apr 29, 2016 5:28 am</p><hr />

It looks like there's enough interest to consider unfolding SNESdev and GBdev out from Other. Perhaps consider making a new category for &quot;other retro dev&quot; and have snes/gb/other on the main page again?

I suppose I'm responsible for this. I thought it would be nice to have the compo stuff together. I had no idea it would create a stink.<br /><br />I'm pretty excited to contribute to the compo and I'm just in favor of anything that increases accessibility of that. In theory, it would be neat, I think, if you could look at the previous compo posts, and browse them as a group. See what sort of talk was going on about Lawn Mower at the time. It's just a thought though and surely no big deal. It's easy to come up with pipe dreams especially when it's somebody else who would do the work.<br /><br />Since I started this thing I almost feel obligated to throw in my two cents, although it's not much beyond what I've said. I'm in favor of promoting Homebrew, Newbie Help, and NESdev higher, but that reflects my personal opinion of wanting to see game development. I usually use view active topics almost exclusively. I'll occasionally look at an individual board. When I do, it's usually to see if something appealing slipped past without me noticing or enough people replying to bump it up. To that effect, I'd find that better separation would be more useful. I'll want to keep up with the Compo stuff once rules get posted and things progress and I post my progress thread. Right now there's not much, but I could see there being a couple of pages of threads on the topic by the time deadline hits, and then there will still be plenty to talk about. Maybe I'm being optimistic, but I think a positive attitude is good when it comes to wanting to get people involved in a group activity.<br /><br />Really, I have no serious stake in the matter, and I wouldn't be hurt if nothing changed from how it was or is now. I just wanted to throw out the idea of a separate category for the compo with the rules stickied and things of that nature.<br /><br />Now, to the topic of actually doing real forum maintenance, I have long wondered if there is a link to donate to NESdev for the time spent in maintaining this community? I know it's a labor of love but it is for us too, and I for one wouldn't mind chipping in a little here and there. I'm not talking about big bucks but I've used the forum enough that I feel like I should. Maybe some people already do this. I for one would support a donate link. Prominent enough for regular users to find it but not in your face enough to be obnoxious.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=7129">darryl.revok</a> — Thu Apr 28, 2016 2:28 pm</p><hr />

A good rule of thumb...<br /></div><br />I didn't literally mean that I needed help choosing a category. My point was that it's annoying because it's relevant to multiple categories, and this is true for <em>a lot</em> of posts on this board. Forcing something into one category hides it from others.<br /><br />I guess my ideal board would filter posts by category tags instead of imposing exclusive organization on the posts themselves. A tree structure would be great for the categories themselves, e.g. any post tagged &quot;2016 compo&quot; would end up in the &quot;homebrew&quot; stream. This is just a pipe dream, though, obviously we must make do with what we've got.<br /><br />The way things are structured here, though, puts posts themselves in very exclusive categories.

The posts themselves are not functionally acting as if they had a hierarchy.<br /><br />Because of the lack of effective structure for posts themselves, an excess of categorization makes it harder for someone interested in multiple topics to get to the information they want. Though there is the &quot;unread posts&quot; feature that bypasses the categories entirely, it is only useful for people like me who are willing to open every thread; if this board had higher traffic I wouldn't find it a useful feature at all, and I think for people who read this board less frequently that tipping point is much lower. (e.g. <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/viewtopic.php?f=5&amp;t=14155" class="postlink">this thread</a> about the SNESdev subforum).<br /><br />Though, if &quot;view unread posts&quot; was customizable and could omit undesired subforums, that would be pretty helpful in mitigating this organizational problem.<br /><br /><br />Anyhow, my objection is still weak. I do have an opinion on it, but I don't really feel that strongly about it, mainly because the unread posts feature is still good enough for me (but it's fragile).<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=5165">rainwarrior</a> — Thu Apr 28, 2016 1:37 pm</p><hr />

Also I kinda think it's weird to start a whole new forum section for a temporary contest that's only going to be a handful of threads that would be plenty relevant to the Homebrew section anyway.<br /><br />I often have trouble trying to figure out which existing category my post is most relevant to. Often times I'm doing something I think is relevant to all of &quot;homebrew&quot; and &quot;music&quot; and &quot;nesdev&quot; <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/viewtopic.php?f=22&amp;t=9521" class="postlink">all at once</a>, and I really don't know where it belongs, and I don't want to cross post, either. So... personally I already think we're overcategorized here.<br /><br />I don't really care, though, since I also use the <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/search.php?search_id=unreadposts" class="postlink">view unread posts</a> and just read every thread. The organization of forums doesn't really affect me very much so it's not like my opinion on this should count for anything. <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" /><p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=5165">rainwarrior</a> — Thu Apr 28, 2016 2:12 am</p><hr />
