		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I'm trying to figure out a way to be able to work on my hobby.  The only time I could have is during the train rush or lunch.
<br />
<br />For this, I was looking at some umpc that are 4.8 inch small and could be used while standing.  The only issue (if you don't consider the price one of them) is they all contain an atom z520 for reducing power consumption.. This would mean the performance should suffer.
<br />
<br />I want to know if some people have umpc with z520 and how does it fare with:
<br />
<br />- Accurate to semi-accurate nes emulators
<br />- visual c# express 2008 (that one I guess won't work but I can still dream)
<br />
<br />I'm sure text editors shouldn't be an issue but before I shell cash on any of those things, I would like to have opinion about people that <strong>have experience with this cpu</strong> (i.e. I don't need to know how much it suck because everyone say so just by looking at the specs, that doesn't help me).

<br />
<br />Visual C#.. The umpc only have 512 meg so I guess that the CPU wouldn't be the only bottle neck. I would still like to test it if I have a chance.
<br />
<br />Thanks for the information.  The price of the umpc is quite steep so I'm not sure yet if I will jump on it or not.  When you have the choice between a <a href="http://jp.kohjinsha.com/models/pa/index.html" class="postlink">400g umpc</a> that you could use anywhere but the price is like 600/700$ but on the other hand you could get a normal netbook for half the price with 1 gig of ram and N280/N450 but you cannot use on the train.. You have to make the decision properly.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />In the end I finally made my decision and went with a normal netbook since there was a risk that the small one was not that useful on the train and be too constrained. At easily more than 150$ extra, I didn't take the risk to see how useful it is.
<br />
<br />Now I'm in the middle of configuring it so I can at last do some nes coding again. The CPU is a N450 (the norm recently) and I did a quick test this morning with 2 emulators.  Nintendulator runs at 26 fps so you can forget it for debugging. As for one version of FCEX, it seems to work fast enough. 
<br />
<br />I'm happy that I waited. The one I got (asus eee pc 1001px) just came out last week in japan.  The screen is mate so no glare because of light. It still come with XP and I'm more than happy with that since win7 starter is quite a piece of junk.
<br />
<br />Can't wait to finish setting it so I can program nes programs/tools again during lunch.

<br />Wow, Nintendulator at 26fps? That makes me reconsider my wish of buying a netbook. How about Nintendulator with the NTSC filter on? I consider this a sort of debugging feature, because it helps when designing graphics and picking colors.

<br />
<br />For Nestopia, I just tested and go results around 35/40 with or without filter.  A netbook is not like a desktop. You should not expect the performance of a thinkpad X series 201s when you pay a few hundreds for them.
<br />
<br />I knew what to expect from it and I'm more than happy with it. It doesn't replace my main computer: it just allow me to type code on the go and do a few basic testing. Before I couldn't even do that so I'm quite happy with that.

<br />I get it, it's just that being such a big NES nerd, running these emulators is kind of important to me. I wasn't sure if current netbooks would be able to run them, but I kind wished they could.

<br />
<br />Personally I took the path to have a mid-sized notebook (14'') that entierely replace my desktop. It it pretty powerful (in fact more than my old desktop ! - even tough it was only 3.5 years old 1 year ago when I changed it) so it runs all emulators and PC games fine, and that extra space it saves on my desktop is really nice (in fact I couldn't imagine to revert now !).
<br />
<br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">That always happens.</div>
<br />Man this is so true !! 6 months ago Lenovo released laptops similar to mine but with Quad-Core CPUs intead of Dual Core, same GHz, same price !
<br />
<br />4 years ago when I mounted my desktop computer, the AMD X2 series of dual cores were released right after I bought my Athlon 64 class CPU - and PCI express just became the norm right after I bought a mother board that lacked it. Not to mention typical RAM on PCs suddently grop from 512Mb to 2GB without a good reason. (and still is in the 2-4GB now a few years later...) You see the picture....
<br />If you are careful to always buy stuff right after a "big" evolution it's alright - but for me I have a tendency to always do the opposite !
<br />
<br />I also tend to buy game consoles just when they're about to get obsolete, but that's another story. This has plenty of advantage - you can get the "slim" revision of the system and you can buy plenty of good used games for it for cheap. However, it usually happens I can't find games I'd like to buy - they're sold out and I can't find them used.

<br />And plenty of disadvantage: it probably has the anti-homebrew patch already on it. That's why I'm drifting toward nettops and other small-form-factor PCs. I just wish there were more PC-native games designed for 2 to 4 gamepads.
