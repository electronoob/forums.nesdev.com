DirectX does have a palette texture format, but I'm not sure if it's widely supported. Alternatively you could write a pixel shader with four colour constants that are blended via the RGBA values in a texture.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=5165">rainwarrior</a> — Fri Feb 24, 2012 11:18 am</p><hr />

Yeah I know 90% of people probably won't notice and I know Mega Man 9/10 would've required like 50 PPUs to work on the NES but I'm trying to keep as strictly to the NES limitations as possible as a sort of challenge to myself, partly for fun.  I am trying really hard to keep in mind stuff like the game can only use four palettes each for sprites and tiles, each with three colors and a transparency color but sometimes I goof, like with the saw up there.<br /><br />However I'm not being insanely strict with things like keeping only so many unique groups of 4X4 tiles in my editing and having so many unique tiles because this would be too meticulous for me to care to do.<br /><br />Speaking of fades, I can make fades that only use the NES palette that I loaded into the game, however, if I want to use hardware acceleration mode which is Direct 3D 8, it doesn't support 256 color mode so then the fades become smooth and in true colors, since for the fading I basically made a huge black sprite that covers the whole screen and uses alpha values.  So I guess you can see how this is a real dilemma for me. :X  I'm gonna try to experiment with pixel shaders to see if I can still get the NES style fades that only use the palette.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=5168">corlenbelspar</a> — Fri Feb 24, 2012 12:18 am</p><hr />

Combining everything that has been said so far with a few limitaitons you can do 5 blades at 60Hz.<br /><br />If you are willing to drop you saw blade size fit in 7x8, If you could offset your sawblade movements always have different ypositions modulo 8<br /><br />You could use 8 1k banks for single pixel offsets within 8 pixels. <br />Each frame of animation of the blades would be another 8 banks.<br />Each of the 4 most onscreen blades would use different 1k banks character sets and you would only update the nametables when crossing an 8 pixel boundary.  Since the blades have the offset y modulo 8, only one blade nametable needs to be update per frame which would be a 72 character update.  For the most offscreen blade, you could use sprites, which would be at most 4 sprites wide, by 4 sprites high (8x16 sprites.)<br /><br />Of course you'd want to use mmc3 scanline interupts to change the character sets before and after the blade section in order to have more tile variety.<br /><br />Fewer blades onscreen at a time is probably the easier way to go though.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=5200">sdwave</a> — Thu Feb 23, 2012 7:20 pm</p><hr />

Well, if you have 4 pixels of padding on either side you don't need the 9th row of tiles. For a larger blade you can literally cut the corners as well, so there's another few tiles you don't need.<br /><br />Anyhow, this is all kinda moot, as the OP isn't actually trying to implement it on an NES anyway. It's probably doable with a some care, as we've been mentioning, but I can't think of any game with large background blocks moving smoothly and independantly, even if it is possible.<br /><br />Castlevania III's gears (which are a combination of bankswitching and sprites for the gear-teeth, if I recall) come to mind, but they don't move around. If you're going for a typical NES look for this sort of thing, look at Castlevania's vertical crushing spikes:<br /><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LvfHnD9IjI#t=1m50s" class="postlink">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LvfHnD9IjI#t=1m50s</a><br /><br />For non-independent motion with a vertical scrolling split, Super Mario 3 or Mega Man 4 are pretty good examples:<br /><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRk-gnLMPQk#t=1m55s" class="postlink">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRk-gnLMPQk#t=1m55s</a><br /><br />If you're trying to make something that looks authentic, I'd stick to things that were actually done, but if you don't, probably only a few people would notice anyway.<br /><br />It might be fun to try and actually implement it for NES though.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=5165">rainwarrior</a> — Thu Feb 23, 2012 6:53 pm</p><hr />

What if the circular interior of the blade, perhaps even the teeth, is done with palette cycling. An 8x8 blade then would not require any tile updates to visualize rotation.  The vertical displacement could be done as described with 1, 2, 4, or 8 unique 1KB CHR-ROM banks, depending on how smooth the displacement is wanted.  I think the drama of a rapid descent could be achieved with a 4-pixel drop (so 2 CHR-ROM banks).  Then you could make a "ratchet" sound to accompany a slow ascent with the same 4-pixel steps as was used in the descent...but slower!  After typing this all up I kinda want to tryit!<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3705">cpow</a> — Thu Feb 23, 2012 6:28 pm</p><hr />

I kinda think the blade picture from OP is just for reference; not expecting it to actually be that size/detail.<br /><br />You could do a lot of the animation work with bank switching, especially on something like MMC3 with its 1k banks. You could have four versions of the blade, each 2 pixels apart vertically, and every second version the blades are animated to a different position. Then you only have to update the background tiles for a blade every fourth frame and you get smoother motion.<br /><br />If the blade is 4x4 tiles, you could fit four ongoing animations in a 1k page that you have four versions of that you switch each frame. 2 of them on the page are moving down, and two moving up. If you're really careful with timing you can have four blades running at once and only have to update the background tiles for one of them per frame.<br /><br />Perhaps just do the green shafts with sprites? since they're vertical they don't eat -too- much of that 8-sprites per line limit.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=5165">rainwarrior</a> — Thu Feb 23, 2012 3:23 pm</p><hr />

In the definition of the problem there are few such objects on the screen, and the green part is 2 sprites wide - so objects at a scanline could take 6-8 sprites, i.e. chances of flicker are great. I would guess that such flicker of part of an object is not much better than flicker of the whole object.<br /><br />Well, it is possible to combine both tiles with attributes and sprites to cover bottom end of the green part in cases when it is goes mid-attribure. This would reduce chances of flicker if the objects are desynced in a special way.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=4205">Shiru</a> — Thu Feb 23, 2012 12:13 pm</p><hr />
