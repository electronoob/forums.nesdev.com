Send me a PM if you're interested in either one and we can go from there.

From helping the Sonic Time Twisted team through most of 2016, as well as rebooting a 16-bit style project called Wonderworld, I've been learning more about game development and working as a team. We're experimenting with ideas to either finish this and release Golds Curse individually or put it into the current project as a part of an extended story.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I haven't seen this thread until now, but wow, this looks really great! Gameplay looks solid, too. <br /><br />I must say I have some trouble with a few notes in the song in the first video. These few notes i found troublesome inject quite a bit of drama, which is fine and exciting on its own, but i think they need to be reeled back into the fold a bit. I feel like i'm missing a release or transition or two; alternately a change of accompanying harmony in preparation for the &quot;wild&quot; ones.

Since so much care has been taken to make it close to NES specs, that might be a possibility.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Thanks for all the compliments, everyone! Means a lot from a community of experts and lets the team know we're going along the right path.  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />For the music, I'll send the critique to the composer, and see what he can do from there! Thanks for the feedback. As for an actual NES port, I'd love to do that someday, but the most important matter is finishing the game first. <br /><br />There's four maps (out of six total) made and functionable in-game, but only two have about 75% of their gimmicks, while the other two are empty gimmick-wise, but explore-able. <br /><br />A minor conflict development wise is the games story ties in to the story of another, 16-bit game we have in the workshop. The issue arises is I can't really decide if <br />A. This game, Golds Curse, should be released individually first, or <br />B. The story of both games would be made stronger by having to find collectibles in the 16-bit game to unlock the 8-bit game, and thus play through the six levels to reveal some lore/origins relating to the 16-bit games story. Basically, a game within a game.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I agree, and I was thinking one doesn't necessarily exclude the other. After a standalone release, you could reuse the code, lift a level (or make a new), and put it into your 16-bit styled game as a throwback to your 8-bit styled release, perhaps.
