<br />
<br />I can't wait to let everyone in, but for now I working out a few kinks (I know on the site it says we but this is just so people would think that not only me is behind this  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" />. Soon you will be able to use this site  and all the features it will provide.  When the site opens the database will be small but later on it will grow and grow  You can always help by adding content to our database or by making donations. This site is not only about nes or famicom it is about all pirte carts and games like pirates for sega, gameboy etc  All content will be added and approved by moderators first and only high res images/scans will be tolerated (there will be some exceptions if good images can not be found. Hope you are exited as i am about opening this site <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /> Also i am planing  on having a mobile version too ... just think about it siting in front of the tv with a pile of carts and a phone in your hand <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />

<br />
<br />So tell me what do you think about the idea.
<br />
<br />Oh and here is some preview of the design:
<br />
<br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://piratecarts.info/beta/">http://piratecarts.info/beta/</a><!-- m -->

<br />Tell me what do you like and what you don't like  or what do you want to be added <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />
<br />
<br />Thanks in advance for reading this long comment and / or taking time to visit  my site

Games not licensed by Nintendo include things like Klax, Action 52, Bee 52, Krazy Kreatures, Battle Kid: Fortress of Peril, Bible Adventures, Bubble Bath Babes, and Little Red Hood. We'll have to find some way to distinguish "legit" unlicensed releases from pirate hacks and multis, or to distinguish Somari and Kart Fighter from Tengen's version of Tetris, etc. It's just a pet peeve of mine when people use <a href="http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/words-to-avoid.html#Piracy" class="postlink">the term "pirate"</a> without specifying what is and isn't "pirate". Perhaps a bit of self-interest is involved: under definitions proposed by some people I could name, some of my own works would be considered "pirate".<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">And this is only a design preview so you can't open anything for now and what do you mean by " pain for its own sake "?

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Well I would admit that, personally, while I have nothing against Unlicenced games (heh, if I ever made a NES game it will definitely be unlicenced so it'd be quite paradoxal for me to be against them !), pirated games, that copies copirighted trademarks and characters off legit games and are pasted on VERY crappy games, such as this FF7-pirate, tends to piss me off.
<br />
<br />First those games sucks, and it is disrespectful for the legit developers who put a lot of trought to make good games to see their work copied in extremely crappy games.
<br />
<br />That being said I have nothing against the projetct - but considering the huge mess pirated games are - good luck making an organized database of them.

The only game I could see having a problem with it something like Noahs Ark on SNES. I mean shouldn't be a big problem IMO. Just have a column that says what it is, pirate or unlicensed. Good luck with this, a pirate database would be really useful! <img src="./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" />

<br />
<br />If, on the other hand, you want to find the middle first and take an "I know it when I see it" approach when determining whether an unlicensed game is pirated, that's fine too. You don't <em>have</em> to set down rigid rules at the start; you can let them emerge from examples.
