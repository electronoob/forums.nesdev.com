	</div><br /><br />Red Xs are removed, green is what I had you add, purple codes are the names of things on my NES-CPU-07 board, the blue resistor is unnecessary but let me explain:<br /><br />At least one game uses the CIC SLAVE RESET output to reset its state. (It's the European multicart Tetris+SMB+Nintendo World Cup). But putting in a large resistor (100k?) from pin 6 to 10, you can make sure that 1- that's a large enough resistor that any CIC stun circuits won't damage anything and 2- that game (and any others) that use it will actually go back to the main menu when you hit the reset button.<br /><br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">jims cool wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">i think that circuit would zap pin 2 of U9</div> No, it won't, the only difference from the original schematic is that now the 1-2 inverter is now driving three inverters and the 2A03 and 2C02 reset inputs instead of just two inverters.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">pin 2 of U9 is output it's tied to pin 3 and 13 inputs. pin 4 is connected to the clock input of the CIC or -5v zapper circuit.. so it could be bad for some games</div> No stun circuits ever drove CIC CLK for precisely this reason; exceeding the voltage limits of the 74'04 wasn't going to let them run. All CIC stun circuits drive one of CIC pins 1, 2, or 10.<br /><br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">satchsatch33 wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">I noticed that I have a NES-CPU-10 mainboard, and you suggest to remove some caps and resistors.</div><br />I can only speak for the NES-CPU-07 board, because I can look at it in front of me. I see no reason to remove either of the capacitors (also labeled in my schematic above). They'll just float now, which is safe if superfluous.<br /><br />Removing the diode, on the other hand, has a point, if you have any unlicensed games with CIC stuns. Because you don't have a reminder that the CIC stun is shorted out (game endlessly rebooting), it could cause the CIC stun to burn itself out.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">rainwarrior wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">Isn't it safer/easier/simpler to replace it with a chip from a game cartridge?</div> Desoldering two ICs and resoldering one IC  -vs-  desoldering one IC and soldering in 2 wires and two passive components? I personally think the latter is easier.

Desoldering an entire IC without the right tools stands a good chance of destroying the donor PCB (which you don't care about here), possibly damaging the IC, and the resoldering a more complex solution also stands a chance of damaging the NES mainboard.<br /><br />Just follow either of our directions. Are you blocking on finding the right size capacitor? Anything where R×C is at least 10ms should be fine. If you want suggestions, what do you have lying around? You could steal the capacitor C8 (which is 0.1µF) from right next to the CIC socket if that's what you're having trouble finding.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">rainwarrior wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">I'm sure lidnariq and jims cool have solutions that work well, but I do personally think it's easier just to replace the chip.
