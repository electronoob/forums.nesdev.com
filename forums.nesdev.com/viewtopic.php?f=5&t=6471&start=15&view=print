<br />All the people that like Metal Gear would still like it.  But those people that find cutscenes boring would also like it more.  Everyone wins when they're skippable.  There's no reason not to put it in every game.

<br />Wrong according to one Disch.  Everyone else is just fine with learning important information in their cutscenes.
<br />
<br />When you think about it, a majority of cutscenes relay important information, and players who don't watch them are at a disadvantage.  In Metal Gear it can be the simple fact of showing players the layout of the room prior to fighting a boss, as well as alerting them that a boss fight is starting.  People who skip the scene before it have no right to complain when they get shot in the chest after they choose "skip."
<br />
<br />Or even Mario games.  The Galaxy games give you a quick flyby of the level as you first enter it, showing you the layout and potentially the location of hidden items.  If I accidentally press a button and skip it, it doesn't make them bad designers for not including a "watch intro flyby again" button on the pause screen.  They've got signs and NPCs everywhere explaining things you need to do; it doesn't make them a bad designer if I find this immersion-breaking.  It makes me a picky player, just as your own opinions make you a picky player.

<br />
<br />To be honest what I don't like is when you have to go trough 10 minutes of cut-scenes before being able to play anything. The best is short and breath-taking opening, like in Final Fantasy VII for example.
<br />I also loathe where there is a mandatory tutorial - often I like to experiment things on the fly during gameplay. If you make a tutorial make it either integrated into the story (Fire Emblem GBA) or fully optional.

<br />Right, and some people don't even like what Fire Emblem GBA does.  I've heard people go so far as to call Lynn's entire chapter a tutorial, and they wish they could skip it and get to the "real game" when they restart.

<br />
<br />You know, even when cutscenes are DA SHIT, perfect in every possible way, I will still most likely only want to watch them the first couple of times I play through the game. They should always be skippable.
<br />
<br />I also believe that games should be self-contained products. I shouldn't need a manual or any info besides what's on the cartridge/CD/other media in order to play it... You see, these things may get lost with time, pausing the game to look stuff up somewhere else is not convenient at all, and so on. I would most likely get frustrated with a game like that and move on without thinking twice.

<br />
<br />Fine, you're right.
<br />
<br />I disagree with your design ideas.  I think there are better, more interesting, and more dynamic ways to inform the player of their in game surroundings than solely putting things in cutscenes.  I've mentioned some of ideas of how it could easily be accomplished in this thread.
<br />
<br />I also think that games which use these other methods are better for it,  are less likely to frustrate (and therefore alienate) the player, and are therefore designed better.
<br />
<br />But that is just one man's opinion.  I'll concede that it's not fact.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />For what it's worth, I'm in agreement with Disch here.  Making cutscenes or drama-scenes (think Ninja Gaiden) skippable is more or less a requirement.  If the player/user wants to skip said scenes, they'll press a button/whatever.  If they don't, that's their choice too.  If the scene in question is actually a training sequence and they skip it, so what -- it's their own fault/demise.
<br />
<br />The modus operandi for not permitting cutscene skipping seems to be either paranoia or vengeance; I can't tell which.
<br />
<br />Do you know how many NES and SNES games I've played where I've skipped tutorials, cut-scenes, etc. simply to get back to the gameplay -- instead referring to the user manual for details?  Many.  :-)

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Well, well just wanted to point something :
<br />I don't know how many of you know about the GBA Mega Man Battle Network series, it's basically RPG Mega Man games. There is 6 of them, and it's pretty obvious the game engine has been completely revised between 3 and 4 (I'm talking about overworld game engine, not battles which are similar in all 6 games). This makes 1-3 use game engine A, and 4-6 uses game engine B.
<br />
<br />1-3 have skippable cut-scenes, and 4-6 have non-skippable cut-scenes.
<br />Because the story of the games is kind of significant, you'd want to watch the scene at least once. However, like in the NES Mega Man games, the bosses needs quite some strategy to be beaten and it's very unlikely you'll success on your first try. This is why it's really annoying to have non-skippable cutscenes in 4-6 : You're forced to watch the scenes before the boss again and again.
<br />
<br />HOWEVER, I found myself skipping important scenes in MMBN1-3 by pressing a button by accident, which to be honest just as annoying. I'm not saying cut-scenes should be unskippable, but they shouldn't be too easily skippable. The best is : Player press "start", then the game go to a screen where it brings a menu like "skip - resmue - rewind". That way everyone is happy. Rare are games who actually does this tough, Final Fantasy 12 is one of them, but the story line of this game is in my opinion pure crap (very unlike all it's predecessor) so well... at least you can skip the crap.
<br />
<br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"> <br /><br />I will say, however, that everyone I know IRL cares very little for in game cutscenes and just want to play the game.

<br />You aren't the great majority of gamers, nor am I or anyone else here. If you include all granddads who play Wii sport, Nintendogs and all this crap in the majority of gamers, then you're probably right. However, I wouldn't consider them gamers.
<br />You'd be surprised that many casual gamers actually play RPGs almost only for their story and the easier the game is, the better for them. I have my sis in mind here (okay she's not the majority of gamers either), and to be honnest I don't quite understand what is the point of playing if you don't care about the gameplay.
<br />
<br />However, it's not because most of you play NES games all day, and that NES games never have any cutscenes (exept Ninja Gaiden) that cutscenes are bad. They aren't necessary for a good game (we all know SMB, etc...), but honnestly a good story and good/fun scenes really makes a game very supperior to the average (see the FF series).

<br />
<br />90% of messages on this thread are about cutscenes, maybe time to split? I would rather hear suggestions of good indie games. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />
