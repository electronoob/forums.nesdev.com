The main drawback is doubled memory use, but it would only make major difference if there are many large sprites in the game.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I checked my metasprite routine, and it looks like (if I counted correctly): <br /><br />One time penalty per metasprite:<br /><br />- a penalty of either 9 or 15 cycles if flipped horizontally (depends if clipping needs adjustment)<br />- a penalty of either 7 or 13 cycles if flipped vertically<br /><br />- additional penalties of 3 cycles per hardware tile if flipped (6 per tile if both flipped)<br /><br />There might be a few more cycles, since I am not counting the fact that there are branches for both modes that would not be needed without supporting flipping, but I don't think it is a big deal. I use a left to right, top to bottom pattern in my algorithm and reverse it if the sprite is flipped either way. (Edit: actually the impact is slightly less when the Y position of the tiles doesn't change.)

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I'm personally not a fan of the pre-flipped sprite maps approach. It can waste a ton of ROM space, and also increase the complexity of other code. I imagine you have to have some conditional code that says &quot;If this object is facing right, use sprite map X. Otherwise, use sprite map Y.&quot; You would need a way to identify the locations of those individual maps.<br /><br />I took a different approach. I don't really care so much about vertical flipping, so objects can either be normal, or flipped horizontally. The metasprite drawing code looks at an object's flip status, and decides to go to one of two routines: DrawNormal, or DrawFlipped. These two routines are hardcoded to flip or not flip the sprites in a metasprite. The main time saver is that the DrawFlipped routine subtracts the sub-coordinates of each 8x8 sprite from the object coordinates instead of adding them. This ends up saving a lot of time.<br /><br />I used to have one routine that would handle both flipped and unflipped metasprites. It would always add individual sprite sub-coordinates to the main object coordinates, but do some XORing when objects were flipped to add negative values instead of positive ones. This ended up wasting several scanlines alone.

Otherwise, use sprite map Y.&quot; You would need a way to identify the locations of those individual maps.</div><br /><br />In my top-down adventure game, (almost) every actor has at least four directions they can face. To keep processing to a minimum, I store all four animations separately and in order of direction (#0=up, #1=down, ...). To change an animation to a certain direction:<br /><br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">&nbsp; &nbsp;; X = obj id#<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;lda Object_Direction, X<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;clc<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;adc #ANIMID<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;jmp Func_ChangeAnim<br /></div><br /><br />If an actor moves in eight directions, but only has four animations:<br /><br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">&nbsp; &nbsp;; X = obj id#<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;lda Object_Direction, X<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;tay<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;lda anim_8wTo4w, Y<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;clc<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;adc #ANIMID<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;jmp Func_ChangeAnim<br /></div><br /><br />&quot;anim_8wTo4w&quot; is a table that converts the diagonals to cardinal directions. Usually diagonals just drop the left and right, so UR and UL use the UP animation, DR and DL use DOWN.<br /><br />It does &quot;waste&quot; a ton of space, but I decided early on for this project that cpu cycles &gt; ram &gt; rom. Since most of the actors are 16x16, a large amount of frames and some animations can be reused for unrelated actors that share the same tile ids, but are in different tilesets.

Did you get this info from .nes ROMs? Those values might even have been selected by the people who dumped the games, and not reflect how the solder pads in the actual games are configured... who knows?

You're not just facing left or right, but also up/down. Plus, if you're like Bregalad, you might want to show objects holding things in the appropriate hands when flipped.<br /><br />My project was intended to be an NROM platformer. For this reason, I need to be cautious about space being used. But being a scrolling platformer, pretty much everything that happens takes up a lot of CPU time. It's hard to say which is more important in my case: CPU time, or ROM space. I really didn't want to sacrifice either. Thankfully, my solution sacrificed a fixed amount of ROM space (for the hardcoded flipped drawing code), and a tiny amount of time per object.
