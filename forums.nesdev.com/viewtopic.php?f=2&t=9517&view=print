		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Some time ago back at the very beginning I was in NESDev in 2004, the NESDev main page used to show off NES demoes made by a couple of people active in the communauty.<br /><br />Those are still here as today on the NESdev main page : <a href="http://nesdev.com/#NESPrograms" class="postlink">http://nesdev.com/#NESPrograms</a><br /><br />Is there any chances more recent demoes, by myelf and by other people, could be uploaded ? Becaure right now there is not really official place to upload suff, and temporary links tends to disappear...

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I had someone volunteer to redo and update the main page.  For whatever reason I just loathe the idea of changing it (because of it's simplicity maybe, plus I just realized the index page design is nearly <em>half as old as the NES/FC itself</em>), but certainly it does need updating.<br /><br />Best place for now I'd say would be the Projects section of the forum.  Thankfully, the new forum allows attachments.  Initially it only allowed images, but it's been changed to allow ZIP files and stuff.  Everyone should feel free to upload their stuff directly to the forum!  I also hate links to temporary storage sites and such, it's always annoying.<br /><br />Also I'm still offering free web hosting to whomever here needs it.  At membler-industries.com.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />OK I think I'll follow membler's advice and upload my demoes to the Projects section of the forum. That way if I suddenly die or whatever my demoes will not be lost for the NESdev community.<br /><br />EDIT : This would still have the major inconvenient that it'd be hard to find them for someone looking for them. The NESDev main page should be a better choice in my opinion, but it's up to the admins to decide of course.

That'd be a bit more permanent than forum uploads.<br /><br />Another place for homebrew releases would be <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://pdroms.de/">http://pdroms.de/</a><!-- m --> which would be a great site - if it'd be working... I haven't be able to download anything from there in past 10-15 years, either it's bugging on older browsers... or, the newest effect is that it's telling me that my OS is so old that I can't possibly be a living person ;-) and instead I must be a spam-bot and don't even get read-access to the webpage :-(

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Occasionally, the publisher of a non-free operating system will announce the operating system's end of life. For example, Microsoft operating systems go EOL about seven years after their successor comes out. One disadvantage of running an EOL operating system is that you can't get patches for newly disclosed security vulnerabilities. Windows 98 and Windows 2000 had new vulnerabilities disclosed within weeks after EOL, which Internet worms have exploited. Some webmasters will block user agents running on vulnerable operating systems in order to convince them to switch to an operating system that still gets updates. If the PC that you use for web browsing does not meet the hardware requirements of Windows 7, consider Xubuntu or Lubuntu.<br /><br />In other cases, a web site might use shared web hosting because it isn't big enough for a VPS. It may want users to log in with SSL so that a third partie can't sniff and forge users' session cookies. Internet Explorer on Windows XP does not support using SSL with shared hosting, and neither does Android Browser on Android 2.x. The workaround here is to use Opera or Firefox.<br /><br />nocash: What web browser and operating system are you using? (If you don't feel like disclosing this publicly, you can PM me.)
