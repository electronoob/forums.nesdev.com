It takes me around 30 minutes too, with a regular soldering iron and a solder sucker. The chip may come off in one piece or may loose some legs during the process. It really depends. I'm not worried about destroying MASK ROMs though, since if the devcart works you can just program that same game and put those chips in. So you don't actually loose the game...<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=95">tokumaru</a> — Mon May 22, 2006 9:41 am</p><hr />

I know I've said this before on this forum but wire wrap wire is ideal for devcarts. It's just the right size, comes in spools of different colours and is reliable. It's really cheap. You buy a little tool like a small screwdriver which connects the wire to the pins and also removes the insulation. It's very cheap and available from almost any electronic shop like RadioShack. Also the cheap bulb desoldering iron from RadioShack ($12) makes taking out mask rom easy and safe. I can take a 32 pin mask out in around 5 minutes with no damage. I also found a used weller soldering station on eBay that was pretty cheap. I've used it for a few years now and it makes soldering a real pleasure. If you're going to do electronics for your whole life it makes sense to buy some good tools (used if you're on a budget).<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=236">Lloyd Gordon</a> — Mon May 22, 2006 6:39 am</p><hr />

Yes, it is isoleted in some red stuff, but it is not plastic, and it looks like plain copper, but it actually is an isolation that melt when you solder.<br />It's good if you're getting better at sldering. I really DO hate soldering. I'm unable to solver something with more than 8 pins without totally destroying it. I tried to disolver a CIC, but I totally failed, most pins were broken, and it was only 14 pins, I think. Disolvering pins isn't a problem at first, but when you removed solver on all pins, you notice that the chip still is fixed to the PCB and don't want to move. Then I have to figure wich pins are badly fixed and from here things get worse and worse to go to the catastrophe.<br />I also hate soldering wires, because they're always moving. You need a hand to hold the iron and the other to hold the solder, so you need to trick to have your wire hold where you want it to be soldered, and this is quite hard, because you have to use the same hand that hold the soder and.... whatever, it is so horrible.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=38">Bregalad</a> — Sat May 20, 2006 2:08 pm</p><hr />

Oh, I never thought about that. But I know what you're saying about your wire, I think. Is it insolated in some red rubbery stuff? One thing I don't like is when wires like that have such a tiny end, it is hard to solder. Like my 9V battery snap that I soldered to the end of my NES cord, the ends were so tiny, and it is not soldered on there very well. I guess I'm getting alot better at soldering. I successfully desoldered my CPU when trying to build my CopyNES, and I was told that was extremely difficult. It wasn't that hard for me. The pins were a little bent, but it made it out okay. I can still play on the system, but I've never successfully dumped a game on to my computer.<br /><br />I'm excited to continue on with this project! I hope it works, I really do.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=138">Celius</a> — Sat May 20, 2006 12:19 pm</p><hr />

It's a shame for your broken EPROM. Dissolvering a chip with more than 8 pins without damage is hard to impossible, at least for me.<br />You basically have 2 methods for rewiring. Cut track, and place wires with the track that was leading to the pin, by scratching the track or sometimes you'll find a hole that change the side of the PCB for the track that will serve as a solder point if you're lucky.<br />You can also bend pins up, and solder the wire in the hole, that is exactly the same. I prefer cut tracks, but if you prefer bend pins that really doesn't matter.<br />Normally you don't have to wire to a hole where there is already a pin in, exept for VCC and GND, but then solder the wire on the pad next to the pin.<br />To wire pin 1 to VCC, if you bend it up you'll have to place a wire across the chip, that's the easier way to do that. You could also found some other point that is connected to VCC or GND. On my datasheets, they say VPP can be either state. I don't know if it really matter if that pins is connected to something or not, but I'd not leave it floating just to be safe, espectially considering that all EPROMs are CMOS technology, and that leave floating is forbidden in CMOS technology chip whatever you happen to be doing, because you are getting parasited and you consumme useless power. LS technology chips don't matter if unused pins are leave floating.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=38">Bregalad</a> — Sat May 20, 2006 11:08 am</p><hr />

So I should just bend up the pins, and have wires from those pins to those holes, even when they're occupied by other pins? Just making sure, so I don't screw anything up. I desoldered my chip, bent the following pins up, and one was bent a little weird, so I bend it a little more, and it broke off. So I'll be continuing this project in about a week or so, when my new EPROMs arrive.<br /><br />And also, about your last step. Are you saying to have a wire going across the 27C040? From pin 1 to pin 32?<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=138">Celius</a> — Sat May 20, 2006 10:19 am</p><hr />

First, I'd like to say that my FF3j cart was $8, so it's not that much of a loss. I can buy a boxed copy for $25 at the end of the month, and I'm going to do that.<br /><br />Okay, I really see now this was like the dumbest idea ever, because I have no idea what I'm talking about when it comes to pinouts. How would I figure such a thing out? I assumed that this was going to be okay, because I asked if I could just program the chip, and replace the PRG (which is still in good condition by the way, and I can solder it back in if I want) with the EPROM, and nobody said no, so I thought it'd be okay.

You soldered the FF3 translated INSTED OF THE REAL FF3 ??? Are you crazy ? Don't you know you're taking risk to destroy a very rare cartridge ???<br />Anyway, you have to do some modifications. I don't know what they are, because pure TNROM rewiring isn't doccumented, due to the rare board (it is HVC-TNROM, right ?).<br />So, if you just put another EPROM in the slot of a real FF3j rom, you have to compare the pinout of a NES 512kb PRG chip, and the pinout of your 27C040 chip, and rewire all pins that are different. If you don't do that, of course it will not work.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=38">Bregalad</a> — Thu May 18, 2006 10:17 am</p><hr />

You're trying to do a home made FF3 cartridge, right ? Didn't you say you bought the real FF3 boxed cartridge ? Or do you just not want to play it in japaneese ?<br />Did you put a RAM chip instead the CHROM chip of the original TKROM card an follow all the instructions by drk314 to convert to TNROM ? Did you glue the pad for CHR /WR ? Did you make sure it has good contact ? I neved did that, I made only a FF2 card, becuase I just don't have any TKROM board to destroy. But I think glue a pad while being sure it will make good contact to the NES connector would be pretty hard.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=38">Bregalad</a> — Wed May 17, 2006 8:52 am</p><hr />
