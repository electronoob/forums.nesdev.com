		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Hi all.The clock is ticking, christmas draw near and...MOE1 is about to be finished soon.I was recently thinking about password system.Password was supposed to be given to player when he finishes MOE1, he would be able to use the password to continue the game in MOE2.Password should have info wbout how long player pleyed the game, how many lifes has left and some more info.
<br />But then, I'v got another idea.Developing game in Chapters, but within 1 ROM.The first chapter would be MOE1, like normal-just one game.MOE2, however, would be a ROM that contains MOE1 and MOE2 together.This way I can use MMC3 to save states of some things(like lives left, etc) with SRAM.
<br />Player can simply download updated game, with new chapter and start game off the bat, with all his personal choices made.
<br />What do you think about this style of developing games?
<br />Now, about WHY I want to develop in chapters: Looks like it's my personality, or something. I can easily give up when I'm just left alone and I have to do lot.That's one of the reasons why I gave up with Dizzy Rainy Day.(May finish it someday).Feedback from MOE0 helped me much.It was like a..hmm..fuel for a car, I'm running out of motivation now.If I erlease it and it will also give me some good feedback, I'll get motivation to develop MOE2.
<br />
<br />Since I plan to have 5 chapters, and SRAM I'll need a mapper other than UNROM.And here's my other question: What do you think about homebrew developed using Pirate mapper? I have Mapper 192 in my mind.I want to use it becasue of need for CHR RAM, and CHR ROM.Basicly it's MMC3 but with extra 4kb for CHR RAM.Dizzy games need to have CHR RAM(unless game have small number of items, or you want to waste a lot of CHR ROM) because of items.And I want CHR ROM because i can have some neat tricks(BG animations, "breaking" 256 tiles per screen limit etc.).
<br />
<br />So,let me know your opinions! <img src="./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" />

<br />MMC3 with a 32 KiB CHR RAM can already be expressed in NES 2.0.
