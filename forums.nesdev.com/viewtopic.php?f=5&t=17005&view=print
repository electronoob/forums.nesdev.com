I'm not giving specific details, and I hesitated to even ask this question, for fear of looking like an entitled whiner.<br /><br />Is it normal for an actor with a speaking role in a movie to have to buy a ticket to see his own movie, or even be locked out of it entirely due to not owning compatible proprietary viewer hardware or software or living in a country where it is not available? Does it change if the movie is a work of fiction or a documentary? Or if the role is paid or unpaid? Or union or non-union?<br /><br /><a href="http://people.com/celebrity/stars-who-dont-watch-themselves-on-screen/" class="postlink">&quot;Jared Leto, Julianne Moore &amp; More Celebs Who Say They Can't Watch Themselves on Screen&quot; by Diana Pearl</a> lists a bunch of actors, most of whom choose not to watch their own works. But the first on the list, <em>Full House</em> star Jodie Sweetin, has never had a chance to see an episode of <em>Full House</em> because she doesn't own a TV. Is a situation like that common or uncommon?

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I think it's similar to (or even a much stronger version of) the phenomenon where people often find it uncomfortable or strange to listen to a recording of themselves speaking. <br /><br />The Jodi Sweetin quote sounds much less like being &quot;locked out&quot; of anything and more like a general disinterest in watching television. (She mentions having Netflix, and Full House is available on Netflix.)

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I don''t think it's normal for an actor not to be <em>able</em> to watch their own movie. A complimentary copy of some kind is a very reasonable expectation. Even if for unpaid work, or I should say <em>especially</em> if unpaid. (However, I'm sure a lot of dubious companies neglect to do this.)<br /><br />It is similar with game companies, the places I've seen <em>not</em> have a policy of giving every employee a complimentary copy after it ships are generally the kind that take the money and run, likely to try to skip some actual wages as well.<br /><br /><br />The other phenomenon of actors not <em>wanting</em> to watch themselves in the finished movie is fairly common though. (This is irrelevant to the above, however. They still deserve a copy, and usually would own one.) Though, there is a difference between refusing to watch yourself at all, and not watching the finished product. There's usually a practical necessity to see yourself in some form as you're working, but by the time the project is edited and finished your work is long cold, and very much out of your hands and under someone else's control.<br /><br />I've also known animators who have not watched the finished film that they worked (for years) on, and <em>many</em> game developers who have never played the finished version of a game they worked on. Part of it is just how different it is to experience something like this when you've been inside every little thing of it, with magnified scrutiny, and now it's been cut down to a single version, and probably not quite in the form you would have done it if you had more power over the finished product.<br /><br />It's a just plain different experience to view your own stuff, and it's not really necessary to force yourself to do it if you don't like it.<br /><br /><br />(I personally am not this kind of person. I've played through all the games I've worked on*, and the one I'm currently on is 100% mine and I don't have QA employees so I'm playing it through multiple times per day at this point. Similarly, I'm not an actor but I've gladly watched every video I've knowingly appeared in.)

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />But then, i imagine you appear as yourself in those films? (that can be uncomfortable for some, too). Seeing yourself acting can sometimes be ghastly by comparison. Worse still if you act as somebody you have a hard time sympathizing with. According to cinema legend, Bruno Ganz was shook when seing himself as hitler in Das Untergang. The exact details unknown and unsure, it's not hard to imagine.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Additional note to my last statement above:<br /><br />* Actually I just realized I've never played Rocksmith, which I technically did work on though I am uncredited, and it was definitely one of those shady situations where I never got a copy and also I didn't actually get paid for some of the work. (Ubisoft is not in the wrong here, I was doing work for a subcontracted developer whom they paid fairly... it just never trickled down to me from there.)

But if you're one small part, or an extra, I wouldn't necessarily expect special treatment. I've bought a copy of an O'Reilly book because it had a page about one of my games. I didn't get a free copy, nor would I expect to.  <br /><br />In particular, if the issue is the technology for you to watch it, I wouldn't expect the content creator to go out of their way to provide you with technology if the lack of sufficient technology is a lifestyle choice. (in your example, I wouldn't expect the producers of Full House to buy a TV for Jodie Sweetin. Nor would I expect a content creator to go out of their way for me because I run linux instead of a more mainstream consumer OS)

You are not an employee of them, nor are you really a direct participant in their work. You put something into the public arena, and they are responding to it independently.<br /><br />In contrast, if someone interviewed me I would expect <em>at the very least</em> to see a finished version of the interview. Not necessarily a whole book, but <em>absolutely</em> the part I contributed to.<br /><br />At every <em>reputable</em> game company I've worked for, all employees would get a copy of the game after shipping, even QA. For some people I knew who worked in dedicated QA for a large company where they went through tons of games, even there they had a policy of X free games per year or something like that.

(...and most would attend the premiere.)<br /><br />Even the ones that don't want to watch the finished movie, though, almost certainly have seen footage of themselves during production (e.g. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dailies" class="postlink">dailies</a>). There's a big difference in utility between watching your work the same day, and watching a heavily edited and composited version a year later.<br /><br />...and if you're one of those people who is creeped out by seeing yourself on a theatre screen, that probably strongly outweighs the very marginal utility of seeing that detached, delayed, edited by someone else version of yourself. Don't forget as well, even within a scene it's all pieces of different takes, out of order, etc. there's a huge disconnect between what you did and what it is at that point.

You can train a keen sense to know when you're in or out of character. There are different schools of acting; performative, or stanislavskiyan, for example, where you immerse yourself in your role taking over its fears, quirks, ambitions, relations and drives as your own. These different schools all have their different tricks and measures.<br /><br />Watching yourself is a helpful tool among others, but it's not the only one.
