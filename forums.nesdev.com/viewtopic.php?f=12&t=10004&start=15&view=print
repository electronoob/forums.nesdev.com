I did just that I figured out how to get the breakpoints working found where it writes only once to 2100 and just replaced it with my register write and now starfox 1 runs at 57 mhz.<br /><br />What's interesting is in the config register (3037) if I set the &quot;IRQ Interrupt Mask&quot; to disable irq both starfox 1 and starfox 2 are capable of overclocking much faster.  I wonder why this is.  Stunt race fx it seems to make no difference, same with doom.  Also good to know that starfox 2 does set the mode, I guess the speed boost is just from me disabling irq in the config.</div><br /><br />Isn't 60MHz an insanely high frequency for SuperFX chip?? At such a high frequency, power consumption is about x36 times more than at 10MHz (since power is quadratic to frequency), SNES's power supply could not make it with the increasing current demand and some timing issues could appear inside GSU... Are you sure that hack of yours is safe?<br />If so,  it could be AWESOME to check it. Is there anny video or something so we could see ourselves that speed increase? Do you know how many FPS do you get with this hack?<br /><br />As for disabling &quot;IRQ Interrupt Mask&quot;, I thought this interruption was used by GSU to interrupt CPU when the requierd calculation are finished, so maybe disabling it could make the game crash at any point. Or maybe am I wrong?

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Sure it's the least I can do for all the help I got from here.  I mostly used the amazing nocash superfx asm information here:<br /><br /><a href="http://nocash.emubase.de/fullsnes.htm#snescartgsunprogrammablerisccpuakasuperfxmariochip10games" class="postlink">http://nocash.emubase.de/fullsnes.htm#snescartgsunprogrammablerisccpuakasuperfxmariochip10games</a><br /><br />Before I started romhacking starfox 1 was the only game I had that would run at super speeds.  I figured that maybe this was because starfox 1 is the only game programmed for the mario chip therefore it doesn't enable extra hardware functions added in the gsu series chips such as the double speed internal clock.  Superfx roms enable double speed mode by writing to 3039.  You can either find the code using a debugger or just by searching the rom using a hex editor.  I just do a search for &quot;A9 01 8D 39 30&quot;.  Then I change the &quot;39 30&quot; to &quot;35 30&quot; since 3035 is unused to disable double speed mode.<br /><br />Disabling double speed mode is important because it allows you to double your overclock speed before you reach the limit.  The more you overclock the smoother the game becomes, so it's important to to make the rom as overclockable as possible.  Changing the &quot;IRQ Interrupt Mask&quot; is a little bit different.  Writing to 3037 lets you configure both the &quot;IRQ Interrupt Mask&quot; and the multiplier speed.  I noticed whether the multiplier speed is set to high or standard the overclocking limit is still the same, but for some reason setting the &quot;IRQ Interrupt Mask&quot; to &quot;disable irq&quot; allows some games to overclock faster.  Here's what starfox does when overclocked past 48 mhz before I disabled the irq interrupt mask:<br /><br /><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zt29sSn7B3Y" class="postlink">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zt29sSn7B3Y</a><br /><br />After setting the &quot;IRQ Interrupt Mask&quot; to &quot;disable irq&quot; this problem went away.  Starfox 2 would flicker a lot past 48 mhz, and vortex would just freeze.  All these problems went away and all these games could overclock much faster once I disabled the irq interrupt mask.  Again use a debugger or a hex editor to look for writes to 3037, sometimes the rom will be writing &quot;20&quot;, sometimes &quot;A0&quot;, maybe even 80.  I usually change the value to set it the same way and also disable the irq mask.  If the rom is writing &quot;20&quot; to 3037 I change it to write &quot;A0&quot; which is the same settings just with the irq mask disabled.<br /><br />Starfox 1 was a bit of a pain because it didn't set this stuff so I had to hijack the first write command to 2100 and turn that into setting the rom to high multiplier speed and disabling the irq mask.  All other games set these modes so you can hunt down the code and change it without overwriting something else.<br /><br />Once your rom is burned, wire it up (there's gsu 1 / 2 maskrom pinouts in google).  Next find the clock trace on the gsu 1 / 2 and completely disconnect that trace from everything.  Wire up a wire for vcc, ground, and a third wire connecting to the gsu 1 / 2 clock trace, and wire in a four pin crystal oscillator of whatever speed you desire.<br /><br />For some strange reason the ram chip on the stunt race fx cart allows you to overclock faster.  I have no idea why, the ram chip that comes on the doom pcb can't overclock as fast.  I transplanted the ram chip from a stunt race fx pcb onto a doom pcb and suddenly games on the doom pcb could overclock faster.  Therefore I recommend using stunt race fx as a donor cart, it even has a battery saving circuit.  The only thing the stunt race fx pcb can't do is run 16 mbit games like doom and mario world 2, but mario world 2 doesn't need overclocking, and even using these tricks I can't get doom to overclock very fast.<br /><br />Also today I applied the same tricks to the vortex rom and now vortex runs happily at 55 mhz.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I've watched your various videos and I must say I'm rather impressed, however you keep saying things like 'running smoother'.  To my eyes the games are not running any smoother at all, just faster and it is plainly obvious that various music and SFX cues are getting cut off way too early.<br /><br />Having said that however, proving that the SFX can run at a much greater clockspeed than stock is a significant technical achievement and may just get someone with the will/time/knowhow to hack the games to use the extra runtime to truly run <em>smoother</em>.  Until then I'm keeping my own SFX projects at stock speed.

The Super FX sits between the cartridge port and the ROM chip. DSP sits on the same bus as the cartridge port and ROM which enables the passthrough to work. <br /><br />Now if you mean can you play your Star Fox cartridge while it is on top of the GDSF7, it might work but I usually had issues with glitches when trying to play carts with coprocessors from the top of the GDSF7. <br /><br />Hojo, you are correct and I've pointed this out many times. While overclocking has potential, until the game code is modified to actually take advantage of it properly it's not that interesting just to play the game on fast forward.

It would take some extensive hacking of the ROM to add new frames, but now that we know it can be overclocked, it opens the door for someone to do exactly that. So instead of pointing out the obvious or reiterating what Mottzilla has said every time Drakon comes up with a new way of increasing the speed of the game, use this as knowledge as means to influence those who would know how to modify the ROM to create additional frames to render.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I never claimed more frames were added, I claimed the framerate increases.  I never once said more frames get added I just said the framerate is sped up.<br /><br />Anyway I discovered that some superfx carts can overclock 2-3 mhz faster on certain games.  There's no way to tell which ones can it's just trial and error.  I have one gsu 2 cart that runs all games 2-3 mhz faster, one gsu 1 cart that runs all games 2-3 mhz, one gsu 2 cart that runs only starfox 2 2-3 mhz faster, and a bunch of gsu 2 / gsu 1 carts that run games 2-3 mhz slower than these faster carts.  I guess once you get up around those speeds it's luck of the draw what your gsu chip is capable of keeping up with.
