Excellent, I was hoping it looked so good.<br />As far as designs on the shield goes: I want to, but I'm not going to touch that yet. Right now I'm going for a really barren look until I've got much, much more of the game drawn out and coded before I worry about that since I may decide to have equippable shields with different graphics. I dunno, man, CHR RAM is exciting. That's probably way too much though.<br /><br />...yeah, it does look lopsided. I was going for some shading sorta. It looks better when the shield's tiles are isolated:<br /><div class="attachtitle">Attachment:</div><div class="attachcontent">

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />What I meant is that, you should consider use skin colour for the sword instead of gray. Gray for armor is fine for me.<br /><br />Yes, a sword might look &quot;gray&quot; in real life, but it is shiny metal gray, not dark-stone gray. Since the weapon in an action video game is what you use to hurt enemies it is particularly important and its graphical representation should stand out.<br /><br />This is of couse just my opinion.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Using the skin color for the sword is another interesting option. I took some inspirations for the sprites from Willow, and looking to willow again it looks like the sword and shield constitute a third palette. I haven't played enough of the game to see how this effects enemy colors though. As I get more art drawn out for enemies and such I'll revisit this idea and see if I can spare an extra color for the sword, or if changing it to flesh tones looks better. <br />Thanks.
