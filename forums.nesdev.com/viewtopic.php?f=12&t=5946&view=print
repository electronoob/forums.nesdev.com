<br />
<br />Did you buy this unit just recently or just get it out of storage? Or have you had it awhile and suddenly this error started? It's possible the Floppy Drive is damaged or worn out and needs repair or replacement. If you have the means to load games via Parallel Port you can use that instead. It's preferable anyway as Floppy Disk loading is pretty slow.

<br />so it's new, but i don't buy a power supply with it im using one that you can set your self.
<br />
<br />it's set to 9v dc, I just set it to 12v to see if it would work but it hasn't!
<br />
<br />any other ideas?

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Don't use 12v. Use 9v dc. If you have only just tried it, it would seem most likely you got a GDSF7 with a dead floppy drive. Did you buy it from an individual or a store? Though either way the simple thing to do would be to open the GDSF7 carefully, remove the floppy drive and find another one with the Data and Power connectors in the same placement as the cables aren't really long enough to fit drastically different connector placement. 
<br />
<br />Hopefully a new drive will fix it. But again the Parallel Port link with a PC is much faster and better.

<br />
<br />Yeah i want to know how to do that, I downloaded ucon64 but im not sure what the command is?
<br />
<br />aslo can you save your games when you do that?
<br />like send the save file to the pc and then send it back to the sf7 when you have loaded the rom.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />If you got it from Tototek it should be in decent shape. Did you do as they asked and used Brand New/Never Used Floppy Disks? Older floppy disks might cause problems. I would advise you to talk to Tomy at Tototek about the problem. And yes you can do save games with the parallel port. With UCON64 you type something like " ucon64.exe somegame.smc -gd3 " to convert it to GD3 format. Then type something like " ucon64.exe sf8smw -xgd6 " to send the ROM while in "Linking" mode on the GDSF7. 
<br />
<br />Things to keep in mind are parallel transfers are harder to do on Windows NT, 2K, XP, and Vista. In order to do them you must install a driver to allow parallel port use. UCON64's readme and install documents should detail this. The easiest way though is to use an old computer (like a laptop) with Windows 98 on it. Also keep in mind you may have to adjust in the BIOS the parallel port "mode" to get transfers working. It's highly dependent on the computer you use.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />No problem. Remember to convert your games to GDSF format with UCON64. Also if you format your disks to 1.6MB and use a custom splitter you can split games into 1.5 Megabyte pieces rather than 1 Megabyte pieces which makes games of 20&amp;24 megabits take only 2 disks instead of 3 and makes 32 megabit games take only 3 instead of 4. When I used disks on my GDSF7 I found it really helpful. And ofcourse with 1.6MB formatted disks a 12 megabit (1.5 megabyte) game fits on 1 disk so a game like Mega Man X would be a single disk game instead of 2.

<br />
<br />how long does it hold save and can you copy your saves to floppy?

<br />It saves it until the AC adapter is unplugged.  Use the "Write BRAM" function (I think it was called) to write it to disk.

<br />
<br />I don't have a program currently available to do it but basically, take your Game Doctor format ROM, after the 512 byte header, go forward 12 megabits (1.5 megabytes) into the file. That 1.5 megabytes + 512 byte header is the first piece. Then go forward and take another 12 megabit chunk until you've got the entire file into 12 megabit pieces, the last piece may be less than 12 megabits. The Game Doctor will figure out how to load it, there is no reason at all to use 8 Megabit (1 megabyte) pieces.
