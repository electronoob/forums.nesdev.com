<div class="quotetitle">tepples wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"><br /><div class="quotetitle">Bregalad wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">Does the 2 dummy fetches at the end of each scanline always read the same adress as the actual fetch that was before it ?<br /></div><br />I think that's the key. The fetches at x=337 and x=339 of one line have the same address as the fetches at x=1 of the next line.<br /><br />Now we just need to figure out how to do the same thing with fewer I/Os. I'd bet just watching for several consecutive reads with bit 13 set ($2000-$3FFF) would do it. The most consecutive fetches you get from $2000-$3FFF during a scanline is two, and the end of a scanline has four: x=337, x=339, x=1, x=3.<br /></div><br /><br />Did some probing around with my logic analyzer to try and prove the validity of your idea Tepples.  It might be even easier that that, I'll have to test this at some point but it appears that a simple flipflop could sense scanlines if the timing was properly established.<br /><br />Watching the CHR A13 line you see the four consecutive reads like you discussed.  Below the blue trace is CHR A12 where you can see the sprite fetches for the scanline.  Yellow is CHR /RD, Red is CHR A13, and Green is CHR /WR (not much to see).  This is coming from the intro of "To the Earth" for anyone curious.<br /><br /><img src="https://dl.dropbox.com/u/18341918/B_ca12%20Y_chrRD%20R_ca13.jpg" alt="Image" /><br /><br />But looking at the traces above one other thing sticks out.  CHR A13 and CHR /RD always rise WITH eachother, but there's ONE exception.  Between scanlines CHR A13 falls low for a small period of time, and when it rises again for the 3rd read CHR /RD has 'hung' for that same period of time.  So it almost looks like you could just have a counter that was allowed to be clocked when CHR /RD was high and then clocked with CHR A13.  This looks like a great solution with the above discrete traces.  In actuality CHR A13 lags CHR /RD slightly as expected, which wouldn't allow the idea above to work if the logic was reasonably fast.  One way to get around that would be to add some extra delay to CHR /RD with a few gates or something.  I wouldn't expect this to be to stable, just thought it was interesting how CHR A13 toggling could be taken advantage of.<br /><br />Your idea to merely check for 4 consecutive writes seems pretty sound.  You could even reduce the counting logic from 3 to 2 bits and just check for 3 consecutive reads I'd think.  The IRQ's would be delayed compared to MMC3 but you'd loose the mess of goofing things up with $2006/7 only using TWO inputs.

Yes, the thread I didn't think it was serious was the "OMG I invented the MMC7" one, not <em>this</em> thread.<br /><br />I guess I'd had to say "I didn't think <strong><em>that</em></strong> thread ..." instead of "<strong>this</strong> thread" to be more precise - in french (my language) we only have a single word for "this" and "that" so it's hard for me to know which one to pick when I'm writing in english.<br /><br />When it comes to deteting the end of the frame, wouldn't it be as simple as counting 240 scanlines ? Of course it you enable rendering late (Battletoads style) it will not work, but who ever said the MMC5 counter worked properly in this setting ?<br /><br />Detecting reads from $fffa can be clever, but it will only work if NMI is enabled. We all agree it's almost always the case, but you could decide for some reason not to always use NMIs, and then this would make the MMC5 counter fail as well ?<br /><br />I think there is at least a NROM game, Portopia, which relies entirely on $2002 pooling and never uses NMI. This game hardly uses any animations so randomly missing VBlanks has no visible effects on the game.<br /><br />Anyways this should be extremely simple to test by reading $fffa manually. If the MMC5 however looks for a $fffa read followed by a $fffb read on the next cycle we can't do that with code so we'd have to test this by disabling NMIs and see if the counter still works or if it's stuck in its "in frame" state.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=38">Bregalad</a> — Sat Apr 21, 2012 2:15 am</p><hr />

Or did I just misinterpret what you wrote?<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">Bregalad wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"><br />Back on the subject about how MMC5 detects the VBlank/Frame, I don't know but I have some feeling that it's something dead simple nobody ever thought.<br />Like a particular fetch the PPU does at the beginning which simply enables the "frame" mode - which would be easy to replicate by reading $2007 during VBlank and trick the MMC5 into thinking the frame has begun.<br /></div><br /><br />I believe the prerender scanline makes the same triple-fetch that other scanlines do, so I'd hypothesize that the MMC5 looks for the first triple-fetch to see when the PPU starts rendering.<br /><br />The only other way to triple-fetch an address (aside from how the PPU naturally does it) is to do it intentionally, by writing the same address to 2006 three times (reading from 2007 each time), so it seems plausible to me. It'd even be easy to implement the in-frame flag this way; whenever the scanline counter is clocked, set the in-frame flag.<br /><br />That's how it could detect the <em>start</em> of a frame, but how it detects the <em>end</em> of a frame is beyond me. Krzysiobal's earlier post mentioned that he watches for a read from CPU$FFFA, which would happen when the vblank NMI happens. Right now, I'd be most willing to wager on that being how the MMC5 does it. <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" /><br /><br />This is all just speculation though.

Hello again!<br />Thanks for reply - the problem was solved!<br />It was indeed connected with the IRQs.<br /><br />Hovewer, it really does not matter if the irq is fired late a scanline, a dot or something (the banks will be switched one scanline too late, but that won't be quite vissible).<br /><br />I have examined in details what castlevania 3 does in the title screen:<br /><br /><br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent"><br />nmi:<br />    ...<br />    lda $5204     ;acknowledge irq<br />    lda #$80<br />    sta $5204     ;turn irqs on<br />    lda #8<br />    sta $5203     ;set irq to be fired at scanline 8<br />    ...<br />    rti<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />irq:<br />    ...<br />    lda $5204      ;acknowldge IRQ<br />    lda bank       ;check if current chr-bank is 1 or 0<br />    beq scanline_8<br />    bne scanline_d0<br />    <br />scanline_8:<br />    lda #1     <br />    sta $512b    ;switch bank<br />    sta bank<br /><br />    lda #$D0   <br />    sta $5203    ;set irq to be fired on $d0 scanline<br />    jmp irq_end<br />    <br />scanline_d0:<br />    lda #0<br />    sta $512b    ;switch bank<br />    sta bank<br />    lda #$D3     ;set irq to be fired on $d3 scanline - don't know why, but the irqs are turned off so maybe it even is ignored by the cpu<br />    sta $5203<br />    lda #0       ;turn off irqs<br />    sta $5204<br />irq_end:<br />    ...<br />    rti<br /><br /></div><br /><br /><a href="http://obrazki.elektroda.net/8_1334695744.png" class="postlink"><img src="http://obrazki.elektroda.net/8_1334695744_thumb.png" alt="Image" /></a> <br /><br />So it turns the IRQ to be fired at scanline 8 (it is constant) - when you look at the screen in PAL mode, you see glitches above that scanline. In NTSC it is invissible. Because PEGASUS it is an NTSC console with forced PAL (probably the same as russian DENDY), it can be seen on my tv <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />Nevermind, after that it changes CHR bank.<br />The next IRQ is set to be fired at scanline $D0 (this is variable - as the title screen advances, this value is decreased (the next IRQ is fired more and more early). After that, the second CHR bank switch takes place.<br /><br />I am writing my dev-cart in VHDL and have two separate processess (one which is responsible for the CPU part and one for the PPU).<br /><br />And I have also such signals as mmc5_ppu_in_frame, mmc5_irq_pending, and some others (no matter).<br /><br />Hovewer, becase those two signals need to be changed by both of the processes:<br /><br />mmc5_irq_pending must be cleared after $5204 read - the "CPU" process is doing that, but it also must be set after PPU notices that the current scanline number matches the one at $ 5203 - the "PPU" process is doing that.<br /><br />Similar with the second signal.<br /><br />Because one signal cannot be driven by the two processes, I had to make some `trick` - I added some more signals:<br />mmc5_irq_pending_set_req (set request)<br />mmc5_irq_pending_set_ack (set acknowledge)<br />So the the CPU is driving the irq_pending signal as it wants, but when the PPU wants to set it high, it sets mmc5_irq_pending_seet_req to '1';<br /><br />When the CPU notices that mmc5_irq_pending_set_req equals '1', it<br />sets mmc5_irq_pending to '1' and sets mmc5_irq_pending_set_ack to '1'.<br /><br />When the PPU notices that the mmc5_irq_pending_set_ack is '1', it clears<br />mmc5_irq_pending_set_req to '0'.<br />And when the CPU notices that the mmc5_irq_pending_set_req is '0', it clears the mmc5_irq_pending_set_ack to '0';<br /><br />So it is some kind of handshake <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br />The CPU_PROCESS is activated on rising edge on M2.<br />The PPU_PROCESS is activated on falling edge on PPU_!RD or falling edge on PPU_!WR.<br /><br />However, before it started to work it was a little bit exchanged - the PPU process was driving the mmc5_irq_pending signal and the CPU process was setting mmc5_irq_pending_clear_req if it wanted to pull it down.<br />And it didn't worked as good because the PPU process is not active during VBLANK because PPU_!RD and PPU_!WR is high there! So if the CPU wanted to pull it low during VBLANK, it was pulled low by the PPU_PROCESS but after the VBLANK.<br /><br />The CPU PROCESS is active all the time (the M2 is changing low to high all the time)<br /><br />So it was my ingenious idea to change the roles <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br />Sorry for such long description, thought someone might need it in the future.<br /><br />BTW. I love reading DISCH's notes about mappers, for example:<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent"> Detailed Operation:<br /> <br />    The IRQ counter is an up counter, rather than a down counter &#40;like MMC3&#41;.  Every time the MMC5 detects a<br /> scanline, it does the following:<br /> <br /> - If In Frame Signal is clear...<br />    a&#41; Set In Frame signal<br />    b&#41; Reset IRQ counter to 0<br />    c&#41; Clear IRQ pending flag &#40;automatically acknowledging IRQ&#41;<br /> <br /> - otherwise...<br />    a&#41; Increment IRQ counter<br />    b&#41; If IRQ counter now equals the trigger value, raise IRQ pending flag<br /></div><br />Such detailed and algorithmic approach makes no ambiguities and implementing that is just piece of cake!  This guy should be awarded a medal.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=4898">krzysiobal</a> — Tue Apr 17, 2012 2:08 pm</p><hr />

Your test using Laser vision might not be conclusive that your IRQ counter is working properly if it's not sensitive to being off a scanline or a few dots.  I would think it's probable that your on the right scanline but wrong dot.  If that's the case I would guess some games won't care, but others will which might be your issue.<br /><br />I'm not sure when the MMC5 fires an IRQ exactly but if you can't figure it out I can *try* to get a sample using my logic analyzer for CV3 on that screen.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=4832">infiniteneslives</a> — Mon Apr 16, 2012 7:08 am</p><hr />

Hello again!<br />I will describe it soon if you wish <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br />Yea, the black-square box inside is a Spartan XC3S200 FPGA, which emulates mappers. There are currently support for NROM, UNROM (UOROM), CNROM, BNROM, GNROM, ANROM, MMC1, MMC3, MMC5, CAMERICA (71 &amp; 232), JALECO (18). The FPGA utilization level is 62%.<br />PRG ROM 512KB, CHR ROM 512KB, PRG RAM 32KB, CHR RAM 32KB, support for 4mirroring. Games are loaded from MMC card - full fat16 implementation for 6502 from scratch ;]<br /><br />The design is ready for PRG ROM chips up to 4MB, but I've never found such large FLASH ROMS (I'm using 29F040 which is 512KB. 29F080 is 1MB, but it is rare).<br />4 x 29F040 can be connected in parallel with LS319 decoding, but there will be too many wires and too many noise.<br /><br />However, I need to ask for some help! I implemented MMC5  (it is almost complete, with all features except the vertical split).<br />I tested the features on home-made mmc5 test roms (for example - the extended tile/attributes, extra nametable) and it works OK.<br /><br />The one game that I am focused on is Castlevania 3. It works really great except one minor flaw in the intro. Few days ago I thought it's because some mistakes in assigning banks, but checked everything 3 times and seems to be ok.<br /><br />I thought also that's because it might use extended tile/attributes, extra nametable but now it is implemented and it still flaws. As I guess, Castlevania does not use split scrolling - the only STA $5200 opcode (hexadecimally 8D0052) is at $3E100 offset in the NES file and it's a part of such routine:<br /><br /><img src="http://obrazki.elektroda.net/59_1334568978.png" alt="Image" /> <br /><br />so storing #00 here definitely turns off the splitting.<br />Also checked for any STXes and STYes at this address and none was found.<br /><br />It is the video how it looks on my cart.. (for those impatients - it's at 1:30)<br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://youtu.be/OrYAC_1bNSk">http://youtu.be/OrYAC_1bNSk</a><!-- m --><br /><br />See that the title screen is correct for a second, then something get switched and it breaks.<br /><br />Inspecting how it plays at the FCEUX emulator and taking look at the nametables and pattern tables I see exactly the same behaviour (in the name table's window), but in the game window everything is ok of  course.<br /><br />Click on the image for enlargement.<br /><br />That's just a second before the fatal switch:<br /><br /><a href="http://obrazki.elektroda.net/65_1334569394.png" class="postlink"><img src="http://obrazki.elektroda.net/65_1334569394_thumb.png" alt="Image" /></a> <br /><br />and that's after:<br /><br /><a href="http://obrazki.elektroda.net/53_1334569225.png" class="postlink"><img src="http://obrazki.elektroda.net/53_1334569225_thumb.png" alt="Image" /></a> <br /><br />When I played it in nesticle, it behaved the same way like on my dev-cart!<br /><br />Strange thing is that at the second screen, the big Castle Vania text is displayed correctly in the game window, but there aren't any pattern tables for it!<br /><br />Very similar behaviour can be seen in the MMC3 game - Doki Doki Yuuenchi (Doki Doki Amusement Park):<br /><br /><a href="http://obrazki.elektroda.net/90_1334569584.png" class="postlink"><img src="http://obrazki.elektroda.net/90_1334569584_thumb.png" alt="Image" /></a> <br /><br />The scrollbar with START/PASSWORD text is buggy in name table window and there aren't any fonts in pattern tables!<br />However, it is working because this game uses IRQ counter - it sets the irq counter at the scanline just before the START/PASSWORD text and when it is fired, it quickly swapps the chr banks so that the text is rendered using different pattern tables.<br />But this game runs correctly on my dev-cart!<br /><br />Similar actions might be used in the CastleVania 3, but I also implemented IRQ counter in MMC5 and it seems to work correctly (tested it for example on the Laser Invasion MMC5 game - and when the IRQ counter was not implemented, ths game glitched  and blinked).
