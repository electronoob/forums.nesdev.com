<br />
<br />A. Sprite x Sprite collision = you could keep track of their X,Y positions in RAM 200-2FF as example. Once X1 = X2 and Y1 = Y2 (in a latency of S pixels, where S is the size of your desired sprite), you got a strike and triggers the event.
<br />
<br />B. Sprite x Background collision = even if you use sprite #0 hits to detect solid background pixel, it's useless most of times. This way, you must read the nametable (a tile in X,Y position) and compares with the sprite - it would had attributes (as solid, air, spikes...). Another RAM region would get the things working good.
<br />
<br />I'm sorry, try ASM code by yourself. Get the idea and test it.

I have an idea to tell it when the object moving is in tile #99, it will disable the RIGHTKEYdown function. But I don't know how to define a variable in RAM for a tile #, because you can only say something like this:
<br />
<br />Something = $80
<br />
<br />you couldn't say this:
<br />
<br />Something = #80
<br />
<br />You can only define variables with hex crap, you can't do it with decimal, and that sucks! I think I'm using a crappy assembler, though, I'm using Nesasm, and I heard that sucks. I'm probably not making sense, so I'm gonna stop babling now.

<br />I know that that isn't correct by the way. I don't know how to get it to stop when it's at location 99,100 if 100 is Y and 99 is X.

<br />
<br />I'd say that collision detection is one of the trickier things to code.  At least for for sprite-to-bg.  Sprite-to-sprite is easier and a good place to start, since the sprites are on the same coordinate system to begin with.
<br />
<br />What you need to do to use bounding boxes like tepples said, is to do some range checking.  This probably isn't an ideal example, but here's how I do this in Munchie Attack.
<br />
<br />notes:
<br />player's "mouth" sprite starts at $204
<br />food objects start at $240
<br />the @itsblank label is where it goes for 'no hit'.
<br />the BCC/BCS branch after CMP is used to do greater/less than checking.  For example, food objects are coming from the right, so the food's coordinate has to be less than the player's right edge, and greater than the player's left edge to count as a hit.
<br />The values added and subtraced change the size of the box.
<br />
<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">hit_detection:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ldx #0<br />@hitloop:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; lda $241,x<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; sta tiletype<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; bne :+<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; jmp @itsblank<br />:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; lda $243,x<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; sec<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; sbc #8<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; cmp $207<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; bcc :+<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; jmp @itsblank<br />:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; clc<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; adc #24<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; cmp $207<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; bcs :+<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; jmp @itsblank<br />:<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; lda $240,x<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; sec<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; sbc #15<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; cmp $204<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; bcc :+<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; jmp @itsblank<br />:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; clc<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; adc #30<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; cmp $204<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; bcs :+<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; jmp @itsblank<br />:<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; lda #0&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ; if it makes it all the way here, it was hit<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; sta $241,x<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; sta $245,x<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; sta $249,x<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; sta $24D,x<br /></div>

<br />
<br />   if (y_diff &lt; 0)
<br />      y_diff = -y_diff;

<br />Yeah.  You need to change the branch condition and/or destination of the first check.  What comes to mind for me is this:

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Oh man, you should have seen the code for a PC sidescroller I tried to write when I was first learning C. I used fractional values for the player position and I think my "move until hit obstacle" tried every single sub-pixel position. A later version found the intercept of the movement vector. Still all major overkill; this wasn't a physics simulation that required absolute accuracy.
<br />
<br />Draw a picture and think about the minimum work necessary to find if movement is possible, and how far. Then find simplifications that don't add much more work than the minimum. Be sure to abstract the problem to only the essential details.
<br />
<br />Also, find a way to enjoy experimenting with 6502 programming techniques. It really helps to write simple debugging output routines to print a byte (or find an emulator with a good debugger), so you can write short test code and see the results.

As blargg suggests, you should try to abstract this problem so that it is more general.  This abstracted version (often called a "engine") should allow you design levels using the concept of objects, as opposed to pixels.  The key is to get the level of abstraction right.  The more abstract it is the more general your engine is, but it also becomes more difficult to implement it.  You want it abstract enough that it simplifies your design, but not so abstract that it does more than you need.
