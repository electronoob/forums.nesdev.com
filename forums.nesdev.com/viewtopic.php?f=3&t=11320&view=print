		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />What's also confusing is that the screenshots shown are for FCEUX and (presumably) Nestopia, yet I don't see how No Sprite Limit could cause what's being shown (unless someone isn't initialising OAM correctly before power-on, thus some sprites and BG tiles are fighting over priority and the result is a busted title screen).<br /><br />Furthermore, look at the gobbledegook at the bottom of the screen in FCEUX -- is that normal?  Does it happen on an actual Famicom/NES?  If not, then I'd classify that as a bug in FCEUX.  So really what are we talking about here?  :P<br /><br />My guess is that the game is has very sensitive PPU timing or if it's a hacked version of some game then I wouldn't be surprised if someone broke it (I've done this myself!).  How/why No Sprite Limit plays a role here is unknown.  And <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/viewtopic.php?t=8360" class="postlink">I've already discussed elsewhere</a> how turning on No Sprite Limit can have &quot;unexpected&quot; effects on a game.<br /><br />Finally, while it's good to get some information out there, it's also important to know that this forum isn't for Nestopia support.  In fact, there is no real support for the original Nestopia at this present time (the author appears to have gone MIA for many years now).  There is <a href="http://www.emucr.com/2014/05/nestopia-git-20140509.html" class="postlink">an unofficial Nestopia version</a> being maintained by some dude(s), so maybe you should try that and reach out and <a href="https://github.com/rdanbrook/nestopia" class="postlink">talk to them</a>?

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Actually one problem is that I found your post a bit difficult to decipher. Judging from the fact you used QQ to take screenshots I guess you're Chinese, right? In that case you may post in the <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/viewforum.php?f=18" class="postlink">Chinese forum</a> instead so that someone (like me) can understand you.<br /><br />I can just guess, was that you're saying that when using Nestopia, you must turn off &quot;Sprite Limit&quot;, otherwise there will be missing texts in the menu, right?<br /><br />As you mentioned that you didn't have the real cart to check, maybe the ROM has the same problem on a real system?<br /><br />One thing, is that Nestopia is commonly regarded as a much more accurate emulator than FCEUX, you cannot immediate deduce from Nestopia's output that it's incorrect, though there certainly may be specific edge cases that FCEUX emulates a game correctly while Nestopia doesn't.<br /><br />Moreover, since this game is a <s>pirate</s> hacked ROM, or even a HKO game (being from Hong Kong I don't like to use this term, but aw well...) it is possible that it uses a special mapper that Nestopia doesn't support fully, or even, it's programmed poorly that it indeed has problems when executed by a real system.<br /><br />Worst of all, the hackers who created this ROM had only tested it with an (inaccurate) emulator and didn't know that it didn't even work on the real system(there are a lot of such ROMs).

I didn't quite notice the shape of the gobbledegook (due to the palette (dark purple on black is a bit hard to see when posting late at night :-) )), but yeah they're controllers.  Thanks for pointing that out tokumaru!

A summary will follow.<br /><br />It appears to work in FCEUX because it is not very accurate. The ROM looks to be hacked together, and is doing something wrong in setting up its name table. The missing text is (likely) not sprites, so it is not because of the sprite limit. Probably on real hardware it will have the same problem as NEStopia is generally well put together.
