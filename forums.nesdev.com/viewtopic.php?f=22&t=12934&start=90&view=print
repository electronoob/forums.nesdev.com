Some instructions on how to gain the enemies power and how to use it would be nice.<br /><br />- Sometimes when I read those signs, the screen it took me to had messed up graphics on them. FYI, I'm playing on real hardware with N-8 Everdrive. <br /><br />- I really liked those arrow puzzle mechanics. <br /><br />- I don't think I ever learned how to use that Pizza thing in the menu. <br /><br />- I swear that there were some platforms where I could manually drop down from them and then others which looked identical which I couldn't. <br /><br />- The check point could be a little more fancier. Yes, that single star is okay, but I often confuse it with an enemy or something else. If it had a big letter C or S or something else then it might be more obvious what it is.  <br /><br />When you do beta testing let me know.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Okay, so I downloaded the latest rom demo that you posted and did another playthrough. <br /><br /><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cIRXGjpb8eY" class="postlink">Video of updated Nova</a><br /><br />Some notes:<br /><br />- I can confirm that on the read me signs cut scenes that the graphics are still glitched<br /><br />- I like how weapons sometimes have different abilities such as pressing up and down to get different effects<br /><br />- It's actually a very interesting game. Lots of puzzle elements and interesting mechanics such as turning into a block as if it were a literal level editor. <br /><br />- When I get colored keys, does it ever show on screen what keys I have?<br /><br />- The sound that the character makes when she hits her head on the ceiling sounds like she is getting hurt and sometimes I think I'm getting hurt when really its just me hitting my head on something. Maybe use a different sound effect for that. <br /><br />- In the menu sometimes its hard to scroll down the whole inventory list to get something. Maybe if you made it scroll if you hold down on the D-pad or something so that you can scroll quicker down the list. <br /><br />- I ran across one thing that I think makes no sense. When you are first shown the pushable block mechanic, you then push a block off a ledge and then it falls and lands on something and then you use that as a platform to progress. But when the character falls down in the same spot, she just dies. So what did the pushable block land on is the million dollar question???

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Thank you for playing the updated ROM. I'll watch the video soon (almost two hours and only the first two worlds? I have a feeling that the people that are planning on streaming the entire game when  it's completed are ready to sit down for a long time, haha).<br /><br />I guess I'll play through the game on PowerPak and see what I can reproduce, as far as glitched dialog graphics go. Proooobably not a good idea to do most of my testing in FCEUX.<br /><br />Keys actually go into your inventory, so you'll see entries for &quot;red key&quot;, &quot;green key&quot; etc. I don't think I can really display them on the status since the sprite colors are different from the background colors. (Unless I had like, an &quot;R&quot;, &quot;G&quot;, &quot;B&quot; in place of actual colored keys? Or use the digits that are already in sprite CHR? &quot;1&quot;, &quot;2&quot;, &quot;3&quot;? In any case it's on the inventory screen.)<br /><br />I will add auto-repeat on the inventory screen. One thing you can do is use Select to swap the positions of two things, Pokemon-style. Once upon a time I thought about having some key combination automatically use the item at the top of the inventory, but usually there's multiple items you want anyway.<br /><br />The bump sound is the same one as in my earlier Sliding Blaster game I think? But I can mess with that. It honestly should not play as often as it does.<br /><br />I have it where pushable blocks are stopped by anything that isn't air (whether or not it's solid), OR the bottom of the level. I can put a background tile down there for the block to be pushed onto, no problem.<br /><br /><img src="https://i.imgur.com/31AWZXo.png" alt="Image" />

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I got around to watching the second video (still haven't watched the first) and made lots of little subtle level changes as I went along. Some thoughts:<br /><br />The block placing mechanic was inspired by <a href="https://youtu.be/hjDyleelyzs?t=697" class="postlink">Donkey Kong for Game Boy</a>, and I was surprised to see that <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/viewtopic.php?f=33&amp;t=17008" class="postlink">Gruniożerca 2</a> has it too, as its main mechanic. I feel like maybe the puzzle of figuring out where to place them might be too hard? But at the same time I want it to be an actual puzzle. I should probably have puzzle solutions available online for the final game.<br /><br />I don't really make enough of a distinction between the &quot;barrier&quot; arrows and the arrows that just indicate that the top/bottom edge of the screen is linked. I don't really have spare CHR though, and I already feel like I have way too many mechanics to explain. I think this game will reaaaaally benefit from a manual that just has like, a list of everything in picture-form. It could also have a list of all of the copyable enemies and the abilities you get from them.<br /><br />I noticed none of my cutscenes got played because I wasn't clear enough about how you can move up with the cursor and choose to watch them, maybe I should have the cursor start up there and have you move down, or I should move it down so it looks like a menu option. Probably a good thing though because my plot is super convoluted and silly, but at the same time I wanted to have it.<br /><br />I think I need to actually replace the per-level inventory thing with something that's actually labeled as a per-level stock that's shown <em>alongside</em> your inventory? And things like keys could go into there, and that would completely avoid the problem where you can't pick up keys because you have too much stuff.<br /><br />Dialog graphics are <em>not</em> glitched on the PowerPak at all, so I think maybe the Everdrive messes up OAM somehow? It would help if someone else who has an Everdrive could try and verify that?<br /><br />I think I miiiiiight have put a little too much of a requirement on being familiar with Chip's Challenge, with 2-5 requiring you to know to collect all the chips and with some of 2-6's gameplay. I do put a sign at the start of 2-5 but a lot of signs get skipped, so that'd be better in the pre-level text. On that note, maybe I need to replace the tutorial map entirely with a more direct tutorial like Kirby Super Star has. I think it'd also be cool if I could make text appear on the screen during gameplay with button hints though that'd be tricky. Unless I just make it so that text appears above you when you're standing in a certain area?<br /><br />I'm surprised you barely ever use springs on 2-5. When I play through it I just use them a whole bunch because it's the easiest way to launch myself up.<br /><br />The video cuts out at almost the very start of 2-7 so if there was more after that I didn't see it.

It IS super long (33 levels and 7 bosses planned, though that's in comparison to SMB3's 90 levels), though if you know what you're doing I imagine you could run through it in like 45 minutes.

I know a lot of arcade style games have a screen that displays all the elements and what they do, too.
