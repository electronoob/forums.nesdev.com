As developer, you wouldn't create a game without CHR ROM, since the board offers a complex bankswitching system to improve graphics.<br />3. As emulator author, I've created a check for CHR ROM to this mapper. Dirty headers might bring the wrong mapper number. In other words, if a game is marked mapper 5 and has no CHR ROM, the emulator halts the loading.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Well, using CHR-RAM in place of CHR-ROM in any mapper with CHR bankswitching more or less presupposes the emulator iNES 2 support, except for 1 or 2 special cases of mappers previously known to have 32k CHR-RAM. Otherwise there's no way to specify how much CHR-RAM you need.<br /><br />I think you'll find a lot of older emulators will not do CHR-RAM for arbitrary mappers, even the &quot;0 CHR-ROM = normally assume 8k CHR-RAM&quot; iNES 1 level support is pretty spotty from what I've seen.<br /><br />If the emulator supports iNES 2 it really probably should let you do it for all mappers.

Where once was ROM is now RAM.<br /><br />Even in the Napoleon Senki mapper, I would think that the original implied CHR-RAM would remain in place and an iNES 2 specified CHR-RAM would replace the previous CHR-ROM portion.<br /><a href="https://wiki.nesdev.com/w/index.php/INES_Mapper_077" class="postlink">https://wiki.nesdev.com/w/index.php/INES_Mapper_077</a>

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I don't know about Lagrange Point specifically, but there are a few things you can do with bankswitched RAM even if there's only 8KB of it. Changing the order in which tiles are mapped in the PPU address space makes background animations possible without the need for name table changes, just like with CHR-ROM, but with the disadvantage of reducing the amount of unique tiles you can have on screen. You can double buffer background pattern animations that take longer than a vblank to update, and only switch the graphics when all tiles are ready. You can also make the same set of tiles available on both pattern tables, for objects that can be displayed both as background and as sprites (e.g. collectible items), which, if animated, will only need to be changed once.
