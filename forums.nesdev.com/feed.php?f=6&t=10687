I spent too much time worrying about how to to it the right way such that I completely dropped it. Bleh.<br /><br />Anyway, I just cribbed Kasumi's animation code and stuck it in mine, so you can have an animated cursor but no transition animations. I added the ability to move the sprite at the same time as the tile changes.<br /><br />If you want to use an 8x16 sprite, you can enable that too-- I added a comment about it, just search for &quot;8x16&quot;. (Be careful: if you do, the tile numbers get a little weird. Even numbers are from first half of the tiles, odd from the last half.)<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3512">lidnariq</a> — Sun Nov 17, 2013 3:44 pm</p><hr />

I will probably be building some frames to make the curser look like its rotating or bouncing (all within the 8x8 tile of course.)

My preference would be to have the cursers on there own chr page, cause I want as many tiles as I can manage for my back ground graphics.

Here's one that allows you to customize the cursor animation. To change the animation, set the length with NumberOfFrames, then add/subtract bytes from cursoranimation as needed. All frames will show up for the same amount of time (CursorDelay). If you want variable delays, find the least common multiple of the delays you want and double up tiles as needed.<br /><br />That's about as far as I go, unless I broke it again somehow. The more things you want, the harder it is to make customizable anyhow.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3504">Kasumi</a> — Fri Nov 15, 2013 8:00 pm</p><hr />
