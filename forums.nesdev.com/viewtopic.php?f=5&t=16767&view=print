Been using it about a week now, no freeze ups or anything.<br /><br />It's not malware causing my chrome issue.

I used to use the Keybinder extension to remap Ctrl+Q, but this no longer works as of Firefox 57 because WebExtensions can't remap keys unless and until <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1325692" class="postlink">bug 1325692</a> becomes fixed.<br /><br />The solution that worked for me was to enter <tt style="margin-left: 2px; margin-right: 2px; padding:3px; background-color: #3355aa; color: white;">about&#058;config</tt> in the location bar, press Enter, click past the &quot;This might void your warranty&quot; warning, and set both of these to true:<br /><br /><ul><li><tt style="margin-left: 2px; margin-right: 2px; padding:3px; background-color: #3355aa; color: white;">browser.showQuitWarning</tt> </li><li><tt style="margin-left: 2px; margin-right: 2px; padding:3px; background-color: #3355aa; color: white;">browser.warnOnQuit</tt></li></ul>

	<tr>
		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I've been back and forth between Firefox and Chrome over the years. I've always had both installed (for a few reasons), but I had been using Chrome for about the last two years I think because at one point Firefox wasn't recognizing my GPU for hardware acceleration. This was eventually fixed, but it was the reason I switched at the time.<br /><br />Anyhow, when the new version of Firefox came out I was happy to give it another try, and I like it a whole lot. It definitely uses a lot less memory, and less CPU. At the same time, it has a very customizable interface, compared to Chrome which has almost no customization at all, aside from plugins.<br /><br />My favourite feature is that the font menu has an option to disable custom fonts on webpages. I <em>hate</em> all the random fonts people use to display webpages (I came here to read), especially because almost none render properly without font anti-aliasing, which I always have turned off. With Chrome there was a &quot;font blocker&quot; plugin which inconveniently let me block /some/ of them on a per-website basis one at a time, but Firefox has the nuclear option I wanted built right in and efficient. It's wonderful.<br /><br />At the same time I switched from using Adblock Plus to Ublock Origin. I'd been using ABP for years and never really thought much about it, but apparently it had kinda gone to seed a while back... with the new Firefox there were horrible performance issues until I disabled it (took a little bit of experimentation to figure this out). I don't know if this was a temporary problem that has been fixed, but it doesn't matter because I switched to Ublock Origin which works perfectly fine and does the same thing (maybe better).<br /><br />One thing I am missing from Chrome is the easy user profiles switch in the top right. In Chrome I can create multiple user profiles, and just click an icon in the top right to switch between them. Very slick. I use this a lot for things like, e.g. the official twitter account for my game, it's much easier to just switch profiles instead of logging out and into twitter. In Firefox this kind of capability is a bit hidden by default. It exists, but it's buried under some command line options (still not sure what <em>-no-remote</em> means) but after a bit of fussing I have gotten it to work okay. Switching is not as easy as in Chrome (had to create separate desktop shortcuts with some command line options) but it at least works.<br /><br />Another thing I'm missing a little from Chrome is its integrated translator. Again there's a substitute, but it's not quite as easy in Firefox. Currently using the S3.Translator plugin, which works okay, but Chrome's had some really nice options/UI for it, IMO.<br /><br />There's some good plugins on Firefox for downloading streaming videos from places like YouTube (see: Video DownloadHelper) that never had a Chrome version. I find that pretty useful, like if I want to use a clip from something, make a GIF, etc. I can just grab the video directly. Chrome never had a good plugin for that. That's actually a big reason I always kept Firefox installed.<br /><br />Anyhow, I'm back on the Firefox and I love it.<br /><br /><br />Honourable mention: I also tried Opera for a bit when I was experimenting. It was mostly pretty good, but just has a lot less features than either Firefox or Chrome, and performance is comparable anyway. I wouldn't really consider it because: lack of user profiles, lack of available plugins (esp. none for font blocking), and also I hit the GPU hardware acceleration problem with it.

For Vista+ machines I go directly to Pale Moon instead of Firefox, greater performance and much more customizability out the box.

Updates to the browser won't help you when the operating system itself is vulnerable. Or have you been using the POSReady hack?</div><br /><br />Good hygiene goes a long way. Good HOSTS file is a necessity (regardless of OS), turning off/removing/reconfiguring services, not going to shady places (a good HOSTS file aready won't let you for the most part) and definitely not running all the software you can find can do wonders. Then you can think of stuff like anti malware software and/or use any of the online file scanners to make sure what you get is most probably clean. I don't even have any realtime protections (mostly due to their severe performance implications) but I do offline (involves removal of storage medium(s)) scans with another machine every once in a while to make sure there isn't anything weird going on and last time I had a virus or anything else harmful was at a time when Windows 98SE and ME were still widely used and Windows Vista was going through its growing pains. Stuff like Wannacry and the like wouldn't have been able to remotely infect any of my computers in my home environment (but if I took one of my laptops out there could be a chance of infection).<br />POSready hack is useful too but by no means a necessity. As far as new Windowses go, I wouldn't even want the updates to happen as more often than not something breaks as a result. I repair computers as a living and each time there's some update on win10 there's a tidalwave of problem machines coming at my way. Then come more updates to fix the previous updates and more stuff breaks... (and there's a conflict of interest, updates break stuff and make me money, but they tend to cause inconveniences to the clients and I am paid to get rid of any inconveniences). I know that some government organizations over here have forcefully disabled windows updates because of all the problems they tend to cause initially, only after it is certain that things are finally ok there will be manual installs of updates deemed necessary. There seems to be no proper testing done anymore (and apparently real humans based testing staff was fired for the most part not very long ago).
