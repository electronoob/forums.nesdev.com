I checked with an oscope/volt meter.  All the registers don't appear to be starting as set like I told them to.  I didn't have time to look much deeper.  I doubt it's much of an issue, I'll have to dig in more tonight to find out what's going on with the start up values.  There are a few ways that are supposed to allow you to command how the registers to start up set/clear.  I'll try the other methods and see what happens.  Might have to make a few simple experiments.<br /><br />Good to hear its alive and running in an emu already!

Apparently Xilinx webpack likes to completely ignore the 'design goals and strategy' and requires the setting to be set individually for each step of the process.  The compiler report revealed it's ignorance, I'm just glad I figured this out now.  Should help out with power and speed/area goals as well.<br /><br />Anyways, I checked it out and it still wasn't working (just blue screen) although things weren't always jammed up according to the old oscope.  I did realize why I got mixed up between mode 2 and 3 yesterday... I didn't read the wiki close enough and actually coded modes 2 &amp; 3 backwards. <br /><br />I fixed the mix up but am still am only getting blue screen though.  I'm guessing the issue is on my end somewhere though.  Because I swaped up the reg select values 1&lt;-&gt;3 so it should play a 256KB UOROM game upon start up (all my bits startup with a 1) when configured that way and it's not working...  I think I just found another bug though.  I now get randomly colored screens with paperboy 2 sitting in the board and register select values mixed up for testing/debugging.  Exciting to see something besides blue <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />Based on all that looks like I'm still having issues somewhere.  I'll have to comb through my code tomorrow and see if I can find anything else.  A little to tired for that at the moment...  If I don't see anything I'll just slowly hard code things into UOROM until it starts working then step my way back to the intended design.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />So I've managed to get two different error screens I'm kinda at a loss right now.  Randomly at power up I'll either get blue screen, error last prg bank not at $C000, or bus conflict error.<br /><br />I'm pretty sure I'm avoiding bus conflicts...  How are you sensing this exactly?<br /><br />My CPLD is starting with the last bank in the proper location, but based on scope traces I've got something over writing that making it so the last bank isn't there anymore once it's time to access it is my guess.<br /><br />Could you share the source or step through how it initializes the mapper and makes it's decisions on errors? (EDIT: forgot it was on the wiki vice download...) (EDIT2: I guess the wiki doesn't have the source I'm interested in seeing) I can keep chipping away at it but not being 100% certain the issue is with my mapper I don't know how much value there is trying to debug further from my end.<br /><br />I have found a few things that were wrong though, so my implementation has been far from bug free.  I'm guessing the issue is still from my end, but I'm having a hard time figuring out where to look without having a 'golden' reference yet...

INL may have swapped modes 2 and 3; the intent was to have them ordered like MMC1.<br /><br />I originally intended for the outer bank size to be ignored for addresses within the fixed bank. From the wiki description:<br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">When the fixed bank ($8000-$BFFF in mode 2 or $C000-$FFFF in mode 3) is accessed, it treats accesses to the fixed bank the same way as accesses in mode 0 with 32K: the outer bank bits are passed straight through. For example, this would allow the fixed $C000 bank in mode 3 128K to be set to 16K bank 7 (as in mapper 2) or 1, 3, or 5. In mode 2 128K, the fixed $8000 bank could be configured as 16K bank 0 (as in mapper 180) or 2, 4, or 6.</div><br />With the outer bank set to $2A, the 16K banks used by 32K mode are $54 and $55, and the top half of this is $55. More commonly for a ROM of his size, the outer bank would be set to $2F, which produces the expected UOROM-alike last bank in the fixed slot.

We're getting somewhere now though as the startup issues seem to be resolved. <br /><br />I just end up with blank black screen after reset which would seem to be expected.  I'm guessing this isn't handled in the code since my CPLD doesn't reset to last bank and everything as it does from power up.  Correct me if I'm wrong but the end goal is to have console reset only reset the current selected game vice resetting back to the multicart menu, right?  Without adding more circuitry/logic to the carts this is the only option really since I can only guarantee start up values of registers, and effectively can't sense reset.
