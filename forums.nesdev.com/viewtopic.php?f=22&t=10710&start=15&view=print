That being said, the diagonal lines actually make things look better! They prevent the floor from blending with the objects too much. The top one is the best IMO, because the more black you have on the floor the more it blends with the objects.

I don't like reading manuals, so I didn't come anywhere close to memorizing all the instructions given in the intro screens. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8FpigqfcvlM" class="postlink">You shouldn't have to study before playing a game</a>, that's boring. Then again, this game is somewhat more complex than any &quot;pick up and play&quot; games I can think of, so I'm not sure what the best approach to teach the player about your game would be. I'll give this a try again later, but I really dislike having to master all the controls for my very first time playing it just so I can do anything at all in the 30 seconds I have to buy/place furniture.
