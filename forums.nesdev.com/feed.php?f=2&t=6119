<div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"><br />Basically, this is my outline: <br />-Have 256KB of PRG, with 16 16KB banks. Last bank is fixed. <br />-Have 64 or maybe even 128KB of CHR ROM with 2KB swappable banks. 1KB would be cooler in terms of being able to animate some things, but probably too expensive. <br /><br />That'd be it. No extra RAM on the board or anything like that. This, to me, would be a nice step above UxROM in terms of CHR capabilities.

It also helps if your new board can be used by "pirates" because it ensures a bigger market for the board. If your board can only be used by developers of new games, that severely limits the amount you will be able to sell. If you make a MMC3 or perhaps even a FME7, you will sell alot more boards. Sure pirates will use it but you'll sell more boards, you'll see less people destroying original games, and you still make developers of new games capable of using a more advanced mapper without relying on limited numbers of original games to sacrifice. <br /><br />If BunnyBoy is making a MMC3 clone, seems like that would be the one to wait for, and if not that maybe he'll have FME7 or a MMC3-like board with less limits.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=1726">MottZilla</a> — Sat Mar 06, 2010 2:17 pm</p><hr />

Maybe the programmers at the time didn't know how the MMC3 worked properly so that's why they seems to have not gone by the book.. I wouldn't be surprised at all. <br /><br />We always get carried away on someone else topic <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" />  If we go back to the topic, I think an MMC3 clone, if the price is affordable, would cover the requirements that Sivak asked.  It got 8k prg bank switching, up to 256k of CHR-ROM, one pattern table is switchable 1k banks, the other one 2k.  Ram can added to it, which is a plus. <br /><br />I know you said 16k switchable banks but I would go against that. If someday you use any sample in your music, that will complicate things. That 8k fine grained selection seems a better option.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3559">Banshaku</a> — Fri Mar 05, 2010 7:30 pm</p><hr />

If actual effort was put into giving better tools to homebrew developers, there could easily be a better mapper than the MMC3 but still with a similar level of complexity.<br /><br />I guess I'm bitter about this because the scanline counter on the MMC3 doesn't play nice with things I got used to doing on the NES for every project I work on (using 8x16 sprites from the background pattern table), which renders it completely useless for me. The smaller PRG banks and mirroring control alone are not enough for me to want to use it (I'd rather stick to simple discrete logic mappers in this case), all I want is a decent scanline IRQ functionality that doesn't break under several common circumstances.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=95">tokumaru</a> — Fri Mar 05, 2010 6:49 pm</p><hr />

I can't do half of the stuff in that list. Hopefuly someone who's more hardware-inclined will feel like taking the challenge of implementing this mapper.<br /><br />I really like how this mapper uses CHR-RAM but has more than 8KB of it so that a certain level of bankswitching can be performed, it's a very good compromise between CHR-ROM and CHR-RAM.<br /><br />The simple yet effective IRQ is another feature that got me really interested. Although right now I'm kinda wondering how we'd go about using multiple IRQs in a single frame... One IRQ per frame would be no problem because you could simply disable IRQs after the first one fires, but what if you want another IRQ further down the screen? Would an IRQ fire for each scanline of the accessed tiles? Would it be possible to fire IRQs only for the first row of the special tiles?<br /><br />Also, like I said on the other thread: don't underestimate the PRG-ROM size, specially since it will have to hold all graphics as well. I feel like it has to support at least 1MB for it to be reasonably future-proof.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=95">tokumaru</a> — Fri Mar 05, 2010 6:26 pm</p><hr />

One thing you could try: Start with MMC1, such as the MMC1 clone from retrousb.com, and swap the CHR A12 and A11 lines going into the CHR ROM chip. Then register $A000 controls 2 KB banks in $0000 and $1000, and register $C000 controls 2 KB banks in $0800 and $1800.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=9">tepples</a> — Fri Mar 05, 2010 2:27 pm</p><hr />
