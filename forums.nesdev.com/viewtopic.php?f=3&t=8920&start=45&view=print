<br />My forum is at board.byuu.org, and anyone who wants to continue the discussion can do so there. Thanks!

<br />Seriously?
<br />
<br />So, let me get this straight: byuu gets upset that the discussion isn't going his way and decides he only wants to discuss it on his own turf.  Fine, whatever.  But locking the thread to prevent others from continuing the discussion accomplishes what, exactly?  Not a good precedent...

<br />
<br />Settle down, there's no conspiracy here.  If we want to continue discussing byuu's format here we can.  However, since byuu won't be participating, there's not much point.  If he wants to discuss it on his forums, that's his right.  If we want to complain and moan here with nobody listening, that's our right - just not very productive.
<br />
<br />The only sensible solution is to fork byuu's format and start our own <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />  /scarcasm
<br />
<br />Seriously, leave the guy alone.  He's drawn a line in the sand for his emulator and said he'll only support this new format.  Who cares?  He's done it deliberately, and with full knowledge of the landscape of the NES scene and the repercussions of that decision.  He's not asking anyone else to use it, and isn't proposing it as a replacement for iNES.  Let's turn our attention to more important things.

<br />If byuu weren't providing a converter from iNES (1 and 2), he'd be asking other people to release their ROMs in his format. But as long as he provides a converter, we can consider this an "intermediate representation", an implementation detail of the emulator, just as GBA and DS games need to be "converted" to run on certain flash adapters.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />It's pretty easy these days to deliver an emulator-specific rom format if one felt that the legacy standard was holding back compatibility gaurantees. A set of 2300 files uploaded to numerous hosting sites and linked to on several forums would eventually show up on filesearch engines and google. You can't convert a bad or missing header into a working file, any sort of tool would take significantly longer and be less reliable than finding one of these links where the conversion work has been done for you.
