<br />Back to the 3-sprite-wide hero: do you plan to have enemies to fight?  You mentioned that your game was going to be a platformer with puzzle elements.  Is your focus more on action or more on puzzles?   Having a wide hero makes me think about sprite flicker issues.  Especially if the hero has a ranged attack.  I'm just curious to know how you plan to deal with the 8-sprite limit.
<br />
<br />Not dogging the idea at all, btw.  I love your hero sprite, and my favorite NES game has an enemy that's 9-sprites wide (=automatic flicker).  Just want to hear your ideas.

<br />I think that games with big hero characters are great, even if they flicker a bit more than the ones with tiny heroes. When you look at <em>Batman Return of The Joker</em> you can't deny that it looks awesome, and I at least will take the flickering that comes with it any day. Even sprites that aren't exactly big can use a lot of sprites some times... Mega Man, for example, has animation frames with 4 tiles across, plus the one with his face, which adds up to over half of the sprite limit. His shooting frame appears to be like that, add the 3 shots that can be on the screen at once and Mega Man alone is trying to use 8 sprites in those scanlines. These things happen, and they are not so bad, we as players are used to flickering.
<br />
<br />In my game I try to stick to a limit of 4 tiles per scanline for all characters and objects, so that I can have at least two of them side by side without any flickering. With clever level design you can also prevent huge enemy reunions, specially if the game scrolls vertically as well, meaning you can spread detail vertically more than than you would if you only scrolled horizontally.

<br />I actually plan on quite a few 1 sprite wide enemies (1x2, and 1x3), that could be used along two 2 sprite wide enemies and designing the levels in such a way that (in most cases) no more than three are on screen at once. I will set the hero's lower two sprites (at the back) to have a lower priority, because this area has the least non-transparent pixels.
<br />
<br />It makes my head spin just thinking about it. Deep breaths, one step at a time.

Flicker is acceptable as long as it isn't too ridiculous.  As you said, vertical games can get away with larger sprites because most of the action (hence the player's eyes) will be "up" rather than to the side.  Flicker is easy to ignore if you are focused on a different area of the screen.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">cartlemmy wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">I actually plan on quite a few 1 sprite wide enemies (1x2, and 1x3), that could be used along two 2 sprite wide enemies and designing the levels in such a way that (in most cases) no more than three are on screen at once.

<br />
<br />no need to sweat it.  It can be done, and flicker is acceptable if it doesn't make the playing experience annoying.  I'll be paying attention to your monster and level design in your future updates.  Not too critically, just curiously.  I think your big hero is awesome.  I never considered using a hero larger than 16 pixels horizontally, so it will be cool to see how you do it.

<br />Boring? Pfft I love stuff like that. Then again I've already started work on a 6502 compiler that I'm writing for my IB Comp Sci final so....

<br />Anyway how many tools have you written so far?

<br />I really don't know, I never looked into it. My goal was to actually code entirely in 6502 assembly, with some minor flow control parsing. I really don't want to abstract the code too much.

<br />I'm still on the fence, I think the style of the game will probably require a status bar. But from what I understand there is some issue with putting a status bar at the bottom of a screen using sprite 0 hit (So I will need to use MMC3?). Or perhaps I just made that up in my crazy mind. But in either case I am only using the first 48 of 60 rows of tiles, so there is room in the nametable if need be.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />The "issue" is that there needs to be an overlap between a solid sprite pixel and a solid background pixel somewhere in x=0 to 254 (or x=8 to 254 if using the clipping window). If your background is color 0, then there might not be any  solid background pixels to guarantee an overlap unless you rewrite the map every frame to keep a solid tile under sprite 0. Another way to do it, as long as you aren't playing sampled drums, involves splitting the status bar between the top and bottom.
