I just came up with another solution.  For my future SNES games, I'll implement variable slot height into my self-defragmenting variable sized slot dynamic animation engine.  So far, only variable width have been implemented.  This means I can have a 32x40 sprite stored in ROM without compressing it to fit within 64x16, without wasting too much extra room.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=4383">psycopathicteen</a> — Sat Apr 26, 2014 4:31 pm</p><hr />

I've always said that there should be a metasprite editor (mostly for the SNES, but NES could use one as well) but I usually get responses like &quot;everything should be tailored specifically for your game&quot; even though you can have much more impressive animation in a much shorter time.  I'm not a C++ expert, so don't expect me to make my own.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=4383">psycopathicteen</a> — Sat Apr 26, 2014 10:58 am</p><hr />

You're not going to convince the current generation of NES programmers to write anything like batari BASIC.    Hobbyists use their time as a creative outlet.  It requires a huge shift in thinking and an enormous amount of personal sweat + tears to develop a third generation language accessible to the novice.<br /><br />The ideal solution is to learn C and NESICIDE.  After that you could write a meta compiler that takes your own scripting language and translates that into C.  If you still had enthusiasm after that you could make your own visual RAD tool similar to Game Maker on top of your scripting language.<br /><br /><strong>UPDATE: </strong> Just to be clear NESICIDE *IS* the real-life-right-now-best-as-it-gets answer to your topic.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=4942">slobu</a> — Thu Apr 24, 2014 11:15 am</p><hr />

Yes, it's a port of the MSX version, which wasn't a very good game. And from what I see, the Famicom one may be even worse... except for the graphics, they're actually better than the MSX game. I'm not saying, that I can make a great game, but it'll be significantly better than this one. At least I won't have enemies, that jump out right next to you or short jumping. Also, the story could be adapted better. Sure, you're Ripley, going around shooting aliens, but that's about it. There are so many different things you can add. The battle near the reactor, the APC rescue, the attack near the medic bay, Ripley going into the Hive to save Newt, Ripley in the Power loader versus the Alien Queen(that could be a great final boss battle). Even if this game was released, it was going to be a failiure. It probably wouldn't be more fun than &quot;Alien 3&quot; by LJN... ugh, don't get me started on that one... There still wouldn't be a good &quot;Alien&quot; games on NES(unless like the Angry Video Game Nerd, you like to say &quot;Yes, there are. They're called 'Contra' and 'Metroid'&quot;). There should've been a decend one. The Xenomorphs deserve it.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=6484">AlienX</a> — Thu Apr 24, 2014 7:18 am</p><hr />

Woah, woah! Relax... OK, I understand there's much more rules to the whole thing. I'm sorry I didn't mention it before, but the limitations, I'm gonna stick to, are mostly the graphical ones. Bank switching can be a difficult thing, which is why, I suppose, the homebrew scene doesn't offer a lot of stuff that uses different mappers. Also, I'm not gonna have the slowdowns. I won't put too much on the screen, either. As much as I like authenticity, some of the limitations are extremely tedious, so, I'm sticking to the ones, that one would understand just by looking at a game. I'll still make sure, it's all as authentic as possible, but not to the point it gets annoying. About the Famitracker tunes: I'll make sure not to include much and have each song be no longer than 30-60 seconds. Sorry, I didn't mention this stuff before. Now that I read my previous posts, it really looks like I want to follow absolutely every freaking limitation that the system has. Really, I'll focus on mostly following the graphics rules (Which is still quite some perfectionism, considering I even want to add that popping up effect). Another thing is, I'll never let limitations get in the way of gameplay. It won't feel unauthentic either, because I'll not try anything, that hasn't been done or couldn't be done on NES. So, sorry, I didn't mention some stuff and don't get pissed off, OK? <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=6484">AlienX</a> — Sun Apr 20, 2014 1:01 pm</p><hr />

Moving stuff around because you ran out of space in one bank, hard crashes from your NMI taking too long before its final write to $2007. Bank switch hell in general.<br /><br />The graphical stuff is the easy part. The reason my game has taken so long is because of all the optimization stuff it needs. You probably wouldn't think twice about something as simple as multiplying a number, but that can be really taxing on the NES. <br /><br />Or like... you could make a bunch of sweet tunes in famitracker that would not only not all fit in a standard mapper's space, but also be too taxing to play with gameplay going on. Or your levels wouldn't fit. <br /><br />And you'd be satisfied until you're told of something you're doing that's wrong? Would you then &quot;fix&quot; it, even if it made the game worse? Really, it shouldn't make a difference.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3504">Kasumi</a> — Sun Apr 20, 2014 11:33 am</p><hr />
