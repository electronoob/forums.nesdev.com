I agree for joypad and sound (a sound engine is called each frame so it better has to be efficient).<br />However, why write and read from SRAM should be done in assembly ? I don't see the problem of doing it in C. Maybe at the critical time while saving, but this is a matter of changing a few pointers if done correctly I guess (altough I haven't done any game that saves yet).<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=38">Bregalad</a> — Wed Jan 07, 2009 10:28 am</p><hr />

That's fun, but I recently tough about coding for the NES in C.<br /><br />And I tried to look at CC65, and honnestly, the way the libraries are set up discouraged me quickly. There is a incredible number of small asm files that are a complete mess and you have to deal with many shattered files and makefiles which are a real pain in the ass (to me at least, some more experienced C programmers may not find that bothersome).<br /><br />I think it should be perfectly possible to write decent programms in C, as long as the time critical stuff remains in assembly (aka interrupts).<br /><br />NMI and IRQ should be written in assembly because they need to update data to the PPU in a time-critical operaion, and in addition to this they should save the A, X and Y registers and resore them, something I don't think is possible in C (without using asm statements).<br />Reset should be written in assembly to clear memory, initialise the C argument stack (as well as the hardware stack) and call the C main() function.<br /><br />I think libraries should be rewritten, and that with in mind that they are not used for a console-based computer like most C compiler are, but on a video game console that is supposed to show graphics (and not plain text), and that commands such as printf() or usual stuff like that makes absolutely no sence in this situation. Other funcitons that make sense for the NES, such as writing a string to a buffer that will be updated on the PPU on the next VBlank, should replace the standard functions.<br />Even if this implies making a version of C wich is not standard, anyway it isn't because float, double and boolean types are not supported at all by CC65.<br /><br />If only CC65 could optionally have a stack that is acceded with "stack,X" instead of "(stackptr),Y", this would be much more optimised, even if it would limit the size of the stack, I think 256 bytes would be enough for something decent (if static variables are extensively used). Also, if it would be possible to retun booleans via the C flag, it would be awesome (I always do that in assembly).<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=38">Bregalad</a> — Mon Jan 05, 2009 2:31 pm</p><hr />

<div class="quotetitle">Petruza wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"><br />SO How do I decide to have or not to have CHR-RAM ?<br /></div><br /><br />Generally, you either only have CHR-ROM, or CHR-RAM.  Only in very special circumstances (with specific mappers) can you have both.  So check the .nes file you're producing.  You can either open it up in a hex editor and check offset 0x00005.  Or you can open the ROM up in an emulator which displays stats about the ROM (in FCEUXD, after you open up the ROM, go to Help | Message Log and it should say "CHR-ROM:   N x 8Kib" where 'N' is the number of CHR-ROM pages (same a the header).<br /><br />In either case... zero = CHR-RAM, and anything nonzero = CHR-ROM.<br /><br /><br />3) Well for starters you need to copy all 64 sprites at least once so that you can ensure the sprites you aren't using are hidden (by moving them offscreen).  If you don't do this, they may appear as blocks of garbage on the screen.<br /><br />- Plus, $2004 isn't as quick as you might think.  LDA abs, STA abs (a typical write) is 8 cycles total.  4 bytes per sprite = 32 cycles to draw a single sprite.  Which means 16 sprites will take 512 cycles (512 cycles is how long the DMA takes).  So if you have under 16 sprites, yeah it might be a little faster... but otherwise it isn't.  And see next point<br /><br />- Plus, it's a speed priority issue.  Organizing and drawing all the sprites can eat precious VBlank time... whereas if you organze and draw to "shadow oam" during frame rendering and do the full DMA during VBlank, you may end up using more time overall, but will use less VBlank time.<br /><br />- Also there's this whole other thing with OAM decay (which emulators generally don't emulate) where you either need to keep sprites drawn, or keep refreshing OAM or else the memory "decays" and the values change (which could result in phantom garbage sprites appearing out of nowhere).<br /><br />4)  I really suspect this is your problem, actually.  In an earlier post you said that when you tried to read the tiles from $1000... "on most emulators, only zeros come out. ".  That tells me that $1000 is totally blank.<br /><br />Did you look at a debugger?  Seriously -- if you don't have FCEUXD, get it.  Load the ROM, and go to Tools | PPU Viewer.  Make sure the tile graphics are exactly what you expected them to be.  You'll be surprised how much easier debugging is when you use a debugger.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=33">Disch</a> — Mon Jan 05, 2009 5:00 am</p><hr />
