<br />
<br />I am working on figuring out what kind of casing to provide. If anybody wants to discuss this with me, along with features of a customizable expansion base, please ring me on my mobile at 908-616-8747.
<br />
<br />I will shoot some photos of the connector, and maybe one of the connector board proto, bur that is not what I would consider proof against vapourware. A couple more weeks waiting for something like this arenâ€™t going to hurt... 
<br />
<br />I am only one guy after all, with a legitimate business and the funds to do this, but one man nevertheless with a finite amount of time each day, so there is only so much that I cam do at once and I have other NES/FC projects on the cooker. Replacement ROB parts is another... 
<br />
<br />At least I think I secured somebody with experience in plastics, but I still need a VERILOG programmer...

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />UPDATE:
<br />
<br />I really wanted to wait until I had the final part in hand to update this thread again, but it's nearing the end of the month and I want to keep everybody in the light on what's been happening lately...
<br />
<br />There was a (hopefully final) delay caused by tooling for the socket's edge-connectorL It's a double-edged sword for me, as it increased the tooling cost dramatically, but I'm paying it to ensure the availability of these for the foreseeable future. Stupid generous me...
<br />
<br />I guess at the least, it'll be wiki-worthy...
<br />
<br />If you want the technical details on what happened, <em>read on</em>:
<br />The EXP port has an edge-connector made of plastic that is a <strong>completely non-standard thickness</strong> and it required additional tooling to create a proper fit. The second samples were not quite right, and I want to make it perfect.
<br />
<br /><em>I really have to wonder if there is a huge bin (or a landfill) full of these in Nippon somewhere that Nintendo Co., Ltd made in 1985/6, but never used for anything...</em>
<br />
<br />I still have to talk to their R&amp;D folks about ensuring that it is snug, but still easily removable. (I also still have to upload the photos of my ugly, modified socket, which are on my Canon EOS XTi...)
<br />
<br />I also have to EMS an extra NES to the manufacturer so that they get the height of the connector right, and I will be doing that in the next couple days, along with a huge cheque to cover the extra tooling costs.
<br />
<br />I hope that, if I need taller ones int he future, that there won't me any surge in price, although I can always make a sub-board on a ribbon cable and use the same part.
<br />
<br />I have my fingers crossed that there are no further delays, as I wanted this done by July, and now it is almost August. I know that a lot og you are a combination if impatient and skeptical, so I'm doing my best to get this done as soon as possible without sacrificing product quality.
<br />
<br />Thank you all for your patience and faith in this project.
<br />
<br />-Xious
