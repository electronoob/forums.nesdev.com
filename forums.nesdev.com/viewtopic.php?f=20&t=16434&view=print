You can use this to manually fire a STAT interrupt via LYC. The game Sagaia does this, but other than that it's a very rare edge case even among commercial titles.

That bit of info is from Pan Docs, which is incorrect. Any writes to LY while the LCD is enabled are ignored. When the LCD is disabled, LY is forcibly set to 0, and since it's read-only, the value never changes. A long time ago, I think someone may have written to LY while the LCD was disabled, then read the value of LY, and assumed all writes reset the counter. Admittedly, I haven't yet fixed that part in my own emulator; still using the outdated Pan Docs in my source code. I'll change it, eventually.<br /><br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">And also when is the comparison done otherwise, is it done at the end of HBlank?</div><br /><br />For anything related to Game Boy timing, I'd highly recommend <a href="https://github.com/AntonioND/giibiiadvance/blob/master/docs/TCAGBD.pdf" class="postlink">AntonioND's The Cycle Accurate Game Boy Docs</a>. According to him, LY is incremented/compared after each 456 cycles necessary to process a line. For most displayable lines, that means after the last line's HBlank, when entering Mode 2. If I recall correctly, there's some funny stuff happening on Line 0, so read up on that (Kirby's Dream Land 2's intro relies on that behavior).

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />GB documentation is a mess. Stuff is scattered all over the place in different resources. And on top of that, we're still learning new things even today. Just look at gekkio, endrift, or LIJI32's work. I've been tackling lots of crazy accessories as well (Barcode Taisen Bargidun, the Barcode Boy, the Full Changer). I'm just now finishing up my research into the DMG-07, the 4-player adapter. There's like zero info on it; no one's bothered to touch it despite all these years.<br /><br />Anyway, as for testing stuff on real hardware, definitely grab yourself a couple of Game Boys and a flashcart of some sort. GBCs or GBAs are cheap enough. DMGs in actual good condition are a bit pricier (like $5 or $10 USD more on eBay) probably because they're older and less common, and popular with hardware modders. I personally have an EMS 64M Smart Card or whatever its technically called. EverDrives are just too expensive for my needs, and BennVenn's ElCheapo's have been &quot;Sold Out&quot; forever. If you want to go the really cheap route, you can buy fake GB carts online (usually with the words &quot;GAME&quot; in the molding instead of &quot;GAME BOY&quot;). These are generally reflashable if you have a cart reader/writer.<br /><br />Writing tests isn't so bad though. If you know your way around GBZ80 assembly and have an idea of what parts of the hardware you want to examine, it's usually trial and error until you come up with some results <img src="./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" />

It's not necessary, but yes, having a backup is always a good idea. Game Boys are pretty durable and fixable, but I myself somehow ended up having 8 (1 DMG, 2 Pockets, 2 GBCs, 1 AGB-001, 1 AGS-001, and 1 AGS-101).<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">zerowalker wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">I mean one would want to be able to have something that can test the weird quirks right?<br /></div><br /><br />Anything that's MBC1, MBC3, or MBC5 is good enough for testing. Most flashcarts are programmable, so whatever ROM you put inside will determine what kind of MBC it simulates (it checks the header). I generally stick to 32KB MBC1 ROM + RAM + Battery. Test ROMs are generally very, very small, and I like to save any results to the cart RAM so I can analyze things in a hex editor later. I have a cart reader, so I can pull up the save file as a binary. If you don't have a cart reader, you'll have to come up with visual &quot;PASS/FAIL&quot; graphics and print things to the screen like blargg's tests.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">zerowalker wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">Can't imagine where 4 players would be of use on a Gameboy,  how it would even process that external information.</div><br /><br />If you're interested, <a href="https://shonumi.github.io/articles.html" class="postlink">I write a bunch of articles about emulation</a>, so once I finish implementing the DMG-07 4 Player Adapter in my emulator, I'll post a very detailed explanation about how it works. Without going into much detail, the DMG-07 basically pings the status of all connected Game Boys and broadcasts that to each. So each Game Boy knows which one is connected and which player it is (e.g. Player 1, Player 2, Player 3, or Player 4). Player 1 acts as master, all other Game Boys are slaves. Player 1 starts the synchronization process, and then each Game Boy basically takes turns sending data over the link cables (starts with Player 1, ends with Player 4, repeats). The DMG-07 is responsible for broadcasting the data to each Game Boy, so anything Player 1 sends, Players 2, 3, and 4 also receive. Anything Player 2 sends, Players 1, 3, and 4 receive, and so on.<br /><br />It's really fascinating, but it ended up being used by like only a dozen or so games. By the mid-1990s, it had been totally forgetten. 4-player support was an afterthought for the original Game Boy, while the Game Boy Advance handled it like a professional <img src="./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" />

There are tools for writing ROMs to my EMS 64M Smart Card, but no tools for reading the saves. So when I first started, all my tests had to use visual cues, since I couldn't read anything I saved to RAM. I got a cart reader/writer (BennVenn's Joey Squinson Gen 2) and that allowed me to read save files from my flash cart. Better flashcarts with better tools simply use SD cards, so there's no issue there. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">zerowalker wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">As for the 4 Player thing, really interesting.<br />So it's based on player 1 and then acts like a serial connection, going to one by one until the last one?<br />Or wait, ehm that can't be right as it would only make sense when player 1 sends information.<br />Or is it prioritized, meaning player 3 sends to 1, 2 then 4 etc?<br /></div><br /><br />The DMG-07 has a multiplexer built into it, meaning input from one Game Boy can be duplicated to others simultaneously. Player 1 sends out 4 bytes before letting Players 2, 3, and 4 send 4 bytes as well. Each time a Game Boy sends something, all the other Game Boys receive it. But only when a Game Boy sends something during it's turn will it be broadcast to the other Game Boys. For example, if Player 2 tried sending data when it's Player 3 or Player 4's turn to send data, Player 2 gets completely ignored. So...<br /><br />Player 1 sends 4 bytes, all other Game Boys receive sent bytes<br />Player 2 sends 4 bytes, all other Game Boys receive sent bytes<br />Player 3 sends 4 bytes, all other Game Boys receive sent bytes<br />Player 4 sends 4 bytes, all other Game Boys receive sent bytes<br />Repeat endlessly<br /><br />But now we are getting a bit off-topic I guess <img src="./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" />
