<br />A conforming dual NTSC/PAL TV should switch to PAL "pixel" aspect ratio (where "pixel" = 1/341 scanline period) when fed a PAL signal.

<br />
<br />Verdauga Greeneyes took a screenshot of <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://i73.photobucket.com/albums/i221/byuusan/som.gif">http://i73.photobucket.com/albums/i221/byuusan/som.gif</a><!-- m --> , at a very high resolution (2592x1944), and with a tripod to make sure the image was minimally slanted. I then cropped the "Secret of Mana" logo out of the picture.
<br />
<br />Below are my results:
<br />
<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">&nbsp;127x 43 = 2.953488 -- 256x239 1:1 image size<br />1140x272 = 4.191176 -- CRT TV image size<br /><br />43x4.191176 = 180.220568<br /><br />180.220568 / 127 = 1.419060</div>
<br />
<br />So, ~1.42x is very close to tepples' ~1.39x, enough to be the difference between two different TV sets.
<br />
<br />But, as we can see, it's definitely way off compared to NTSC's 8:7 (~1.14x). I will probably use a rounded average between our three samples. Maybe 1.40x. It's "close enough", but probably not 100% perfect.
<br />
<br />If anyone wants, I can forward them the PAL TV screenshot for double verification. I know it's not a perfect test, but it's the best we can do.

<br />I think it's clear that there is no "perfect", since TVs differ slightly in how they distort the image.
<br />
<br />I think porting tepple's test to the SNES is a perfect solution, along with emulator authors providing a horizontal stretch slider so that the user can make the correct box square on whatever they're displaying the emulator with. This way the user can calibrate it as closely as desired, or throw it off to match a particular TV.
<br />
<br />We should add NTSC/PAL detection to the ROMs to simplify things for the user.

<br />If your emulator assumes square pixels, then your video card will just shoot those square pixels straight out to the TV, likely at 7/12 color cycle per pixel, unless you can tell your video card to run in some 560x480 pixel overscan mode.

<br />Because TVs don't have pixels, just scanlines whose hue/saturation/luminance varies from left to right. It's the video <strong>ENCODER</strong> chip that determines the width of a pixel. The NES has a different video encoder than your PC's video output, so the pixel width probably differs. Your PC's video output probably uses a pixel width that matches scanline height, resulting in square pixels on the TV screen, because PC pixels are usually square and you'd want the image to appear nearly the same on a TV as it does on your PC display.
<br />
<br />There's really no difference between the above situation and a normal PC video card connected to a CRT-based display. In the same way, the PC video card determines the width of a pixel, and could make them rectangular if it wanted.

<br />
<br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">If you capture the TV output through a video card and measure the frame, isn't this the correct thing?</div>Most TV cards don't capture the image properly, at least not with default settings.
<br />
<br />Correct pixel aspect ratio (NTSC):
<br />Active scanline is 52+59/90 µs (ITU-R BT.470-6). NES' pixel clock is precisely 6/4*Fsc = 7,5*63/88 MHz, giving 282.7 pixels, or 282 full pixels horizontally.
<br />Active height is 486 scanlines for interlaced, or 243 for progressive pictures (one is always black in progressive, so 242. Since that black line is part of the 4:3 area however, we must include it). 
<br />Therefore, the NES active area including overscan is 282x243. For square pixels forming a 4:3 image, you'd need 243*4/3=324 horizontal pixels, giving you the NTSC NES' <em>precise</em> pixel aspect ratio of 324/282, or <strong>54/47</strong>, about 1.148936 <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />
<br />
<br />Correct pixel aspect ratio (PAL):
<br />Active scanline is 52 µs (ITU-R BT.1700). NES' pixel clock is (1135/4 + 1/625)*15625*6/5 Hz, giving 276.7 pixels, say 276 full pixels.
<br />Active height is 576 scanlines for interlaced, or 288 for progressive.
<br />Therefore, the NES active area including overscan is 276x288. For square pixels, we'd need 288*4/3=384 horizontal pixels, giving you the PAL NES' <em>precise</em> pixel aspect ratio of 384/276, or <strong>32/23</strong>, about 1.391304. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />
<br />
<br />These values are what you should go for, not by empirically measuring screencaps from consumer-grade TV cards, which rarely get things right, or pushing a ruler against your TV. And if you're trying to get your emulator to imitate the image of every cheap-ass TV out there, you'd have to simulate curvature, overscan, phosphor chromaticities and aperture, dust on the tube, the influence of the earth's magnetic field depending on your particular geographic location (no, really!)...

<br />The only question is whether that weird <a href="http://nesdev.com/bbs/viewtopic.php?t=2113#17933" class="postlink">"pulse"</a> pixel should be considered part of the active area or not; if so, we would need to go with 283 and 324/283 (1.144876) pixel aspect ratio, which would be most unfortunate, since 283 is a prime number. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" />
<br />
<br />(I have seen this pulse on imported Japanese NTSC VHS videos, too; never on US ones. I suspect this has something to do with NTSC-J, maybe a help for the TV to properly center the picture, as it can no longer tell the active from the blanking area by looking for a 7.5% setup.)
