		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Well, there is some good feedback here.  I'm a little discouraged and overwhelmed, but I'll get over it.<br /><br />So pretty much I think I found a few people that can help me out on NintendoAge.  What I'm really looking for is not advertisement, but rather a video playthrough of all the bosses and levels (2 people so far I know of have found all 6 bosses) to learn what works and what doesn't in terms of the level design and play mechanics, weapons, and bosses throughout the game.<br /><br />Many of the things mentioned I know how to fix and will just take time to solve.<br /><br />However the mid screen scrolling glitching I have done quite a bit of experimenting with it and have not had much luck removing it in a way that still works on the powerpak.  I will make another post with my IRQ routine and see if any of you guys have some ideas.<br /><br /><br />@Bananamos did you manages to get back the beginning without the wall jump?  If so how did you manage to do it?

Unfortunately, I get stuck at the guy who gives you a clue to find a projectile.<br /><br />I'd also watch out for putting bright colored tiles in back of the exit and entrance icons.  Since the exit/entrance icons flicker strong colors basically block them out.

The room to the left of him. zigzag climb to the top right corner and use the exit there.  Continue upward and right and you will eventually find the boss.

This game I get stuck waay before the others.  It'd be a pretty short let's play without a little advice <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />

The rolly balls make Miura easier.<br /><br />As far as dropping down, I considered it, but decided to go with using a+down as a way to stay in one spot and aim in any direction.  If I were to switch to drop down, I think it would only be for the platforms you can travel upwards through. (similar to how Bionic Commando has 2 platform types)

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Your game looks like one of the better ones currently in development, so I highly encourage you to keep on working hard <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />But... I've seen your message on Nintendo Age &amp; here and would like to suggest you few basic rules when you want to get feedback (either on in progress productions or also proper releases). Certainly this will take little longer than what you rushed out, but at the end it will raise more attention towards the people you want to attract.<br /><br />a) Screenshot! (if you do not have space, there are free picture hosters) -&gt; you are entirely missing them<br />b) Video! -&gt; Well, you did that, but you said on your own it was one month old. no one will be able to see the progress work of one month with an old video<br />c) Text/Description should be better repositioned and brought straight to the point. What is it? What is it about? What do you want? Always talk about yourself in the third person... there are so many &quot;I's&quot; you know... (at least in the very beginning!)<br />Something like: Hiatus War by srndwave is a Metroidvania type game with six bosses and about 50 levels. The game is about 40-50% done and I'd like to ask everyone here for some feedback. Download the game here... If you want to beta-test, please get in touch with me via ...&quot;<br /><br />other thoughts:<br />* considering you want to attract beta-testers, how should they get in touch with you if that person does not have a na or nesdev account?<br />* do not rely on &quot;let's play&quot; authors, as long as your game is yet not finished. they will feel like you want to waste their time. there is also no point in playing a game which is not yet fully developed. just imagine they will accept your request, you think you'll get a second chance once the game is done? everyone will see a lets play of your &quot;old garbage&quot; and the final product remains unrecognized.<br />* try to get the word out onto the various homebrew pages and retro-gaming pages, sure it's lots of work, but it will work out at the end. especially for such pages, it's important to have material to work with (screenshots/video).<br />* if your game is supposed to be that &quot;massive&quot; (I'd call 50 levels massive) it will for sure get attention, but people need to get a place for updates, consider a small blog for your game.<br /><br />hope this doesn't sound too rude, but there is so much potential behind your game - you should really put some energy into public relation / marketing too <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />regards<br />kojote
