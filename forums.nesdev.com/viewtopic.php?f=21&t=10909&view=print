		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />The NES doesn't have HDMI. It doesn't even have HDMA. Nor does it have a lot of intermediate color shadess like those needed for a night sky background. So I needed to make a gradient sky background a different way. I made 1/8, 1/4, 3/8, and 1/2 density repeating tiles and checked them in blargg's snes_ntsc to make sure the diagonal stripes aren't as obvious as they are in, say, the title screen of Dr. Mario. Then I made transitions between the stripes, placing pixels carefully to make the artifacts blend into the RF noise. Finally I flipped the tiles horizontally and vertically and inverted them to make the bottom half of the transition.<br /><br /><div class="attachtitle">Attachment:</div><div class="attachcontent">

	</div><br /><br />Feel free to use this 8x128 pixel gradient pattern in your games. The pattern might need to be modified for ColecoVision, MSX, SMS, and Genesis games because of their VDPs' vertical color artifact pattern. Is there a preview program like snes_ntsc that takes a 256px or 320px image and renders it for these platforms?

When you use heavy dithering like this for foreground objects it looks OK, but it doesn't work as well with skies, 'cause they aren't supposed to have any texture. This picture looks particularly weird, considering that the dirt, which is supposed to have some texture, is completely flat.<br /><br />Considering all the limitations of the NES, horizontal stripes are the best for sky gradients IMO. It might not be very realistic, but it's a pleasant stylized look, unlike heavy dithering that ends up looking like noise.<br /><br />EDIT: I couldn't find any examples of skies, but look at the gradients in the title screens of Seirei Densetsu Lickle and Darkwing Duck, or the enemy introduction screens in Mega Man 4. There are probably many more examples. There's a homebrew game on the MSX with a sky like this: The Cure. I think it looks infinitely more pleasant than the alternative.

The actual pattern could probably be tweaked a bit. I'd probably widen the middle section, where both colors are distributed equally, and try avoid the bevel effect that appears to have formed around it. I could try drawing a different pattern, but I only have a touchpad to work with right now and I really can't draw with it.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Even if you took the first gradient example and made the bottom 2/3 of the sky solid, it would make it less distracting. Complex dithering patterns can be hard on the eyes. I like to keep it simple, keeping colors mostly solid with light dithering between them. Perhaps the example would also look better dithering the two darkest blues instead of black and dark blue? I could certainly be wrong about this.<br /><br />The 2nd example is also a little distracting. The way the lines are spaced, it creates the illusion of depth (like looking down a corridor).
