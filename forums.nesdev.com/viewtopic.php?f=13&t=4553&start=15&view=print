<br />For one thing, I'd have to ban myself first. I first joined nesdev before Yahoo! bought eGroups, even before eGroups bought ONElist. And yes, I was annoying back then, especially about the lack of solid information on NES sound. I quit the scene for a while and concentrated on PC and (later) GBA until more of the NES was reversed.

<br />
<br />Complaining about missing information related to the board subject could be understandable since it was missing at the time.
<br />
<br />Coming to a nes development forum and asking random question on the general forum only is not.

<br />
<br />Yeah, I cleaned up that act. Most of the questions were loosly related to NES development, however. 
<br />BTW, I am not any other member. I just want to make that clear. Check my IP adresses, It'll be more clear. 
<br />Sorry for being such a jerk, It's probbably the high sugar/caffiene intake to stay awake. I usually log in around midnight and start feeling like a crazed dog or something.  
<br />
<br />
<br />And a note, These are the best forums I've been on. Usually they are full of immature freaks who think there right even if they are wrong. 
<br />So I will stop these stupid actions and have a better act.
<br />
<br />
<br />EDIT: WTF? Why Split it from that thread, It was apprpriate and on subject. We were discussing "engrish". It really seemed fitting to bring that up.
<br />
<br />I'm nothing like jargon. His avatar says "Blow me", I never blow any kind of cart. That's what isopropyl alcohol is for.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />it's been a topic of heated contention in all gaming circles i've come in contact[heh, pun] with...why do some swear by it and others claim it destroys the cart? personally i've developped a ritual over the years of dry blowing into the cartridge, then breathing hot air along the top edge of the board, inserting it quickly, and tucking the cartridge into the rightmost position after it's down by grasping the two closest corners and shimmying it to the right until it doesn't go any further. 
<br />
<br />i'm sorry for sharing that to those who have weak stomachs, i know it might seem perverse, I blame my backwards twisted upbringing.

<br />I'd like to say why I don't get on too often. It's because I have Dial up at my house and when I'm home I don't go online. Although I am right now.
<br />I only go online when I'm staying at another house or when I'm at some place somewhere. Otherwise logged in all the time.
