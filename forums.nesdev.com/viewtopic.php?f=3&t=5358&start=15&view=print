Why /DBE I don't know, it can't rely on CPU access to sync with the PPU (must sample video signal).<br /><br />I can't get it to tune in well on any US cable channel frequencies, too lazy to try air channels or tap composite video. Because of that I can't be sure what the back switch does but almost certainly it also switches from 50/60Hz because of the jumpers. This add-on board was made in early 1988 so it's pretty clear Nintendo didn't come up with it themselves.</div>
<br />
<br />Hmmm, interesting. I wonder whether Nintendo themselves manufactured the power/video board, or whether it was fitted by the company which imported Famicoms into whichever country it was sold in.
<br />
<br />Probably the cheapest way to get a picture from it would be to buy a USB TV tuner for your computer. Most of those have multi-standard tuners.
<br />
<br />The PCB of your console is a normal Japanese Famicom board, I think. (Is the crystal 21.47727 MHz?) The switch on the back is most likely a 50/60Hz switch (and the chip part number MK5060 suggests it has that ability).
<br />
<br />If Nintendo did make the entire console, the later HK Famicom would probably have been cheaper to make due to not needing hand-wired alterations. The hand-wired parts remind me of the "PAL booster" products which were available for the Super Famicom. They plugged into the SFC multi-out port, and had a 50/60Hz switch. Internally, the console was modified by rewiring a couple of pins on the multi-out socket to carry the clock signal (instead of S-video Y and C if I recall). That allowed the 50/60Hz switch to function. The alterations to your console are probably similar.
<br />
<br />The picture of the underside you uploaded is quite blurry. What is the text on the underside of the power/video board?
