		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Sorry for being terse; phone keyboard discourages editing.<br /><br />Regarding the audio output drivers, unless they run on a split power supply (+/-), they'll need AC (capacitor) coupling on the output to remove the DC bias. Those would then form a divider at signal frequencies (AC).<br /><br /><a href="http://i11.photobucket.com/albums/a173/Djsefnet/page5.gif" class="postlink">Here</a>, just to the left of the data bus on the right center (all the vertical lines).<br /><br /><img src="http://i.imgur.com/hdO9xDh.png" alt="Image" /><br /><br />The outputs of the transistor buffers come up from the bottom on either side for each channel, then run through series resistors and series capacitors. Further, they're not push-pull output stages anyway, so there could be no fighting even if there weren't series resistors and capacitors, just one's pull-down resistor ganging up with the other's.

Seriously, it could just as well be written in Polish and I would have gotten just as much information from it.<br /><br />Could you explain to us hardware illiterates the relevance of what you wrote (i.e. &quot;using the Y plug will make your SNES catch fire!&quot;) and what action should be taken to solve this issue without any negative side effects?

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />tokumaru, I offered that research simply for the hardware-inclined to verify that it will cause no damage. I definitely didn't put the effort to make it accessible to anyone.<br /><br />Essentially each audio output has a resistor and capacitor in series with it. These alone are plenty to avoid any significant tug-of-war when you connect the outputs and play a game that uses phase-inverted channels, like Secret of Mana 2 or King Arthur's World.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Thanks blargg. I wish I knew more about hardware, but that's so much harder to learn on my own than software! Not to mention that there are certain analog factors involved that are hard to predict or measure objectively, unlike software, which is 100% precise and predictable 0s and 1s! =)

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I've played with electronics since I was 7 or so but didn't start understanding it to the mild degree that I do now until a few years ago when I began reading the first several chapters of The Art of Electronics over and over over the months until the really basic things started to sink in. Before that it was just seat-of-the-pants hacking and combining of digital things which let you somewhat get away without grasping much beyond logic levels (I didn't even know about logic level interfacing and always struggled mixing TTL and CMOS, not even realizing that they didn't always mix well).
