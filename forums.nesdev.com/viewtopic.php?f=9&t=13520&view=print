		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />So here lately I've been finishing a project I actually started about two years ago.<br /><br />I began working on it and learning Atmel AVR microcontrollers in 2013 and since then have done many other microcontroller projects. This project uses a Nuvoton NUC123 microcontroller. I have finalized the hardware design and have sent my board design off to get my first set of boards for this. Very soon I plan to begin selling them (about a month). <br /><br />All the source code and hardware will be open source.<br /><br />Here is a list of features I have completed so far. <br /><br />- 128mbit flash (holds 256 disk sides, bigger is <em>still</em> possible)<br />- Loading and saving works properly<br />- USB connectivity for writing and reading flash, writing and reading disks<br />- Firmware update mode (idiot-proof, special bootloader mode included in case you brick it)<br />- Built in disk selection menu on power up<br />- Plugs directly into RAM adaptor<br />- Console app based on fdsstick console app<br />- Console app not based on fdsstick app but using loopy's disk manipulation code<br />- GUI app utilizing Qt library for portability (currently only Windows works with it)<br />- Button to swap disk sides, stays within currently selected game<br /><br />Issues:<br />- Disk writing does not work with the tototek mod.  Further investigation is in progress.<br /><br />Here is a YouTube link to me demoing it with the menu. <br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://youtu.be/zxUs1bfGqCo">http://youtu.be/zxUs1bfGqCo</a><!-- m --><br /><br /><strong>Photo of first batch of boards, first board assembled.</strong><br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://i.imgur.com/JF5myO0.jpg">http://i.imgur.com/JF5myO0.jpg</a><!-- m --><br /><br /><strong>I am assembling the boards, and selling them.  Please see <a href="http://fdsemu.com" class="postlink">http://fdsemu.com</a> for information and purchasing.</strong><br /><br />The price is $30 now. But I still have coupon code for you...<br /><br /><strong>Use coupon code for $5 off your purchase, code: <em>nesdev4life</em></strong><br />Code valid until 1/31/2016

You've always been around and I look up to you and the others who have been into nesdev longer than I have, when the irc channel was going strong 15 years ago.  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /><br /><br />I have finished up some boards that have arrived.  My software still needs a little bit more work before it is fully functional but I am providing the source and binary to the modified fdsstick software that I have used during development.<br /><br />Selling them for $40 for all flash sizes, three different sizes are available... 32mbit, 64mbit, and 128 mbit, each holds 63, 127, and 255 disks respectively.<br /><br />I just finished this semester so I have some free time between semesters, I will be completing (hopefully) the Qt GUI version and the command line programs.<br /><br />The firmware is completed, just cleaning up the code before it goes onto github too.<br /><br />Please see <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://fdsemu.com">http://fdsemu.com</a><!-- m --> for information and purchasing.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I've had mine about a week now. The updated gui is working fine, and the device is working perfectly. My only gripe is that the program doesn't register input from a 15 pin controller on a Famicom, but I was told this would be looked into for a future release. Good solid product, works as advertised with any FDS game I've thrown at it.<br /><br />I think I might try to mod it into my RAM Adapter case at some point and do away with the cable.
