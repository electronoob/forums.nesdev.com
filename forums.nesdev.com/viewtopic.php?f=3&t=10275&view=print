		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Hey all.  Long time.<br /><br />For those of you who remember me (and care), I've pretty much moved on from the emulation scene.  I just don't have the time for it anymore, as my free time is occupied by other interests.  I might come back to it some day, but for now I'm going to continue my extended hiatus.<br /><br />I came here because I stumbled upon the below page on the wiki, which was raising some questions that I felt I should answer:<br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://wiki.nesdev.com/w/index.php/Talk:INES_Mapper_001">http://wiki.nesdev.com/w/index.php/Talk:INES_Mapper_001</a><!-- m --><br /><br /><br />Let me go on the record with this:<br /><br />1)  The mapper docs I wrote all those years ago started as a compilation of personal notes I gathered from various sources when I was working on my emu.  At the time I started it I don't even think the wiki was set up yet... or if it was it was in its infancy.  Other mapper sources were scattered around and it was all but impossible to find a single, comprehensive source for mapper behavior.  Now that the wiki fills this role better than any single document could, it provides a complete replacement as far as I'm concerned.<br /><br />2)  If there is information in the docs that is incorrect... by all means, <em>please correct it</em>.  Please do not retain false information for fear of hurting my feelings or stepping on my toes.  Believe me, the only thing I've wanted was easy access to accurate information.  I do not want any of my prior work to be a hindrance to that effort in any way, shape or form.<br /><br />3)  It's better to remove incorrect information entirely, rather than add a note saying the info is incorrect.  Bad info is bad info, and retaining bad info next to good info is just a source of confusion.  Keep it simple, keep it correct.<br /><br />4)  Don't worry about retaining any credit for me on those docs.  As far as I'm concerned the info is public domain.  I would not have the slightest problem if my name were removed from the pages entirely.  I never cared about any kind of credit... I only cared about emulation.  And in fact, I don't deserve credit for most of that info anyway, since as previously mentioned it was largely just compiled from other sources.<br /><br /><br /><br />I'm really glad to see that the scene is still going strong.  Good luck to everyone, and I hope nesdev continues to stay strong!<br /><br />-Disch
