<br />
<br />Another temporary "option", if OK with you, would be to post an item on the front page explaining and linking to your site. Everyone visiting the site so far knows this already, but as it has been posted elsewhere now, others may not. Let me know if this works for you for the time being.
<br />
<br />Anyways I'm open to any layout/design suggestions, as I said before, I have about as much artistic skill as the keyboard I'm typing on <img src="./images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" alt=":(" title="Sad" />

<br />IMO, it's a bit uglier now, but it'll have to do <img src="./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" /> I found someone willing to work on a new site design not to far down the road, which hopefully should prove to be much better.

<br />
<br />To answer your questions:
<br />
<br />1) Yes, this is a planned feature. Couldn't give you an ETA, but it will happen.
<br />
<br />2) Do you mean have it accessible from other programs like emulators and such? My plan originally was to allow one to download a binary database, containing only the data you choose  and to have a simple interface for it. Having it access the database "online" has the obvious advantage of always being up to date, but the disadvantage is that it would be quite slow compared to have a local file like above. For example: from my software, if you scan a folder of files, it takes roughly 1/4 second to process each one.
<br />
<br />I will probably just provide both methods and then one can use whichever they wish.
<br />
<br />3) I have no plans on using MD5, as it seems unneccesary. If you have a good reason for wanting it though, I would consider it.

<br />Any 32-bit hash function is insufficient, as two ROM hacks' hash values are likely to collide. In addition, because CRC of any length is trivial to forge, it's easy for someone to pass off a ROM that displays Goatse (highly not-safe-for-work (link removed, aw c'mon lol -admin)) as any existing ROM. There are several <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptographic_hash_function" class="postlink">cryptographic hash functions</a> that you can use. SHA-1 (160 bits) is still good for 126 of those bits as of August 2005.

Considering that all the data comes straight from CopyNES, one would have to go thru some trouble in order to supply their own data. Either one would have to load their data onto a RAM cart and dump it, or hack the program while running. And why anyone would want to do this to begin with, is beyond me <img src="./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" />
<br />
<br />Besides, I was under the impression that MD5 sums could be faked as well...

<br />
<br />Intentional <em>are</em> the problem. Imagine someone who manages to widely disseminate a ROM that displays sick porn (e.g. goatse, bakla, tubgirl, lemonparty) and has the same PRG CRC32 and the same CHR CRC32 as the official ROM. GoodNES (or other tools that use CRC32) won't be able to tell the difference.
<br />
<br />True, MD5 is largely broken, but SHA-1 (160 bit) can't be so easily faked as of now. The best collision is 2^63 steps, which means it's roughly as good as a 126 bit hash.

<br />
<br />And that's only a harmless application of intentional hash collisions. Worse would be hash-preserving modifications that cause glitches in accurate emulators, but otherwise don't significantly change the behavior of the game. Then you'd have people reporting problems that you can't reproduce, even though you are using PRG and CHR data with matching hashes.

<br />
<br />Yes, it would probably be best to go back to the original dumps and SHA-1 them. In fact, it might be better to SHA-1 each 16 KB PRG ROM segment and each 8 KB CHR ROM segment for easier early detection of hacked versions.

<br />Yes, it went right to the top of my list. I have already added the functionality to the software/database. Now I just need to write something up to rescan all my (and others) dumps. It shouldn't be to much trouble, a large number of the dumps were from me. I will continue to store the CRC32.
