Well, everyone has its problems. Personally, since 3 days I cannot turn on my computer without start SNES9x with Megaman X2 on it, and I cannot stop playing Megaman X2. I have no reason to play it, but I just cannot avoid it. That's quite frustrating, since I didn't advance in more serious projects today.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=38">Bregalad</a> — Mon Jul 10, 2006 2:18 pm</p><hr />

I happened to me before a couple of times.<br /><br />All I can say is... enjoy! These situations don't last forever! =)<br /><br />You can always pretend you are doing something usefull. I know it may be hard to do anything since they haven't told you what you'll be doing, but even if it's not for the company, you could pretend you are reading about things that are related to the company and your job. Read about database stuff, or place some random database related words on your desktop, but in fact read something else. If people around you can see your monitor, that is.<br /><br />I sometimes buy myself free time by pretending I'm busy. If you keep a busy face and stare at a page full of text, people will think you are doing something important and won't bother you. I usually do that to read technical documents and stuff like that (and visit forums, like this one). Most of my interests are pretty easy to go by unnoticed, as I don't like messangers or anything else that indicates you are in fact doing nothing. Also, I read and write a lot of english text, and people are a bit intimidated by that sometimes, and they are, most of the time, not able to immediatelly tell what you're doing.<br /><br />In my last job, I went like that for about 2 months, without doing any actual work for the company. Those days are over, though. My new job is much more demanding, but I still manage to get a couple of days off once in a while.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=95">tokumaru</a> — Mon Jul 10, 2006 12:55 pm</p><hr />

I'm here are this job I started Friday in an office doing database stuff, but they haven't really got around to telling me what I'm actually going to be doing yet.  So basically they've been saying "just hang out until so-and-so gets in".<br /><br />But yeah, mostly I've just been sitting around for hours on end waiting around.  It kind of sucks and it sort of gets me worried like I really should be doing something.  So yeah... boring.  But the easiest money I've ever made<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=33">Disch</a> — Mon Jul 10, 2006 11:59 am</p><hr />
