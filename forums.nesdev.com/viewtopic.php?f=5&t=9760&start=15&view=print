I've looked at them enough so I can usually tell which is which, but come on.<br />I forget characters more often when writing than I do with reading. If I forget while reading, it's usually with め and　ぬ. But then I remember, the loop on the bottom right is characteristic of other N- characters. Characters I often forget when writing are:<br /><br />Hirigana: Sa (don't know why; it's just like a recurring brain freeze), Mu, Nu<br />Katakana: Nu, Ne, So/No (I get these confused)<br /><br />Also, katakana has a distinct style from hirigana. It looks more like twigs or bones. It's a lot more simplistic, and limited in curves. It's also easier for me to remember because half the time when reading Japanese, my only clue as to what's going on is English words spelled out in katakana!

A good font will have the dash almost horizontal for n / shi and almost vertical for so / tsu so it's impossible to confuse. I do exactly this when writing and will never confuse them again (hopefully...)<br /><br />The problem is that now that I use a vertical dash I confuse ソ with リ.<br />In hiragana, I confuse り with い.<br /><br />So I can officially claim that &quot;ri&quot; is the worst kana of them all, in both cases (not counting the ja / jo etc.. which are the very worst)<br /><br /><br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">They are all so similar that I still misread one or two (especially rarer ones like &quot;nu&quot;.)</div><br />The ones you said causes no problem to me.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />A language barrier isn't the only reason for subtitles or bad dubs. Otherwise, how will we know what characters in NES games' cut scenes are saying? Not all classic 8-bit consoles have big enough storage to hold a full voiceover, and not all games have the budget for a well-acted voiceover even if there were enough storage and enough compression (such as ESS MX as used in Impossible Mission). Remember the homebrew complexity discussion a couple years back? And how will people who are hard of hearing understand such TV or such games? Sure, in the coming system of things, we'll all have perfect hearing and speak one pure language, but that's on the other side of World War III.

IMO, all dubs are bad because no matter how good the actors are, the lips will always be out of sync. Cartoons can sometimes be dubbed well though, since they have varying degrees of lip movement accuracy.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">2) Subtitles are required for people with hearing disability</div><br />True, but even as it is today movie theaters only put subtitles in foreign movies, so people with hearing disabilities are screwed either way. At home though, where you can freely enable/disable subtitles, you can get rid of them if your hearing is good and all movies are in the language you speak.<br /><br />BTW, my original comment wasn't exactly serious. Yeah, it would be nice if everyone spoke the same language (for reason much more significant than dubs and subs), but if the attitude towards the idea of a global language all around the world is the same as the one I see here in Brazil, that won't happen anytime soon. Here in Brazil there's a lot of hate towards anglicisms, much like Bregalad said there is in french.

There are also a good bunch of Scandinavian words in there as well, actually.   Words like 'window' and 'gay' <em>(*)</em> for a starter.    I think this really adds to the international-ness of the English language.  In a rather positive way, I might add.<br /><br />My gripes about loanwords regarding Japanese might probably be a bit due to the fact that Japanese is a very different language to the ones it usually borrows from, I think.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">Bregalad wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">I don't know how to count in Japanese (I think they use good old arabic numerals thank god - at least in games), but thanks for the advice anyways.</div><br />It's a bit of a mixed bag, really.   At eating establishments they very often list prices (esp. on strips of paper attached to the walls) using kanji numerals.   As for printed menus I find it to be mostly in Arabic numerals.<br /><br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">Bregalad wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">This is already the case today, pretty much, until the next great global language shift which will eventually happen one day when the American-controlled world will collapse and another nation will start to grow more and more important.</div><br />Even during the most, like, hardcore times of the Roman Empire way back in the days, Koine (ancient Greek) was still used as the common lingua franca in the old world (for about a good 600 years (〜300 BC - 〜300 AD).   I think that one reason for this was that Koine had already become quite widespread by the time the Roman Empire seriously started climbing the ladder.   Another reason might've been due to the, once again, widespread, culture of Greece.<br /><br />For what it's worth, I find it rather doubtsome that some other language (e.g. Chinese) can replace English anytime soon.<br /><br /><br /><br /><em>(*) 'Window' hails from 'vindauga' (lit. wind eye).  'Gay' is from 'gøy' which is one word for 'fun' or 'good time' (German: 'lüstig').  Somewhere along the line, the word 'gay' got its meaning changed to mean homo(phile) in English.</em>
