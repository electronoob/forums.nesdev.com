They usually take care of their stuff or the resellers only sell the stuff in good condition only.  The stuff sold abroad is usually the mint condition or something half mint that people wouldn't know the difference since they didn't saw how some stuff could be in good condition in the first place.<br /><br />If you go in the "junk" section, this is where you can find some loose VRC6/7 carts at 1$/2$ with may have connectors in no so great shape. So you have to look properly before buying. You can get at that price some just breed too if you search well.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3559">Banshaku</a> — Tue Jul 24, 2012 7:56 am</p><hr />

I think your righT Shiru.  Although I wonder if they designed them to be extremely difficult to open if not impossible for small kids.  US carts warn to never open on the back label and use the security screws.  I'm guessing they took this idea even further with the FC carts.<br /><br />Yeah unfortunately I had to pay quite a bit more than $1-2 for the cart.  I don't plan to play or show case it much, but it's hard to get myself to accept damage to it with what great condition it's in.  Although I'd consider converting it if someone translated it.  That and the Japanese always care for things so much more than Americans.  Things like the box and full instruction set were no surprise with this item, but they would have been rare if it were US equipment.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=4832">infiniteneslives</a> — Tue Jul 24, 2012 7:47 am</p><hr />

Honestly, I doubt these cartridge cases (also pirate Genesis) were designed to be opened. I think they were intended for one-time assembly, and if you lucky, you may take them apart a few times. I broke so much cases I can't even count, no matter how much experience with this I had.<br /><br />Genesis ones were easy to repair, at least - there were false plastic screws on the back, so you could cut them and put real screws (heat them to screw into the other side).<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=4205">Shiru</a> — Tue Jul 24, 2012 5:34 am</p><hr />

The bootgod trick with grips seems good but I never tried it.<br /><br />It may not be the answer that you're looking for but since I live in japan and getting some VRC6/7 cost almost nothing, I gave up on the fact that I may break pins while opening them. When you can get them for a 1$ or 2$, you don't mind anymore but I do understand that for most people this is not the case.<br /><br />If you use it for a dev cart you shouldn't mind about the breaking pins stuff anyway.

Digging up and oldie but a goodie apparently.<br /><br />But I got a copy of Lagrange Point today and I want to crack it open and play with it's VRC7 goodness.

I tried awhile back to open a FC cart and gave up with the conclusion I had to tear the sticker off to get at a what I thought was a hidden screw.  But apparently there is no said screw...<br /><br />All I have is a vice, might try to put some sort of protector on it to prevent scratching.  However picking up some of those clamps is probably the better choice.<br /><br />If you guys have came up with any other tips in the past couple years I'd love to hear em.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=4832">infiniteneslives</a> — Mon Jul 23, 2012 10:14 pm</p><hr />

The trick is to use Quick Grips.<br /><br />Line them up on the front cover on both sides, not top and bottom but sides. Slowly gripping it, the cart front will begin to bend upwards, its at that point you can safely use a very, very flat screwdriver or a knife blade so gently ease open the latches. I got this info from the man himself.<br /><br />Don't stick anything in the sides or you will end up scratching it all to hell or breaking a latch; an exception is the poorly made multicarts and pirate carts, they usually have easily to open cases.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3407">MatthewCallis</a> — Wed Nov 05, 2008 6:07 pm</p><hr />

I've never actually looked at a Famicon cart closely, so I have no firsthand experience, but I googled really quick and found this:<br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://detail.chiebukuro.yahoo.co.jp/qa/question_detail/q116990246">http://detail.chiebukuro.yahoo.co.jp/qa ... q116990246</a><!-- m --><br /><br />He says to take a tiny flathead screwdriver and slip it into the seam on the side of the cart.  When you have pried it open a little bit, stick another thin-bladed tool in there to prop it open (freeing your flathead screwdriver).  Then, with your tiny flathead screwdriver, "move, wait, pry".  As you do this, the crack will gradually get bigger (presumably you'd do this all the way around the cart?  though he doesn't say this specifically).  Do this carefully over and over and eventually you'll get it open.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3632">MetalSlime</a> — Wed Nov 05, 2008 5:45 am</p><hr />

I doubt that this work work, but what the heck...<br /><br />Can you heat one side of the cart with something "warm", and the other side with something cold (dry ice) (or sandwich the cart between two peltier devices appropriately configured)?  Then the plastic might warp (but not break) such that it is easier to pry apart?  Assuming, of course, that you heat the side that needs to flex, so that it doesn't get too brittle via the cold.  The cold side should contract slightly and the warm side expand.  Probably less than 1 mm though.  <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" alt=":(" title="Sad" /><br /><br />Kind ok like using the trick of holding a glass "Mason" jar under hot running water to cause the metal lid to expand slightly so that it is easier to open.  The metal expands faster than the glass (different heat transfer coefficients).<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3664">clueless</a> — Tue Nov 04, 2008 3:44 pm</p><hr />
