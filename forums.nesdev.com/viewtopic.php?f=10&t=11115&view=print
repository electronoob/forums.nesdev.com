		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />When you say you get a glitch, do you mean you get a bit of black at the top of the screen and the image is shifted down? What is the glitch?<br /><br />The vblank period after NMI is a very short time, and it is really difficult to do very much at all in C code during this time. The NMI handler in shiru's library is probably already doing a bunch of things (uploading sprites, etc.) and should have a special way of uploading nametable data during vblank. So, after it's done all that, there's probably not much time left for you to do any manual uploads of your own.<br /><br />You should only need to turn the PPU off and on manually when you are going to turn rendering off for a long time to do a lot of PPU uploading, like if you're setting up the whole screen at once.<br /><br /><br />Edit: I think what you need to use is the &quot;set_vram_update&quot; function, which you should do before ppu_waitnmi(), and your update will automatically be applied during the ppu_waitnmi() call.

I'll look at &quot;set_vram_update&quot; maybe that will work. I did notice you could use it during rendering, but it said &quot;number of transferred bytes is limited by vblank time&quot;<br /><br />the other vram functions &quot;works only when rendering is turned off&quot; according to shiru, which is why I was turning the ppu off/on.<br /><br />I'm probably trying to do things in a weird way.<br /><br />edit: added &quot;delay(20);&quot; to the loop so you could see the glitch easier. and attached the compiled .nes for anyone to test.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Oh, that's interesting. The glitch frame you are seeing is that occasionally for 1 frame you're using the wrong CHR pattern page for your nametables.<br /><br />This is controlled by <a href="http://wiki.nesdev.com/w/index.php/PPU_registers#Controller_.28.242000.29_.3E_write" class="postlink">bit 4 of the register at $2000</a>. Once every several frames your code is writing $80 instead of $90 to this register, which causes it to select the $0000 CHR page for backgrounds instead of the $1000 page you want.<br /><br />I don't know how this is being triggered, or why it doesn't happen every frame. The code is a LDA #$80, STA $2000, which I can't find in the neslib.s source <a href="http://shiru.untergrund.net/articles/programming_nes_games_in_c.htm" class="postlink">found here</a>. Maybe shiru can answer your question.<br /><br />However, the code you have written is still a problem. You should only turn the PPU off when you need to take rendering down for multiple frames so you can place a lot of data into the PPU. For an update that happens every frame, <em>do not</em> turn the PPU off, just push the data through with set_vram_update. You should be able to push at least 32 bytes per frame through there, if not more (I don't use shiru's neslib, so I can't tell you its performance limits).<br /><br /><br />Edit: oh, didn't see your comment about delay(), I was going by your pastebin source. That explains why it's not every frame at least. I expect the offending write to $2000 is in ppu_on_all, but I also think you are probably using an out of date neslib? Try using the one at shiru's page instead.

To me this looks like a bug that shiru has since corrected.<br /><br /><br />I've used cc65 a bit, and did prepare my own libraries work working with it. I don't have a tutorial or much in the way of examples to show. I've so far released one project publicly with full source, but I think you'll have an easier time with shiru's libs than trying to figure out my stuff.

If you want to do advanced things by turning the PPU off, you're not going to be doing it with the library functions.<br /><br />Actually, I'm surprised shiru didn't move the write to $2001 into the NMI instead; if ppu_on_all is called in the middle of the screen you're going to get a half rendered frame (with incorrect background scroll to boot), I think...

Personally, I prefer to not disable rendering, but I wouldn't think twice about doing if I needed a few more dozen cycles of VBlank time.
