Hello?  Bueller?   <img src="./images/smilies/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt=":roll:" title="Rolling Eyes" /></div><br />I had never seen that message board before... don't think I'll go back.  Did anyone read the comments?  What a bunch of idiots.  My favorite quote was this one:<br /><div class="quotetitle">realyst2k wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">135$ is far far far too much.<br /><br />No way in hell there's that much tech in that cart. Nor would it cost that bloody much to manufacture. Hell, there are(less elegant) DIY projects for far cheaper fer cryin' out loud.<br /><br />Lower the price, blokes, and you got a deal. Until you wake up, however, I'll stick with my NESten.<br /></div>
<br />
<br />No way there's "that much tech in that cart"?  What does that even mean?  Nobody on that board put together that the fact it took 25 years for a universal cartridge to be made was because: it's really difficult!
<br />There's so much bad information in that thread, and unfounded accusations of overpricing the powerpak, that I'm really disappointed.  Maybe the masses just aren't ready for this product.
<br />Sure it's expensive for a casual player, who's happy to play emulated games on their newer consoles.  But that's not who it's for.

<br /> obviously a "DIY" project with 64 memory mappers would cost more than $135 I have never been to that site before ether but it seems to be a community witch are not paticularley into this kind of stuff there are other forums witch there would be less jackassery
<br />
<br />Btw when someone gets there’s in let us know 
<br />Since I started placing my order during the first second it was out refreshing as soon as it appeared to do so I should be one of the first to get mine I will do so also
