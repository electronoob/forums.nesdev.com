<br />
<br />The names Drake, Im a NES video game collector and have alot of donor carts sitting around gathering dust. Ive been looking into reproduction carts for awhile now, just on games that were never released (Bio-Force Ape, Earthbound Zero, ETC).
<br />
<br />I have talked to people that sell them and they want some ridiculous prices, especially when its something I feel like I can learn to do myself. Im a computer technician full time so I feel pretty knowledgeable in tech. But ive never pursued programming eeproms. 
<br />
<br />Can anyone give me any info to get me started? I know I need a programmer, but not sure what Type kind im looking for (since im lacking in chip knowledge).
<br />
<br />Thanks everyone...

<br />
<br />I'll give you a basic rundown of the process anyway:
<br />-Find out what mapper/board the game uses;
<br />-Find a donor cart that uses the same (or very similar) mapper/board;
<br />-Remove the ROMs from the donor board and make adaptations if it's not a perfect match;
<br />-Split the ROM into PRG and CHR (not always present) sections;
<br />-Program the EPROMs/FlashROMs, replicating the files until they fill the entire chips if necessary;
<br />-Compare the pinout of the original ROM against the pinout of the EPROM/FlashROM;
<br />-Solder the EPROMs/FlashROMs, cutting traces and rewiring pins to overcome the differences identified in the previous step;
<br />-Test;
<br />
<br /><a href="http://bootgod.dyndns.org:7777/advanced.php" class="postlink">Bootgod's database</a> is great for looking up board/mapper information. <a href="http://personales.epsg.upv.es/~jogilmo1/NES/TEXTOS/ARXIUS/BOARDTABLE.TXT" class="postlink">This table</a> is useful too, but it's not as complete.
<br />
<br />Splitting the files can be done with an hex editor, but there are a couple of tools for this.
<br />
<br />You can look up the data sheet of your EPROM/FlashROM in <a href="http://www.datasheetcatalog.com/" class="postlink">this site</a> to get its pinout, and <a href="http://nesdev.com/NES%20ROM%20Pinouts.txt" class="postlink">this document</a> has the pinouts for different Nintendo ROMs. Whatever doesn't match has to be rerouted.
<br />
<br />I believe all EPROM programmers work for the common 8-bit chips that are used with the NES, so you don't have to worry too much about chip support. Make sure you get a USB programmer though, because there are still many parallel port programmers around and those are sometimes a pain to get working on modern computers.
<br />
<br />As for the EPROMs, the 27CXXX series is commonly used. The XXX represents the size of the EPROM (Note that the size is specified in KBits, not KBytes: you have to divide by 8 to convert from KBits to KBytes - 256KBits = 32KBytes). From 1024 up sometimes they use 010, 020, and so on. FlashROMs also work great on the NES, specially the 29CXXX series.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />The cheapest EPROM programmer I know of is the TOP853 (~$35 on eBay), which is okay for this purpose but requires Windows XP and has a very poor English translation in its software.
<br />
<br />If you want to reuse EPROMs you might also want an EPROM eraser (little drawer with a UV light and timer), also pretty cheap on eBay (~$20). Alternatively you can get OTP EPROMS with no erase window, and hope you get it right the first time.
<br />
<br />If the game is using a specific simple mapper, you may be able to get all new parts from <a href="http://www.retrousb.com/index.php?cPath=24" class="postlink">retrousb</a>. Currently it's charging $12 for a PCB, case, and lockout chip. In addition to this you will need a couple of capacitors (~&lt;10c each) your CHR/PRG EPROM or SRAM chips (~&lt;$5), and possible a discrete logic chip or two for the mapper (~$1). Check the <a href="http://www.retrousb.com/product_info.php?cPath=24&amp;products_id=42" class="postlink">ReproPak</a> manual for instructions.
<br />
<br />For more complicated mappers, people usually cannabalize a suitable donor cart, for which you only need to replace the PRG/CHR chips with your own EPROMS, with a little bit of creative wiring.
<br />
<br />You also need a soldering iron and solder, obviously. For donor carts you need an NES cartridge screwdriver bit. Other tools can help with removing old chips (desoldering braid, desoldering pump, dremel, etc.).

<br />
<br />Im going to start looking for a eeprom programmer and eraser. 
<br />
<br />Is using the donor eproms a good idea? I know that these chips are very old now and im not wanting to run into issues. 
<br />
<br />My other question is I have a Retron 3 for my kid, and was wondering will the repro im going to make be compatible withit (cause i know some games are not). I have the original NES hooked up in my game library but im sure he would stick some kind of lego or something in there to play lego game. 
<br />
<br />Sorry for not looking up this info before hand. I did a search and the topics were a bit overwhelming so im trying to centralize the info for me.

<br />
<br />I don't know what you mean by "donor EPROM", but the ROM chips in a donor cart are not reusable (they are hard-wired mask ROMs, not EPROM). If you mean "can I use old EPROMS I got from eBay", then the answer is "usually", but be sure to erase them first (though an EPROM programmer can tell you if it's blank before it starts programming).
<br />
<br />Compatibility should be the same as with the original game, if you did the repro correctly.
<br />
<br />Also, if you're using new parts with a ReproPak you can skip the lockout chip if you don't need it to run on an unmodded original NES (top loader and clones like Retron 3 do not normally have lockout devices).
<br />
<br />If you don't want to spend a bunch, someone else already suggested it, but the PowerPak will get you hundreds of games on one cart for a price comparable to what it will take you to set up and build your first repro.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />thanks rainwarrior. I was under the impression I could take eprom out of donor cart and clear and reflash. Guess this isnt the case. 
<br />
<br />The powerpak would be a great idea except im wanting something more than just playing these. Im wanting to be able to display them individually on my shelf (as a stand alone copy) 
<br />
<br />I actualy have a small laptop running a slimmed down version of XP SP3 so the Windows 7 compliancy isnt really a need. 
<br />
<br />I found the TOP853 for 43.00 free shipping. But thats the best ive been able to find (which isnt really that bad). 
<br />
<br />So what exactly is the donor cartridge supplying anyway? Is the repro basically just programming the rom onto an eprom and soldering into a donor board with the required circuitry to make it work? 
<br />
<br />Im also going to take this a step further, I own a website (ThumbstickGamer.com) where we do like reviews, previews and just anything to kill time, and ive been thinking about programming a game using xna. But if I can get this figured out Id love to program my own adventure and create a gamecart for a giveaway (sounds pretty sweet). But one step at a time...

<br />Yes. What complicates things a bit is when the pinouts of the chips don't match (this is always true for &gt; 32KB) and when the board isn't an exact match (so you have to do things like add RAM, rewire traces, add pins, etc.).

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Well, presumably you have an NES ROM file of Bioforce Ape and not a prototype cartridge. The pinout that matters is that of the donor board. What you need to know is which mapper Bioforce Ape uses (I believe it's MMC3, but you must verify this yourself).
<br />
<br />So, you go find a game cartridge you want to destroy that also uses that mapper. Replace its two ROM chips with your own (rewiring a few things to accomodate different pinout between their ROM chips and your EPROMS), and you'll be done.
<br />
<br />A link to pinout info was already posted. If you have an NES ROM and you want to know what mapper it uses, Nestopia will let you look at a ROM's header with an option in its file menu. This will give you an iNES mapper number which you can look up on the wiki: <a href="http://wiki.nesdev.com/w/index.php/Category:INES_Mappers" class="postlink">http://wiki.nesdev.com/w/index.php/Category:INES_Mappers</a>
<br />
<br />
<br />This site also has good information about donor boards, and will also do the job for you if you want to take the easy route: <a href="http://www.nesreproductions.com/" class="postlink">http://www.nesreproductions.com/</a>

<br />So I found out that I can use Silver Surfer as a donor cart (since I have two copies of this) and knowing how frustrating this game can be. This kinda feels good lol.
<br />
<br />I did a mapper lookup:

<br />
<br />so what all info on here is important. I see that the games have 2 chips (one for characters and stuff, another for programming)
