Thought I'd give a very quick review before plugging them in and working with Helder to see if we can tag-team crack some protection on these bad boys!<br /><br />Shipping: Decently fast. It took 2-3 days for them to actually ship out to me, but that's fine considering they're probably made to order. They were shipped priority, in a good sturdy box, wrapped in newspaper. I have no complaints here at all.<br /><br />Communication: I didn't talk with InfiniteNesLives much during this transaction, but on my first one he generally got back to me in a matter of hours. A+<br /><br />Quality: These things are really sturdy, look good, and are clean as could possibly be. He even added in a free battery for every flash cart I got. Some might consider this a given, but in all honesty, I consider it a plus. That wasn't required, and I appreciate it.<br /><br />All in all, it was a smooth purchase, fast delivery, and an all around pleasure to do business with. I've bought seven of these now, and will definitely buy more in the near future.

Emails which require more than a minute or two often pile up till I have time on the weekends to catch up on the inbox.  If you have technical questions on these boards which need addressed I recommend posting it here.  As others might be able to lend suggestions, and I can share info with everyone, not just personal emails.<br /><br />That said mango's issues are related to the CIC, so here is some info for all.  I originally designed the boards to work with jim's cool SNES CIC.  His CIC works great on NTSC consoles, and reports I got from PAL beta testers was all good.  Later on some people started experiencing issues with the cic in PAL regions.  I added support for ikari's superCIC with the non-pin compatible pic 12F629 with my second PCB revision.  That revision is now in production and any board orders in PAL regions has been receiving the superCIC as of the past couple weeks.  I'm not certain what the issue is wth jim's cool SNES cic, I'm half concerned it might be a power issue.  The SNES notoriously has a noisy supply, and it could explain why some have issues and others not.  I'm working on obtaining a PAL SNES which has the issues so I can debug the issue, but that hasn't been an expeditious process to say the least.  So the superCIC saves the day for our PAL friends for now. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />

I tried padding and still messes up in the same spot, give or take 5 seconds. Though would those files need to be mirrored? One already fills the whole board.

I've flashed FF3 using both the firmware linked on INL's site and Danin's new firmware and obtained identical results.

The <em>firmware</em> won't fix crash issues, as the writes are handled the same for the most part. The host app may make some difference. Which release of my host app are you using? What are you using to apply the patch that you mentioned? It shouldn't be a HiROM <em>mapping</em> issue, in theory, since it's a 4MByte Rom on a 4MByte cart, but do make sure you flipped the top switch to HiROM position.<br /><br />I'm at work right now so I can't do too much testing for you, but if you provide that info, I'll do some checking when I get home (around 5:45pm MST) and get back with you on my results. A common issue seems to be cart centering - see the info in my host app thread for proper positioning (in the Quick Usage section) when inserting it into the Kazzo, since the socket and cart aren't perfect matches.<br /><br />The main issue I have with getting you an answer right away is that I have not received a 4MByte board to test HiROM with, hopefully that will happen soon. Try to test several Roms that're LoROM and several that are HiROM, and let me know if the HiROM ones all fail, or which ones work and which fail (and what size they are, <em>specificaly Rom Size as listed in the host app</em>) and I'll see what I can figure out on my end. Also, if a Rom fails, try without &quot;Auto-Fix Protection&quot; and see if that changes things...it's fairly safe, but there's a tiny chance that could cause issues.
