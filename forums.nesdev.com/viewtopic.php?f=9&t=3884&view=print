<br />
<br />Bunnyboy, if you are reading this, could you tell us how PowerPak production is going?  Will it be on sale again this year?

<br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">Is there some way I can buy a PowerPak without a CF card and reader? I already have those and $130+ is a pretty steep price, even for a great product. Hope you'll understand; thanks.</div><br />And this <a href="http://nesdev.com/bbs/viewtopic.php?t=3837" class="postlink">thread</a> from January 18, 2008:<br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">Hi! I recently bought a PowerPak with a 128MB CF card. I'm using a Pal nes with the region free mod. The card works using the 128MB CF.</div>
<br />I think the PowerPak may had been "temporarily unavailable" since during November 2007 - January 2008 - although I remember the PowerPak being out of stock during the Christmas season.  So I guess the PowerPak was out of stock for around 1-3 months?

You could also send him an email letting him know you're interested I guess. He's the only one that would know when more will be available.

<br />Since neither PowerPak description page tells of any estimate, this may mean that bunnyboy isn't too sure when the PowerPak will be on sale again.  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" alt=":(" title="Sad" />

<br />I sort of doubt that NOA threatened bunnyboy.  I think it would make sense that other products (PowerPak Lite, USB CopyNES, ReproPak and its parts, etc.) - or even the RetroUSB site itself - would be unavailable should NOA have threatened bunnyboy's company.

<br />
<br />The PowerPak got off to such a good start, but development on mappers and hardware availability seems to have stalled.  He implied that there would eventually be working MMC5 support... 
<br />
<br />I would certainly pick up a spare PowerPak if they were available again.

<br />
<br />I would love to be able to test some home brew on it.  I didn't saw anything similar for the famicom except I remember vaguely some company, neo something, that was supposed to make one for it. Maybe I didn't search enough?

<br />Yes, neoflash is working on a programmable NES cart. I wouldn't hold my breath though, as they take forever to get anything finished (if they ever finish it).
