Ok, so I finally have the correct SF7/PC setup. I managed to stumble upon a great find on eBay the other day. I bought an IBM Thinkpad 560 for $13 with an external floppy drive and PCMCIA CD-ROM drive. There was also a Dell NIC included that I got working. The only thing that doesn't work is the battery, but that's to be expected considering it's over a decade old. I could purchase a battery online, but I am weighing out the advantages of having one and the disadvantages of not having one.<br /><br />The 560 is running Windows 98 SE fairly well and I can transfer SNES games to my SF7 using the SF6 transfer protocol. I remember with my old desktop, I couldn't get the SF6 protocol working. I was using the SF3 protocol and it kept giving wrong file size errors when transferring. Another plus side of the laptop is that I now have a dedicated developer machine for my SNES.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3995">pcmantinker</a> â€” Mon Aug 31, 2009 9:04 pm</p><hr />
