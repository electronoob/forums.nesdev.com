I have made about 30 games so far.<br />I have a 100% success-rate with sl-rom, tl-rom, nrom. My problem comes whenever a board uses chr-ram. Boards like un-rom and sn-rom. <br />I have a 100% fail-rate with every game that uses chr-ram so i have just come to the conclusion that i am doing something wrong and i can not figure it out.  I use <br />a hakko fr-300 to desolder the PRG maskrom. I have tried games both with and without patching and they never work. <br /><br />I use 27c2001 eproms. And wire them like this. <br /><br />SN-ROM (bending up pin 1,2,24,30,31)<br />hole 1 -&gt; pin 30<br />hole 24 -&gt; pin 2<br />pin 24 -&gt; pin 16 (ground)<br /><br />TN-ROM (Bending up pin 1,2,24,30,31)<br />hole 1 -&gt; pin 30<br />hole 2 -&gt; pin 31<br />hole 24 -&gt; pin 2<br />pin 24 -&gt; pin 16 (ground)<br /><br />SU-ROM (Bending up pin 1,2,24,30,31)<br />hole 1 -&gt; pin 30<br />hole 24 -&gt; pin 2<br />pin 24 -&gt; pin 16 (ground)<br /><br />Here are some pictures of some of the japanese carts i atempted to translate. <br /><br />Dragon Warrior 3 on Dragon Quest 4 board (SU-ROM)<br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://ibb.co/gbPx4v">https://ibb.co/gbPx4v</a><!-- m --><br />Final Fantasy 1 (japanese rom with english patch) on original FF1 board (SN-ROM)<br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://ibb.co/bDHvra">https://ibb.co/bDHvra</a><!-- m --><br />Final Fantasy 2 (japanese rom with no patch) on original FF2 board (SN-ROM)<br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://ibb.co/gWG5ra">https://ibb.co/gWG5ra</a><!-- m --><br />Final Fantasy 3 (Japanese rom with english patch) on original FF3 board (TN-ROM)<br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://ibb.co/hZXOcF">https://ibb.co/hZXOcF</a><!-- m --><br /><br />I have used famirom to export the rom 1mb for use with my 27c2001 as i have done with all other (working) games. <br />All of the 4 samples above give a solid grey screen. I resoldered the original maskrom to the &quot;final fantasy 3&quot; board and that<br />worked fine so the board seems fine. <br /><br />I have searched the forum and the rest of the web and i have drawn a blank. What am i doing wrong?<br />Is there any Nes/famicom wizard that knows the secret?

Yea that is probably true but i have a realy hard time with Morse. I can not differentiate the shorts from the longs so i would be looking up morsecode<br />blindly. So i really appreciate the help. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" /> <br />I have also not found any chart that tells me the meaning of the two letters. I could not find that in the readme that comes with the holydiverbatman rom. <br /><br />When i split the rom i just use famiROM and set it to create a 1 meg file that fits my 27c2001. famiROM does not have an option to strip the header so<br />that might be my problem. It has not caused problems with any &quot;non&quot; chr-ram game so i never thought about that. Would you recommend another<br />program to split the rom and create the prg.bin file?
