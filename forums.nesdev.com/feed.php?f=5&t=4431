Instead of outright "removing" Win2K support, why didn't ATi just add an OS check that pops up a warning dialog, stating that the drivers are untested/unsupported and any problems you encounter are entirely your fault? Do you think maybe MS "convinced" them to drop support, in their own devious little way...?<br /></div><br />I wouldn't be surprised if MS payed some companies to get things uncompatible with Win2k. Not that long ago, Win98 was the standard and I was one of the only to have the brand new Win2k.<br /><br />Righ now, Win XP is the standard and I'm the only one to still have the "old" Win2k altough I don't consider it old at all, I guess I'll keep using Win2k for at least 10 years, I don't buy new software anyway I just download it. I dobt any tools to make console games will be made unavailable for 2k on purpose, and if newer Firefox updates aren't compatible with win2k I'll keep using the last version that is. It's true it would be a shame not being able to play newer PC games, but there is still lots of old PC games available arround.<br /><br />And I'm suprised everyone tells that XP is that stable, beacuse on the my dad's machine where he installed XP I used before getting my own new computer (and still ocasionally use), it was really slow and often crashed. It seemed it was common that Windows woud "freeze" for 10 seconds not reacing to any key presses or mouses clicks. I never seen such a thing on 2k. And 2k is the only Windows along with 3.1 never crashed a single time for me.<br /><br />I have Linux installed at scool and it looks 99% like Windows, depsite what everyone says. There really isn't much differences at all.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"><br />Unlike Windows, "Add/Remove Programs" on Ubuntu can actually add programs.

However, I just can't seem understand such basic things of Linux, like installing a device driver.

Strange reply, Bregalad, because everyone I know — including myself — say that XP is far more stable than anything (from Microsoft), except Vista which is for the moment a bit heavy, and Win2K as the worst OS ever. Bah i don't know win 2K, but I never saw a bluescreen on XP (except those by a special screen saver that display them <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" /><p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=336">Jarhmander</a> — Tue Oct 07, 2008 4:00 pm</p><hr />

<div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"><br />I use ClamWin, setting it to scan everything weekly.<br /></div><br />Yes I also use it but it's always trying to update it's database on each boot even when internet is not present which is annoying. Aside of that it's a great AV that doesn't annoy too much like Avast does (and I uninstalled it). At least it does't make a red alert for YY-CHR.<br /><br />And yes it's true that most machines with Windows are getting regularly slower. I don't know why at all, but it often is. I don't want to reinstall the whole system regularly. I avoid putting anything important on C: (I have mostly programms I can re-download or re-install), but some programms like Eclips almost requires you to put your files in the same directory as the programm.<br /><br />Also I'm proud and glad to have Win2k. XP is too slow and often crashes (don't know why it got that much popular), while Vista is plain terrible I've heard. 98 also crashes all the time, 95 and older can't browse the web.<br />Only Win NT4 and Win2k are left, and 2k is the most recent of them. I'd say it's my favourite OS ever, and I don't care what anyone says (95 were great back then too).<br />If it's getting really too old one day I'll switch to Ubuntu, but it is not as good when it comes to drivers and you always have to download pieces of programms I've hard.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"><br />I HATE fixing! Once I worked in support, and I simply hated it. Also, when you study computer science, all your friends and family seem to think you know everything about computers, and will ask you all kinds of favors, including fixing extremely bogged down PCs...!<br /></div><br />At least I can be glad that I've decided to study electronics instead (and take computers science courses as well). But when people gives you broken devices and expect you to repair them it's not way better.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=38">Bregalad</a> — Tue Oct 07, 2008 12:00 pm</p><hr />

It takes hours to accomplish the most basic tasks.<br /></div><br /><br />Man, this is a pet peeve of mine. I finally got to the point where I just tell family members and friends that I have no clue how to fix *insert problem that isn't really a problem here*. It's so hard to try and tell someone how to do stuff over the phone, so I just end up saying I don't know what to do for them. Kind of a cop-out, but when you actually do help people, they keep calling back WAY too often for the stupidest, most simple things. It gets to be too much of a chore when it really shouldn't be.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=174">Roth</a> — Tue Oct 07, 2008 8:50 am</p><hr />
