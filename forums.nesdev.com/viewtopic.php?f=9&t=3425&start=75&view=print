		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Both Goodnes v3.10 dumps of Micro Machines are right, their CRCs correspond with bootgod's.  However, as I can attest, Camerica/Codemaster's games are really finicky when it comes to NTSC.  In Quatro Sports, the Baseball game flickers wildly on one of my TVs and not at all on another TV!  (This is using a true Aladdin Deck Enhancer, either with a NES or Famicom AV.)

<br />
<br />All Codemasters games, except for the Quattro 4-in-1s use mapper 71.  According to kevtris, the only difference between UNROM and BF9093 games is the address range that operate the lockout defeater.
<br />
<br />Firehawk is assigned mapper 71, but like Karnov and Low-G-Man, I think it needs its own mapper.  Mapper 71 is has hardwired mirroring.  Firehawk uses one-screen mirroring, like the A*ROM series.  A*ROM would not work with it because one of its 16KB banks is fixed.  
<br />
<br />Karnov has a similar problem.  Its mirroring is hardwired, but the standard mapper 4 designates mirroring as mapper controlled.  I think by emulating the register that switches the mirroring, Karnov gets broken.  
<br />
<br />As for Low-G-Man, it suffers from needing an open bus on addresses where quite a few other games expect RAM.  iNES is too limited to deal with this in mapper 4, so a new mapper is needed.

<br />
<br />However I tested the Micro Machines rom from the GoodSet and it goes crazy on my PowerPak while my own dump works... which led me to believe that the rom in the goodset is bad.

<br />It depends. Does the game write to WRAM? If you have it, run it in FCE Ultra and set a write breakpoint on $6000-$7FFF.

Attempting to change the characters usually crashes the BIOS and gives a card failure error upon reset.<br /><br />I'm assuming that proper register/RAM initialization in the BIOS would solve these problems?</div>I know the cause of this problem.  The BIOS is not setting the stack pointer on reset.  Certain games can have the stack pointer set to point to a lower portion of the stack page ($0100-01FF), which will mess up the boot ROM.  GameGenie codes, for example, start at RAM address $0110 and run through $0137.  If the stack pointer were in this range, the GG codes will be corrupted and trying to change them will crash the boot ROM (due to the stack collision).
