The text color actually isn't changed, the color emphasis it.<br />However, I got a better idea. When I'm able to change the $2006 adress (so at the top of a non-space tile and at the bottom of the space tiles), I'll change the color and keep the emphasis solid. When I'm not able to change the $2006 palette because it would require some $2005 writes, I'll only change the emphasis on $2001. So the bottom part of the letters may look to change. If it really looks to strange, I may try to compensate this with palette (or to simply not use emphasis bits).<br />I think glitches at the right will be less visible if I make the box smaller, letting 2 blank tiles to the right boxrder instead of just one.<br /><br />EDIT : I now uploaded a new version that looks way better, but still has several glitches. If anyone has improvement ideas, please tell me !<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=38">Bregalad</a> — Sun Feb 05, 2006 9:22 am</p><hr />

It's nice that you got to make a demo of it. I think it looks OK, but why do the text and the borders get the color changed too? If only the background changed it would be nicer. It looks somewhat glitchy with the "white" color also changing. The right side is pretty glitchy, as expected. I can't think of a way for the player to ignore that. You can't just make the text box smaller and cover the rest with sprites 'cause they're disabled too, right?<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=95">tokumaru</a> — Sun Feb 05, 2006 8:48 am</p><hr />

Oh my god.... Dish I wouldn't be able to do a such developpement on my own. Plus time to turn off $2001 and turn it back later, I think glitches are unavoidable.<br />Also, in PAL, a CPU clock is 3.2 pixels and not 3, so this leves even less time for HBlank (or am I wrong ?).<br />Now, what kind of glitches would happen ? Turning the rendering off will render the background color, but then set $2006 during the right border time before the actual HBlank, what kind of effect could it have ?<br />By written only to $2006, the only flaw is that fine H scroll cannot be set, and that fine V scroll can only be between 0 and 3 (bit 2 always clear), right ? If so I think I could work with it.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=38">Bregalad</a> — Sun Jan 29, 2006 1:25 am</p><hr />

You seem to forget that you HAVE TO turn off rendering completely by writing $2001 for writes to $2007. Otherwise, the palette color won't be set. (trust me on this one, I tried to make a work-around 5 years ago in all ways I could imagine)<br /><br />One of the problems you mention is indeed that you cannot get in perfect sync with the PPU on the NES like you can on a C-64. (where you can write the *exact* pixel location at every frame) The only way I've found out to get a minimal phase error is to time all your code from start of vblank to the beginning of the effect, and make sure the next vblank will end with a bunch of NOPs. <br /><br />That still leaves you with a cycle off though. Maybe it's doable if you manage to have a last "sta zero-page" instruction after a final NOP and time your code so that NMI would either occur directly before it (i.e., after the last NOP) or always one cycle inside of it. Then you could check the zero-page variable inside the NMI and skip 2 cycles in the timed code if the write was sucessful. I think I tried something like this once, but for some reason wasn't able to get it working without glitches.<p>Statistics: Posted by Guest — Sat Jan 28, 2006 4:14 pm</p><hr />

Assuming you want to avoid all graphical glitches... this means the earliest you can start messing with the PPU address is just after it increments the Y scroll (PPU cycle 257 on the scanline).  You must also finish and have the scroll values reset before it begins fetching bytes for the next scanline (cycle 320 -- meaning you must be done by 319)  This leaves you a window of 62 PPU cycles -- or roughly 20 CPU cycles.<br /><br />Now note that you only have 20 CPU cycles if you happen to hit HBlank at EXACTLY the right time --- which typically won't be the case, since the last CPU instruction might have left you 1 cycle into HBlank.  So to be safe you should probably only work around having have 18 cycles or less -- depending on the length of the instructions you use.  But for this, let's just say you have 18.<br /><br />that gives you time for 4 writes (STA,STX,STY absolute are 4 cycles).. and I guess 1 load (LDA,LDX or LDY immediate for the final 2 cycles).  If you have A,X,Y all set up with what you want to have written before HBlank, you may be able to take advantage of all these writes.<br /><br />Now, you'll want the last 2 writes to be resetting the scroll -- so that means you're stuck with the last 2 writes being $2006 writes.  Which I guess would make the write before that your palette write (to $2007).  Making this stunt just BARELY possible... with a minor problem:<br /><br />Fine Y scroll will be lost, since you can't set it with just $2006 writes alone, and you don't have time to alternate $2005/$2006 writes to set it properly.    This means that you won't be able to change a palette color on every scanline -- but only on half of them (the ones where the fine Y scroll for the next scanline would be less than 4)<br /><br /><br />Now note that only the second $2006 write needs to come after PPU cycle 257 (since that's the only one that changes the PPU address directly).  The first can come a little earlier.  In the end, you'll probably want something like this:<br /><br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">LDX #desired_scroll_high<br />LDY #desired_scroll_low<br />LDA #$3F<br />STA $2006   ;  note - key time 1 .. see below.<br />LDA #palette_address_you_want_to_change<br />STA $2006   ;  note - key time 2 .. see below.  HBlank starts now<br />LDA #desired_color<br />STA $2007<br />STX $2006<br />STY $2006<br />; end HBlank<br /></div><br /><br />The Key time 1 (that first $2006 write) can be dangerous depending on the H scroll of the screen.  At this time (before HBlank starts), the PPU is still fetching/rendering tiles, and in the process of doing so, is incrementing the PPU address by 1 every 8 PPU cycles.  This wouldn't be a problem, except that if it increments the address so that the low 5 bits wrap from $xx1F, it will reload bit 10 from the temp PPU address -- which this write is changing.  If this write rubs that bit the wrong way, it's okay as long as only the last fetched tile is affected (since it's never rendered to the screen).  If you mess up the tile before that you could have up to 7 distored pixels on the right side... the tile before that = up to 15 pixels.  And so on.  Now in this case... "distorted" only means they could be loaded from the wrong nametable ($2400 instead of $2000 ... or $2C00 instead of $2800).  So if you have both nametables containing the same tile for this part of the screen (or more simply, if you have horizontal mirroring), this problem will be avoided altogether.<br /><br />The Key time 2 (that second $2006 write) is what's most important.  HBlank (scanline cycle 257) must hit BEFORE the final cycle of that instruction (the write cycle).  If not, you risk distorting the next scanline (and possibly the rest of the frame).<br /><br /><br />Of course the hardest part of all this (and wouldn't you know it... the part I didn't cover ;P )  is actually FINDING HBlank with any degree of accuracy.  IRQs are slow and coarse -- and could leave you up to 7 or so cycles off (chopping your slim-but-doable 18 available cycles down to a don't-even-bother 12 cycles).  Sprite 0 hit might be good enough since BIT is moderately quick (4 cycles) -- but with a 4 cycle error you'd only have about 15 cycles (and if you count the cycles in my code above, you'll see I need AT LEAST 15 cycles for it to work -- so this could be very dangerous)<br /><br /><br />EDIT -- also note that this is all theoretical.  As has been said this just flat out might not work on the real system.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=33">Disch</a> — Sat Jan 28, 2006 2:49 pm</p><hr />

As much as we'd like to compare the NES to other systems, it is not a 2600 nor a C-64, and thanks to the braindead palette architecture, you can't do these neat raster bar effects without paying a huge price for it. <br /><br />I've tried a lot of effects based on changing the palette at each hblank and have come to the conclusion that they are useless for most (though not all) practical purposes. One reason is the large number of cycles you need to dedicate to turning rendering off and back on again and restoring the scroll values, meaning you will be able to change at most one or two colors in the palette before you will get a very noticable artifact at the right edge of your screen since the PPU will not output BG0 when you point $2006 at $3Fxx, but rather the color $2006 points to. (this is AFTER applying insane amounts of optimization scheduling and self-modifying code)<br /><br />But the biggest reason is that turning rendering off in hblank will effectively kill all sprites on the next scanline. The 2-bit color tiles and 16x16 palette selection is quite limiting when doing NES graphics, and the best way of getting a bit more color out of your pictures is to overlay sprites on BG like all good game makers did back in the days. Throwing away that oppurtunity to be able to change at most 2 BG colors per scanline just doesn't make sense for most purposes.<br /><br />And last but not least, don't even think about trying to pull these tricks off unless you're testing it on the real deal. The glitches from turning off rendering and writing $2007 in hblank is the least supported "feature" in emulators.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=106">Bananmos</a> — Sat Jan 28, 2006 2:17 pm</p><hr />

Yeah, I'm very confusing about tricky HBlank and scanline timing. I think there is people with more tricky scanline experience out there.<br />Help would be greetly apprecied.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=38">Bregalad</a> — Sat Jan 28, 2006 1:50 pm</p><hr />
