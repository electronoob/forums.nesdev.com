Interesting indeed. Would make a nice simple game.<br /><br />Have you tried the idea with a prototype? That would help checking the design and mechanics, for example defining movement speeds, timings, scoring etc.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=6401">tsone</a> — Sun Jan 04, 2015 10:04 pm</p><hr />

Interesting design document. Do you plan on coding this yourself, or are you seeking a coder for a collaboration?<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=9">tepples</a> — Sun Jan 04, 2015 9:09 am</p><hr />

<img src="http://i48.photobucket.com/albums/f246/finaltheorygames/KING1_zps7c0e3138.jpg" alt="Image" /><br /><br />In King of Prides you control a territory of land that your own pride resides on. They can't venture on beyond this land. Your job in this survival game is to play the role of an adult male lion who wants to remain king of his pride. However, not everyone around wants you to be king. There are rival males which come in at random and try a take over as well as hyenas who will steal and eat your cubs. <br /><br /><img src="http://i48.photobucket.com/albums/f246/finaltheorygames/KING2_zps06b9f466.jpg" alt="Image" /><br /><br />Even though your family is stuck within the boarders of your territory you can venture out beyond your homeland and go anywhere on screen. Your job is to fight and protect your pride family at all costs because if you loose your pride you loose the game. <br /><br /><img src="http://i48.photobucket.com/albums/f246/finaltheorygames/KING4_zps09ff8405.jpg" alt="Image" /><br /><br />The controls are simple. You can run and you can attack. There is no life bar, but instead your pride depends on your cubs. If you don't have any new cubs then you family growth stops and eventually family members die off as they get older. So your cubs are really your life bar here. <br /><br />So how do you get new cubs, well through mating of course. A female lion will produce new cubs but only when she is in heat. Only during this special time can you mate with her and produce new offspring. <br /><br />The offspring can either be male or female and when they are first born you can't tell them apart. Only after they have been around a little while can you start to tell. The male lion cub will eventually how signs of the beginnings of a mane. It is during this time period in which you must run over to the adolescent male and hit the attack button once on him to sent him off away from your pride. If a new male cub grows up to be an adult in your own pride he will then fight you for your kingly position. So send him away when he is not a threat yet. <br /><br /><img src="http://i48.photobucket.com/albums/f246/finaltheorygames/KING5_zps6de48004.jpg" alt="Image" /><br /><br />It's great to see your family grow with the addition of new cubs, but watch out for those pesky hyenas who eat them! Hyenas will come to your pride looking for easy meals and your cubs are a nice appetizer for them. Run over to a hyena and hit the attack button to make them go away. <br /><br /><img src="http://i48.photobucket.com/albums/f246/finaltheorygames/KING6_zpsb03c6ce3.jpg" alt="Image" /><br /><br />Female lions age as time goes by. They first start out as cubs but then grow older and older. You only have so many chances to mate with them before they become senior citizens so seize the opportunity by getting lucky with them when they are in heat. When lions get really old they die and a skull can be shown to signify that. <br /><br /><img src="http://i48.photobucket.com/albums/f246/finaltheorygames/KING7_zps987e1ce0.jpg" alt="Image" /><br /><br />Pieces of food randomly show up on the ground from other kills around your territory. Eat these to gain speed and strength so you can provide for your pride even better! Power up with the lean taste of BEEF!<br /><br />Score points by getting rid of the bad guys and growing your family pride. Last as long as you can, but beware that the enemies only increase in number the longer you are king of the jungle!<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=6785">Erockbrox</a> — Sun Jan 04, 2015 8:59 am</p><hr />
