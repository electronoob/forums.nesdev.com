However,  the trick is to overwrite some code with the fake IPL loader instead.  In this case,  to Address 0x1338, upload the following data bytes. 0xCD, 0x80, 0xC9, 0xF1, 0x00, 0x3F, 0xC0, 0xFF,  then set port 1 to 0, and increment port 0 by 2.  This regains you full control of the APU, for this driver.  To start the upload procedure, write 0xFF to port 1, wait for 0xAABB on port 0.<br /><br />Finally, some games, like blazeon, don 't have any new data upload procedures at all, as All of the songs needed by the game are already part of the APU ram.  In that case, you have to manually patch in some code before uploading the spc, otherwise, no amount of port manipulation will get you back to IPL.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3535">caitsith2</a> — Fri Mar 26, 2010 4:15 am</p><hr />

From what I understood so far you have to program the SPC file (which is a program) to not just play a song but also listen on several ports in order to know that it has to do something if there is data on one of them. In loadspc.asm there are two sections that I think are SPC codes, namely spc700_init_code and spc700_fasl_code. So you'd have to extend them so they listen to changes on the four ports?<br />How would a custom loader look like? Wouldn't it use a similar way since otherwise control over the SPC700 ist lost?<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=4121">AndiNo</a> — Fri Mar 26, 2010 3:39 am</p><hr />

Yehawww it works <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":-D" title="Very Happy" /><br />I think after the code change you proposed it was my fault that it didn't work. The wlalink in the SDK has the additional option of discarding unnecessary data that isn't used. This option was enabled and removed the included SPC from the bank 2 and 3. I saw that already some hours ago, but I didn't realize that an error popped up while linking and I didn't notice my batch file didn't create a new SMC as the old one was still there and so I thought that was the wrong way. But disabling this option and removing some "EmptyHandler" stuff from the header.asm made the linking work. So now I have music playing in my SNES app <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":-D" title="Very Happy" /><br />Thanks for your support all day long! <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />Now let's come back to that SPC commands while it already plays music...  <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_lol.gif" alt=":lol:" title="Laughing" /><p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=4121">AndiNo</a> — Thu Mar 25, 2010 2:58 pm</p><hr />

There should only be one slot per bank.

I've tried compiling the program with the header.asm from your spc player. I had to add<div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">  SLOT 1 $0 $2000<br />  SLOT 2 $2000 $E000<br />  SLOT 3 $0 $10000<br /></div> to .MEMORYMAP otherwise the SDKs WLA complains about not defined slots. But there's still only zeros at address 0x10000 in the SMC file. Am I still missing something or might that be a fault of the SDKs WLA (which is a modified WLA)?<br />edit: WLALINK seems to always use 8 rom banks as it prints the message "OBTAIN_ROMBANKS: Using the biggest selected amount of ROM banks ( 8 )." when linking.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=4121">AndiNo</a> — Thu Mar 25, 2010 12:10 pm</p><hr />

Well, I think that the stuff at the end of your trace is actually the while-loop in your main(), but I can't say for sure.<br /><br />Anyway, the fact that you don't hear any music could mean e.g. that you're uploading the wrong data to the SPC. My loading code relies on a LOROM configuration, with the .SPC data being located in banks 1, 2 and 3 (this could be changed by altering SPC_DATA_BANK and SPC_REG_ADDR in loadspc.asm). Take a look at your .SMC file in a hex editor and make sure that the data starting at offset 0x10000 in the .SMC matches the data starting at offset 0x100 in the .SPC file. And the data at 0xC000 in the .SMC should match the data at 0x10100 in the .SPC.<br /><br />You can also use the memory editor in BSNES' debugger to look at the S-APU RAM to see if the correct data has been uploaded to it.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=1181">mic_</a> — Thu Mar 25, 2010 9:41 am</p><hr />
