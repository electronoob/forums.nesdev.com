<br />Yeah, I would have liked if you could use the most accurate emulator for some testing but I will have to live with it. Maybe it's time to optimize their code for weaker cpu then? <img src="./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" />

<br />@Bregalad
<br />
<br />If it was just me, I would have bought a Lenovo thinkpad X201s but that didn't pass in my budget (1700$). It's bigger than a netbook but almost the same weight (!).  Or I could have gone with a second hand X61 but portable breaks more easily than PC so I didn't do so. The X61 runs all emulators pretty well and can even run a VM with Win7 so it's not so shabby.
<br />
<br />For now I should see the good side: I can now work on my projects. That's already a big + compared to before when I couldn't do anything. Now I need to decide on which project I will focus.

<br />- Without NSTC filter and size at 1x, you can run at 60fps
<br />
<br />[Nintendulator]
<br />- If you set raster on, you can go up to 50 fps but still glitch.  Removing the song sometime make it faster.  
<br />
<br />[FCEABCEF]
<br />- 1.07 (SP?) works fine
<br />- 2.1.1 was working fine but now glitch. Don't know the cause yet (not connected to AC?). Same thing for 2.1.0
<br />
<br />[VirtualNes]
<br />- Works fine and fast. You can put screen in 2x and no issue.
<br />
<br />So depending what you do that can be more than enough. I will do more testing when I have a chance.
<br />
<br />Oh, and by the way, I can run VS2008 on it so it's not that bad after all.
