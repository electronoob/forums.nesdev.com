		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I recently bought a <a href="http://eng.supercard.sc/manual/mini_sd.htm" class="postlink">SuperCard MiniSD</a> for use with my GBA systems (I got an EZ-Flash 3in1 for my DS) and was a bit disappointed with the fact that I have to patch ROMs in order for them to work on that device (IIRC, the EZ-Flash doesn't need any patching - I haven't used it in a while). Being used to high quality products like bunnyboy's PowerPaks or Krikzz's Everdrives, which keep things as authentic as possible, this bothers me a lot.<br /><br />My goal is not just to &quot;play games on the go&quot;, if it was I'd be satisfied with the GBA emulator in my Android phone, which runs perfectly fine. I want things to remain authentic, specially if I decide to run homebrew software on my Flash carts, so I was wondering if anyone here knows what kind of modifications the SuperCard or similar products make to the ROMs, and how they affect the software. Can they break the ROMs in any way? Introduce glitches not present in the original ROMs? Thanks.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I own a SuperCard CF version, and haven't noticed any issues. IIRC, the patching is done at least in part to allow things like realtime saving, which I assume that it does by installing its own interrupt handler that does whatever it needs to do and then calls the original handler. Last time I used the PC tool, I think it would look up the ROMs in some kind of database to know how to patch the them. If no match was found - e.g. if I added my own techdemos - it would say something like &quot;Patching failed&quot; and supposedly not modify the ROM.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />The GBA has its own counterpart to Super NES fast and slow ROM, the <a href="http://nocash.emubase.de/gbatek.htm#gbasystemcontrol" class="postlink">WAITCNT register</a>. The system boots in slow ROM mode; most games switch to fast ROM early on. (There's also a super-fast mode that some advanced flash adapters support to diminish slowdown in some games; my memtestARM app for DS tests stability in this mode.) But the SuperCard's RAM controller isn't fast enough for fast ROM. Patching does four things: it disables fast ROM, it enables instruction prefetch (which sort of makes up for it), it mapper-hacks the save code to use SRAM instead of Bandai-style EEPROM or parallel flash, and it adds a keypress code to return to the adapter's menu (like a PowerPak long reset, except the GBA has no reset button). Most homebrew games and multiboot games will run fine without patching because they don't enable fast ROM and if they do save, it's to SRAM.

Don't touch WAITCNT and your program will work fine on a SuperCard. For inner loops, you can always copy code to the built-in ultra-fast IWRAM. You will have to quick power cycle to save though.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />The SuperCard is a let down for GBA. I owned one before. As you noticed, basically all games must be patched due to the Slow RAM (or Memory Controller) in the product not being able to keep up with *normal* ROM speeds. The pre-fetch does not make up for this. Games that normally don't suffer slowdown will. Some games suffer terrible slowdowns. The SuperCard is more useful for playing NDS games. I recommend if you can find one, one of the M3 Adapters. While any GBA device requires patching the ROMs if they use something other than SRAM it's not a bit deal. SuperCard's the one that *really* requires patching not just for saving but for not crashing when the RAM can't keep up. <br /><br />I'd highly recommend trying to find another product.

It just acts as if it were a raw NAND needing a software controller, like a SmartMedia or xD-Picture card as opposed to CF or SD. Only NOR flash is word-addressed in the way that allows for the sort of execute-in-place operation needed to run programs without copying them to RAM first. Most cards that are 512 Mbit or smaller are NOR based.
