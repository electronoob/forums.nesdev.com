This is apparently due to a CRC check present in most arcade roms.<br /><br />Unfortunately I havent had much luck disabling said check. it is a bit beyond my skill level at this point.<br /><br />I could be wrong about this, this is just what I have been told by the ASM/ROM hacker trying to help me out.</div>
<br />
<br />It may be possible that the game expects both guns and is failing a system check routine because they are not both present, or is lacking some important piece of hardware that it expects from the Vs logic design or the Gun Kit. 
<br />
<br />I think that the Vs arcade will generate an error and refuse to load if both guns are not present upon booting. 
<br />
<br />If you can check with both guns plugged-in, see if it still freezes. I'd be curious to know the result.

<br />
<br />The gun games do have an alarm, but it is not a check for multiple guns.  From the schematics, I believe it checks to see if Player1 Up is enabled all the time.  You could try keeping Up held down to see if that fixes the Alarm sound.  You would want to do this as soon as you can.  Then modify the game for that check.
<br />
<br />The graphic glitches could be because you don't have the mapper hooked up correctly.  Most Vs. games use one of the output pins of the 2A03 to switch the CHR banks.  Also, there is no CRC check on Duck Hunt.

<br />Bingo, holding up fixes the alarm sound. Now its just a matter of finding and disabling that check.

<br />
<br />If you do that, a simpler way to do the free play would be to do something similar.  Duck Hunt checks the dip switches to see if they are enabled for Free Play.  Just make the game code returns that they are.

<br />Look at them in a tile viewer to see what's CHR and what's PRG, then glue the files together in a hex editor, and slap on an iNES header.  Don't forget to set the VS bit in the header, and possibly set it as Mapper 99.

<br />The .1x files are prg rom and the .2x files are chr rom files.
<br />
<br />they have to be merged. If you run windows use the command prompt and do the following (assuming the file names are mds-sm4.*):
<br />
<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">copy /b mds-sm4.1d+mds-sm4.1c+mds-sm4.1b+mds-sm4.1a mds-sm4.prg</div><br /><br />THen, do the same for the chr<br /><br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">copy /b mds-sm4.2b+mds-sm4.2a mds-sm4.chr</div>
<br />
<br />make sure you do them in that order, notice the file extensions go in reverse alphabetical order. 
<br />
<br />then use a utility like TNINES to merge the chr, prg and hdr file I gave you into an .nes file

<br />
<br />that I don't know. it might check the rom size against the reported size in the header and tell you if there is an error but I'm not sure. As far as I'm concerned I just use it to make sure they're merged correctly.
