But unlike the other channels, I can't figure out where this overall height is coming from. The noise channel is supposed to pseudo-randomly jump between a bunch of possible frequences, isn't it?<br /><br />I also see noise channel is given values in things like famitracker.<br /><br />So the question: are these values even notes, or just presences of those frequencies that are internal to the chip?

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />The noise pattern loops. If it loops slowly (&quot;periodic&quot; mode off) you get a repetitive whoosh noise, if it loops fast enough (periodic mode on) you get a tone.<br /><br />The frequency of the tone produced just depends on the length of the loop; with the periodic mode on it's 93 samples long at whatever the current noise frequency is. You can think of it like a wavetable tone, like with N163 or FDS expansion audio. The actual waveform in periodic mode depends on whatever bits were in the LFSR when that mode was turned on. Sort of a randomly selected timbre.<br /><br />In non-periodic mode it's a much longer loop, so it's no longer a tone but just a repeating sound. You can hear the looping easily at the higher frequency settings.

(The same table is <a href="http://wiki.nesdev.com/w/index.php/APU_Noise" class="postlink">on the wiki</a>, and it's been independently verified on many occasions).<br /><br />The periodic mode ones should again be divided by 93 to give a musical pitch.<br /><br />The non-periodic mode ones shouldn't be divided by 32767, though, because this doesn't produce musical pitches; they are too low frequency to be perceived that way. However, the base samplerate of the non-periodic noise <em>does</em> generate harmonics at its samplerate which produce a faint but noticeable musical pitch, at least for the lower frequency settings. The higher frequency settings are too high to be perceived as musical pitch.<br /><br /><br />As such, if you're looking for perceived pitch frequency, use <strong>CPU / (table * 93)</strong> for the periodic mode, and just <strong>CPU / table</strong> for the non-periodic mode.

Perhaps Visual 2A03 could help understand this.<br /><br />Because of this, I expect it is at a consistent state on reset, and you can probably do what you're proposing.<br /><br />CopyNES installation would interfere with this, since it runs BIOS code on reset. There might be other situations that would compromise a user's system for this purpose too.<br /><br />The NSF format can't use such a trick either, because the player is supposed to set up the system prior to any code run from the NSF, so there's no guaranteed time-since-reset there. I did implement an option for randomized vs consistent noise initialization, though, in my NSF player, but that's really just so that you can get consistent results if you need tehm.
