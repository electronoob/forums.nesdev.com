<br />What is <span style="color: violet">bit</span> for?
<br />I spent a long while today trying to understand <span style="color: violet">bit</span>.
<br />I know that bits 7 and 6 of the memory are transfered to the <span style="color: yellow">status register</span>'s bits 7 and 6.  Then I think there was an AND that changes the Z flag.  And so I understand how <span style="color: violet">bit</span> works for <span style="color: violet">bpl</span> because it branches when the N flag isn't set... and N flag is bit 7.   Why did they make <span style="color: violet">bit</span>?

<br />That site has a great reference to instructions and how they work, I'd advise you to bookmark it. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" />
<br />
<br />And it's made AFAIK to do bit tests easy. To test one bit of a certain location, it's pretty simple and you don't have to even LDA with anything to test the top 2 bits:
<br />
<br />
<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">LDA #$02<br />BIT SomeFlags<br />BEQ FlatNotSet ;Bit #%00000010 is set?<br />;Flag is set if it makes it here.<br /></div>
<br />
<br />Sucks you can't do it indirectly and with lots of addressing modes, though.

<br />I remember searching the nesdev wiki for "table."  I have reread all 4 of your links to threads where you've talked about collision.  I'm excited to finally try to make my own!  But, I dont understand how tables work.  Is a table kind of like a 2dimentional matrix?

RPG's is probably a 2D array, but for a horizontal scrolling game that doesn't scroll up and down wuld maybe do better with 16 tables to build 1 screen, or the vertical method. There's probably more as I haven't messed with data much, but those seem the most obvious to me. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />

Not sure if that's what they used, but it in the end won't come out big at all if you use compression. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Not sure. But since probably all of your tiles will be 2x2 tiles, you only need 64 combinations of data and you build them from there. Check out how RLE compression works below. It basically tells it how many times one byte of data is repeated. So you can condense up to about 255 bytes of data to two bytes. It's a great thing to use, and needed in most games to fit them all in.
<br />
<br />RLE on Wikipedia:
<br />
<br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Run-length_encoding">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Run-length_encoding</a><!-- m -->
<br />
<br />And I'm pretty sure it's safe to say nearly every game uses some compression for probably all big stuff in their gams. Levels probably the main thing.
