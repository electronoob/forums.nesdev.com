		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Hi I'm going to put together a little list of SNES games that I'm going to order. You might wonder why I post it here.. well this are games that I'm going to rip apart and use as dev. carts..
<br />so what I really was thinking was:
<br />I probably need atleast one version that is LoROM and one that is HiROM (or maybe it's called SlowROM and FastROM? not to good with technical names)
<br />the other thing I thought was that the cart need to be like 16Mbit atleast
<br />and they have to have plenty of SRAM
<br />and also they have to be PAL
<br />
<br />so this are the ones I was choosing between:
<br />PAL - sim city 2000 - 256kbit SRAM, 16Mbit ROM, FastROM (seems to bee best pick.. but most expensive ~20$)
<br />PAL - Super Air Driver - NO SRAM, 4MBit ROM, DSP1, FastROM (nice b/c it got DSP1, bad b/c no SRAM and little ROM)
<br />PAL - FIFA Soccer '96  - 64kbit SRAM, 16 MBit ROM, FastROM (nice b/c it's really cheap.. ~5$)
<br />
<br />I'm also having problem finding any LoROM/SlowROM carts...
<br />if anyone got any idea what would be good dev. carts please make a post.
<br />
<br />edit:
<br />and also.. .what would be good flash memory for use with this?

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />The LowROM / HighROM stuff and the SlowROM/ FastROM stuff are absolutely independant. There is Low Slow ROMs, Low Fast ROMs, High Slow ROMs, and eventually High Fast ROMs. The older games are usually Low and Slow, and the newers are usually High and Fast, but there is mix of them (Secret of Mana is a High Slow ROM, while CastleVania - Dacula X is a Low Fast ROM).
<br />The difference is that the Low/High stuff says how the data is mapper for the CPU's view, and the Slow/Fast stuff says the read time of the chips, and I think Fast ROMs will be able to do more PPU writes or something.
<br />Also, some games used two mapped PRG-ROM chips instead of just one, so there is a bunch of various boards.
<br />Basically the chips can be either slow or fast, the mapping can be either low or high, there could be SRAM or not, and there can be one or two PRG chips, so 16 different combinations are possible, that doesn't mean that all of them are existant. (at least it's much simpler than the NES)
<br />
<br />Some more info about it would be welcome.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />well.. basicly I wanted to have a dev. cart that had much ROM space, much SRAM, and I would be nice if it had some of the special chips (but that's not that important) and about lo/slow/hi/fast rom I don't really know what makes you want to use one over the other..  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_confused.gif" alt=":?" title="Confused" />
<br />what I really going to use it for is when I want to show of my snes creation to someone and don't feel like takeing with me my super wildcard.
<br />I also feel that it might be better also test the game directly on the snes through a cart.. b/c you never know if something might work a little different on the super wildcard (like if the wildcard init snes memory)

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />As far as I know, no SlowROM (200ns) game cares whether it is using FastROM memory.  FastROM refers to the memory latency, at must be at 120ns or less.  I assume that the lower latency is required for the SNES to run at the 3.58MHz speed as opposed to the 2.68MHz speed, but I could be wrong about that.  The CPU speed and the ROM speed may not be so connected.  
<br />
<br />If you use siudym's switch, you only need one board to play any game that does not use a special chip.  The board must have the following:
<br />
<br />32KB Battery Backed RAM + MAD-1 Address Decoder
<br />36 pin ROM socket
<br />Lockout Chip
<br />
<br />SNES games use battery backed RAM in 2K, 8K or 32K sizes.  SNES games generally range in sizes of 256KB to 4MB, with one well-known game at 6MB.  A 36 pin socket will accomodate an 4MB or 8MB Flash Chip.  It doesn't matter if you use the switch if the board was originally HiROM or LoROM, so a common cartridge to use is Mario Paint, which fulfills all the above requirements.  If not, then use a Mario Paint and a Sim City 2000 cartridge, the latter for HiROM games.
