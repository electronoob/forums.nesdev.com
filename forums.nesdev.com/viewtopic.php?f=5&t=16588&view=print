But, I can't find information on lots of games.<br /><br />Specifically, does anyone have information on that game Morphcat had on display in Berlin? I can't seem to find even a picture of it. And my last info says it's untitled. ?

I think some of the unlicensed stuff on the FDS were originally developed by home hobbyists and later picked up by publishers such as Hacker, so these games may be considered borderline homebrew.<br />Also, there were people making stuff with Family Basic. I don't know other than self-satisfactory, whether they distributed these games to other people though. (I think the programmes could be recorded to tapes?)<br /><br />So, unless you don't count the Famicom and focus only on the NES, and/or are more strict on what a homebrew is, it should be much earlier than that.

Although it's gameplay is, to be honest, quickly boring when playing alone.<br /><br />I think NESSnake 2.0 was the first &quot;full&quot; homebrew that is not a tech demo with music, sound effects, graphcis that uses a significant portion of the console's abilities and that can be enjoyed completely alone.

I don't know other than self-satisfactory, whether they distributed these games to other people though. (I think the programmes could be recorded to tapes?)</div>Yeah I bet there where homebrew in the eighties by hobbyists, but with no internet to share them with they probably weren't very well known.<br /><br />Family BASIC programs were shared by printing the source code in magazines or on recorded tapes (I don't know if there where any radio programs broadcasting Family BASIC tape data, but that is also a way), so that was the main homebrew community back then. IIRC the Pokemon creators started out programming with Family BASIC and picked apart a Famicom console in order to learn how it works, before they got recruited by Nintendo in the late eighties.<br /><br />PC Engine had it's Develo BOX community in the ninties, code (BASIC and Assembly) was shared in magazines and the homebrewed executable programs, music and art came on CDs that came with the magazines.

I plan to feature about... maybe 40ish of them on my blog.<br /><br />On an unrelated note, I thought of a way to make Mario Kart on the NES. It involves using less than 50% of the screen, CHR-RAM, much slower frame rate (maybe 15 fps), and raycasting. It would look crappy, but I think you could simulate mode7 style perspective.
