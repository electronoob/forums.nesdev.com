		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />They did actually add a few very minor MMC5 enhancements for the US version of Castlevania 3.
<br />After you beat the game, you get some new monsters which did not appear in the Japanese version of the game, a highly erratic-moving skull monster, and an armored knight monster.  It uses an MMC5 feature to get more possible graphics for sprites, where it switches in graphics into the right pattern table after it has drawn the background tiles, but before it has drawn the sprites, then switches it back after it has finished drawing the sprites.  Effectively, you can get twice as many possible tiles for sprites than otherwise.  But it's only used to get 1k of extra sprite graphics.  (They took out the Japanese font, and had all this extra room left, so they threw in some extra monster graphics)
<br />The Japanese version of the game also didn't have the rising water level, that got added for the US version.  I'm not sure offhand which MMC5 feature it uses, but it does something to switch to a secondary (blue) tilemap below the water line.

<br />Hmm, I played the North American version quite a bit and I remember the Japanese version being much easier.  I only played a specific path through the game (I was doing a speed run using no spirit partners) and here are some examples of the North American version being more difficult:
<br />
<br />- Enemies are more powerful.  For example, get hit by anything in the last stage of the NA version and you lose 4 life bars.  In the Japanese version, you lose 2-3 bars on enemies in the stage and certain attacks by the final boss.
<br />
<br />- Speaking of the final boss, his third form is easier in the Japanese version because the lasers he shoots at you are half as long, making them a lot easier to avoid.
<br />
<br />- The very last section of the final stage has you navigate a series of pendulums.  In the North American version, there are bats that will attack you as you work your way from right to left, and they can actually be pretty tricky to avoid.  No bats in the Japanese version.   (Note: I once had a really good no-death run going up to this point and got clipped by a bat.  30 minutes down the drain  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" alt=":(" title="Sad" />  )

<br />
<br />It's in both versions. The US version is harder.
<br />
<br />Also, in case people here aren't already aware, there are some MMC5-style homebrew NSFs out there that sound pretty nice.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />@DWedit :
<br />Thanks for the explaination about the enemies. I admit I never played much the game in hard mode, in either version, so I wasn't aware about that.
<br />
<br />And yes the water rising level exists in all versions. It's just that in the japanase version, they switch to horizontal mirroring (vertical mirroring is used in the rest of the game), and have the top nametable for the status bar and level and the bottom nametable for the water. So they wrote a secondary scrolling routine for this sole leve and it has glitches when you scroll. The game also enable left-clipping only for this level, it even hides a part of the status bar ! Talk about rushed lazy work.
<br />
<br />In the US/PAL version they made it with 3 nametables, and used the top two nametables for the status bar/level as usual, and have the 3rd nametable at the bottom, so they could scroll nomrally and not have glitches.
<br />So this is the only place where the US/PAL version "looks better" because of the MMC5. All other levels are either the same or just palette swapped.
<br />
<br />And for all those who claim the japanese version is easier, have you tried to fight death in the japanese version ? Because I can guarantee he's MUCH, MUCH, MUCH easier in the USA/PAL version. He's almost impossible in the jap version, in fact he's as hard as in CV1, but there's two forms !
<br />
<br />There is other boss which are easier in the USA/PAL version too.
<br />However I agree the last 2 levels and last boss is ridiculously hard in the US/PAL version and easier in the japanese verison, but that doesn't mean the japanese version is easier everywhere !!

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Alrighty guys, I've decided the best way to tackle the final top 10 is individual posts once a day for the next ten days. This way allows individual comments to be left for each entry, allows me time to write the next one without keeping you waiting for the whole thing, and avoids a monstrously large final post that would dwarf any I've done before. It will be a little bit better for everyone in my estimation.
<br />
<br />Of course, you needn't agree with my choices, I'm just sounding my voice. I do hope for a discussion about these though, as they represent my absolutely favorites.
<br />
<br />So here's #10.
