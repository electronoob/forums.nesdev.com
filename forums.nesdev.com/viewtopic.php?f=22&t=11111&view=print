Honestly, I'd like a system where you have a map, and you have to strategically place your factories and other things in your &quot;world&quot; in order to maximize your cookies. As it stands right now, it's just a game about waiting, with very little else to think about, and although it's addictive to want to make your numbers bigger, it's really boring.

Several minutes later I discovered Cookie Clicker and I was clicking cookies and reading <a href="http://cookieclicker.wikia.com/wiki/" class="postlink">the wiki</a> and figuring out what the heck the Grandmapocalypse was supposed to be. At the time, it was just red cookies instead of golden cookies; now it's also cookie-multiplying leeches.<br /><br />Drag: If waiting in order to be able to build something is boring, then SimCity is likewise boring because you have to wait for tax time.<br /><br />3gengames: The same thing happened to me while making my own compo entry. Perhaps I'm just sharing the misery.

Graphics seem simple enough to work on an NES.<br /><br />Regardless, good luck with the project.  And speaking of &quot;dumbing down graphics to look like an NES&quot;, it still baffles me that there are people out there who think NES sprites could show four colors PLUS transparency.  Some even say the NES is only capable of showing 16 colors on screen, though given how often colors have to be shared to avoid glaring attribute conflicts, it might be sorta right.
