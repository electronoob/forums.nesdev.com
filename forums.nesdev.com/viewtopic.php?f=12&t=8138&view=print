		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />hi guys,
<br />
<br />currently i try to built a Zelda ancient stone tablets cartmod from my german translation. I test some different thing with tsop and Eprom/maskrom games.
<br />
<br />Like any of you know it Zelda AST a four week Game which was releases vom St. Giga for BSX. The guys from BSZelda Team has change a lot of things the last 10 years.
<br />
<br />After the release of Zelda AST i want to built a cartmod with a 4 way switch.
<br />I uses a DIP Switch with 2 pins.
<br />
<br /><img src="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/19735616/dip.jpg" alt="Image" />
<br />
<br />
<br />My question is, what i have to do, to enable and disable the eprom/tsop that i can play week1 (activ) week2,3,4 (inactive)
<br />
<br />I have try to set /OE to 5V to set eprom/tsop to inactive).
<br />This works, but if i connect 2 tsop adapter or 2 eproms and set /OE @ eprom1/tsop1 to +5V and eprom2/tsop2 to GND or reverse nothing happen.
<br />
<br />Could anyone advice the soldering?
<br />
<br />greetz and thanks

<br />
<br />
<br />I didn't even know that AST worked on real hardware. I remember putting Week 1 on a flash cart and it didn't boot, or the first screen froze, I don't remember exactly. Also, assuming the ROMs will work fine, will the save work?

<br />
<br />hi ziggy587,
<br />
<br />yes zelda ast works on real hardware. In 2010 after the german release d4s makes the game playable at real hardware.
<br />Check bszelda homepage for more infos.
<br />
<br />I have found the solution. Use 2 Dip-positions and set 
<br />
<br />1. /CE1 + GND = ON / 2. /CE1 + 5V = OFF / ,  3. /CE2 + GND = ON / 4. /CE2 + 5V = OFF / 
<br />
<br />so i can enable and disable the eproms/tsop.
<br />
<br />
<br />I check the manual of the AM29F032 flashchips and saw that it is possible to use seperate adressareas.
<br />
<br />Zelda is only 2MB each week, i thought i can use 2 weeks on 4MB flash and set GND and 5V to activate adress area 0-2MB and 2,01-4.00MB
<br />
<br />Dou you know is this possible in connection with snes bus etc.
<br />
<br />greetz and thanks
