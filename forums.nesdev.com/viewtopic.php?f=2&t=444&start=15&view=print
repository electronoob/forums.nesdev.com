<br />Is there something wrong with this? or is it just really unreliable. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_confused.gif" alt=":?" title="Confused" /> By the way, alot of this stuff I didn't include, because I'm too lazy.

<br />
<br />Essentially, on every NMI you'll want to set $2006 to the nametable you want to show minus $2000.  Since you want to show the $2000 nametable, then you should put it as $0000.  If you wanted to show the $2800 nametable, then $0800 would be your way.  You can also start in the middle of a nametable, like at $2305, which would become $0305.
<br />
<br />If you do any $2006/$2007 writes, then afterward you will still need to set $2006 to what I mentioned in the paragraph.  In other words, when you leave the NMI, you're going to need to have $2006 set to that value.
<br />
<br />Understand?
<br />
<br />Try it out btw.  Post the results. ^_^

<br />
<br />Pretty much.  I'm simplifying things a bit.  (That example will have it start on the second pixel of the first line.)
<br />
<br />Anyway, if you're program's still not working, then perhaps you can send me the source code along with the ROM and I'll see what's wrong.  K?

<br />
<br />For one -- setting the PPU address to $0001 (what you do in your example, Celius) will start rendering from the second <strong>column</strong> not the second row.  That basically has the same effect as scrolling the screen left 8 pixels.
<br />
<br />
<br />For two -- this is <span style="text-decoration: underline">exactly</span> what $2005 is for.  Not only is it MUCH easier to use for this kind of thing, but it also allows you to fine-scroll horizontally and vertically (scroll by pixels instead of by full 8-pixel tiles)
<br />
<br />Using $2006 for scrolling should only be done when you're splitting the screen -- and the only reason it's recommended then is because it's manditory.
<br />
<br />To start drawing from the second row... use this code instead:
<br />
<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">BIT $2002&nbsp; ; same effect as LDA $2002, but does not change A<br /><br />LDA #$00<br />STA $2000&nbsp; ; select nametable 0 &#40;ppu$2000&#41;<br />STA $2005&nbsp; ; set X scroll to 0 pixels<br />LDA #$08<br />STA $2005&nbsp; ; set Y scroll to 8 pixels &#40;one row&#41;<br /></div>
<br />
<br />After you set scroll values, do NOT mess with $2006 (do the above code after you've finished all your drawing).  And make sure rendering is on before VBlank ends (flip on $2001.4 or $2001.3 or both)

<br />
<br />Yeah, I should have said tile, which would have fit with column more.  That's right Celius, things get much more complicated.
<br />
<br />Then again, I'm not sure if Celius <em>was</em> trying to scroll.
<br />
<br />Disch, I never did recommend that he do $2006 like that, I was just trying to explain the effects (which I did wrongly).

<br />
<br />It's not that difficult.  Just read from $2002, then the first write to $2005 will be the horizontal scroll (in pixels, not tiles) and the second write to $2005 will be the vertical scroll (again, in pixels).  Try it!

<br />No, it won't.  It'll simply set the scroll to one pixel over to the right (if that's the horizontal scroll) and there it will remain until the value is changed.  Remember what Disch said: You also have to set $2006 as well to your current nametable.  If you want one scroll per vblank, try something like:

<br />No you don't - when you want to set your current nametable for rendering, you write to $2000 and specify your desired nametable in the bottom 2 bits (do this along with the reading $2002 and writing $2005 stuff).

<br />
<br />Setting the scroll is setting where the screen starts drawing from.  Here's a few diagrams which might explain.  The diagrams represent the two upper nametables (PPU $2000 [upper-left] and $2400 [upper-right]).  dots (.) represent the part of the nametables which is not visible.  # represents the areas that are visible:
<br />
<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">##########..........<br />##########..........<br />##########..........<br />##########..........<br />##########..........<br /></div><br /><br />This represents scroll values of 0  (X=0, Y=0).  The upper-left portion of the # block is where the screen starts drawing from.<br /><br />Now say you change scroll values so that you scroll halfway through the nametable (X=$80) :<br /><br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">.....##########.....<br />.....##########.....<br />.....##########.....<br />.....##########.....<br />.....##########.....<br /></div>
<br />
<br />The game is drawing the same nametables, it's just starting to draw from a different area.  In this case, it's drawing from further right in the nametable (which will make the screen appear to be moved left)
<br />
<br />
<br />Now -- you should be setting scroll values <span style="text-decoration: underline">every frame</span> -- and the value you write for that frame is where the screen draws from in that frame.  There is no "rate" or anything -- it just draws from where you tell it to.  If you want to game to appear to scroll in a direction, you will have to constantly change the values you write.
<br />
<br />For example, in beneficii's example, every frame he is writing a NEW value to the X scroll.  He has is so that the X scroll will be 1 more than it was last frame (making the screen scroll 1 pixel per frame).
<br />
<br />Although beneficii is still writing to $2006 -- which you shouldn't do.  For now, you should <strong>only</strong> be using $2006 for drawing (with $2007).  For scrolling, you use only $2000, and $2005 (and $2002 to clear the toggle -- but you should only have to do that once at the start of NMI)
