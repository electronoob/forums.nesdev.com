		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I'm coding a zap-tap type zapper for iphone, so you can just tap the ducks, etc. I can trigger the zapper just fine, and get the coordinates of the tap just fine; problem seems to be that, even if I freeze frames, I don't see any frame where there are white rectangles being drawn. I have one frame that is black, one or more frames that are just background (no sprites), and then the sprites come back.
<br />
<br />Am I supposed to be drawing the rectangles myself? It seems like I shouldn't even need to bother with this, then, except that I need to somehow know when it's checking each sprite for a hit. So I guess my question is, if I'm supposed to draw these rectangles myself (or at least know which sprite is being hit), how can I figure out which one to be drawing / checking?

<br />
<br />Games fill the screen with black to ensure that the zapper doesn't see light (to avoid scoring easy hits by shooting at a constant light source -- like a lightbulb).  If the zapper detects light (bit 3 read back as clear) with an all black screen, the game likely aborts drawing the rectangles and will force a miss.

<br />
<br />I don't think it's different -- but I didn't examine the game code so I can't say for sure.  I only get the black frame when I clear that bit -- when I update that bit appropriately it works fine for me.
<br />
<br />One zapper game I still have problems with is Chiller -- and I think it's because it uses a non-white color for the target rectangles (it's like red or something).  That game kind of sucks anyway so I didn't look into it much.  Chiller also handles the trigger a bit funky.
<br />
<br />
<br />Don't really know how I can help on this one.  How does your zapper logic work?  Perhaps I can point out flaws if you walk me through it (note:  not necessarily looking for code snippits here, more of just a logic breakdown).

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I've got zapper working for most games now. There are some games that don't set the background off, but just draw black pixels... so I had to add a test for this. There are also other games that don't set the bg off when they display the hot spots, so I created a frame counter and started decrementing that up to 8 (since there are 8 sprites); so for 8 frames after a screen blank (or bg off), the zapper will report light status back (which in my case is a touch screen).
<br />
<br />This got several, but not all games working. I think the rest (including Chiller, Operation Wolf, and Freedom Force) might have to do more with zapper timing. You can't time on Operation Wolf, for example, because it doesn't appear to blank anywhere. I think a more accurate timing for these would be N frames after trigger pull (or release). I'm investigating more.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I'm pretty sure the light sensor and trigger operate independently.  That is... the zapper is detecting (or not detecting) light constantly regardless of whether or not (or when) the trigger was pulled.
<br />
<br />You method of only doing so for the next N frames after a trigger pull seems a little hackish an indiret (rather than just examining the display of a given pixel).  Though I'm assuming you're doing it that way because it's probably much faster and speed is an issue on the iPhone.  I just thought I'd bring this up anyway.
<br />
<br />I haven't looked at Chiller in detail.  Maybe I will.  It's about time I got the the bottom of that in my emu.
<br />
<br />As far as timing goes -- I believe the zapper reports back its state in realtime.  That is, if the zapper's sight is on scanline 56, light will be detected on scanline 56 (and I've even heard that it becomes "undetected" after a few scanlines -- hence why games have to constantly poll the zapper for the whole frame rather than just checking it once per frame -- but I'm sketchy on that.)

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />It might operate as you say, but it's a little more complicated than that. The trigger and the light sensor have to be timed properly in a way that light isn't being reported when it shouldn't be - I don't know if this was to prevent cheating, or what have you, but if you start reporting the light sensor back before a blank in Duck Hunt, for example, it will ignore the light sensor completely, even after the blank.

<br />
<br />I don't think that's true.  I report light status all the time in my emu, regardless of trigger state and don't have any problems with Duck Hunt.  The only way I can see Duck Hunt doing what you describe is if you are reporting light back -during- the blank (not before it)
<br />
<br />
<br />Anyway -- I found my problem in Chiller.  Just wasn't updating the PPU when I needed to be.  Other than that, the game seems to use $15 as the trigger color instead of the preferred $30.
<br />
<br />Tried Freedom Force and don't have any problems -- although Operation Wolf doesn't work right for me. I'll have to look into it more.
<br />
<br />
<br />What I'm doing:
<br />--------------------------------------
<br />- I'm ignoring strobes -- reads always report realtime zapper status.  I don't know if this is accurate or not (anyone have an answer on this?)
<br />
<br />-) bit 4 reads back as set when the trigger is pulled, cleared when trigger released.  But since the zapper trigger is a two stage trigger it's actually released when you have it pulled all the way (when you pull the trigger, the first very soft click sets the bit, and the loud CLANG clears it).  I emulate this by setting the bit only for a few frames (currently 2), then clearing the bit.
<br />
<br />-) light status reported back all the time -- regardless of trigger state (I don't have any problems with this in my emu... and I don't see why it would work any other way)
<br />
<br />-) As for timing... light is detected as it is rendered.  If the zapper is at scanline 56, light is detected on scanline 56.
<br />
<br />-) Light "fades" after 25 or so scanlines (currently doing 25 scanlines).  So if the zapper detects light on scanline 50, then is polled on scanline 200, status will report no light detected.
<br />
<br />
<br />Operation Wolf is the only game mentioned so far that I have problems with with this method.  Do you know of other games to test zapper functionality?
