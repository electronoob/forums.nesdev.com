		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I took a moment to think out a version of Dodgeball for the NES/FC.<br /><br />And while I would be very excited for being able to actually do a game where you have 6 characters on either side of a playfield, with the playfield working in the fashion of Ice Hockey, I am actually a bit confused on one very important aspect:<br /><br />How would the scroll logic work?<br /><br />Specifically, Where should you scroll? <br /><br />In games like Ice Hockey, and the like, you have ONE BALL, and the current players clustered around that ball, this makes the scroll logic much easier to implement, but in Dodgeball, would I simply scroll to encompass both selected players on screen, and only select players visible within the scroll window?<br /><br />Just curious, as I scribble down notes. I tend not to embark on projects until I have a rock solid idea of the entirety of the game in my head, and right now that's Wizard of Wor...but I do find the idea of doing Dodgeball in the style of the classic NES launch titles appealing (just as Dodgeball on the VCS was done like a 2K launch title with a two line kernel)<br /><br />-Thom

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />The trick is that most dodgeball rules include lots of balls going at once.  If that's the case, it becomes trickier. (But how does one player even manage that?  Maybe it should be a game for the multi-tap)

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />If the ball is moving left (or the player is about to throw left) you could also bias the scroll toward that direction.<br /><br />For multiball I'd probably just accept the compromise of averaging the ball camera targets, even though that might result in one or all balls offscreen... but I'd also try to make the game controls/feedback such that it's possible to control adequately even if the player isn't onscreen. Sound effects, offscreen-arrows, a mini-map, players selection controls that still work OK &quot;blind&quot;, etc. could all help in this regard.<br /><br />For things like this I generally find that it's hard to choose until you protoype multiple behaviours to compare and test.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Oh, by the way: I'm not sure whether you should actually use the name ADAA. I mean, it's a fictitious organization of the movie anyway, so you can just as well invent your own league. Otherwise, it might be problematic if you ever intend to sell the game.<br /><br />Unless of course you're actually going for a game based on the movie, i.e. where you can play with Average Joes and the final opponents are the Purple Cobras.<br />But I would advise against that. A Dodgeball game with multiple balls is a pretty novel concept. I would create this as a general sports title, not as a movie conversion. This way, it's really your intellectual property and you can sell this as a game that stands on its own.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />If you plan to present dodgeball as a legitimate sport, I'd recommend basing the court dimensions and rules on one of the recognized dodgeball codes. For example, the USA has a National Dodgeball League, and <a href="http://thendl.com/theNDL-Dodgeball-101.asp" class="postlink">its rules</a> specify a court 60 by 30 feet in size, the same as that of a volleyball court.<br />(Source: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dodgeball" class="postlink">&quot;Dodgeball&quot; on Wikipedia</a>)<br /><br />Useless trivia: National Dodgeball League and National Diet Library (Japan's counterpart to the Library of Congress) share initials, and National Diet Library is the only library known to Wikipedia's &quot;authority control&quot; template to recognize dodgeball as a distinct subject.
