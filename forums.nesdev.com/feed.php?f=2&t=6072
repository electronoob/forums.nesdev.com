Yippee, after two weeks and some trouble with customs (didn't have to pay anything, they just confiscated the packet "because no bill was attached to it") I finally hold BK in my hands. It's a proto version, too.<br /><br />It's a lot of fun, but damn, do I suck at it.<br />This game was totally not made for my shaky hands and lack of sense for timing. <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" /><p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=1377">miau</a> — Fri Mar 12, 2010 3:54 am</p><hr />

<div class="quotetitle">Disch wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"><br />I guess yeah, scalping is bad for the people who want the product.  But it's not necessarily bad for the person selling the product.<br /></div><br />It's good for the buyer as well if it's available in limited quantities and underpriced. A scalper ensures that those who <em>really</em> want it will get it. It's like so-called price gougers when there's a shortage of e.g. water or gasoline. If they didn't jack up the price, the first few people to come through would empty them out.<br /><br />What's the criticism others have though? A scalper pays for it like anyone else. Once he does so, it's his. Then he is free to charge whatever he wants, and potential buyers are free to decline paying what he's charging. If nobody bought his stuff, he'd have to lower his prices or find a new line of work. So you might as well blame those that buy from a scalper as well, since they are essential to his operation.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=17">blargg</a> — Wed Mar 10, 2010 9:58 pm</p><hr />

The case of Battle kid is maybe of smaller scale and we only saw one so it's not like it's the end of the world but the message was more that it's a form of scalping if more ends up on ebay because of the current unavailability of the product.  I just don't support scalpers in general. It's my opinion and other people don't have to agree with it.  <br /><br />I remember for the PS3 in Japan, some "business man" (...) were paying beggars to wait in line so they could get a PS3 and resell it after.

This money could have been used by them to produce new products. It's not like retrozone is a large company and have a publicity budget or something.<br /><br />For now it's only 1 case, no big fuzz.  Just hope it doesn't become a trend.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3559">Banshaku</a> — Tue Mar 09, 2010 11:15 pm</p><hr />

In any situation when something get scarce, there is always some ass that  will try to make a buck out of it.  Same thing when the wii came out or PS3 in the state.  I'm not surprised at all since it's on Ebay.  <br /><br />The worst thing is the game will be in stock soon so it's not like it won't be available for years or out of print.. I don't approve that way of doing things but I guess there's nothing we can do.  That's not supporting the author at all.  If I had the adapter to play it on my famicom or a US nes, I would surely buy it once it come back in stock but NEVER on ebay. It's not a game that sold millions like a professional one that is now rare or something.<br /><br />(reposted message in right thread, for some reason it was moved. phb issue?)<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3559">Banshaku</a> — Tue Mar 09, 2010 10:49 pm</p><hr />
