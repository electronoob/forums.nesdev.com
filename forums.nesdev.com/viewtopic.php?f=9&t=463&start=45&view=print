<br />At least for me, if the PCB costs 20 euros, I'm looking at $80 + the shipping of the PCB and whatever it takes to build the cable for a rough cost estimate.

<br />At least Digikey sells DS1218S.. they also sell the CPLD but not the slower (-15) version that would be the cheapest. The flashes are AMD AM29F040B and 90ns ones

<br />Oops, that's what I mean. So does your writing algorithm only support AMD Flash at 90ns or can I use some other 29F (or even 28F?) at 100 or 120ns?

<br />Yep, the algorithm supports now only AM29F040B but it shouldn't be too hard to change the software to support some other flashes as well (as long as they are 5V programmable). I believe the original NES carts use 100ns chips, so guess you could use those. 90ns is guaranteed to work <img src="./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" />

<br />
<br />Yep, because I couldn't even get the IDCODE off the Winbonds, so I gave up <img src="./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" /> The USB cable is using a FT2232 chip, it has a JTAG mode and they give out a free JTAG DLL.. so it should make everything easy.
<br />
<br />I made myself a PCB already for the USB-cable, but their own configuration software is having trouble with the device. I think the weird EEPROM I have now is not compatible with the chip but I ordered a sample from microchip, 93LC46.. So waiting for that to come and then if the cable works, I'll order a bunch of PCBs for that too.
<br />
<br />So the USB-cable EEPROM needs to be configured first but FTDI has their own software that can configure it on the board when you have put the device together.
<br />
<br />Cable proto (the USB chip is under the board):

<br />Those USB JTAG cables are so expensive.. Yep, I'll sell the both PCBs and I think the price for both together will be around $15 shipped, does it sound fair? Also the chip on the USB cable has even tinier package than the CPLD (but less pins).. but it is still easy to solder <img src="./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" />

<br />
<br />Nope, it will work only with my device..
<br />Yes, $15 is enough for me.
<br />I got my FT2232C directly from the manufacturer (from UK).
<br />I am sure you won't need a new soldering iron.. I am using a huge-tipped 20 EUR one.. works fine. But of course it would help a little if it were smaller <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />
