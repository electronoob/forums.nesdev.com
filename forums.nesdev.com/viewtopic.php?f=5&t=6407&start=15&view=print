<br />
<br />I dislike levels which seem "flat" and do not have much variety. Even if a game cannot scroll more than 2 directions, I'd prefer to have the sensation that I have "descended" into another level or "ascended" into one, giving you the psychological feel that the game has a vertical dimension, even though all gameplay is horizontal (like Castlevania). I haven't played much of the game, but the Bart Simpon and the attack of the space mutants had a horribly flat first level, for example. So, that's my pet peeve. Flatness.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I have to agree with people saying Metroid 1 is way too repetitive in terms of level design. It's also a pretty bad game, but since I'm a fan of the series and it's nostalgic for me to play during the winter, I find it oddly enjoyable. I definitely agree with tokumaru about enemies who "can't remember they're dead" (I also find that's a funny way to put it <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /> ). I made sure to not do this in my game by having dead/alive bits for every enemy in the level (only takes 16 bytes for 128 enemies; I think that's pretty good).
<br />
<br />I think something really annoying is in games like Metroid (I know another game does this too, I just can't think of it right now) where you fall into some sort of lava or poison mud and its nearly impossible to get out of before you die. Basically scenarios where its impossible to not get damaged or die by no fault of your own are not cool with me. Another thing in Metroid that makes me want to kill someone is when you walk through a door, the screen shifts over as you're still inside the door, and if an enemy is flying at you while moving into another room, you <em>will</em> get hit by it. Plus, since it's Metroid 1, you probably have 42 energy left and the enemy does like 45 damage.

Re-used screens and enemies who re-appear are really design flaw from the programmers, not a fair challenge. But I'm disapointed seeing people here hate spikes bottom less pits etc... Do you want a game which is all flat has no traps and is very easy to beat ?? It doesn't sound like it'd be fun for a very long time.

<br />Not as bad as when an enemy gets <em>inside</em> the door with you as you change rooms. Then you get hit many times in a row, likely killing you before the doorway even scrolls to the center of the screen.

<br />I agree.  He goes from criticizing hardware limitations to legitimate design complaints to simple personal preferences.  Many subjective things aren't design flaws, otherwise if you didn't like RPGs you could call the mere fact that a game is an RPG a design flaw.  In fact he effectively does, multiple times.  Some people like upgrading their weapons in shops!
<br />
<br />He frequently alternates between complaining that things are too realistic and not realistic enough.  First something is realistic but too tedious to make a good game, then it's a mortal sin because there isn't a forklift sitting around somewhere.
<br />
<br />A game with chesty women is not a design flaw.  I don't buy games for that reason either, but some people do, and it's just a dumb generic complaint.
<br />
<br />I think the part I found most humorous is the third page, where he talks about how too many games are adolescent power fantasies, citing The Sims as an example that people don't care about ruling the world.  Are you kidding?  That's the whole point of The Sims, to be god over these little people and force them to do what you want.  It's almost the epitome of a power fantasy.

<br />
<br />People think those blocks  are so tough.. in Mega Man 9, I went through Plug Man's stage without ever dying, first try.  You know why?  Those blocks are damn predictable.  The ONLY problem I have with them is in Mega Man 2, in Heat Man's level specifically, they spawn based on whether you're there or not, so sometimes they spawn too late / too early and your timing is thrown off, but it's only a problem near the beginning of that area (before the lava).
<br />
<br />On the "no twinkie" articles, they were a fun read but I agree that some of his gripes are just gripes about preference.  Most Metal Gear instances where they say "Press A to do something" are like jokes to the player and handled as such, not just poor design.
<br />
<br />On the issue of Metroid, I agree that it's not really a good game.  People like it (and usually its music) purely for nostalgic purposes.  The only song I still enjoy listening to for the sake of listening to it is Kraid.  The overworld theme is nice because of good composition but not because of poor volumes and flat technique.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />For its time, Metroid was a big break from the usual games. Just being able to go back anywhere was a big thing. Up until you fire the last shot that defeats Mother Brain, I'm pretty sure you can go all the way back to the beginning. The non-linearity of it, where you progress by being able to get to more of each area, was also fairly new. I actually thought the repeating screens had benefits in that you had to make maps. And then there was the fact that there was no text or talking during the game. Sure, Mario had little text, but you always knew what to do: go right.
<br />
<br />As for stupid-hard aspects of games, this is where emulator features like save states and slow motion can make these games more enjoyable. So what if it's not how they were meant to play? If it allows me to go through more of the games of the time and half-enjoy the experience, it's a win.

<br />What's most humorous is the awful web page design when viewing articles, where it has some annoying frames at the top and bottom, along with detailed instructions about how to get around the problems they cause in order to print. If you have to explain to a user how to use your web page, you're doing it wrong!

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I think Metroid is similar to zelda in a lot of ways, and I know people will disagree with me on this, but check it out.
<br />
<br />  Both Zelda in Metroid take place in large open worlds where exploration is limited primarily on your skill.  In the beginning, in both games you lack a crucial item that severely limits your exploration (Maru Mari, Wooden sword).  This makes sure you understand a little about how the game works before you go off and die, but is brief enough that if you have experience it's not very time consuming.
<br />
<br />   From then on you're free to explore in almost any manner you wish, acquiring power ups that slightly extend your exploration, rather than unlock massive areas.  Bombs are extremely important in both.  You can beat dungeons out of order in zelda.  You can beat ridley before kraid in metroid.
<br />
<br />   Something that Zelda did right that I wish was in metroid, is a quick health refill when you don't upgrade your life.  Trying to fill 5 energy tanks worth of health by killing enemies is just a time waster.  Even worse, when you continue both start you off at low health, but in zelda there's at least that fairy pond.

<br />I called him on that in an e-mail, but he said he was criticizing games for consoles from the era in which the articles were written, that is, the PS2 and newer, not resource-constrained systems like handhelds, phones, classic systems, or $20 "TV games". Then I called him on a few complaints that would apply to DDR (no pause, for a good reason), WarioWare (wildly atypical levels, fake interactivity, and failure to explain, for a good reason), and NetHack (only save is before death, for a good reason), but he said the rules aren't hard and fast, and I seem to remember he called my examples overreaching.
<br />
<br />As for The Sims: it's a matter of scope. You're trying to rule your neighborhood, not the world.
