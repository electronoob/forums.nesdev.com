In theory I suppose a passthrough cartridge could work (yeah, that'd be a custom flashcart), but in practice I'm not sure how feasible would that be. The program is not a problem since the SVP doesn't contain a ROM (the game loads the SVP program into RAM and then boots the processor).<br /><br />In any case by general rule its timings and such should match the SSP1601 (and a quick look at the datasheet does seem to imply that it's one cycle per instruction for the most part, albeit it doesn't need prefixes like the SuperFX does), what we don't know is if any of the opcodes not used by Virtua Racing were removed.<br /><br />...also huh what? Reading some doc I have here (svpdoc.txt) and according to this, it has the address line rearrangement thing I mentioned before, but it's only used during test mode and not in-game. The hell, Sega?

They could've had SNES pinouts the same as the NES, but use the 10 EXT pins to extend the PPU data bus to 16-bit, and 2 extra bits for the PPU address bus.  Maybe extend the pinouts by another 16 pins to extend the CPU and PPU address buses.

Nobody checked the <em>true</em> speed, but in any case it doesn't need to be any higher than that for Virtua Racing to work as intended - hence the comparison to the SuperFX 1, which is 10MHz (contrast to the SuperFX 2, which is 21MHz - and yes I'm aware it's just the same processor at different clock speeds =P).<br /><br />Also beware with quotes about the SVP speed. A common one is that it uses a 13.2MHz clock directly from the console... which is actually a video signal /o\ (the same rumor had been made about having the 68000 run at that speed)

What really sickens me is how they act like they're hardware &quot;experts&quot; or something when, from what I've heard of everyone on there, they know jack shit except how to spread hate. (that website has definitely gotten itself a reputation.) It astonishes me how one person says something like that and everyone goes along with it. If you notice in there thread, they make fun of the fact that the SNES would &quot;run Gunstar Heroes at half the frame rate.&quot; but totally disregard the fact that the &quot;mode 7&quot; demo in pier solar or whatever only runs at 12 frames per second, which at that point, you might as well be drawing polygons onscreen. I already know that the demo only uses 16 colors to draw the texture, so its not even as useful. (It appears to use a second background for the cloud reflection though). My theory about the Genesis extremists on that site is that when they were young, they wanted a SNES, but got a Genesis though and tried to convince themselves that they got the more powerful system, despite there being nothing that supports this. Lastly, I love how they say the SNES couldn't handle black apple because it wouldn't run at the same frame rate (my ass, half of the background is repetitive tiles and you have window layers) but again, could care less that the mode 7 demo runs a 12 fps. (I guess framerate only matters on the SNES.  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt=":roll:" title="Rolling Eyes" />) It's also kind of funny that there so called &quot;movie&quot; runs in straight black and white because it would take to much time to transfer the tiles and that it would end up looking like utter garbage using 64 colors (It probably wouldn't even be doing that because of the fact the BG is 4bpp) out of a 512 master palette.<br /><br />Sorry about my rant there.  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_redface.gif" alt=":oops:" title="Embarassed" />  It's just that people like them actually make me hate playing my Genesis.<br /><br />Edit: Oh yeah, there is <strong>no way</strong> they tried you're Gunstar Heroes demo. (There too much of stubborn jackasses.) I actually think it would be cool if somebody did port Gunstar Heroes to the SNES and actually improve it graphically by giving sprites their own color palette, (E.g. 16 color explosions) adding BG 3 and even some transparency effects where they can be added just to make them shut up. (They wouldn't even download it though, because they want to live in their fantasy land.)<br /><br />Edit 2: The best part is, I just noticed I'm wearing a Sonic shirt.  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_eek.gif" alt=":shock:" title="Shocked" /> Excuse me for my horrible picture taking.<div class="attachtitle">Attachment:</div><div class="attachcontent">
