		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Speaking of NTSC... what are the best default settings for nes_ntsc or snes_ntsc?
<br />
<br />Yes, I know some of these questions have already been answered in this thread, but I'm not about to go through every confusing post when all I'm looking for is some very simple answers to some very simple questions. :p
<br />
<br />I'm not talking about the color settings and whatnot.. I of course use all the deafults (which seems to be composite).
<br />I'm talking about the other things that have to be applied afterwards, such as scanline doubling method and aperance of scanlines(if any).
<br />- I already interpolate scanlines while doubling, which looks the best.  I assume that this gives the closest results to the real thing once some kind of darkening or brightening is applied to render scanlines, but without that it makes it look 'muddy'.
<br />- Should scanlines be visible, and if so, should they brighten or darken the source relatively?  If I remember correctly, the demo darkened, and that's where I took my code from and modified it for my own purposes, but brightening instead seems to give a more realistic effect.  What does an actual 1980s/1990s TV with an NES connected to it look like with regards to scanlines?
<br />- Field merging... I hate this, not using it causes jitter on computer monitors but also seems to greatly improve the color quality (such as on MM3's Snake Man stage).  Is the color quality loss due to a poor algorithm in the filter, or is it better to just display the interlaced video as-is and put up with the jitter ?  (It looks better to me, anyway.).
<br />- Host resolution... I run in 640x480 since my emulator is based upon classic fullscreen designs (as opposed to GUI designs where the window is no bigger than the game screen), and the video is stretched to 602x480 or some such by the filter and simply drawn in the middle of the screen... leaving borders at the sides.  I'm guessing that this is the correct aspect ratio, but I'd just like to make sure...
<br />- What's the best way to handle top/bottom picture cropping for NES NTSC games?  I know some TVs do it and some don't, and they're usually all different.. but what is the most common case?  Are the sides ever cropped?  What about the distortion that happens as you get closer to the edges of the screen?  Does it affect the colors at all?
<br />- Is any of this stuff changed in a newer version or anything?  Just to make sure I'm not asking questions about outdated stuff. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" />
<br />
<br />I'm asking all of this because it's now the default filter in my emulator and I'd like some reasonably realistic defaults.

<br />On a standard TV, the sides of the window are cropped by between 3.5% and 5.0% of the image width per side (per BBC safe area guidelines). This would be between 22 and 32 PC pixels on each side if you are stretching the approx. 280x240 NES pixels to 640x480 PC pixels.

A less-intensive algorithm (if doing it with the CPU) is to just double scanlines and darken the second lines, and this also looks a bit sharper.<br /><br />Scanline handling is still something that nobody has really refined yet.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">Should scanlines be visible, and if so, should they brighten or darken the source relatively?

This can be done by darkening every other row, or lightening every other row. The problem with lightening is that you get overflow for bright colors. You can clamp the value, but then you get clamping distortion (consider lightening 1.0,1.0,0.8 to 1.0,1.0,1.0 - it went from yellow to white). Darkening never results in these errors, so it's preferred.<br /> <br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">Field merging...

Is the color quality loss due to a poor algorithm in the filter, or is it better to just display the interlaced video as-is and put up with the jitter ?</div><br />If you run without field merging one frame at a time, you'll see that the NTSC NES color pattern shifts back and forth each frame between two patterns. Since this is occuring 60 times per second, your eye sees these two patterns mixed together if the scene isn't scrolling. If you're trying to display these alternating patterns on a PC display that isn't running at 60 or 120 Hz, the even and odd versions of the pattern won't get displayed for an equal amount of time, and the ratio will slowly shift back and forth, resulting in a visual appearance of one pattern, then another. Field merging internally merges the two patterns into one that's always displayed every frame, eliminating this effect. There's no way around it if the PC display isn't running at 60 or 120 Hz. But it's not a problem since field merging gives the same image you'd get if the display were running at 60 or 120 Hz (except when the image is scrolling, where it shimmers less with field merging enabled).<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">I run in 640x480 [...] and the video is stretched to 602x480 or some such by the filter and simply drawn in the middle of the screen... leaving borders at the sides.</div><br />The left and right borders should be filled with the background color. You can use the filter to do this by making your source image larger than 256x240. Use NES_NTSC_IN_WIDTH( 640 ) to find out how many pixels wide it should be. To be really correct, there should be slightly more border on the left than right. Ideally you have 15 left border pixels, 11 right border pixels, but the NTSC filter is too wide by about 3%, so you don't get as many border pixels. By my calculation the NTSC filter allows for 271 NES pixels per row, which leaves 15 NES pixels for the border. You could put 8 NES border pixels on each side of your source image (making it 272 pixels wide total). Then feeding 271 NES pixels per row to the filter output 637 pixels per row, leaving 3 to be filled with black.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">Are the sides ever cropped? What about the distortion that happens as you get closer to the edges of the screen? Does it affect the colors at all?</div><br />Yeah, the sides are covered, so the above border color handling is only necessary if you want to emulate a full overscan display. Colors aren't distorted near the edge of the screen.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">Is any of this stuff changed in a newer version or anything?

<br />Best to run a NES and 1990s TV along side your emulator and adjust as necessary. You might want to use a different default than composite. For example you could up the resolution and sharpness a bit.
