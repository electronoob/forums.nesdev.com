<br />
<br />I got motivated to check into this more from the following post:<a href="http://nesdev.com/bbs/viewtopic.php?p=91512#91512" class="postlink">http://nesdev.com/bbs/viewtopic.php?p=91512#91512</a>,  but wanted to follow up with the discussion on this thread also. 
<br />
<br />There's more details about how figured all this out there, but I'm now certain that Nintendo ignored the consecutive writes intentionally.  I'm also pretty sure they did it with a simple state machine clocked my M2.  It will only allow a write if PRG R/W was high the last CPU clock cycle.
<br />
<br />Aside from that I think you might have an error in your MMC1 schematic.  When I tested your PRG switch in my verilog testbench PRG mode1 and mode2 (H and F based on Kevtris' docs) they were backwards.  I may have just misinterpreted your schematic but that's how it appeared to me.

<br />MMC1 can do more than the extant mapper 2 boards:
<br /><ul><li>Twice the PRG ROM capacity (512 KiB) </li><li>Up to 32 KiB of PRG RAM </li><li>Nametable mirroring switch (1-screen $000, 1-screen $400, H, V) </li></ul>
<br />I know Rad Racer used SGROM just for switchable mirroring. (<a href="http://nesdev.com/bbs/viewtopic.php?t=8588" class="postlink">Another topic</a> delves into how it draws its road.) I guess much of the rest of the <a href="http://bootgod.dyndns.org:7777/search.php?pcb_op=LIKE+%60%25%40%25%60&amp;pcb=SGROM&amp;group=groupid&amp;field=2&amp;order=asc&amp;rfa=1+2+11+3+9+20+41+53" class="postlink">SGROM game list</a> used it for much the same reason.
<br />720Â°, Bad Street Brawler, Battle Chess, Battle of Olympus, Bionic Commando, Defender of the Crown, Faxanadu, Ikari Warriors 2, Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade, Kid Niki, Mega Man 2, Muppet Adventure: Chaos at the Carnival, Phantom Fighter, Princess Tomato, Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves, Rocket Ranger, The Rocketeer, Space Shuttle Project, Strider, Tecmo Baseball, Tombs and Treasure, Win Lose or Draw, and Winter Games
<br />
<br />And there are a bunch of games that use SNROM just for PRG RAM. No Nintendo board modified mapper 2 with PRG RAM in the way that Family BASIC modified mapper 0 with PRG RAM.

<br />
<br />Well before anyone else decides to get on their high horse...
<br />
<br />Perhaps I should say I am merely starting with the MMC1.  I've got all the discrete mappers down which obviously didn't take much.  My end goal is to do something like this for the MMC5.  But I can't just jump into the MMC5 acting like I really know what I'm doing.  Gotta start simple.  Lots of things are well understood about how to program with most of the MMC's but not much info as to how the hardware works or was designed.  Lots of things that are a mystery about these mappers are fairly simple to figure out with proper test equipment.
<br />
<br />I want to ACCURATELY replicate/emulate all of these mappers in hardware/emulators and it doesn't appear that the documentation is currently not available to do so.  Everyone's solution seems to be 'just' decap it, but there is still a lot that can be found by stimulus and response testing outside the NES.  And if I can make it look identical from the outside I would think that's good enough for most people.

I'm interested in new behavioral details as long as they're factual, but I can't imagine there being much left to discover about something so beaten to death. Maybe I'm cranky because I started a thread like this 5.5 years ago (though I was inexperienced and the logic was wrong): <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://nesdev.com/bbs/viewtopic.php?t=1866">http://nesdev.com/bbs/viewtopic.php?t=1866</a><!-- m -->
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />Maybe I should point out something that I haven't noticed being taken into consideration: the MMC1 isn't likely to be a fully-custom chip, it's probably an early, very low capacity CMOS gate array by Sharp. It would be implemented in CAD using idiot-proof megafunctions provided by Sharp, like a low-tech FP<strong>GA</strong>. Any errors or wonky behavior are almost certain to be logical, not poor analog characteristics. And yes conserving logic is important because gate arrays are inefficient at routing so a significant amount of the array is typically not usable. Megafunction blocks are however designed at the transistor level so are more efficient than the same function being implemented in gates so there isn't a big penalty for a DFFE vs a DFF for example, but you might run into grid/placement issues depending on the shape of the block I guess.

<br />Yes and this thread is about simulating it's behavior. The fact the chip is well understood doesn't prevent one to do a simulation of the chip, does it? Note that I didn't do only the MMC1 but I did all the MMCs except MMC5 (for now).

<br />Of course not, anyone should carry out whatever experiments they wish. I think a thread like this should be definitive though if it's going to be made, and especially if it's referenced. I could draw a very rough and incomplete MMC5 now but it's useless if it only shows that I know how to design a kind-of-working mapper and doesn't bring anything new to the table (either new mapper behavior or clever insight to the logic's implementation).

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Okay well the more I dig around the more interesting things I find... It also appears this is stirring things up a bit more around here than I expected.  As of now my plan is to keep probing away at this thing.  I'll post what I find here, but keep in mind this is still experimental data.  I could have broke something inside my MMC1 at some point, have a bad connection somewhere, or anything really.  At risk of being wrong about something I'll still post it here.  If I should start a new thread just let me know.  But I don't see why to right now.  
<br />
<br />Once I figure things out as best I can if someone wants to write a test rom to verify these things on other MMC1's while running on the NES etc I would think it's a good idea before considering any of this official.  I'm just performing experiments to try and figure out how this thing is actually built.  Once things have been verified, I'll release what my official design is of the MMC1 that is as accurate as I can tell.  With all that said hopefully no body gets their panties in a wad...
<br />
<br />To answer your question Bregalad.  Like we discussed earlier if the double write ignore isn't intentional then they wouldn't have added extra logic to check for double (or more than double) consecutive writes and only acknowledge the first.  So some optimization or 'don't care' would have had to be made use of if it was unintentional.  There are only a few ways to do this.  Here are some possibilities that I disproved in my experiments.
<br />
<br />The biggest possibility I saw was the fact that PRG R/W stays low between sequential writes.  It will only go high when a read is done.  So maybe they are clocking something with PRG R/W (even though it sounds like a bad idea).  With my tests I was able to actually pull PRG R/W high between the two writes without changing M2 or PRG /CE.  Even if I did this, the follow on writes were ignored.
<br />
<br />Another idea is some bad circuit or something that a capacitance or something that requires time to discharge so the second write is ignored.  But since I can wait seconds between writes this is disproved because it didn't matter how much time I wait between writes (usually 50msec for my rig).
<br />
<br />The real kicker for me was the question, "what if I perform 3, 4, 5 or more writes concecutively?"  What I found, only the FIRST will be acknowledged.  ALL follow on writes are ignored.
<br />
<br />Then I asked, "what if I write to ROM (MMC1), then WRAM, then ROM?  Even though it's impossible to do with the NES, It turns out only the first will still be acknowledged.  Even if you write below where the MMC1 can see ($0000-$5FFF) for several cycles but then come back and write to ROM.  It still only acknowledges the first write. 
<br />
<br />I then asked "Well if it isn't checking PRG R/W solely (based on my earlier statement.)  How is it sensing the follow on writes?"  I the only thing I could figure is that it uses M2 and only checks PRG R/W when clocked.  But how to check this?  Well what if we DON'T clock M2 but still do everything else normally.  It turns out that consecutive writes WILL be acknowledged if we do this.  Regardless if M2 is held high or low.  This also further proves that PRG R/W can be held low between writes and still get each write acknowledged.  This also means M2 is used for more than just WRAM CE.  It's not used for clocking the Shift register, but is used for checking for consecutive writes.
<br />
<br />And if they did this, then the MUST have ignored consecutive writes on purpose.  Unless they somehow accidentally threw in an extra flipflop to create an 'enable write' signal by clocking PRG R/W each CPU clock cycle.  Which I think everyone will agree isn't plausible.
<br />
<br />One question I have yet to answer yet though is, "will blocked writes with D7=1 cause resets or not?"  So really this could also be asked, "will DEC $00 cause a reset or cause a 0 to be loaded into the shift register with no reset."  I'll get around to this at some point.
<br />
<br />
<br />I also did some testing today to check into the details of how only the address of the last write matters as stated in Kevtris' docs.  Turns out this is only true to a certain point.  I found this out accidentally at first, but it turns out it's actually possible to write TWO Registers at ONCE.  Well almost, You can write to one full register and bits 4-0 of a second.  If one were to implement this the 5th bit of the second register appears to always be set to 1.  Now the exact details of this I'm not 100% certain of yet but here's what it looks like to me.
<br />
<br />So according to kevtris:
<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">LDA #&#91;data to load&#93;<br />STA 08000h&nbsp; ;It does not matter where these first 4 writes occur. only the last write matters.<br />LSR A<br />STA 08000h<br />LSR A<br />STA 08000h<br />LSR A<br />STA 08000h<br />LSR A<br />STA 0E000h&nbsp; ;NOTE: register 3 is what gets loaded!</div>
<br />
<br />But what I've found is that if the last 'STA 0E000h' instruction is located in $E000-FFFF this is true.  However if this instruction were in $8000-9FFF, I believe that in addition to reg3 getting loaded as normal, bits 4-0 (F, H, and M1, M0) would also get loaded with the same value that we loaded reg3 bits 4-0 with.  The one thing I'm not certain of is what the 5th bit gets set to.  I did some similar testing with CHR registers (Reg1 and Reg2) and the 5th bit always gets set to 1.
<br />
<br />I found this by only changing the address the last byte is written to, and keeping the address of the previous cycle's read the same as the previous writes.  Implementing this on the NES the read that occurs the cycle before the write of a STA is from the address of the STA instruction.  So wherever that read is performed from, the associated register gets partially written to.  Looking at the opcodes this is only true for addressing modes that read from PC (+) before the write.  Looks like you might get something funky for some addressing modes.
<br />
<br />So it would seem this is somewhat of a bug and I wouldn't think it's intentional.  But it gives hits as to how it's constructed.  Looks like the copying from the Shift register to the other registers gets enabled a little early as a result of an optimization from not caring about this issue.
<br />
<br />Well I thats all I've got for now, at this point I'm not sure how much I care to dig deeper.  I should have enough info to get mine working atleast.  It's been fun solving some of this puzzle but I don't think it's very fruitful to dig around much deeper.  Most of this register stuff could be checked with ROM testing on the NES it just takes a lot longer to check each step compared to my set up.  If someone wants something specific tested let me know.  I can also burn eproms and test on the NES also.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />OK so what does happen if I write for example at $2000, then immediately I write at $8000. Is the second write ignored by the MMC1, or is it taken in account.
<br />
<br />Also you didn't mention the possibility for the shift register to be clocked by R/W AND /ROMSEL
<br />
<br />If this were to be the case, R/W would not go high between two consecutive writes, so this means the shift register is not clocked. But if you do what you experimented, that is, if I understood it well, toggle both M2 and R/W (but keep R/W low during write cycles when M2 is high) then the shift register will ignore writes even though R/W is cycling, because /ROMSEL is held low.
<br />
<br />I didn't understand the last bug you mentionned at all. It sounds completely new to me.
<br />
<br />I'll definitely fix my logisim model when this MMC1 behavior will get definitive.
