This is probably not accurate in itself, but based on accurate statistics to change the number in real times using <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_approximation" class="postlink">linear approximation</a>, so, unfortunately, it should not be that wrong.<br />Yes the updating numbers are frightening, especially the amount of people that are hungry and don't have acess to water. 3 times more births than deaths can't be a good thing either (not that I don't like children but I'm speaking for natural resources).<br />When I see the number of people that don't have acess to safe drinking water increase I immagine the guy oppening up the faucet and nothing comes out... probably not accurate but still terrible.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">tepples wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">Definitions of "overweight" based on body mass index are nothing to be worried about.

<br />True, and I'm pretty sure I have much less muscles than the average fellow <img src="./images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" alt=":(" title="Sad" />

<br />It wouldn't work. Here in Brazil for example the government does (or used to do, I'm not really following) this really stupid thing where they give a certain amount of money per child to poor families, and another amount for each child in school.
<br />
<br />This is supposed to help poor families and improve education, but guess what happens? People have more kids on purpose to get more money! And I doubt those kids are raised well with parents like that.

<br />
<br />Life is very painful, yes.  I subscribe to the theory that nobody should do more reproductively than replace themselves [or less].  So far, so good.  After all, I have two kids and can't imagine being able to handle more.  Then I go to work and there are people with 8 - 11 kids!
<br />
<br />I found the "end of oil" and "end of gas" numbers most troublesome.  That, and the fact that oil and food are "linked" -- but how valid is that link if it is just two graphs that appear to have the same profile over time?  In 42+some years will planes fly?

<br />We can live without oil and gas just fine. I'd worry about water and air pollution.
