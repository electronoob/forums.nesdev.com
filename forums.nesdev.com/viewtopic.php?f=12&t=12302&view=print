On hardware, the game has to reconfigure the <a href="http://problemkaputt.de/fullsnes.htm#snesmemorycontrol" class="postlink">SNES to address ROM at the faster speed</a>, and even then, only some of it. ($808000-$BFFFFF and $C00000-$FFFFFF)

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />No, see previous answer.  To use FastROM, you simply set bit 0 of $420D to 1, after which any CPU access (not DMA) to the FastROM region will be 6 clocks per byte instead of 8.<br /><br />This means that if you want your code to speed up noticeably, you need to point the program counter at the FastROM region; this is usually done with <tt style="margin-left: 2px; margin-right: 2px; padding:3px; background-color: #3355aa; color: white;">jml</tt>.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />The internal header specifies whether Nintendo was informed that the game needed to be produced using 120ns ROMs. Nothing more... unless the game itself checks the bytes in the header and uses that information to decide whether to do those two things. That'd be silly, though, because they know the header they were going to include, so there's no reason to conditionally relocate the code.

Changing bank numbers at assembly time (i.e. using constants) probably would have been a better idea though, yeah (but you never know what a programmer could decide is easier to implement).

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />The speed difference between SlowROM and FastROM in a game that suffers slowdown may not be significant enough to have a positive effect anyway. <br /><br />Remember that the SNES CPU does not run at 2.68mhz or 3.58mhz. It changes all the time meaning the average rate it somewhere between those two numbers. FastROM means that those cycles which read FastROM are slightly faster. But all your RAM access is still &quot;slow&quot;. Even in SlowROM you'll have the CPU running at &quot;Fast&quot; speed for some percentage of the cycles. <br /><br />There is a boost in performance but it's not a huge one. Maybe if a game was just *barely* going over the cpu frame time then by using FastROM you could eliminate that slowdown. psycopathicteen said that Gradius III which suffers slowdown is pretty unoptimized. Which sounds like FastROM alone wouldn't even come close to relieving the slowdown issues.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I don't see how this is possible with a single utility or program, i.e. there's no 100% reliable way to &quot;analyse a ROM file&quot; and accomplish this.<br /><br />The only way this would work is through an actual emulator, where it had some heuristics and logic to keep track of lots and lots of data and let you reverse-engineer its collected data from there.  Think of it FCEUX's Code/Data Logger, just with a different purpose.<br /><br />My opinion is generally the same as MottZilla's.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I thought someone was making a disassembler that starts with the boot vector, and takes all possible routes in code (back tracing, etc) and builds out a disassembly. If you took that approach, you should be able to reliably (or close as possible) be able to identify the opcodes you want to change. Unless code is dynamically built in ram, then this would fail for that part.<br /><br /> The other method was what koitsu mentioned. Using a data code logger, you map out the entire rom as you play through the game. The CD log/file tells you if a specific byte is the first for an instruction, so you get alignment for disassembly. I think Bizhawk emulator supports SNES (can't remember, it has CDL for other consoles beside NES).<br /><br /> Or do the last method and have an app scan for whatever target opcode. Set boundaries (like obvious data areas), and maybe add a simple check to look at opcodes before after the match, to see if it's a false positive (you'll mostly likely still get false positives). <br /><br />Though that assumes it's just simple JSR/Jmp opcodes to change, and not something weird like building addresses in ram that you jump indirectly from, or weird stack pushing/popping stuffs.<br /><br /> I would just pick one game to work on, using any of the methods above to assist, instead of trying an automatic conversion route.
