<br />Don't write over any "broken" disks! With some persistence I've managed to read dozens of err 22,24,27 disks. If you want to verify your dumps, open them with a hex editor, it will be easy to see if you're on the right track.

<br />
<br />Yeah, definitley don't delete "bad" disks, unless you really don't want the data on it and/or have already backed up the data on it.  If it's a bad read, chances are the data is in there, more than likely, just your drive isn't in tip-top shape to read it.  Sometimes an overwrite can help remagnetize the disk, but make sure you've attempted to backed it up first.
<br />
<br />As far as I know, you can only write the WHOLE disk, not parts of it, so unlike floppies, it really is best to be sure with these before you go overwriting them.  It's just the way the Quickdisk format was designed.  Well, I suppose this puts save files into question though....unless of course, the whole game and the save file is rewritten at the same time every time a save file is saved...I'm not sure actually.  Maybe someone knows this?

<br />
<br />Well, like I said, I didn't think it could do that...my understanding was that the QD format takes an all or nothing approach.  With the disk side already in RAM, I guess it would make sense if it wrote the whole side with the save file over at the same time...kind of a crappy way of doing it, but my understanding was that the qd format just isn't that dynamic, which is why it never really caught on in too many computers.  It was faster, but not too versatile.
<br />
<br />Of course, any corrections to my notions of its writing techniques are most welcome.

<br />
<br />I received parts for the CopyNES kits/boards/etc... and boards are still on order.  I haven't gotten an update yet on PCB production, so once I get that I will forward it.  
<br />
<br />I socketed my CopyNES BIOS and added the 6502 emulator stuff to it last night and have used it successfully to reverse engineer a 'copy protected' fami cart!  It worked much better than I could ever have hoped.  
<br />
<br />The cart in question is "Earthworm Jim 2".  It used just absolutely stupid levels of protection in the code, including 3 hash routines, dynamic code generation, and lots of other crap.  Long story short, the game now runs in Nintendulator.  I made a text file with info on how it was cracked, complete with a commented disassembly and such:

<br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://tripoint.org/kevtris/mappers/incoming/ewj2prot.txt">http://tripoint.org/kevtris/mappers/inc ... j2prot.txt</a><!-- m -->
<br />
<br />After doing this, I found a few things I will change in the emulator to make it work even better...  
<br />
<br />BTW, does anyone have a working Panda Prince fami "pirate original" cart?  I have one, but it doesn't work any more.  It uses a similar protection to this EWJ2 cart.  I have a ROM dump I made before the cart died, but it does me no good without a working cart.  I just need to borrow it for awhile to trace the code in a similar fashion to this EWJ2.

<br />You can write parts of the disk, but the drive does have to make a full pass every time since it can't seek.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Why do pirate companies design such ridiculously complicated copy protection schemes?  Do they do it as exercises in electrical engineering and 6502 coding?  Are they afraid that Nintendo or the third party they stole the game from will have an easier time suing them in court with the code?  Are they afraid of people distributing their ROMs and played on emulators instead of buying cartridges?  Or is it to stop competitors from including their hacked game on their competitors cartridges?
<br />
<br />I think the first and last are by far the most likely.  I don't know what the profits are like on pirate cartridges, but I can't imagine them being very high.  Nintendo rarely goes after pirates these days because they are hard to find and track down.  Back in the day, they could prove an infringement case without the code, all they have to do was to show the similarities during gameplay.  
<br />
<br />I am sure even pirates take pride in their convoluted schemes.  Equally, they don't appreciate the competition in the next two-bit factory over putting out the cartriges they worked so hard to port to the 8-bit hardware.  The joys of a free market!

<br />
<br />Yeah... It's pretty ironic- the pirates write an original game instead of just copying it, and now they want to prevent OTHER pirates from copying it!!!  That's the long and short of it I think.
<br />
<br />Also yah I downloaded the copy of it you have which was hacked for MMC3 from what I remember.  The game seems to use what I call the "submapper" (gotten thru regs at 5800 and 5801) to do the protection routines, and then they switch it off and go with the regular "MMC3" after the protection is done (vectoring all writes to it through RAM to prevent easy hacking).  So a determined hacker probably wouldn't have too much trouble porting it to MMC3.   Though, the MMC3 it uses has the register writes moved around!  The registers are not in the normal order.   The just had to make life a bit more "interesting" I guess.
<br />
<br />Oh yeah I still have those sachen games I need to send you and some other stuff.  I lost your email addy since I moved.  BTW do you think I could borrow your Panda Prince cart some time so I can figure that protection out?  Doing EWJ2 was kind of a test to see how well I could break this kind of protection, and it looks like it was a success.
