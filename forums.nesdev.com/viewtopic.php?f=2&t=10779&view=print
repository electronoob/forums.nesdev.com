		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />The kiss of death for a two-player hack would be one player taking the wrong path in 4-4; there's no way to work around that without breaking the game rules.  Both players would have to cooperate on every little movement to make the screen scroll properly.  What might be interesting is a PC remake where the playfield stretches between both players ala NSMB Wii, but even that could look funky with the pattern castles, or just take the uncreative way out and do a split-screen ala Sonic 2.

With 4 screens you could even keep PPU updates mostly untouched, and an IRQ could be used to split the screen. Lowering the height of the viewport shouldn't cause much trouble, seeing as SMB DX did it successfully.<br /><br />Palettes would still be an issue, and the positions for active sprites would have to be calculated twice, which could result in slowdowns. In fact, slowdowns should be a big concern, since the game already slows down as is.<br /><br />BTW, I know you probably suggested this for a remake, but I figured it would be fun to consider something like this on the NES.

(Also, having an IRQ available for the split would make it a lot easier on you.)

That's not even enough to show the top of Mario's jump curve. Mario jumps 4 m tall from still and about 5 m tall from running; combine that with Mario's 2 m height, and you'd need to scroll on every jump. Sonic 3 solves this by using separate multiplayer maps that are scaled differently, but that would introduce attribute problems unless some simpler-than-MMC5 circuit for ExGrafix can be invented.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">rainwarrior wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">Also, having an IRQ available for the split would make it a lot easier on you</div><br />A simple split halfway down the map is the poster child for a DMC IRQ split.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />The game I'm doing now has New Super Mario Bros. style co-op. Two players on one screen, they can stomp/shoot/grab each other. Game scrolls like a sonic game (eight way scrolling). The scrolling is an average of their positions, if they get too far apart, neither player can progress further horizontally. (There are more complex rules for when they get vertically far apart, but that wouldn't be an issue in Super Mario Bros.)<br /><br />Now, you could just keep the players from making the screen go further backwards like the original, which solves the &quot;what has been destroyed issue.&quot; You could also just save bits for that stuff in WRAM, it sounds like a total non issue to me. <br /><br />Far jumps would suck when player 2 is keeping you from scrolling, yes, and the castle mazes would need to be changed or require extreme cooperative maneuvers yes. But nothing about the project seems that far fetched, since I'm already doing most of it in a brand new game. It would just take a lot of time. Really, the only thing that &quot;saves&quot; my game from the far jump issues (and would actually save it from the maze issue too) is that the players can pick each other up. So if your partner can't make a jump, you can just carry him across it. Or carry him across the maze level. Super Mario World added this sort of grabbing for enemies, I'd just add it to SMB for co-op players.

It's in fact closer to 32 m wide according to my measurement of a screenshot on Amazon.com, so multiplayer might need to be zoomed out like Super Mario Land. Use Mario's graphic from SML, put him on a diet to get Luigi, and use Toad from Wario's Woods to make Yvan and Wolley. This would require an attribute clash workaround, such as moving pipes to coincide with 2x2 m boundaries. Anyone up for a mockup of a few screens of SMB1 redrawn with 8x8 pixel metatiles?<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">Really, the only thing that &quot;saves&quot; my game from the far jump issues (and would actually save it from the maze issue too) is that the players can pick each other up.</div><br />You mean like how Chip carries Dale?<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">So if your partner can't make a jump, you can just carry him across it.
