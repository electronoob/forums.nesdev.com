<br />i've also done an 80186 PC emulator but i did it on linux/windows PC host so i had a lot more power to work with. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />
<br />
<br />man you've got a serious task ahead of you if you want to emulate a NES at full speed on that CPU, it might be not possible honestly. the guy who did flea86 also wants to do a NES emulator now, you guys should compare notes... he hangs out on my IRC server most nights. the address is irc.rubbermallet.org channel #wtfpwnt
<br />
<br />his nick there is usually Flea86 or Valentin.

<br />
<br />I don't have Metroid running right now, (though it's probably some other problem - fails on undoc opcode). What does the disable prg-ram bit actually do? Right now I always map in 8k of "ram" at $6000. I don't understand what the alternative is.

<br />
<br />always mapping it in shouldnt hurt anything afaik, but the disable PRG-RAM does what it sounds like. it makes it so there is no RAM accessable at $6000. it just makes $6000-$7FFF open bus.
<br />
<br />just ignore writes to there, and read is undefined. in my emulator it just read zeros from there when it's disabled.

<br />for a brief period i had the WRAM always accessible even if MMC1 tries to disable it, but metroid still worked just fine.

<br />
<br />It's definitely possible, although not on an 8-bit micro like the flea86 (very cool btw) <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /> The main constraint is RAM size, so I have two options really. Either add external memory and use an AVR32 (or ARM, but that's sorta been done with pocketnes), or have limited game support (&lt;=96k) and use a PIC32 or dsPIC (mapper 0 only). I'm using the 8052 board for the moment cause I have a video controller on it I can play with that I may end up having to use on the real board.
<br />
<br />Here's a prototype of an <a href="http://www.azosoft.com/armtendo.jpg" class="postlink">ARM+CPLD</a>board I made like 5 years ago but never wrote the emulator for. Depending on how portable the code turns out I may go back and finish that one too <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />

<br />
<br />I think (but I'm not sure) the FDS BIOS has already cleared all the memory after booting so memory initialisation is not required for games. In fact, you should not even initialise (all) the memory yourself as you may have wiped clean some of the addresses reserved by the BIOS.
<br />
<br />Possibly the porters forgot about this when they adapt the game to cartridge format.
