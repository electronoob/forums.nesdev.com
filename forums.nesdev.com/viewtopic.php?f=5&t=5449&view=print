Not to be rude but there is so much out there and its most important for us to find our places in the real world. Not everyone has a place but you still gotta try.

But it's your family with their own set of social values/ethics and measurements, and any of our advice probably won't be of any <em>real</em> help since each family is different. For instance, my ex believed 100% that all hobbies are totally useless and meaningless. You could probably guess <em>why</em> she's an "ex" <img src="./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" /> One thing you should look at, if anyone in your family "reads" as much as you do your hobby (i.e. bookworms). You might be able to persuade them and give credit to your hobby by drawing the parallels.
<br />
<br /> Hobbies in and of themselves are a way for you to live out your personal dreams and goals and can be key to personal growth or just a way of balancing yourself. Sometimes, for whatever reasons, our dreams/goals just aren't compatible/suitable/implementable as a job option and a hobby option fills that void. But like anything (even a job), too much time can be a bad thing. It looks like your families perception of your balancing of hobby and other activities are not in line with your own.
<br />
<br /> I'm not sure how old you are, but when I was a teenager - I'm <em>sure</em> my parents would have loved my staying home with such a productive hobby VS going out and getting into/causing <em>all sorts of trouble</em> (which I did).

<br />
<br />Some people, especially old people, don't understand computers. They seem to believe that when you sit at the computer you are automatically doing something pointless and unproductive simply because they don't understand what you are doing. So maybe you should try to explain it to them and when they don't understand because it is too complicated maybe they'll STFU.

<br />You correctly guessed that one of the critics is nearly old enough to draw US Medicare. But I'm trying to understand my cousin's motivations so that I can explain them.

<br />
<br />However if the problem is that you are <em>supposed</em> to be working on something more substantial to earn a living like them...well, being an accomplished coder definitely belongs on a resume.  Assembly shows dedication and detail-oriented work, and intense logic.  Good practice for solving many real world problems.
<br />
<br />Suppose you were spending all day building computers and installing OSs, would they frown on that?  Because that is definitely a livelihood right there.  If you can imagine that this wouldn't satisfy them either, then you can dismiss their concerns as lacking a basic understanding of IT related jobs.

<br />I wouldn't discount NES development at all.  I know it's just an anecdote, but I had my NES work on my resume, and when I was doing an (excruciating!) job search a couple years ago I actually got called into an interview for an amazingly high-paying and very cushy job at the Hoosier Lottery for running/watching over their huge IBM server.  The guy specifically said he understood that I didn't have any knowledge at all about their system, and had no employment history, but it was mostly because my NES-related experience that he even considered me for the job.  Well I didn't get that job, unfortunately I imagine they found someone with experience, certifications, etc.  But still, my demonstrated knowledge in an obscure field got me an interview that I didn't realistically expect to get!  During most of my search I didn't have any mention of it, that was more when was I getting desperate after a long while.
<br />
<br />I know you've put a lot of time and effort into NES development, so really if you do work this into your resume (and you should), I'd be happy to PM you my full contact information to use as a reference.  I use your apps all the time and refer others to them, I've given you "promotions" on the forum here, it'd be a good reference I think.
