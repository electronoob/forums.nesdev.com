		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />The <a href="https://wiki.nesdev.com/w/index.php/Action_53_mapper" class="postlink">Action 53 mapper</a> is an ASIC mapper of roughly MMC1-class complexity, implemented on CPLD cartridges sold by Infinite NES Lives. It was originally designed for making multicarts of games using common discrete mappers (NROM, CNROM, UNROM, ANROM, BNROM). It can also be used by a single game that takes full control of the mapper to switch both PRG ROM and CHR RAM banks at runtime by changing register select at CPU $5000. Its division of register numbers into &quot;supervisor&quot; and &quot;user&quot; registers anticipated games using full control, but with one caveat: switching between horizontal and vertical mirroring requires a supervisor write, as does initialization at startup.<br /><br />But now people want to make games using its advanced features <em>and</em> get them included on a multicart. This is possible with a 1-byte patch so long as the game never changes the outer bank register ($81) after startup and always writes the correct log(prgsize/32768) value to bits 5-4 of the mode register ($80).<br /><br />In <a href="https://forums.nesdev.com/viewtopic.php?p=207950#p207950" class="postlink">this post</a>, INL suggested developing an extended discrete mapper that allows switching PRG, CHR, and mirroring without having to write to supervisor registers $80 and $81 or even to register select. I proposed basing it on <a href="https://wiki.nesdev.com/w/index.php/INES_Mapper_078" class="postlink">mapper 78</a>, variants of which are used by IREM's <em>Holy Diver</em> (78.3) and <em>Uchuusen: Cosmo Carrier</em> (78.1), and making it tweakable using the mode register to resemble <a href="https://wiki.nesdev.com/w/index.php/INES_Mapper_011" class="postlink">mapper 11</a> used by Color Dreams games. Thus an additional user mode of an expanded Action 53 mapper would have this layout at $8000-$FFFF:<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">7654 3210<br />&nbsp; CC MPPP<br />&nbsp; || |+++- Set low 3 bits of PRG inner bank<br />&nbsp; || +---- Set mirroring mode bit 0 (inverted: 1 writes 0; 0 writes 1)<br />&nbsp; ++------ Set CHR bank<br /></div><br />The inversion is there because the sense of bit 3 on the Holy Diver board is like that of the iNES header (0=PA11, 1=PA10), which is inverted compared to that of FDS, MMC1-4, VRC2/4/7, FME-7, and both Action 52 and Action 53 (0=PA10, 1=PA11).<br /><br />How this would work:<br /><br /><ul><li><strong>32K PRG banks</strong><br />Similar to mapper 11, except with mapper-controlled mirroring (either H/V or 1-screen) instead of CIC stun control. (<a href="http://bootgod.dyndns.org:7777/search.php?ines=11&amp;mirroring=Horizontal" class="postlink">Only two commercial-era games using this mapper</a> have horizontal mirroring; the rest have vertical mirroring.) This allows accessing all four CHR RAM banks and the entirety of a 256 KiB outer bank.</li><li><strong>16K PRG banks, game up to 128 KiB</strong><br />This behaves like either variant of mapper 78, except CHR RAM is limited to 32 KiB.</li><li><strong>16K PRG banks, 256 KiB</strong><br />Because there are only three PRG ROM bank select bits, a game needs to select UNROM (write $01 to $5000), change bit 3 of the inner bank number, and select mapper 78 again. But as long as the game doesn't need to change between 16K and 32K modes or between H/V and 1-screen mirroring, this eliminates the need to write to supervisor registers after startup.</li></ul><br />INL's counterproposal was to add a mode equivalent to MMC3. He pointed out that the cost of doing so is negligible given all the 5.0 V to 3.3 V level shifting needed to use a PRG ROM larger than 4 Mbit (512Kx8). This would behave similarly to TGROM (<em>Mega Man 4</em>; <em>Mega Man 6</em>; <em>Ninja Crusaders</em>) and the expanded TGROM used by <em>The Curse of Possum Hollow</em>, which would in theory let Retrotainment submit the demo of <em>Curse</em> as a free-for-all in volume 4.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />While I think your proposal would work Tepples, the thing it appears to lack is ability to change between 16KB and 32KB PRG-ROM bankswitching.  I don't see how it helps basing directly off the other mappers when emulators don't support CHR-RAM for mapper 11.<br /><br />There are a couple problems that we're looking to solve here:<br />1- Allow compo entries access extra hardware available on cartridge.  At a minimum this includes bank switched 32KB CHR-RAM, and selectable mirroring.<br />2- Simplify the mapper requirement for the compo beyond 'mapper 28' compatible, which is hard to translate to entrant's mapper choices.<br /><br />My first proposal of a new discrete mapper similar to Tepples' proposal is an option, but it then creates a new problem that development tools (emulators) don't support this new mapper.  Sure support could be added to FCEUX, but it's unlikely to be a fast nor simple process.<br /><br />Last compo we exceeded 4mbit of data which is the threshold for which 5v parallel memory can be purchased cost effectively.  Going past 4mbit makes 3v memory the only viable solution, and once we've done that, we've now unlocked a 3v CPLD/mapper with ~200 cells.  Doing that, allows the compo mapper access to MMC3 scale logic at no additional cost.  The added cost was paid when we jumped from 4mbit to 8mbit rom.<br /><br />So with that, perhaps the best solution is we simply add MMC3 to the list of available mappers for compo entrants.  Any emulator that supports nes 2.0 will allow development with 32KB CHR-RAM.  Altenatively CHR-ROM could be utilized which is supported by nearly all emus.  This also provides significantly more mapper features to entries, I'm not sure if this would be good or not.  Some may feel they didn't adequately make use of available hardware, or that things aren't on quite the same level playing field between entries that do and don't utilize the MMC3.<br /><br />I don't know how this proposal would affect the menu's responsiblity/challenges.  Initially I expected use of MMC3 might promote less efficient use of rom.  But MMC3's increased bank granulatity might actually help keep entries condensed.<br /><br />So I'm still not sure what the best answer is exactly.  Maybe the current setup is best, and we're proposing repairs to something that's not broken after all.  Curious what compo entrants think about all this...

This way someone with  a soldering iron, a Color Dreams cartridge, a spare flash or UV EPROM, spare 32Kx8 SRAM (e.g. 62256), and a CIC modded NES could flash Holy Mapperel and verify that the combination of 64K of PRG ROM, 32K of CHR ROM, and mapper 11 is valid.

Currently it runs in the same oversize BNROM mode it ran in since before mapper 28 existed, only switching to the particular game's preferred mode before jumping to it. The menu would just need some flag to tell which games are MMC3.
