Then use this to properly determine the thermals on die so you can assess the rate of degradation and statistical probability of permanent or intermittent failure associated with age of the CPU and number if run time hours logged.  Oh, and don't forget to consider  ambient temperature and process variation based on CPU revision.

In the menus, right below &quot;Power&quot; should be &quot;Towel trick&quot;, &quot;Repair heat sink&quot;, &quot;Fire extinguisher&quot;, etc.

The emulator doesn't need to have fire in it and so on.

Some mappers are <em>capable</em> of conflicts, but proper programming can avoid them. That is, never write a value to ROM unless it matches what's in ROM at that byte. One way to ensure this is to first read from that byte, then write it back. That way a bug will result in the wrong bank rather than a hidden conflict.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />If a true bus conflict occurs you should be notified ideally by the emulator. All the commercial games, barring some bug, were programmed to be aware of bus conflicts and avoid them properly. The concern would be you could write homebrew for one of these mappers such as UNROM or CNROM and constantly cause conflicts that could damage to hardware.

Still, it should be useful for the emulator to have some bus conflict counter so that you can see if you have a bug in your program (or if you want to examine if any commercial games are doing this).
