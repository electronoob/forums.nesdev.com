		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Hello there,<br /><br />I played some NES games using Micro Genius (I'm in SE Asia) when I was just a little kid, and then much later in my life, I'm into the PC world. Plus, I did a lot of microcontroller projects in my free time too.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I can't find my Micro Genius anymore, prolly it was disposed. So I happened to have bumped into eBay one day and found those PPU clones sold cheaply, which are the UMC 6538. I assumed it's the same as the NES's one, so I'm just wondering, would it ever work if I connect it to, say, an Atmega644 (or PIC18F), plus some 62256 SRAM in my drawer? Could I write some commands in the microcontroller first and coax it to display a tile/sprite or something on a TV?<br /><br />Or, should I really need to pair it with the 6502?

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Thanks for all the opinions. I thought it may seem impossible at start, but it's actually do-able. Right now all I can get is the new (or new old stocks) clone versions of these PPUs as the original ones are dead expensive.<br /><br />I've read a bit about the 6502 - and it seems the modern 8-bit microcontrollers are much faster and convenient than this 6502, except the microcontrollers have fixed amounts of flash ROM. I may need to wait for the PPU to come as I'm buying from eBay and it ships from China.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />80/3 = 26.6667 MHz is about 1 part in 400 off from the true 26.6017. That'll work great for black and white. But to avoid rainbowing at the right side, you'll need the difference in subcarrier phase to be less than (guessing) 1/20 of a cycle by the right side. Now phase is the integral of frequency, and over the 52 microseconds of each scanline, there are about 230 cycles of the subcarrier. This means the frequency difference needs to be less than about 1 part in 5000.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />For NTSC, you won't be able to find 6× crystals either. You're going to have to build or buy a PLL or some other frequency multiplier regardless of the PPU you use.<br /><br />Here's a non-PLL solution using a 4x clock source (I know that crystal frequency is available). It divides by 2, then multiplies by three:<div class="attachtitle">Attachment:</div><div class="attachcontent">

		<br />
	</div><br />If you change the frequency you drive it at (e.g. switching to NTSC), you'll need to change the LC. (2π√(L·C) = desired output frequency, and that needs to be an odd multiple of the input frequency)<br />You'll probably want to put a trim capacitor or trimmable inductor. A PLL should be less fiddly.

My interfacing attempt has been very slow due to work and stuff.<br /><br />I got these 26.601712MHz crystals finally from ebay, and unfortunately it's not a direct standalone oscillator, so I have to couple this crystal with another few components to make it complete.<br /><br />Would using the chip inverter (not gate) and a few caps generate the intended 26.601712MHz clock? All I know that I can't use the CD4069 because it's too slow.<br /><br />Or, should I use the transistor ones for better stability?<br /><br />Love to hear the opinions. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />
