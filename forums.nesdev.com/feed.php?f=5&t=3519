My SNES is braindead this morning.  I went to play some games on it, and I was welcomed with graphical glitch galore.  I went as far as to take the thing apart and reset the cartridge connector, even reversing it, but no change in behavior.<br /><br />Symptoms are as follows:<br />Street Fighter II:  No title screen graphic, just a bunch of huge flickering pixels...  (as it tries to do the special effect, then the graphic disapears all together)..  Game itself still plays fine..<br /><br />The Lion King:  Background sometimes loses place, and just bounces back and forth horizontally, like it's forgetting where it's supposed to be..  Random freezes also occur.<br /><br />Super Mario World:  Game runs fine with only the oddity of the screen flashing brighter sometimes, only 1 frame out of 60 frames, and completely random.  Seems to only happen at the world map.<br /><br />Unless someone here knows what this means, I think my SNES is braindead, and is ready to die on me, which would stink, because this was a "rescued" SNES (previous owner trashed it very badly, he was a Sony fan...)<br /><br />I was going to get Castlevania, Dracula X for it, but I'm afraid that game wouldn't run at all, with all the graphical effects it does...<br /><br />Oh, and I did check the power supply..  Working fine..<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3325">evildragon</a> — Mon Aug 06, 2007 12:47 pm</p><hr />
