		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Hi...
<br />
<br />Today nodeNES is out. It is a c6502 compiler in javascript. It's in more than alpha stage, but it is fully capable for compiling and running (with JSNES) some demos.
<br />
<br />You can take a look at: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://gutomaia.net/nodeNES/">http://gutomaia.net/nodeNES/</a><!-- m -->
<br />
<br />The source code is hosted at github. If you have your own demo or code snippet and you wish to post along with other demos of nodeNES.
<br />
<br />You can fork add the demo and open a pull request, or if you don't know how to do it you can talk to me and I will certanelly help you.
<br />
<br />Thanks, and have fun!

<br />The tile editor could use a little polishing, but this is still pretty well put together. I hope to see it developed further.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Agreed -- neat, and convenient.  Might make for a useful development tool, quite honestly.  Sure takes the common annoyances out of writing code + testing.
<br />
<br />If you wanted something to focus on however, it would be that running something takes up 100% CPU (of a single core); so someone very likely has a while(1) {} loop of some sort.  Surely there is a better way to do it than that, but I know jack squat about Javascript (other than I avoid it :P).

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />@mikejmoffitt Thanks... I will certanlly polish it. Like I said, it is in pre-alpha stage. However it's already compiling a lot of stuff. Sorry for the minnor bugs. I will pimp it a little along this week.
<br />
<br />@koitsu I've notive the running problem. However, that problem mostly is a emulator stuff. Two commum problems that I have:
<br />1) I'm recompiling and reloading the code at every 5 second pause on the source editor. Problem is that NOT every source is a valid nes game. I need to put a checkbox to disable the auto-run
<br />2) My compiler does yeild for several types of erros. I sould prompt it on the screen.  So the developer could focus on that his is doing, and doing it write.
<br />
<br />Anyway... thanks!
<br />
<br />I hope I could use it for tutorials and those kind of stuff... Do you guys have any DEMO code that I could post along nodeNES? Right now the code dosen't work if a lot of mappers. The could was build all with TDD. So, it has tests for everything. And I didn't have fixture example with every kind of mapper. Examples are always welcome.
<br />
<br />You can also post Issues on github, or even help me fix them!
<br />
<br />thanks again

<br />Wow, that is a fantactic example. However the example deals with some directives that my compiler dosen't seem prepared yet. Like .include .import  .segment and .exportzp.
<br />
<br />Include would be very simple to implement. However, I don't know what import and exportzp does. The segment directive is another issue. With that you use you need to compile parts of the code to mount then latter. Or use a precompiler to catch and call .org at certain places, but it can be made.
<br />
<br />In fact, it only seems that I need to know what .import and .exportzp does.
<br />
<br />Nice example!

<br />They're to allow different translation units (that is, different .s files) to share symbols while keeping others private.
<br /><ul><li>.export makes a symbol defined in this file visible to other translation units. </li><li>.import allows using symbols that another translation unit has exported, with the actual value subbed in later once all translation units have been loaded. </li><li>.global acts like .export if the symbol was defined here and .import if it was not. </li><li>.importzp, .exportzp, and .globalzp act the same but also involve an assumption that the value is $00-$FF, allowing use of 1-byte instructions. A symbol exported with zp can be imported without it but not vice versa. </li></ul>For other directives see the <a href="http://www.cc65.org/doc/ca65.html" class="postlink">ca65 users guide</a>.<br /><br />If your assembler works by .include'ing all source code files instead of producing object files and linking them later, here's a workaround: <ul><li>Prepend the .s file's name to all top-level symbols that aren't imported or exported. </li><li>Collect lines by what segment they're in, and then reorder them by segment. (Lines before the first .segment are in .segment "CODE".) </li><li>Apply an appropriate .org before each segment. </li></ul>

<br />
<br />Is that a feature expected from an IDE?  Personally I find it strange having to wait for some event to trigger a compile.  In my IDE I toyed with background compiling to highlight code errors as you were coding; I thought that actually loading and trying to run what you'd created might be too much because typically you'd expect the user might be stopped at a breakpoint and just trying things.
<br />
<br />Oh and how do I save what I've created?
