		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Hello all,
<br />
<br />I am using asm6, and had a few questions.
<br />
<br />1) .base seems to take the place of .bank - for some reason it doesn't recognize the .bank directives, does this sound correct?
<br />
<br />2) when I try to do .org $0000 directly in front of my .incbin graphics.chr file, it complains.  Am I missing something (if I remove this code, it creates the desired .nes file).
<br />
<br />3) I'd like to use the MMC3 mapper for multiple banks of chr files and program code.  Would I make seperate files and include those like this:
<br />...
<br />.bank 4
<br />.incbin extraProgramCodeBank1.asm
<br />.bank 5
<br />.incbin extraProgramCodeBank2.asm
<br />.bank 6
<br />.incbin graphics3.chr
<br />.bank 7
<br />.incbin graphics4.chr
<br />.bank 8
<br />.incbin graphics5.chr
<br />...
<br />
<br />Would this work, and are there other methods?
<br />
<br />
<br />Thank you!

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />To handle multiple banks in ASM6 I have a ".base" statement at the start of every bank, and a ".pad" at the end.
<br />
<br />So, a bank that is mapped at $8000-$a000 looks like this:
<br />
<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">&nbsp; &nbsp;.base $8000<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;;bank contents go here<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;.pad $a000</div><br />A bank mapped at $e000-$ffff (which contains the CPU vectors) looks like this:<br /><br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">&nbsp; &nbsp;.base $e000<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;;bank contents go here<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;.pad $fffa<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;;CPU vectors go here</div>
<br />
<br />If your whole program is in a single file (highly unrecommended for large programs), just write the banks one after the other. If each bank has it's own file, just include them all on the master file.
<br />
<br />About the graphics files, try using ".base" insted of ".org".

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Thanks for the reply, and that modification seemed to work.  So .base takes the place of these 2 directives?
<br />.bank ___
<br />.org ___
<br />
<br />Then how do you switch in a new bank with the MMC3?  Let's say that you have filled up your first four - 8KB PRG-ROM banks with .base &amp; .pad, and now you have an additional bank (seperate file).  What is the address you would use for the .base directive, since you have to specifiy that address in $8001 to do the switch?

<br />
<br />Here's what a ROM with 8 8KB banks (64KB or PRG-ROM) could look like:
<br />
<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">&nbsp; &nbsp;;header<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;.org $7ff0<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;;iNES header goes here<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;.pad $8000, $00<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;;bank 0 &#40;will be mapped at $8000-$9FFF&#41;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;.base $8000<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;;bank contents go here<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;.pad $a000<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;;bank 1<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;.base $8000 &#40;will be mapped at $8000-$9FFF&#41;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;;bank contents go here<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;.pad $a000<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;;bank 2<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;.base $8000 &#40;will be mapped at $8000-$9FFF&#41;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;;bank contents go here<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;.pad $a000<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;;bank 3<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;.base $8000 &#40;will be mapped at $8000-$9FFF&#41;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;;bank contents go here<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;.pad $a000<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;;bank 4<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;.base $a000 &#40;will be mapped at $a000-$BFFF&#41;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;;bank contents go here<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;.pad $c000<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;;bank 5<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;.base $a000 &#40;will be mapped at $a000-$BFFF&#41;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;;bank contents go here<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;.pad $c000<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;;bank 6<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;.base $c000 &#40;will be fixed at $C000-$DFFF&#41;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;;bank contents go here<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;.pad $e000<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;;bank 7<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;.base $e000 &#40;will be fixed at $E000-$FFFF&#41;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;;bank contents go here<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;.pad $fffa<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;;CPU vectors go here</div><br />Of course your layout might be a little different depending on where each bank will be mapped to, but the values you use in the <strong>.base</strong> and <strong>.pad</strong> directives are always related to where the bank will be mapped to, it has nothing to do with where in the ROM file it is.<br /><br />One thing I like to do that helps me with the bank indexes is having a symbol hold the bank index, and I increment it between banks, like this:<br /><br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">&nbsp; &nbsp;BankIndex = 0<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;;bank 0 &#40;will be mapped at $8000-$9FFF&#41;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;.base $8000<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;;bank contents go here<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;.pad $a000<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;BankIndex = BankIndex + 1<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;;bank 1<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;.base $8000 &#40;will be mapped at $8000-$9FFF&#41;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;;bank contents go here<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;.pad $a000<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;BankIndex = BankIndex + 1<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;;bank 2<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;.base $8000 &#40;will be mapped at $8000-$9FFF&#41;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;;bank contents go here<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;.pad $a000<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&#40;...&#41;</div><br />And so on. Then, inside the bank that contains the map of the first level, for example, I can do something like this:<br /><br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">&nbsp; &nbsp;FirstLevelBank = BankIndex</div>
<br />Then whenever I want to switch the bank with the level map I just use that symbol, so I never have to worry about actual bank numbers. And even if I move the banks around everything will still work fine.
<br />
<br />Anyway, after the PRG-ROM come the CHR-ROM banks. I think you don't even have to worry about <strong>.org</strong>'ing or <strong>.base</strong>'ing them anywhere, just <strong>.incbin</strong> all the tiles directly.

<br />
<br />Building on your example, would this work:
<br />
<br />Make some constants like so:
<br />LEVEL_1_BANK = 0
<br />LEVEL_2_BANK = 1
<br />Etc.
<br />
<br />;header
<br />
<br />.base $8000
<br />.include “level1.asm”
<br />.pad $A000
<br />
<br />.base $8000
<br />.include “level2.asm”
<br />.pad $A000
<br />Etc.
<br />
<br />
<br />;somewhere in the game code perform a bankswitch
<br />LDA #%00000110               
<br />STA $8000                       ;select $8000 - $A000
<br />LDA #LEVEL_2_BANK
<br />STA $8001                       ;bank switch
<br />
<br />
<br />Also, I was indeed planning to have $C000 - $FFFF fixed.  Does it matter which order you use the .base directive?  Can you use .base $C000 ahead of .base $8000 in your file?

<br />The order doesn't matter, you can do it like that.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />*edit* it may not have been necessary to add to tokumaru's already detailed explanation, but it helps solidify my own knowledge to throw in my own two cents as well so here I go...
<br />
<br />One thing that helped me in understanding assemblers is that some directives/comments cause the assembler to actually generate a byte that goes into your rom, and some only increment the program counter.  "reserving bytes" in zp or RAM only increments the program counter. Defining bytes and instructions BOTH increments the program counter AND places bytes into your file. So your game might be something like:
<br />
<br />.db 16 bytes of iNES header (these go into your ROM, and only the emulator or PowerPAK reads them, it never gets into the NES's "brain.")
<br />.org $0000
<br />label: .res 1  ;this increments the program counter to $0001, but your rom is still only 16 bytes
<br />
<br />.base $8000  ;still only 16 bytes, but now every label after here will be calculated counting from $8000.
<br />
<br />routine1:    ;this routine's address will be $8000
<br />
<br />  rts   ;this puts the rts instruction's opcode into your ROM. it is the 17th byte written to your file in this example.
<br />
<br />routine2:   ;this routine's address will be $8001 because the above rts generated a byte that went into your rom, thus incrementing the program counter
<br />rts
<br />
<br />
<br />.pad $bfff  ;this will spit out zeros into your rom until the specified program counter value is reached, thus filling out your first 16k PRG bank. now your rom is 16k + 16 bytes in size.
<br />
<br />.base C000  
<br />
<br />;more routines and data
<br />
<br />.pad $fffa
<br />;vectors as previously explained
<br />
<br />etc.
<br />
<br />The emulator or PowerPAK or what have you will know to take your first PRG rom and map those bytes to $8000 and take the second PRG rom and map those bytes to $C000, even though as an offset from your ROM file, the first PRG bank is really at $0000 to $3FFF (counting from after the 16 byte header...).  Does that make sense? And then the mapper (if you use one) will take care of pointing one or both of those banks at different PRG banks throughout your rom. You have to make sure whatever PRG bank you point at with your mapper was calculated from the correct base address though! You wouldn't want to point the non-fixed bank ($8000) at a PRG bank whose labels were all calculated counting from $C000! That would be bad.  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" />
