		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />In addition to the NES mainboard, the power adapter supplies power to the bridge rectifier and regulator, both of which use (waste) a significant amount of power.<br /><br />The regulator also likely has plenty of spare capacity for powering more things, and it and the power adapter can be pushed beyond their specs, so that doesn't give us much of an idea of how much the mainboard uses.<br /><br />These distinctions are why I'm curious as to the motivation behind the original question, what the poster plans on doing with this information.

Could anyone with a stick power brick and an ammeter measure it for me? I would prefer to match spec if possible. I have a few plugs to choose from,m and the one that is physically smallest does 5v DC @ 1.0A.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />The 7705 regulator needs at least 6.5VDC in input to correctly output 5VDC at it's output, and there is a diode rectifier before it that will probably drop around 1.4V. Therefore the NES could probably be powered at 8V DC, or 5.7V AC. I have not tested this though.

More will be needed for games with ASIC mappers, although I don't know how much. I also don't know how applicable this is to a front loader.
