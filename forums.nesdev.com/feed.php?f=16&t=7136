OK so in the end, I guess since we have no way of knowing if the unused pins on +5V or GND are unued /CE or /OE signals or not, the logic would say we should show the names of the singal leading to the pin.<br /><br />However, it seems more complicated to do it this way as it implies different pinouts for PRG and CHR.<br /><br />The other way to go, would be to make pinouts with only the name of the signals, that is "Ax", "Dx", "CE", "/CE", "/OE", and that's all. Unused signals would be still specified as "+5V" or "GND" as we can't be very sure of their usage.<br /><br />Because on most carts the /CE and /OE wiring is the same, a simple paragraph about it should be used, and exeptions (such as AOROM) should be mentionned next to the pinout (like it's already right now).<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=38">Bregalad</a> — Mon Nov 29, 2010 2:11 pm</p><hr />

I figured I'd join in on this discussion...for documenting board details I would think the best way to do it would be like most schematics I've worked with do.  At the top level you have chips and named signals between the chips (CPU_A15, for example).  Clicking on any chip in the design brings you to that chip's "page" where the chip is the only thing on it.  The board-level signal names surround the chip on the wires going into the chip.  Inside the chip box you have the chip manufacturer's signal names and pin/ball/land number aligned to the same pins as the signal lines they correspond to.  So, if by some esoteric example a board wired CPU_A15 to the PRG ROM's /CE, that would be immediately obvious at the mask ROM level of the schematic.<br /><br />You could even have a "footprint compatible" selection which would simply interchange the chip's internal details with those of another one to show what the differences were.<br /><br />Just thoughts.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3705">cpow</a> — Sun Nov 28, 2010 6:57 am</p><hr />

OK I fixed it. Yeah just doesn't use that solder pad to put the unused A14 to VCC. This means that particular pin didn't HAVE to be on VCC, at least not for this particular run of mask ROMs.<br />So the whole point of having different NROM-128 and NROM-256 boards makes no sense to me.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=38">Bregalad</a> — Sun Nov 28, 2010 4:06 am</p><hr />

I believe an EPROM has the same pinout as a ROM when not being used in program mode, so there's little need to even mention PGM, Vpp, etc.<br /><br />BTW, I like that you're interested in documenting all the board types and why they are that way, because it sheds light on the reasons they are designed that way, and highlights useful approaches to board design. So clarity beyond merely "this board is that way" is good. It makes it easier to remember, for one, since you understand the logic behind the design, rather than it being arbitrary seeming.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=17">blargg</a> — Sat Nov 27, 2010 11:35 am</p><hr />

That's confusing.<br /></div><br />Well, Blargg, I must say you raised a very good question ! You are right that we should definitely make some light on this before editing the page for a final (hopefully better) version.<br /><br />When I first made the page, by merging multiple diagrams I noticed some were using labels such as "A7" while others using longer labels such as "PRG A7". So I decided to keep the longer labels for EPROM diagrams, so that they indicate not only what the pin is used for, but where it is connected to.<br />When both are different, for example the /CE pin which is connected to GND, I use GND (/CE).<br /><br />The problem, is that for Mask ROMs that have pins connected to VCC or GND, you have no way to know if they are unused chip enable signals or not ! The only way would be to mod a board so that the pin is connected to a switch, and change the switch during gameplay. If the game freezes then chances are this was an extra chip enable pin.<br /><br />I have no idea why Nintendo did multiple boards for multiple PRG sizes.<br />For example, <em>Bugs Bunny's Carzy Castle</em>, which is 64 KB PRG and 32 KB CHR, uses NES-SBROM, while <em>Dr Mario</em> which is 32 KB PRG and 32 KB CHR, uses NES-SEROM.<br /><br />The only difference is that A15 becomes VPP, so in theory it would be absolutely no problem to put Dr Mario on a SBROM, A15 would just remain unused and connects to VPP but who cares as VPP is only used during programming. So I have no idea why they had to put it to VCC.<br /><br />This is even more obscure considering they could have wathever sized CHR-ROMs in the same slots. For example Testis is 32 KB PRG and only 16 KB CHR, but yet they use a SEROM board like Dr Mario which is 32 KB CHR. It doesn't cause them a problem that A14 (PGM) isn't connected to +5V.<br />However, you know that Nintendo did different boards for NROM-128 and NROM-256 games, which is in the same case : Why couldn't NROM-128 games work on NROM-256 boards with their unused PGM pin connected to A14 ?<br /><br />Fortunately this stopped at 128 KB and above ROMs, leading to less board per family.<br /><br /><br />The datasheet you found is interesting, it shows that unused inputs could be asked to be active low or high chip enables. That's what they used in Wizard &amp; Warriors 2 and some other AOROM boards to prevent bus confilcts.<br /><br />I'm not sure if there is a difference between /CE and /OE. On RAMs of course there is a difference (when writing to it you want /CE low but /OE high). For ROMs if there is a difference, it is in speed and power consumption, but not in functionality.

One thing I was thinking could be removed are the alternate pins for a particular chip, instead mentioning those in a note below. For example, the EPROM one could mention that A14 also doubles as PGM, and on smaller ones, A15 becomes +5V, and A13 no connection. I tried making a table, but I realized I don't know what the heck that page is describing. Is it telling the pin functions of the chips, or what those pins are wired to on the boards, or both? It states that "For some unknown reasons, unused address lines on smaller ROMs had to be put to +5V". Is this just because those address lines become extra chip select inputs? Also, the pinout suggests that for example pin 20 is a ground line on PRG ROM chips, but is it realls just /CS always selected, with 22 then being an /OE, as with an EPROM?<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=17">blargg</a> — Sat Nov 27, 2010 7:33 am</p><hr />

<div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"><br />Stop with the ad hominem comments. They are destructive to cooperation.<br /></div><br />You're right that I (and everyone) should focus on cooperation. I am just feeling that your argument that you need narrow diagrams was biased.<br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"><br />Where did I say I refuse to enlarge the window?<br /></div><br />Well here :<br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"><br />People who use a 1920x1080 monitor with the "snap" feature of Windows 7 or the "tile vertically" feature of previous Windows versions have a 960px window, which is just a tad narrower than the 1024px of a netbook or a 17" desktop monitor.<br /></div><br />and here :<br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"><br />When I used to have a small monitor, I'd have to do that since there wasn't much room for more than one window, but it was pure tedium, constantly switching between windows. With a larger display, I can put things side-by-side and not constantly switch windows. Web pages which demand a really wide browser window suck, and I don't want the wiki to suck like that. Almost always, information can be presented in a way that doesn't require a really wide page. By doing that, more styles of browsing can be accommodated.<br /></div><br /><br />You may not have used the word "refuse", but it was pretty much put that way, as if you couldn't easily enlarge/retract windows in a modern OS.<br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"><br />The toolbar would only be a problem if one wanted the browser window only a couple of inches wide, but that's pretty silly.<br /></div><br />Indeed.<br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"><br />The information shouldn't be made too compact. Duplication has costs, but so combination of information.<br /></div><br />Good point. So now the question is - is multiple-pinouts-in-one diagram such as Blarg's example too compact ?<br />I think they are ok personally, maybe not as intuitive as the old ones, I'm fine either way. Maybe we need to wait for more opinions before taking a definite decision.<br /><br />I'm however all against duplicating info on multiple pages, because it does just make things the most confusing IMO.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"><br />Yes, the comparison one is wider than a normal pinout, and one comparing say 6 pinouts would be even wider. If you have ideas for comparison pinouts that are even narrower, please share! <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /></div><br />Well I'm not the one who said things should be supposed to be narrow.<br />Also I don't think it could be narrower unless on a 1-dimensional list, which would obviously be worse to read.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"><br />I double-click the titlebar, but that only makes my window smaller.<br /></div><br />Interesting. It is linux who does that ? I use it at work and I don't remember it being different from Windows 7. Or maybe I should re-install Linux on my PC to compare what it does ? Anyway this is off topic.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=38">Bregalad</a> — Tue Nov 23, 2010 12:48 pm</p><hr />
