		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />NetPBM formats do have some stupid things such as using ASCII numbers even for binary formats, using gamma correction, and having to use varying depths. However, NetPBM also supports multiple pages, which is useful for &quot;dvipbm&quot; and &quot;foo2zjs&quot; (I wrote dvipbm myself, so that I could rasterize typeset documents to use on a host-based printer). This and other features may sometimes be good thing and make it suitable for some purposes, but in general I think farbfeld is just a simpler and better format for processing. My utilities do currently include conversion from Farbfeld to NetPBM (all six formats), although the other way around is not yet written (I will do so; I just didn't do it at first as reading NetPBM formats can be a bit complicated).<br /><br />Farbfeld and NetPBM each have their own advantages (even the features I listed above as &quot;stupid&quot; are sometimes an advantage, but usually they are stupid), but Farbfeld is better in general in my opinion, as it is far simpler (perhaps look at some of my codes you can see how much simpler it really is). I do agree that NetPBM would benefit to have a alpha format too though, perhaps P7 for text and P8 for binary. This could be told to whoever make NetPBM, and once they do then I will also add it into my program to convert Farbfeld to NetPBM and also the reverse way.<br /><br />Note also that I use Farbfeld only for processing and never actually save a file in Farbfeld format to disk, so in this way it is used only as a protocol (none of my programs require the input or output to be seekable, and note that you can use the <tt style="margin-left: 2px; margin-right: 2px; padding:3px; background-color: #3355aa; color: white;">&lt;&#40;&#41;</tt> feature of the shell for programs that require multiple inputs), although you can also use it for storage too.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Now it is possible to use &quot;ffbit&quot; program you can make output in NES/Famicom format. I don't know if it might be useful to anyone else but here it is. The &quot;ff-strip&quot; program might also be useful for dealing with tiles as it allows you to slice up the tiles into the correct order (bitff and ffbit require the tiles in a single vertical strip; ff-strip can reslice them into different orders).

I happen to like it but doesn't need to store on disk. I also like UNIX-style command-line program, making every program a filter, making each program to do one thing well, etc; it is good ideas!
