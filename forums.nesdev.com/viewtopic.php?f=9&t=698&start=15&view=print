		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />To have added support for the Famicom cartridge sound chips, all they would have had to impliment a simple switch.  If the NES slot was being used, the audio would go straight from the amplifying circuitry to the RCA jacks.  If the Famicom slot was being used, the audio would go straight from the amplifying circuity to the audio IN pin on the cartridge connector.  The switch would break the original connection to the RCA jacks during this instance so you would not hear double the 2A03 sound.  
<br />
<br />They could have used this switch to also "turn off" one of the slots.  Who knows what may happen if you have a Famicom and a NES cartridge inserted into the machine at the same time and push the power button?  It could possibly damage the system, so it would be best to enable only one at a time.  Alas, they were either too cheap or ignorant to do this.

<br />Sounds complicated.
<br />
<br />My method of modding a NES for Famisound mixes the audio out of the Famicart with the 2A03. And it works for every Famicart w/ sound I've tried. The levels are also about 99% correct.
<br />
<br />Look around on the board.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />The Famicom is simplier.  Once the audio signals are mixed, filtered and amplified, they go straight to the audio input on the Famicom connector.  If there no extra sound hardware in the cartridge, the cartridge bridges the audio input pin with the audio output pin, making a loop that goes straight to the RCA jack.  If there is extra sound hardware, the pins are not bridged on the cartridge and the NES sound travels through the cartridge before it appears on the RCA jack.  
<br />
<br />So for Famicom games, the parallel audio in and out lines are not bridged.  (The cartridge will do any bridging.)  For NES games, they are bridged on the PCB, not on the cartridge connector.  This is where the switch, really a jumper, comes in.

If you look, both the CPU and PPU pins on the cart connectors go to the NES on a chip.

<br />Also, on the board marked "wireless", I don't really see any RF circuitry, just 3 gloptops... prolly 4021's and some other kind of chip.  The RF stuff might be a solder-on module... I can't tell since there was no picture of the top side of that board.

<br />Feel free to share your thoughts on the NEX -- we can compare notes.
<br />
<br />Boy, I wish Messiah had hired some guys from the NesDev forum to design the NEX instead of relying on some presumably off-the-shelf famicrap.  The holy grail of a 100% compatible NES clone still hasn't been attained. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" alt=":(" title="Sad" />

<br />One thing I can't figure out though.  Why are all the fanboys just pissing their pants about this famiclone console?  I can't figure out what's different on it compared to a powerjoy that you can buy at your local mall, except for a few add-on frills.
<br />
<br />Heck, the one you can buy with a cart connector most likely would've played MMC5 games <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":-)" title="Smile" />

<br />
<br />The entire project screams "outsourcing".  The confused techno-Engrish, the poor construction, and the pathetic design.  Official interviews with the president of the company hint that he and a few others are the only permenant employees.  Paying people decent money for high-quality work is a thing of the past.  You can also be sure that the people that this was outsourced too only see a very minute fraction of the $60 paid for each NEX.  It is like slavery for the new millennium.  (I really need to stop.)

<br />
<br />Stick to the 60-pin cart connectors, because the Yobo 72-pin Neo-Fami does not play MMC5 games either.   
<br />
<br />The sucky thing about the console is that it looks appropriate, not unlike how Nintendo should have designed the console in the first place.  The NEX is a good looking clone, its just the hardware inside is cobbled-together crap not worth the two dollars it cost to make it off the assembly line.

<br />
<br />Trying to remember how the stereo mod worked on the NES, but I believe some of the 5 sound channels are diverted to the left side and some of the 5 are diverted to the right side.  I forget which of the 5 go to which side, but I believe the arrangement is such that  the sounds usually reserved for whichever side in most forms of music are diverted this way (like the drums, bass, melody are diverted to their respective sides...like when you hear giutar in one ear and vocals in the other or something).  I forget which of the 5 NES channels each side corresponds to.  Wish I could be more specific!  ANyway, I'm pretty sure this is the basic gist.
<br />
<br />Does anyone know which channels go to which sides?
<br />
