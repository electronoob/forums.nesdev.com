		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />problems with castlevania 2.  the title screen is ok, the start/password screen is jumpy virticaly but about 5 tiles (and several inbetween).  also, the background is wrong too ( i think that might be a mapper problem ?)
<br />
<br />after i hit start, the town is all jumpy, again about 5 tiles with a few inbetween.  walking right will stablize it.  the sprites are fine.
<br />
<br />i was watching the ppu address at the beginning of the render frame and it was eratic.  the lower 3 bits of the virtical tile were eratic, and the lower 2 of the fine virtical were eratic.
<br />
<br />i was messing with the vram address registers and the virtical increment durning rendering and didnt find the problem.  i tried changing some code around to break it (thinking i would get closer to the problem); that did mess up the graphics but the garbage graphics would jump up and down the same.
<br />
<br />at the moment i am at a loss.  any idea's
<br />
<br />thanks
<br />
<br />matt

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />i have some of the simple mappers working.  and i dont think its a mapper problem.  the pages the mapper switches are larger than what seems to be wrong.  i was watching the reads and writes to the ppu registers and i see it writing to 2006 twice and 2005.  same value all the time.  so the play field should be constant.  however, it writes to it on the first few scan lines while the ppu is rendering.  like scanline 0, 1, 3, 5.  i know the hardware nes doesnt show these lines, dont think its right since its still rendering and not the same line.  not sure whats up with that.  any idea's ?
<br />
<br />also, all (except mmc3 and apu) pass except vbl_clear_time.  can not get that to pass.  and pputime2 only shows a black screen.  i think a long time ago it showed a white square like it should.

<br />
<br />sorry, perhaps i didnt post that well, i meant it was writing on scanline 0, 1, 3, and 5 of rendering.  when i watched my debug of ppu register reads and writes, it would set the ppu address on right at the beginning of the pre render line.  then the next render frame it would set the ppu address on scanline 3 or 5 after the pre render line.
<br />
<br />i wasnt sure why it was setting the ppu address so late, and inconsistenly on different scan lines resulting in a different ppu address used since setting it late would mess up the counters on it.
<br />
<br />thanks
<br />

<br />here is a dump of the ppu register reads and writes for the last few render frames.  <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://zark.homelinux.org/~matt/nes/dump.castlevania2">http://zark.homelinux.org/~matt/nes/dump.castlevania2</a><!-- m -->  the line number is the line while rendering, meaningless in vblank.  cpu cc is the cpu cylce or tick * 15
<br />
<br />i noticed that it does the sprite dma twice.  does anyone have a dump of the reads and write to the ppu registers or familiar with castlevania 2 ?   does this game use nmi interrupts or polling for vblank?
<br />
<br />all of blarggs timing test pass except vbl_clear_time.nes and kevtris pputime2 does not work.
<br />
<br />i thought the cpu was good on timing.  not sure how else to test it.

<br />
<br />Virtually all commercial games use NMIs because $2002 polling is unreliable.
