		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Well, after years of thinking how nice it would be to have a program similar to MS's IDE but for NES (and quite possibly other consoles) development, I am finally putting something together. Perhaps one of the most important aspects of such a project would be coding an emulator 100% compatible with the editor (debugging purposes), but that is already done. The application is being coded entirely in C++, and wxWidgets is being used for GUI code. Some of the drawbacks I have come accross thus far are:
<br />
<br />- The lack of direct ways of accessing graphics and sound through wxWidgets. This is one of the reasons why I am using Allegro, but, as you can imagine, this is not that great of a solution. It is because of this that I have not yet implemented a decent pattern / VRAM memory viewer;
<br />
<br />- Extracting debug information out of CA65, which is what I am going to be using for now as an assembler (others could be easily supported though). Do any of you have any tips on how I should go about doing this in an efficient manner?
<br />
<br />- Usage of multiple threads. I am not aware of the capabilities of systems other than PCs, so I'd like to know if multi-threading could potentially compromise portability;
<br />
<br />- Lack of portable XML parsers. Maybe I am not searching correctly? What do you think of Gnome's parser? This is to be used for loading / saving project settings, and perhaps other things.
<br />
<br />What are some of the things you'd like to see in it? Here's some things I am planning on adding:
<br />
<br />- Some sort of a plugin for music composition;
<br />- Table generators (multiplication, etc.);
<br />
<br />Ideas are welcome.

<br />- A text-like window within the instructions (like a disassembler output);
<br />- An option to choose an opcode, then its addressing mode + insert button/value (if required);
<br />- Options to define the 3 vectors (RESET/NMI/IRQ);
<br />- A 'load GFX buffer' &amp; set loading point (cpu address, as 'lda $C000');
<br />- Labels &amp; shortcuts (like '#define _SOUNDADDR  $F8') user-define;
<br />- Stupid iNES header creator and/or UNIF packaging;
<br />- A preview, obviously, to run your code (basic 'run', 'trace', 'step back');
<br />- Any additional feature to enhance the UI.
<br />
<br />Lazyness is a crucial problem <img src="./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" />
<br />I have this UI in mind... but the programming motivation... ^_^;;;

<br />linux has threads can't say about mac but i think so
<br />but unless you can test these systems, you can't garentee portability even using wxwidgets (take look at the 'done' list on each of the systems) and there's allegro portabilty compatibilty too to be considered

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Yeah, it seems like I am going to have problems in terms of portability. Right now, however, it does not really matter that much whether I can get the program to run on other architectures or not. So far I have been adding new features to my emulator and have begun working on an interface for CA65. 
<br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">feed the exe's output through the pipe information to a list box</div>
<br />I'm afraid it is more complicated than that. What I actually need is information regarding line numbers and whatnot, so that breakpoints can be established easily. It seems like the authors of CA65 have not bothered to document the object file format, so I really do not know what to do. I guess I could somehow parse automatically generated listings and figure out the line numbers from that. 
<br />
<br />By the way, a new version of aNESe is out, which sort of shows what the IDE is going to look like. You can get it from my website.
<br />
<br />Any other suggestions are welcome.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />One simple solution is to build rom memory marking into an existing emulator such as FCEU and then to 
<br />
<br />run the rom
<br />set a starting point for rom memory marking
<br />play the rom
<br />stop the rom memory marking
<br />dump the LIST of marked ares of the rom to a file
<br />
<br />This list of marked areas contains all of the 
<br />   a. data memory read from 
<br />   b. data memory written to
<br />   c. instructions executed
<br />
<br />This way you could first:
<br />  1. mark all code + data that is used in the startup screen
<br />
<br />  2. mark all code + data used in playing a particular part of the game.

<br />Didn't Family BASIC have a keyboard? Or is that device too rare to be useful?

<br />Looks like an adapter to hook a keyboard to Squeedo's expansion port would be pretty simple, just needs a couple pull-up resistors.  An NES controller port is only one input and one output, I'm not sure if that's enough by itself.
<br />
<br />It's also pretty easy to just use RS232 and type in a terminal program.  But that way you get the text in ASCII and control codes.
