Having some issues with Metroid FDS v 1.02. Some doors won't spawn, high jump boots didn't show up and the zebetites and mother brain were already dead when I entered the room. I have used the same rom and powerpak before with zero problems. Rev E powerpak on a sound modded NES. I think that saving progress and continuing is causing the problem since the first time I beat it I didn't save until I finished the game.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=4219">nothingnew</a> — Tue May 27, 2014 10:01 pm</p><hr />

Older versions of the PowerPak MMC3 would corrupt bytes when the scanline IRQ was turned on or off. The writes to $E000-$FFFF were momentarily decoded to $6000-$7FFF because PRG /CE changes slightly later than A13-A14. This was noticeable as map corruption in M.C.

The exact reason for the problem is that Kirby checks the WRAM throughly:<br /><br />If it's smaller than 8KB<br /><br />If it can be write protected or not (Kirby is supposed to run on a TKROM board and that one has both CE and /CE pins connected to MMC3)<br /><br />And a few other sanity checks.<br /><br />If anything fails, the game runs but background changes oddly, stage layout is corrupted and you can spot "HAL" written on the background of the1st stage at the furthest part you can get to. Also, if you try to do the "inhale" move Kirby get stuck doing that.<br /><br />Why I know this ? When I was testing my MMC3 dev board I played around with the WRAM hookup and it only works properly when WRAM is hooked "right".<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=4943">l_oliveira</a> — Thu Feb 09, 2012 9:46 am</p><hr />
