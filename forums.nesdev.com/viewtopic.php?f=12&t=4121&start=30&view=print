<br />The owner of a lawfully made copy of a work, such as the CIC containing the Super NES key program, is allowed to do anything he wants with that particular copy short of reproduction. This includes prying it out of a cartridge, soldering it into another, and selling that cartridge, so long as it doesn't infringe the exclusive rights described in <a href="http://www.copyright.gov/title17/92chap1.html" class="postlink">chapter 1 of the U.S. copyright statute</a> (or foreign counterpart). Even reproduction can be made to not infringe copyright in a work with negligible expressive value, such as the header of a Game Boy or Sega Genesis cart (<em>Sega v. Accolade</em>) or the authentication in a printer cartridge's microcontroller (<em>Lexmark v. Static Control</em>). Here, the benefits of competition outweigh copyright, and the use is deemed fair.

<br />What would be nice is a reprogrammable base cart that acts like a patch allowing you to play a modified version of the game through an unmodified cart. Like one of the pass-through pirate carts or how Sonic &amp; Knuckles works.

<br />
<br />And you could make it programmable -- stick a bunch of patches on there.  Have the cart send back a dummy reset vector, while you figure out what game cart it is ... and then have it switch to the real game. The cart itself would just work like a Game Genie with ~1,000,000 active codes. Though I bet it would be really hard to get it fast enough.
<br />
<br />So in the end, it'd look like one of those old-school "Japanese to English converters", only it really <em>would</em> translate inserted Japanese games to English. If the SNES weren't so old, I bet that'd impress the hell out of your friends, heh. May as well make it a flash cart for homebrew, too. Just require the extra game for the CIC signal.
<br />
<br />Just don't put any patches on it yourself before distributing unless you want to / don't mind pissing off the ROM hacking scene.
<br />
<br />Oh, and Star Ocean + FEoEZ would still likely be out of the question, as they have real-time streaming decompression. Not really feasible to patch that data. And their MMCs would present the same challenges as the NES Game Genie had. Check bytes may not be 100% compatible when we're talking 1MB patches, rather than 3-byte changes. It would probably need logic to capture MMC writes as well.

<br />
<br />Hi there,
<br />
<br />It is, SFII Alpha is a single MROM game of 32Mb, I believe it should be possible to use 2 paralleled EPROMS on this PCB, it works on other boards as well, knowing that people use 4 801's parallel for a SoMII cart. 
<br />
<br />I'm also searching for a 64Mb Flash, a 29F064 or similar, to use for games like Star Ocean or Tales of Phantasia, anybody have any experience on this?

There is a method to put the 96mbit Star Ocean hack that removes SDD1 functions on a regular type of cartridge but I don't know where the plans for it are. But that's a better option and you'll need 3 32mbit chips for it.
