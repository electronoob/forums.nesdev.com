		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Hi everyone,<br /><br />New here.  I'm embarking on a side project to create an original homebrew NES game and self-publish a small run of physical cartridges.  I have a lot of background in game design and assembly programming, and love working directly with hardware.  I've developed things for GBA (example games for Catapult), Commodore 64 (random practice 6502 programs) and even Gamecube (GC-Forth).<br /><br />I'll be using C (CC65) with a smattering of assembly and Shiru's wonderful framework and tools as a starting point.<br /><br />I'm collaborating with a friend/coworker who will be taking care of the hardware side and some of the software side.  Most of my role will be creative and coding/scripting.  He's going to be creating a pair of homemade &quot;dev kits&quot; interfacing the computer via an Arduino functioning as an eeprom programmer  through a cable going directly into a NES cart (with EEPROM chips inside).  The self-publishing phase is up in the air but the plan is as soon as the game is impressive enough to demo (or finished!) we'll do a Kickstarter to raise the funds needed for manufacturing.<br /><br />To start we will be doing a 32k NROM cart, with hopefully a WRAM expansion.<br /><br />Looking forward to interacting with the community to trade knowledge, post major milestone screenshots and so on.  Nothing specific to say or post yet!  I am just mastering the hardware and figuring out my TODO list of needed subroutines and seed gameplay mechanic ideas.  Getting a feel for the constraints of the hardware and what might be possible is a task unto itself.  Almost like a process of ... &quot;Research and Development&quot;. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />P.S. Mike (my partner in this) is also looking into doing his own separate game, crowdsourcing for ideas - I'm more of a subscriber to the auteur paradigm <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />   He'll probably pop up here eventually... we've both been joining nes homebrew forums <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />

I would be interested to see what their response is, given that the console hasn't been on-market since the early-to-mid 90s, and that the case with Tengen never resulted in any kind of &quot;official&quot; statement (and the main focus there had to do with the CIC bypass).<br /><br />Ask 'em.  Seriously.  See what they have to say.

Kinda surprised if so.

The patents have expired on the NES hardware, it's the trademarks/copywrights on the titles/characters that they hold on to for a long time, or potentially forever in the case of Disney and Mickey Mouse.

For example, games are a complement to the console they run on. As I understand it, the following wording that I used on the <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/viewtopic.php?p=109813#p109813" class="postlink">label of the Streemerz bundle</a> should be fine:<br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">For play on Nintendo Entertainment<br />System.
