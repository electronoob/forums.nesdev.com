There are a few people who have probably gained 100 posts to their post totals by posting information irrelevant to the topic about how much they want jargon to be banned. I didn't take his gibberish posting too personally, and I didn't really get passionately angry about it. Honestly, it seems like some people were enjoying being angry with him. I think if you want someone to stop posting garbage, stop responding to it. Posting things like "Your f***ing retarded" really doesn't help.

<br />
<br />His presence diverts from education and communion.
<br />
<br />What has helped and will help is the LACK of his presence.
<br />
<br />Let's let a few weeks pass and maybe you'll come to the same realization.  No comments here needed at that time and no "I told you sos" will be said.

And I do see reason for him to be banned, I just think he was made into a subject that needlessly took over the discussion in a couple of threads. Don't misunderstand me, I don't want him to continue to post garbage.
<br />
<br />Oh and also, by posting this, I realize that I, too, am guilty of contributing to thread hijacking. Perhaps most of this thread relating to the banning of jargon should be moved to the "Is this board better off without..." thread.

I ignored the other annoying guy all the way along and I didn't see any problem with that. If someone is posting crap and that nobody on the board ever notice him or say anything about his crap then he will eventually leave.
<br />
<br />But yeah the other guy's post were pure non-sense, but since I'm not an english speaker it's quite usual to find things that I can't make sense of, so I just ignore it.
