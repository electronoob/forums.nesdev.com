		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Last night I decided to play Metroid on the Powerpak. Since I have yet to find a FDS rom that works I was playing the NES version. I didn't get too far in to the game when the game reset. I wasn't too annoyed because I hadn't gone far. So, I started over. It reset again only much sooner. Then it reset several times after only a couple of steps. Finally it reset and when it came back up the levels were all garbled, I had several weapons and items, and Samus was wearing her Justin Bailey suit. After I walked over to the left a bit in the garbled world and picked up an item that looked like the morphing ball it reset again and played normally, or so I thought. After collecting 2 missle containers I went for the bombs. Only it wouldn't remember that I had collected the bombs. I could leave the room and come back and the bomb icon was still sitting on it's pedestal.  Every time I could collect it again, but I could not leave bombs and it was back again if I left the room and came back. I just thought that was odd. I hope my Powerpak isn't going bad.

This will run them in the same temperature and edge connector environment so that if it's the hardware, it will occur again. You might also verify the programs you're running on the PowerPak, in case the copies on your card are corrupt.
