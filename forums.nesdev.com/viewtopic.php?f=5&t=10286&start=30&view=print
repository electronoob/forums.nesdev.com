		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I'm a software engineer at Videon Central, Inc. working on embedded C/C++ middleware for blu ray players, both commercial and for in-flight entertainment. If you have a Samsung or LG blu ray player, you probably have Videon's software running in your living room! In addition to that Videon is breaking into the streaming media market with the android app: aVia Media Player. That's the main project I've been working on; all Java lately, and some SQL.<br /><br />I agree with a lot that has been said about the games industry. I don't want to work in it because then I could not do what I really want to do, and would not have the freedom to take my time at it and make something high quality.

Basically means dissecting lots of Android applications to find out how our driver software and GPU hardware handles them.

I wish I'd have something like that.<br /><br />Currently I basically spends days doing almost nothing because I can do in 3h what they ask me to do in 2 days, and I am excessively overqualified for what I'm doing (that is, when I am doing something). This is so annoying. I'm looking forward for next month when I'll go back to campus and I will have weeks of 70 hours of work again. Will be a change that weeks of 7 hours of work + 33 hours of &quot;worthless presence at work&quot;.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />My point is that most of the time people don't even know what you're doing. If you have a programming job, nobody cares what type of gibberish is written in your text editor. Unless you work side by side with other (nosy) programmers that keep looking at your screen and asking you questions, but even then you can squeeze some 6502 every once in a while.<br /><br />The key is to only code parts of the game (routines, for example), and not test them while at work (if you open an emulator you will certainly draw attention to you!). Leave the testing and debugging for when you get home. Another good thing you can do at work is write design documents, outline the program structure... normal people will actually think you're working if they happen to look at you.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Most of the time isn't really good enough in that situation. All it takes is one time the wrong person knowing what you're up to, and you could have a big problem on your hands. It's a pretty significant risk.<br /><br />And, hey, maybe it's a risk worth taking. It depends on the situation-- tepples was just coming at it speculatively, I think, but the kind of stipulations you get in a lot of work contracts very often take explicit ownership of stuff like this, and depending on the company it could be a huge risk to try and do stuff like this on the clock. (Under a lot of contracts, it's a risk to do this kind of stuff at home too. Last time I was looking for a job, I turned down an otherwise decent offer because they wanted ownership of my creative output at home as well as at work. It may sound weird, but I know a ton of people that have accepted contracts like this.)
