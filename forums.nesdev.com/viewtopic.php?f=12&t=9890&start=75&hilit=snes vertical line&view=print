		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />It's not overall current draw, but sudden spikes in current. One hypothesis is that the traces to the regulator aren't low enough resistance, so the voltage drops ever so slightly that far. Thicker wires and bypass caps have been tried. Another is that the regulator isn't able to respond quickly enough to avoid a slight drop, hence adding a second regulator. Maybe inductance is an issue? It'll be nice when it's clear exactly what the issue is and a minimal fix is found, so this bumping around in a dark room can come to an end.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Could someone with a quality benchtop adjustable power supply and a <span class="posthilit">SNES</span>/TV combo that shows this problem try something simple?<br /><br />1) Set the benchtop power supply to 5.00V DC and current limit to 1 Amp. be 100% sure it's at this voltage. Nothing more.<br />2) Just don't use the 7805 regulator, and connect the positive lead after or at the output of the regulator. Connect the negative lead to where it makes sense. Plan ahead so you don't get the polarity backwards and instantly destroy everything.<br />3) Then just play through a game as normal to somewhere where the <span class="posthilit">vertical</span> bars are obvious.<br />4) Now start to undervolt the system. 4.9V, 4.8V, 4.75V... 4.7... 4.65... 4.6... 4.5...<br />5) as you decrease the voltage down to about 4.5V, what happens to the display and the prominence of the bars?<br />6) obviously there's going to be a too low of voltage to where the system stops operating properly and resets or glitches... that's too far. maybe you can't even get down to 4.5V, maybe you can get down to 4V. Don't know until you try.<br /><br />If ground bounce is the problem, then the bars will become less noticeable as the supply voltage decreases.<br /><br />I just hope the PPU isn't so finicky that it quits outputting a usable picture with even a slight voltage decrease.<br /><br />Also, please, please don't go much more over 5.3V... it's so tempting with these adjustable supplies, but the chips weren't designed for that.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I like your approach of a well-defined test to find out what happens. Along these lines, as I read yours I imagined &quot;injecting&quot; the 5V right at the PPU rather than at the usual place by the (disconnected) regulator. And injecting it by the DRAM. Not hard to try if one is taking the time to try the above.

It looks like 52/63?  I'd probe with a multimeter but I've actually blown a fuse doing this one because my probes on my multimeter are two large and I've shorted pins very close to each other.<br /><br />Anyone have an idea?  Thanks.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />First, verify that your meter works and that you can tell continuity from say a 100 ohm resistor. Then, put one lead on the regulator's +5V out, and the other around the board. It's often fairly easy to find the positive rail by the large areas of copper, <a href="http://i.imgur.com/esCuu46l.jpg" class="postlink">like I did on my <span class="posthilit">SNES</span> board</a>. It's best if you have a meter that beeps when there's continuity, so you can keep your eyes on the board. I hated my old meter that only had resistance, all that eye back-and-forth movement.<br /><br />And wow, I just realized that I can examine this in detail now that I have a scope!

I discovered that on the doom superfx pcb you can completely isolate the gsu 2 power by cuttine just one trace.  Sometimes you get lucky with good pcb design like that.

At least that's the theory.
