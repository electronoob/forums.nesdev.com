<br />
<br />Looking at the rom file in hex editor and comparing the pattern table values displayed in FCEUX's Hex Editor, it seems that the graphics reside at prgrom bank 6(at 0x18010 in the rom file). Ok, that's great for Metroid, but I don't know what the general method is for extracting the graphics and loading them into the pattern table for any rom with no chrom.
<br />
<br />I think it's just my ignorance in exactly what happens when the nes boots. I was under the impression that when the NES boots, it automatically loads the ppu's pattern tables with the chrom(worked for me so far...). But if there is no chrom present...then what? I've yet to see in the mm1 mapper docs, how the pattern tables are loaded, so I'm pretty confused here.
<br />
<br />Where can I find info that describes exactly the structure of a rom file with a mapper? Or is it game specific? I doubt it though. But I also doubt that all mm1 roms put their chrram at bank 6(I haven't studied other ones yet, though)

<br />
<br />You're lucky if they just popped out at you by looking at bank 6.  Some games, even LOZ, store their CHR data at unfriendly offsets so the tiles don't just pop out when viewed as a CHR viewer expects the data to be drawn.  Games that don't have CHR-ROM store their graphics in the only other available place...PRG-ROM.  The initialization of said games includes a loop where the relevant (usually title-screen first) portions of the CHR data are copied from the PRG-ROM location to CHR-RAM.  
<br />
<br />Some games, I'm sure, compress the CHR data stored in PRG-ROM so you'd never be able to see it by direct observation.
<br />
<br />ROM files with mappers are no different than ROM files without...they're just larger.  Since the NES CPU can only "see" 32KB of PRG-ROM at a time, some of the PRG-ROM data in the file is going to have to be loaded by your emulator into memory so that it can be "made visible" to the NES CPU when the NES CPU instructs the game's mapper circuitry to bankswitch.

<br />
<br />The NES doesn't load anything on its own. Many different PPU accesses go out to the cart while rendering a frame. When the PPU reads pattern tables, it is just reading whatever it is given from whichever chip on the cart happens to respond to the read (or write for that matter). There is no memory for pattern tables in the NES console. 
<br />
<br />When a game uses a RAM chip for graphics, it will have to write to the pattern tables to fill it with data. 
<br />
<br />I hope what I have written helps (and is at least accurate on a basic level).
<br />
<br />EDIT: I should probably mention that this applies as well to PRG-ROM. One of the most common mistakes is to use memcpy or a loop to copy data from the ROM to "PRG-ROM" arrays when you should just keep track of pointers for each bank (the smallest banks used in commercial game mappers is 4KB/1KB PRG/CHR, IIRC).

<br />Actually I think it's 8K (maybe there are some pirate mappers that use 4K, IDK). In any case, using 4K might be a good idea if you want to support NSF at some point.

<br />
<br />To load the tile data the game has a table of "tile groups" that specify the ROM bank and address of the CHR data, the address it should be copied to in VRAM, and the number of bytes that make up the group of tiles. This is part of that table, from SnowBro's Metroid disassembly:
<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">; Format:&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Source Bank<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Source Address, dest address &#40;VRAM&#41;, size in bytes<br />GFXInfo:<br />LC6E0:&nbsp; &nbsp;.byte $06&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;;&#91;SPR&#93;Samus, items.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Entry 0.<br />LC6E1:&nbsp; &nbsp;.word $8000, $0000, $09A0<br />LC6E7:&nbsp; &nbsp;.byte $04&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;;&#91;SPR&#93;Samus in ending.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Entry 1.<br />LC6E8:&nbsp; &nbsp;.word $8D60, $0000, $0520<br />LC6EE:&nbsp; &nbsp;.byte $01&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;;&#91;BGR&#93;Partial font, &quot;The End&quot;.&nbsp; &nbsp;Entry 2.<br />LC6EF:&nbsp; &nbsp;.word $8D60, $1000, $0400<br />LC6F5:&nbsp; &nbsp;.byte $06&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;;&#91;BGR&#93;Brinstar rooms.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Entry 3.<br /></div>
<br />Each level (as well as the title screen/ending sequence) specifies a list of tile groups, by index, that are used. The game just looks up the location of the tile data and copies it to the PPU.

I always thought that the memory in the cart was completely copied into the nes's memory and if the program needed to switch it would grab the code from the cart, so that's what I did with my emulator(this time, grabbing code from the rom file). Seems like that's not gonna work now <img src="./images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" alt=":(" title="Sad" />. Hmmm, I'll have to redesign my memory then.
<br />
<br />But now that I think of it, if that was true then I guess you could just pull the cart from the nes at anytime and not screw anything up(at least games with no mappers). Perhaps I was thinking along the lines of cd-based game where the game doesn't immediately screw up cause you took the CD out cause everything that the game currently needs is in ram.

<br />Some systems allow for a completely RAM-based program. There have to be 1. no continuous communication between the CIC, 2. enough video memory to make a picture, and 3. interrupt vectors pointed at RAM or the system's BIOS. Systems meeting this are disc-based consoles as well as the Game Boy Advance and Nintendo DS. You can even load up one town on Animal Crossing in your GameCube, take the disc out, put it in your Wii, and load up another town.

<br />Well, the Famicom Disk System uses floppies for the games, and I'm pretty sure that the programs/graphics are copied from the floppy to RAM. You still can't unplug the thing though, because it has a mapper and the RAM that holds the program and graphics.
