Emulators come with tons of features which of course are very nice, still there's something I miss.<br />Perhaps I'm getting too nostalgic, but I miss the experience itself by playing the NES in front of my old tv when I was a kid. I know atleast some people know what I am talking about since some emulators have built-in filters to &quot;emulate&quot; old tv's to make the experience more authentic.<br />My question is, do you think the experience/feeling can be improved even more, without actually sitting in front of an old TV playing the real thing?<br />I am not sure what I am talking about, I just want to improve the experience! <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />I've been playing with the idea of another NES-fileformat, which mainfocus isn't about adding missing bits from the iNES-header, but instead focus on the &quot;NES experience&quot;. Perhaps being able to add boxart-scans, into the file itself. In theory you could probably code some pretty nice-looking &quot;Select a ROM&quot;-file requesters with graphical interface instead of filenames.<br /><br />What do you guys think in general? Are there more ways of improving the &quot;feeling&quot; on todays emulators, that is not really related to emulation of the games itself?

For many old games the manuals are absolutely required, so it's no wonder some people think old games are overly hard because they expect they can just pick it up and play like modern games.<br /><br />However, some people (like developers) will probably consider that type of stuff to be useless cruft.

Maybe an option to progressively deteriorate manuals, carts and boxes as you use them would be interesting. The possibility of writing on them would be cool too. This way you could have your own virtual game collection, where commonly used items look worse.

Don't make a useless ROM format when you can solve the issue so simply like this. For games that don't have the artwork you can just use a placeholder with the filename on it. But it'll never be quite the same as the real thing.

It really adds to the experience. Same goes with any system that uses disks, not only NES.
