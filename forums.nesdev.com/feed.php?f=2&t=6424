I know the principle of this is old info, just wanted to see how this specific game ticks.<br /><br />In the title screen it reads $2004 8 times on scanlines 16..23 around scanline clock ~310:<br /><br />FD6E     BIT $2004<br />FD71     BMI $FD73<br />FD73     ...<br /><br />So it adds an extra cycle whenever the value returned by $2004 has the top bit set.

That way they get a more precise CPU-PPU sync.<br /><br />So yeah, no reason for this game to fail on Famicom.<br /><br />...<br /><br />On the same note, has anybody tested if the palette readback through $2007 works on Famicom?<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=80">thefox</a> — Sun Sep 19, 2010 6:43 pm</p><hr />

Bregalad, I think his point was that since the synchronization affects that, it could therefore affect <em>anything</em>. I don't think that's a useful premise. I'm satisfied with JSR's $2004 read test in all sorts of situations, <em>always</em> returning PPU open bus on his Famicom.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=17">blargg</a> — Tue Jun 08, 2010 3:00 pm</p><hr />

On blargg's NES, the clock alignment apparently DOES determine the read behaviour, which on the other hand is dependant on the power-up state. So on the Famicom, it may very well be related to the fact that the PPU is in a different power-up state than the NES. It may of course also be true that  this is because of a different PPU revision (though not being able to read something flaky sounds more like FIXING a glitch).<br /><br />One practical way to find out is to run the test on a NES where the /RES pin of the PPU is tied to VCC in a similar fashion as the Famicom.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3760">6502freak</a> — Tue Jun 08, 2010 4:19 am</p><hr />
