<br />
<br />According to the wiki:
<br />
<br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">The NTSC video signal is made up of 262 scanlines, and 20 of those are spent in vblank state. After the program has received an NMI, it has about 2270 cycles to update the palette, sprites, and nametables as necessary before rendering begins.</div>
<br />
<br />Right now, my nametable updating routine (used for vertical parallax) updates a region of 4 x 8 tiles and takes around 258 cycles. I'd like to increase the size of the update region, but doing so will obviously increase the cycle count as well.
<br />
<br />Assuming I perform sprite DMA and overwrite the palette with a 32-byte zero page buffer each frame, approximately how many cycles can I safely budget for nametable updates?

<br />
<br />By the way, what's the best way to <em>guarantee</em> that your VRAM updates haven't exceeded the vblank interval? Can you simply check bit 7 of PPUSTATUS and call it good if it's still set to 1?

<br />What does it involve, exactly? Waiting until the sprite 0 hit flag gets set back to 0?

<br />Yes if you use Nesticle  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=":wink:" title="Wink" /> 
<br />
<br />The proper way would be to check your timing under Nintendulator. Also, the sprite zero hit is always reset at the end of VBlank, but if I'm not mistaking it's reset after the last possible $2007 write, and it's not very usefull as you have to guarantee a hit has occured previous frame (else the flag would be '0' for the whole frame, including the VBlank).

<br />
<br />IMO, this is something you worry about when designing the game, at which point you make sure combinations of VRAM updates that exceed the VBlank time will never be executed. What good is it knowing, at runtime, that you blew it and went over the time limit? No matter what you do from that point on the display is already corrupt! So there is no real point in detecting the end of VBlank, other than for timing reasons.

<br />Sorry, when I said "design" I meant "development". So yeah, you could even have the program itself detect this error, but it might be difficult to know exactly what combination of VRAM updates caused the problem without analyzing it further with a debugger at the exact moment it happens.

This would give you 16 extra scanlines, and 1800+ cycles. Though this would be kind of difficult to pull off if you didn't have fixed-length routines during the blanking period or a scanline counter. You might be able to get away with having all fixed-length routines in your Vblank code if you need the extra 8 on top. By that, I mean having fixed-length routines doesn't sound unreasonable.
<br />
<br />But having 8 blanked on the bottom sounds like a better plan if you don't need so much more time.

<br />This was probably great for Battletoads, because not only this is easier to code, but also because the game relied on good timing for it's status bar at the top of the screen (right after VRAM updates) and all. However, the time taken to perform unnecessary VRAM updates could be the difference between fluid animation and lost frames, in cases where there is a lot of action going all at once, so, performance-wise, this isn't optimal at all.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I think it would be wise to at least look at what Battletoads does. That game is really the king of blanking. Maybe don't do exactly what it does, but get ideas from it.
<br />
<br />I actually suggest if you're going to extend Vblank, do it from the top. Though if you don't have a scanline counter, you'll have to figure out some way to know when the blanking is supposed to stop so you can appropriately set the Y scroll.
<br />
<br />Also, I kind of think that the fixed-length PPU updating code always running is kind of a good idea. This eliminates the need for scanline counting. If you're in the NMI, running fixed code from the beggining of the frame, you'll be able to reset the scroll appropriately depending on how far it spills out of Vblank.
<br />
<br />I think most of the time with Battletoads, it isn't doing useless PPU updates. I'm pretty sure the player is made of 16 fixed tiles, and those tiles are updated with CHR RAM instead of the player being assigned to different tiles.

It's likely that some of the corner cases didn't get exploited because Nintendo said they are subject to change in a future NES revision. Remember how some games for the original PlayStation glitch on a PS2, even more PS1 games don't work on a slim PS2, and some PS2 games don't work even on the (discontinued) PS3 with backward compatibility.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">I think Battletoads reserved some of the stack just for nametable updates, so it could use a series of Pops and Stores to populate the nametables.</div><br />Which is still 1 cycle slower than loading the values from ZP, so it really isn't the optimal choice.</div>
<br />Heck, copying from $0100 using PLA isn't much faster than copying from $0100 using a plain old unrolled loop. It just saves ROM bytes and opens up the X register.
