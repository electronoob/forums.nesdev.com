There is one thing I realized about the Circuit Specialists desoldering station I'm using, the tips wear out a lot faster than I'd prefer.  If that's the one you're asking about, yeah it uses an electric air pump.  I don't know what the temperature is, it's a 1-to-9 dial and I just set to 7 or 8.  I want it hot so it can melt fast and I can move on to the next one.  Maybe these cheaper-made tips don't like the higher temps, I dunno.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=10">Memblers</a> — Sat May 08, 2010 10:26 pm</p><hr />

I recently bought a desoldering iron similar to this one:<br /><br /><img src="http://www.mpja.com/images/16922.jpg" alt="Image" /><br />It has a built in solder sucker. So far I've found it slightly more efficient than the RadioShack one (which is also very good, but mine isn't working very well anymore). Holding it in way that you can push the button is a little awkward, but so is pressing and releasing the rubber ball on the other one.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=95">tokumaru</a> — Sat May 08, 2010 8:45 pm</p><hr />

I will soon be installing a copynes and i was reviewing this post.<br />I would like as much advice as possible.  I have an open wallet for supplies and such.<br /><br />Im pretty worried about the procedure since i have little to no desoldering experience.  I do however grasp skills quickly.  My first soldering job was soldering a modchip into my xbox. <br /><br />I have been praticing with circuit boards i have laying around the house in desoldering similar sized ICs <br /><br />I tried using a 15 watt radioshack pencil and it was worthless  Just would not melt the solder even if i held it there for 20 seconds.  i changed to a brand new 30 watt radioshack and it was slightly less worthless.  i hold it on the pin and it would take 10 seconds to melt the solder.  The tip was laughably solder repellant and couldent be tinned with either my 60-40 solder or with my low melting silver bearing solder.  also even no fresh solder did not melt on immediate contact.  They both seemed to have poor heat conductance.  <br /><br />I changed to a 23 watt weller thats been rather mistreated.<br />I cleaned the tip  and re tinned it.<br /><br />worked much better  using a spring vaccume pump it sucked much of the solder of the pin however the pins still stick to the board.  i used a prod tool underneath the ic and slowly tilted it cracking the small bits of solder.  i wasent being rough.<br /><br />i played with it and eventually sucessfully got the IC off the board<br /><br />it wasnt a bad task however it was just a single sided board   relitively easy<br /><br />Now i was considering getting something a little more professional <br /><br />would you recomend a radioshack desoldering iron?<br />The heated one with the rubber ball on the end? <br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.radioshack.com/product/index.jsp?productId=2062731">http://www.radioshack.com/product/index ...

If you don't want to buy a desoldering iron, simply get a solder wick (copper braid), drip plenty of fresh solder on all of the ICs contact points, and between them, then aply the braid, heat it, and lift the solder from an entire row of pins at one time.  <br /><br />It's much faster and cleaner than the desoldering irons, and you won't burn the logic board. <br /><br />What are the part numbers on the components in your Famicom clone?<br /><br />-Xious<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=4070">Xious</a> — Thu Apr 29, 2010 11:41 am</p><hr />

Realistically you should be able to ship it via lettermail, making it probably cost around $2 at most. I consider $7-10 a much more reasonable price. <br /><br /><br />I'm also still looking for the NES PPU if anyone knows where I could possibly find that.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=4236">SatoshiMatrix</a> — Tue Apr 27, 2010 12:34 pm</p><hr />

The parts on this VS board are dated 1984 and 1983, it's pretty old.  One of the original AA batteries on had tested at 1.56V !

yeah I was pretty use to doing modchips but the first nes card I modded did not go very smoothly for me , ultimately I did not burn the board but it appeared black at first, I cleaned it with isopropyl and everything was clean and shiny, my biggest mistake was the way I wired it up, I should have cut traces and used a little wire but instead I used a lot of wire, it worked for a good wile eventually after a few trys but I had to fix it after  a few years. My later attempts went much better.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=188">peppers</a> — Fri Apr 16, 2010 8:09 pm</p><hr />

It was a UNROM cart I wanted to modify, the problem was that the ROM pins' solder joints were almost flat, it's the bare minimum of solder in there.  So there was really poor heat transfer, the braid could only suck part it up because the solder wasn't hot enough to flow on both sides of the board (thus compounding the problem).  But yeah I'm sure it would work good if used right, me personally messing around with stuff on my own I used up the whole roll by the time I knew how to use the stuff properly, heheh.

For desoldering I just use a really cheap solder sucker. You have to push down this pump thing so it clicks in, then you just push this button on the side so it releases the pump and it causes a split second of suction. So yeah, you have the iron coming in contact with the solder so it's hot/melted, then you really quick put the solder sucker over the melted solder and push the button. It works surprisingly well for looking like such a piece of crap. I think it was like $7.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=138">Celius</a> — Fri Apr 16, 2010 12:20 pm</p><hr />

one problem with having the component side facing down is that some components that you don't want to desolder might drop down from the pcb them self. i think it's better to put it upright (or with a little angle so the component side is pointing slightly upwards), this way you both have a good look where you are heating and it's easy to pull out the components when the solder have reached the melting point and you don't need to fight gravity <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3903">hyarion</a> — Thu Apr 15, 2010 7:42 pm</p><hr />
