I can understand the SNES part pulling a port down (video bandwidth) but there are definitely plenty of things that are the actual SuperFX's problem. Not having texture mapped floors is definitely not the SNES's problem, and I would have thought that a 20Mhz processor would be able to handle a seemingly perfect port of Doom, but apparently not. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_confused.gif" alt=":?" title="Confused" /> What kind of specs would your computer need to run Doom back in the day, because they must have had to be pretty good...

The GBA can run a seemingly perfect port of Doom 2, (censorship doesn't affect processor speed <img src="./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=":wink:" title="Wink" /> ) and it definitely doesn't have anything like 4 MB of ram. I guess the GBA's small resolution helps cuts back on CPU power. (Which I know isn't directly related to ram, but still.) Do you know what resolution Doom was running in in the video? I know the GBA technically has a 32 bit processor, but from what I've heard, it takes quite a performance hit when accessing rom when in 32 bit mode, (If I remember correctly) so it's better to just use Thumb which is 16 bit. Of course, CPU speed isn't everything as some processors are more efficient than others<span style="font-size: 4%; line-height: normal">I'm looking at you, Stef.</span>

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Random comment in passing for @Espozo: if you're ever willing to try learning C, I'd be happy to buy you <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0393979504" class="postlink">C Programming: A Modern Approach, 2nd Edition</a> by K.N. King, which is worth every cent.  It's probably the best C book I've ever read; extremely good visual diagrams, layouts, clear explanations, and great real-world examples.  Having some assembly background (meaning conceptually) really helps when it comes to understanding C, especially pointers (the #1 thing people have trouble grasping -- but assembly programmers tend to say &quot;oh it's just indirect addressing, got it&quot; and that's the end of it), and some of the syntax (no argument, it get a little hairy at times).  Just let me know + get an Amazon wishlist + add it and it'll appear.<br /><br />And as for those PC prices: I'm the one laughing.  Those really aren't very expensive.  Shall I scan or photograph the sales receipt for my Apple IIGS, circa late 80s?  Or maybe point you to <a href="http://www.vintagecomputing.com/wp-content/images/retroscan/morrow_hd_large.jpg" class="postlink">something like this</a>?<br /><br />Know your roots.  And in knowing your roots, realise how ridiculously affordable computers/technology is today.  What you get now, for how much you pay now, is pocket change compared to then.

Remember the RAM requirement deals with the fact that PCs have to load everything into RAM to be able to do anything at all =P<br /><br />Back on the question of the thread title: does anybody know if the Mortal Kombat ports look like they're made in C? (I know the Mega Drive ports are, in fact I wouldn't be surprised if they just used the arcade code which is also in C)

It's a fact the syntax of C becomes awful as soon as you start using pointers (and you HAVE to be using pointers to do anything in a meaningful way in C), the language discourage the use of pointers when in fact it's a key element of the language.<br /><br />That being said I never had any problem to the concept of a pointer thanks to my assembly background, but using them in C is at first a nightmare until you figure how everything works out.<br /><br />If you don't see what I mean and want me to provide concrete arguments I'll be happy to provide them but I doubt it's here the place to do so.
