<br />I need as much help as I can get so, here goes:
<br />
<br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">After trying every possible combination of cables, LPT port settings, various PCs and several copiers, I have come to the conclusion that my parallel port sucks for most of these old devices (and some new, like CopyNES). <br /><br />I want to buy a new parallel port card (PCI). What I am looking for is compatibility, obviously. I must work in all port settings (ECP, EPP, ECP+EPP, etc., etc.). It also must work in WIn98 and XP. Can anyone reccomend one that they know works with say, GDSF7, MGD1, CopyNES, FDSLoadr. Yeah, I know, few of you have used all of those, heh heh. Any advice you could offer though is much appreciated. I've heard some chipsets or brands work better than others, but I dunno. <br /><br />I am also looking for a PCMCIA card for my Win 98 laptop with all the same above features (only has to do Win 98, though). My laptop as is does NOT have an EPP mode, and there is no BIOS. Some old Compaqs were stupid...the BIOS was a soft bios held on a seperate partition that is impossible to restore w/o wiping the drive. You also have to be a Martian and have 12 hands to do it. Any PCMCIA card must be configurable to run true EPP, ECP, etc. without going into a real BIOS. <br /><br />I know this thread is a longshot, but I'm kind of desperate at this point. <br /><br />Thanks! <br /><br />-Rob</div>
<br />
<br />I've tried my CopyNES on 4 PCs in every port mode, and I even bought a 3 foot cable at someone's advice (to minimize noise, I guess).   It's getting to the point where I might have to send my CopyNES to someone who has one that always worksso they can test mine, just to see if my CopyNES is built correctly.

<br />I haven't bought anything from them yet but when I can't find a parallel-equipped mobo, they're who I'll try first :) They even have future-ready PCI-E boards! 
<br />
<br />Their merch can often be found dirt cheap on eBay: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://cgi.ebay.com/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&amp;item=270091121338">http://cgi.ebay.com/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?Vi ... 0091121338</a><!-- m -->

<br />
<br />The only parallel port's I've ever had trouble with were OldSchool Pentium Packard Bell systems that had an 8GB HD limit, though flipping the SPP (Bi-Directional) mode in, then back out generally fixed that. I would've had mine checked after the 3rd system.
<br />
<br />One thing you might want to try is making a boot cd/usb (or floppy, if you can) that goes to a command prompt (google windows 98 boot floppy image), and run the dos copynes software and see if that works.

<br />Well, I did try it in DOS mode too, but no luck.  In DOS mode, when I start the program, the NES stays in play mode on the TV.  Turning it off and on again sometimes brings up the white screen I think CopyNES is supposed to show, but if I go to dump a cart, it hangs at the dumping screen.  Then when I go to dump it again, the QBasic code pops up and I get a Permission Denied error.  In fact, I wrote about it here a long time ago when I was using a different PC:
<br />
<br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://nesdev.com/bbs/viewtopic.php?t=844">http://nesdev.com/bbs/viewtopic.php?t=844</a><!-- m -->
<br />
<br />The only differenece between now and then is I can just restart the computer rather than delete CopyNES and unzip it again.  That Permission Denied error is SO annoying, though!
<br />
<br />That Quatech PCMCIA card looks very good, but very expensive ($99-$125).  Also, it doesn't do ECP, which makes it incompatible with devices that require ECP, according to the Quatech rep I spoke to. Has anyone else used a different one that is much less expensive that they know works (and supports any mode)?  Loopy, you've used the Quatech for the systems I want to use it with?  And it works fine?
<br />
<br />Thanks for all the advice, guys!  I think I have enough to go on for a PCI card...now I've just got to find a good PCMCIA.

<br />I am 99.99 percent certain it will not work.  They are intended entirely for printers, and are software driven.  If you can get anything besides a printer to work with it, I will be amazed.

<br />As I understand it, most parallel port devices <em>need</em> only EPP, not ECP.

That's very strange that it supports ECP but not EPP! ECP is very complex to implement since it supports DMA, run-length encoding and uses a big FIFO o_0

<br />I realize software changes would be required.  I'm curious as to the complexity of the hardware changes (I'm a hardware newbie)
<br />
<br />EDIT-  maybe this should be in a diff thread.
<br />
<br />EDIT- just ignore this question.  I poked around google and came across some interesting (but expensive like: Elexol V2 Parallel Module ) ways to do it.  I'm better off to get the PCMCIA parallel port.
