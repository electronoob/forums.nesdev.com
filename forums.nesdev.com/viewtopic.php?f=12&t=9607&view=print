		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I have several of the first generation us Snes consoles.   Some of them output thru the A/V port RGB and others do not!  I'm scratching my head---- I've opened them both up and they identical inside except for 1 chip.  One have s-enc and the other is B ??  ( I forget the number at the moment)<br /><br />So here's my question.... Is there a way to enable the console that isn't outputting RGB to &quot;turn on&quot; the RGB?<br /><br /><br />Any help is much appreciated.<br /><br />Mark

It makes the orange glow that you can see in back of the tube.    As they heat up, the more electrons they throw off, which can affect the brightness of the picture.    When CRT's get dim, usually the heaters are wearing out or get corroded.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I have a lot of SNES and Super Famicom decks. Multi-chip, onboard APU, and 1-chip. Every single one outputs RGB. Some need 220uF capacitors on the RGBS lines. Some do not.<br /><br />The only deck that doesn't natively support it is the SNES Jr, where you have to solder wires from the RGB encoder to the MultiAV port first. You will need 75ohm resistors on the RGB lines for the Jr, as the signal is way too strong otherwise.<br /><br />I've never had to use a hair dryer on any of my monitors to get RGB video.

But I have several Snes consoles that are version 1 (the original) and don't output rgb.  I'm just scratching my head on why half do and the half don't.    It's really got me boggled<br /><br />Mark
