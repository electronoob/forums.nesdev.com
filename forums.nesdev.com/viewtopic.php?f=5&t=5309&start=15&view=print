If you have two DIP sockets, then it'd be pretty easy to do those configurations. An all ram board for a rom emulator (would need an additional cable/interface on the user side). Also, two dip sockets cause it's hard to find 8megabit flash in DIP anymore. Two DIP allows for ROM+RAM (512k+512k) too.<br /></div><br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"> Just something MooZ and I had been thinking about - for writing a tracker/music maker that runs complete on the PCE side of things (with an interface cable to a PC of course for dumping ram contents back to PC).<br /></div><br />Cool, very cool!  A while back I made somewhat of an effort to port FamiTracker's replay code to PCE, didn't get very far though because it'd just be very hacky to use.  I know some people that would definitely appreciate a TG16/PCE tracker.<br /><br />So is this unused internal ROM only used on TG16, not PCE I'm guessing?  Seems like it'd be relatively easy to put a custom BIOS in there, + a new chip select.  Then with an interface cable, you've got a hucard programmer/reader, and no need for a ROM emulator.  That was my plan for if I ever wanted to make a 1MB HuCard, to program it in-circuit like that.  But it was speculation since I hadn't investigated the unpopulated internal ROM, nor having any cool stuff to burn yet.<br /><br />I also have a ROM emulator (512kB), since it uses a 34-pin IDC cable I figured I could strip those and solder them to the PLCC pads.  Might not be as hard as it sounds (wires/pads are same pitch, at least), but I didn't try it.  But I guess that's why you'd want DIP (would make it easy for me to hook up also, heheh).<br /><br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"> Does the sPPU allow byte read/writes to vram? On the PCE, the video processor is only WORDs. It was annoying caching bytes to pair into words and such in real time. If so, that's going to be faster. That and actually having 8x8 sprite format faster too (converting two 16x16 on the fly was a pain and wasteful for vram).</div>
<br />
<br />Yeah, it looks like there's a configuration bit to set if it auto-incs when one or both of the sPPU data regs are accessed.
<br />
<br />I totally didn't consider the NES games reading back from VRAM.  Yeah, attribute tables would be the likely suspect (though it seems just far easier to buffer it in RAM, when I'm NES coding).

<br />
<br />I'll try my usual approach,
<br />
<br />1) init the screen
<br />2) get something on the screen
<br />3) get a sprite on the screen
<br />4) move the sprite
<br />5) collision detection, etc...
<br />
<br />Scrolling sounds like the most difficult part.
<br />
<br />Are there any similarities between the C64 and NES?
<br />I remember C64 sprites were very easy to use.

Synchronizing name table updates to the position of the scroll is the hard part.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">I remember C64 sprites were very easy to use.</div>
<br />NES sprites are easy too. The only issue is that they are quite small, so you need a good number of them grouped together in order to display something meaningful.

The NES, as far as I can tell, has by far the largest amount of straightforward documentation, the most populated, active and helpful community, of all consoles. In fact, I've never seen a more civil online community in my life. Do yourself a favor and make a project on the NES, you won't regret it!  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" />
<br />
<br />drk421, that's fun, that's pretty much the steps I took to learning the basics as well. Background, then sprites, then simple collision detection. Now I'm on scrolling/map data etc.

I would recommend the Commodore to any beginner wanting to program old systems.  One thing that I've found helps for learning, is the availability of printed reference material.
<br />
<br />You know what?  If NESdev printed a book about NES programming, I would certainly order one.  Especially if it contained a guide for beginners.  It could use material from the wiki and raise funds for the site.  What do you think?  Is this a realistic idea?

<br />
<br />I've seriously thought about writing a NESdev book.  It would be a lot of fun to do, but I would need a lot of help with the editing because I've never written a book before.  And a lot of help with it otherwise, to make it really great.

Then we get into chapters on 6502 assembly language, nametables, sprites, the input devices, scrolling, raster effects, audio, compact data representation (maps and music), etc.
