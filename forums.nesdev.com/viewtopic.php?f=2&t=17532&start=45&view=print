Even if you could somehow identify what's constant and what's variable in any given CHIP-8 program, you'd still have to map this somehow, in order to know what goes in ROM and what goes in RAM. In addition to that, you need RAM for the emulator itself, there's a lot of state to maintain.<br /><br />You're only doing the math and adding up as much RAM as you can, but like you said, you don't have much programming experience, so you're probably not thinking of practical ways to allocate and access all this scattered RAM. Trust me, this won't be fun, or efficient.<br /><br />If you insist on using a &quot;bare bones&quot; cartridge configuration for this, you could go with a CHR-RAM cartridge (e.g. UNROM), and you'd have an entire pattern table (i.e. exactly 4KB) to work with, since only one would be necessary to draw the screen. Being able to access it only during vblank or forced blanking would still be pretty limiting, but if so many CHIP-8 programs work fine with so few instructions per frame, that might just work.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />If you decide to go through with the project, you're obviously free to implement this in any way you want. I'm just warning you, as an experienced programmer, that the kind of memory mapping you're trying to do in real time is extremely impractical, and will add a lot of unnecessary complexity and computation overhead.<br /><br />I do understand the fun aspect of a programming challenge, but there's a difference between fun and masochism. Simulating another machine inside the NES is fun, but it's a known fact that to simulate a machine, you need a superset of said machine, and trying to do it with less resources than that will only lead to frustration and/or subpar results.<br /><br />Maybe it's just me, but I'd much rather claim that &quot;I made a proper CHIP-8 interpreter on the NES that runs all programs well&quot;, than that &quot;I made a CHIP-8 interpreter that runs some programs and does it at a fraction of the speed the NES CPU allows because my memory layout is so limited&quot;. If a &quot;challenge&quot; significantly compromises the workflow and quality of the final product, that's not fun, it's unnecessary masochism.<br /><br />I'll stop arguing about this now. This is not my project, so if you're really going to pursue this, you're free to do it however you want. I'm just trying to give you GOOD advice, since as an unexperienced NES programmer you might not have considered all the ramifications of the crazy idea that is simulating a contiguous block of memory using all the bits and pieces of memory the NES has, and that's without even considering that you don't need only the memory the CHIP-8 uses, the interpreter itself needs RAM to function. You're just looking at the raw numbers and going &quot;yeah, 3.5KB is almost 4KB, that'll do it&quot; without actually considering HOW you're gonna make that work.

You can't treat them interchangeably. You can only access PPU RAM from the CPU during vertical blank (~10% of the frame time), and that access is much slower than with CPU RAM, so whatever you're planning to do here could easily end up cutting the speed of emulation down 50x.<br /><br />Even with CPU's onboard RAM, probably 3 pages (768 bytes) of this aren't really usable for your emulation. (The three relevant concepts are: the Zero Page, the Stack, and the OAM buffer.)<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">orlaisadog wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">No OAM needed.</div><br />You might think the internal OAM is another 256 bytes of storage, but in reality this is even <em>less</em> practical as general purpose RAM than PPU RAM is. The constraints for this one are kind of insane, so I won't go into it, but under normal circumstances this is considered &quot;write only&quot; memory. (This is also related to why we usually reserve a 256 byte page of CPU RAM as a buffer to be copied into OAM.)<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">orlaisadog wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">And software is free. Hardware is not.</div><br />Software is not free. It costs time.<br /><br />The hardware for 8k WRAM will add &lt;$1 to a board. The software constraints you're putting on will add many, many hours of extra work to the project, or more likely just make it impossible. That $1 per board would normally only matter if this was a mass market venture where you could sell enough copies to overcome the extra work it necessitated.<br /><br />According to bootgod's databse <a href="http://bootgod.dyndns.org:7777/stats.php?page=3" class="postlink">17% of NES games had WRAM</a>, (and 25% had CHR-RAM) so it's really not an unusual thing to have in the cart at all.<br /><br /><br />Another thing to consider is how to get your CHIP-8 program into the cartridge. That 8k WRAM could be treated as battery backed RAM, allowing you to use it to store the individual program, which is probably a lot more convenient than having to recompile each program directly into the ROM.
