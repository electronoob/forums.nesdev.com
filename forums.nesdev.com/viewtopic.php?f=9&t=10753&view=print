Sure, I could get some random cart PCB (Donor, Repro Cart, etc,.) and ask someone to print over 1,000 copies of it (or even print some of my own), get a 3D printer and scanner to scan &amp; print the cart shell + get some compatible screws, and either get someone who's willing to solder the EEPROMS (and possibly battery), have a machine do it, or even have myself do it, but do any of you know what company can produce such things?<br /><br />As for the boxes and manuals: That's taken care of.  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />

Allot of the new 3D printing is a XYZ controlled flow of melted poly plastic. Just in the news here, there was concern about '3D printed' plastic guns with no metal parts, so seems like it is kind of robust.<br />The Issue that I could see is the finish. As I understand one need to sand the finished object for a fine finish, but I've only read about the whole process.<br />Yogi

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Bregalad is thinking of one of the plaster-based ones, which are what most of the moderately-cheap-but-better-than-hobbyist 3d printers use.<br /><br />Modern 3d plastic extruders work moderately well for specific shapes, but between the lower softening point of PLA and ABS, the lower strength of both the plastics, and the extrusion-based assembly, you'll have difficulty making two parts mate as cleanly as well as you might want. Works ok for a one-off, though.<br /><br />If you're actually looking to make 1000+, definitely look into getting a real injection mold made. Lost-wax casting (or in this case, lost plastic master) is possibly easier than a real CAD solution.<br /><br />For a one-off, getting someone with a CNC mill to make it using subtractive processes might be better.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Yeah I once thought I was going to print decent NES cases with a 3d extruding/reprap printer.  It's not reasonable for production use though.  The guy making my NES injection molds printed out a prototype with his 3d printer and it turned out plenty sturdy, but has mating issues like lidnariq brought up.  Good for a one off, but that's about it.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">lidnariq wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">I've only got centiinch calipers, but the cartridge edge is just under 50mil thick on my copy of A53, and a NES-CNROM-256-05 board I have is just barely over 50mil.</div>Yeah they're 1.7mm just like the originals.  The pitch of the connectors is as identical to the originals as I was able to measure with my calipers.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">qbradq wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">infiniteneslives.com sells pre-assembled boards (including flash, ram and battery) for a few popular mappers including Color Dreams, MMC1, MMC3 and FME7, and can do just about any discrete mapper you want by special request.

Current schedule on the mold completion is ~March of next year.  If you're looking for any details let me know.

I don't really want to get into the nitty gritty drama of the issues I had with the second batch in public, defacing retrozone is not my goal.  So lets just say with the second batch it became apparent that if I wanted a reliable supply of cases in sizable quantities, I needed to obtain my own mold.  That said, I have had good experiences ordering things from retrozone that were listed in stock and available for immediate checkout.
