If the beam isn't interlacing it is concentrating twice as much light on half the space (i.e. no change in overall intensity vs. interlaced mode). There is no equivalent range of intensity on an LCD with emulated scanlines. Plus CRTs are brighter than LCDs just as a baseline factor, even before taking into account scanlines.

But, if you look closely, that effect is actually a consequence of the delta-gun shadow mask and phosphor dot layout.  In fact, the monitor is rotated 90 degrees; the electron gun is actually sweeping vertically.  I bring this up to point out that &quot;scanlines&quot; are not just the result of highly focused beams.

But for anything with the more conventional triangular electron gun arrangement...

The pic posted earlier in this thread was apparently too blurry.  Though, I have seen machines where the pseudo-horizontal-scanlines were highly pronounced with clear gaps between the rows.<br /><br />Also, I always wondered why a brick pattern is used as opposed to what you see in Trinitron monitors.  Was it due to technological limitations or was it an attempt to reduce visible scanlines?
