<br />
<br />Wow! That's amazing. If you get that thing to run on a real NES it'll be the coolest thing made for the NES to date.
<br />
<br />I find the distorted perspective cool. 3D on retro machines is usually very "vanilla", and it adds a bit of flavour. I'd love to see a version with one palette entry reserved for each of the visible faces of the cube and a nice color ramp for shading.
<br />
<br />I've been thinking about doing something like this, but considering all the tricks you've mentioned in this thread I never thought of and the speed you got it running at there is no chance in hell I would have been able to pull it off.
<br />
<br />Kudos!

By initially placing the PPU address at $3f00 and then writing the other three entries in rapid succession (i.e. preloading values into A/X/Y and using an indexed dummy read to skip over the background color) the "buggy" span is reduced to nine clocks plus whatever variance you've got in your synchronization method. The annoying part is that Nestopia and Nintendulator set the sprite overflow flag at very different parts of the scanline (and I wouldn't be the least bit surprised if real hardware is different still), so I'd have to use some other timing mechanism to get hblank uploads to work.<br />At any rate I figure it just isn't worth the compatibility nightmare since splitting up the character upload loop and inserting the palette code somewhere in the middle would work nicely, it'll just mean a shitload of extra work for me..<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">Celius wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">Yes this looks very good.

<br />Are you certain all of these work on the NES? the NES cpu is a <em>modified</em> 6502 after all. Couldn't those modifications alter the behaviour of the undocumented opcodes?

That wouldn't have changed the values of the don't cares in the decoder gate array, which is where most of the extra instructions come from. But anything that involves $EE or $EF or $11 or other values where bit 4 is prominent might have changed behavior, as those values seem to originate from decimal mode.
