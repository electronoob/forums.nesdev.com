I've played all 96 levels and there isn't a single level that lags with 3 fishes and a Yoshi.<br /><br />I don't even know which underwater level it supposed to be anyway.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I know they changed SMW for the SMAS 5-in-1 to make Luigi not a palette swap, and the save code surely coexists with that of SMAS. Perhaps they optimized some of the SMW code while they were at it. It'd be plausible because code in launch titles tends to be total crap because they were developed before the programmers learned basic optimizations, and often before the system's hardware was even settled. Or does the old one run on slow ROM and the new one on fast ROM?

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />SMA + World says SlowROM in the imbedded cartridge information. So if the original slows down and the SMA+W does not, they must have changed something about how the game runs. This could be expected since the cartridge doesn't employ bankswitching hardware to combine World with SMA.

When was the last time you compared the SMAS+W cart to an original SMW cart?<br /><br />I'm not aware of any major code changes that were made to the game, other than the addition of alternate Luigi sprites (which aren't even stored in the game's standard graphics compression format) and the gutting of the original save file menu. If there were any, surely SMW Central would have found and documented them by now.

I'm quite certain it takes more than three enemies and a Yoshi to bring the original game to its knees.
