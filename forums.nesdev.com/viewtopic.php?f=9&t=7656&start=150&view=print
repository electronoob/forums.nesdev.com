It's also versatile because you get to chose when in the scanline the IRQ will happen by using different X coordinates. You are also free to use the special tile(s) as sprites or background.
<br />
<br />The only real disadvantage I can see is that you can't have another IRQ for another 7 scanlines, and if you do want one after that you have to somehow ignore/avoid those 7 extra IRQs, something that might require timed code.
<br />
<br />EDIT: Wait, did I misunderstand the idea? Are 13 address lines enough to detect access to a specific byte in the pattern tables? Actually you wouldn't even need the lower bit, since detecting access to just one of the bitplanes of a tile is enough to know it's being rendered... This would be great, and the problem I mentioned above wouldn't exist.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />If you get it such that the IRQ occurs when the PPU fetches
<br />0FE0 or 1FE0 specifically, then the IRQ would fire when the PPU renders the top row of tile FE from either pattern table. An advantage would be that this could be either a sprite tile or a BG tile. Stick tile FE at the end of your status bar, and you can split the screen to your playfield; no sprites needed.
<br />
<br />So basically, this is a similar idea to MMC2, except it fires an IRQ instead of bankswitching.
<br />
<br />This would require:
<br />(PPU A-lines)
<br />/A0 * /A1 * /A2 * /A3 * /A4 * A5 * A6 * A7 * A8 * A9 * A10 * A11 * (A12?) * /A13 * /RD
<br />
<br />Where A12 can be either A12 (for pattern table 1), /A12 (for pattern table 0), or omitted if you want the IRQ from both pattern tables.

<br />
<br />I remember some years ago during previous mapper discussions, the 74HC670 wasn't available either, but now Mouser sells new ones.  Kinda weird.
<br />
<br />I like the PPU IRQ, that's what I've put into my small CPLD mapper.  The lowest address it takes in is A4 though.  I had thought about the disadvantage of what tokumaru said, that you're going to get an IRQ per line for 8 lines.  But my reasoning was that maybe it's not as often you'd want multiple splits, compared to just using one or using one every line for some effects.  But yeah putting code to skip it after the first time adds overhead to the IRQ routine, and disabling it for a time requires a deterministic delay.
<br />
<br />But the other reason I thought it was good idea in my case to have it operate like that, was because it can also select CHR banks.  This would make, for example mid-line CHR switching pretty easy to use, compared to having it only switch on an exact pixel (instead of every pixel).  I'm not sure what all the applications of it may be, but a simple one would be having a text box where the font doesn't use any of your background tiles that are outside the box.  So I'm pretty curious to see how it'll work out in practice, hopefully it won't be too long now.

<br />
<br />Anyway, you will only get 8 consecutive IRQs if you <em>don't</em> decode the lower 4 bits of the PPU's fetch address. Remember, you'd be looking specifically for 0FE0 or 1FE0, which is only the <em>first row</em> of the first plane of tile FE in their respective pattern tables. That's only fetched once for each time tile FE gets rendered.

<br />That's the perfect way to go about this! I'd definitely code for a mapper with this feature.

<br />Maybe FE can fire on the first row, and FD can fire on the last row?
<br />In this case, you'd be looking for two addresses: 0FE0/1FE0 and 0FDF/1FDF.
<br />
<br />Alternatively, you could have a 4-bit latch, and just look for 0FEn/1FEn with n being the value of the latch. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" /> That way, you could specify which row of tile FE you want the IRQ to fire on.

<br />That would needlessly complicate things... I honestly consider this to be a very minor issue.
<br />
<br />I just though of another thing... since sprite patterns are fetched at the start of HBlank, IRQs generated by sprites would always happen there, and for most raster effects you'd have to wait a whole scanline until the next HBlank. Not an issue, just an observation.
<br />
<br />Another important detail is the order in which the PPU fetches sprite patterns... is the priority of the sprites respected? If I use the sprites with higher priority does that guarantee that their patterns will be fetched at the same time every frame regardless of the other sprites that share the scanlines with them?

<br />I don't know about famiclones, but on an NES, I believe sprites are fetched in the order that they are placed into secondary OAM, which respects priority.

<br />Yeah, I was just thinking about this during my commute this morning. When you use BG tile $FE, the IRQ will trigger wherever the top of the tile appears onscreen (actually, a bit to the right, but that's aside the point), and when you use a sprite with tile $FE, the IRQ will always trigger at the end of the <em>previous</em> scanline the top of the tile appears on. That's more of a gotcha for developers though, they'd just need to keep this behavioral difference in mind.
<br />
<br />Yes, sprite priorities (as in, the priorities among the sprites themselves, not BG priority) would be respected. Given this, sprite 0 will always cause an $FE IRQ on PPU cycle 260. No other sprite has any similar guarantee though, it's just sprite 0.

<br />
<br />I've been curious about having my CPLD board support the next CPLD step up, I believe I could fit a CPU-cycle counter IRQ by dropping on a 72-macrocell in place of a 36-cell one.  I probably could support it on the board, it'd just cost a few extra bucks for that version.  I do like the idea of having that, then you can do all sorts of fun stuff with the $4011 register.

<br />Good call! When I first read Tepples's IRQ idea (and then Tokumaru's follow up), I noticed how similar it was to MMC2/4, and recalled that MMC2/4 used tiles FD and FE (but not FF). That's why I changed the idea to use tile FE when I posted about it; if Nintendo's developers used FD and FE, but not FF, there probably was a good reason. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" />
<br />
<br />But yeah, dummy fetches to tile FF are made because of how the secondary OAM contains dummy data of FFs (save for the first unused byte) when there are less than 8 sprites. I just went to look this up on the wiki so I could add this nugget of info to the PPU rendering section. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" />

<br />I imagine that if you always use the topmost sprites (from 0 up) for IRQs and those don't appear on the same scanlines, it should OK (i.e. if you use sprite 1 for a second IRQ after sprite 0 has been fully rendered, both would happen at the same point in the scanline).
