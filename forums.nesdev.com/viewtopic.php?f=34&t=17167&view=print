		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Since 2012, my ultimate intent has been to put together a multicart with 53 games on it. And I want these games to be as polished as possible, to provide a stark contrast to an infamous release by Active Enterprises. Thus after the second compo, I wrote a <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/viewtopic.php?f=5&amp;t=11331" class="postlink">pitch for a remix compo</a> to be held after the fourth compo.<br /><br />That time has come.<br /><br />But if you're planning to make a Game Of The Year Edition, be aware that despite the name, you probably won't be able to license the song &quot;Somebody That I Used to Know&quot; for your GOTYE.

SRAM. (I have an idea that would work better if you can save).

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I had envisioned &quot;remix&quot; as meaning you improve your past entry or you improve someone else's past entry. The aim is that the updated version supersedes the older versions, just as the post-compo version of a game supersedes the judged version. I didn't want to call it &quot;adding polish&quot; because then every game would have to live up to <em>Gruniożerca 2</em>, which is already chock full of both polish and Polish.<br /><br />Thus a &quot;'what happens when this TV show has a guest director, and it's Stephen Spielberg' kind of reimagined version of the old game&quot; would appear to be in scope, such as an NES port of my Python remake of <em>FHBG</em> (which took it in a very different from Nova's follow-up <em>DABG</em>), or something that combines <em>NES15</em> and <em>2048</em> to use one engine.

	<tr>
		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />The extent to which I would want to continue the 64 KiB limit depends on how big of a multicart INL can replicate. I would like to prevent the final 53-game collection from exceeding that size, but I'd have to wait for Paul to reply about exactly what that size is. If, say, all 53 games were expanded to 64 KiB, that would total 3392 KiB. The judging criteria may end up having to include a &quot;value for space&quot; consideration.<br /><br />I am willing to make one concession: A remix that supersedes multiple entries or out-of-compo additions may cover 64 KiB for each such entry up to a maximum of 256 KiB. For example, something including replacements for <em>Concentration Room</em>, <em>FHBG</em>, <em>Thwaite</em>, and <em>RHDE</em> could be 256 KiB, though if I were doing that, I would hope that I can squeeze it into 128 KiB to boost value for space. So if you want to expand a game to 80 KiB, you might try to put it in the same ROM as another entry you're expanding to 48 KiB. I admit that I haven't thought through all the special cases of this where two entrants remake the same game with intent to supersede it, and both rely on sharing the ROM.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I really like the idea. One way to handle it could possibly be to contact each of the previous developers and ask if they would approve of others working with their IPs for this purpose, and then have those available in the OP of a relevant thread.<br /><br />I see no problem with multiple developers attempting remakes of the same project (obviously if the developer had previously agreed to let their project be used openly for a remake.) Seeing different intrepretations and takes on the same game would be very interesting.

I assume the ypos-based hurt mechanism is repurposed to kill off the player character if catched by the upper edge of screen.
