		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Oh and the speed of using the Wiznet chip, even in indirect addressing mode would be much faster than the SPI Microchip part.  The way the indirect addressing works is that there are four registers at the base of the MM I/O space in the Wiznet chip (thus only needed two address lines from the cart port in addition to A15 on the expansion port).  When you want to read/write from/to a memory address in the Wiznet chip's memory space, you write the low byte of the address to the first base register, then you write the high byte of the address to the second base register, and then start reading/writing.  If you set the "auto increment" flag in the third base register, the Wiznet chip has an internal address pointer that increments after each read/write.
<br />
<br />So if you wanted to read 0x100 bytes from 0x0400 in the Wiznet memory, you set the auto increment flag in the third register and then write 0x00 to the first register, then write 0x04 to the second register, then do 256 reads from the Wiznet chip.  The first read will return the byte at 0x0400 and cause the internal address pointer to increment.  The second read will return the byte at 0x0401, and so on.  Writing is the same way.  You set up the address you want to write a block of data to and then you just write the data.  I'd be interested to see if it would be possible to use the 2A03's DMA to move packets in and out of the Wiznet chip...that would be really cool.
<br />
<br />Anyway, the coding wouldn't be hard at all.  The Wiznet chip has tons of internal packet memory so the ISR for handling packet reception can just queue up a packet event in the global event loop and then return.  Deferring the packet processing to the main game loop keeps the ISR small and allows for incremental processing to be done while the game keeps going.

<br />
<br />Not possible.  The DMA on the NES is for updating the PPU sprite ram quickly during the vblank.  It is hard wired to write to $2004.  It's not targetable.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Well, I'm getting farther with Sullins.  They have an off-the-shelf part that is so close to what we need except that it is too thick to fit into expansion port.  The expansion port opening only has room for a 0.375" thick card edge connector and their part is 0.470" thick.  I'm working with them to see if they can adapt their existing part to be thinner.  I'm also about to mail them an expansion port connector from my spare NES to get a quote from them.
<br />
<br />They wanted quantity estimates and I asked them to give me a quote for quantities of 100, 500, and 1000.  I have no idea what this will cost, but I won't be surprised if the 100 quantity order will be several thousand dollars or more, making the part a $20+/piece part.  If that is the case, my plan is to contact retrousb.com and/or the sparkfun.com guys to see if they would do the initial buy and resell the parts through their site.  I don't care how this thing gets made, I just want a legitimate part that I can use in my product.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />So I got a quote back from Sullins.  They want $5300 as a setup fee and then I assume there is a per-unit charge on top of that.
<br />
<br />Unfortunately, I don't have that kind of cash laying around to throw at making a part for a NES expansion board.
<br />
<br />If you guys have any ideas on how to pull together the funds, I'm all ears.
<br />
<br />If we could put together an order for 1,000 units, then the startup fee is only $5.30 per unit and any per-unit cost on top of that gives us a total cost per unit.  I'm guessing that the per-unit cost wouldn't be more than $10/unit with a 1,000 unit order, but still, that makes the total order $15K+.  That makes things difficult.

<br />
<br />I while back I had an idea for a "backplane cart".  Of course that absurd, but with some bus buffers and multiple edge connectors (standard ones), you could have multiple cartridges, software selectable.  But anyways that's absurd, and hardware like that already exists (though rare).
