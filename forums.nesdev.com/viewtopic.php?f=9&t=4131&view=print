But honestly I'd recommend using the gray Toaster NES as it has AV and is cheap. If you have problems getting games to start, clean them, clean the connector or replace it with a new one.

<br />  (Is the NES2 A/V mod worth it?)  Ultimately yes. 
<br />(Does it TRULY provide better video and audio quality?) 
<br />
<br />Are you referring to the link? [Adding A/V to a NES2] 
<br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.gamesx.com/rgbadd/nes2avmod.htm">http://www.gamesx.com/rgbadd/nes2avmod.htm</a><!-- m --> . 
<br />
<br />Yes, you will get a slight inprovemnt in video clarity but, only slight. However you may have trouble seeing it through the jail bar destortion of the NES2 which will not be affected by the mod. You will have to fix that separately. If you compare an A/V connection to the antenna connection on the NES1, you will be able to see the level of inprovement you can expect, and yes the resolution quality of your TV will be a big factor.  
<br />
<br />(Or does it just ground the current modulator to A/V jacks?)
<br />No, it jenrly bypasis the R/F connection completly, leeving it discanected.  Of course this is at your option. 
<br />
<br />To get rid of the jail bar destortion. See, 
<br />[top loader - getting rid of bad video, lets figure this out!]

<br />You may have trouble finding what you need there, so please look at the pm I sent you.
<br />
<br />As for audio, I didn't note any problum.   However, I herd the sampler someone posted after doing the stereo mod. I now think it is something well werth doing.
<br />See,   <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://web.archive.org/web/20031222225105/www.zyx.com/chrisc/nesstereo.html">http://web.archive.org/web/200312222251 ... tereo.html</a><!-- m -->

<br />
<br />As for MottZilla's comments.  Yes keeping your games clean is a must, but even thin battry backed games can be a problum.   The reel advantaeg of the NES2 is in not haveing to wery about loosing your place in a battry backed game.  Or mesing with a finicy connecter.  It seems you have never purchased a new connecter.  Unfortunately I have, the manufacturers seem to think the tighter thay can make the pins the better, just as long as the game can still be, just barely removed, it's fine, and eny damaged thay do to the game's pins are of no consequence at all.  
<br />
<br />For the NES1, the best connecters I have found are those wich I have 
<br />reworked my self.

<br />
<br />Well, this is only an issue in maybe 1 licensed game and maybe some unlicensed games.  There are more positives to the mod than negatives, though.

<br />
<br />Not to sound like a whiner, but the problem with that thread is that it's impossible to follow and it's nothing more than a braindump.  One person found a solution, but then revised the solution 3 or 4 times during the course of the thread, making it impossible for people to determine how to fix/mod their top-loading NES to address the banding issue.  Additionally, said person never managed to fully remove the banding, only decrease the severity of it.  *blink*
<br />
<br />I considered writing a FAQ/HOWTO on this (I got 3-4KBytes into it), but ultimately gave up because the thread ultimately has no "this is what you need and this is where to buy parts; this is what you need to do and here's photos of the steps to perform" procedure for end-users to follow.  And yes, that is exactly what's needed; not everyone is an EE guru.
<br />
<br />The easier solution, if you ask me, is to shell out a pretty penny and buy the Famicom AV, then get an adapter that converts NES cart pinouts into Famicom cart pinouts.

<br />Oh, <em>yes.</em> An AV Famicom + 72-pin adapter will handle virtually every game and accessory you can throw at it (excluding some funky pirate crap and PAL stuff, but that's to be expected). It even seems to have cleaner composite output than any of my US front-loaders.
<br />
<br />The only problem I have is with the expansion sound mixing...it seems like VRC6 audio is much too loud, almost completely overpowering the NES audio in some cases. FME-7 and FDS are almost normal. Is anyone else aware of this issue, and perhaps a way to fix it?

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />The original schem I posted in the ealier thread should get ride of the problem. It's <strong>exactly</strong> the same circuit used in New Famicom (AV FC). Just forget about other schem in that thread it's either the same as mine or a crappy alternative to it.
<br />
<br />If you got bad result with this circuit you should try shielding your mod or look for better wire.
<br />
<br />But yeais just got an New Famicom and a 72 to 60 pin adapter. I'm using that for year and it's the best way to play FC and NES game without trouble.
<br />
<br />The only thing you must do on your new famicom is to add P2 port D3 &amp; D4 data line so you can use the Zapper. It's easy you just have to put 2 wire between the P2 port and the FC exp port.
