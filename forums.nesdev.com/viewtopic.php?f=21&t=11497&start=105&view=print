I don't recall any palette raster effects (i.e. all palette tricks would be screen-wide), but it does rewrite tiles on the fly (e.g. brick parallax in some underground levels), so that has to be taken into account too. Also the palette in the background plane can be set per-tile, right?<br /></div><br /><br />The GBC has a total of 16 available palettes, 8 for the BG, and 8 for OBJs (sprites). The maximum amount of colors you can display on screen  (reasonably at least) was 56 - 4 colors each for the BG, 3 colors each for OBJs -  but writing to palette data during HBlanks could technically allow you to display more than 56. Every tile in the BG has an attribute that allows you to choose which of the 8 palettes the tile will use, so yes, they're set per-tile, unlike the DMG.<br /><br />An NES mockup of Shantae would be challenging to say the least, mostly because of color-reduction as pointed out above. It's probably worth mentioning that this game was praised for its vibrant and detailed art and animation, even as the GBA was gaining traction.<br /><br />@Macbee - That's some great work <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /> I haven't played Sonic 1 for the SMS in a long time, but you certainly made me do a double take.

The GBC BG tiles could have their palettes set on a per-tile basis, hence GBC BG tiles <em>are unlike</em> DMG BG tiles, which had a system-wide palette. The GBC has no concept of a single palette that will be used by all BG tiles; the closest you get is Palette #0 being the default in VRAM since everything in the BG Tile Attributes is initially empty.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />The boot rom definitely sets things up, but not all of VRAM is touched iirc. By empty, I did not mean 0x00 specifically, just that the values are meaningless. I was under the impression that VRAM was either filled with garbage data, a constant value like 0xFF but interpreted as 0 anyway, or a combination (garbage data with bits of constant values, all seen as 0). Since the GBC boot ROM does not alter all of VRAM, it should be possible to look at what's happening to uninitialized VRAM, at least in parts. I could whip up a test this weekend if anyone is interested.<br /><br />EDIT - Actually, the GBC boot ROM appears to zero out some memory locations, perhaps as a convenience to the boot ROM and Nintendo's way of dealing with the garbage data for the game developers' sakes. I'll investigate when I get home. Sorry for causing such a technical tangent in this thread :p<br /><br />RE-EDIT - Alright, so the GBC boot ROM is actually pretty nice. I gather that, except for the Nintendo logo tiles, it basically clears out VRAM before the game even touches anything. So immediately proceeding bootup, BG Palette #0 will in fact be the closest thing the GBC has to a universal BG palette as I stated before, since all tiles will point to that palette. As soon as the program starts writing to BG Attributes though, that can change.
