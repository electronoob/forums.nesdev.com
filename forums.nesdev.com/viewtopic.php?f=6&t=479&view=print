I'm not sure how to get around that so I can have just a basic - Bass, Snare, Bass, Snare beat.  Am I doing something wrong here?
<br />
<br />Also, if I don't have those two set to 'On,' I hear nothing on playback.  I have the instrument volume set at 6 as well.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />That's because if you don't have Hold note or that on, you need to set the instrument time length before you start placing notes down. If you have it on 0, it will likewise, have 0 timelength. If you put it on 1, it will be a very stacatto, short sound. You probably want it on like 5 if you don't want hold note. And if you don't have vdmsound, go get it. It really helps. Just google vdmsound, and you'll find it. It's really good for making DOS output good sound. though it makes the instruments sound slightly flat, it doesn't make them that way when you make it into an NSF. I'm done talking. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />

<br />
<br />If you have Hold Note off, then you have to set the Time Length value to something non-zero.  None of this will have any effect on the DPCM channel though.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I have a question that kind of has something to do with this forum, so I will ask it. How do you jump back really far in NT2? Like at the end of a song, if you're at block 0F, and you want to jump back to block 06, or something, how do you do that? I know you can just do this kind of stuff:
<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">C-4 01 C08|--- -- DFF|<br /></div><br /><br />That DFF will take you 256 notes past the beggining, I believe, and you can't just like jump to the middle of the song. I think if you go on the NT2 page, you can download the CV2 NED, and somehow at the end, they jump back right to the middle, and I looked at it, and I really don't know how they did it, it looks like this:<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">C-5 03 C30|--- -- D00|<br /></div>
<br />
<br />and with that segment, it carries them back to the middle somehow. Anyone know how this is possible???

<br />If you want the song to loop back to a specific section once it reaches the end, go to the order view (keypad *), move to the section you want the loop to start at, and press the space bar.

<br />Another obscure D00 trick is to use that effect in more than one channel at once, it'll skip several patterns ahead.  Rarely useful though.

<br />
<br />__________________
<br />|00 00 01 00 01 00 |
<br />....
<br />
<br />Those lines, those blocks of the song! how many can you have in a row? does it only go up to 0F? Is it okay for a song to go beyond that? because it lets you keep editing in NT2 after 0F, and I was wondering if that was either laziness in developing the program, or if you can actually go beyond that point. Can you?

<br />
<br />So yeah, you can use as many as NT2 will allow.  Which is up to 32 ($1F) unique patterns for each channel, and I think 128 rows in the order editor (which could make for quite a long and repititive song).  One of Chibi-Tech's NSFs surpasses the pattern limit by simply switching NEDs automatically once certain rows are reached in the order.
<br />
<br />NSF format is just a container, the only limit it has is allowing "only" 256 different songs per NSF.

<br />
<br />Yeah, that had been fixed back around that time, 2001 or so.  Actually I'm not sure how high up it'll go now, but I'm sure it's at least up to $3F.
