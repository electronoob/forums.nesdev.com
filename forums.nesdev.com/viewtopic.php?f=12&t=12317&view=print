		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I've been following this project on the SNESFreaks forums. My main motivation to follow the game is to follow the trail of custom music that gets produced (I like listening to new SNES music, and this is the first SNESGSS game that I've seen... not counting games made by Shiru).  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /> <br /><br />Your method of banking the music reminds me of other SNES games that had copies of its sound drivers with some modifications hanging around on the SNES. I cite Cool World and Street Hockey '95, as both had multiple sound drivers in there on a technicality (Cool World had a copy reserved for playing the Title Screen music, while Street Hockey '95 had one for the staff roll).<br /><br />I have an idea to cut down on memory consumption caused by having duplicate copies of the sound driver. Simply have one copy of the sound driver in the ROM, then have copies of a series of three pointers (six bytes total) corresponding to your music that will be loaded at $208 in SPC700 RAM. When you switch banks, you'll only have six bytes plus the filesize of whatever music you're using to load. The code to load data is defined in a way that makes this real easy.<br /><br />You can up the memory savings further if you kept track of what samples were used in what pieces of music (the ADSR table can be grouped with your song data) and then put the samples in their own section of the ROM to be plucked individually.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I tried it on my 1/1/1 Super NES with a PowerPak, and you appear to be off to a good start. So let's polish what I see here. About the hi-res text box:<br /><br /><ul><li>I'm not entirely fond of the use of colored hires text because it can be hard to read on composite. I noticed the same problem in &quot;Demo world map&quot;. I haven't tried it in NO$SNS yet to see how VRAM is laid out, but I wonder if VWF techniques combined with hi-res can help improve readability. </li><li>DOMINIC isn't supposed to represent the hot glue sculptor we know as Drakon, is he? </li><li>Does the FENNEC PUPPET become a FENNEC <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinocchio" class="postlink">REAL</a>, um, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fennec_fox#Reproduction" class="postlink">KIT</a> later on? </li><li>What kind of cultural process produces names like Gregory Perpetuus Ebenezer Hrabanus Eindhoven Dubois Quaoar van der Muhlhausen Nido sulle Colline Jr.? A name that long might result from a patronymic chain, as seen formerly in Wales and among the gnomes of <em>Dragonlance</em>, but how else? </li></ul><br />Some blinking dots in the H-IRQ test. It only happens on some resets though.<br /><br />I have a couple suggestions for the mode 7 map:<br /><br /><ul><li>Try drawing that map with interlace turned on. On &quot;odd&quot; frames, draw at distances halfway between the distance you're using for each scanline. This should reduce some of the shimmer in far areas. </li><li>For things that are suposed to stick out of the ground, such as that tower, try using software-shrunk sprites. I've posted a demo of this technique in the NES section. </li></ul><br />The music:<br /><br /><ul><li>02 crashed. </li><li>03, 04: With a slow-attacking strings sample like that, it might be better to alternate melody notes between two hardware channels so that one is releasing a note while the other is attacking. This avoids the cheap-sounding instant releases that plagued strings in a lot of Super NES RPG music. </li></ul><br />When I saw the still of the sprite animation test, I imagined a 6- or 8-frame jog, but when I tried it, I got a typical RPG Maker 1232 walk. Would smoother walking be hard? I wonder if you could use <em>Star Fox Adventures</em> as a rough model for the angles and such.<br /><br /><br />EDIT: I have screenshots of the red text.

Agree with what was said about the red text and the walking animation.  Dunno what's up with the bits of junk on the H-IRQ screen test, it happened to me the first time and now I can't reproduce it.  <br /><br />Other than that, I am extremely impressed and I'm eagerly waiting to see more!

Loading is not the problem here.<br /><br />I'm not sure what's going on, but for whatever reason the game has a chance of freezing when sending command ID 04 (which I believe sets up the volume) or command ID 06 (which plays the music), presumably because the SPC700 fails to output a zero or the SNES barely misses the signal and the SPC700 goes to a non-zero value and never goes back (or it has to do with values accidentally being ORed between the SPC700 and the SNES). Not sure why it only happens with song 2 (loading is at least successful, given that it's the largest song you have).

I've thought about scrapping it altogether, or patch up the area where flickering typically occurs with some sort of sprite-based window decoration.

VRAM space for sprites is very limited though, so I'll have to find a way to reload character data at will (maybe DMA the required section of the spritesheet into VRAM during Vblank whenever the player changes the walking direction or something …).<br /><br />Another reason for the current 3-frame walking animation is that I couldn't find any usable Furry character spritesheet except for Gengen's, from Suikoden II. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" /><br /><br />(Star Fox Adventures?
