Perhaps you could add a description of what's &quot;really&quot; going on in a separate section at most...<br /><br />I'm guessing the <em>timer &gt;= 8</em> comparison isn't done continuously either, but is some kind of &quot;underflow&quot; flag that gets updated at appropriate points...

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I really wish I could read those decaps better (electronics isn't my forte), so just throwing some stuff out there in a I-don't-know-electronics-very-well format since I finally figured some stuff out at least:<br /><br />The purple (polysilicon) acts as gates when squished between green/red/yellow areas. When high, those gates allow current through. When low, they block current.<br /><br />Green is ground, so poly high next to a green area will cause current to drain into it. Red is VCC, so poly high next to a red area will allow current to flow from it. Yellow is unpowered diffusion and basically acts like wires, only you need diffusion next to poly to make transistors for some reason - metal won't work.<br /><br />Looking at node 10094 (long vertical wire) and nodes sq0_p3 to sq0_p10, you can see two things:<br /><br /><ol style="list-style-type: decimal"><li>10094 is powered (connected to red areas - easier to see if you highlight it).</li><li>There are gates controlled by sq0_p3 to sq0_p10 that when high cause current from 10094 to flow into ground.</li></ol><br />Hence, 10094 will only be high at the top (after it has passed sq0_p3) if <em>all</em> of sq0_3 to sq0_10 are low. Therefore, 10094 must be the NOR of sq0_3 to sq0_10.<br /><br />If you keep going, you can then see that 10094 being high would cause 10512 to be low (cause it to drain into ground), etc.<br /><br />Please tell me if I messed up somewhere, or fill in some more details in electronics-noob-speak.  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" />

Of course, current is zero when nothing can sink that current (all sinking transistors off). The reason this is better than an actual pull-up resistor is that it deals better with capacitance: for the same power consumption you'll get faster rising edges with those current sources than with resistors.
