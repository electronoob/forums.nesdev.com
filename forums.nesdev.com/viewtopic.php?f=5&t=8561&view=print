		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Hello,
<br />
<br />I have a pretty general question about Final Fantasy 3 (6?) on the SNES. And since this forum is filled with people filled with knowledge, I thought you could help me.
<br />
<br />I recently received my ff3 (NTSC) snes game from eBay.
<br />When playing the game I came across a bug, which I wondered if was known to any of you.
<br />At the world map it seems like (only there) , if I enter the menus, like Items \ Relics \ Equip. The background turns black, some writing goes really wrong, and I cannot read what items (for example) I got, just their function.
<br />When I enter a town or whatever, this bug goes away.
<br />
<br />The reason why I'm asking is to determine if this is a "normal" \ known bug or if I've bought a faulty "copy".
<br />
<br />Keep in mind that I'm playing this NTSC game on a PAL console with a "Super Game Converter" (This works perfectly on all other games btw, beside the PPU protected one obviously).
<br />
<br />Thanks for all the help!

<br />There is. It's under Settings, Advanced or something like that.

<br />If by FF3 you mean FF6, I think there is a patch on Romhacking.net for a PAL version.
<br />If you mean the actual FF3 (on NES) then I also made a patch for it to run in PAL.
<br />
<br />With SNES games it's less common there is NTSC/PAL issue than for NES games, because they did their raster effects with HDMA or IRQs, and both will work fine on both regions.
<br />
<br />The biggest issue with PAL importing is sound desynchronization.
<br />I finished FF4 recently on my PAL SNES with powerpak, and there was some piece of music then a long time of silent each time because the music was 5/6 faster than the console and wasn't synced as supposed.

<br />SquareSoft must've had a strange music engine then. The SPC doesn't get any interrupts (like vblank), and instead has 3 timers, so there's no reason to trigger a music engine update on vblank (unless you're doing a demo/cutscene and need the audio and visuals to be synced).

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />No, that's not it.
<br />The 3 SPC timers, as the SPC itself, runs at the exact same speed on PAL and NTSC consoles, so does the music engine.
<br />
<br />It's the game itself which runs based on VBlanks, so it will be 20% slower in PAL, but the music will play at the same speed. Therefore technically it's not the music who finishes too early, it's the game who is too slow, but the result is the same.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Yeah, but most in-game music is just a loop that repeats over and over without any synchronization to the visuals. In those cases it should be far less annoying to have the same music tempo but different video refresh rates on PAL and NTSC consoles, compared to the NES situation where most games updated their music engine once per frame, resulting in different music tempos on PAL and NTSC consoles.

<br />
<br />I guess, as MottZilla pointed out, playing a game on the wrong console can do stuff you don't want it to do :p
<br />
<br />I will probably manage. Just wanted to hear if you guys thought it was a pirated version or something like that.
<br />
<br />Again, thanks! 
<br />I'm really amazed at how much you all know about snes in general &lt;3
