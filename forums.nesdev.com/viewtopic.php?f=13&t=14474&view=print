But now I don't know if I should hide this thread or edit your post so a spammer doesn't Google search the exact wording of the question.  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_lol.gif" alt=":lol:" title="Laughing" />  Kind of an unavoidable situation.  Well, you can edit your post if you want, or I'll come back this weekend if I don't forget and hide the thread.<br /><br />Espozo: Looks like that one isn't on there anymore.<br /><br />edit: decided to just get paranoid and edit part of your post already.  Not likely it would matter, but might as well.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />The entire point of the questions is to act as a deterrent for human beings hired to do spamming of forums.  It's not foolproof, but it works fairly well.<br /><br />There are entire companies dedicated to this task.  They speak/understand English, can bypass general captchas (because those are just intended to stop robots/software, not humans), do mathematics questions, and for everything else will Google search as they come across them.  These places are *much less likely* to bother a forum where they're forced to try and dig up &quot;semi-obscure&quot; questions about, say, a retro video game console.  The people visiting this forum, in most cases, are people who want to be involved with NES (or some form of retro console) development, and are more likely to be legitimate.<br /><br />We would rotate the questions out whenever we'd get a large number of spammers showing up on the forum, combined with me adding some circumvention techniques so they couldn't even reach the site at all (getting back HTTP 403 Forbidden) (I refuse to discuss the techniques due to them possibly using information posted here to circumvent it).<br /><br />The more simple/easy the question, the more likely spam will happen, and the more overall administrative effort has to be put forth to deal with the aftermath.  It's a constant juggling act, to say the least.

(Is it still possible?)<br /><br />Shouldn't the wiki have stricter rule for creating content, like I tried once long time ago (request account on nesdev, only nesdev user can create content) since they are both related anyway? The goal was to reduce administration task in the first place.

The traffic is too high.  Again: a simple Google search without any kind of digging will provide an answer to that question.  The people doing the spamming read/understand English, and will search to find answers -- but not spend an immense amount of time.  The trick is finding the balance -- trivia questions that would take up &quot;too much time&quot; (vs. just moving on to another forum/place), yet still being easy enough that a dedicated (legitimate) person can find the answer.  It is not as easy as you might think.
