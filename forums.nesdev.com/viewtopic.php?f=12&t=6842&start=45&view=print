<br />
<br />That depends on what you mean by bottleneck. The 65816 certainly is a barrier as you don't have a whole lot of CPU time. I'm not certain about the CPU&lt;-&gt;PPU interface (I assume you mean speed of DMA) is a huge issue. I mean everyone would love even faster DMA so you could update even more tiles and background data each frame. 
<br />
<br />Both SNES and Genesis despite their issues were able to produce amazing top quality games. There was a big thread about this sort of thing on Spritesmind forums, basically a Sega forum similar to Nesdev.

<br />It still would have slowed developers, no matter how much market force Nintendo had. Slowing their developers would weaken their position in relation to the competition. With the 65816, a lot of code could be ported very easily, with minimal changes.

<br />
<br />Sort've.  I was refering to the Snes's redundant register set.  They could've had a lot less PPU hardware registers.  It pulls my hair out whenever I need to use the PPU.
<br />
<br />The way the OAM is organized requires a lot of extra CPU calculation.  It's not running out of cpu time that I'm worried about, it's getting everything done that I worry about.  The fact that the 65816 takes more instructions to do tasks is more of a problem than it's clock speed.  Especially when you also are required to do more tasks than other systems.  It could be clocked at 14 Mhz and not make a difference for me, since I already have plenty of cpu time left to do cpu intense calculations.

<br />
<br />65816: 21.477275/6 (FastROM), instructions are 2-9 cycles or so.
<br />So, at 3.58MHz, the insruction rate ranges from 1.78M insns/sec to about 360K insns/sec
<br />
<br />68000: wikipedia says it's running at ~7.67MHz
<br />Move instructions range from 4-34 cycles, giving instruction rates from 1.9M/s to 226K/sec.
<br />
<br />The two are not in completely different leagues, despite what some might try to claim. Well written 816 code that takes proper advantage of the direct page and whatnot should run on par with 68k code running primarily from registers. The 68k does have an easier time working with 16 bit quantities, since there's no extra penalty on those over bytes.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />A fun thing to point out. I had heard 68k opcodes ate a lot more cycles, but never got raw instruction to instruction counts.
<br />
<br />Overall the 68k could do more with its instructions, SNES cannot multiply, divide, shift by more than one place, or really do anything remotely interesting to its other two registers.
<br />
<br />You waste a lot of time on the SNES juggling the index registers on the stack, and on switching register sizes around. However, you really can do some amazing low-level optimizations.
<br />
<br />There's also the SA-1, if you count it. Out of I-RAM, it's two clocks per cycle, so you can tripe your theoretical instruction counts. But more often than not you need lots of BW-RAM, which is four clocks per cycle. Could compare to the SVP to make that more fair.
<br />
<br />CPU&lt;&gt;PPU being a bottleneck sounds silly. Maybe for 256x240 output on NTSC, sure. But you can always crop the screen vertically and get a lot more time, SFA2 and similar games do this. There's enough bandwidth to play full motion video that blows away even the Mega CD. Just not enough ROM space for it.
<br />
<br />I have a hard time imagining which PPU registers they could have gotten rid of. There's a few missing bits, especailly on the enables that tend to use five or six bits. But short of being stupid and unevenly bit-packing the whole thing, it's actually quite amazing how well utilized the 64-byte region was. The PPU can do a <em>ton</em> of things at the same time.

<br />
<br />On MD one can achieve ~18KB/sec per frame in 320x240  or ~21KB/sec on 320x224, in 50Hz of course, using DMA. in 60Hz you're limited to ~11KB/sec per frame using DMA. Those figures are maximum you can transfer during a single frame without blanking anything... full blanked frame gives you ~59KB/sec in 50Hz

<br />No, there isn't, if you want to load an entire frame on the Mega Drive (assuming no cropping and such), you're looking for 4 frames per update (well, on NTSC at least, PAL has over double the amount of transfer rate in blank x_X). That's why you're meant to use sprites, tilemaps, etc. =P

<br />A full frame in either console's 256-pixel-wide mode is 256x224x4bpp, or 28 KiB. I've been quoted 7 KiB per vblank for DMA copying on SNES too. But if you cut the full-motion video to a cinematic display aspect ratio with 160 lines, I don't see why you can't easily fit 30 fps with an external FMV decoder. Imagine a coprocessor that decodes WebM from an SD card soldered onto the cartridge.
