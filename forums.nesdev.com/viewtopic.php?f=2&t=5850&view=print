<br />Phantasy Star 1 had a really cool first-person dungeon engine that I read somewhere was made possible by the BG tile flipping.

In 90% of the games sprites are required to face left and right, while background tile flipping just saves some extra space. SMS games sure have a hard time because of this. I believe the GG version of the VDP allowed for sprite flipping though.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">MottZilla wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">Although I think the SMS used an off the shelf type VDP chip</div>
<br />It didn't, its VDP was *based on* an off the shelf VDP chip (the same one used on the MSX, ColecoVision and many others) which couldn't flip sprites. I believe it didn't flip background tiles either.

<br />Using the Meka emulator you can disable vertical and/or horizontal tile flipping in the tile map viewer, so you can easily see what's mirrored and what's not.
<br />
<br />You can also easily see which tiles have high priority (above the sprites) or low priority (under the sprite). Yeah, this is another thing the SMS has that's kind of the opposite of what the NES does: the background tiles have priority bits, not the sprites (this is why in Sonic games sometimes the HUD is hidden by background tiles).

<br />
<br />Note that if you have CHR-RAM it's always possible to flip tiles in software. I know it still wastes VRAM, but at least it doesn't waste ROM.

<br />I was told it could by people on some forum that worked with the SMS/GG (don't remember which forum), but I never looked into it. I assumed it was one of the improvements made on the VDP, like going from 64 colors to 4096, but wasn't used much so that games were still mostly compatible with both systems.
<br />
<br />You know, many GG games do not take advantage of the fact that a large part of the tile map is hidden (to make scrolling easier, for example), they update the tile map as if a screen the size of the SMS one was visible, in order to make the game easy to port to the SMS I presume. So I though they avoided using the hardware flipping for the same reason, but I really don't know if the GG actually has it or not.

<br />I've seen SMS games doing that with sprites. When copying the tiles from ROM to VRAM, a 256-byte long table was used to flip every byte during the copy for horizontal flipping. Also, I believe they read the tiles upside down (bottom row first) for vertical flipping.
