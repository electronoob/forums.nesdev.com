I figured there are significant differences between the flash roms....<br />I was hoping for suggestions on where to start looking.  I know it wasn't because of game program on them (DK3 was programmed by the way, not Wizardry).<br /><br />If my programmer can read the chips (read them as if they were the MX29F1610MC) then I would think that the data and address lines are the same.  And probably the /CE and /OE as well..... whats left beside /WE...

I can't find a datasheet for the original chips, but <a href="http://www.ezoflash.com/datasheets/flash/Macronix/MX29F1610.pdf" class="postlink">here's the datasheet for the 1610</a>.  That being said, my money would still be on a soldering issue, like an improperly seated chip or soldering short.
