It would take up atleast 8 pins on the arduino, but then you'd only have to keep the most recent data on the input pins of the SR that way the arduino wouldn't have to keep up with the NES.
<br />
<br />EDIT: if your running on a SNES you'd actually need 16 pins...

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I've been playing around with a PIC24FJ64GB002 I picked up as a free sample (yay for getting free stuff as a student), and one of the really cool things about it is the fact that it's the only microcontroller I've ever seen that supports USB host/OTG in a DIP package.  It runs at 3.6V max, but it does have 5V-tolerant I/O's, and it even has a high-accuracy internal oscillator that allows it to run in USB mode without an external crystal.  So far, I've only played around with device-mode, but next up, I plan to try out the official USB mouse host-mode demo.  If I can get that working, implementing the SNES side should be a piece of cake.  So, I may have a rough working demo of USB-to-SNES mouse here in the next week or so...

It's like buying a donor cart: some people have objections.<br /><br />And yes, you'll probably need an SPI slave port on whatever MCU you choose. The mouse's report is 32 bits, and an external shift register probably won't be enough. You'll also need to support toggling the reported sensitivity, as mouse detection in commercial Super NES games relies on being able to cycle the mouse through sensitivity 0, 1, and 2.

Or in your opinion should topics that peter out signify &quot;The community has already discussed and rejected this proposal with prejudice&quot;?

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />You don't really need hardware SPI, you just need to be using pin change interrupts instead of polling.  16MHz is plenty fast enough to implement an ISR-based shift register in software, especially since the AVR architecture is almost entirely single-clock instructions.  Besides, if you do use the AVR's hardware SPI, you'll have to do some behind-the-back trickery to do a multi-byte transfer with only a single latch pulse.

Perhaps the microcontroller could have a second mode to emulate the Arkanoid paddle, which does put data on those pins.

Obviously, in order to maintain compatibility with existing titles you'd still need to send the expected data over the primary data line, but you can do whatever you want with the other two lines if you're writing your own software on the console side.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I spent some time planning this months ago, and ... never finished writing the microcode. Oh well. Anyway, once I got as far as thinking that I wanted to add support for the middle mouse button, I figured I may as well add support for all the other frequently present mouse buttons and map both axes of scroll wheel and all five buttons to things in the first (normally all 0s) byte of report on the SNES mouse.<br /><br />Of course, this is putting the cart before the horse; once you implement the basic translation, adding extra buttons to the translation is straightforward.
