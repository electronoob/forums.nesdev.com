<br />I saw this cartridge at the flea market today, it had no sticker, and had philips screws on the back instead of a game-bit..
<br />
<br />But, to my surprise, was this non-saving Zelda..  I mean, it has you create a character, but when switched off, it doesn't actually save, and I have to start over again...
<br />
<br />Here's a pic of it running...

<br />it's an NES cart, it just has no sticker (and looks like one was ripped off too)..
<br />
<br />There is no battery on the circuit...  The 10NES on the cartridge was de-soldered it seems, it's just not there, but can be...
<br />
<br />the chips are EPROMs, with electrical tape over the window..
<br />
<br />Seems like a poor mans flash cart..

<br />I'm wondering if perhaps the person got the PCB empty or something, and just built it from scratch.
<br />
<br />WRAM?  I don't think so.  It just has two EPROMs, and that's it..
<br />
<br />Instead of taking another pic (camera is charging at the moment), this is EXACTLY what the PCB looks like, it just lacks the smaller 10NES chip on the right:  <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://games.multimedia.cx/wp-content/uploads/super-mario-bros-nrom.jpg">http://games.multimedia.cx/wp-content/u ... s-nrom.jpg</a><!-- m -->
<br />(well, not exactly like that, but close enough...)
<br />
<br />In the two ROMs spots are 2 EPROMs...

<br />Like I said, it's not exactly like that in the picture.
<br />
<br />I just ripped the electrical tape off both chips (it was 1 long piece of tape), 1 is an EEPROM, the other is a chip labled W2464, and does not appear to be an EEPROM, or if it is, it's gotta be an EEPROM, because it doesn't have a window like the other one...
<br />
<br />btw, entering the first dungeon locks up the NES..  it does show the dungeon, but when the music should play, it just locks up...

<br />This is a genuine cartridge release to coincide with the launch of the AV Famicom in 1993. It's more or less a translation of Zelda back to Japanese.

<br />I accidentally had 1 too many E's <img src="./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" />  I had my new PC motherboard on my mind, as I was today messing with it's bad BIOS...  So I had flash in my mind, which I call EEPROM..
<br />
<br />It's an EPROM, the window one that needs UV light to erase, of which I have no UV light...

<br />
<br />Ah yes, now I remember watching the AV Famicom commercial on gameads.gamepressure.com, Zelda was one of the characters that jumped into the unit!
<br />
<br />Anywho, though one possibility that comes to mind is that this was an early prototype from NOA when porting the game over, the fact that the 10NES was DEsoldered(?) leaves me to believe that this is a failed fan repro.
<br />
<br />Evildragon, is there any possibility you can dump the PRG, assuming that  CHR is RAM?
<br />
<br />Also, remember to put tape back over the EPROM window when you take a picture <img src="./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" />
