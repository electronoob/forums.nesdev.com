If I try to launch some DSiWares using TwiLightMenu++, I get no sound (for example the DSiWare Maestro Green Groove). I've been told in another forum that this issue is related to unLaunch and not to TwiLightMenu++ as TwiLightMenu++ run DSiWares through UnLaunch. I then installed the game to the EmuNand and:<br />- if I run the game (Maestro Green Groove) through the DSiMenu I correctly get sound<br />- If I run the installed game directly through UnLaunch (i.e. I press A+B on DSi Power On and choose the installed game in the unlaunch file list) I get no sound (same behaviour as launching the game through TwiLightMenu++)<br />And, finally, if I run the .NDS file directly through UnLaunch I get an error (save file missing / damaged) but I think this is expected.<br /></div><br />Are you sure about Unlaunch 1.9? As far as I remember, the latest release yet was Unlaunch 1.8.<br /><br />Yes, missing sav file could be a problem... if the file file is missing (but you could fix that issue yourself (don't know if that would help on sound issues)).<br /><br />In general, sound should be for working, for example when loading Flipnote via unlaunch (either from SD or eMMC). Did you test that, too, and does it work for you?<br /><br />If some titles don't have sound... that might be due to whatever special case. Does the game use Teak DSP sound? New or old TSC mode? And are there any obvious wrong settings... like one of the vatious sound control registers muting sound output? Maybe you could see something eye-catching when runnung SD and eMMC images in no$gba.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">CrazyAlexx wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"><br />Retail carts. Pokemon soulsilver and pokemon diamond. No games work<br /></div><br />Oh, those seem to be quite expensive, and at least one them is said to have special infrared hardware (though I don't know if that's wired to the SPI bus, or to the ROM bus, and if that extra hardware is related to the problem at all).<br /><br />I am afraid that I've no idea how to fix what without having those games. Only idea would be looking at the cart header of those cartridges (or of the Maestro dsiware title). Can you post a copy of those headers? Only the first kilobyte, not the whole rom-image.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">Voodoo wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"><br />Have the same &quot;you have discovered unknown old firmware version&quot; when try to install unlaunch 1.8 on japanes 1.4.5J. Is there will be new version of unlaunch ?<br /></div><br />Yes, I'll try to get around to release something without that message next days.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=5211">nocash</a> — Fri Apr 12, 2019 6:42 pm</p><hr />
