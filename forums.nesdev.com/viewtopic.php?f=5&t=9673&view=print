Otherwise you'd have 3 remaining lives plus the one you start out with (i.e. 4 lives).<br /><br />Original Contra also behaves this way; initial screen says &quot;REST 3&quot;, but the medal counter shows 2 once you're deployed.  This is because the very first life you have is considered one of those initial 3.<br /><br />Lots of arcade games, and lots of console games as well, behave this way.<br /><br />I think you're just wigging out because Super C shows 3 medals then drops to 2 once you deploy, so visually you see the medal count decrease.  But it's effectively the same as Contra, like I said -- just that Contra shows &quot;REST 3&quot; but once you're in-game only 2 medals are shown, so you never actually watch your medal count go from 3 to 2.  :-)

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Before you start the game, all three players are in the reserve area, so it says 3. Then one comes out which you see on screen, so there are 2 left in the reserve area. The third life is right in front of your eyes <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />I realize that seeing this as a bug is thinking of it as a programmer, and the 3 being some counter that is decremented when you die, and when it reaches 0 you get game over.

You start with three lives (REST 3). You have three remaining lives (3 medals) <em>until you drop out of the helicopter</em>. Then you have two remaining lives (2 medals), plus the guy on the screen, for a total of three. Once you beat the level, the guy disappears off the screen and gets included back into the remaining lives count (REST 3). When you start the next level, there's no nifty jumping-out-of-a-helicoptor animation, you appear immediately, so you don't get to watch the medal disappear, but you still have two remaining lives (2 medals) plus the guy on the screen, again, for a total of three.<br /><br />It might not jive with the way you think about remaining lives, but it makes sense in its own way.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Oh I think you got the logic right.<br /><br />In fact, for Konami's point of view, it is the fact that the guy spawns on the screen that makes him loose a life, NOT the fact that the guy's dying.<br />That is also why the medal doesn't disappears when you die, it disappears when you re-spawn. For some obscure reason being inside the helicopter doesn't count as the guy being on the screen.<br /><br />I understand the logic somewhat, but it's really weird. For me it makes sense that you loose a life when you're dead.

I haven't made progress for ~2 years but now I made progress recently.<br /><br />The problem is that every time now that I &quot;make progress&quot; I end up tidying some stuff, removing things that are not needed and added other features that were not planned, and did not any actual progress.<br />What really stops me is to have to program enemies' artificial intelligence, which is horrible to do.
