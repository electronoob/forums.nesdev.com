They are:<br />* Low G Man and/or StarTropics, because the former is the only game that requires the absence of RAM (but it uses the MMC3's PRG RAM disable) and the entire problem here is due to the MMC3/MMC6 PRG RAM protection differences<br />* The games that used SXROM and SOROM. (FF1+2, Best Play Pro Yakyuu, Genghis Khan, Nobunaga's Ambition, Romance of the Three Kingdoms)<br /><br />Every other game could be safely emulated with 8 KiB of PRG RAM, except:<br />* Those that use MMC5, which needs somewhere between 32 and 64 depending on just how klever you're being.<br />* Those that use Bandai's LZ93D50 with IÂ²C EEPROMs, where they need 128, 256, or 128+256 bytes of EEPROM, but this division is already accurately handled by the three assigned iNES1 mappers.<br /><br />These seven games are a small enough list that marking this set of games could easily have fit in the submapper field. Since it was NOT put in the submapper field, I can only conclude that the intent of the field was to accurately represent the amount of nonvolatile storage on the cartridge. And, therefore, I have to conclude that a &quot;compatibility&quot; implementation is against the spirit of NES2.0, at the very least for the PRG RAM size field.<br /><br />Basically, my opinion is that this emulation container should handle both the &quot;simple emulators&quot; use case, as well as people making reproductions, as well as people making ROM hacks. And that means we can't <strong>just</strong> implement the lowest common denominator, but must enforce extra restrictions to keep people from assuming things that happen to be false.

That implementation flawlessly supports the ROM. It really doesn't matter whether it came on a VRC2 or VRC4 board, or whether it was a glob top or DIP, whether the PCB was red or green. It's still a completely valid setup to run that ROM. You're asking for a unique mapper to add support for a game that already has support.<br /><br />I appreciate the desire for emulation tools that can really verify hardware accuracy. I've said before and I'll say it again, I want an emulator like that too. An emulator that I can go into the options and say &quot;run this as if it was board X with jumper Y etc.&quot; and have it flawlessly validate whether it would run on that board. That would be a cool tool.<br /><br />The thing is, only a very small group of people need that. Millions of people play NES emulators, and almost all of them have the primary concern of &quot;will it play my games?&quot; The question of &quot;what would happen if I put this ROM in my Genghis Khan cartridge&quot; is an incredibly niche concern, and requires a few metric shit-tons of meticulous implementation and testing to provide. Almost nobody would even think of trying to implement all of this crap, and if we put all of it in the NES 2.0 spec, it will be very poorly adopted. Quite frankly I think you're destroying the NES 2.0 format by trying to put this burden on it.<br /><br />I would really love someone to build the meticulous hardware-oriented emulator tool. They don't need an NES 2.0 specification to do it, though. They can get to work on that right now. It really has nothing at all to do with NES 2.0... why do you want this format to do all that?<br /><br />It's very clear that kevtris' intent was to make a format that was a practical extension to the existing format to get those last handful of problem games running. It wasn't supposed to do any more than that, and it really shouldn't if we expect it to be adopted. Every unnecessary submapper that is added makes more work for the implementers, and retards proliferation of the format. Creating a schism by making a parallel spec with the same name that's incompatible with whatever kevtris is up to just makes the situation worse. It's... ugh.<br /><br />This is very frustrating. Like, I know what you want, but it's extremely impractical to expect this specification to solve that problem. Specifying the hardware details doesn't make the emulator that implements them appear. If you want that emulator, just build it. Build the shit out of it. I want to see that emulator. Arguing about the NES 2.0 specification doesn't make <em>that</em> magical tool any easier to implement. It just makes the NES 2.0 specification harder to implement, and more obscure than it already is.

WRAM sizes, especially when it's battery backed, can be helpful for emulators and tools that need to manage save files, for example. I think it's useful additional information, rather than inferring it from mapper or other heuristic info.

Compatibility requires <strong>im</strong>precision. Precision is necessary for accuracy.<br /><br />The entire reason for the wiki's <a href="http://wiki.nesdev.com/w/index.php/Program_compatibility" class="postlink">Program compatibility</a> article is to demonstrate this: these programs were made by testing against emulators that were more compatible (they implemented a superset of the NES that had the various gotchas elided) and therefore less accurate.<br /><br />Yes, it's unfair to exaggerate and use Nesticle here, but it's only a straw man in the sense that it's an exaggeration of FCEUX's inaccuracies. And I'm serious when I say that for <strong>just playing games</strong>, it really was adequately accurate, because SMB1 was a fairly grueling test of raster effects, $2007 delay, sprite 0 hit, and so on. But no-one would say that Nesticle was accurate in any absolute senseâespecially not for development.<br /><br />An emulator that allows writing to CHR/NT during rendering produces homebrew that assumes that it can write to CHR/NT during rendering.<br />An emulator that doesn't enforce bus conflicts produces homebrew that assumes the absence of bus conflicts.<br />An emulator that doesn't emulate DPCM glitches produces homebrew that assumes the absence of DPCM glitches.<br />An emulator that always provides 8 KiB of RAM mapped from $6000-$7FFF produces homebrew and translations that assume it has that RAM.<br />An emulator that doesn't implement MMC3's protection register AND always provides 8 KiB of RAM produces conspicuously wrong music in Low G Man.<br />An emulator that conflates VRC4 variants produces translations that randomly pick a different set of mirrors relative to the game.<br />&amp;c.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">[PRG RAM is] a field with practical use so he added it.

No Famicom game relies on or detects mirrors for the few games released with a 2 KiB PRG RAM, nor does any MMC5 game. The only place this matters at all is for the different ABIs for Generic MMC1 vs SNROM vs SXROM/SOROM/SUROM.<br /><br />As far as &quot;helping&quot;, a lookup table of<br />Mapper 1, submapper 2: 16384<br />Mapper 1, submapper 4: 32768<br />is really not significantly different than<br />Mapper 1, PRGRAM=0x77 or 0x80 or 0x08: 16384<br />Mapper 1, PRGRAM=0x90 or 0x09: 32768<br /><br />On the other hand, if the objective is accuracy, it's necessary to encode the actual set of restrictions that comes from the exact hardware and to precisely enforce them. And stating that VRC2 on PCB 350926 has 1 bit of &quot;RAM&quot;, or that VRC4 PCBs 352396 and 351406 has 2 KiB of RAM that can be addressed at $6000 and $6800 but not at $7000 or $7800 is precise.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">tepples wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">Especially now that FME-7 is known to support large PRG RAM<br /></div>That's an ex-post-facto justification, so not really relevant to my argument...

How well any given emulator honors the stated config is another issue, but ideally iNES should make it absolutely clear what the config is.</div><br />I might need to clarify what I mean. I'm using this specific definition of compatibility and accuracy:<br /><ul><li> Compatibility means &quot;necessary to run existing games correctly.&quot;</li><li> Accurate means &quot;try to represent the specific original hardware as closely as practical&quot;.</li></ul>Tepples wrote a relevant definition <a href="http://wiki.nesdev.com/w/index.php/Accuracy" class="postlink">on the wiki</a>, where compatibility means &quot;correct output with known ROMs&quot;, and accuracy means &quot;correct output with unknown ROMs&quot;.<br /><br />I think compatibility is a much clearer goal. The test for whether a submapper is needed is easy: for the game in question, will any of the existing ones already produce the correct output? The second part of this is that it demonstrates why someone would want to implement it, i.e. if you do this your emulator will be able to run a specific game. The third part of this is that the game provides a test ROM for correctness. If you can verify that your emulator produces correct output for the game, you know it's correctly implemented.<br /><br />Accuracy on the other hand I don't think is a practical goal for this format. If you create a <a href="http://wiki.nesdev.com/w/index.php/NES_2.0_submappers#025:_15_VRC2c" class="postlink">submapper for VRC2c</a>, you can't test it with any existing games. <em>Ganbare Goemon Gaiden</em> is going to look the same with or without the IRQ. This bit of accuracy has no practical test yet. You could easily make a mistake when implementing it if you don't have a test ROM; especially if you're implementing 100 little features at once like this and not testing any of them.<br /><br />And hey, if you want to make the test ROM for a proposed submapper, do it. Do it first, though, don't just put it in the spec and then expect somebody else to do it for you. This is basically my entire suggestion for arbitration. If there's no ROM that can demonstrate the difference yet, don't add it to the spec.<br /><br />So, the &quot;why should I implement this?&quot; question for accuracy is, &quot;in case homebrew wants to use it in the future, I want to help them with development&quot; which is a nice thought but it's impractical to think you can cover every way that a new programmer can fail simply with a file format specificatoin, or perhaps &quot;in case somebody finds an undiscovered VRC2c game that relies on the non-existence of IRQ&quot;. I think this is getting rather obscure and unnecessary. Compatibility as a goal keeps the spec compact and gives a clear guideline for what to implement, and what you're supposed to get for implementing it. Accuracy is more of a lifelong pursuit with no clear boundaries.<br /><br /><br />I love all the great hardware/accuracy descriptions that the wiki has (and it continually grows); this stuff is wonderful. An emulator with an option to turn on bus conflicts, PPU rendering address conflicts, enforcement of other weird rules that aren't needed for compatibility would be AWESOME. I just don't think this is a good goal for NES 2.0 specifically. iNES certainly wasn't aiming for that, and kevtris' goal was to extend iNES; he said as much a few posts back, it was explicitly compatibility (plus a few arbitrary extra things he wanted).<br /><br />The stuff currently in the article (with the exceptions of <a href="http://wiki.nesdev.com/w/index.php/NES_2.0_submappers#021.2C_023.2C_025:_VRC2_.2F_VRC4" class="postlink">VRC2/VRC4</a>, and <a href="http://wiki.nesdev.com/w/index.php/NES_2.0_submappers#001:_5_Fixed_PRG" class="postlink">SEROM/SHROM</a>) all have test cases, and nothing re-assigns any of kevtris' assignments now that Tepples re-instated MMC6. The stuff that kevtris allocated that doesn't have any test cases yet should be left out of the spec until they get used in the future someday. It's not like we can't add things in the future as they happen. Same deal with all that proposal stuff. If there's no test ROM, leave it out. For stuff that's not in kevtris' spec, I see no problem with us allocating new things that he didn't think of, just so long as we don't reassign his original ones. There's plenty of room here. Same deal with the WRAM fields; leave things in a way that's compatible with kevtris' version; it's really not hard to accomodate this. There's no need for a format schism.<br /><br /><br />TLDR version, this is really what I'm getting at:<br /><br />1. A test case, like a game that won't run without it, or even a test ROM should be a <em>minimum standard requirement</em> <strong>before</strong> allocating a submapper.<br />2. Don't redesign kevtris' format or reassign older allocations.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I get what you're saying now. I supposed I'd mostly support compatibility. <br /><br />On VRC2c, I think I disagree with you. We have a hard example, and that should be accounted for somewhere. If an emulator chooses to support that by using the generic VRC core rather than VRC2c strict, that's the author's decision. If I were personally writing an emulator my goal would be strictness, and I'd want to know the actual cart config is VRC2c. It seems like a bad idea to omit that info when it could be clearly provided. <br /><br />Otherwise I would agree on declining new assignments without a test rom or physical cart.

We don't have to limit ourselves to only known hardware cases, but anything known should be at least specified as such. And again if an emulator author chooses to support that with a generic implementation so long as there's no case to force the strict implementation, I can't argue with that.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Also I think it's bad that we've overspecified the submappers for VRC2/VRC4. 45 assignments have been made for only 8 existing variations, and the VRC2-only specification only has one possible assignment (in 2 cases already used up). I think it would be a lot better to just assign submappers 0,1,2,3 to the existing cases instead of devising a scheme to accomodate fictitious ones.<br /><br />Since VRC2/VRC4 wasn't in kevtris' original set and there are no current test cases, I would presume this is still open for debate, but if we want to stick with it I wouldn't fight it. Just saying I think it's a bad idea.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Are you referring to deriving the submapper from the address line numbers? If so I'd agree that's overly complicated, and handing out submapper assignments in order for known cases would be preferable. Maybe leave a few blank spots between vrc4/2 groups, e.g. vrc4 starts at 1 and vrc2 start at 10 or so, as a sort of logical grouping. That's mostly for human readers.

I think I've done this for each of the submappers currently in there and I'd like to see this standard applied in every one that gets added.<br /><br />What I'm really after is that the spec on the wiki should be in an implementable state, and part of that means already proven and testable. Every allocation is a request that many emulators should implement it. I don't think it's too much to ask that a person make and test ONE working implementation of it before they request many implementers to go at it. (It's also important for consistency and correctness.)<br /><br />Like, I don't really want to quibble about ideology for whether this or that variation needs a specification. That's thoroughly exhausting (and seems rather fruitless so far). If there's a ROM for it, go ahead I guess, but just run it by people first so we make sure it's not already covered, or improperly described, etc. and keep continuity with earlier versions of the spec.
