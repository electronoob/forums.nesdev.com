Pretty neat.  Not having worked with the 65C02, I didn't realize it has a single-cycle NOP.<br /><br />Previously I had considered making an NES mapper with separate program and data banks.  My idea would have just been memory-mapped registers and not anything as fancy as what that guy made.  We don't have the SYNC signal, but you could emulate a 6502 inside the mapper to generate one.  Considering that though, to me made it sound more attractive to just add some memory and run the emulated 6502 independently and faster.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=10">Memblers</a> — Fri Feb 16, 2018 4:36 am</p><hr />

I was rather intrigued by this idea when I found the article ~year ago.  Had thought about how it would be interesting to apply some of these methods to the NES with a mapper.  Utilizing undocumented NOP's to create new 8/16bit registers, far addressing, and other functionality could be of great benefit to a C compiler if one were so motivated to put in all the hardware and software development required.  Problem with that idea is assembly isn't actually as bad as many make it out to be, and you could make a number of games/tools with the work involved with something like that and not become dependent on high end hardware.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=4832">infiniteneslives</a> — Thu Feb 15, 2018 8:29 am</p><hr />

Just to give a TL;DR (although I thought it was a quick read):<br /><br />* Use two 74'670s to yield four bank registers (he calls them K0 through K3)<br />* The /SYNC output on the 65C02 lets him capture, intercept, and replace opcodes from memory before it enters the CPU. This is microcoded using external ROMs<br />* Forces all stack and direct-page accesses to only bank 0, while normal execution happens from K0<br />* Opcode prefixes (like the Z80 or x86) let him force the following instruction to always use a different bank register for the data portions of that instruction<br />* special hardware-optimized implementation of NEXT for fast FORTH performance<br />* function to copy just the computed address from (zpg,X) into a pair of zeropage registers<br />* special ZX80-like &quot;emit bytes starting at this address as a scanline of pixel data&quot; instruction<br /><br />And one last interesting bit:<br />* This 65C02 retains several of the &quot;multibyte nop that does memory accesses&quot; of the NMOS 6502, specifically: $82, $C2, and $E2 are still <tt style="margin-left: 2px; margin-right: 2px; padding:3px; background-color: #3355aa; color: white;">NOP #imm</tt>, $44 is still <tt style="margin-left: 2px; margin-right: 2px; padding:3px; background-color: #3355aa; color: white;">NOP zpg</tt>, $54, $D4, and $F4 are still <tt style="margin-left: 2px; margin-right: 2px; padding:3px; background-color: #3355aa; color: white;">NOP zpg,X</tt>.
