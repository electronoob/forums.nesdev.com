ok, I found out I can write flash with my device and with my software. But I thought the NROM only let you use chips that were 128 or maybe 256 kb. Also, what chips would be directly compatible? I have heard of the 29F256 being directly compatible (no rewiring) , but I really don't know. I have 27C256 chips and those work without having to be rewired in the socket. I would like to keep my sockets without rewiring, if possible. Thanks, and wish me luck!<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=450">arfink</a> — Wed May 03, 2006 11:50 am</p><hr />

<div class="quotetitle">arfink wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"><br />My programmer probably does not support flash at all.<br /></div><br /><br />It'd be worth finding out, on xeltec's site.  If it can write SRAM, it should be able to write flashrom too (hardware-wise at least, I dunno about the firmware/software).  Look up chips like AMD 29F040, or Atmel ones like 29C256 and 29C040.<br /><br />There are SRAM chips you can get with the battery built-in.  Lots of ones made by Dallas, I can't remember the part #s though.  But they look expensive and physically huge (nothing's really gonna fit in an NES cart case with a socket though anyways).  I see them on ebay a lot but don't know if I'd recommend using those.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=10">Memblers</a> — Sun Apr 30, 2006 6:26 am</p><hr />

I have a couple of eproms that seem to work just fine in my current mapper 0 cartridge, and I have a nice retired xeltec chip programmer that my dad brought me from where he works. That is fine, but what I don't have is a UV light to erase the chips with. I am looking for something which I can rewrite frquently, but not on a constant basis like some people using CopyNES want to do. I am mostly just messing with some basic stuff, and what I really want is to have a set of development carts for common mappers. But I need to start someplace simple. If SRAM is hard to do, is there possibly some sort of EEProm I could use? My programmer probably does not support flash at all.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=450">arfink</a> — Sat Apr 29, 2006 3:25 pm</p><hr />

Having RAM or FlashROM on the cart is no use if you can't get your program onto it.  And I'd recommend flashrom over RAM, unless you're wanting the NES to have extra RAM to use.<br /><br />The cart that connects to MIDI is Midines (<a href="http://www.wayfar.net/" class="postlink">http://www.wayfar.net/</a>), it uses a version of the board I designed for my Squeedo devcart (which I'll be releasing sometime, right now cable building is an issue and also firmware development with the PIC18F chip).<br /><br />It depends on what you want to do with this cart, do you want to rewrite it every week or every few minutes?  And do you want it to run mapper #0 games, or you want it to run your own code?<br /><br />I don't know what tools and chips and stuff you already have to work with.  There's several ways to make a devcart, the best way depends on what you want to do with it.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=10">Memblers</a> — Sat Apr 29, 2006 10:11 am</p><hr />

This has nothing to do with SRAM in $6000-$7FFF, which you correctly state is provided only by MMC1, MMC3, MMC4, MMC5, and MMC6. Arfink is talking about rewiring a cart to use SRAM instead of mask ROM or flash memory.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=9">tepples</a> — Sat Apr 29, 2006 6:28 am</p><hr />

Battery backup needs additionnal logic that mapper 0 doesn't have. Use mapper 1 (MMC1), 4 (MMC3) or 5 (MMC5) only for battery backed games (the mapper 10, MMC4 also have battery backup possible but I doubt you'd be using that mapper).<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=38">Bregalad</a> — Sat Apr 29, 2006 12:38 am</p><hr />

I have seen some people who make battery backed ram carts for mapper 0. Does someone have schematics? Or instructions? I don't want to have to build a whole copyNES. I have heard there is one that connects to a MIDI (joystick) port somewhere. I am a noobie, so please be nice and help me out. This is my second nes project hack and my first cartridge hack. Thanks in advance guys.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=450">arfink</a> — Fri Apr 28, 2006 7:19 pm</p><hr />
