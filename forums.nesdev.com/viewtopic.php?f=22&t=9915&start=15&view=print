The wiki said that you read the mic from the $4016 adress so I made a program in Family Basic (currently my only way of running my own code on my Famicom) like this:<div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">10 PRINT PEEK(&amp;H4016);<br />20 GOTO 10</div>This program keeps printing the value in $4016 forever. That value is normally 64, but whenever I blow into the mic it changes to 68 until I stop blowing. Knowing this I can make programs in Famibe that detects &quot;sound&quot; or &quot;no sound&quot;. But how can a game detect different waveforms?

But the game can't tell the slider's state.<br /><br />At Famicom World we have the most complete list of Famicom games that supports the mic n English that I know about. Some of them retain the mic function in the NES version but not all. <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.famicomworld.com/forum/index.php?topic=2355.0">http://www.famicomworld.com/forum/index ... pic=2355.0</a><!-- m --><br /><br />Zlash I tested the update and now it's much better. There are still some spots that doesn't show the lyrics in advance though.

Wouldn't work in most emulators though if they don't start supporting a mic input from a real mic.<br /><br />Zlash I finally picked up an everdrive and I tested your game on my Famicom. I finished it to the end, and it wasn't as hard as I previously thought. I guess I played it on a slow emulator/computer before. However I couldn't get the mic to work, although it works in other games that supports it.<br /><br />I must say I love the music in this game though. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" />

Nestopia is the only emu I know with mic support and it works there, but I should guess that is mostly a hack. Nothing ever happens with mic input? Not even triggers a miss? How I wish I had real hardware to test <img src="./images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" alt=":(" title="Sad" /><br /><br />And as for the music, everything this thing lacks as a game, its compensated with good tunes.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Thanks for the update!!<br /><br />I heard that the mic was oversensitive so I did something werid to get something decent.  Obviously , without access to hardware it was kinda pointless because it was just a guess. I don't even know why I thought it would help back then. I guess its just another proof of being a bad programmer <img src="./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" /><br /><br />What I'm doing is the following:<br /><br />- Set a mic_input flag to true.<br />- Then, when I read 8 times $4016 to fill the byte with joystick status, I check everytime the microphone bit. If I find a 0 in one of those 8 reads, I set mic_input to false <br /><br />Truth be told, I don't even know if the mic bit is able to change that fast.  But maybe this has something to do with it.
