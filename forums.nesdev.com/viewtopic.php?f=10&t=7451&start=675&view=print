If it's in another folder somewhere then some *other* file would have to be created to keep track of the fact that that debug file is associated with the NES file somewhere else.  Maybe the tool would put that association in the registry but then a different group of people would complain about their registry being &quot;polluted&quot; with a key representing the NES/debug file association for each NES file they ever opened.<br /><br />By the way, your web browser is creating hundreds of files just so you can read this message... <img src="./images/smilies/icon_eek.gif" alt=":shock:" title="Shocked" />

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />When it puts unneeded garbage in your project folder, you'd be a sheep not to dislike it. And plus the folders option works for EVERY other feature in FCEUX, why not the debug files? Makes zero sense. If the file was useful though, like NESASM3's list of all the pointers and stuff, I'd be okay with it. A debug file that you don't need after you recompile the project/close the ROM should have an option at minimum.<br /><br />And by the way, it isn't putting it in my document or any other files directory, so it's not helping your case to bring up my web browser.

I don't care even a little bit, and I'm obviously not a &quot;sheep&quot; because (like you) I use nesasm despite more recommended alternatives. I actually prefer FCEUX's behavior. Nintendulator hides away potentially huge files when you use its debug logging. Then I have to actually navigate to its directory to delete them just to free the massive amount of hard drive space they can take up which is much more annoying for me, personally. But no one is &quot;a sheep&quot; or wrong because they prefer that behavior. I can see why they would. At least FCEUXs default allows them to be easily destroyed with a batch like Tokumaru and Shiru do. Customization <em>would</em> be better, but eh. Whatever.

Then, to know if a number is larger than the other, you check the state of the carry flag afterwards. If it's clear, the 1 was borrowed, meaning that the second number was larger than the first.
