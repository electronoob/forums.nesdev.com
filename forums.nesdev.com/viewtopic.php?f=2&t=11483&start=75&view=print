Would that be the case?  On the flip side, what about developing the core NES engine (for example, that has seamless 8 way scrolling like Gauntlet, or dreaded slope collision), and then using that same engine with each new game?

In old platforms like the NES, versatility equals slowness. Game engines have to be very specific to each game, because you can't waste CPU time on features you're not using. This severely limits the types of games you can make with the same engine and makes the games less unique.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">Alternatively, I had an idea for an NES game making program that is -very basic- and can only produce -very basic- games with a proprietary engine.

Of course, given the limited nature of the NES, this seems more like a waste of time when the game won't be optimized, but the point still stands.</div><br />Sounds like too much trouble for such a small reward. Most games made with game making tools suck balls, because they attract talentless people who can create a game in a couple of days. Sure, a few people who know what they're doing can make great games, but that's rare. The smaller amount of customization allowed by an NES engine will only make this worse.

The Sydney Hunter thing looks like it's also the same engine. I'd assume the Mega Man games didn't rewrite the engine every time. Tokumaru touched on versatility being slow. There's also versatility being large. An extra 2KB of ROM for some engine features you're not using is significant. And while it's possible to write the engine such that you can undefine the parts you aren't using like <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/viewtopic.php?f=6&amp;t=10888" class="postlink">famitone2 has</a>, this is just more work on the engine writer for not much gain. A time vs payoff wall.<br /><br />It's also worth noting there's not necessarily a shortage of engines and source code available. Pretty much everyone still writes their own stuff, for reasons covered. <br /><br />Edit: Also an engine is not a game. I have focused my efforts in this topic on why this is hard for engine reasons, but making a game is hard on its own like rainwarrior said some post ago. Have you made games for any other platform?<br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">Alternatively, I had an idea for an NES game making program that is -very basic- and can only produce -very basic- games with a proprietary engine.

It's not a waste of time because of the limited nature of the NES. A person who would know how to program a compiler could very likely do a stellar job of something like this, in a way that there's barely a performance hit from making a game this way rather than just programming it. But it's another time vs payoff wall. It's a waste of time because (if I were writing it just to aid my own development) I could get the game I wanted help with done before the helper project could put on its pants.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">I guess you're right, but my biggest fear of NES development is the lack of an interface, and how everything must seemingly be done directly to the metal.

I could teach SCORES of people 6502 from scratch.<br /><br />I could start working on the thing right now, and you will be DONE WITH YOUR NES game<strong><em> long before</em></strong> I am finished if you started right now.

There's another member here who got a no scrolling screen changing scheme done in less than a month with NO prior 6502 or NES experience. (Though he was familiar with higher level programming.) What gets in the way of a lot of projects is the person who wants it done thinking about how cool it'd be instead of them just doing it. <br />I guess the general answer to most questions you could ask, is that it's probably possible, sure. I really like it so I'm mentioning this post again (last time in this topic, I promise.). <br /><div class="quotetitle">Mike_Z in <a href="http://skullgirls.com/forums/index.php?threads/big-band-story-mode-discussion-massive-spoilers.2737/page-4#post-96866" class="postlink">this post</a> wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">I mean, as a programmer, the answer is &quot;if we spent enough time making it work it could likely work&quot;, but what &quot;enough time&quot; is and whether it's worth spending that time to make it work is the thing.

A good programmer never says No unless time or cost prohibits doing the thing, because otherwise the answer is Yes.)</div>

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I guess you're right, but I'd be far more inclined to hack existing games to be a little better.  For example, I would like to hack the Chinese Pokemon Yellow bootleg and recreate the first generation of Pokemon games for the NES.  I'd hack the game to use MMC5 (since the GBC's attributes were similar to the MMC5's) and replace the graphics, essentially make a colorized version of the Pokemon games.  If I was more ambitious, I'd even reprogram the battle system and implement some of the features of the newer games.  I have no original creativity, sadly, so learning this would be a waste of effort if I have no ideas.  Hacking and homebrewing are two different beasts.  Unless, of course, I really, REALLY wanted to make a better port of Joe &amp; Mac than Elite Systems managed.<br /><br />As a side note, I would always take anything the Skullgirls people have with something a bit larger than a grain of salt, maybe a whole saltshaker full of salt.  I can't take a game that has become exponentially more popular by a porn animation seriously, especially when said animator has actually been hired as a clean-up artist (and they boasted about it too).  At least it wasn't a certain Nickelodeon pilot.

As <a href="https://allthetropes.orain.org/wiki/Sturgeon%27s_Law" class="postlink">Theodore Sturgeon put it</a>, ninety percent of everything is crap.

Then the programmer would just have to write code for how objects are shaped (like adding custom level objects and modifying them for each column's destruction bit), when objects are spawned, and what happens when they collide. From these primitives, one could create a game like <em>Mario</em> or <em>Mega Man</em> or <em>Castlevania</em> or what have you.

(If you think it's not hard, you're not thinking fully about the problem.) The image formats that make some of that possible have not been reverse engineered, and not for lack of trying. If you happen to respect hackers, you may have heard of <a href="https://twitter.com/dantarion" class="postlink">Dantarion</a>, responsible for figuring out all sorts of neat fighting game formats. And then there's <a href="http://skullgirls.com/forums/index.php?threads/modding-tool-skullmod.1294/page-2#post-72983" class="postlink">this post by Dantarion.</a> Even if you hate the game/think he's a bad game designer, I think his views on programming are worth considering. I'm not saying he's John Carmack, but he's been around the block. It's cool if you disagree, but I'd say that in general dismissing a person based on a single project associated with them (possibly for decisions they didn't make) isn't too cool. You can miss out on a lot of good information this way. I've learned a lot from artists who have worked on sketchy things as well, for what it's worth. I'll happily PM you further on this if you'd like. It's very off topic, but I couldn't say nothing here.<br /><br />I'd also say you'd probably have better luck starting from scratch than hacking that specific Pokemon Yellow. You're talking about replacing the entire game, basically.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Yeah, I noticed that might be an issue (with the game), so I would potentially use my development skills solely to port games over to the NES.  I'm not sure if I'd have the ambition to do it (or modifying the graphics from other consoles, such as the hypothetical Joe &amp; Mac re-conversion), but I reckon I could get some peeps to help along.  I have a good idea of what the NES' graphics are capable of, so I could probably give my colleagues some guidelines as to what the graphics should be like.  But porting games would be possibly illegal, though, which explains why there are so few 'direct ports' of games; Thwaite is adaptation of Missile Command, STREEMERZ is a port of the flash game (with Pondunkian's permission, no less).  I'm not a good game designer, and I feel the NES missed out on a few arcade classics.
