		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I'm very appreciative of devices like this and loopy's FDSstick. I enjoy them both, but I wonder if it's possibly to implement auto-disk swapping like flashcarts do.<br /><br />Now I don't know the low level behind the scenes workings of the FDS and its bios so I guess I can only speculate ways I'd imagine for this to be theoretically possible.<br /><br />1.) Does the RAM adapter send some sort of &quot;hey, I need a different disk side&quot; message to the FDS that FDSemu could intercept and auto-swap the side with an appropriate firmware update?<br /><br />2.) I don't know how the flashcarts do the auto-swap. Do some of them modify the FDS bios for additional functionality? If that is the case, could na eprom or whatever kind of chip is needed be burned with a hacked FDS bios that could be installed in the RAM adapter to added needed features for auto-disk swapping? (I'd assume FDSemu firmware would also need to be updated). I'm unaware if the FDS bios is on its own chip in the RAM adapter, or if it's implemented in one of the custom chips that would make replacing it nearly impossible.<br /><br />If either of these are possible, is there any down side to implementing it? Is there some oddball game that it would break compatibility with?

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Please, no.  Auto disk swapping means, for example, you can't view the intros to Zelda, Doki Doki Panic, and others.  It makes loading actually <em>longer</em> in games that load multiple files in sequence, as they pause for several seconds and show the &quot;SET DISK B&quot; message each time rather than keep a blank screen.  On the Everdrive, at least, Kinnikuman fails to load with the autoswapping feature of the ED.  There are bound to be more.<br /><br />I'd like to keep full control over disk sides, even if it means the occasional total exertion of reaching over to push a button.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I am working with ApolloBoy to sort this out. Each one is tested very well before I ship it. <br /><br />The Windows programs are currently the only ones working properly. The OS X and Linux programs need some more work to properly write disk images to flash. This is known and now that I have many of these assembled and tested and ready to ship I can resume coding on these as well as getting the rest of my code ready for open source and updating my user manual. <br /><br />Having said that, I am offering a New Years special for the entire month of January. They are priced at $40 each but with this exclusive nesdev coupon code you can have $5 off your order, to make it cost you only $35. <br /><br />I am only making the 128mbit version which holds 256 disk sides. <br /><br />The loader has been made internal to the firmware to free up the disk slot that the loader was using. <br /><br />The coupon code for the discount is: nesdev4life<br /><br />Thanks for supporting this and please keep feature requests coming. I am happy to work out any problems you may have. <br /><br />Thanks again,<br /><br />James<br /><br /><a href="http://fdsemu.com/store/" class="postlink">http://fdsemu.com/store/</a>

For some reason, my laptop doesn't flash games to the FDSemu properly and that's why it was throwing up errors every time I tried to load a game.

Probably, some games wait for an unspecified time between disk ejection and insertion, so I expect to encounter some more that are blind to &quot;pseudo-sudden&quot; disk switches.

So firmware/loader updates are bundled together, no more updating just the loader.<br /><br />Also fixed disk writing issue I had overlooked, tested on a 7201 drive and a 3206 drive with my Write Mod board I am selling in the store.

The RAM adapter alone is ~$16 these days on eBay, so I guess that's not so bad.<br /><br />The only other option would be a flash cart like the PowerPak. Are there issues with the fidelity of the FDS implementation in the flash carts?

Apparently they all use BIOS routines for disk access, because they wouldn't work otherwise.<br /><br />Audio isn't 100% correct either.  No reason it can't be, I just didn't have the hardware to compare it to when I worked on it.  I need to go back and fix it sometime...
