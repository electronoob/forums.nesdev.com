For graphics, sound, map etc there are many ways and approaches to the things, it is all up to you. You may use some existing tools, or create your own. You can convert graphics from a picture, or use a tile editor, or type it as a series of HEX values. You can use FamiTracker or MuseTracker with existing players for music, however, many prefer to make everything in this area from scratch, and type music data as HEX values. There are universal map editors, but you'll need a converter tool to use these. There are other ways to create maps as well.

Every game has its own format, it is up to programmer to decide how the data will be stored, so there is no ready made solution.

How do you make one from Scratch?</div><br />Most people just come up with their simple map formats and type hex values directly into the code.<br /><br />There's no consolidated map format because each game's needs are different, so even if a tool will help you with part of the process there will still be a lot to adjust until the maps can be used by your game engine. Most people are not up to coding a lot of tools and scripts to handle these conversions, so they just come up with their own formats that can be easily typed by hand.<br /><br />A full uncompressed screen on the NES is 1KB large, so you obviously can't store maps that way if you plan on having more than a handful of screens. What you do is you start reusing tiles. The first thing most games do is use metatiles instead of tiles: they define a set of blocks that are made from 4 tiles and the maps point to those blocks instead of tiles. This makes screens occupy only 25% of the space an uncompressed screen does! From there, other kinds of compression can be used to further decrease the space each screen takes. You can use RLE or LZ compression on the raw map data, or you can creating screens by placing objects on them (SMB1 does this) rather than defining one block for each space in the grid. Like I said, each game has different requirements.
