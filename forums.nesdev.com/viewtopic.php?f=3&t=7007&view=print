		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />i'm trying to get sound going in my emulator, but i just don't quite understand what the math has to be to generate the waveforms. i have all the registers stuff working, and i even have some sort of super-crappy triangle channel playing sound but i'm not doing it right.
<br />
<br />i've read blargg's and brad taylor's APU docs, both of which have a lot of good info - but, i'm just kind of lost when it comes to doing the math with the values calculated from all the register writes.
<br />
<br />i know each channel gets clocked every (cpuclockrate / channelfreq) cpu ticks, and i need to take a snapshot of all the channels' values every (cpuclockrate / samplerate) cpu ticks.
<br />
<br />the problem is i just am lost when trying to come up with the formulas to modify the values for every channel clock. i feel like am so close on this, but i can't quite figure out what's next.
<br />
<br />here's a 1 MB WAV (44.1 KHz 8-bit mono) of what my triangle channel code is sounding like when i play megaman 1. this is from the stage select screen and then starting fire man's level.
<br />

<br />huge thanks to anybody who can point me in the right direction in getting this all working properly!!

<br />There is no snapshot.* The NES APU period dividers operate continuously based on the CPU clock.
<br />
<br />I listened to the wave file, and then I looked at it in a waveform editor. The first thing I saw was an incorrect waveform. It appears to be as follows:
<br />[ 4 5 6 7 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0 1 2 3 ]
<br />The actual NES triangle waveform is 32 units wide and 15 tall:
<br />[ 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 15 14 13 12 11 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 ]
<br />
<br />But what's causing the more annoying audible artifact is the sharp, temporary transition to and from an incorrect pitch once every 30 milliseconds.

<br />
<br />i actually am using the proper waveform. i think what might be happening is that it's not hitting every byte. this is my code in the 6502 core where it generates the sound..
<br />
<br />(the core itself is neil bradley's, which i got off of zophar.net and then made some modifications so it's more suited to a NES emu with the mappers and stuff.)
<br />
<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">void exec6502&#40;int timerTicks&#41;<br />&#123;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;while &#40;timerTicks &gt; 0&#41;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&#123;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; opcode = read6502&#40;PC++&#41;;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; instruction&#91;opcode&#93;&#40;&#41;;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; clockticks6502 += ticks&#91;opcode&#93;;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; timerTicks -= clockticks6502;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; clockticks6502 = 0;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; totalticks += ticks&#91;opcode&#93;;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; if &#40;triangle_enable!=0 &amp;&amp; &#40;totalticks%triangle_freq&#41;==0&#41; triangle_clock&#40;&#41;;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; if &#40;square1_enable!=0 &amp;&amp; &#40;totalticks%square1_freq&#41;==0&#41; square1_clock&#40;&#41;;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; if &#40;&#40;totalticks%&#40;cpuclock/samplerate&#41;&#41;==0&#41; &#123;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;cursample = &#40;&#40;&#40;trianglesample-8&#41;+&#40;square1sample-8&#41;&#41;/2&#41;&lt;&lt;1;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;putinbuf&#40;&#41;;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &#125;<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; if &#40;&#40;totalticks%&#40;cpuclock/240&#41;&#41;==0 &amp;&amp; doaudio==1&#41; APU_frame_seq_tick&#40;&#41;;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&#125;<br />&#125;</div>
<br />
<br />the square1 stuff doesn't generate anything yet. i know the mixing is horribly incorrect, but i just put that together to see what it was sounding like so far with just the triangle.
<br />
<br />anyway, it looks like it might be skipping data from my triangle enum because it's usually not going to land on exactly the right totalticks value to modulo with triangle_freq to equal zero now that i look again. i suppose i'll need to test for a range.
<br />
<br />what i'm really confused about though is how to go about generating the waveform for the square/pulse channels. the noise channel and DMC are simple enough.
<br />
<br />what's involved mathematically speaking for generating the envelope, etc?

<br />If you want efficient, this is the most: { } I think it's best to get it correct first, then worry about efficiency. As in, don't even think about efficiency until you have something working that's easy to work with.
<br />
<br />Your original one fails because it doesn't run the waves if the instruction beginning doesn't happen to fall on the exact clock the waves run. You need it to run them however many times they ticked since the last instruction.
<br />
<br />I highly recommend taking a look at my <a href="http://code.google.com/p/blip-buf/" class="postlink">blip_buf</a> library, particularly <a href="https://blip-buf.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/demo_chip.c" class="postlink">demo_chip.c</a>. It lets you work in terms of the waveform at the full CPU clock rate, and handles everything else to get you the samples you can play on the PC. You are still generating the waveforms, so it's not taking your work away from you, just allowing you to code the actual NES stuff, rather than the fairly involved and easy to make a mess of resampling for the PC.

<br />i've got the triangle and both squares going now, have a look at a minute and a half from megaman: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=My0krmH9frU">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=My0krmH9frU</a><!-- m -->
<br />
<br />far from perfect but now i'm really understanding how it works. i have to clean up the clicks and add the timer &gt;= 8 check, as well as add noise/DMC plus sweeps for the squares but it's definitely starting to sound kinda like a NES.
