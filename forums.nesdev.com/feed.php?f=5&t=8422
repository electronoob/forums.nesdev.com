First, it's been a while that I could post around here since I have been very busy with my new job in the south of Japan.  I will have a small rant on the subject since I had to work many hours on the android platform and it seems some people seems to think that because it's "open", everything is cool.<br /><br />second, I want to mention that I'm an "iHater" by heart, but with all the exposure to android programming (especially with bitmap based application), I may have a change of heart. I hate the closed environment but programming for the platform seems less an headache to me now.  <br /><br />Because it's open doesn't mean that it will always be better.  I was thinking that way but it doesn't seems to be the case.  You would think that because it run linux that all of those phone would run on linux, right? Wrong. Some vendor still do windows only drivers for a system that uses linux! And even when they support windows, you're not even sure that it will run on a 64 bit EVEN when they provide the 64 bits drivers.<br /><br />Phone from 1 year ago are already in the past even though the hardware is still good enough.  Then you have the "open" thing. Because it's open, there is many different OS, many variance of UI, many different screen size, many things that should work that are standard but that don't because the maker didn't take the time to implement it properly etc.. Basically, we are back to the nightmare of working on the PC or older cellphones. <br /><br />Then the sluggishness... It's awful. Even with a dual core some of those phone cannot run similar to an old 3GS!  DUAL CORE!  And now don't get me on the subject of real time audio... Loading a file can get you a lag of 200/300 millisecond, which is not acceptable when you try to sync stuff.<br /><br />Basically, the OS was never made to do things like the iPhone, it was targeting to fight against black berry and changed when the iPhone came.  If they can fix their graphic and audio subsystem, it will get better but 4.0.1 is still not doing so. <br /><br />So before saying the platform is so great I would suggest you first to try to develop an application professionally and you may have a change of heart, or not if you like torture.  I really liked android but now.. I don't know.<br /><br />Back to the original question, it depends what you do with it. It's a small computer on the go so it's basically for light stuff like mail, web etc. If you need more than that, it will end up in the closet, like it did for many people.<br /><br />Again, I don't own any iDevice except for a very old iPod video from 6 years ago but that android platform is starting to get on my nerve.<br /><br />p.s. I couldn't touch a computer at home for more than a month 1/2 because of that #$$" android programming.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3559">Banshaku</a> — Tue Dec 20, 2011 5:13 pm</p><hr />

Wow <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /> Thanks for the comments. Anyway, here's a good question: how would you use it? Take my Nokia N8 as an example of gadget. I chose it because of my needs, not only for phone calls, but pictures of 12mp and movies in HD, plus its awesome quality (yeah). It plays music too, awesome.<br /><br />Now, a tablet. It's not the same for taking pictures in a public area... <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /> and, well, its size is a problem for working outside. By the way, an advanced cellphone has the same price of a tablet here. Go figure.<br /><br />So, in short words, an iPad would be my "giant cellphone". Some of you were chatting about creating programs for it... well, it's interesting, but I believe that a PC is the platform for programming.<br /><br />About the PC now: well, I noticed that the screen of a laptop within Full HD support is MUCH better than the "standard" 720p screens. With an powerful gfx board on it (GeForce), I *could* play games, since my current laptop has no power for it. <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" alt=":(" title="Sad" /><p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=39">Zepper</a> — Mon Dec 19, 2011 5:53 am</p><hr />

Well then, I thought you were supposed to learn to use tools. A computer is a tool, just so happens to be a very complex one if you don't look into how it works, what a file is, etc. You learn to use it or you shouldn't be able to use it honestly. Sorry, but that's the whole "using it properly" thing works.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=4311">3gengames</a> — Sun Dec 18, 2011 9:20 pm</p><hr />

Why would anyone develop for an emulator only? I can think of several reasons, from general intellectual interest (e.g. 'I want to see what Objective-C is like) to experimenting with a platform. I've dipped into Intellivision and Vectrex dev simply to see what the tools are like. <br /><br />The consumption vs. creation criticism comes up a lot with the iPad. I don't see that there's anything inherently wrong with using a device for consumption alone. Plenty of people get by OK in life consuming movies, TV, music, books, and even culinary delicacies without creating them. Not everyone has that desire. However, the claim that people either can't or don't create with the iPad is wildly erroneous. There's an amazing range of audio/synthesis tools, word processors, video and photo editing suites, and so on. And the more people own them, the truer this will be.<br /><br />I'm sure this conversation can go back and forth forever. I hope no one thinks I'm trying to convince them Apple is superior (which would never work) - simply that  Apple products are fine machines to get work done with.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=2462">noattack</a> — Sun Dec 18, 2011 9:04 pm</p><hr />

Tepples, I think you propose a much more reasonable set of disadvantages, though there's still a few points I'd say are worth noting.<br /><br />Nintendo is a weirder corporate case than most in terms of the 'renewable security' issues, as they aren't as prone to patching (as you mention with the Wii). This is reflected in their online strategy in general, but I think both Sony and Microsoft are more consistently 'moving targets' in comparison to any Nintendo console. Both PSP and PS3 hackers/developers play cat-and-mouse with Sony's firmware revisions. <br /><br />Nonetheless, I think it's odd to compare a near 30 year old platform that's slipped out of patent and commercial viability against a current, active platform like iOS. It's better to compare, say, 1987 Nintendo vs. 2011 Apple. <br /><br />It's free to gather the tools and code for an NES emulator, but there are still associated costs with running code on real hardware. A Powerpak, building your own dev board, hell <em>just owning an NES</em> is only free if you already have them or the tools to build them. In that light, iOS dev could also be 'free' if you already have some of the base 'tools,' i.e. a Mac. If you do, you can download XCode and the iOS SDK for free and run them on the iPhone/iPad simulator. The dev membership comes into play when you want to run on real hardware and/or be included in the store.<br /><br />The point is, there are associated development costs with <em>any</em> platform if you start from scratch. <br /><br />I'd actually argue that the iPad is <em>more</em> of a general-purpose computer, keeping in mind that the general public doesn't care if they have to deal with file systems, manual saves, etc. They just want the damn thing to check email, browse the web, watch videos, and so on. They just want the computer to work. <br /><br />We have to keep in mind that most users aren't like us. Even I, a web developer and hobbyist programmer, am amazed at the depth of knowledge and technical skill within this community.<br /><br />That's why I keep quiet most of the time and just read.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=2462">noattack</a> — Sun Dec 18, 2011 5:04 pm</p><hr />

<div class="quotetitle">noattack wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"><br />I also hope everyone sees the irony of criticizing Apple for being a closed platform when we all develop for a platform controlled by Nintendo<br /></div><br />True, NESdev relies on a jailbreak (or rather a cloned key). But there are several issues in play here, some of them being renewable security (the ability of the manufacturer to fix defects allowing unauthorized jailbreaks), the cost of tools, the cost of an authorized jailbreak, and whether everyone obtaining a copy of the program likewise needs a jailbreak. I'll sort these into broad categories by any required annual fee for a durable jailbreak.<br /><br /><strong>No annual fee</strong><br /><br />The NES and for that matter every single other Nintendo consumer platform up through the DS Lite lack renewable security: break once, break everywhere for all time. The developer tools are affordable; the software is free and Free, and the hardware options include a modded cart board + EPROM programmer, a ReproPak kit with sockets + EPROM programmer, a PowerPak, or the forthcoming 8T-ROM. And the jailbreak is simple: cut pin 4 to create a lockless circuit. Furthermore, after the expiration of the CIC patent, <a href="http://www.retrousb.com/product_info.php?cPath=24&amp;products_id=37" class="postlink">cheap cloned keys</a> let end users' systems run "unlicensed" games.<br /><br />Android has soft security: the end user can turn installation of self-signed packages on or off, and all phones with Android Market have adb install. The tools are likewise free and Free, as I understand it. Numerous alternative markets have sprung up (AppsLib, Amazon, SlideME, Soc.io).<br /><br />Windows Phone 7 has renewable security, but the ChevronWP7 official jailbreak is $9 per device for life. As for the cost of the tools, there is price competition in the market for PCs capable of running Windows Phone SDK. The WP7 devices themselves are very expensive and not yet marketed for use with prepaid cellular service. I don't own a WP7 device and thus lack any sense of whether there's an audience for apps requiring ChevronWP7.<br /><br />Some might argue that because Wii Menu 4.3 has gone so long without an upgrade, and because the architecture of Nintendo IOS doesn't allow fixing game bugs like that used by Smash Stack, Wii falls into this category as well. The homebrew tools are free and Free, and the jailbreak is a best-selling Wii game. The problem here is that Wii homebrew community tends to frown on charging for anything.<br /><br /><strong>Annual fee</strong><br /><br />Apple iOS has a $99 per year fee for running programs obtained other than through the App Store. The developer tools are free with the purchase of a $600 dongle, which can usually work through one or two new versions of Mac OS X.<br /><br />The Xbox Live Indie Games environment is based on XNA, just like games for WP7. But it has no counterpart to ChevronWP7 and thus requires the $99 per year App Hub subscription. As with WP7, there is price competition in the market for machines that can run XNA Game Studio. And as with WP7, only programming languages that can be compiled to verifiably type-safe IL will work.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"><br />And now I'm curious, Bregalad, about what your definition of a computer is (and how, presumably, the Mac is somehow less of one?).<br /></div><br />In my opinion, which may not match that of Bregalad, the Mac is a fine computer. It's just the iPad that's not really a general-purpose computer because Apple bans some specific purposes.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=9">tepples</a> — Sun Dec 18, 2011 3:09 pm</p><hr />

No, Apple's PC market share is still under 10%. Isolating laptops changes the percentage considerably, but overall (business, server, PC, and so on), their market share is still comparatively low.<br /><br />I also hope everyone sees the irony of criticizing Apple for being a closed platform when we all develop for a platform controlled by Nintendo, who notoriously regulated all aspects of the NES, from manufacturing to content. Videogame consoles in general are the shining example of closed platforms (though that's changed a bit this generation), for better and worse.<br /><br />And now I'm curious, Bregalad, about what your definition of a computer is (and how, presumably, the Mac is somehow less of one?).<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=2462">noattack</a> — Sun Dec 18, 2011 1:59 pm</p><hr />

<div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"><br />Plus when you write programs for it, they reach 5% of people and piss off the 95%<br /></div><br />This was right some 4 years ago.<br />Nowdays its more like 95% of people have macs and only 5% still have PCs (at least in my area). Everyone made "the change" all for the wrong reasons, and because they have no clue what a computer is in the first place.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=38">Bregalad</a> — Sun Dec 18, 2011 10:04 am</p><hr />

Microsoft is interested in maximizing profits and sales, like any corporation. They're not in the market for charity. I don't understand your point about version numbers (the sentence isn't clear), so I can't really reply.<br /><br />You're comparing two different platforms. Windows is the dominant PC OS, but others were talking about developing for iOS, the dominant tablet OS and a fairly even split with Android in the mobile space. Just because something is standard now doesn't mean it will be in the future (see Flash vs. HTML/CSS/JS) and the future tends to look PC-less, for lack of a better term. That doesn't mean ALL PCs will disappear, just that most people won't need them for everyday uses. The NESDev community is an edge-case, consisting of users with niche computing needs, so it's understandable that this scenario may not be appealing.<br /><br />Yes, some consumers may buy products from a company because they're cool. But dismissing an entire market (tens of millions) as sheep is misguided at best. All companies have their blind evangelists (even Microsoft). Many people buy Apple products because they LIKE them. It's crazy, I know.<br /><br />Number 3 is silly. If no Mac software is better than Windows, why would it 'piss off the 95%'? How could you even make such a blanket claim? Have you tried all software for both platforms? And I'm sure the Mac developers that make a living from their software wouldn't appreciate being called stupid. And if your guiding development principle is market share, why use Ubuntu development as an advantage? If you're a developer looking to make money right now, it'd be dumb to ignore iOS, period. That may change in the future, but for now, that's fact. <br /><br />I don't see why these discussions always devolve into all-or-nothing dismissals of the opposing 'team'? I would never call Windows developers sheep or stupid because of their chosen platform. People choose the tools appropriate to their interests, needs, aesthetic preferences, desires, etc.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=2462">noattack</a> — Sun Dec 18, 2011 9:58 am</p><hr />
