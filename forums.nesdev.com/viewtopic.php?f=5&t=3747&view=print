<br />Take the first letter of each word and you get Q+U+I+E+T+U+S+T. Then again, if you take the last letter of the first word, the first letter of the third word, the fourth letter of the third word and the ninth letter of the fourth word, you get T+I+T+S. So I don't know, hmm... <img src="./images/smilies/icon_lol.gif" alt=":lol:" title="Laughing" />
<br />
<br />Coincidence? I don't think so. Government conspiracy? You betcha. Something involving Area 51, no doubt. And the Greys. Let's not forget about the Greys. And let's not forget about the time they abducted me, took me aboard their big spaceship, and performed all kinds of horrible and unnecessary experiments on me. Sorry! I do tend to ramble...

<br />Big difference between the Greys and The Jetsons dude. I couldn't get them mixed up, even for a second. A couple of weeks with The Jetsons? Sounds delightful vs. those three months with the Greys. Anyway, let's not let my fictional encounter with a non-existent race of extraterrestrial life forms get in the way of what's important here.
<br />
<br />NotTheCommonDose, your attention please. What's the meaning behind your signature? Is the whole Quietust thing just a coincidence? Or are the Greys really back for another gang probing of my rectal passage?
<br />
<br />*Shudders*
<br />
<br />P.S. Who is that Avatar picture of?

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />* If you pick really randome letters the subliminal message is definitely impossible to decode. So I guess a true subliminal message should either read as the first letter of each word, the last letter of each word, one of the two preceding things backwards, possibly the first letter of one word out of two or something. I also saw texts that completely change meaning if one line out of two is ommited, however, this should be TOO hard to do.
<br />
<br />* Why should sublmimal messages always be negative ? Why noone come up with a text that reads as "godd bless you" or something positive ?
<br />
<br />* I also remember that Snake Rattle 'n' Roll (NES) has a part of a level that have the letters "GAMEBOY" hidden in it (very big letters that make platforms).
<br />
<br />EDIT : Quietust (the real one) in fact seems to have done something on the Wiki pretty much recently.

<br />
<br />It's the family-friendly sample of "We're gonna burn your building down you fuckheads, C17 is watching you, you communist, nigger-loving paki cunts".  Turns out it was originally a phone call on some album and goes on to say something like "we're gonna hang you for burning the British flag".
<br />
<br />I remember playing some game that seemed to have some kind of subliminal thing going on.  It was some vertical-scrolling helicopter shooting game, I don't know what.  It was doing beeps in weird patterns with the triangle channel that sounded similar to those programs people have made that are supposed to alter your state of consciousness.  If not, what a great idea. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" />
