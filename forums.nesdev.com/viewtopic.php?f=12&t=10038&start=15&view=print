		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Well, technically it is possible to make ping-pong looping for compressed audio. I even wrote a backwards player for AAC/OGG/MP3 years ago, just decode a frame and play it in needed direction. 16 sample buffers per channel wouldn't take too much resources on a DSP probably. But we have that we have, so no ping-pong on the SNES audio hardware, and it is kind of limitation, especially when converting from existing XM/IT, as it widely used there. Sure not the most serious limitation in this area, though.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />You are correct that backwards playing a BRR sample could be possible, but it would need much more hardware resources. I think the SDSP decodes 4 samples at a time, if backwards playing would have to be done, then an entiere block (16 samples) would have to be decoded at a time.<br /><br />Not only that, but the start adress of the sample would have to be constantly compared to the entry in the sample table (since there is no bit for loop start block in the BRR encoding).<br /><br />Finally the limitation of the SPC is not the absence of ping-pong looping (which can be easily emulated with a longer sample), but effectively the lack of memory for long, high quality samples.<br /><br />You can thank god Nintendo finally decided to use 64kb of RAM. Supposedly, it was intended to have only 32 kb ! However I think 128kb would have been better. 64 kb for samples and 64kb for program + variables + echo buffer would have been a nice idea.<br />Anyways we're not redoing the SNES hardware <img src="./images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" alt=":(" title="Sad" />

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Actually it is circulated in old docs around that SPC only has 32K. Don't know where it came from, probably because there are 32K chips on the board. The memory map in the official docs is also introduces some confusion, it shows 512kbit total, but only shows up $0000-$7fff on the graph and does not explain what is in the $8000-$ffbf. Still, that's a minor confusion compared to what I've heard recently in a SNES hardware review, that the IPL takes 64K. That was fun.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I take my conversions very carefully: I do sample chopping and quality reduction right off the bat. Without any actual note data (and practically the entire RAM for sample data), the SPC700 can take around 100,000 samples.<br /><br />Another one that I think of is sample offset. That should be possible as long as you allocate a sample in the table for your offset data per channel.<br /><br />I also can't help but think of a possible psuedo-synth mode that would take a set of small samples and would have a dynamically altered loop point (this would use the timer quite well, although remember that your code must manually check for it). This only works properly for the smaller samples (I'd say 1-8 blocks), and the lower the pitch, the more possibility that you might accidentally skip a step (unless you use more blocks to offset this problem).
