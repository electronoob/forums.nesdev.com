If you talk about implementing a UI (i.e. you already know what you want), it's mostly grunt work. If you also have to design the UI, it's not easy, but at the same time it's also not a fun type of a challenge, at least for me.

And is it trolling or assessing? Besides, both Wine and FCEUX are free. A 32-bit program with source code available under a free software license is still free software.<br /><br />On the other hand, Canonical seems about to prove calima right. Recently announced plans imply that Ubuntu is phasing out i686 (Pentium Pro, Pentium II, and newer 32-bit) support. (From <a href="https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/ubuntu-devel/2016-June/039420.html" class="postlink">ubuntu-devel</a>, via <a href="https://soylentnews.org/article.pl?sid=16/07/05/1519241" class="postlink">SoylentNews</a>) As I understand the discussion, the consensus is as follows:<br /><br /><ul><li>Ubuntu 16.10 and later will not have a 32-bit install disc but can be reached through net install or upgrading from Ubuntu 16.04.</li><li>Ubuntu 18.10 and later will not have a 32-bit kernel or 32-bit libraries in the repository. All 32-bit applications, including Wine, will have to run in a container, as calima alluded with the &quot;32-bit chroot&quot;. </li></ul><br />This would leave 18.04, to be released in about two years, as the last version of Ubuntu where Wine is useful. Wine users may have to jump ship to another distro.

A program running in 64-bit mode is going to compile into a program that uses much more RAM, because there's longer instructions, as all pointers and some variables will take more space.

Wine providing a 32-bit VM is not as farfetched as it sounds.<br /><br />There's a much bigger issue (OK, hypothetical for now, but...). UEFI can parse the filesystem and load the kernel for you, with the CPU already in the correct mode. Once UEFI becomes ubiquitous enough that we can just assume it's always there (and we're only a few years away from that), what are the chances that new x64 processors will just drop the legacy modes, leaving only long mode (64-bit)? I don't know how the boot process would be, but only UEFI would have to care anyway. On the other hand, it'd help simply the CPU cores, which is a big deal given how absurdly complex the architecture is already. There's a good reason to expect 32-bit x86 programs to stop working because CPUs won't support them anymore (short of emulating them).<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">Bregalad wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">This has to be the biggest oxymoron i've ever seen.

And don't forget that long mode provides double the amount of registers which makes it much easier to optimize programs, not to mention that because the integer registers now are 64-bit it's a lot more reasonable to do 64-bit calculations (even if you still prefer 32-bit or less for <em>storing</em> most data, calculation is a whole different can of worms if part of an expression can generate large values, as happens with multiplication). Also there are enough XMM registers to fit two whole 4×4 matrices into them (and yes, this matters during matrix multiplication - and no, you aren't going to be doing all of them on the GPU, usually the GPU handles the per-vertex ones but not the per-mesh ones).<br /><br />Morever, protected mode has lots of bullshit stuff honestly. Long mode is a big clean up, 64-bit support is the lesser of its advantages in practice.

Intel removed a few things of dubious utility on the transition from 8086 -&gt; 80186 (e.g. POP CS), and a few more things on the transition from x86 to x86_64 (e.g. BOUND), but I don't think the wholesale removal of this functionality is probable.<br /><br />I mean, on Intel's x86_64 cores you can still switch from 64-bit to 32-bit to a 16-bit vm86. (AMD deprecated the vm86, but Intel still has it)

Canonical wants to entirely relegate 32-bit support in Ubuntu Desktop and Ubuntu Server to containers rather than the main repository within the next few years. Some of the endorsed but not fully Canonical-supported remixes, especially Xubuntu and Lubuntu, may retain 32-bit support longer, as their explicit goal includes repurposing PC hardware that can no longer run modern Windows well. And Xubuntu has never had the shopping lens crap.
