<br />
<br />That's true, y'know. A sasquatch lives at the end of my garden and he's always using the lavatory without asking, and he NEVER flushes, either. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_lol.gif" alt=":lol:" title="Laughing" /> 
<br />
<br />So what do we do now? If he can't release a ROM for us to try, the there is no way for us to authenticate it. We can only sit here and call him a fraud and wait until he admits it.

Then the others would ask lots of technical quesitons, and ask for proofs and so on. For each pictures that looks authentic or for each technical info that seems reasonabe, you would get some amount of point. And at the end, when others can have enough proofs that your project is fake, then your total points are set. And the one with most total points gets a price ! Doesn't that sound exciting ?
<br />
<br />Of course, <em>evildragon</em> would be the arbiter since he cannot participate in the contest (he cheats all the way) and he have the most experience in the domain.

<br />He's not that much idiot : For this very reason he invented that DVD-drive stuff, so his thing is not supposed to run in a ROM.
<br />Still, his project is still much more credible than the fake FFX NES I mentionned above (that doesn't mean it's credible). The guy said some stuff that could be real and has technical knownledge here and there.
<br />And actually most game collectors have much more of what I call "fake technical knownledge" wich are their own interpretation of completely deformed technical facts.

<br />I don't know, it's way too easy to make a completely plausible and technically correct, but not-actually-in-the-works project.
<br />Or would this contest be more geared towards Zelda 3 prototype games?

<br />Well, they <em>do</em> have the same trick of taking their screenshots focused entirely on the TV (and usually in a darkened room) so you can't see what's hooked up to the TV...hint: certain PowerMac video cards have composite video jacks...

<br />But on a lot of TV output cards, you can't turn off underscan. If you see what looks like a border around the edges of the screen, you're looking at a PC output, which is either an emulator or a complete fake.

<br />If you use an isometric engine like that of <em>Snake Rattle 'n' Roll</em> or <em>Super Mario RPG</em>, something like SM64 on 2D systems might be doable.
