Today, I have been working on.. the title screen.<br /><br />What do you think?

Nintendo's rule was to keep important text out of the top and bottom 24 pixels and the left and right 16 pixels. I follow a looser rule inspired by both my own measurements of SDTVs and the scaled mode of the PocketNES emulator: keep text out of the top 16, bottom 12, and side 8. The red tinted areas are thus the most likely to be cut off.<br /><div class="attachtitle">Attachment:</div><div class="attachcontent">

I've managed to get my ludum dare engine ported over to an unrom with chr-ram, and the basics of a new level loading structure in place using Sumez's excellent level editing tool, however I am having trouble updating chr-ram tiles when in play.<br /><br />I was hoping to flash over a lava tile with two alternating tiles, for instance, but I think the problem is that I don't have enough time in vblank to do so. <br /><br />Has anyone managed this successfully (updating a tile in chr-ram with the screen on)? I'm not using any tile compression, and the loading to the PPU starts right after the flag is given for vblank

This is equivalent to eight to ten tiles. <em>Haunted: Halloween '85</em> and its sequel <em>The Curse of Possum Hollow</em> sling tiles all over the place, dynamically loading both background and sprite tiles needed for the next part of the level. The background tiles and maps in both games and the sprite tiles in the second game are compressed.<br /><br />I took the liberty of rearranging your title screen to fit all important parts in the center 224x192 pixels, following the title safe area guideline implicit in Nintendo's background planning sheets.

If my assumption is right he should &quot;pop&quot; up only when he reaches the peak of his jumping arch, and it might be less jarring to see (but still forgivable if the player missed the platform by a couple of pixels)
