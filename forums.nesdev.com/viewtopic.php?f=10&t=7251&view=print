<br />Is there a reason for this or was it a feature that was just didn't get programmed in?

<br />
<br />That worked like a charm, although in this situation I was using labels and not simply LDA $40 but either way, putting a &lt; in front of the address like &lt;$40 or &lt;Label makes the compiler use zero-page.
<br />
<br />I find it odd that something like that isn't there by default. I mean it isn't all that hard to check if an address is zero-page. I don't suppose NESASM3 is open-source?

<br />ASM6 will use ZP addressing whenever possible... If you don't want to use ZP addressing, you have to enter the instruction manually or use a mirror. On the NES you can just add $800 to the address, since $0800-$08FF is a mirror of $0000-$00FF.

<br />
<br />The version number went from v2.51 to v3.01, despite that it only seems to be a bugfix for a single bug (a really bad one though).
<br />
<br />It's definitely recommended to use ASM6.  Especially if you want to release any source codes.  NESASM usually works, but is pretty weird as far as assemblers go.  I especially never liked ones that require more verbose sources for mundane tasks like that (TASM, WLA-DX are a couple others).

<br />The only situation I can think of is Self Modifying code, or crazy situations where you are intentionally executing a garbage instruction to avoid a branch.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Yup, timed code. Using Absolute addressing instead of ZP is the simplest way to waste a single cycle. There might not be much need for that on the NES, but on the Atari 2600 there surely is.
<br />
<br />I do have some timed code in my current NES project (because of my NMI handler, which always takes the same amount of time regardless of the tasks it performs), but I don't think I had to use this particular trick.

The 6502 doesn't have an indirect mode that's not indexed (the 65C02 does, though), so LDA [$XX] should not be a valid instruction. If that's working for you, that's probably just NEASM being weird again. The correct way to use ZP addressing in NESASM is by using "&lt;" before the variable/address.

<br />Wait a minute! Do you use [] or ()? If you are using parenthesis (which NESASM doesn't use for indirection, unlike all other 6502 assemblers), then it's probably generating absolute addressing instructions. For the program logic it makes no difference, so you can't tell unless you look at the binary. LDA $0000 works exactly the same as LDA $00, it just takes longer.

<br />
<br />LDA makes $AD 0000, LDA [$00] makes $B200 (Says UNDEFINED and then BRK instructions), LDA ($00) makes $AD 0000,  LDA [$00],Y makes $B1 00, LDA ($00),Y makes $B9 0000. And for some reason, when the debugger for FCEUXD look at the LDA ($00),Y it says @ $0000,Y and says it's pointing to location $0000. &gt;.&lt;
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />I need to make a better test, but that doesn't seem right. :/ I've used ZP though, and it worked. I used [$##]. It even worked on hardware. 0_0
