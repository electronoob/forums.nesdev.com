	<tr>
		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I've been updating my game's homebrew page rather frequently, and I've left the "current status" entries in there almost like a news page from a website. Is that excessive do you think or should I trim it down to just "the current status" and not keep all that history in there?

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />A wiki is not a blog, it's a place to store information in a manner that's easy to search. Finding something in those paragraphs of miscellaneous updates can be frustrating, and some of that information is irrelevant IMO (like promises of when you are going to put certain features in).
<br />
<br />I suggest you create actual sections in that page, such as "features", "weapons", "characters", "levels", "items" that you can update whenever you add new stuff, instead of loosely mentioning it in a paragraph with other unrelated information.
<br />
<br />You can also make sections called "Interesting facts" or something similar to include miscellaneous information that doesn't really belong to the more specific sections.
<br />
<br />If you do that, by the time you complete the game you'll have a decent documentation of what it is, something that won't happen if you keep using the wiki as a blog.

<br />I agree with the comments here, but at the same time would love to read a development blog for your game and follow the progress.  Have you thought about starting a Nesdev blog?

<br />
<br />I had considered it at one point. Maybe I should have been doing that all along. Perhaps I'll give it another chance.
