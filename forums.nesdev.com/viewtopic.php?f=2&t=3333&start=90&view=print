<br />i got ADHD, autism, asthma, allergies..  i got the worst of life..  (well, not the worst..  there's people out there that got it pretty bad)
<br />
<br />i actually hate labels.  i think doctors just like calling people autistic, just because they ran out of things to say...
<br />
<br />i mean, isn't that what makes us all unique?

<br />for me, it's the fact that i can learn one thing, but not the other..  seriously, that's how they labeled me..  for example, i can learn a programming language, and learn how to use AV editing software, but when it comes to english and math, i suck...  (so when programming, i always have a programmers calculator handy)

<br />The other way around, NES graphics overlaid on VHS video -- but the required hardware isn't inside of the regular NES.

<br />
<br />(though that circuit won't give you NES graphics....)
<br />
<br />it could be done, but i don't think you'll get very advanced with it..  without a doubt however, you'll need to mix the video outside the NES...

It's definitely not something made in Photoshop, as the signature artifacts of that video chip aren't easy to fake. The unfinished blue scanline at the bottom points to video capture.

<br />I was gonna say it was hardware because of the garbage pixels in the bottom border where the game is writing to CRAM and thus you get classic "snow" at those points, which doesn't happen on any emulator.

<br />It happens on at least one NES emulator I know of. Or has nobody tried to make a Genesis emulator whose VDP accuracy approaches Nintendulator's PPU accuracy?
