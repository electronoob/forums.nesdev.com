<br />
<br />Anyway:
<br />
<br />When in 8k mode ($8000.4 clear), reg $A000 controls the 8k page swapped in at ppu$0000 (ignore the low bit in this mode -- ie, the value right shift 1 is the actual 8k page number)
<br />
<br />When in 4k mode ($8000.4 set), reg $A000 controls the 4k page swapped in at ppu$0000, and reg $C000 controls the 4k page swapped in at ppu$1000

<br />
<br />Changing the mode simply changes how the CHR regs are applied.  The behavior can be inferred from the page on the wiki.
<br />
<br />Remember that no actual "swap" takes place... it's just the mapper replacing the high address bits with an internal register.  The order the regs are written does not matter in the end... ultimately, it comes down to the contents of the registers.
<br />
<br />At ANY time bit 4 of reg 0 is clear, reg 1 is used as the 8k page number, and at any time bit 4 of reg 0 is set, regs 1 and 2 will be used as the 4k page number.
<br />
<br />
<br />In an emulator, if you use a "swap" style approach, you <em>will</em> have to reswap everything on a reg 0 write if the mode changes.  Many emus do this by having a "sync" function:
<br />
<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">void Sync&#40;&#41;<br />&#123;<br />&nbsp; if&#40;reg0 &amp; 0x10&#41;&nbsp; &nbsp;// 4k mode<br />&nbsp; &#123;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; SwapCHR_4k&#40;0x0000,reg1&#41;;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; SwapCHR_4k&#40;0x1000,reg2&#41;;<br />&nbsp; &#125;<br />&nbsp; else&nbsp; &nbsp; // 8k mode<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; SwapCHR_8k&#40;0x0000,reg1 &gt;&gt; 1&#41;;<br />&#125;<br /></div>
<br />
<br />Then all Sync on every related reg write (in this case, regs 0-2)
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />Many mappers operate this way (MMC3 and MMC5 included).  Mode changes often have an immediate effect and will need to have things reswapped using the contents of each register.

<br />What did you do? Metroid looks fine until I start the actual game then everything is filled with a single tile.
<br />
<br />I still don't exactly understand what happens when CHR selecting occurs if CHR-RAM is used.
<br />
<br />thanks

<br />Unless you're trying to run an emulator on a machine with less RAM than the ROM that you're trying to run. Then you have to load the ROM as a swap file. But I'm glad that Dwedit managed to get so much of the NES library playable in PocketNES on the GBA Movie Player.

<br />
<br />The same thing.  Just instead of ROM, it's RAM.
<br />
<br />Most MMC1 games with CHR-RAM will just throw the mapper into 8k mode, and maybe write 0 to the CHR regs once at startup, then just leave it like that forever.
<br />
<br />
<br />Some games for other mappers (notably:  Lagrange Point)  will actually require that you have CHR-RAM selectable just as if it were CHR-ROM

<br />in ff its like in metroid when you have selected your names and the game is about to start, this happens.

<br />I can see that bit4 of register 3 is written to, actually I dont exactly understand what it is, is it important for these games?

<br />
<br />On the actual note:
<br />
<br />I don't really see how this could be a CHR problem -- something else seems to be going terribly wrong here.  Metroid shows doors (which appear to be sprites) on both the left and right sides of the screen ... when in fact there are NO doors at that point in the game.  So the game is drawing doors when it shouldn't be... which is a big red flag saying "hey, the game code isn't executing properly"
<br />
<br />
<br />Have you passed the nestest ROM and/or the CPU portion of NEStress?
<br />
<br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">I can see that bit4 of register 3 is written to, actually I dont exactly understand what it is, is it important for these games?</div>
<br />
<br />I don't think bit 4 of reg 3 is <em>EVER</em> set in Metroid or Final Fantasy.
<br />
<br />Sounding more and more like a CPU bug.
<br />
<br />What it does, though, is when set, it will make the cartridge RAM at $6000-7FFF inaccessable.  If set and the game tries to write there, the writes will do nothing ... and reads will get open bus.
