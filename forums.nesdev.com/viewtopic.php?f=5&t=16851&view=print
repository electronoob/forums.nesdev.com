The only things I've added was a lava dragon who doesn't even have collision, some slightly glitchy wooden crates, and an unfinished wolf boss that moves almost exactly the same way as the &quot;plasma grinch&quot; but with a different body.<br /><br />I've been working on this almost every day, and I feel very frustrated because it's just so unfinished.

Some of these look really situational; (impact freeze enable?) could you also use less bytes by having multipurpose variables? Or is there actually an object (probably the player) that will potentially use all of these at the same time? One of the first things that stuck out to me is that you're using 4 bytes for x and y position. Could you not get away with 3?

Maybe I can use that &quot;lda ($xx,s),y&quot; opcode that doesn't get used very often.

Then one is not quite as dependent on those youthful marathon spurts of activity. They'll still happen, just not as often. And, I'd say for large homebrew projects, it is good to resign oneself to the length of a project---it's gonna be several years if not more. Accept that, and develop a routine, and you will complete your projects.<br /><a href="https://youtu.be/YFeIRVueNRM?t=2m13s" class="postlink">Jordan B. Peterson on having a routine</a> (for life in general, but...really think it applies just as well to a hobby like this)<br />*edit* I'd add to that, for my own routine working on projects, I make sure not to work on it absolutely every day, there are frequent breaks. Gotta avoid burnout. I've been working on my projects 3 evenings a week 100% consistently since late 2008, with the only exceptions being particularly busy times surrounding holidays, family or vacation.
