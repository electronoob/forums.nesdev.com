<br />There are different versions of the boards (you'll probably see CNROM-02, CNROM-03 etc.) but they should function the same.

I just couldn't get it to function. Finally I cut off the LS161 section with the capacitor and resistor and grafted it on to a N-ROM cartridge. Then I took the PGROM &amp; CHROM and put them into to the hybrid cartridge and it works perfectly. I have no idea why the CNROM cart. wouldn't work properly but now I have a cartridge that will work for mapper 0 &amp; 3.

<br />
<br />This is because of the way the ROM is hooked up to the 74161.  Your EPROM might need VPP to be pulled up to V+.  On the CNROM cart VPP goes to the 74161.  So, depending on what the game does with unused bits that it writes, the game could work fine (if it wrote 1) or it could shimmer (if they wrote 0)... or it could change depending on if the bit changes depending on the bank it's in.  
<br />
<br />Some EPROMs are fine with VPP "floating in the breeze" and unconnected, or pulled to ground.  Lots of older EPROMs though need VPP pulled to 5V to function properly however.  So for people designing boards, it's always a good idea to run VPP to 5V.  Failure to do so could cause trouble.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I just checked the 27C256 sheets and you are absolutey correct. I think I may be grounding the Vpp or leaving it floating, I will have to check. However whatever I am doing I think I did it consistently on all my devcarts. When we finish our latest CNROM game Moakun, I will see what I did with Vpp and see if it is connected to Vcc. If I ever see this happening again, I will try your tip. Thanks for the pointer. As per usual: READ THE DATA SHEETS should be my byword.

Thanks Kevtris for your advice. It's weird how the effect seems to happen on an erratic basis with different games on the same devcart and EPROM. That's why I suspected a software problem.

Even if an adjacent pin doesn't have the proper signal, how hard is it to solder a thin piece of wire to the nearest Vcc/GND? I often use either solid copper sripped of insulation (since it melts anyway), or a single strand plucked from stranded wire.

Once it holds down the pin witout moving, solver it is really hard, scince you have to still have the wire not moving, hold your iron, hold your solder and be carefull to make a decent solvering job all this at the same times. This just makes me mad.

<br />
<br />Like anything else, soldering is a skill that you acquire.  To make life easier, I do this:
<br />
<br />1) put some solder on the chip pin you wish to solder to (not ALOT but enough to give it a good coat.  this is called 'tinning')
<br />
<br />2) put some solder on the end of the wire you wish to solder also.  Not a lot... if you make a tiny ball that's OK... and I mean tiny- say 1/2 the wire's diameter.  if it's any bigger than this, you will have too much solder.
<br />
<br />3) with one hand, put the wire's tinned end next to the pin and heat both with the iron.  THere should be enough solder on both to make a good connection.  
<br />
<br />If done right, the two will be decently soldered.
<br />
<br />note:  If you dally too long, the flux on the solder will be gone and it won't work very good.  This method relys on there being a little flux left.  If you run out of flux, the joint made will be grey and dull.  If done right, it'll be bright and shiny.   You can also add a little flux is need be, but I never have to personally.
