The patterns for the snakes are simple, so multiple consecutive values can be stored without reloading anything.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I still think the tile update portion of that idea is possible but as Bregalad mentioned, the palette aspects make it more graphically limiting than other options. Every character and background would have to share the same palette, per level.<br /><br />Also, I don't think it would take both CHR-ROM and CHR-RAM. I believe I mistakenly said something about drawing to CHR-RAM from CHR-ROM but I meant PRG-ROM. I'm sure the program itself wouldn't have to be too big. Graphics on the other hand, think of how many KB of tiles per character you want. BG characters will have to be stored both ways, unless you reverse in CHR-RAM. I was thinking like a bank-swappable MMC3 with CHR-ROM replaced with large CHR-RAM.<br /><br />Anyway, you're right though that the idea I had would be too limiting to work. What do you need help with, just graphics? I've done some work with scanline splits but I'm sure it's not as good as what you'd program.<br /><br />Edit: Just a couple typos

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />For fighting games on the NES, I'm a fan of the idea of having one character use the background and the other use sprites. If they're always facing each other, like is common in fighting games, you don't even have to store flipped versions of the graphics, you can simply switch which character uses sprites and which uses the background as necessary.<br /><br />The biggest drawback of this method is that the background has to be blank anywhere the fighters can go. You could maybe decorate that flat area a bit with sprites so it doesn't look so dull, being careful to never use more than 1 or 2 sprites per scanline, as any more than that would cancel the advantages of having one of the fighters use the background.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />One thing I was thinking about is that all projectile attacks will have to be sprites, since they can't move horizontally at a different speed than the BG character. That might make it tough to have sprites left over to decorate the backgrounds.<br /><br />Multiple projectile attacks on the screen will have to flicker a little, but i don't think that's bad for projectiles, and we can leave the ones that define the hitbox so that a player never loses track of that with their eyes.<br /><br />I would personally treat the background character as an object, so collision testing would be the same with the sprite object. Then offset the scroll of his background strip based on his object's X/Y position.

You'll admit that your idea required CHR-RAM to scroll a (or both) fighter(s) while having a background there. However it also might need CHR-ROM in order to get new animations in fastly for the sprite part of the fighters. Anyways this is overly complicated and a bad idea in general.<br /><br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">For fighting games on the NES, I'm a fan of the idea of having one character use the background and the other use sprites.</div><br />Yes, the problem is that since this technical feature is the only reason we're interested in the project at all, we'll loose interest as soon as the game &quot;engine&quot; is done, and will never get a fully functional game. Once again. That's why I was more aiming at a tech-demo anyway, leaving the possibility to get a full game open.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">I would personally treat the background character as an object, so collision testing would be the same with the sprite object.

I am not a very skilled artist, and designing/animating 4x8 or 5x10 tiles sprites is harder than the usual 4x2 we're more used to. I mentionned that project because it's the only project where I needed animation done. I'm sorry for completely highjacking your thread.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">Actually there's an awfully common situation in fighting games where both players can be facing the same way: when one player jumps above the other, and the latter is still performing a move when the first one lands (players don't turn around until they're done performing their moves).

Punch Out got a custom mapper for its specific large-character needs; how about your game?<br /><br />It's really a question of which of these options seems best for your situation. There's no actual situation being discussed here AFAIK, so I'm tempted to use one of these ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ but maybe you enjoy the debate, so don't mind me.

If many developers just added more memory to their cartridges, we would have seen much more accurate ports on these older systems, and I thought that it's cool to show off what these systems are capable of without the unnecessary constraints like that.
