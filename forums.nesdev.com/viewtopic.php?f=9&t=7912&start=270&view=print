I put a disclaimer on my site pointing <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/viewtopic.php?f=9&amp;t=7912&amp;start=180#p111032" class="postlink">earlier in this thread</a>.  I find some of my PC's suffer from this issue worse than others.  But it's only an issue with the original firmware/anago, with my firmware/app I don't experience this issue.

I saw your efforts relating to this, but I'm not quite certain where things currently stand.  Can I just use the anago port you provided to dump my games through the Kazzo, or is there more to it than that?  I saw you also discussing LibUsbDotNet and inlprog, but it looks like inlprog is a flasher and I'm not sure if LibUsbDotNet is really needed.<br /><br />I recently discovered the Kazzo while searching for something to dump my NES games, having already gone through much of the rest of my library with my Retrode.  Product looks great, but I'd like to confirm I can make this work under Linux before ordering.<br /><br />Thanks, and thanks for your work getting this to work on Linux.

So judging from that you should be able to dump from one of his flash carts, but don't know if it will work with a third party cart. Don't know how useful it would be, dumping the code that you loaded in the first place. <br />  You may want to look at the thread for the INL FlashCart software <!-- l --><a class="postlink-local" href="http://forums.nesdev.com/viewtopic.php?f=12&amp;t=11020">viewtopic.php?f=12&amp;t=11020</a><!-- l --><br />Not sure what enhancements are included but....<br />Yogi
