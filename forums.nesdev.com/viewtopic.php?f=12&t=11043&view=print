		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Hey guys!  I'm new to the forums, so please forgive my ignorance if this question has been addressed elsewhere; I freely admit that I am not the best at exhausting all possible search options in the browser ^_^.<br /><br />Anyway, I am attempting to build a Star Fox 2 cart using a Doom pcb.  I have a sort of makeshift schematic I found online which details the parts required, as well as the connections which need to be made (albeit, in a rather crude manner).  It can be found here: <a href="http://consolemods.freeforums.org/starfox-2-battery-circuit-t42.html" class="postlink">http://consolemods.freeforums.org/starfox-2-battery-circuit-t42.html</a><br /><br />So I understand I need a 12 nf capacitor, the battery (of course, otherwise this entire exercise is futile and dumb), and a 1k ohm resistor; the problem I'm running into is finding an equivalent watchdog to use in lieu of the MM1026AF chip.<br /><br />This might seem an easy answer for some of you; I don't know.  My knowledge of circuitry is rudimentary, though I am picking things up here and there as needed (for example, I've made 8 nes-in-a-cartridge mods, and have streamlined the process to where the final product is quite sleek).  So I know the basics as far as soldering, choosing the correct gauge of wire, and how to translate an existing circuit board into a morass of wires and components; such as might gain the appreciation of the mad god Sheogorath.<br /><br />However, that is as far as my education extends; all basic reverse-engineering stuff.  So, when it comes to this particular chip I want, I do not really know what to search for.  I have a .pdf file which contains the technical specs of the chip, but aside from absolute values concerning current and voltage, it's all Greek to me.<br /><br />I've let this ramble on long enough; my apologies.  I just like to fully explain my position, in order that whomsoever decides to help me may know, from the start, exactly the sort of mess they're venturing into <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />.  Any sort of help on this topic would be greatly appreciated.  Thanks!

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Thanks for the info!  Greatly appreciate it ^_^.<br /><br />As I recall from the research I've performed on this matter, the reason I settled for the doom pcb with a jumpered battery backup was the sheer amount of concerns I found surrounding the GSU-1 FX chip's efficacy to run at the higher frequency (21mhz as opposed to 10.5), and the supposition that it can only support 8 mbit games, whereas the GSU-2 in Doom (and a few other carts) is said to handle 16mbit games.<br /><br />I also found an excel spreadsheet online which, while not exceedingly technical, does back up that Star Fox 2 is/was the 16mbit type.  Of course,  there's something to be said concerning &quot;the things one finds online;&quot; all I'm getting at is why I've made the assumption that doom is the best route to go.<br /><br />If nothing else,  it's also found in nigh every game store near where I live, and averages about 10 bucks.  Far as I know, stunt race is a bit more expensive.<br /><br />Of course, I am open to better suggestions/being set straight.   Could be everything I've just written is a lot of bunk;  for all I know, Vortex could work, given the right amount of Jerry rigging.  Dunno, though; never seen the pcb info for that one.
