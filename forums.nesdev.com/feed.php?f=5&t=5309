I'd imagine getting CC65 set up, and then compiling hello world.

Seems like it'd be relatively easy to put a custom BIOS in there, + a new chip select.  Then with an interface cable, you've got a hucard programmer/reader, and no need for a ROM emulator.  That was my plan for if I ever wanted to make a 1MB HuCard, to program it in-circuit like that.  But it was speculation since I hadn't investigated the unpopulated internal ROM, nor having any cool stuff to burn yet.<br /><br />I also have a ROM emulator (512kB), since it uses a 34-pin IDC cable I figured I could strip those and solder them to the PLCC pads.  Might not be as hard as it sounds (wires/pads are same pitch, at least), but I didn't try it.

If you make any future boards, would you be up to doing DIP? Or PLCC + dip and some room for a demux'r for chip select? Or anything like that? It'd be great to be able to use it as a ram board too. Would have to be all DIP for both sockets though because there doesn't seem be any nice 512k sram for plcc package.<br /><br /> Also, on the NES to SNES project. If you were to handle it similar to like what I did with the PCE projects, how would you handle simulating/emulating the PRG mappers?<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3645">tomaitheous</a> — Sun Jun 21, 2009 4:06 pm</p><hr />
