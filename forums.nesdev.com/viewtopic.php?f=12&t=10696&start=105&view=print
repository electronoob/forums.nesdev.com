I have been maintaining a test decompressor for each format change to test the compressor, and it just uses the 110000xx xxxxxxxx end mark as an assertion of byte stream consistency.<br /><br />Here's the data in the agreed format. It still leaves enough space for mono BRR at 16 kHz.

The crash is nearly 14 kB, which is more than half the total, but it loops nicely.  The BRR compression results in a very high broadband noise floor - only 25 dB below the signal peak in the case of the crash - but there's enough going on in the main body of the track that a bit of extra noise doesn't really stand out.<br /><br />Here's a comparison of the first few beats with and without the enhancement.  The main track is at 16 kHz, and the crash/hat/drum are at 32 kHz; all components have been separately passed through BRRTools.  Mix positions for the samples were chosen by eye at moderate zoom, to rule out unreasonable precision requirements.<br /><br /><div class="attachtitle">Attachment:</div><div class="attachcontent">

It's been a while since I studied digital controls and signal processing...  (The x-axis is actually Hz, not rad/s...)<br /><br />2) If this is right, are the peak and high-frequency falloff part of the intended behaviour, or are they artifacts of the fitting method (ie: would the ideal curve keep going up)?  What does the function it's supposed to be compensating for look like?  What sort of error magnitudes should I expect from this?<br /><br /><div class="attachtitle">Attachment:</div><div class="attachcontent">

	</div><br /><br />Also, I've noted that when filtering the track through BRRTools, using -g for both encoding and decoding results in a much duller sound than not using it for either, to the point of sounding noticeably worse when enhanced.  (The material in the example was not pre- or post-filtered).

I tried tracing it in the debugger, and it looks like the CPU gets screwed up hitting a #$ff byte that is not supposed to be there, and it ends up doing 768 tile patterns, which overflows from one frame buffer to another.  I'll try overwriting it to make it with #$c0, and see if that fixes it.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I have identified a problem in my encoder where a completely white frame would register as -1 tiles instead of 0 tiles. Internally in my encoder, $0000 is the all-white tile, $0001 is the all-black tile, and pattern tiles start at $0002. In any frame, the number of pattern tiles is equal to the maximum tile number in the image minus 1. For example, if the highest tile number is 295, there are 296 tiles, of which all but the first two are encoded, for a pattern table length of 294 tiles. This assumption fails for all-white frames such as frame 2707 (2727 in the original video; mine trims 20 leading black frames).<br /><br />The fix is to edit all $FFFF pattern table length words to $C000. I have fixed my encoder and tested the fix.<br /><br />93143: The preemph filter I made for that post is a symmetric FIR filter, and all symmetric FIR filters are linear phase. Try graphing it with linear frequency, not log frequency. The function it's compensating for is the <a href="http://problemkaputt.de/fullsnes.htm#snesapudspbrrpitch" class="postlink">&quot;4-point Gaussian interpolation&quot; in Fullsnes</a>. The peak and high-frequency rolloff are an artifact of using only 15 taps; an ideal filter would continue up to +11 dB.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Okay, I implemented the interpolator in Matlab, and it looks like it works.  It's hard to get an accurate picture of what's going on with non-integer resampling factors, because the FFTs no longer map nicely and the curve obtained by subtracting the power spectra gets buried in noise.  (I suppose I could try a moving average...)  But from just plotting the power spectra on top of each other, it does seem like the behaviour is fairly consistent.<br /><br />Consistent, but not frequency-independent.  If my code is right, even after correcting for input sample rate there's a bit of extra rolloff on 16 kHz data.<br /><br />EDIT:  I tried a moving average.  The 22.05 kHz case tracks the 16 kHz one.  Just so we're clear, this plot is normalized to the Nyquist frequency for the <em>input</em> data.<br /><br /><div class="attachtitle">Attachment:</div><div class="attachcontent">

	</div><br />I guess now I have a pretty good idea of what needs to be done to the audio before it's converted.  EDIT:  Got some settings figured out in PLParEQ3, for both 16 kHz and 32 kHz.  On white noise, using the equalizer followed by the gaussian results in +/-0.2 dB of ripple in the top end for both cases, which is more than good enough.<br /><br />...<br /><br />Who's writing the audio engine for this thing?  I haven't accidentally volunteered myself, have I?

Attached (in case anyone cares at this point) are BRRs of the crash cymbal, hi-hat, snare/kick, ch, k, sh, and t.  IIRC the k and t were taken from around 5:00-5:01 in the long version, and the ch and sh are from 2:01 and 2:17 respectively.

	</div><br />The volume of the samples has not been altered (except incidentally via prefiltering), so they will have to be taken down a bit to fit the streaming audio.  When I put a 16 kHz mono version of the original track through my custom prefilter, the peak amplitude went up by nearly 5 dB.<br /><br />[The BRR compression really does a number on this stuff...  kinda makes me wonder if it's worth all the precision I put in the front end...]<br /><br />...<br /><br />I don't get the same results from my gaussian interpolator as from BRRTools with -g turned on.  And it's not a small difference; using -g instead of my version makes the whole high-frequency augmentation scheme not work very well.  I'd think I did it wrong, but the curve I get at 32 kHz matches tepples' description (plus, tepples' filter is in BRRTools, and as I said before, using -g for both encoding and decoding muffles the output).  So I looked at the source code for BRRTools and found this:<br /><br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">void apply_gauss_filter(pcm_t *buffer, size_t length)<br />{<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;int prev = (372&nbsp; + 1034) * buffer&#91;0&#93; + 372 * buffer&#91;1&#93;;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;// First sample<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;for(unsigned int i=1; i &lt; length-1; ++i)<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;{<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;int k0 = 372 * (buffer&#91;i-1&#93; + buffer&#91;i+1&#93;);<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;int k = 1034 * buffer&#91;i&#93;;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;buffer&#91;i-1&#93; = prev/2048;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;prev = k0 + k;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;}<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;int last = 372 * buffer&#91;length-2&#93; + (1034 + 372) * buffer&#91;length-1&#93;;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;buffer&#91;length-2&#93; = prev/2048;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;buffer&#91;length-1&#93; = last/2048;<br />}</div><br />This doesn't look at all like what anomie and nocash describe.  It just looks like a symmetric smoothing filter with gain reduction.  Did I miss something?  What's going on here?

I normalized this in my own BRR decoder to [372, 1304, 372]/2048, which incidentally is very close to [2, 7, 2]/11.<br /><br />What <tt style="margin-left: 2px; margin-right: 2px; padding:3px; background-color: #3355aa; color: white;">apply_gauss_filter</tt> appears to be doing is convolving with [372, 1034, 372]/2048. I think there's a bit of a typo going on here (1034 when 1304 is intended), and this is causing the muffling you're hearing.<br /><br />Is source code for your prefilter available?
