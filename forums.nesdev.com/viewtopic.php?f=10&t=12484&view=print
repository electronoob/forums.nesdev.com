		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Something that I just could not figure out, when the coding of everything was too late. I was given info on how to solve it, but I couldn't get it to work. My rom project I released late last year, Zelda - The Legend of Link, experiences slowdown. I'm not worried about the physicalness of the slowdown, but the audio aspect, is the one im disappointed in the most.<br /><br />The sound engine is jsr'd to within the NMI. Back then I wasn't as smart with asm, and just figured I would throw in the jsr to the sound engine, within the hard wired bank, thinking that would do the trick.<br /><br />I feel my work would he much more appreciated, (myself included) if the audio experienced no lag. Would any advanced coders be willing to look at my current rom, and try to decipher how the sound engine could be spared from the significant lag it has? I'd be willing to pay $20 if that seems reasonable? <br /><br />Thanks for reading everyone. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":-)" title="Smile" />

It can't be fixed by optimizing the sound engine. You have to make sure that NMI stays enabled at all times (or is only disabled for very short periods of time), and that all of the other code in the program is aware that the NMI might fire at any time.
