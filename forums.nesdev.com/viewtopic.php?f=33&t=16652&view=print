It'll be a super-simple mobile-style endless climber game, based on my Robo-Ninja character from a different game.  Just started a couple days ago, so there's not much here yet, but at least I have a screenshot:<br /><br />We'll see what happens!

Once I add obstacles, it might be too cramped if I keep him the size he is now.  But I do want to keep him as large as possible.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">How does the wall facades work?

(but the arc also provides a place for my sprite-0 hit so that the spikes at the bottom have a nice smooth bouncing motion, (<a href="https://twitter.com/nathantolbert/status/926311909430910976" class="postlink">animated gif here</a>).<br /><br />Also, my palettes need some work, the current one washes out some of the variation in the walls that looked better in the original source graphics.<br /><br />Next step is adding obstacles so I can see if the large character is going to work.  If so, then I need to go back and spend some time on sprite-chr to see how many frames of animation I can pack in.<br /><br />(I need to check the rules and see what I'm allowed to do in terms of number of chr banks)

Part of it is that my palettes need work. There's supposed to be 2 different colors on the spikes, but while testing, I ended up reusing the same color twice in their palette.

It took me a few deaths before I figured that out - at first I figured that was what the sliding was. It's also a little tricky to control when there are spikes on both sides (although that could be by design!) as the ninja seems to jump slightly below where they are when jumping to the other side.<br /> <br />Also, on the page you link above you've got the text &quot;Nintenda&quot; instead of &quot;Nintendo&quot;.<br /><br />Congratulations on nearly completing it already, you're certainly got much farther along then I have!
