		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Even if it turns out to be wrong: I would bet it's only 40% guaranteed. I don't know how many people have examined the circuit how extensively, the <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.neviksti.com/wiki/TribalTap">http://www.neviksti.com/wiki/TribalTap</a><!-- m --> page contains some nice details, mixed with false assumptions, it doesn't really convince me. The only real argument would be that OUT0 isn't an input (which is my own finding, and I hope it's correct, and that I didn't misread the datasheet; for some reason, the neviksti page is just referring to that pin as &quot;B0&quot; instead of &quot;OUT0&quot;).<br /><br />And now that we do have the PCB photos, it's obvious that the player 6 data line can be connected to an input. I can't see a way how it could work without the diode, but <em>with</em> the diode installed it could be working just fine. It would just depend on how the PAL is programmed. Again the two possible theories are:<br /><br />1) Program the PAL to act as a flipflop. That may be unreliable with different PALs from different manufacturers (ie. it should work fine when using specifc PALs), but it might require some PAL pins being 'reserved' for that purpose (the circuit doesn't look like that, though some PAL pins might have dual uses).<br /><br />2) Or, read N-times from joypad 3 to get that joypad to output a stable low or high level for (de-)selecting port 6. Might be quite unlikely that they've used such trickery. On the other hand, the neviksti says that, when IO=0, &quot;controllers 3 doesn't get clock signal&quot;. Joypad 3 doesn't <em>need</em>  the clock, but it isn't actually <em>required</em> to suppress the clock - unless they did explicitely <em>wanted</em> to get a stuck joypad 3 data output.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I've noticed that Naki/Nakitek also made two other &quot;Tribal Taps&quot;:<br /><br />Nakitek &quot;Tribal Tap 5&quot; is a regular 5-player adaptor, not a 6-player adpator. The same thing (with the same case) seems to have been also sold by other companies (one called &quot;Gamester LMP&quot; and the other called &quot;Super Power&quot;). Anyways, concerning Naki/Nakitek, it would be interersting if they have started with the 5-player or 6-player adaptor - does anybody know which one came first? Or has PCB photos for those 5-player adaptors?<br /><br />And there is a Tribal Tap for 3DO (called 3Dzero on the package), apparently made by Super Ufo (not by Naki, unless Super Ufo is just a different brandname for Naki?). The case is resembling the SNES 6-player adaptor, and it's also having 5 sockets (for 4 SNES controllers, and one 3DO controller).<br />I don't know the 3DO controller protocol, but if it's different from the SNES protocol, then the 3DO tap must be probably containing a CPU for protocol conversion, so it's PCB might be looking entirely different. Still there's some possibilty that some of the uninstalled components on the SNES PCB are relicts from the 3DO version (unless the SNES version is ways older than the 3DO version).

If you can't read the chip, it's labeled 'FK888 412'.  Oddly enough, J2 on my board sticks way out of the board and the solder joint on one side is completely disconnected (the wire goes through the board, but the solder joint is 100% not connected... it's weird).
