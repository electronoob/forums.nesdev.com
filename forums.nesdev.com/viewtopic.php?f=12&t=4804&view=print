<br />WLA-DX is what I hate about SNES-dev. You have to use .W or .B to try to port NES games. (Although I am also recoding a couple routine)
<br />
<br />I am making a hack to enhance SMB1 (porting to SNES) using doppleganger's disassembly (although the game is in SMAS already. SMAS's Sprite arrangement is crappy in it's SMB1/2j port).
<br />
<br />Until there is a Windows Assembler with x816 (and SNES Opcode) compatibility and do not have to use .B/.W with opcodes. I am stuck with that one *OUTDATED* assembler
<br />
<br />________________________________________
<br />
<br />About the NSF Player: I would like it if you can use HEBEREKE.NSF for a demo music player for SNES under one of these two conditions:
<br />
<br />1: Make a DPCM porter/converter and player for SNES BBR format (Can give seperate DPCM samples to you to convert to BBR)
<br />
<br />2: Use NO DPCM at all, I can do that part already as a modded NSF. Since it is simple to remove DPCM Data and remove DPCM channel ASM

<br />
<br />Find Qwertie's documentation on SNES video registers. It elaborates more on what Yoshi explains in his docs and what's explained in other places. Which also brings me to say get Yoshi's documentation. I've heard stuff about anomie's documentation on rom hacking dot net which is up to date sort of, but I don't remember finding it very useful (I don't think I looked at it for very long). Then there was some official SFC docs floating around not so long ago, so uh, maybe back those up  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=":wink:" title="Wink" /> .
<br />
<br />Then there's probably some good info in this thread:
<br />
<br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://nesdev.com/bbs/viewtopic.php?t=3780">http://nesdev.com/bbs/viewtopic.php?t=3780</a><!-- m -->
<br />
<br />about an emulator to use for debugging.
<br />
<br />Then yeah, use WLA-DX. It's really not that awful. But I seriously don't know crap about SNES hardware and all that hi rom low rom crap in the header. Basically where you'll find yourself struggling is in the setting-it-up phase, initializing the system properly and making a good header. I kind of put learning about SNESdev aside after getting annoyed and having completely different results on different emulators with my test roms. I couldn't figure out some of the really basic stuff. I guess we're spoiled with the NES because it's easy to debug your stuff, with everyone having such great and up-to-date tools to do so.

<br />
<br />The problem is that CA65 has that in the WIP areas and possibly very incomplete, So the Assembler is no use right now for SNESdev
<br />
<br />Yes. Initianization is another gripe, and may look hard. but there is a INIT routine for x816 from SNES Developer's lobby.
<br />
<br />I can put together a version of the WLA-DX version of the INIT routine from the original wiki above. That is... once the 65c816 support CA65 has is completed
<br />
<br />(If you do not believe me about the WIP support stuff. Look at the ''What's New'' or something like documentation of the current version)
<br />
<br />EDIT: I read that may only apply if using CC65 with it, So I can do the assembler then.
<br />
<br />EDIT 2 (Off topic): Moral of this part of my story: Make sure you look at EVERY document and website concerning info about it and double/triple check it, or do not talk at all.

<br />
<br />Wrong.
<br />You don't have to specify accumulator/index size for wla dx in general and certainly not for porting NES games, it's optional.
<br />It will guess the current mode if you don't specify the size, probably by trying to keep track of the corresponding status flags.
<br />Putting the cpu into emulation mode and a sep #$30 should be enough.
<br />
<br />Wla dx might become confused once you start mixing 16bit and 8bit code, but that's another story.
<br />
<br />
<br />Also, here's a tip from someone who has already struggled to win the battle of getting his code to run on real SNES hardware:
<br />Only use Anomies register documents as reference and disregard all other previously published ones such as Qwerties or even Y0shis, the latter ones will only get you in trouble in the long run.
<br />
<br />Anomies doc absolutely is the most accurate and it describes every hardware quirk that can stop your code from running on the real thing.
<br />In fact, it tells you more about the hardware than the available official Nintendo documentation. 
<br />
<br />If you have trouble understanding something in Anomies docs, consult Nintendos official documentation available on romhacking.net. (the 1995-ish ones, not the 1989 prototype specs.)

<br />
<br />Anomie's Documents are what I am using right now, So I am pretty much set
<br />
<br />Thanks d4s, And say to that ''Mystery Person'' that I appreciated the tip.
<br />
<br />EDIT: The Last Complant about ''Lables'' Unlike ASM6 and others like DASM: 
<br />
<br />WLADX only uses this:
<br />
<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">Lable:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ;Insert ASM Routine&#40;s&#41; Here<br /></div><br /><br />But Does not allow:<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">Lable:&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;;Insert ASM Routine&#40;s&#41; Here<br /></div>
<br />
<br />And Is the official SNES docs illegal to distribute? If not, Does the official NES2GBC doc have to go in RHDN? I am confused!
