I began programming with DS Game Maker, and as the title suggests it was basically Game Maker + devkitPro + PAlib = easy NDS programming. The trial version limited objects or rooms or something, and the pro version costed either...$10 or $15. My enthusiasm about it is probably what convinced my dad to just give me the money in exchange for me lifting a few boxes.<br /><br />If I wanted to introduce people to programming in a profitable way, I'd do what the creator of DSGM did and give a trial version with a simple and fun tutorial PDF that gets you pumped like &quot;this is easy!&quot; then offer a low price to take restrictions off the program.<br /><br />And personally I wouldn't trust the PICO-8 with my money without at least being able to try it out. But I love the idea because these easy-to-use ways to learn to program really do take people far. An example that immediately comes to mind is <a href="http://cturt.github.io/articles.html" class="postlink">CTurt</a>. He started programming the same way I did and just read some of his articles, he's clearly gone down a pretty awesome path. He also used to hate me, a discussion not fit here.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=6832">nicklausw</a> — Tue Jun 06, 2017 1:56 pm</p><hr />

Beginners may want to do things that lofty technologies and decades of accumulated code have produced.  Our daughter-in-law has a degree in computer science, and graduated at the top of her class.  She's good at html, css, php, sql, and a lot of other stuff that's outside my field (I do have my own extensive 6502 website, but my html is very simple), and she maintains the website of a university, with online class scheduling, posting online classes, online tuition payments, and other things; <span style="text-decoration: underline">but she has no understanding of what goes on at the machine level</span>, like the instructions the microprocessor understands, how to write an assembler or compiler, virtually no concept of address or data buses or interrupts, etc..  We need those people, but it's not the field I'm interested in.<br /><br />The consumer stuff is especially complex, since consumers want things flashy and the market is so big.  Industrial, not so much.  USB is too complex for the hobbyist to write his own drivers, and if he did, the driver would take almost the entire 6502 memory map.  But try RS-232, which may seem terribly outdated, and now your drivers take a couple hundred bytes or less, and it will go fifty times as far as USB can, and you'll find it still in wide use on factory floors, even though it has been around over 50 years.  RS-422 and -485 can go both much farther and much faster than RS-232, but use the same UARTs, just different line drivers and receivers.  RS-422 can do 10Mbps at 40 feet, and RS-485 can do 35Mbps at 33 feet.  Both can go at least 90kbps at 3/4 mile.  I think you'll find the same kind of complexity story with Bluetooth and other things.<br /><br />If you want to start out displaying things in different colors and fonts and sizes and mix it in with graphics, and change window sizes and be able to minimize or tile the windows different ways, you'll have to start out with a lot of stuff already done for you, and you will probably remain ignorant of how all that works, like our daughter-in-law.  I started out on an AIM-65 computer in a class in 1982, which had a 20-character 16-segment LED display and a thermal printer with paper tape that was something like 2.25&quot; wide.  We used built-in routines to feed these; but we learned the assembly language, and how to talk to the I/O ICs, which we could later apply to writing our own routines to feed other displays.  It's not as fancy, but now you're learning to get control, rather than be a GUI appliance operator.  As your programming improves, you can envision how to start doing the fancier ones with windowing and so on.  You can't expect to start at the top.  Start at the bottom and work up; simple assembly language, learn I/O, add macros, learn to do structures, see how the innards of a higher-level language (HLL) work, etc..<br /><br />In any case, there are lots of stopping-off points one might choose.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=8130">Garth</a> — Tue Jun 06, 2017 1:51 pm</p><hr />

I had the luck to have a mother who could get me a laid off 286 zenit laptop from her work, and a grandmother who taught me there's things like cobol and fortran which she used to do when she worked and that i should pick up basic. I had less luck going to a school which didn't provide an opportunity to learn these things on schedule. <br /><br />Things are probably not that random any more at least in some parts of the world. But i try to advocate that every interested pupil should get a raspberry (or a pinebook when those become available) whenever there's an ear that would listen. I don't get why schools pay for windows licenses and fancy ipads when they could provide hardware that actually teaches something, for less. That should at least be an option.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=7508">FrankenGraphics</a> — Tue Jun 06, 2017 9:47 am</p><hr />
