I had a friend who rode the bus with me to school, and his Grandma was cheap on his birthday, and instead of getting him the real games for his 3ds, she instead bought him a bunch of these Game-And-Watch games for only a couple of bucks each, and he honestly thought they were crap, so he would take one on the bus each day and say that he was going to play with it, and then he would give them to me knowing I kind of had a thing for crappy LCDs, I don't think his mom ever found out to this day.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=8232">DementedPurple</a> — Tue May 09, 2017 7:10 am</p><hr />

LCD games are cheap and they sell and sometimes kids are interested in them. I had a Gameboy growing up, but I also wanted (and got for christmas) a Pro 200, which is a tetris-screen-based LCD multi-game.<br /><br />I also wanted a Sega Pico, but didn't get one. <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" alt=":(" title="Sad" /> I <em>did</em> get a Vtech Video Painter though, so that was pretty nice, <em>even though our family had a SNES</em>. <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" /><br /><br />Anyway, point is, they may be cheap LCD games, and while they may not be alternatives to other video game systems, they are indeed a video game system of their own.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=21">Drag</a> — Mon May 08, 2017 6:41 pm</p><hr />

There is another series of handheld games (Although technically aren't illegal and aren't famiclones) that really confuses me. If you've been on YouTube in the early days then you probably know who Ashens is. He basically buys a bunch of these consoles called POP-Stations which tend to almost always have similar designs to the PSP. Now they have quite a bunch of different PSP rip-offs, but don't get fooled, they all use the same LCDs that were only slightly impressive on the Game-And-Watch games back in 1980, and get this. They all only play the exact same 5 games (Approximately) which I can't quite wrap my head around. It's not like the famiclones where it's at least a bunch of different people making them, this is the same company! That would be like if Nintendo had all of there consoles rip-offs of other consoles, and they all played the same 5 game and watch games. These POP-Station people even were crazy enough to make a game about 9/11...

What confuses me is that the Power Kracker is still be produced today, and has been since at least 2014. How has Nintendo not caught this yet? It's not only a clone system, but also has dozens of copyrighted Nintendo games built in.

Yes and since patents probably doesn't work as it should in China, no one (including Nintendo) are able to prevent anyone else from making clones. That's why Nintendo have problems selling in China, there are too many illegal copies and clones for them to be able to make a profit, and no way to prevent this.<br /><br />In later years Nintendo have marketed their own iQue series of consoles in China that are often made too look like one of those cheap clones with built-in games. Only that you have to pay to unlock the games in it, and the games aren't bad hacks but official Chinese localizations of Nintendo games.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=6013">Pokun</a> — Mon May 08, 2017 1:19 pm</p><hr />

China is the most populated country in the world, so it's no surprise that multiple companies would try to make a profit on the current fad. Business is hardly ever driven by originality, most people just want a slice of a market that already exists. If you can offer any advantage over the competition, such as price, quality or availability, you might be successful at maintaining a business.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=95">tokumaru</a> — Mon May 08, 2017 9:29 am</p><hr />

I wonder why China had not only one famiclone, but so many others as well. I know why they would have a few, because China was once a communist country and they had a ban on video games until 2014, but come on! Are the people buying these consoles just not aware that they are buying the exact same console? Sure, a lot of consoles had similar graphics, and I could get confused too if that was the same, but most of these consoles have built in games, which are the exact games built in to every other famiclone! Do they just not know any better? It was probably like the pong consoles of the 1970's when video games were considered more of a novelty toy rather then an actual form of media and entertainment.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=8232">DementedPurple</a> — Mon May 08, 2017 7:46 am</p><hr />
