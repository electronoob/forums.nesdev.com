<br />(Programmer's perspective) Would it work on a PAL NES if you multiply all scanline counts by 15/16 before passing them to the VRC?

You can clearly observe this behavior by the way the games set the IRQ target number at NMI if I recall as that is the frame of reference point you have to set it at. Also it's known that the counter counts even if rendering is off or not happening.

The nametables live in $2000-$2FFF (A12=0), and the patterns used for the backgrounds are in $0000-$0FFF (A12=0). The patterns used for sprites are in $1000-$1FFF, which sets A12 to 1 and clocks the counter.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">I once heard that MMC3 is a more-featured clone of one of konami's early mappers</div>

<br />Yeah and that early verion of MMC3 has only the default CHR ROM and PRG ROM bankswitching. It lacks the alternate switching shemes, IRQ counter and mirroring control.
<br />
<br />MMC3's counter uses A12 which sucks because it forces you to use sprites on the right pattern table and BG on the left, and Konami VRC mappers uses M2 which sucks because it was designed for NTSC only. A good counter would use A13 (like the MMC5 I think).

<br />An A13 based counter would require exactly 42 fetches per line (34 bg and 8 sprite), restricting Nintendo's ability to make backward-compatible improvements to the PPU. These might have included doubling the secondary OAM and cutting out the dummy nametable fetches before sprite pattern fetches to allow 16 sprites per line, or a second VRAM port for accesses during draw like on the TG16. You can see this in NOAC famiclones, which tend not to run MMC5 games because their fetch pattern isn't exactly the same as that of an authentic 2C0x PPU.

<br />EDIT: fixed typo

<br />Do you know what extra features are available in the NOAC and how to access them? And also what clones use the NOAC in question? Just curious, as I probably wouldn't make a NOAC-specific game.

<br />Some games actually abuse the 8-sprite limitation to do clipping.

<br />That was exactly my problem in NESICIDE emulator with Link walking over the dungeon doors in Zelda...
<br />I emulated setting the overflow flag but not stopping sprite rendering on the scanline because of it.
<br />
<br />Doesn't he mean 42 fetches per scanline, 34 background and 8 sprite (not 42 sprite)?

<br />That wasn't so clear during the NES's commercial era. The Super Famicom/NES was originally slated to have NES back-compat.

<br />If the MMC5 relies on fetches of the PPU, I don't see why any other mapper shouldn't. (not counting how many games relies on precise timings for raster effects)
