I'm actually asking this because I don't have one, I don't think I've heard any (music from) games from any of the new systems that really turn my head. New Super Mario Bros. Wii, which has some of the same themes as in New Super Mario Bros, DS, are really good. And of course, the retro styled MM9, MM10 and Castlevania: The Adventure Rebirth have good soundtracks. But in terms of big blockbuster modern 3D special effect hollywood studio video games, what are your favorites?
<br />
<br />Man, I forgot Zelda. The Zelda franchise at least on console systems continues to have excellent music. I haven't played Spirit Tracks on the DS, but I found Phantom Hourglass to be somewhat lacking. There are some tracks that are really repetitive. Kind of like that one dungeon song in Rygar. Most of the soundtrack was absolutely fantastic, but that one song, is like four notes. (<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dd_PSq0KAE&amp;feature=related" class="postlink">here it is</a>)

<br />My newest console is a PS2, that I bought 2 years ago (I think) when it cost what a Wii costs you guys now. So maybe when the next generation consoles are released and the current ones have a considerable price drop I'll consider getting one.
<br />
<br />The console I have a modest interest in is the Wii, as it's the only one that has games that I actually feel like playing.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Does the PS2 count as well ? I know it's getting 10 years old soon, but it's the most recent home console I have, and is capable of playing streamed music (which would probably not differ in quality with current generation consoles).
<br />
<br />Two games I should mention are : 
<br /><strong>Castlevania : Lament of Innocence</strong> which has AWESOME gothic-style stremed songs which nobody should miss. They are honestly some of the best song ever made.
<br />
<br /><strong>Dragon Quest VIII</strong> has incredibly good orchestrated soundtrack too, but the Japanese version had a (rather) crappy sequenced soundrack, and unfortunately when I bought the OST I got the japanese verison (I wasn't aware it was different <img src="./images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" alt=":(" title="Sad" /> ). Yet the orchestrated songs are on youtube and you can listen to them. The whole game is made exculsively from classical music tough, and when playing it gets tiring after a while (I like a variety of genres when playing). On the other side, listening to the songs when not playing sounds surprisingly great.
<br />
<br />As for the NDS, I don't really know it is probably way inferior to the PS2 in therm of sound capabilities even if the system was released more recently. <strong>Castlevania - Dawn of Sorrow</strong> has without a doubt the best soundtrack I've heard on the system (although in therms of sound quality, it is around SNES/PS1 and not next gen systems). I liked some songs in <strong>Fire Emblem - Shadow Dragon</strong> but they are basically major remixes of NES songs (but there is a lot of originals too).

<br />Yeah, I've heard about that...piracy is about as rampant as in China, right?  Not much is legitimately available, and the games that are available are overpriced.  Such a shame.  I hope you get to own a Wii at some point, I really enjoy mine.

<br />
<br />- The question is: do you agree with piracy, of buying modded consoles and copied games? Do you junk or scrap greatest pieces of software for cheapest prices? Personally, I don't... and piracy is fully ignored by me.
<br />
<br />- Heh, rewriting the tokumaru' state: I do buy current consoles. Even if their prices here in Brazil is about twice what you pay in the US, I still look for some special discount/best offer, plus credit card payment. Also, newer games rarely get my attention, as Call of Duty (war/killing games). My first one was Halo 3: much annoying at beginning, but very cool near the end. ^_^;; Of course, I'm not in the mood for a PS3, since I own a X360.
<br />
<br />My newest console is a Wii. My X360 was bought around 2 years ago. Since its price was MUCH lower today and Mega Man 10 had been released, I couldn't wait for a X360 release, so I bought it. ^_^;;
