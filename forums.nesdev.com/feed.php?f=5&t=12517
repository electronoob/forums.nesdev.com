The primary reason for a board like mine would be for making a BenHeck style portable, which is actually the reason I did the mod, I just haven't gotten around to the rest of it.  By installing the full RAM onto the board directly, you're able to remove the memory pak slot entirely, which then allows the board to lay flat without anything sticking out at a right angle, which makes for a much better fit case-wise (assuming you also remove and reorient the cart slot like a typical GameBoy cart slot instead of the normal straight-out-from-the-board orientation).  You just have to wire up a few resistors on the data lines to terminate the RAM bus (basically the equivalent of hardwiring the jumper pak).<br /><br />In any case, if you have anything in particular you'd like me to test, just let me know.  I'm not nearly as familiar with the N64 library as I am with the SNES, so I'm not really sure what games may or may not be of interest here.  I do have a 64Drive, so I can test anything, including homebrew ROM's if anybody wants to write some code to explicitly test it.<br /><br />Here's a crappy photo of it in action, MM w/Jumper Pak<br /><a href="http://i.imgur.com/bOn70qU.jpg" class="postlink"><img src="http://i.imgur.com/bOn70qUl.jpg" alt="Image" /></a><p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=5348">qwertymodo</a> — Mon Mar 23, 2015 12:32 am</p><hr />

Toy Story 2 definitely still uses tri-linear filtering and stuff. Otherwise, it would look like the PS1 version, which is a bit more jagged in comparison. I looked at Yoshi's Story, but I'm not sure. (The quality on the video wasn't the greatest) You know, if you had an object that was perfectly 64x64 for the texture size and was distanced <em>perfectly</em> away from the camera and wasn't rotating or anything, wouldn't it actually look normal, or would the N64 make it look muddy because it is still trying to smoothen it out?<br /><br />You know, I wonder how Metal Slug would fare on the N64... It has the advantage over the PlayStation and the Saturn in that it can directly stream information from the cartridge...<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=6683">Espozo</a> — Fri Mar 20, 2015 7:29 am</p><hr />

It can take an arbitrary and widely-varying amount of time to draw a single polygon (even if flat shaded), so you don't have the same kind of &quot;display X sprites every frame&quot; that previous generation hardware had ... and you also don't have the requirement that you finish in 1/60th of a second. Instead, you tell the GPU to draw a triangle ... or a bunch of triangles ... with a bunch of properties.<br /><br />I know nothing about the N64 3d programming interface, but I'd randomly guess it looks like IRIS GL.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3512">lidnariq</a> — Thu Mar 19, 2015 6:15 pm</p><hr />
