		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Well, my Powerpak has decided to stop reading compact flash cards for some reason.  It was working great until this week when I flew to NY for Thanksgiving and brought my Powerpak with me.  Tried it in my bro's NES and another relatives' NES and they both are giving me "Fatal Card Read Error" messages.  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" alt=":(" title="Sad" />
<br />
<br />I tried reformatting the card and copying everything back, but nothing's working.  The card itself seems to be working great.  I've chkdsk'd it and copied files back and forth with no problems.
<br />
<br />As far as the Powerpak goes, if I remove the card it does say that no card is found.  Also, if I hold down A on boot, the Powerpak will give me the "card busy" message, but it never goes away.  Pressing reset will bring the "fatal card read error" back.
<br />
<br />Is there anything I haven't tried (sans a new card, which I'll have to wait till I get back home)?

<br />I will borrow a CF card from work tomorrow and test it, just to make sure it's not the PowerPak.
