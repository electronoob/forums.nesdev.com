Usually I do this by detecting long runs of $00 or $FF bytes. But if the $00 are actually the 64 attribute bytes of a nametable that uses only the first background subpalette, or the end of a lookup table for high bytes of note periods, that can cause unintended behavior.<br /><br />During initial play testing, I thought several games had bugs due to important zero- or $FF-filled data getting overwritten, but it turned out all these quirks have different causes. I'll report each in the game's own topic later.<br /><br /><ul><li>Scrambled map in <em>Cheril the Goddess</em><br />It's just not that visually distinct because it's monochrome.</li><li>Freeze on Game Over screen in <em>Filthy Kitchen</em><br />The unmodified ROM also freezes on my PowerPak.</li><li>Playfield attribute clutter in <em>Spacey McRacey</em><br />I run the unmodified ROM in FCEUX for Windows, fill $23C0-$23FF with value $E8, and reset, and the corruption remains.

Or is there a way to make most of the ROM not self-flashable after the cart is fully assembled, analogous to the SL1 write-protection jumper on the Nintendo DS mainboard (keyword: FlashMe)?</div><br /><br />Yes, it's the same USB adapter.  I keep saying I'm going to make a better (synchronous) one, but haven't done it yet.  When I do make a better one, I'll try to have it start it a backwards-compatible mode, if possible.<br /><br />Some FlashROMs do include sector write protect, AMD and Macronix at least, but probably not in a form we can use.  At least on the 5V ones, enabling protection is kind of like an EPROM, in that you need a 12V VPP or something similar.  So you can only use that in a chip programmer, and not in-circuit.  Whatever chip is on this board could be totally different though.<br /><br />We'd be safe with sector erase, unless the mapper has a habit of ignoring mapper writes or changing banks on it's own, which would be strange indeed. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br />For this version it would be hardcoded to only erase and write whatever sector numbers are reserved for it.  The process works like this:<br />-bootloader copies itself into RAM, then runs there<br />-waits for valid data packet (CRC16)<br />-if valid, write bank select register, erase sector, and write it<br />In this case I would just have it abort if it goes past 32kB or whatever is reserved for it.

I was writing to PPU $0000-1fff. Bug in the PPU loader code (it was supposed to write a zero after the end of data = zero bytes to write, so that it would exit the PPU write subroutine...it didn't write a zero... so it assumed the next 2 bytes was a PPU address, it wasn't). Should be fixed now, see official RPSLS thread*. (Rock6.NES)...though I might make lots of changes to the game (including graphics) so any effort you make now to put into the multicart might be a waste of your time.<br /><br />* <!-- l --><a class="postlink-local" href="http://forums.nesdev.com/viewtopic.php?f=32&amp;t=15481&amp;start=15">viewtopic.php?f=32&amp;t=15481&amp;start=15</a><!-- l -->

I'm fairly certain they have no such protection.  I'm not really interested in a flash chip that can't be programmed in circuit.<br /><br />I'm probably going to have to shelf this idea for next year, but I was considering using my new dual port design for the cart release.  Was thinking of making all the LE's standalone versions at my own expense with full USB and SDmirco.  I'm making good progress with hardware dev but it's been slow going.  I'm not expecting I'll have a poslished design fully beta tested and ready for production in time.  Not to mention all the software tools to make it useful.  Last thing we want is the cart release hung up on half baked hardware.

The problem is similar to that for the self-flashable variant of <a href="https://wiki.nesdev.com/w/index.php/UNROM_512" class="postlink">RetroUSB UNROM 512</a>, where a dual 2-to-4 decoder circuit enables flash writes only at $8000-$BFFF, flash reads only when not writing, and mapper writes only at $C000-$FFFF. This allows $C000 to control A18-A14 before each write to flash.<br /><br />Correct me if I'm wrong, but I imagine that self-flashing in the Action 53 mapper would follow these steps:<br /><br /><ol style="list-style-type: decimal"><li>The mapper needs to generate /OE and /WE.</li><li>Configure the mapper for 32K game size: $5000=$80, $8000=$00-$03</li><li>Switch to a 32K bank: $5000=$81, $8000=bank number</li><li>Select the inner bank register, which causes writes to $8000-$FFFF not to affect the mapper's PRG bank output because the game size is 32K</li><li>Write commands to $D555, $AAAA, $D555. </li></ol><br /><div class="quotetitle">infiniteneslives wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"> I'm not really interested in a flash chip that can't be programmed in circuit.</div><br />By &quot;in circuit&quot; do you mean in a Kazzo device with full expansion pin control or in a stock NES or Famicom?<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">calima wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">Do you still need it converted to NROM?</div><br />I'd prefer it.

I've resisted altering them myself because I don't want to make &quot;yet another NES palette&quot; but most other palettes are horridly oversaturated, so I deal with it. <br /><br />Anyway, here are some files that might help There is an .aco and an .act file (two different photoshop palette formats) and the nestopia_yuv palette that comes with FCEUX (also included in the zip, but should be in your FCEUX palette folder if you have it installed). The Photoshop files were built using eyedropper selections from an FCEUX screenshot that (I&quot;m 90% sure) used the .pal file included (from the LoopyNES palette ROM). The .aco / .act / and attached png should 100% be using the same palette as the screenshots though.<br /><br />Oh, and here's another screenshot, with dithering, but with a different scaling mode of those NES controllers.<br />As for Waddles, I tried to avoid manually touching any of them up as much as I can. It's a slippery slope for me, and I know I'd end up trying to pixel out a lot more than necessary by hand. Feel free to take a go at it though.<br /><br />As for the 240p screenshot, is that the white circle on black? If so, I pulled a screenshot of that when I did the others, just didn't include it. It's attached as well.

I prefer to have the kazzo always capable of erasing and reflashing.

I <em>think</em> self-flashability in the console (without expansion pins) and CHR RAM bank output would both fit in the CPLD, but only INL could confirm that.</div><br />Both of those features have been available on all A53 released cartridges to date aside from the very first batch of 50 which used EPROMs.  The old XC9536XL implementation utilized 27 of 36 macrocells.  With us stepping beyond 4Mbit with 3v flash, the CPLD of choice due to my current board designs will be Mach XO-256 of which we'll only be using a small fraction (~10% perhaps) of it's available resources to implement current mapper 28 definition.
