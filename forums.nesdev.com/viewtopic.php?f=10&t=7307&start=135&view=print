<br />Okay, so a ushort (2 bytes) lets one address 64 kB. Usually only half of that can be bankswitched, which is 32 kB. So anything larger than 32 kB must use bankswitching. 512 kB seems absolutely gigantic then.

<br />Yeah, which means that there's not much left for other game objects. I guess you could design levels with lots of platforms and few wide plain areas, so that the 3 players don't stay horizontally aligned very often.
<br />
<br />Actually, when you think about it, the NES has a lot of games that defy the sprites per scanline limit, but were made anyway. Look at Double Dragon for example: you often have 3 people (who are often wider than 16 pixels, BTW, specially when lying down) on the screen at once, plus weapons and even things you can throw... And the game was a big hit. From that we can conclude that a little flickering doesn't hurt anyone.
