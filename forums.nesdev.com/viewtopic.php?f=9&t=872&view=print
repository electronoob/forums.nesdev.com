		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />As mentioned in previous posts, I'm working on my (first) dev cart, an NROM one.
<br />
<br />I was looking around on Romlab, and found this picture:
<br />
<br /><img src="http://nintendoallstars.w.interia.pl/romlab/nesepr4.jpg" alt="Image" />
<br />
<br />It's not a whole lot of help because I'm new to most electronics / soldering, which is why I'm going for the NROM first (with no re-wired pins, etc).
<br />
<br />I found this on the old message board:
<br />
<br />Subject	Re: NES DevCarts: NROM, more?  	  
<br />Posted by	philtulju
<br />Posted on	5/14/03 1:19 PM
<br />From IP	63.251.238.194 
<br />
<br />---snip---
<br />
<br />I added some wire and a jumper to accomodate horozontal or vertical mirroring, wiothout having to solder. There are 2 "pseudo-switches" on the board, for the two mirroring options, which are connected with a solder blob. Desolder this to access the three leads you need for a switch or jumper.
<br />
<br />---snip---
<br />
<br />If anyone could simplify this even further, I would appreciate it. I seen the H / V swith on the NROM board with the blob, and I'm curious how I could install a swith.
<br />
<br />Thanks in advance,
<br />

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Now I'm a bit confused. I thought I would have to solder wires near the actual V / H on the chip itself (as pictured).
<br />
<br />I am using an SMB cart, and it only had three chips to begin with: PRG, CHR, and one 16 pin chip on the left.
<br />
<br />I looked for VRAM information on NESDEV / romlab, and it shows a 28 pin chip.
<br />
<br />Just curious where PPU A10/11 is, and the VRAM A10.

<br />I did notice that the sockets were 32 pins. Glad to see it worked anyway. When the rest of my shit arrives in the mail I'll let you know how mine turns out.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Today I made a CNROM cart, and it works fine. However, I'm having trouble with the switch. I used a SPDT switch. First I soldered one wire to each of the three posts. I took the left wire, and connected to the H. The right wire went to the V. The middle wire connected to each of them. I made a quick pic to show you how I did it. I didn't have stranded wire, so I laid the one wire across the other two, and soldered it down (like it looks in the picture). I'm not sure what I did wrong, but it didn't work. When I booted a game, the graphics were garbled - no matter which position the switch was in. I desoldered it and set it back to H mapping, and now the cart works fine.
<br />
<br />Any help would be appreciated, thanks!
