Being an embedded systems guy myself, I see this issue both in software and in hardware.  A REALLY good example in the hardware realm is the state of the average donor cart based &quot;reproduction&quot; cart you see, or also the quality of work by people getting paid to do console mods.  There are very few people willing to take the time to learn to do it right, and for every Markfritzb or infiniteneslives there are dozens of idiots who don't know a soldering iron from a wood engraver.  Or back to Drag's original point about Arduinos, it astounds me when I see people selling completed projects where they're literally selling pre-programmed Arduino boards, rather than designing a board for their own actual application.  It increases the cost tenfold, it's almost always HUGE and it's just super tacky.  I mean, sure there has to be a learning curve for everything, but part of that learning curve should be knowing when a product isn't release-worthy.  Unfortunately, I think a lot of that would be best taught in a mentorship/apprenticeship learning paradigm, which is pretty much the exact opposite of the way most people learn these days...<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=5348">qwertymodo</a> — Mon Mar 23, 2015 12:55 am</p><hr />

I've had quite a journey myself in this regard. I started coding in '96 in QBasic. I was part of the QB RPGs craze. I knew *absolutely nothing,* except some extreme basics of putting together a simple scrolling engine in mode 13h. Naturally at age 16 I thought this meant I was some kind of god coder. This completely wrong self perception continued through college, and I still knew nothing. I took my first job. I still hadn't learned anything, helped develop some of the worst software I think I've ever seen in my entire life. Probably will never see anything worse. The industry wants people *that* badly. Yet I kept trying. Then I found my way to NES homebrew. Still knew almost jack squat. Once I began to build Nomolos, I started to learn a bit more about how software should be put together. I made a lot of mistakes. The game has tons of flaws. I released it. Now I'm working on another game. It too has flaws but it's much better than the last. I'm looking forward to releasing it.<br /><br />I dunno if I belong in the same category as people who slap together yet another god awful app in the play store (probably not, and maybe that was the origin of this thread anyway), but...there's no question, I have benefited greatly from actually building and releasing things. I'm a much better coder today than I was in say 2008 or so.<br /><br />On a different note, I do find a lot of digital distribution platforms annoying sometimes just in terms of the sheer volume of crap that gets released. Perhaps the feeling is that a large number of those people *don't even care* about becoming better programmers. That certainly isn't true in my case!<br /><br />In the words of G.K. Chesterton, &quot;a thing worth doing is worth doing badly.&quot; I think I might never have released my first game nor would I be close to finishing my second game if I didn't take that to heart. I don't consider it to be mutually exclusive with its counterpart &quot;a thing worth doing is worth doing well,&quot; either.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3735">GradualGames</a> — Sun Mar 22, 2015 7:33 pm</p><hr />

I don't know how else to phrase it, but those bold enough to release a body of work with their name attached into the hands of the cynical public, are those most likely qualified enough already.<br /><br />The crap sinks to the bottom anyway. Better to not have photos of your face plastered all over the product, or you'll sink with it. If you keep the same name on multiple works, those that hate you have an easier time of avoiding your work.<br /><br />In some regards gamers are the worst customers because they'll hound whoever to the ends of time over a matter of let's say $30. Never mind that gaming is inherently about spending &quot;disposable income&quot; and &quot;wasting time&quot;. Kind of. I still don't believe that reasoning 100%, and would point out the social aspects and the fact that it does exercise the mind.<br /><br /><br /><br />There's another thing I could rant about... this idea of employability...<br /><br />Employability in the capitalist sense is:<br /><br />-<ul>Being a clock puncher... consistently showing up there at the hours they want you there, not the hours where you can maximize your output.</ul>-<ul>Being able to sit (or stand) transfixed on a humdrum task, just like at school, for excessive amounts of time that will affect your health and mental well-being.</ul>-<ul>Being good at making other people rich, in the sense of both positive and negative meaning... you enrich your customer's life with your creations, but the goal is that you are getting about 5% or less of the value of your work output, and your employer is getting the other 95%. And you're somehow okay with that.</ul>-<ul>Not directly pointing out the bad decisions of your superiors in a group setting. (falling in line).</ul>-<ul>Being able to pretend like you have a life independent of work in a colorful monday morning story. In reality if you are gainfully employed your life revolves around your job. Your weekend wasn't that wild... because here you are bright and early!</ul>-<ul>Being able to keep secrets.</ul>-<ul>Not being instantly offensive.</ul>-<ul>Somehow having skills to still get along with the coworkers that continually throw you under the bus. Especially the salespeople. Oh, and even if the HR person isn't worth the dirt that comprises their cells, if you treat them as such, you're not employable. This is the first test.</ul>-<ul>Giving up on the concept of pointing out the dead weight... first of all unless you are a manager, you don't truly know unless you yourself are wasting too much time spying on that person to be doing anything productive. If you are trying to get a typical slacker fired, then they will passionately focus their otherwise wasted time on making *your* life miserable. This is how they survive (for a while).</ul>-<ul>Being used to ambiguous feedback and mixed signals. Realize that the higher up the manager is, the stranger the signals and statements will be. Face them dead-on (nobody likes shy or avoidant people), and smile and nod and be happy in agreement. To whatever bullshit just came out of their mouth.</ul>-<ul>Being one of those people who have had the &quot;Delayed Gratification&quot; concept beaten into them... Your reward for all this hard work will come... later. Those that pass the experiment of, if you will not eat this marshmallow sitting right in front of you now, then I will give you two sometime in the future!</ul>-<ul>Somehow pretending that you don't know all this, and continue to march on.</ul><p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=4151">whicker</a> — Sun Mar 15, 2015 10:45 pm</p><hr />
