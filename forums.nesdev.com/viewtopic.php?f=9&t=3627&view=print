<br />
<br />I got the mail issue straightened out, so I can accept orders from people out of the country again.  If you want a copyNES, better hurry up, hehe.  Once these two are gone, I will sell off the remaining stuffed/tested boards.
<br />
<br />As before, it's $55 + shipping for a completely stuffed and tested PCB, with IDC connector, 6 foot DB-25 cable.  You remove your CPU, add the sockets that are included and plug in the copyNES board and plug the CPU into the board.  
<br />
<br />If you wish to buy a board without the cable, it's $49 + shipping.  Once the two cables are gone I will sell off the remainder of the tested/stuffed boards for $49 + shipping.

<br />
<br />Nothing, but I figure people would want an "official" cable that was tested/working instead of going out and buying one.   The cable's just a DB-25 male to DB-25 male straight through cable and nothing special.

<br />Btw usually the guns are higher wattage if this is something high  with no temperature adjust you going to want a smaller iron like something around a 30w iron sence something high will both burn your board and fry the IC's

<br />could not tell how extencive the dameage is without seeing the outer side of the board

<br />how I would go about repairing it is to scrape off the soldermask on the remaining trace then solder small peaces wire to it  in order to make the connection to the throughholes, you would have to do it with the dameaged traces on both sides of the board
<br />
<br />also once more I am guessing you used a 100w soldering gun?
<br />your going to want to get a 15w soldering iron to continue the work. This is assumeing you did not fry the CPU in the process of removeing it with way too much heat

<br />The other side of the board looks much better than that side, the silver circles are all still present.
<br />I got the chip from another NES so I'm not too worried about the fried one. I've only got a few old style NESes left and the 1 CopyNES that I really don't want to break/ruin with my shaking hands.
<br />Maybe someone would like to do this for me? I can pay for it.

<br />
<br />just a repair the throughholes and solder in the sockets after that plug the CPU into that and  try out the nes, if this is working then all you have to do with the copynes is plug it in the same way you did the CPU
<br />
<br />this way nothing rare or expencive is being risked
<br />
<br />but before you plug in the copynes you can just cut the old capasitor out and solder the new one to its legs then you would have to carefully cut pin 4 on the CIC and your done
<br />
<br />btw here ia a little soldering guide it is more geared twards modchip installs but the pricaples are the same <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://soldering.tehskeen.com/">http://soldering.tehskeen.com/</a><!-- m -->
<br />
<br />
<br />everyone has shakey hands when they start but with enough practase it really become a simple matter even to solder to very small IC's
<br />
<br />note witch would have come in handy sooner: the solder suckers are not all that good at removeing solder from throughholes your better off useing braid
<br />
<br />note2:40 is still a little high for this kind of work I think you would be better off with a 15w for soldering and 30w for heavy desoldering as long as you onley touch the braid with the  iron and not the board

<br />
<br />As an observational note I didn't really think it would so hard to install; I had no trouble at all installing a mod chip a few years ago on an old PS1. I'm eager to get this installed and start dumping; once I'm sure it's working I'm going to try porting one of the windows clients to OSX, which I'm excited to play with even if it never works.

<br />
<br />both methods mentioned are about the same in difficulty and both should work so pick the one you feel like doing although stringing longer wires would lower the signal quality but should not be enough to be a problem 
<br />
<br />but to clarify what I said you would take a needle and crape off more of the green stuff that covers the closest trace witch is not damaged to expose more metal to make it easy to solder to, attach 30 awg or smaller wire to the place you scraped off then put it  through the throughhole and solder it to the appriprate place on the outher side of the board then jam the socket in over it and solder it in place
<br />
<br />
<br />ether way you go keep in mind that the connections on the other side of the board need to be made also and some of the holes may be damages to the point where just putting solder on the back might not do that trick 
<br />
<br />looping 30awg wire with plastic removed straight through the holes and soldering to the other side would guarantee this and you should still be able to jam the socket in over them

<br />
<br />Oh my.  Well if you wish to try fixing it (if only the bottom is affected) then it shouldn't be TOO tough.  It looks worse than it really is.  First, obtain a 40 pin *machined pin* socket.  It must be a machined pin socket or else it won't fit the copyNES board well.   Then solder it where the CPU went.
<br />
<br />Next, here is the important part.  Whip out your multimeter and TEST each connection.  This is the sure way and if you get continuity on every pin, it *will* work.  (provided the CPU isn't blown or something)
<br />
<br />test the pins. If you get continuity, move to the next pin.  If it's open circuit, carefully use an x-acto knife to scrape the solder mask (green stuff) off the copper and solder a fine wire from the route to the pin.  Repeat for all broken routes on the chip.
<br />
<br />Plug the CPU in and it will work if all connections are good, the chips are good, and there's no shorts.
