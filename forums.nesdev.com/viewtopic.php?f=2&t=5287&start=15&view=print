Doynax, a user here, did a really cool polygon filling engine (with real time 3D) that I was pretty inspired by, and it actually led me to design a polygonal movie engine. It basically shows predefined frames of 2D polygons in sequence, so I could make a movie like the one that was shown for the NES, but nothing would be rendered with 3D calculations, and it would have a really low frame rate (I didn't optimize it enough, so it runs at like 6-8 FPS, haha).

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />The C64 is a completely insane platform and the whole C64 developpement scene is completely insane. It's really surprising how the system is only able to do crap natively, but how it can be tweaked to do absolutely awesome thing by fooling the VIC II (C64's ppu) with tricky timing and stuff.
<br />Also, the CPU and VIC II acess to video RAM alternatively each cycle, so it is possible to write and read VRAM at any time, at the price of very low CPU frequency (it's twice slower than NES' : less than 1 MHz !!)

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I said something LIKE. I didn't command you to go out and make something better.
<br />
<br />But yeah you could probably do something closer to that if you were using PAL (the vast majority of C64 demos are in PAL because most sceners (people who make demos) are in Europe) and chopped off some scanlines. Even if you didn't remove a whole bunch of scanlines you could probably do some cool 3D effects. I mean PAL gives you 70 lines of VBlank to work with, so that's 3.5x the amount of VBlank time to work with compared to NTSC. So if the only bottleneck in your program is VBlank, you could draw 3.5x more dots per frame or speed up your updates without extending VBlank.
<br />
<br />And you don't need a whole lot of dots to make a decent looking 3D object. Look at this <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ-OcS2Gwvk" class="postlink">NES demo</a> for instance <a href="http://www.pouet.net/prod.php?which=31539" class="postlink">(ROM here)</a>.
<br />
<br />But what you've got right now is great. If you want to do something else with it, that's your choice.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />That was beautiful! Wow, I was totally fooled by the spinning gears at first, but looking at the pattern tables, it was obvious how it was done (4x4 pixels, all possible combinations fit into the pattern table). But it looked surprisingly great for the pixels being so big. I still don't understand the twisting tubes though. I saw that in another demo, and I don't know how it's done, and think it looks totally awesome. The winding path was awesome too. And the spinning box is really impressive looking, though I think I can see how it was done. That would be perfect for something like a developer logo, though it might take up to much graphical space. I'm very impressed. It really inspires me to optimize my polygonal movie engine and start making something cool.

The amount of cycles in a PAL scanline is 15/16 its NTSC counterpart. Taking that into account, the PAL CPU has "only" 3.28 more times VBlank than NTSC (not that it really changes something), but also when doing raster timing tricks, you only have 106.5 cycles per scanlines instead of 133.6, which means there is less computation possible between each raster split.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"> I still don't understand the twisting tubes though.

<br />I guess it's just two tubes in the pattern tables with all possible distances, and they change the scroll each scanline.

<br />
<br />I can only work on such fun stuff in short bursts, e.g. like during those two vacation weeks I just had. Now it'll rest again for a while, until another window opens where I can dedicate some time to it. That's why I try to work very focused towards my goal.
<br />
<br />What I can offer is my code though. The dots positions and directions are stored in the "XPOS", "YPOS" and "CURRDIR" arrays and they're accessed through xposPtr, yposPtr and currdirPtr. 
<br />
<br />If you want to experiment with it, you can just apply another movment code by tweaking lines 252-327. A and X are free to use there, Y indexes the current dot <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />
