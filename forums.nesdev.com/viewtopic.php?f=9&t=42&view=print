<br />There is no technical informations for now ... no. The dumper needs to be improved but is working. We are breaking the head on Maniac Mansion cart which has a particular structure (no CHR rom).

<br />
<br />actually the problem is still here but we changed a bit our mind. We will release plans and software to use the dumper. Documentation will be provided to develop your own memory chip manager.
<br />
<br />Just 2 days to wait before we put that online <img src="./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" />

<br />
<br />The problem is that we don't find the problem too : we sucessfully dumped the US cartridge.
<br />(F) and (G) too but data are messed up. Is there any knwow difference between PAL and NTSC games ?

<br />Actually it is. The memory chip is MMC1B3
<br />And the cart :

<br />The MMC1 isn't a memory chip, but a discrete logic chip (or am I saying wrong ?)
<br />Edit : Wait. MMC1B3... I only remember that MMC1B1 and MMC1B2 exists... The only difference between various MMC1 versions would be the SRAM enabling/disabling or something.... Maybe it's a trick with D5 of MMC1 reg 3 ? More info would be welcome.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />if you already have the cart open if I am not mistaken wouldn’t a low tec solution would be to dump the roms directly using a EPROM programmer all you would have to do is solder wires to the back of the roms mach up the pinout to a equivalent programmable rom stick the wires in the appropriate slots in the programmers socket and hit read chip if you don’t want to solder to the cart the pins sticking out the back of the carts board are long enoth to attach a socket to you can solder to that (you would have to use zif sockets to get a good enoth connection sence a regular one would not clamp down on the pins) 
<br />
<br />a bit of a hassle if you want to do a lot but for one cart if would seem like the simplest way 
<br />
<br />then to get it emulator playable assumeing there is chr rom you just use the "copy /b prgrom.bin+chrom.bin combinedfile.bin" command to combine the files  then open it in a hex editor add 16 bites to the beginning and type in the apprpreate mapper information then your done

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Hello ^^
<br />
<br />a bit late (we had some web domain trouble) but now the new website is open.
<br />All the dumper schematics are here : <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/enes/">http://sourceforge.net/projects/enes/</a><!-- m -->
<br /><strong>Documentation</strong> : schematics of the dumper
<br /><strong>Carbonara</strong> : dumper software
<br /><strong>Libspaghetto</strong> : dumper driver (included in Carbonara too)
<br />
<br />It would be easier to unsold the roms but we cannot do that : some are lended carts so we can't deteriorate them. The only thing we do to the cart is opening it to look for chip infos.
<br />
<br />However I don't have infos on the MMC1B3, it is not very well documented.

<br />An MMC1B3 behaves exactly the same as any other MMC1, and the MMC1 is very well <a href="http://nesdev.com/wiki/?page=Nintendo+MMC1" class="postlink">documented</a>.
