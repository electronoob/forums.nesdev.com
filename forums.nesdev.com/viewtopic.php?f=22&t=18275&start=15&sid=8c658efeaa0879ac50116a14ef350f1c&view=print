Do they look okay?<br /><br />There's also now music by <a href="https://maple.pet/" class="postlink">maple</a>, and I made it so that after you land a piece with a soft drop you need to press Down again to start another soft drop, and can't just keep holding it.<br /><br />Next I want to put in sound effects, a better randomizer based on least-recently-used, maybe some more polish (not a huge priority) and also make more gimmick modes to play with.<br /><br />The high-contrast theme uses $0C as the background color now; not sure how much I like that. Maybe it should be $0F but I kind of like having one that isn't black or white.

Right now the squirrel theme still isn't the default, but perhaps it should be! I should probably also just give all tilesets the full treatment in being able to choose a white or black background, too.<br /><br />While the in-game instructions use pictures, the text-only instructions (for a menu or whatever) should probably use the word &quot;domino&quot; to describe the pieces you're placing.

Singleplayer mode now has a tentative background with pawprints instead. I tried a background using sprites and it was a bit too distracting and I'm hoping this isn't.<br /><br />Also changed the name of the game to <em>Squirrel Domino</em>.<br /><br /><img src="https://i.imgur.com/iqK5eJR.gif" alt="Image" /><br />I added a mode where the pieces are not very firmly connected and any match will cause anything that's not supported by gravity to come falling down. It's helpful when you want to drop some tiles down into a narrow pit.
