Mmm, I can't believe I forgot those exact details on those, I thought DK was open bus problems for some reason, can't believe I was that wrong. But either way, even the difference in the PAL NES controller port won't make a difference to me, my plan will work on all officially made Nintendo consoles, don't fret. <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" /><p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=4311">3gengames</a> — Mon Jan 23, 2012 8:37 pm</p><hr />

Nintendo could still send a Cease and Desist notice to people selling these illegal products. As tepples noted, the copyrights on the games are essentially forever to us at this point.

What NES has a row of 10K resistors on the data bus? lol. If so, that'd mean games like DK ripped from WiiWare with bus issues wouldn't have happened like they did when RetroUSB released it, but people had problems on their NES's. And then the same with the powerpak, why did they need to add pull ups there? They aren't there AFAIK.<br /><br />And what would be those "obscure ways" and why would it work different from an NTSC NES? Are the physics in europe different or did they change the console? heh.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=4311">3gengames</a> — Mon Jan 23, 2012 8:04 pm</p><hr />
