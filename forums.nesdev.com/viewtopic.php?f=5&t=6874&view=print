		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Today I decided to spoil myself and bought an AV famicom on my way back home.
<br />
<br />The first thing I saw when I tested the machine is that the video quality is better compared to the normal famicom. Another thing that I didn't expect and was surprised was that the audio quality was improved too. I didn't know the RF was impacting the sound that much.
<br />
<br />Now back to the topic. After testing the gamepad, the so called dog bone ones, they are indeed better than my original famicom one (maybe it just because my unit is too old, who knows). But... After playing for a while, even thought they are better, they don't seems to match my good ol' toaster nes squarish pad I had in the past.
<br />
<br />I remember them. The quality was better. The buttons and pad was better. The ergonomy was not (except the buttons) but the rest was good.  The dog bones one are good but they feel cheap.
<br />
<br />Am I the only one to feel that way? I miss them. But now that I have an AV famicom that you can plug the gamepad (big duh! for the famicom), I could always buy some toaster nes one someday. I should have never sold that brand new one I had.

It feels just as solid, to me, as the original rectangular ones. I keep my original rectangular controllers with the NES itself though, gameplay feels truly retro when using those  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" />   It amazing, after so many years of mashing, how those things can keep working so well. That's quality.

<br />
<br />Actually, at least in the case of my dog bone, the d pad is firmer. I got my NES I think after it already went out of production, in 1994 or 95 (somewhere around there). And, I actually got a dog bone controller even later..so it may just be newer.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />The dog bone controller is much more ergonomic, HOWEVER, the D-Pad on it is really bad. When playing Battletoads you REALLY need the square controller because with the dogbone, for example if you press right, you might acidentally end up pressing right+up or right+down without actually touching the up or down buttons (this applies to all directions btw).
<br />
<br />The buttons are shaped "outies" instead of "innies" too. Whenever this is better or worse is a matter of preference, personally I don't care.

<br />Blargg, too bad 2 consoles have to be sacrified for this to be done. I have a NES that is not working, but I have only one SNES. Buying a second one just for that sounds idiot to me.
