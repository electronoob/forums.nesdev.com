Scaling up to 16-bit e.g. LSR becomes &quot;LSR x+1; ROR x&quot; introduces inaccuracies once the divisor is greater than 256.  28741 /10 = 2862

Say just using STA, ASL, LSR, ROR, ROL, CLC, SEC, ADC zeropage, ADC immediate, SBC zeropage, sbc immediate, EOR zeropage, EOR immediate. I would propose constraining the routine to 36 bytes or less, and 36 cycles or less because most of the routines I wrote are already shorter than that. I would also constrain it to no more then two temp registers, and preferably just one. If the program could crunch all that then I would try adding in ROL, ROR, ASL, and LSR (all zeropage) next.

Mostly to find short bit-hacks abusing the architecture in some novel way or another. <a href="http://web.stanford.edu/class/cs343/resources/superoptimizer.pdf" class="postlink">Massalin's original paper</a> is a good read, and there is a <a href="http://freecode.com/projects/picsuperoprimizer" class="postlink">PIC16 implementation</a> for instance.<br /><br />There are other other strategies of course but the brute-force method of just generating all permutations from a limited set is workable. They key is to keep the number of opcodes low (counting each immediate and temporary as a distinct instruction) and while for a general-purpose optimize this may not be feasible I'd be more interested in a guided search automate the sort of thing you've been doing by hand here. For instance in the case of division you might first search for roughly the right answer then add in the fudge-factor separately.<br />Note that virtually all generated sequences are completely wrong, so validating them is easy with a couple of well-picked counterexamples. A full-blown theorem prover is only necessary for confirming the final result, if at all.<br /><br />Realistically with, say, 25 opcodes, a bit of pruning and a fast search function you might be able to reach around 12 instructions on a small cluster running overnight.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I glanced at Massalin's paper and that looks like an interesting solution they found for BCD. I will have to read it more later when I have time.<br /><br /><br />I thought more about the computation today. It would be nice to also include ORA and AND, both zeropage and immediate. It's all the immediates that explode the number of states. ADC, SBC, and EOR immediate take 256 states. ORA and AND only need 255 states as you can skip ORA #0 and AND #$FF.<br /><br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">;opcode&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;states<br />; rol&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;1<br />; lsr&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;1<br />; asl&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;1<br />; ror&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;1<br />; clc&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;1<br />; sec&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;1<br />; adc temp&nbsp; &nbsp; 1<br />; sbc temp&nbsp; &nbsp; 1<br />; eor temp&nbsp; &nbsp; 1<br />; and temp&nbsp; &nbsp; 1<br />; ora temp&nbsp; &nbsp; 1<br />; adc #imm&nbsp; &nbsp;256<br />; sbc #imm&nbsp; &nbsp;256<br />; eor #imm&nbsp; &nbsp;256<br />; and #imm&nbsp; &nbsp;255<br />; ora #imm&nbsp; &nbsp;255</div><br /><br />That totals 1289 states. To do 12 instructions would be 1289^12 = 2.1 x 10^37 routines... so pretty heavy. If we skipped all of the immediates then we have a small pool of 11 different states. 11^12 = 2.85 x 10^11 routines, which is doable. I'd much rather run through all the routines and resolve all possible fudge factors at once, but that is some serious computation power needed.<br /><br /><br />For a good initial test value, 255, 238, and 239 are all very good to use. I did a quick excel sheet for calculating the number of unique results for each input (0-255) when dividing by 3 to 31 (skipping divide by 2, 4, 8, and 16). The rightmost column displays the number of unique values for that input.<br /><br /><div class="attachtitle">Attachment:</div><div class="attachcontent">

	</div><br /><br />238 and 239 give the same results for division. More importantly 238 and 255 give unique results for division 3 to 19. This makes it easy to test for initial correctness of the routine with just two checks.

Have the encoder multiply each 16-bit word by 65536/64000 = 128/125 = 1.024, so that the decoder works by <em>multiplying</em> by 40 (shift, shift, add, shift, shift) instead of dividing by 40. The principle is that of arithmetic coding.

I stared at this for a bit and couldn't figure out how it works.  Given &quot;DOG&quot; which encodes to 4, 15, 7, or 4*1600+15*40+7 = 7007, I multiply that *1.024 and wind up with 7175.168.  I don't have the luxury of storing the fractional portion, so iteratively multiplying 7175*40 and dividing by 65536 results in 4, 15, 6.8359375<br /><br />I see where you're going with it, but how does  it translate into an algorithm that yields decodable output?

It would probaby work if more bits were available for the fractions, but in Rad50 they just aren't there.
