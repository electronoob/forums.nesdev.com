		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Awhile back, there was <a href="http://board.byuu.org/viewtopic.php?f=26&amp;t=3379" class="postlink">interest on byuu's forum</a> in decapping the SNES chips.  I was a bit late to the party, but managed to get ahold of a few broken SNES's off of Ebay to donate to the cause, but nobody's taken me up on the offer now that I have them.  Obviously, you don't want fried chips for decapping, so I made sure that the &quot;broken&quot; consoles actually did work before pulling the chips (usually it was a problem with the voltage regulator or a bent pin in the power jack, or just dirty cart pins).  Anyway, I have a couple of full sets of SNES chips I'd be willing to send to somebody if there's anyone around here with the connections to get chips decapped, I'd be willing to send what I have.  I don't have any 1-CHIP CPU's or single-chip S-APU's, but I do have S-CPU/S-PPU1/S-PPU2/S-DSP/S-SMP, 2 sets pulled from SHVC-CPU-01 boards, and I can also pull a set from a SNS-CPU-GMP-01 revision.  I have a couple of other board revisions as well that I haven't been able to get working, but I could always pull the chips and include them anyway.  It's not a whole lot of extra work for me.  Also, if there are any other chips that would be of interest, though I can't think of any other than maybe the DAC, or perhaps the CIC (though I think that's been decapped already, hasn't it?  Or was it just brute-force RE'd?).  Other than that, it's pretty much just the SRAM and WRAM, neither of which are anything special.<br /><br />Anyway, if anybody can get these chips decapped, please let me know and they're all yours, they've been sitting in a box for several months now.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Your biggest obstacle is going to be money.  Unless you find someone that decaps chips who's also interested in the SNES specifically.  But if that were the case it'd probably be done by now.  I'm not certain of the costs, but if you're sending them off to some place that decaps as a business I'd guess you're talking $1000 per chip at least, I wouldn't be surprised if it were several times that.  Might get a discount per chip if you're looking to decap a handful of chips.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />In the thread I linked over at byuu's forum, somebody seemed interested in doing it, and had already contacted somebody else to do the decapping, and was just looking to get their hands on the actual chips.  I got ahold of some and offered them, but never heard back, so I'm just offering them here in case somebody with connections and interest wants to take them off of my hands.  I have neither the money nor the connections, but what I do have is the chips, desoldered and ready to ship, with a few more ready to be desoldered if needed, and I have nothing better to do with them, so they're up for grabs to anybody that wants them.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Talk with Lord Nightmare, his friend is doing the decapping.<br /><br />So far he decapped the S-DSP. Surprise, it's all transistor logic, no embedded CPU + PROM in there.<br /><br />There is, however, a gaussian table. It needed another layer removed to read the bits, so I am still hoping that will happen so we can get a pristine ROM of that to use in emulation. Even if ours is bit-perfect, it's always fun using the literal table from a real system.
