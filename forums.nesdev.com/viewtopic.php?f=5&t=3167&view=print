<br />
<br />That would be cool.  Switchable options like low resolution filter, which basically pixellates the screen 2x2 pixels.
<br />
<br />Palette filter making things be displayed to only the 56(I think) colors NES can do.
<br />
<br />That would be so crazy, but cool.  Maybe a C64 render.

<br />
<br />I got bored and did this.  I mean I know it's not officially correct, like how 8x8 pixel tiles are only limitted to 4 colors, but it's better than nothing.

<br />
<br />There could be a generic converter that took an image and attempted to modify it so that it could look like it was generated by a NES, but it would hardly look like a game actually being played.
<br />
<br />It will just look like a poor image conversion, with dithering, color bleed, and so on, things not usually present in an actual game.
<br />
<br />I think it may be funny to do manual convertions of screens from newer systems like the SNES or the Genesis/Mega Drive just to see how the games could have looked if they were made for the NES, but doing it automatically will just look like crap.

<br />Imagine how much the sprites in <em>Tales of Phantasia</em> would flicker (they already flicker on the SNES sometimes, wich allows 4 times more sprites per line than the NES).

<br />Sure, but I think it's still cool to simulate the existence of ports that never came to be. It's a complete waste of time, of course, so I don't do that anymore.
<br />
<br />NOTE: It may be weird that I say that while using my current avatar, but hopefully, those are not just graphics and I will complete my Sonic game.

<br />There's 8 bit color available on my comp but I can't access it.

<br />On 8 bit color mode, does your computer turn off all the drivers and hardware accelerations when you switch to it manually?

<br />Ha, I'd love to see that. Somari was a neat achievement, but it doesn't really stack up to either the NES SMB games or the Sonic games. (SMW for NES, though...wow. Just wow.)
<br />
<br />Clay Man, 8-bit color, unless the software you're using was designed to run in 8-bit color, just amounts to crappy dithering and piss-poor palette selection.
<br />
<br />I did write something like this once - it converted a 320x200 24-bit raw bitmap into a C= 64 multicolor mode picture (without dithering, just nearest-match color,) but it was quite buggy (it didn't pick colors very well and splattered green all over everything where there wasn't any green to begin with.) One of these days I'll get it whipped into shape...
