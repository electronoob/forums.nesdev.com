Looks right especially with the Vcc match up from the other controllers and everything.  The ground is obvious just based on the cross-hashed area.<br /><br />Do you have a multimeter?  you could always double check that you've got 5v from Vcc and Gnd right before plugging something in.  If it doesn't work as you planned you could try swapping D- and D+ but don't swap anything else.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=4832">infiniteneslives</a> — Thu Jan 19, 2012 9:28 pm</p><hr />

Hey guys, I need some help trying to figure out something.<br /><br />I own a Universal Controller Adapter by a company called Game Elements. This very cool adapter converts Playstation 2 DuelShock, arcade stick or even PS1 controllers (including racing wheels) to work on Xbox, GameCube or Wii. <br /><br /><img src="http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41AA0cM1pQL.jpg" alt="Image" /><br /><br />Today  I just randomly got the idea to take it apart to look at its PCB and I was pleasantly surprised to see an unused but fully present USB trace. I got to thinking that it might be possible to add in a USB cord and have this thing work on a PC or even PS3.  <br /><br />I did some googling and came across a thread where someone else has apparently done just that. <br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://forum.arcadecontrols.com/index.php?topic=26453.0">http://forum.arcadecontrols.com/index.php?topic=26453.0</a><!-- m --><br /><br /><br />I know USB is VCC 5v, GND, + Data and - Data, but my only problem is I'm not really sure where to solder the four wires that will lead to the USB connection. <br /><br />Here are high res images of both sides of the controller adapter pcb. <br /><br />Top side<br /><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/56076975@N02/6727683971/" class="postlink"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7017/6727683971_27635a663e_b.jpg" alt="Image" /></a><br /><br />Bottom side<br /><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/56076975@N02/6727681305/" class="postlink"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7007/6727681305_15931f8b41_b.jpg" alt="Image" /></a><br /><br /><br />I also know the Xbox Controller pinout closely mirrors USB. <br /><img src="http://mesh.typepad.com/hacks/xbox/usb_adapter/expansion_adapter.gif" alt="Image" /><br /><br />This matches up nicely with the colors of the wires on the Xbox side of the adapter being Gray, Black, Yellow, Green, White Red. <br /><br />I'm not sure why there's a Gray line, but it's bridged by solder with the Black and another connection for GameCube, so I assume that indicates those three traces all must be GND. <br /><br />Further googling I found this in a tutorial on how to modify an Xbox 1 Controller to be a pure USB controller: <br /><br /><img src="http://www.stlflops.com/techemporium/xboxctrl/XBox-Pin-Outs-2.JPG" alt="Image" /><br /><br />Based on all this, I think I know where to solder the USB cable wires, but I'm a little unsure. This is what I'm thinking: <br /><br /><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/56076975@N02/6728220817/" class="postlink"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7019/6728220817_bf0130019a_b.jpg" alt="Image" /></a><br /><br /><br />Can anyone with more experience chime in and offer some help? The last thing I want to is hook up VCC somewhere incorrectly and have the thing die on me.<br /><br />Thanks.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=4236">SatoshiMatrix</a> — Thu Jan 19, 2012 5:09 pm</p><hr />
