<br />
<br />1: It basically turns 6502 ROM format into 6502 or 68k. But for it to be better, as well as accurate, It requires work. I do know how VB works, So I could let someone do something about it. As it cuts code improperly, and it is a bug.
<br />
<br />2: I already know that I must recode the video, audio, and more if I port SMB to genesis. I have some code and programs from Romhacking.net and a few genesis dev sites that can be used.
<br />
<br />3: It was by Orbit2002, But he went away (Might be no more interest in NESdev?)

Sure, the attribute tables differ (one attribute per tile, like the GBC and SNES, not for every 2x2 block of tiles) and the pattern table format differs (4-bit packed, like the GBA, not 2-bit planar).

<br />
<br />I know the VDP has a video mode with a resolution that's 256 pixels wide (in addition to the more common 320), and I think you can set the height to 240, making the screen the same size as in the PPU. The name tables (don't remember if they're called that), however, can't be 30 tiles tall, it has to be 32 or 64. Not really a problem for a side scroller. It supports sprites of various sizes, from 8x8 to 32x32, so there is no problem in using 8x8 or 8x16. I'm not really sure how it handles sprite priorities, but I know that each background tile can be in front or behind of them, something the NES doesn't have. That's all I can think of right now. At least for SMB, it seems pretty doable without many modifications.
<br />
<br />EDIT: Although a direct conversion seems possible from a graphical point of view, if the game is going to look the same, what's the point?

<br />Why would anyone want to develop on the Genesis?  You can count the games with good music on one bollock.

<br />
<br />Tokumaru: I want it converted because the Genesis has better features, But I cannot do it on the SNES, Because it is hard to know how to put certain tiles (Status bar, Tiles, etc) in the SNES's PPU (Layer Related) and the Genesis is a little better anyways. As for the SNES's sound, It is kinda hard to create.
<br />
<br />Anyone: If anyone wants recode the SMB disassembly for me, and I can create Graphics (and optionally Maps and Sound). and turn it to a accurate conversion, Please PM me.

<br />It'd be the opposite of your Somari sequel: to show how much effort an NES-&gt;Genesis port would involve. A few plug-and-play TV games are known to use a Genesis-on-a-chip. Or to try an All-Stars style graphical upgrade. Or to provide enough space in the palette to get Mario+Luigi co-op going, just as Sonic 2 has Sonic+Tails.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I just checked again and it seems like I was wrong about the display size... well, kinda... only in PAL you can have 240 scanlines, in NTSC, apparently, the closest you can get to the NES is 256x224. This would still probably work pretty well, since NES games shouldn't have anything interesting in the top and bottom 8 scanlines. In this mode you can use 64 sprites, exactly what's needed to mimic the NES.
<br />
<br />The best playfield size to emulate vertical mirroring would be 64x32 tiles, I guess. Something I didn't mention before was palettes... There are 4 of them each one with 16 colors. One could probably use the first 4 colors of each palette for the BG and the following 4 for the sprites. The patterns would have to be further adjusted for this, but in the end it would work pretty much like the NES.
<br />
<br />Oh, and the priority control for sprites works pretty much like we're used to. The tiles of each background plane also have priority control, but if those are left untouched it should work like the NES. There are horizontal and vertical flipping bits too.

The only real problem I found, PPUxVDP-wise, is that you can't have a 30-tile tall name table. This would be a problem if there was any vertical scrolling involved, which is not the case of SMB though.<br /><br />I just had an idea though... since the NES has only one BG layer while the MD has 2, it should be possible to have both be 32-tile tall and have them aligned as if they were 30-tile tall, each one simulating a name table. Using transparent tiles on the 2 unused rows should do the trick.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">A few plug-and-play TV games are known to use a Genesis-on-a-chip.

<br />I see. However, in the case of graphical updates, mapping PPU features directly into VDP features is not all that important, since the graphics will be redone anyway you could very well redesign them to make better use of all the features.

<br />True, but it's also useful to establish an effort-improvement curve. For example, it takes <em>x</em> effort to make a 1:1 port, or <em>x+y</em> effort to add this kind of enhancement, or...
