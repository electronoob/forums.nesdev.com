<br />
<br />Ok since I have been screwin around with MAME for the last couple of days I decided I would get out my old topfighter that I have not took out in many years.
<br />here is a link to some pictures of one I found, it actually has a nice arcadey feel to it.

<br />
<br />Anyway I have been having some trouble with it.
<br />
<br />on the small lcd screen it displays every button you press and it will display what button sequences is being mimicked when you press a macro button. If I press L,X,R,Y,B,A or any direction on the joystick, the lcd displays the button press normally but, when I open up the joystick controls on my computer it shows one button stuck on auto turbo mode (possibly should be start and I have "slow motion" turned on) that button would be B but not a single one of the buttons dose what its suppose to and if you hold any of them down it show as if its being pressed rapidly.
<br />
<br />I have it connected to a snes to gamecube/wii converter then plugged into a gamecube to usb converter, an original snes controller works just fine like this. Maybe its possible the topfighter have greater power requirements and that why its malfunctioning? or perhaps there is something wrong? idk, anybody have experience with one of these?
<br />
<br />edit: plugged it into my wii and its doin the same thing, next up real snes.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />problem found, its workin fine on the real SNES and no good with the retrousb to wii adapter.
<br />
<br />how would one go about modifying it so that it would work?
<br />
<br />The topfighter is recognized as a regular SNES controller, so would it be the adapter dose not meet its power requirements or something else?
<br />
<br />Anybody maybe have an adapter that is working with one?

<br />
<br />I doubt its the lack of power so I didn't bother tryin. I have some MCU's , I may try reading the controllers output  and try to make my own if I ever feel motivated enough but that is doubtful.
<br />
<br />would be easyer to just rig something to the buttons, that way I could also use the macro buttons as regular buttons but i dont wanna

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Unrelated: You stated in the referenced post/thread/URL that you weren't sure if the pushbuttons used in that joystick were arcade parts.  As someone who owns a Candy 25 unit, I can confirm that they are arcade pushbuttons, though I can't tell the size.  That includes the plastic nuts/screws that hold the buttons in place and everything.  If you ever need to replace them, check out <a href="http://www.lizardlick.com/Pushbuttons_c_138.html" class="postlink">Lizard Lick</a> or Happ Controls for parts.  I've bought from Lizard Lick on a couple of occasions and can vouch for their reliability.
