But I will agree, this is what you'd want to use for bass (I always have square melodies and triangular bass lines). I guess using the DCM for bass is also an option. I've heard some pretty good bass come out of that on Nerd Tracker...</div>
<br />
<br />Yeah, the DPCM can work pretty good for bass.  I had a lot of songs that had the triangle+DPCM both playing the same thing (except drums would interrupt the triangle, or in a couple songs, the DPCM).
<br />
<br />For me it worked out pretty well to use headphones when writing music, I could hear it a lot better.  I'd assume there's always going to be someone who has speakers 100X better than what I'm using, heheh, and that's where you want it to sound good.  Seems like I recall being pretty happy with the triangle channel alone for bass, with headphones at least, but it's been a while since I've done any sound stuff really..
<br />
<br />Recca is one example, where they muted the triangle channel by setting it to the lowest frequency rather than silence it.  Haha, I think kevtris had fixed that "bug" when the NSF was ripped.  That's a pretty extreme example, but shows how bad the problem can be if you can't hear properly.

<br />The stuff I wrote/covered on nsf was all done on headphones, with a nice pair of headphones in mind.

<br />
<br />For me, their DPCM samples tend to sound a lot better with headphones...I've always been a sucker for clarity and usually, even on tracked songs, tend to kill any filters...mabye it's just somthing about noise from the compression that I like...Then again I've personally found that using stereoizer and bandpass effects on the square-waves tend to help quite a bit to prevent that harmonic ringing that goes straight to your head...that and listening at lower levels on better headphones(of course).

That means switched duty cycles - when I hear the "correct" sound, it was all "wrong". <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /> Anyway, I believe the 50% duty cycle is responsible for some uncomfortable tunes with headphones. 
<br />
<br />- General approach: I love NES music. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /> and mm10 music too.

<br />
<br />Well I'd imagine square waves being able to harm your ears since it pushes your eardrums really fast back in forth.
<br />
<br />
<br />On topic: It sounds fine to me when I listen to it with my nice stereo bass headphones.

Yeah, not a good idea! I ended up with some obnoxious tones in my ear that actually made me feel weird to listen to. After a while, I concluded there were health risks involved if I didn't take off my headphones <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />.<br /><br />But besides that, I have listened to NSFs with headphones, and I agree they sound pretty bad. One reason NES music might sound horrible on headphones is the complete lack of bass. It seems like all songs just have no power or meaning behind them, like there's a bunch of sound missing from what's heard. And I don't know, I just feel so awkwardly embraced by mathematics when I hear NES music on headphones; it just sounds so calculated and unnatural. If that makes any sense...</div>
<br />
<br />I agree, very 'tin-ney' sound and no bass

I mean I think I understand some of the complaints mentioned here (not bassy 'enough', etc), but perhaps I've just been used to the sound and it hasn't really bothered me.
<br />
<br />I do have a set of earbuds that it sounds really muffled through, but that's all music and not just NES music. Everything sounds fine to me through these-
