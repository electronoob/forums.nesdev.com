You could begin with BASIC, C#, python, 6502 assembly language, z80 assembly, NES specific 6502 assembly... either way, you'll learn something.<br /><br />Something as literal as assembly language might actually be easier to understand than a very high level language. There's little or no hiding what the code actually does. <br /><br />Learning how to use the command line is super useful and most likely necessary at some point, but you *can* assemble a nes program without it, for example using asm6.exe's drag and drop feature.

However doing a Win32 application is not a necessary step for coding on the NES, but it'll help in developing your own tools when a specific tool is lacking in what already exist. For example I had to use my own tool to compress my levels in my game.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">Just out of curiosity: What do you dislike so much about C?</div><br />Can't speak for him, but there's plenty of things <em>I</em> dislike about C. Making an explicit list wouldn't be terribly useful, as you can probably get a lot of C langauge critisism by searching the internet. However my major gripes are :<br /><ul><li>The necessary of ; to terminate statements</li><li>The abundance of symbols like { } [ ] which are easy to reach on an american keyboard but hard and annoying to reach on a german-style keyboard like we have here</li><li>The necessity to either declare function in headers before you use them or have them in a specific, un-intuitive &quot;declare-before-use&quot; order</li><li>Case sensitive labels/variables</li><li>The type system is retarded, the size of an int is unknown cannonically so you have to use weird crap using SIZEOF. Yes in &quot;modern&quot; C we can use types like uint16_t and know their size but they don't come naturally.</li><li>The way pointers/arrays are declared and used is FUCKING RETARDED</li><li>C-strings impose a format of zero-terminated strings when you would want to use otherwise (for example, $ff terminated or having the length as a header)</li><li>Inability to call arguments by value (bad)</li><li>The confusion between = and == symbols is constantly annoying</li><li>Memory management is a headache</li><li>The &quot;*&quot; symbol can mean 3 different thing, the &quot;const&quot; keyword is annoying and the &quot;static&quot; keyword can have 3 completely different meanings, all of them very poorly described by the word &quot;static&quot;.</li></ul><br />None of this prevents me to use C and write C programs, but that doesn't change I do not like the language very much.<br />Actually while writing a program in both assembly or C is not particularly hard per se, I find understanding C code I wrote 5 years ago again typically much harder than assembly code I wrote 5 years ago, ironically. But this depends on a case-per-case basis.

Since these are symbols that are normally never used in Swedish writings, they are placed so they require the AltGr key to be held instead of shift. But in programming they are used all the time, which gets really tiresome. Same goes for other symbols that requires AltGr including @, $, £, \, ~ and |, but they are not used as often as {[]} so they are usually fine. The exception is $ which is used all the time in 6502 assembly as hexadecimal notation. I'm just glad that semicolon (also never used in Swedish writings) is easy to type, it only requires holding shift. But GNU ARM assembler apparently uses @ for comments, what a nightmare!!

'@' is relatively easy to access because we can use AltGr with our right hand wile typing '2' with our left hand. However the []{} needs to type both AltGr and the corresponding key with the right hand, which is very tiresome.<br /><br />Actually I'm seriously considering switching to Pascal or Python language as a &quot;default&quot; programming language JUST to get rids of the brackets.
