It could pass for an original NES title.<br /><br />I know your engine isn't finished, but it would be so great to be able to see the visuals on a ROM through the real hardware with the PPU's unique filter. Just a taste is all I ask, just a taste... lol

So Nintendo likely had the audio lines cut out so that they could be re-connected just for the FDS, and not for anyone else.  It sounds kind of odd putting it that way, but considering Nintendo was very controlling of their console, it wouldn't be surprising that Nintendo did that so that they could maximize their cartridge profits.</div><br />Er, think about this: how would you connect the FDS into the VCR-style cartridge slot?

May put the audio lines there as well, especially if it would have helped designing or manufacturing the hardware.

So if you do manage to memorize it on one, you've memorized it for all three.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Given that they put the audio mix on the NES's expansion connector, and they only reserved 10 pads, and the cable from the FDS base to the drive itself is 11 conductors, two of which are power and ground... I guess they could have done it that way. (q.v. electronics junkers' RE'd schematic: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://green.ap.teacup.com/junker/119.html">http://green.ap.teacup.com/junker/119.html</a><!-- m --> )<br /><br />Seems a little weird to me to have deliberately decided to route audio through the expansion connector twice, but it's pointless to second-guess now.
