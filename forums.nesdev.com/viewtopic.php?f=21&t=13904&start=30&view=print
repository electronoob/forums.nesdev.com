It's not like the game's running most of the physics while you're running on that spiral....though I suppose you might want to spoof the BG by the sides with sprites so you DON'T have to update attribute tables either...

Honestly though, if we're going by Team Somari's standards, they'd probably just make those stationary, or replace the whole thing with zig-zag ramps or something.<br /><br />It is a stupid gimmick that doesn't add much to the gameplay anyway, there's no point in jumping through hoops to get it implemented exactly like the original.

Personally I'd probably give up on the original thickness, and just do a platform 7-pixels thick, which at the given slope of 1/4 pixels would have a lot of headroom against flickering.

Also on the background tiles there was one colour too many, a very dark teal.<br /><br />And I switched to the Joel Y NTSC palette.<br /><br /><img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/15588722/post/nesdev/sonic_edit.png" alt="Image" />

Basically, you'd have to recreate every tile as a combination of background and foreground tiles, every frame, on the fly.<br /><br />Also, would be 1000x easier, if done on SNES.
