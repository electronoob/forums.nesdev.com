<br />And myself I wouldn't be stopped to do GBdev or GBCdev even if the GBA came out. They're quite different console. I'd take GBC over GB, beacuse it has color and more WRAM, but the GBA is a totally different console, as the SNES is totally different with the NES.
<br />If nobody would be interested in coding for less advenced systems, nobody would do NESdev and everyone here would try to desesperatly reverse engineer the Playstation 2.
<br />
<br />On the other hand, I have the impression than doing a commercial quality NES game from scratch is much easier than doing a commercial quality Playstaion 2 game from scratch.

<br />Yeah, in fact, we're all into NESDEV because we like the advanced stuff ourselves.
<br />
<br />Seriously, they are completely different platforms (GB/GBC x GBA). A person can easily prefer the GB/GBC architecture over the GBA one, just as we might pick the NES over the SNES, for example.

If that's the usual way of doing things, people would probably go to whichever system has the best libraries/performance and not care about the architecture as much.

<br />And honestly, while I like my old Gameboy, the screen quality with all the blurring is total crap.

<br />Older GB games and some GBC games are very good. Too many of the later GBC games were total crap. I guess people were not used to coding for 8-bit systems anymore.
<br />
<br />As for the console, the original was indeed very green and blurry. The pocket version was a little better, it was actually B&amp;W, but still a bit blurry. The GBC screen was pretty good, but you still have to play on a bright place to get decent contrast/colors. I still have my pocket and GBC. I think someday I'll buy a GBA, when it gets really cheap.
<br />
<br />IMO, the best games are in B&amp;W.

<br />Fortunately things are fixed now.
<br />The GBASP screen is pretty good because it has its built-in light. When playing with sun-light instead, it can often become annoying because it works less good, and the built-in light won't change that at all. So if you have the choise between a dark place and use the light, or a light place and don't use the light, I'd rather pick the dark place unless I'm afraid the battery goes out too quickly or something.
<br />The original GBA had a screen better suited to play in light places, if I remember correctly, but in the dark you simply couldn't play.
<br />
<br />Tokumaru : Wich game(s) are you talking about of being so bad on the GBC ? My Dragon Warrior III card was extremly good, way better than the NES version even if both are technically 8-bit. I think aside of some Pokémon and Zelda games, GBC only games aren't here in a very big quantity. For the most part, they are GB/GBC compatible.

<br />I know about the lists of links there. I looked, but I didn't see one of them being an active forum. Specifically the ezboard is nuked, and a lot of the domains have expired and become generic ad domains.
<br />
<br />One major reason I started this topic was to find a new home for nensondubois, who seems to be more interested in GB than NES.

The SNES has only emulator devloppement communauty, and the GB seems to have really few things, as opposed to the NES and the GBA where there is considerable developpement communauties.
<br />
<br />I was also asking that question to myself, and there is almost no insteresting GB technical doccument on zophear. The few doccument doesn't really describe the whole architecture of the Game Boy. The only thing I know about the GB it that is has a Z80 CPU. It also has the four analog sound channels present on the GBA.
