<br />Not only that, but you also have to make sure all your frame calculations end before the sprite hit <span style="text-decoration: underline">every single frame</span>, or else the status bar will jump/flicker. In a platformer, with all the flow of enemies showing up and leaving/dying, I think it's pretty safe to assume that there will be an occasional CPU-intensive frame, and I'm sure you don't want the status bar to glitch up in that case.
<br />
<br />Status bars at the bottom of the screen are only 100% safe with IRQs. Are you against placing the bar at the top of the screen? Those can be safely implemented without the aid of mappers or interrupts (well... technically the NMI is required, but you should be using NMIs anyway).

Right?</div><br />I wouldn't want to rely on mapper IRQs while no NES cart publisher (is RetroZone is the only one?) has a mapper with that feature.<br /><br />For a status bar at the top of the screen, here's what you have to do: after the usual graphical updates, set the scroll to display the status bar and prepare a sprite 0 hit for a location near the end of the status bar (which is easy, because the status bar doesn't move). Then wait for the sprite hit flag to be cleared (from the previous frame's hit) and then wait for it to be set again. You can do other tasks before these waits, as long as you're sure they'll finish before the sprite hit (the sound engine would be a good thing to run during this time, for example). Once the hit happens, you just have to set the scroll for the gameplay area using $2005/$2006 trickery (example code <a href="http://nesdev.com/bbs/viewtopic.php?p=64111#64111" class="postlink">here</a>).<br /><br />This will work either in an NMI handler or in the main loop (in case you use NMIs just to set a flag indicating that VBlank started), but it's obviously better to use the NMI handler, because they deal with lag frames gracefully, without visual side effects.<br /><br />BTW, I was peeking at your code and it seems you have an NMI handler, but for some reason you trash X by reading from a variable and comparing its value to $02, but soon after you save A to the stack. If you had a lag frame, trashing X like that would be very bad. You should probably use A to check that variable instead, after having backed it up to the stack (and obviously restore it before RTI'ing). Or better yet, if you can use bits 6 and 7 to represent the states you need, you can use the BIT instruction, which doesn't trash any registers, and use BPL/BMI and BVC/BVS to make decisions based on those bits.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">What mappers would a company like Retrozone be able to reproduce without costs being excessive?</div>
<br />I think they have basically two boards: one that can be configured for most discrete logic mappers (NROM, CNROM, UxROM, AxROM) and another for various MMC1 configurations. Those are your safe bets, but some people say that a good MMC3 game might just be the incentive RetroZone needs to develop an MMC3 clone and board. Personally, I wouldn't risk it.

<br />I can think of one hedge. Develop two versions of your game, one for MMC1 and one for MMC3, with extra features in the MMC3 version. With good architecture, they should be able to share most of the source tree.

<br />
<br />Edit: As for your game working fine during a lag frame, if tokumaru's description is correct, it only worked because the NMI was called in the middle of a routine where the value of X wasn't expected to be something. If that happened in the middle of a loop that used X and X was changed by the NMI, bad things would (probably) happen.

<br />Yes, but only 4 KiB at a time. Are you animating a lot of background tiles? There may be a workaround.

<br />So you have to switch all of the graphics at once with MMC1?
<br />
<br />I'm not sure if I will want to animate any, I just though it would be a nice thing to have available if I needed an extra aesthetic touch.

<br />
<br />I don't know if anyone else has one, but I finished the Verilog for one, I'm 95% sure it will work as-is, but I haven't made the board layout yet.  I used the smallest (36 macrocell) CPLD and one 74xx part to provide the inputs needed for the IRQ logic.  I have some projects ready to use this board, so this will be moving along before too long.
<br />
<br />IRQ operation has 2 modes.  Both are PPU-based - based on sprite and/or background tile placement.  One mode triggers an IRQ (acknowledge register clears it).  The other mode will automatically bankswitch the CHR to your latched value (acknowledge register resets it to a 'fixed' bank).  The only catch is that in the latter mode, the NES CPU must keep IRQs disabled.  CHR page size is 2kB.
