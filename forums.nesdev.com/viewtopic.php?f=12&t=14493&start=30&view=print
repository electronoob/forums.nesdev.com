We are referring to the Satellaview base unit, correct? The expansion port audio pins do connect to an op-amp (U9 - LM324) on the PCB. Left channel (Expansion port 27) is connected to pin 14 of U9 through some RC-type circuit. Right channel (Expansion port 28) is on pin 1 of U9 in a similar fashion. Both op-amps configured as buffers. Haven't traced where inputs of op-amps go to yet.

Did you comapre the LM324 wiring to SNES mainboard schematic? It's having LM324, too (with each channel having two opamp's in series, in lack of knowing a better name, I've called them &quot;pre-amp&quot; and &quot;post-amp&quot;).<br /><br />The opamp wired &quot;as buffer&quot; means that it has OUT and IN- shortcut with each other? That would be same as for the &quot;pre-amp&quot; on the mainboard (and makes sense since that satellaview &quot;pre-amp&quot; signal is then mixed with the snes &quot;pre-amp&quot; signal; and then passed to the &quot;post-amp&quot; on the snes mainboard).<br /><br />On the SNES, the pre-amp's IN+ pin is wired via three 22K resistors (=66K) to the DAC's audio output. In the satellaview unit it's probably wired to the 64pin or 100pin chip. Ah, and/or... it might also go to one of the six &quot;???&quot; pins on the 38pin CN2 connector.<br /><br />PS. just curious, as the LM324 is a quad opamp, and needing only two opamp's for the stereo audo... are the other two opamp's used for something, too?

That forum thread you linked, it appears the conclusion is that the data going into the Satellaview base unit from the BS tuner is simply 1s and 0s (as far as the physical characteristics of the signal). My original concern was that the signal going into the Satellaview receiver was not demodulated entirely (being that the tuner would bring the signal down to some intermediate frequency, then pass this to other devices). I came to this conclusion as I noticed the Satellaview had a voltage controlled oscillator, something that is often used in a PLL circuit in radio receivers (I have limited knowledge on the subject, just remember from DSP and Telecomm. theory courses I took at one point).<br /><br />Speaking of the 668kbps bit rate, it seems that this is <em>nearly</em> half of the bit rate used in the audio signal transmission (1.35 Mbps / 2 = 675 kbps). Not sure if there is any relation, just thought I would state an observation.
