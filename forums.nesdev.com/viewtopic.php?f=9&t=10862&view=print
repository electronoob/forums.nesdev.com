		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Hello there, kind of new to all of this.<br /><br />I wanted to make a couple of repos and found the Kazoo hardware, which simplifies the whole process entirely. I picked up the programmer a month or so ago and managed to make a repo just fine without many issues. <br /><br />I ordered a NES-SGROM board from them and recently got it, with the flash upgrade option; 256 PRG-ROM for CHR-RAM boards option. I got it in the mail today and followed the instructions as followed in the text file included via your site and made sure to erase the chips with the header option before installing anything. Well I burnt the file I needed (I only had the .bin file, no chr file with this one) and it burnt okay, but the cart refuses to boot up, I usually just get a yellow screen and on the off chance it did boot up, the screen was garbled and froze right away. <br /><br />I tried to erase and re-burn the file, but the Kazoo keeps giving me an error-116, no matter what I try. Any ideas? Is there a chance that it's the PCB itself, like it's damaged or was made wrong?<br /><br />Edit: I re-installed the Kazoo and now I've managed to get it to write the header, or what I assume it is, it tests okay and it installs and verifies that it wrote the header, but then the light goes from red to blank and when I try to go and write the 256kb .bin to the chip(s), it's still giving me a 116 error. I've looked around a little bit online and there's barely any information about this or the problems I am having online.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I'm not an expert, but I have seen the '116' after I do something incorrect <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /> Try to reboot the Kazzo to reset the firmware. <br />I ran into minor confusion with the wrong 'erase' header ( was the original Anago erase file) or when I had the boot loader switch wrong. <br />Do double check to make sure:<br />1. You have INL's firmware flashed to Kazzo if you'r using the INL GUI<br />2. BL switch to Run<br />3. INL Erase header for installed Flash size, LED will extinguish after erase. EDIT-Rather, PRG erase for a CHR ram board and PRG/CHR erase for a CHR flash board.<br />4. PRG/CHR file size same as Flash chips installed. 128K PRG for 128K Flash chip, or 256K PRG for a 256K Flash.<br />If there is an error at any point, reboot the Kazzo and start over. If I try to continue without, I get error 116. It might help to re-seat the board in the Kazzo connector, a little to the left or right, but with my INL boards they seem snug and don't shift. I have also found that my USB hub slowed things down and/or causes errors, try USB cable direct to PC.<br />I'm sure INL will give more insight, but maybe some of these points might help?<br />Yogi

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />1. Not only did I try flashing it and trying the &quot;old&quot; software included with the archive, but I re-flashed it to work with INL GUI.<br />2. I think by default it's set to RUN, even if it wasn't, by re-flashing it twice and trying to burn, it's set to RUN, I double checked myself.<br />3. Okay that's good to know, because it does that. Thanks. The documentation for it is pretty sparse. <br />4. I am well aware that they need to be the same size and may need to be padded as necessary. In this case the ROM I am trying to burn only has a .PRG file, splitting it does not yeild a .CHR file.<br /><br />I have been rebooting it each time I get an error and restarted. I have tried re-seating the PCB board multiple times. I am not using a USB hub, but a direct connection. At this point I am wondering if I was given the wrong size chips. My order says it should have been for MMC1: PRG-ROM: 256KB (for CHR-RAM boards). Is there any marking on the chips themselves to see the sizes? Would the software tell me the file is too big or just give me another error?

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />OK the basics are covered, I know that all the above is covered in the read-me but sometimes restating helps. <br /> To check the size of the flash chip: look for the rectangular chip marked with SST in large print; below that print you should see smaller print that reads 39SF020. this is the flash rom. The '020 is a 256K device; 010 would be a 128K and 040 would be a 512K. <br /> Seeing how you have already flashed a different repo board, the Kazzo hardware should be good, as well as you software install. So this leaves either the flash board or a problem with the ROM file. Have you tested the ROM in a EMU? I assume yes, so you may want to PM INL.<br />Yogi<br />EDIT Just a thought, did you strip the header out of the ROM file, for just a .PRG bin file? Even though it has no CHR file embedded in the NES ROM, the header needs to be removed with Uconn64 or readNES.

I e-mailed them yesterday, but came here too, hoping for maybe a faster resolution. If I don't hear from them in a few days I'll send INL a message on here. I don't want to nag them too much, it just sucks when you get something in the mail and you can't get the *#&amp;$er to work.

I would get another error code and if I retried without resetting I would get 116. <br />If you had a hint of the game's screens at one point, some code was flashed. The issue could be the hardware mangling the bits in some way or the bin file itself. <br /> For hardware problems these are the things I look at first: make sure the edge connector is clean; all the handling of the bare board could cause issues. Are you confident about your NES' 72 pin connector? <br /> Your NES' connector wouldn't have any impact with flashing the cart in the first place, but the cart edge would. If the PC software and AVR firmware are operating correct then the cart should work. The only issue I have had with the few boards I have flashed has been operator errors.<br /> It's my understanding that INL tests his boards, so there is a lower probability of the error there, but it's not impossible. I can't speak for  INL, but I believe he will do his best to help you. There is contact info in the readme that you may want to use.<br /> Not sure what else I could add...<br />Yogi

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />The 72 pin connector has been recently cleaned and boiled. every single game in my library plays without any hitch and without even pressing down upon.<br /><br />To be honest the first rom I burnt to a PCB, I didn't bother stripping the header and it worked perfectly fine. I didn't even think of it until I read the text file after the second rom I tried to burn didn't work properly. I mean even in the guides for the standard procedure (soldering, donor carts, burning roms) it never mentions anything about stripping the header, just splitting the rom. <br /><br />I mean, you can say it's user error, but I don't know what I am doing wrong. I stick the thingy in the thing, make sure the chips are erased and then try to burn the PRG file, all according to the text read me included with the software. I did it once without any issues so I don't know what I'd be doing wrong this time around.<br /><br />I assumed the upgraded flash chips would allow me to re-flash the board as needed, maybe I am wrong. But I thought even old chips could be re-used several times by using a UV eraser to clear them. <br /><br />It's most likely my fault, but with so little documentation on it, it's hard to even know what's going on. I am gonna wait till Friday and if I don't get a e-mail response through their site, I'll contact them here. The text file has a phone number, but honestly I don't want to call them up. That just seems rude.

The entire erasing part goes exactly as you state it should, but as soon as I go to write the PRG file, I always error out. I have tried multiple files, I have tried files with stripped headers, I have tried resetting the programmer, re-installing the drivers, plugging and unplugging the hardware. I cannot get it to write the file.

I was actually saying a old guide for solder method from another site did not say anything about the header. Sorry for the confusion.<br /><br />As far as doing what you've asked, I'll do it when I get home, as I'm at work right now, but looking at the anago software looks a tad confusing.<br /><br />I'm also thinking about trying on another computer just to see what happens. Computers can be so fickle some times.<br /><br />On a side note, have you considered updating the software for the flash chips to allow for a drag and drop interface, one that'd let you directly see what's on the chips like a more triditional flash drive or something?

I wonder if something happened that caused different results?<br /><br />I managed to erase the chips, although to be honest I did it several times in a row just to ensure I properly erased them. I burned a PRG to the chips and the game still came up garbled. I tried the online software recommended to strip the header out, still got the same results, I tried a different rom, and I got the same results, garbled graphics. <br /><br />Now I will be the first to admit I am completely new to this sort of thing, but I did manage to make a repo that had a .PRG and .CHR file just fine, the first time through, since there is nothing to burn a .CHR file to, assumed that all I did was write the .PRG file and call it good, is there something else you have to do to files that lack both the .PRG and .CHR files? <br /><br />All of my other games work, the 72 pin connector was recently scrubbed clean, bent pins and then boiled, so I doubt it's that and the pins on the PCB are in good shape too. <br /><br />Paul went ahead and e-mailed me asking for close ups of the board, so I sent him some pics after work. I'll keep people updated on what's going on and if it gets resolved. Thanks for everyone that tried to help.  <img src="./images/smilies/Mfr_icon_homebrew.png" alt=":beer:" title="Beer" />
