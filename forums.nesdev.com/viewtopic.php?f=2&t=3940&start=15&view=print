<br />
<br />Why this new format with Marty and BootGod in command? Because many in the community want to get rid of that piece of junk called header embedded with the binaries. We wished emulators to be able to run raw binaries without any addition. Besides, this format allows to integrate a lot more infos that any header could, in human readable format.
<br />
<br />FAQ:
<br />
<br />Q:Which emulator will support that?
<br />A:Nestopia, and hopefully more eventually
<br />
<br />Q:Who will maintain the Database?
<br />A:BootGod, so that you never run again a rom with a wrong mapper/herdaer
<br />
<br />Q:Are the new roms going to be easy to find?
<br />A:All you need to do is batch remove headers with uCON64. And yes, they will be available rather easily.

<br />
<br />But there is no reason the emulated rom cant still be ines (1 or 2), and then you add the exact same zip folder that contains the more detailed hardware description and artwork.  ines is good enough for the emulator to play the game, so mapper info shouldn't be lumped in with other info when it just adds complexity.  Keeping ines doesn't in any way restrict you from having and preserving those box/manual/label art files.  Your new xml could even just say "use that ines rom" instead of "use that bin file" to keep everything backwards compatible.

<br />But iNES is EV1L!!!11!! We must be cleansed of it! But really, that'd be perfect, because then any emulators which can open iNES files embedded in a .zip would work already.

I remember hearing some weird cartridges, which were probably pirate/unlicensed, didn't work with the iNES format cause of weird things they did or something like that. I agree that nothing will replace iNES headered NES roms unless it is backwards compatible. Even then you'll always have to support the old format.</div>
<br />The technical problem with INES is ambiguity.  You cannot distinguish between MMC3 and MMC6 (both of which are mapper 4), nor can you disable WRAM explicitly (there's always 8K implied).  Some mappers (such as 185) cannot be accurately emulated without additional info which isn't in the INES spec.  You cannot declare WRAM sizes smaller than8K, nor can you declare battery-backed CHR-RAM.  There's no room for VS system info, and there's no way to identify a ROM as being both NTSC and PAL.  Most of these problems (if not all) can be resolved by adopting the kevtris' NES 2.0 specification, but without a reliable tool for performing the update in a database-guided manner, that spec will never go anywhere.
<br />
<br />Further problems arise in the way actual ROMs are encoded.  Many ROMs have simply bad headers, and those that have "good" headers almost never have the WRAM and PAL fields set properly.  Even the battery RAM bit isn't reliable in my experience.  These problems wouldn't be an issue if a reliable ROM fixer were available, but AFAIK there is none.

Perhaps not as human readable -- but emulators aren't human, so that's not really a big selling point in my book.  If you want a human-readable database -- make a webpage (like BootGod's).  ROM binaries should be just that -- a binary.<br /><br />I'm looking at this format from a practicality standpoint... and I keep asking myself these questions:<br /><br />1)  does this format make the <em>emulator</em> more functional?<br />2)  Will end users really be looking at these XML files in a text editor?<br /><br />I certainly don't see #1 being the case.  And there might be a few people interested in the #2 feature -- but again those people would (or should) be just as satisfied with a seperate source (like BootGod's site).  Either way -- the additional workload that's passed on the emulator here, and the complication involved overwhelmingly outweighs these benefits, IMO.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">Q:Who will maintain the Database?<br />A:BootGod, so that you never run again a rom with a wrong mapper/herdaer<br /></div><br /><br />This is what gets me.<br /><br />NEStopia has had a ROM database like forever... and it's worked well.  I was planning on implimenting a database feature in my emu as well -- but stored externally so that it could be modified by others and updated without having to build a new binary.<br /><br /><em>Here</em>, a text based, human readable format is understandable (and even a good idea).  But is it really necessary to gut the ROM binaries, make a new format, and compromise backwards compatibility to do this?  Of course it's not.  NEStopia has been doing just fine for years -- I don't see why all of the sudden these databasing techniques aren't good enough any more.<br /><br />KISS.  XML is not simple or even easy to work with.  Hell, it's not even the easiest text based format for a human to read.  There's all this additional complication here... and really... how will anybody be better off?<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">Q:Are the new roms going to be easy to find?<br />A:All you need to do is batch remove headers with uCON64.

<br />
<br />More proof of my point.
<br />
<br />If a conversion can be done with a tool -- then why can't this conversion be done internally by NEStopia?  Why the new format?  It just doesn't make sense to me.
<br />
<br />Hundred bucks says NEStopia will still even do these kinds of conversions and database lookups even after this new format is supported (because of the large userbase still using iNES ROMs).  So really... what's the point?

But ROM Hackers and other people that edit ROMs and headers would (hopefully) be familiar enough with hex editors and other such tools so that on the off and somewhat rare occasion they'd need to actually edit a header in a way that existing tools don't already provide an interface for, they'd still be able to so with minimal difficulty.<br /><br />Besides.. if you want to talk about editing efficiency... a new format that is completely incompatible with existing mainstream patching systems is riddled with problems.

I think we'd be relying on them just as much as we do now  =P<br /><br />Regardless... a database is only needed where iNES isn't sufficient.  You may grill me for this... but for homebrewing... <em><strong>iNES is sufficient</strong></em>.<br /><br />The lynchpin of UNIF and this XML format is that it's about preserving the original hardware.  In fact, from what I'm reading in that thread, that seems to be the critical selling point here:  databasing.  In fact, one of the <a href="http://www.bannister.org/forums/ubbthreads.php?ubb=showflat&amp;Number=32221#Post32221" class="postlink">quotes in that thread</a>:<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">iNES, any version, only cares about giving the people games to play. The goal of the XML-based format is about preserving how the hardware actually works. </div>
<br />
<br />This is the key distinction.  Preserving hardware information is what a database is for.  Getting the game to run in an emulator is what ROM image binaries are for.  You're talking about two very different functions, here, and while they aren't necessarily mutually exclusive... combining them doesn't make the database portion of it any easier to maintain... nor does it offer the end user any benefit.
<br />
<br />Databasing in a file format isn't really an advantage to homebrewers, ROM hackers, and translators unless they're producing their own custom boards.  When you're talking about preserving the hardware aspect of things -- software produced after the fact which piggybacks existing boards doesn't factor in.  What good does saying which specific MMC3 version X homebrew game runs on when it never had cartridges produced and would function equally well on any generic MMC3 setup?  What's the point of databasing theoretical hardware that never actually existed?
<br />
<br />This is one time where the beauty of iNES shines.  Strength in simplicity.  iNES may be completely lousy for databasing -- I'll agree there.  But when you start talking about homebrewing and PD ROMs, you're starting to lose me.  I don't see how this new format is of any greater value to that audience.

<br />Agreed completely.  I actually often debate this very same topic with a friend on IRC.  The format in which the data is interpretted by the emulator, be it in text or binary form, is ultimately arbitrary.
<br />
<br />And if it's all arbitrary -- you might as well go with a format that's easy to work with.

<br />
<br />Agreed++. My opinion is to <strong>accept</strong> new ideas, even if this one (XML) looks controversial. I still believe that UNIF <strong>is</strong> the best choice, though it needs to be more popular between emulator authors and the community (read: players). So, the users will make the choice. 
<br />
<br />At any rate, I'm not a player. I'm interested to develop my emulator for accuracy, by analyzing the CPU, PPU, APU... and making it as closer as possible of the NES.
<br />
<br />The emulator database is a good idea, but why can't be shared between emulation authors, like a .dat file much like MAME?

<br />
<br />Just because bootgod is behind this format doesn't make it smart.
