<br />
<br />On the NES, the memory is clearly split between the vido memory and main CPU memory (there is two different buses) and the only connection between them are $2003/4 and $2006/7. When you write to $2004 (including through $4014) or to $2007, this order the PPU to read that byte, that is buffered, and the PPU will actually write it to memory slightly later when it can. This feature is not available while the PPU is already working on processing the image.
<br />
<br />On the C64, the 64k of DRAM is shared between the CPU and the VIC2 ('PPU'), so that each processor have acess to the memory one cycle out of two. The RAM can freely be used as VRAM and the user can tell the 'PPU' to point to any range of the RAM to use data for image information. Also, the CPU can write a byte into memory, and the 'PPU' can read it the next cycle, that doesn't cause problems because each device is iddle one cycle out of two. The price for is is that the CPU runs almost 2 times slower, at only 1MHz instead of 1.79 MHz.
<br />
<br />Finally, if your programm works on FCEU but not on NEStopia, chances that it doesn't work at all on the real NES are high (FCEU is innacurate, but Nestopia is very accurate). The problem is probably how you set up your IRQ (do you do it between MMC3's counter limitations, discussed very recently on this forum ?) or how you write to the scroll registers.

<br />I can't tell you about the details, and hopefully someone else will give you details, but a while ago the use of $2003/$2003 for updating sprites was very frowned upon. It certainly is slower than using the DMA (if you want to update all sprites), but it seems like there were some bugs also.
<br />
<br />You seem to be using a lot of the "extended features" of the NES, which most of the time are controversial. This is certainly not a bad thing, but I'd suggest you find a way to test your programs on a real NES... You simply can't trust emulators for things like these.

<br />I'm pretty sure someone mentioned a few reasons not to use those registers besides time... Sorry if I can't remember who, or what the reasons were...
<br />
<br />I just have this voice in the back of my head that says "someone at NESDEV said that $2003/$2004 are evil, use the DMA instead". I hear a bunch of similar voices because of things I read here, and I just can't remember the reasoning behind all of them.
<br />
<br />Sorry if I'm wrong. Just test the thing on a real NES and stick to what works.
<br />
<br />P.S.: I don't actually hear voices (O_o), that's just a figure of speech.
<br />
<br />EDIT: Maybe it was <a href="http://nesdev.com/bbs/viewtopic.php?p=658#658" class="postlink">this post by tepples</a>? I'm too lazy to keep searching, but maybe it had to do with OAM being DRAM and all.
<br />
<br />EDIT 2: There is also <a href="http://nesdev.com/bbs/viewtopic.php?p=11925#11925" class="postlink">this comment by Memblers</a>, about demos that don't work (although the demos might not have worked for other reasons?). Anyway, I didn't know much back then, so these recommendations might have been enough for me to avoid those registers.

<br />But you need to turn the display off because the PPU is always accessing the sprite memory.

<br />
<br />Yeah thats a good synopsis of C64 vs NES, my big reason for going with the NES was actually the ROM page swapping, and the the fact that turinign on multi-color tiles on the C64 gives you half res unless one uses some crazy tricks.  That and there just something I like about the 4 color tiles and the way they look NTSC.
<br />
<br />On Nestopia, one thing that got me at first was I needed to write $40 to $4017 to disable the frame irqs.  
<br />
<br />About the MMC counter limitations.  I'm going to have to look into that a bit more.  Bottom status bar I can get working Nestopia, but the top one still evades me.   With enough time I think I can get it workign on all 3.
<br />
<br />Another weird thing, mid-frame palette changes work on jnes for me but not reliably on FCEUX.

<br />I managed to get my example up and running solid on all 3 emulators topbar + 4 way scroll + crystalis irq split using mmc3 irq.   Basically I needed to only use the NMI handler to update the frame counter variable, and not have my game loop in the NMI.  I've only been programming NES for one week, so I'm pretty happy with my progress so far.
<br />
<br />
<br />Still though, thanks for posting the example Bregalad, I'll check it out once I can access your site.

Becuase of this you can actually write the high part of one and the low part of the other.  E.g. write to 2006 once, and the write to 2005 right after is a write to the yscroll value.  Then by writing 2005 to get x scroll, then 2006 to set the low part of the y address This way, I can prevent the 2006 write from overwriting bit 2 of the fine y scroll.
<br />
<br />I'm going to post this code to the nesdev site about this, but this seems to allow me to be able to do 8 way scrolling with a top bar without the bar/timed code to emulate the effect of bit 2.  But I have no clue if it works on an actual NES.
