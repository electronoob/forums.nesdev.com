		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />This is a question that always been on my mind and I want to know why.  When I see many faq about the nes (or other hardware), some address space are mirrored. I understand the same data is available at both address but why would you do that?  No faq seems to explain about that.  Maybe this is common in hardware design but I couldn't find the reason.
<br />
<br />I guess once you know the reason there must be some way to take advantage of that mapping.  For now, I cannot see it.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Because the adress isn't completely decoded in hardware.
<br />
<br />If you read/write to $800 for example, the logic chip inside the NES will see the higer adress lines. If in $000-$1fff range, the RAM is enabled, if in $2000-$3fff range the PPU is enabled, and if in $8000-$ffff the rom select line goes low, to enable ROM on simple carts with no additional logic. This is (very probably) done by a 74xx138/139 adress decoder chip.
<br />
<br />So yeah $800 is in $0000-$1fff range and the RAM chip is enabled. But the 6116 RAM chip is only 2kb and so it only have 11 adress lines (A0-A10). The fact that you read $800 instead of $000 makes A11 goes high, but the line isn't even connected to the chip, which have absolutely no effect.
<br />
<br />By convention, you always set the unused adress lines to '0' unless you have a good reason to. So that if anyone would ever construct a enhanced famiclone with a 8KB RAM chip instead of 2KB your game would still be backwards-compatible.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Thanks again for your answer, always appreciated.
<br />
<br />The way I understand from your answer is that $800, which is a mirror of from $000, point to the next address line A11 and nothing happens.  What I thought it meant from the documentation (nestech.txt) is that $000 to $7FF, $800 to $FFF etc point to the exact same place (the memory chip in that case) and the same value could be read, hence my understanding of the word mirror.
<br />
<br />On the other hand, you mention that usually unused address lines would be left to 0 (for extension purpose).  In that case, the memory address space would have had many "blank" because nothing would have been mapped to it. It would have made more sense to me.
<br />
<br />If this is the current behavior, repeated for the registers too, I couldn't understand the benefit from a programming point of view.  Why having 2 places pointing to the same hardware could be useful.
<br />
<br />Does what I say make any sense?

<br />A circuit that ignores an address signal can be cheaper to build than a circuit that disables the RAM when the address is "wrong".

<br />
<br />So this was done for monetary reason.  I cannot take advantage of that behavior while coding then.  
<br />
<br />I'm glad to know the meaning now, thanks!

<br />If anything, mirroring opens new coding opportunities. Without mirroring, you'd get open bus where the mirrors would have been.
