<br />Well, here's a feature request: Would it be possible to add an option to <em>not</em> crop the images when using "Import sprite images"?
<br />
<br />I'm converting this image (differences of the 2nd frame of Joe's face when compared to the 1st one), and when Tilificator crops it, it loses its positional information relative to the original image.

<br />
<br />I have removed the cropping as requested, you can find a new Windows build <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/tilificator/files/releases/tilificator_v0.2C07-0-win32.zip/download" class="postlink">here</a>
<br />
<br />About opening the project: you accidentally made Tilificator select the codepath for loading the old deprecated XML-based format that I was using before, probably because your project file did not use '.tpr' naming. 
<br />
<br />I switched to a JSON-based format before the first public release, and kept this support there just to be able to load my old files, and that codepath will probably be removed completely at some later point...
<br />
<br />The choice of it trying to call the deprecated XML loading whenever the suffix is not .tpr wasn't the best one though, as your example shows. So I've also changed it to always use the JSON-codepath unless the filename matches the previous very long suffix that no one should be stumbling across accidentally...

<br />Yeah, I mean, I had no idea that .tpr was the recommended suffix, because the save dialog didn't automatically append it. So I've been using ".tilifactor". <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /> But thanks for the changes again!

Dunno if it's because of the big size?</div><br /><br />Most likely yes... the DragQueen method basically starts out by trying to test pretty much every combination of &quot;columns variants&quot;, where the &quot;column variants&quot; are every way you can cover all pixels in an 8xScreenHeight column with 8x8 sprites without them overlapping. To avoid doing unreasonable amounts of combinations, the columns are reduced by selecting the &quot;probably best ones&quot; (basically a local optimization step, risking to miss out on the final global optimum) so that the final product of all of them doesn't go beyond a certain reasonable size. But the size of your image manages to make the column creation itself go out of memory. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /> <br /><br />I'll have a look at what can be done... probably a lot by just changing list comprehensions to iterators where possible. But even so, the processing time required to tilify that image will probably be enormous due to the large amount of combinations DragQueen tests. So I'd suggest just going with the ShiftedRows method for this particular one...

Also, there were two colors only used in a few pixels that were so close to other colors that I assume they were accidentally put there, and you wouldn't be able to use different ones when using the NES palette anyway, so I remapped those.<br /><br />I started by making the reddish colors of the armor use the BG palette. Also, to not bump into the 8 sprites/scanline limit I had to use an extra BG palette for Joe's right hand, and figured I might as well use that palette for some other BG tiles to have a few sprites less. Got this result using NESST:<br /><img src="https://sourceforge.net/apps/mediawiki/tilificator/nfs/project/t/ti/tilificator/2/2b/Image6_remapped.png" alt="Image" /><br /><br />Then, I used two separate sprite palettes for the skin and blue details:<br /><img src="https://sourceforge.net/apps/mediawiki/tilificator/nfs/project/t/ti/tilificator/1/1e/Image6_fg_new_remapped_bgoptimized.png" alt="Image" /> <br /><br />To avoid the memory constraints of DragQueen, I manually separated the skin/blue sprite overlays and split them vertically. I guess this is what Tilificator should be improved to do transparently when possible...<br /><br />Result with Tilificator: <br /><br />63 tiles and 65 sprites with ShiftedRows method.<br />58 tiles/sprites with DragQueen method, so no need for 8x16 sprites.<br /><br />BG uses 118 tiles. <br /><br />If you want some assistance, I could help you further with optimizing this to fit your title screen requirements, but I'll need to know which constraints you're working with. How does the rest of your title screen look? Do you want to implement some of the scrolling effects from the original game? (logo going in one direction, Suer Joe image and text in other directions) If so you probably need to use sprites exclusively for the top of Joe's head to be able to scroll Joe independently.

The only real difference to the original I can see is the missing shading on the right (Joe's left) arm, but that's not a big deal.<br /><br />As for constraints, there's nothing too special in the title screen, like in the original. I used two background palettes for the logo (just because of the light red line in it). I also need one color for the selection bullet point, but that can use a color from Joe's outfit, or wherever (color doesn't really matter). The font needs the white color, that can come from the logo palettes.<br /><br />I'm up for implementing the scrolling effect. It looks like your version of big Joe already has the top 11 pixels of his head (re-)defined with sprites, so that could be enough for some overlap with the logo. Of course there also the option of not having overlap at all.

I must have mistakenly erased that while optimizing the image.

(no re-use of tiles) That leaves you with a very fine margin of 2 sprites for the bullet point and a sprite#0 hit. Again, I had to split the images vertically to avoid the memory error...<br /><br />As for the scrolling effect, I can't imagine how you would manage to get all three independently moving objects from the original, so you'll probably need to compromise a bit. Maybe just remove the bottom text when the user presses start and the screen flashes, so that only the logo and Joe have to scroll?

(no re-use of tiles) That leaves you with a very fine margin of 2 sprites for the bullet point and a sprite#0 hit. Again, I had to split the images vertically to avoid the memory error...<br /><br />As for the scrolling effect, I can't imagine how you would manage to get all three independently moving objects from the original, so you'll probably need to compromise a bit. Maybe just remove the bottom text when the user presses start and the screen flashes, so that only the logo and Joe have to scroll?</div><br />Thanks man, that looks absolutely perfect! Can you send me the .tpr file of the sprite overlay?<br /><br />For scrolling yeah it was my plan to scroll just Joe and the logo.
