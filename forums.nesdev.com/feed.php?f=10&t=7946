i personally use the ex attributes in my megaman odyssey rom hack that MMC5 provides. Im not sure how i can show you the code exactly cause i only type in hex numbers. I dont use assemblers or any of that stuff. I did it all from scartch myself.<br /><br />But well, how i was able to draw ex attributes, i basically copied the very exact same screen-drawing code megaman 3 did. It's puely the same except just storing the EX attribute data to a temporary RAM area, and unload it after an NMI is finished. (since ex attributes are only allowed to be updated during rendering)<br /><br />some of my levels have as many as 800 graphic tiles instead of the normal 256 limit. And i mean NO bankswitching or CHR-swapping of any kind needed. <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br />-----------<br />well like for example. when scrolling left/right, the game writes to 780-7A1 RAM for the nametables right ? To update the screen when scrolling right. <br />ex: 780 = 20, 781 = 02 (2002 Nametable PPU Address), 783 = 1D (number of tiles to change)<br />I store the EX Attribute data between 7D8-7FF. It's the same format. I use 7D8 for 01, or 20 (when it needs to be vertical or horizontal scrolling), 7D9 and 7DA - 5C02 for Ex Att's - just add + 3C00 to the nametable address), 1D tiles again. And then the ex data from there.<br /><br />im not good at explaining these things. <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" alt=":(" title="Sad" /><p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3920">kuja killer</a> — Wed Jul 27, 2011 9:47 pm</p><hr />

No problem. In programming in general you always want to be sure you've initialized everything since many things have no defined power-up/start-up state. Undefined or uninitialized registers and variables being used can cause all sorts of problems. <br /><br />Emulators often have behaviors that could let you pass without problems but fail on real hardware. Power-up states of mappers in emulators is one example, another is often all RAM is zeroed by emulators which is not the case on real hardware.<br /><br />So just remember before relying on any registers or memory to be sure it's been initialized to the desired values.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=1726">MottZilla</a> — Sun Jul 10, 2011 5:28 pm</p><hr />

This works fine, obviously, when using no mapper, a 32KB PRG-ROM, and thus, when the memory is present/loaded at boot.

The sprite is actually two sprites overlaid to give the appearance of an NES sprite.<br /><br />The NES version runs but I have not implemented sprite animation (nor any metasprite system) or character output. I'm at a decision point where I will have to dedicate to the 16x16 approach or use MMC5 before implementing the character output code.

But alas, deciding to what resolution to restrict the playfield is the easy part. Making a music/sound effect engine that restricts the voices on the C64 to closely resemble the limitations of the NES sound system is not too hard.<br /><br />I have a general approach so far that I haven't implemented completely that will overlay C64 sprites to appear to have the same multicolor nature of NES sprites. This application level sprite will take up two of the eight alication level sprite slots. To the C64 build, that means two of the eight hardware sprites. To the NES, that means reserve two of the eight metasprite slots but only truly use the first metasprite.<br /><br />The sprite palette system on both systems are fairly different too, but again, one can be made to mimic the other; in this case, the NES interface can be made to mimic the C64 (ie modifying the palette entries and recommitting it to the GPU).<br /><br />I want to match the C64/NES as closely as possible. I wouldn't let the other platform implementations lower the capabilities though. For instance, I wouldn't require all sprites be monochrome like the Atari 2600; instead, maybe I'd set up some kind of display list (HBlanking) color system that would draw the 2600 monochrome sprite in the 3 or 4 bands of color that the application sprites were set to (think of cutting out the silhouette of Mario and color him like the German flag).<br /><br />Anyhow, solutions and/or compromises can be made. But what isn't happening right now is me figuring out how to setup MMC5 where FCEU doesn't show all gray when I boot my rom up. NES development is already touchy enough and adding probably the most complex mapper on top of it doesn't help. Does anyone have like a barebones example of a rom/asm that uses MMC5, particularly using the ExAttribute mode?<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=4935">puzzud</a> — Thu Jul 07, 2011 3:26 pm</p><hr />

NES is much superior in these features, and universal solutuion like a cross platform library should aim for lowest specs of all the supported platforms. 8 large sprites that C64 provide, being recreated on NES with its 8x8 sprites, would be pretty useless, at least because of the 8 sprites per line limitation.

On C64 you can however multiplex sprites to simulate more than 8 esaily, although it consumes some precious CPU time. But even then the sprite size is a major issue, and the multi-color / hi-res problem on the C64 (which on the NES it's always multi-color AND hi-res), and the very different screen resolution make it a hell of a nightmare to make a dual C64/NES game, without having one very majorly different from the other.

Most mapper docs say "the first bank is loaded at $8000 and the last bank is loaded at $C000".  In your case, the first and last banks just happen to actually BE the first and last banks.  You'll want to look at the MMC5 description of the registers though and make sure there aren't any that "come up with random garbage".  If there are you'll want to inject code in the reset vector to intiialize them to some quiescent state.  Other than that I think just changing to mapper MMC5 from "no mapper" should be simple.  At least you don't have other mapper writes to worry about trapping for and replacing with a MMC5-ish equivalent.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3705">cpow</a> — Wed Jul 06, 2011 7:00 am</p><hr />

The two system's sprite manage is so dissimilar that I've had to accept that my sprites will likely need 16x16 (as a single sprite on the C64 can't go any bigger). I was really just hoping to eliminate the need to compromise on the character graphics. The small resolution and 16x16 color limitation on the NES is what hurt so many ports (ie LodeRunner)--requiring scrolling when it wasn't necessary on its predecessors.

C64 have a bitmap mode, although it is not very useful for action games. There is a text mode that used similar to NES as well.<br /><br />I'd better worry about other differences than the attributes size. For example, scrolling and number/sizes of sprites. NES is much superior in these features, and universal solutuion like a cross platform library should aim for lowest specs of all the supported platforms. 8 large sprites that C64 provide, being recreated on NES with its 8x8 sprites, would be pretty useless, at least because of the 8 sprites per line limitation. You would prefer to use native NES sprite features, but you can't recreate them on C64.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=4205">Shiru</a> — Wed Jul 06, 2011 12:09 am</p><hr />

^ That. Poeple program the system to get the games on it. If you wanted a game just for emulator, you pull out C and SDL/Allegro and get working on that. And does the C64 have a bitmapped screen at all? If so, that alone would make cross compatibility insane, since I think the NES works largely different than the NES. Especially with RAM constraints without more hardware.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=4311">3gengames</a> — Tue Jul 05, 2011 11:08 pm</p><hr />

I think that the lack of interest on the MMC5 is due to the impossibility of producing new carts. The MMC5 is by far the most complex (NES) mapper there is, and so far nobody has successfully replicated it in hardware, which means that in order to make a cartridge of a homebrew that uses ExGrafix you have to destroy an original MMC5 cart.<br /><br />I don't think anybody wants to make software that can't be easily put into real carts, so that's why the MMC5 is largely ignored. Personally, I don't see much appeal in running NES software exclusively in emulators.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=95">tokumaru</a> — Tue Jul 05, 2011 9:04 pm</p><hr />
