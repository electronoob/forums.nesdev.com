<br />
<br />Yes, I was going to say the same for the enemies.
<br />
<br />And I could do it in SMB3, But the problem is that I cannot do a full disassembly for SMB3. as opposed to the currently used SMB1 disassembly. So probably scratch the sprites part, 
<br />
<br />I also tried to make SMB1 use different music (something in the size of 0000-3fff (the size of Hebereke.NSF without the Header and DPCM data) in a hex editor), But I could not. It is something in the line of ''SMB2 and 3 uses a very hard-to-do techniqe to put music in a hidden place in the unknown'' (Possibly a case of Program Bankswitching with $8000-$BFFF during Initialization?)

<br />
<br />Mapper 0 has no way to generate IRQs for raster effects (at least -- none that would allow you to remove sprite 0 hit -- you could use DMC IRQs for a rough timing, but sprite 0 hit would still need to be there so you can get the time right)
<br />
<br />SMB2j was for the FDS, which had an additional CPU cycle counting IRQ generator (why they didn't put something this simple on the NES, I'll never understand).
<br />
<br />Anyway -- to do this you'd need to switch to a mapper that has IRQs (like mapper 4).  But this involves other headaches in the form of rerouting the reset vector so it lands in the fixed page, and prepping a bunch of mapper regs at system startup.
<br />
<br />Doesn't sound like much work, but with how little free space SMB has... additional code means you'll either have to gut and remove an exising routine or two... or you'll have to expand the ROM.

<br />I would expect that all of the SMAS games utilize the SNES much more like an NES than other games written specifically for the SNES since they're basically source-level ports, and much of the game logic is identical.

<br />I am thinking about editing and useing the E000.asm included with Loopy's SMB2J-NES project. and remove the code I will not need (Will use the leftover space that I deleted, I also deleted SMB1's music).

<br />
<br />Nobody knows for sure, though you have the chance to hack a MMC3 game and study its IRQ subroutine. Depending of what you want to do, it won't be so much different. An IRQ is merely a "branch" to a subroutine. Usually, you can take advantage of score bars or raster effects.
<br />
<br />You're asking this because you *probably* have played SMB1 hacks that do NOT use mapper 0, right? Try asking some rom hacker...

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Oh blah... I'm sorry Hamtaro -- I feel kind of dumb.  For some reason my brain blocked out all the times you mentioned MMC3 (it's even in the thread title)
<br />
<br />My apologies.
<br />
<br />Anyway setting up an IRQ is pretty simple on MMC3, but there is a big caveat:
<br />
<br />All sprites must use right-hand pattern table &amp; BG must use lefthand pattern table.
<br />
<br />I believe this is the opposite of how SMB does it.  *checks*  Yeah it is.  You technically can get away with SMB as it is now -- but it's ill advised.  Especially if you plan to move to 8x16 sprites -- in which case the BG <strong>MUST</strong> be using the left pattern table.
<br />
<br />To make this change, simply flip around the CHR in the ROM and change what gets written to $2000 (specifically, you'll need to switch bits 3 and 4).  Make sure you catch and fix every $2000 write SMB does -- there probably aren't too many of them.
<br />
<br />
<br />That caveat aside.. IRQs are pretty simple.  You'll need to set up the IRQ counter in VBlank so that it fires on the desired scanline.  Then when it fires, you just split the screen's scroll and acknowlege/disable the IRQ:
<br />
<br />To enable/set up the IRQs (done in VBlank):
<br />1) Write N to $C000, where 'N' is the number of scanlines you want the IRQ to fire after minus 1.  (This sets the reload value)
<br />
<br />2) write any value to $C001 (this clears the actual IRQ counter)
<br />
<br />3) write any value to $E000 (this enables IRQs)
<br />
<br />4) clear the I flag with a CLI instruction
<br />
<br />also) I don't think SMB has other IRQ sources enabled, but if it does you may have to disable them.  The only one that's a concern really is APU frame IRQs.  Just make sure that whenever SMB writes to $4017, bit 6 is set.
<br />
<br />
<br />To acknowledge/disable IRQs (do in your IRQ routine):
<br />
<br />1) write any value to $E001
<br />
<br />
<br />For example -- if you want the IRQ to happen after 32 ($20) scanlines, you'd do the following:
<br />
<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">;&nbsp; in VBlank &#40;probably in NMI&#41;<br />&nbsp; LDA #$1F<br />&nbsp; STA $C000&nbsp; ; write $20 - 1<br />&nbsp; STA $C001<br />&nbsp; STA $E000<br /><br />; IRQs now up and running<br />; make sure the CPU doesn't mask them<br />&nbsp; CLI<br /><br /><br />;&nbsp; in your IRQ routine, you need to acknowledge the IRQ:<br />&nbsp; STA $E001&nbsp; &nbsp;; that's it!<br /></div>
