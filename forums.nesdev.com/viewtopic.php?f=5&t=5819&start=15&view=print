		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I'd really like as SNES PowerPak, but can't afford the taxes.
<br />
<br />I live in Brazil like Fx3 and had to pay the outrageous tax of 60% of the value of my NES PowerPak, and of course I wasn't happy at all. I don't expect to buy anything else from RetroZone because of this. Most sellers I dealt with saw no problem in declaring lower values for their products in hopes that they wouldn't be caught by customs (after all it's their product and they can sell for as much as they'd like... who can say the number in the paper isn't the true price?), but bunnyboy said he wouldn't do this. So yeah, for some people getting a PowerPak is quite a bit more expensive than for others.
<br />
<br />Hey Fx3, are you watching The Lost Canvas? I <strong>just</strong> came back home from a concert where Hironobu Kegeyama performed, if you like Saint Seiya you may know him... =)

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Hey people.  Looks like the game gods and goddesses chose to smile down upon me, maybe after I reminded them what a devoted follower Ive been, lol.  I CAN download .NES files and play them on this little contraption Ive been talking about!  I cannot as yet use the CD drive with a CD or DVD to play .NES roms, but, I can save the .NES roms onto a USB stick or SD card, and have the dvd player load them right from that...  And the emulation seems pretty good so far.  I think from what I have gathered, the cd-drive unit itself is a no go as far as individual files are concerned, because I think and it stands to reason that the hardware is seaching for a file structure matching that of you know - DVD, CD, VCD...  which has a certain architecture/standard.  Of course as most of you probably know a typical dvd player is not like a PC where you can explore through individual files of any extension, and view them up on a screen.  Anyway, it does work with USB/SD, which I am more than fine with.  Thanks for all your assistance and suggestions.  ALso some people on here might be interested in a little doo-dad I found on EBay, and even with worldwide shipping charges this thing is like 50 bucks.
