<br />No he doesn't.  The labels and ROMs say absolutely nothing about being reproductions.  All still use the company logos, Nintendo seal of quality, etc.  Only RetroUSB has things that say "reproduction" (NWC) and has their own seal of quality.

<br />Perhaps for some games they are similar in price. But that doesn't necessarily mean they are similar in profit. And I'm not sure if GR including shipping costs, where as I think NR does?
<br />
<br />Also here is a perfect example of GameReproductions having issues. <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.gamereproductions.com/products.php?product=Holy-Diver">http://www.gamereproductions.com/produc ... Holy-Diver</a><!-- m -->
<br />
<br />Holy Diver, uses a custom Irem mapper. The only game that has this mapper, is a legit famicom Holy Diver cartridge. We know he is not making them by using legit cartridges. Instead, he is using MY mapper hack to MMC1. True I put it out there for anyone to use, but my point is that he is irresponsible because my hack of that game is actually broken. But he'll happily sell you a broken game I'm sure as he likely has no idea. I overlooked/didn't notice that my mapper hack for that game was broken when I released it. It seemed to be working ok but it's actually messed up. 
<br />
<br />And as far as RetroUSB, they make it clear as day that you are buying a non-original cartridge. It doesn't try to look like a legit cartridge at all. Best of all those games are new parts, not scavenged.

<br />
<br />I can't say I really am that concerned about it though. Just wondering when the day will come that games that were once very common are all gone. While I suppose it would happen anyway it's only going to be accelerated by these things. Though if people take care in only recycling some of the most terrible games to have been produced, ones that hardly anyone can stand to play, that wouldn't be so bad.

<br />Basic economics: if the common games were heavily used for repros, at some point they would become uncommon, at which point their price would rise to a point making them uneconomical for repros, and making new parts more economical, or at least making <em>other</em> once-less-common-but-now-more-common carts more economical to use.

But at some point, repros and the parts to make them (such as parallel flash and parallel SRAM) will become cost prohibitive, as will maintaining an authentic NES to run them. By then, objections to using an emulator to play hacks and translations will likely have vanished, and for original games, just developing for a portable API (such as SDL, Allegro, or Android) will become the cheapest way to get an <a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Retraux" class="postlink">NES-style game</a> in front of your players. Consider that Eversion and IWBTG were both developed for PCs.

<br />But I'd bet that eBay gets its NES Game Pak listings, especially for D and F rarity games, from 1. people selling a box with dozens of carts for $2 per cart or less, and 2. people who frequent rummage sales where grandmas clear out "old Nintendo tapes".

<br />
<br />Well for one thing, anyone with real intelligence would use a dev cart. I mean, it's not hard to figure out that they exist, or even where to buy them. These people are not intelligent and thus, they want it explained to them. They want nothing else but to destroy game carts to sell illegal repros. Particularly with translated ROM hacks. That's the new trend in black market gaming, if you haven't noticed.
<br />
<br />So yeah, blacking out the information to these unintelligent types will slow down the growth of illegal game markets. These persons are all extroverts, or else they would take the time and energy to read the existing material. They don't care to learn it by their own energy, just to have it taught to them so that they can compete in this emerging black market. I know the type... I've had a lot of experience with them. All they care about is getting in on the profitable trend. No one who would disassemble a cart without reading the material first (or taking the time to make real emotional connections over IRC while learning it there) would care to contribute back to the community. There is just no motivation.

<br />
<br />I don't think this is interest in NES-dev or even romhacking in any way. At best it's interest to play with hardware, at worst it's just an easy way to make cash.
<br />
<br />Some of you just can't understand that, unfortunately, not everyone has good intentions. You said repression is bad etc... which I understand, but if people committing the infringement to make a devcard from a ROM they don't own and sell it for a crazy prize remain not only punished but also not oppressed in any way, and that people say it's good because it gets them interested in development, such a market will explose even more, and there will be more and more people coming here just so ask how to cut 2 traces and add 2 wires, or how to make fake labels, etc...
<br />
<br />I'm all against this stuff. If you guys don't want repression I say ok, but then be careful when people with a low post count "kindly" ask for advice to do "make" themselves a game (that they don't own and that is 100% illegal).
<br />Again I can't understand the logic of making it look as if nobody here download ROMs illegaly, if we answer to threads such as those, which doesn't make an "illegal" virtual copy of the game, but an illegal real copy, which is probably twice as worse.
<br />
<br />When they sell translations or hack this is even more disgusting as all fan translaters and hackers always mention this is not for sale. If it was it would be illegal anyway as no hacker or translator owns copyrights on any commercial games.
<br />So they basically is a big *** in the ass of the original creators of the game, of the hacker/translator, and of us because we answer questions that shouldn't be asked in the first place.

<br />
<br />I highly suspect that people are only buying ROM hack repros because they are confused into thinking that if they buy the bootleg that makes the copy legal. Or maybe they insist on believing that. Whatever the case, the folks at RHDN are up in arms over the practice, which is threatening to turn a lot of their selfless work into cold hard cash for criminals. Bottom line is, the fewer people are involved in this emerging black market, the less the RHDN people are going to be taken advantage of. So if you want to protect your romhacking work you'd start here. DMCA will help in a lot of cases, but it seems like a two-pronged approach would be the most efficient.
<br />
<br />But yeah antisocial personality disorder exists... the consensus is that it is environment independent... and even besides all that, times are very, very tough and people are trying to make money any way they can.

<br />If anyone actually played the game they would know what is wrong with it. However since I receive no credit or payment for the use of it, I feel no reason to notify anyone about it. Infact I'd be happy if these people pissed off many potential "customers" by selling them Holy Diver. Maybe it would turn people off from buying from such sellers or buying repro bootlegs at all.

<br />
<br />I unintentionally did something similar, but more minor in my Contra MMC3 hack - that was intended for use for bootlegging long before I started opposition to bootlegging as a whole.
<br />
<br />Maybe I should have released my unfinished Gradius II MMC3 hack that wasn't working too so that bootleggers would sell it and stupid people buying them being taught at which point it's bad to buy pirated games ? It had graphical glitches in the second part of world 1, and would freeze randomly around world 3. Would have taught them a lesson, but not to the bootleggers themselves unfortunately.

But I can assure that the scene of making repros has grown very quickly those last couple of years. There has been nothing like that around years 2004-2007 - people were just not interested in that.<br /><br />About 2 years ago there was this french guy who told me on this forum to join one forum of their and I was happy to see a forum about stuff in my language. but they were only talking about making bootlegs and ONLY that. With advice for fake labels, etc...<br />They asked me lots of advice about NES carts, which ones they should destroy to make which games, etc... but I VERY quickly grown tired of it. Seeing such an industry of fake games being created pissed me off and I didn't want to be involved again. Also there was some fights between the guys too because they would steal other's labels to make their bootlegs etc...<br />Those guys could "make themselves" like dozen and dozen of boolegs without even being tired. They'd make just all transltations, hacks and even originals they don't own. They probably wouldn't feel bad selling them.<br /><br />It's since this day that I was revealed the existance of such a black market. People who denies this just haven't seen it.<br /><br />Now it's not up to me to juge whenever this is good or bad, but at the very least it is a copyright infringement, even if for personal use (no selling) as making a boolegs REQUIRES downloading the ROM.<br />If you use a hack/translation then it's a second infringement, and if you make fake labels, probably a third one. Doesn't sound any good to me.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">and even besides all that, times are very, very tough and people are trying to make money any way they can.</div>
<br />[completely off topic]Come on, times are constantly being very though since 1980. Actually they have been very though since froever up to 1950, and then again since 1980. Only 30 years of economical euphory and ecological disaster, and 30 more years later people thinks a miracle will occur and that economy will be back to the 50's growth. [/completely off topic]
