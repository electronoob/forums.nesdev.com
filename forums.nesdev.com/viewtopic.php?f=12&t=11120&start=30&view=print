		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />The &quot;patch&quot; has nothing to do with what voltage the battery puts out. If saves have some tendency of being corrupt it could be caused by how the patch handles SRAM. For example if code somewhere corrupts or invalidates the save data, or if somehow you could interrupt the saving process leaving invalid data in place. I have no idea how the saving is programmed in their AST patch.<br /><br />All the battery's job is to maintain enough power to keep the SRAM in its low-power retaining mode. If the battery voltage drops too low it will lose the data, the patch has nothing to do with it.

All is working better (not perfectly) with 120ns sram... <br /><br />This is because the -12 sram needs a lower power from battery to get the stand-by mode and in the switching time it keeps the data better than -70 do.

It depends on the series of chip, the manufacturer, the date of manufacture, etc. In other words, some SRAM chips were made to be more low power than others, independent of access speed. Certain series of SRAM chips also are safer to bring down to a lower voltage than others.<br /><br />Good luck finding all this information nowadays. It isn't so organized, and a lot of stock is going to be pulls (used parts). Your best bet is anything that says Low Power SRAM, but even then it would help to consult the datasheet.<br /><br />Also, SRAM doesn't lose data sequentially starting from the beginning. So there's no particular spot a number should be. It's just going to be random bit flips wherever, maybe in a certain pattern for that particular chip (most bits of certain rows or columns that would tend to go one way or the other), but mostly random if we're talking generalities across a lot of samples.

So now I need to do a write up and a how-to-use it (although some of the videos will show some of that)<br /><br />I am leaving for vacation tomorrow (Saturday) so I won't be able to ship until I get back. I have 200 pcb's total but I only plan on selling 100-150 of them. <br />Price is $15 each. The pcb's are ready to use as is. If you want socket strips, then add $1 for 4. It doesn't come with roms. Acquisition of the roms and programming will be your responsibility. <br /><br />Please read previous posts on features and check out the videos also. <br />Thanks for reading!
