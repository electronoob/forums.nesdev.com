		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />This project + nesasm = bad. Use an assembler like wla-dx, it's better for this kind of thing. And you should try and remake some of this stuff your self. Not everything is just drag and drop on a computer, you actually do have to do some of it by hand. I'm remaking FFVII for the NES (Don't tell anyone outside of NESdev that!) and I have to make the engine, all formats, and stuff. Bregalad is doing the sound, though. And I'd avoid NERD tracker for these types of projects. I think I may write my own sound editor for other projects, because NerdTracker is full of bugs, and I could never get it to make a usable NSF. If I were you, I'd just write all formats to everything, so you know EXACTLY what's going on, and how. And you should write your own sound engine. It's really not that hard to write an engine. It may sound like a pain in the ass, but it's really not, when you know what you're doing. I'm not too far in the engine for FFVII, but I am sorting everything into memory, because that's what is most important, becuase this is a HUGE project, and before I actually use data to load data, I have to figure out where everything is in memory. You should figure out how every thing will be sorted into memory before you start. If you are using a Mario 3 level editor, make sure you know how to load it into a ROM. I'd suggest actually writing your own format. I'd suggest writing all formats, like I've said before. It's really not that hard if you know what you're doing. My advice now, is if  you do not know what you are doing, turn back and read 6502 documents, and learn what you are doing before you start doing it! I hope you do know what you are doing. Really, I'm going to say it again, you should come up with formats for EVERYTHING. And yes, YY-CHR is the best graphics editor in my opinion. Everyone else prefers TLayer Pro, but not me. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />
<br />
<br />
<br />EDIT: I see you say you are using 6502.txt and stuff as help files. This is not good. Read them, and learn 6502 before you even think to start this project. It's an easy language to learn, really. with only like 20 somethin' keywords, you can do alot. But do not come bareling into this project. Take it slow. Really.
