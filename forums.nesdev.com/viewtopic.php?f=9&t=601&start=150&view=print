<br />Nope, my old monitors only supports PAL signals and via R/F anyways.
<br />
<br />Also I think it's odd the signal is too weak, because normally the PPU outputs directly the correct voltage, and the common collector amp with Q1 should make the signal strong enough to be loaded by a cable.

<br />However I'm unsure what the amplitude of the signal is SUPPOSED to be.
<br />According to the schematic on NESdev main page, the PPU is already supposed to output a signal of the correct (voltage) amplitude, the transistor is just here to amplify the current. So unless the transistor or some other component fails, I see no reason how this signal could be insufficiently amplified. However I'm no expert in this so I don't know really.

<br />Woah at least 114,688 changes for a whole screen? Didnt know it was that fast.
<br />If your multimeter has a setting for testing if a wire is whole or something like that you can test if any traces are broken.
<br />Dont they usually look like diode symbols?

<br />You sure your o-scopes fast enough <img src="./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" /> (lots aren't)...Kevtris did some work on the voltage levels. I think he said that with the proper video circuit it pretty much falls exactly into the boundaries the voltages should be in. (ask him?)

<br />Anyways measuring at about 60Hz is enough to view the VBlanks every ~17ms, and this negative spike is about 0.4 V below the ground it seems. I have no idea whenever this is normal, I'll measure this again and compare it with the amplitude directly at the output of the PPU. Both should normally match I think.

<br />
<br />-0.3 to -0.4V into 75 ohms is correct sync levels for NTSC.

<br />
<br />As in negative voltage? That would definitly cause syncing issues I think.
<br />
<br />edit: nevermind apparently thats normal according to the above post.

<br />- Remove the RF box and replace it by AV jack (what I already did the other day)
<br />- Replace R1 by a 120 ohm resistor
<br />- Replace R2 by a 68 ohm resistor
<br />- Remove R3
<br />- Do what rt9342 says at the end of page 4
<br />
<br />Works great. No external board needed.

I also did the Stereo mod at the same time and mange to get every thing to fit really nice.  I have written a very detailed guide using “Autoplay Media Studio” It’s a AIO program that is very easy to use just download and open.  Then follow the instructions on your screen. I have included lots and lots of very detailed pictures and a parts and tool list of every thing you need to do this.  Tips and detailed instruction for every step in this mod.  I tried to make the guide Idiot Proof.  This guide is written more for the amateur / beginner.  This guide has everything from harvesting the Need component parts from the NES 1 toaster to building the Video Amp board and even mounting the RCA or 3.5 Jack.<br /><br />It is 7.51 MB file size mainly due to the Detailed Pictures taking up that space.<br />Download here: Removed because no one used it and it expired!! Use the NON AIO link instea its still good <br /><br /><strong>BOTH FILES ARE SAFE AND ARE THE SAME JUST ONE ISN"T A AIO</strong><br /><br />Due to some False Antivirus reports because its a self contained encrypted archive .exe. I have now released a NON AIO version you can (Just download it&gt; Unzip it&gt; Open folder&gt; And open autorun.exe. <br /><br />DOWNLOAD NON AIO HERE: <a href="http://www.sendspace.com/file/k21bpm" class="postlink">http://www.sendspace.com/file/k21bpm</a><br /><br /><strong>BOTH PROGRAMS DO THE SAME THING AND ARE BOTH SAFE</strong><br />Sample Pictures below of this guide:<br /><img src="http://i33.tinypic.com/2d290k0.jpg" alt="Image" /><br /><img src="http://i36.tinypic.com/2gvlqf8.jpg" alt="Image" /></div>
<br />
<br />I finally got round to modding a Top Loader NES with the guide above, however I have hit some troubles with it. In case it helps, I have a US Top Loader and I am based in the UK (PAL TVs etc)
<br />
<br />Following the guide above, the AV out gives me the following picture quality:
<br />
<br /><img src="http://i.imgur.com/aKfpV.jpg" alt="Image" />
<br />
<br /><img src="http://i.imgur.com/Y1DFs.jpg" alt="Image" />
<br />
<br /><img src="http://i.imgur.com/VyYQu.jpg" alt="Image" />
<br />
<br />Not only are all the colours really dark (doesn't show too well in the pictures unless you look at the clouds), but the mod seems to really struggle with the colour black. When you go onto the screen which tells you how many lives Mario has, the TV loses signal and shows a black screen and the AV channel number I'm currently on.
<br />
<br />To add to that, as the first picture and third picture shows, any areas with a lot of black that doesn't result in a blank screen seems to distort horizontally. 
<br />
<br />To my knowledge I have followed the guide perfectly, however the results (as shown) suggest otherwise. I'm hoping someone can quickly point out the error, as it's beyond me <img src="./images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" alt=":(" title="Sad" />

<br />Well, this is probably a direct result of the colors being too dark. Black becomes "blacker than black", i.e. goes below the valid voltage range of black, and in to the sync range, distorting the display.
