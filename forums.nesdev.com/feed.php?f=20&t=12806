The iNES header won't distinguish <em>StarTropics</em> from <em>Low G Man</em>, and the common emulator hack of ignoring the MMC3's WRAM disable and write protect bits to get MMC6 games working breaks <em>LGM</em>. Nor is there a reliable way to distinguish SOROM and SXROM from SNROM and SUROM, or distinguish among the various VRC bit assignments.<br /><br />But fortunately, I today discovered that the official site for iNES (fms.komkon.org) has gone NXDOMAIN. This leaves NES 2.0, which clearly distinguishes MMC3 from MMC6 and the MMC1 boards from one another by their WRAM size, and which has submappers for the VRCs.<br /><strong>Edit:</strong> As of the next morning, it was back up. The DNS server must have gone down.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=9">tepples</a> — Thu Jul 23, 2015 8:08 pm</p><hr />

To make the implementation complete though, there would need to be some way of specifying such files (perhaps support to add one additional &quot;mapper override&quot; file which specifies various parameters that you can set for the game).<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=4734">zzo38</a> — Sun May 31, 2015 11:22 am</p><hr />
