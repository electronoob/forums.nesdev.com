The GI tract has to go somewhere. And limbs placed directly behind a head would be homologous to hands, not feet. So I elongated the creature somewhat, producing something vaguely doglike. Is this cute or ugly?

Allow me to quote parts of the song &quot;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dem_Bones" class="postlink">Dem Bones</a>&quot;:<br /><br /><ul><li>&quot;The shoulder bone's connected to the neck bone&quot;<br />This is the current design, with weight bearing on front limbs.</li><li>&quot;The hip bone's connected to the back bone&quot;<br />This would use feet instead of hands. </li></ul><br />Putting in the back bone would put the face higher up on the sprite, like Gurin and Malon from <em>Binary Land</em>.<br /><br /><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_Land" class="postlink"><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/7/72/BinaryLandBoxShotNES.jpg" alt="Image" /><br /><em>Binary Land</em> cover art</a><br /><br />In some video games, you can see a character's skeleton when another character deals electric burn damage. One such game is <em>Street Fighter</em> games when Blanka uses the shock move. Another is the first <em>Super Smash Bros.</em> game with Pikachu. In the <a href="http://www.ssbwiki.com/File:SkeletonCompilation.png" class="postlink">screenshots</a>, nine out of the twelve characters show a skeleton. Samus shows Zero Suit Samus, and the waddling heads (Kirby and Jigglypuff) don't actually have a skeleton. GamesRadar has compiled <a href="http://www.gamesradar.com/classicradar-skeletons-nearly-every-bony-bastard-gaming-universe/" class="postlink">a collection of skeletons from <em>Street Fighter</em> and other games</a>.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I don't think you need to consider the internal body anatomy. Much of the art style in the listed examples relies on the fact that the style itself is a very abstract representation of, say, the waddle dee. As it's never really been expanded upon by HAL laboratories, this exercise is left to the player. Given the NES's restrictions, a lot of the graphics are abstract like this. <br /><br />However, this is maybe the closest example you're going to find in the real world: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykuXGdukBZA" class="postlink">Pygmy jerboa</a>

Two body parts are &quot;analogous&quot; if they have the same function, such as the flipperlike hind feet of a harbor seal and the tail of a shark. They are &quot;homologous&quot; if they have the same position in the body plan, such as the pectoral fins of a sea bass and the front paws of a dog, or the jaws of a lizard and the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution_of_mammalian_auditory_ossicles" class="postlink">hammer and anvil bones</a> in the ears of a human wearing a lizard costume. Thus this creature's feet are analogous to the feet of a chicken but homologous to its wings.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">DragonDePlatino wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">It looks like something straight out of a medieval bestiary.</div><br />Thanks.

Even chibi characters have skeletons, as <a href="https://atechnologyjobisnoexcuse.com/2006/12/michael-paulus-cartoon-skeletons/" class="postlink">Michael Paulus sketched</a>. Yet an upgrade from 256x240 on the NES to 1920x1080 on the Wii U does nothing to clarify what goes on inside Waddle Dee and other 1-head-tall characters.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">However, this is maybe the closest example you're going to find in the real world: Pygmy jerboa</div><br />The jerboa, jumping mouse, kangaroo rat, and similar are interesting models for a different species. A bipedal hopper's head would be placed higher because as with birds, there's a backbone between the head and legs. Maybe later if I try making something inspired by Pogo from <em>Nebulus</em>/<em>Castelian</em>.
