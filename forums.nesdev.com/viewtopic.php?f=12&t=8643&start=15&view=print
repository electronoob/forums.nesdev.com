		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I got my Super UFO Pro 8 flash cart this week.  It is smaller than the Super Power Pak.  The build quality seems good, but is difficult to get to work.  I first tried using it with my FC-16 Go and SanDisk 512MB SD flash card.  The cart booted and showed a nice graphical copier-like menu with music.  However, it was unable to read the SD card, which is was formatted FAT16.  So I reformatted the SD card using the FAT32 format, and the Super UFO Pro 8 flash cart was able to read the SD card.  However, once it finished loading the game into DRAM, it would display an error "No Game in DRAM".  I was only able to get Super Mario World to load from my SD card by putting the Super UFO Pro 8 into "Hyper" mode as opposed to "Normal" mode.
<br />
<br />I then tried it out on my real SNES.  The cart wouldn't boot without another cart plugged in on top, indicating that the Super UFO Pro 8 cart does not have a built-in lockout chip.  The only cart that I do not have in storage is Super Mario RPG, so using it as a passthrough cart was problematic, probably due to Super Mario RPG's overly paranoid anti-piracy electronics.
<br />
<br />I'll reserve final judgement until I get my other SNES carts out of storage and see if the Super UFO Pro 8 is able to boot reliably on a real SNES.  However, it boots around 1% of the time right now on a real SNES when using Super Mario RPG as the pass through cart.  Not fun.
<br />
<br />The Super PowerPak is a bit finicky about the CF card that you use, but once you get a CF card that works, the Super PowerPak is very reliable.  Has anybody else experienced issues getting the Super UFO Pro 8 to boot on a real SNES?  Do games fail to play in "Normal" non-cheat mode?

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />It should have a built in lockout chip. But maybe it doesn't match your region? From what I've seen it doesn't seem like a "great" product but it could be ok. Seems like people have some troubles with it. But if it's working for you, it's not bad, and it's a bit cheaper than other flash carts. Really if any problems are worked out and you get a good price it could be a nice deal. But I still like my SNES PowerPAK. The only way I'd stop using it would be if I buy the SD2SNES.

It has build in function to check the buildin DRAM and SRAM, user can go to the CHECK menu and select the DRAM CHECK, SRAM CHECK and ROM CHECK to see the SuperUFO buildin memory work ok or not.
