NESdev already provides a wealth of tech info and competant individuals with its subjects that it caters toward.  
<br />
<br />...Would providing an extra development subsection forum regarding the software and hardware development of any computer or console 10 years of age or older potentially be useful in the NESdev forums?
<br />
<br />Examples of these computers or consoles could possibly be:  Atari 2600, Super A*Can, Playstation (PSX), ZX Spectrum, PC-98, Sega Game Gear, Nintendo Virtual Boy, Sega Dreamcast, TI-994a, etc...

<br />We also might consider a PC-Engine/TurboGraphix-16 subforum, But I have to also have to ask Tom (the PC-Engine dev specialist) to be admin if he would be able to.

<br />I agree. Development for other retro platforms fits well into General Stuff.* If discussion of some other platform gets out of hand, I might realign GBdev and SNESdev into Other 8-Bit Platforms and 16-Bit Platforms, or perhaps 8080 Platforms and Other 6502 Platforms.

Hell, even the SNES forum is pretty much dead (a lot of it is just piracy-related questions), so I could see it being merged with the GB one to make the "Misc. Retro Dev" section. I'm sure a lot of people will disagree with me though. EDIT: Ninja'd by tepples (kinda).

<br />
<br />There is no 6502 in the SNES but a 65816. It is a 6502 variant ok, but there is also many thread about the SPC700 in there... which has nothing to do with a 6502.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Making the 'Other 6502 dev' forum is a smart way to consolidate things, but after thinking about it, it seems like the SNES really deserves it's own forum around here.  SNES and GB both inherited of traits from the NES and are it's successors, so it seems fitting.  One could easily play NES music on a GB, or run an NES program on SNES.
<br />
<br />With that said, I think it would be pretty cool to have a forum that might attract posts related to any old computers, consoles, arcade games.  Though of course a lot of these systems might have their own communities somewhere, but something interesting is bound to happen eventually.

<br />And the NES inherited a bunch of traits from the ColecoVision. I was thinking broadening GBDev to include all 8-bit platforms with a CPU descended from the Intel 8080, especially those with a Z80 (Speccy, CV, MSX, SMS, Game Gear).
<br />
<br />Oh, and the SPC700 is a lot more of a 6502 variant than some people might think. The opcode bits are just permuted, and I can prove this to you if I have an SPC700 opcode matrix handy.

Just 8-bit main CPUs? That'd include PCE and exclude Genesis and PCs running MS-DOS, but it'd also technically exclude Intellivision and Apple IIGS.
