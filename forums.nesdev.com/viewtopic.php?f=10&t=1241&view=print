		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Hello Everyone,
<br />       Im very new to the programming the NES Console.  After Extensive serching on the internet.  I have Found no information on how to install NESASM.  Im running an XP right now but have tried on a 98 without sucess. Ive tried the MagicKit and everytime i run the app an MS-DOS comes up momentarly.  Same thing happens when i try and run the bob frost version with Nbasic.  Well here are my questions?
<br />
<br />1. WHat hell is MS-DOS?  Does the NESASM have its own GUI or is it in DOS style and do i have to type commands on the prompt to use it?
<br />
<br />2. What locations do i have to install the Magickit or NESASM in?
<br />
<br />3.  On the Bob Frost Website it says the Nbasic version needs Cygwin.dll to run.  Where do i install this file?
<br />
<br />4.  What are bin win32 directories??
<br />
<br />5.  Can i compile it in BloodShed C/C++ Assembler, using the sources(e.g. XXXXX.h, XXXXX.c)
<br />
<br />6.  HOw can i run the NESASM in an 6502sdk?
<br />
<br />I know these are alot of questions, but hopfully to the experiance it is nothing.  Some one Please help me ive been reading on 6502 ASsembly and NES Documents for Quite sometime and i want to experimanet and learn more by running my own code.
<br />
<br />THanks,
<br />EL

<br />- I'm not sure if I undertand it proprely, but if you don't know what MS-DOS is I can do nothing for you.
<br />
<br />NESAsm doesn't need to be "installed" or anything. Its a raw DOS programm. Run it through a DOS command window. If you have Windows, you have DOS anyway. You can get it from "Start -&gt; Programms -&gt; Accesories".

<br />
<br />How i "install" it?
<br />
<br />It comes with these files:
<br />neshla-20050417-src-win32
<br />
<br />neshla-20050417-bin-win32
<br />
<br />What does this mean: bin-win32, src-win32?
<br />
<br />Sorry So many questions i just hope someone out there can help me with there expertice.  Regardless of how easy it,  it pretty freakin confusing to me?

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Those files are most probably compressed files, with "bin" = binary files (so the programm) and "scr" = source, so the code.
<br />
<br />I use WLA-DX. A lot of people seems to prefer CA65. Nesasm is okay if you're a very begginer, but keep in mind it is an assembler that target beginers.
<br />
<br />I think all of these but HLA runs under dos. For an unknown reason, a lot of freewere is only available under DOS. Maybe the don't want to pay Visual C++ for windows or whatever.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I asked these questions when I first stepped into the world of programming the NES. It took me like 3 months to realize that you don't install NESASM, or any 6502 assembler, pretty much. And it also took me that long to realize that the DOS window isn't supposed to stay up for more than half a second. Open the program in the command prompt, then when you have some NESASM source code, type: nesasm something.asm , and it will assemble. Something.asm of course, being whatever the name of the NESASM source code is.

Most commercial softwares need particular system instalation and have a default repertory to install in (usually C:\program files\...) but you usually can change this to another repertory.
<br />Myself, I put all big programms in the "program files" repertory, and all small ones have their own repertory or set of repertories.
<br />
<br />I know that, I installed about 15 programms on my new computer today  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=":wink:" title="Wink" />

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Command Prompt != DOS.  Just because a program operates through a console and uses a command prompt doesn't make it a DOS program.  Many Windows (and Linux, BSD, etc for that matter) programs operate through a command prompt -- that doesn't mean they're all DOS programs.
<br />
<br />That aside -- rather than opening up a command prompt and typing out a bunch of crap every time you want to assemble something, you might want to get familiar with creating batch files.  I don't know a whole lot about them myself -- just the bare minimum to assemble stuff.
<br />
<br />Adding on to Celius' example... rather than opening the command prompt and typing that in every time -- open up notepad or another plain text editor and type that line into notepad -- then save it as "assemble.bat" or something of that sort.  Make sure you actually save it as "*.bat" and not "*.bat.txt" (notepad might automatically append the .txt extension) -- and put that ni the same folder as your assembler and source files.  Then when you want to assemble, simply double-click on the .bat file and it will do all the command-prompt stuff for you.  If you want the window to remain open so you can see any errors or stuff the assembler spit out, simply put "pause" on a new line in the bottom on the .bat file.

<br />P.S. i noticed on the Junkdemo there only two files JUnkdemo.asm and JUnkdemo.chr.   In the future as my games get more complex with there be any more files to add.
