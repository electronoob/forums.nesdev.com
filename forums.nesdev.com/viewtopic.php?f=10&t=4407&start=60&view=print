<br />
<br />Ever heard of Chrono Resurrection?  They weren't going to make any money either.
<br />
<br />Even if it's not for profit, you cannot sell a project like this.  You just might get away with it if it was different enough from the original, but in that case, can you really call it Megaman 9?
<br />
<br />-----
<br />
<br />As was said on earlier pages of this thread, there are quite a few reasons why the game wouldn't work on the NES.  I'm no expert, but I believe I can identify some of them.  One of the primary reasons is color use, and the other main obstacle is scrolling of large objects.
<br />
<br />The very first screen with the robot masters looks like it uses too many colors (or else too many sprites to overlay the necessary colors on the background).  It just might be doable but would require a lot of experimentation to see if it's even feasible.
<br />
<br /><img src="http://img268.imageshack.us/img268/2143/27658460.png" alt="Image" />
<br />
<br />Note that background colors on the NES must be in 16x16 pixel blocks - you get to use 3 colors for every 16x16 pixel section.  You can put sprites on top to add more colors but this gets costly.  From looking around on Megaman 9 this limitation would probably be an issue in many places.
<br />
<br />The fade transitions between menus and such are too smooth.  If you play a regular NES game with a fade you'll be able to see 3 or 4 "tics" of fade, sometimes using awkward coloring.
<br />
<br />It looks like there's too much color cycling going on.  You can have machinery flashing smoothly from black to green on the same screen as blinking red lights as well as two enemies and Megaman each with their own colors.  There are different ways to do color cycling; maybe the green one is an actual palette changing, and the red one is being bankswitched or edited CHR-RAM.  The point is that this is present in many places and it would take a lot of careful observation and playing around to determine if it's even possible.
<br />
<br />In Jewel Man's stage there are large jewels changing colors and small jewels doing the same.  But there are two different types of flashing on the small jewels, the inverse of each other.  Either that uses up two palettes on its own (very costly just for a jewel) or it's two separate instances of the jewel in CHR data with opposite coloring.  I'm not saying it's impossible, but that sort of thing is wasteful when it comes to the NES.
<br />
<br />The swinging platforms in Jewel Man's stage mentioned by dwedit are indeed a problem.  Large movement like that is usually achieved on the NES by scrolling a part of the background, but if that was the technique then we should see all the platforms swinging at the same time.  They are also at different heights, making the scroll method even more unlikely.  The alternative is sprites, and the platforms are made up of too many of them.  They would flicker and look awful, assuming they didn't use up all available sprites in the first place (the NES supports 64 8x8 sprites, and that includes Megaman and the enemies and anything else small that moves).  The chains would add to this as well.  Besides all that, the platforms/chains look like they move too smoothly for NES calculations...they might use a big look up table, but that contributes to a huge game size.
<br />
<br />Similar problems are present for the huge fire blasts that can be frozen with concrete.
<br />
<br />You know that boss that's two big blobs, fights like the Yellow Devil?  That would be extremely difficult to replicate on the NES.  When the blobs move up/down independently, and the floor also stays still, you're talking about a vertical split scrolling in different directions that is also timed such that the bottom of the screen does not scroll.  Rest assured this is pretty tough, if not impossible (considering you're also keeping track of the rest of the game engine).  Again, you could try it with sprites, but an 8x8 tile blob uses up all your total sprites (half in 8x16 mode).  And there would be so much flickering you'd barely be able to see it.
<br />
<br />And when they explode?
<br />
<br /><img src="http://img188.imageshack.us/img188/6280/62419392.jpg" alt="Image" />
<br />
<br />The only reasonable way to do that is with sprites, and there are simply too many of them.  8x16 sprites could come close I suppose but that introduces difficulty of its own.
<br />
<br />"So what?" you can say. "We'll tone down the explosions."  But that's one isolated example of this sort of problem, what about the whole rest of the game?
<br />
<br />Each problem taken separately is a puzzle to be worked out; all of them together on one game is a nightmare.  If this game were to be made I suspect it would rival Kirby's Adventure in size and complexity, and would still never be the same as the original.  Some complicated mappers might help but that greatly limits your ability to put it on a real cart.  You'd have to tear up a rare Japanese game just to make one copy.
<br />
<br />Now, you could always say, forget the swinging platforms then, replace them with a tough platforming segment.  Forget the colors too, just use less of them.  The jewels don't have to color cycle, and the robot master pics can be greyscale.  The blob boss doesn't have to move up and down.  Then if we trouble implementing another part of the game, we can drop that too...suddenly you're working on a different game.  In the end it starts looking like a standard Megaman 2 hack.
<br />
<br />It's true that quite a bit is possible on the NES with enough effort.  Most MM9 problems that look undoable might be able to be solved through tricky timed code.  However when you get into that, there's usually not enough time to process the rest of the stuff going on onscreen (enemies and such).
<br />
<br />I'm not trying to be mean, just realistic.  You mentioned earlier that for you to learn to do it yourself would take years, but it would take just as long for anyone else to do it too.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />@wildonrio:  I think you didn't read much the nesdev forum recently I guess.  For testing my game engine, I will try to do one mega man 9 level.  I don't promise to finish it but will try.  Concrete man level should have less issue than jewel man for sure.
<br />
<br /><div class="quotetitle">UncleSporky wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">If someone was to do this project, it would have to be a labor of love.</div>
<br />
<br />I would preferably call that "torture" at the moment ^^;; It's quite hell.
<br />
<br />If someone would remake the complete game and I base it on my current speed, without a game engine and without knowing all the hurdle they will have to figure out a way to make it work on the nes... For a single person, unless you have no life and do it 8h+ per day like a job, you're almost going for a 3 to 5 years project, if not even more. Add to it if your developer doesn't have experience on the platform and it may never happen.  Knowing 6502 only it just not enough for the project.  You have a looooottt more to learn then that. And... You need tools if you want o save time.  Just making the tool for the maps... That's a lot of time that you have to take into consideration. What about the music?  Tssf may now have made most of them but still... You have to make the sound driver work and create the extra part for the sound fx that doesn't exist.
<br />
<br />If you do it as a rom hack, you will limit yourself even more, that's for sure.
<br />
<br />One thing for sure, it will not look like the real game.  The map is already one example that I had to deal with. Each screen are 16x14 metatiles. The problem is there is one metatile missing since the nes is more like 16x15... So either you find a clever trick while scrolling for not seeing the black bar between screen or you will have to compromise and generate the missing data.
<br />
<br />You may have all the requirements defined indirectly since the game already exist but we're talking about a professionally made game with people that where paid and worked all day on it.  It will be extremely hard to make back on the nes.  
<br />
<br />It will take me a lot of time to make that level and a lot of head banging. I don't think for a one person project that it's possible to make the game. Even with a group, that would still be hell.  You said that if you could, you would do it but I would not recommend that for a beginner project. The only reason I try one level is because I have experience in programming for many years, even thought is not on the nes. I hope that experience will help but it's still hard.
<br />
<br />I have the wad file, I have the extracted file but not with the data extracted. The data is not easy to extract, not really. You're looking for quite a hellish job here just to get the data. Someone extracted all the tiles from the background somehow but that still doesn't include the sprites.  The sprite hackers only extracted a few of them so I guess they stopped because it was not easy.  I found the bird for concrete man stage and it's spread all over the place. Nobody extracted for some reason I guess.
<br />
<br />Now you have the comment from someone that is working on it.  If your developer just "know" a little bit 6502, you can put an X on it right away. It requires a lot more than that.

<br />Knowing 6502 and knowing how to make a game are very different things. If I had to pick someone that only knew one of those things, I'd pick the one that has programmed a game (or at least confidently knows he can) than the one that knows just 6502. The 6502 is very simple, and there are tons of references about it, any competent programmer will pick up on it quickly. The PPU is another big issue. Understanding how it works is also much more important than knowing 6502.
<br />
<br />I'm not saying the person you found knows or doesn't know things, I'm just expressing my opinions on what the priorities are.

<br />I guess that the similarity is that it's still a new game released for an old system (although I can't say how old Somari is, I guess it hit the web fairly recently). It doesn't really matter if it was made by slave chinese children or by a fat nerd in his basement, it will have the same impact over people that still care about the old system.

<br />That's not the problem. There is plenty of people who are Mega Man fans here and that knowns programming well. It's just that doing such a thing without Capcom's authorisation is completely illegal, so probably it will take a while before someone takes the risk of doing it (don't count on me). I'm confident that this will happen eventually.
<br />
<br />EDIT : Now I've watched through all stages (8 robot masters and 4 wily stages), and I admit it sounds very doable on a NES. Sure, there is some still images in cutscenes that have too much colors, and some places that would flicker. However, with minor color reduction and slight graphics changes, almost everything could be done on the real NES with a normal cartridge easily.
<br />The only exeption is that boss battle with a red core and a green core. First the cores seems to use MUCH more than 3 colors for their graphics (this can be easily scaled down). Second, there is a point where they move vertically, and are both on the same horizontal line. The only way this could be done is by making one a sprite and the other a BG, but due to their large size, as a previous guy already said, it would take almost all 64 sprites on its own. So the only real solution, without changing their attack pattern, is to use MMC5's vertical split mode (in SL mode) that only one space shooter ever used yet.

<br />And there is 8 Mega Man X games out there (altough the last 2 for the PS2 in 3D aren't very good). I guess Capcom discontinued the series, now it's the RPG series Mega Man Star Force which is going on (and they're really good).

<br />Honnestly if you have done the intro + 1 level with perfect physics and all, you have done about 60% of the work in my opinion. But yes that would be okay on the legal side, but really on the edge of it I guess (I'm not lawyer anyway).
<br />
<br />On the other side it doesn't cost anything to write a letter to Capcom asking for the authorization of doing it (or at least aksing if they would sue the one who do that). Chances you're getting a positive answer are probably low, but that would fix the things on the legal side.

<br />I wouldn't mind to go see Inafune(稲船)-san, rockman original designer, and have a little chat with him in Osaka.. If Capcom let me in in the first place  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_lol.gif" alt=":lol:" title="Laughing" />  I already have an idea for the box.  I guess I should focus on my game engine and make the %$#% sprites work instead. meta-meta sprite.. How to fix that issue... hmm..  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />
<br />
<br />As for sending mail, I did once for init creates (Megaman 9 creators) in their customer support section and in Japanese but for another subject. No answer yet. I'm not expecting any too.

They just haven't released the series in chronological order. Mega Man X was released between 6 and 7, yet it's the 10th in chronological order.<br />Also Dragon Warrior 3 is a prequel to 1&amp;2 but this times the numbers got in the order of release dates.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">I wouldn't mind to go see Inafune(稲船)-san, rockman original designer, and have a little chat with him in Osaka..

<br />Well you can go at Capcom and ask them directly if it's possible to be authorized to port MM9 to the real NES. I can't without buying two $700 plane tickets (which I don't want to).

<br />Or it would be if Mega Man 9 covered the death of Dr. Light or other events that set up the plot of the MMX series. Or will there be 9-2, 9-3, 9-4, etc., like the Final Fantasy X series?
