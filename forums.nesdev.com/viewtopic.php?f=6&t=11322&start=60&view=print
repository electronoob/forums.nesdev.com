A big mess. XD

You might need to make it configurable per NSF.</div><br />   That is a good point, is there any ram that is un-molested by NSF play routines? <br />   As l_oliveira noted there is a vast gray area as to what a NSF can do. Am I wrong in thinking the vast majority of NSF Play routines don't touch WRAM? I know WRAM addresses are part of the NSF definition but in practice how many Trackers/Composition tool's player code use it? Only a very small number of NSF I have tried had a issue with ram at $0500 let alone WRAM (none) but my sample size is very small and I haven't messed at all with game rips (which may be more probable to use WRAM).<br />   But this brings up another point I've been wondering about. As this code switches between NSF, should I be clearing the low ram as I do in the reset routine? (haven't see any problem so far, but...) All my VARs and Sprites are in WRAM now, so clearing the lo ram is only a benefit to the loaded NSF. It's really not clear to me if the NSF handles the initialization of the ram it uses. <br />   Then again the NSF format was never assumed to be running on a console, right?<br />Yogi

I've tried FCEUltra but it's timing is not setup right or this XP box just doesn't like it; it runs very badly and stutters horribly. Looking for a stand alone disassembler.<br />   I implemented the ControllerTest code you posted with mixed results. It runs fine and I think is faster on average, than the original routine I had; but the troubled NSFs have the same errors as when using the original code. So I'm thinking there is a subtle bug somewhere else. Or it is due to the frequency I read the controllers in the Main Loop and the timing of the DMA activity. In which case I will have to live with it and use the workaround of not reading the 'Right' button, which is not the worst thing (it speeds up the Main Loop). At the very least, the good news is I have a definite cycle count for each pass of the routine.<br />   Also changed the handling of the Sprite ram, to allow easy reassignment of it's ram location. WRAM should be the safest place; if the NSF clears WRAM, it will destroy the runtime code as well, so this software will not support it anyway. But it's flexible enough if I needed to use system ram at some point or in another project.<br />   I just ordered one of INL's Sunsoft 5B carts so next on the agenda is to try out your 5B code! Looking forward to it,<br />Yogi
