<br />
<br />It's supposedly a remake of the Streemerz game from Action 52, but it's more of a Bionic Commando style action/puzzle game, complete with authentic 8-bit Engrish.
<br />
<br />And some levels make Battle Kid seem easy.

<br />Sometimes it's useful to prototype the game first on a "big" platform and then reduce it to the small platform. This lets the original developers concentrate on balancing the game itself, even with inefficient programming, and leave fighting the target platform's limitations to the port team. This can be seen in the "Hong Kong Originals" (common in the far east) and 16-bit to SMS ports (common in Brazil, as I understand it).

<br />
<br />But seeing how someone made a perfect rickroll song on the NES and how tinytoons adventures had layering to make a better looking image im sure this is possible. to make a great port of a game.

<br />Some other ports, such as the HKO ports of Aladdin for Genesis and Aladdin for Super NES, would have been decent with a bit more polish in the play control. Also see any Game Boy Color game; the GBC is not unlike an NES with MMC5 and more RAM.
<br />
<br />So I guess the next step is to contact the game's author to see if 1. he wants the game ported, and 2. he can offer any help with the port, such as design documents.

I think porting this to the nes would work fine but i see a few parts where 5 colors were used instead or 4 colors. That might be an issue.

<br />Yeah, but that's the point. The dialog is crap, like in lots of old games, to the point of sounding like sexual comments at times. The dialog in this game is half of the fun!

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />It's a pretty simple game, but it sure is fun! Too bad the resolution is wrong (320x240). Would love to see this ported over to the NES. Actually I'm kind of interested in doing that myself, because lack of graphics has always been the biggest problem with NESDev for me. However the levels would need to be re-designed or horizontal scrolling implemented because of the resolution.

<br />
<br />The web page linked at the top of the topic played a (fairly long) commercial for HP printers that print over the Internet, then a black screen. I had to reload the page to get it to load.

He sent me the player sprites but hasn't responded to my latest message where I asked for more assets (levels...). <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />
<br />
<br />Here's how it looks currently:
<br /><img src="http://thefox.aspekt.fi/stree.png" alt="Image" />
<br />
<br />"Streaming" (not fine tuned yet), physics, collisions etc are already done. Just need to implement the pie throwing clowns (pretty simple) and the fire candles. And a bunch of other stuff, but it's looking pretty good.
<br />
<br />I was wondering if somebody would like to help with converting the levels? The job is simple but tedious: take screenshots of each screen in the Flash game and edit all sprites/etc out.
