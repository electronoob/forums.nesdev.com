I want the game to be fast, no dept in the screen so you have to move from platform to platform very fast and attack the other player(s).<br /><br />I did a quick search to try to find back the screenshot that inspired the idea and I think it was the game Towerfall on the ouya.  I only saw a screenshot of (maybe) that game and I like the limited scope of the screen but I'm not sure if this is exactly what I had in mind since I never saw the gameplay so it may be similar. <br /><br />I want to create characters with different skill set (strengths, speed, range, size etc) that can battle in a limited stage. Some passage would allow you to go from top to bottom (or left to right depending of the stage selected), there would be traps, part that help you move faster etc. You can kick-jump on wall to go higher, use the environment to move or attack, etc. That could be a good small project to create a code base for bigger projects.<br /><br />Now that there is a windows version of towerfall (didn't know about that) I may give it a try and look at some of the video online and check if this is what I had in mind or not.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">na_th_an wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">Anyways, I have a set of multi-purpose global variables and 75% of the &quot;strange bugs&quot; I spend hours fetching have to do with it <img src="./images/smilies/icon_lol.gif" alt=":lol:" title="Laughing" /> <img src="./images/smilies/icon_lol.gif" alt=":lol:" title="Laughing" /> <img src="./images/smilies/icon_lol.gif" alt=":lol:" title="Laughing" /> <img src="./images/smilies/icon_lol.gif" alt=":lol:" title="Laughing" /></div><br /><br />I remember that trying parameters that way in assembler too many bugs came out because of that.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I made an earnest attempt over a 3 month period to adapt to C in early 2016 or so, for my current project. While I can imagine smarter folks benefiting from it, I just couldn't get used to it. I had too many weird problems I didn't know how to solve. Either something with syntax, or I didn't understand whether something allocated ram or rom, or I just had to bastardize the C language so horribly and mangle it beyond comprehension I might as well be coding in asm anyway. And finally, I attempted to write a metasprite routine in C, and drawing a large 18 sprite metasprite took <em>a frame and a half. </em> Rewriting the same routine in assembly and drawing the same large sprite took about 1/10th of a frame. Obviously nobody would write a metasprite routine in C to begin with, but that difference in speed was so alarming I became afraid that I would run into performance issues way more often than I'd like if I adopted C. I'm also terrible at reading code and if there's ever a problem, I really didn't want to pore over the code cc65 generates...OH! And things like sub pixel precision, like 8.8 velocities added on 8.8.8 coordinates? That comes out <em>so naturally</em> in asm. The pointer math or other workarounds one must do in C are rather unpleasant.<br /><br />The bottom line for me though is the &quot;feeling&quot; of coding in assembly just makes me happier, period. Totally irrational, perhaps, but that's a good enough reason for a hobby where nothing matters but whether one is happy anyway.<br /><br />Use what you like, not trying to discourage anyone from using C, I think it's really awesome it's being used so well by many excellent fellow homebrew devs.

I have partly come to the opinion that even for intelligent people, which programming language approach works best for a person depends partly on what kind of brain they're born with.  For me, Forth was a natural.  My enjoyment of assembly has also increased in recent years as I have done more to raise the level of the language, using <a href="http://wilsonminesco.com/StructureMacros/" class="postlink">macros</a> to make nestable program structures.  I really cannot understand how anyone could go for C.
