Its like having somebody else look at your code and tell you what is wrong with it instead of finding out for yourself. I know that it rigorously tests all aspects possible that most games wouldn't and that it is technically legitimate to use them as they would work on a real NES and they don't specifically tell you how to be a programmer. But I think that it makes for a lazy programmer.<br /><br />How do you guys feel?

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />They're cheating if you're programming an accurate emulator as some kind of proof of being a programmer cowboy. Of course using a compiler that reports errors in your code rather than generating a crashing executable is also cheating, as is using a high-level language (asm is a high level language to a cowboy). Real cowboy programmers program in machine language, and never need to test their code since it works on the first try. At this point it's probably clear that only <a href="http://www.techstartnews.com/23/chuck-norris-it-jokes" class="postlink">one person</a> fits the bill.<br /><br />On the other hand, tool-wielding homo sapiens use every tool they can lay their figurative hands on, including compilers with extended error checking, debuggers, automated unit tests, which includes test ROMs. All of these tools extend the power of the user, but only if used intelligently, which is where these programmers get satisfaction. They don't see the wisdom in intentionally obscuring one's perception when debugging.

No cheating; nothing novel, either.  FWIW I had the very same experience and followed the very same steps you outlined when working on MMC1. MMC3, and I'm sure many other mappers.  Zelda 1 worked but Zelda 2 was graphically messed up.  Yada yada.  In that case, I used my built-in mapper debugger view to look at what the registers were set up for, and what CHR address was currently mapped at what 1KB CHR bank, then looked for paths through the code that differed based on those settings, then found the issue, then fixed it, then celebrated.<br /><br />I may be remembering the two games wrong...but I know I had issues with MMC1 games that CHR-switched either 4KB or 8KB, or switched between the two switching methods.<br /><br />*If there were such a test ROM I'd imagine it'd put pictures up on the screen and have the user hit &quot;A&quot; for &quot;looks right&quot; or &quot;B&quot; for &quot;looks like shit&quot;.  Sort of like an eye exam...&quot;which is better?  number 1, or number 2?&quot;  Eventually with enough cases and enough user response the test ROM could point out that you likely have a bug in your 4KB CHR bank switching for mapper X.  But that's just it...CHR bank switching is different for *gobs* of mappers [are the bits in the CHR register shifted to form the address or not? are there bits in the CHR register that are not part of the CHR bank mapping?  does CHR mapping rely on the state of more than one register?], so testing all of the possible &quot;problems&quot; you could have with it is absurd to try to automate.

So you want to make your program so clear and simple (or have such a good picture in your mind that it can be large and complex) that you can see any problems and not need any other tools to help find them. This is in contrast to the approach of programming in ways that plan on having tool assistance when debugging. &quot;No way I can look at my code and be sure it emulates this properly, so I'll just use this tool to test that aspect.&quot;<br /><br />It's an interesting trade-off, and gets to the core of what one wants out of the experience. A puzzle as you say where the point is to use only one's mind and minimal tools (text editor with search?) to diagnose problems. Or to see how much one can extend one's abilities with the best tools available. The latter tends to use tools to make difficult problems simple, by giving one a clear view of something that was obscured using one's unaided perception abilities, e.g. a debugger showing variable values at run-time, or a test ROM setting up certain conditions then seeing what happens if a particular thing is done. The fun as you say of a puzzle is that it's challenging only if you're unaided. Getting good at using programming tools to make challenging problems trivial tends to eliminate the fun from solving challenging problems, at least the ones eliminated. Personally I find no joy in working hard at a problem that is only made hard due to not being able to see everything and thus bumping around aimlessly in the dark, especially when I know that there is a flashlight available.
