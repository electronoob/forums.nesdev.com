<br />I'm not sure if Rockman 2 could be hacked to UOROM or not. It normally uses MMC1. I think the only feature it could use that might be an issue is Name Table Mirroring Control.

<br />
<br />That's actually pretty easy to add to the upper bits of UxROM by doing the same thing as holy diver to get swapable between H/V.  I don't know what mirroring it uses but if it's NT0/NT1 then it's even easier you just use and upper bit of the latch to drive CIRAM A10 directly.  (EDIT: although that wouldn't support MM1...  and this would also require MM1 to be hacked to support the swapable mirroring that was installed.  It shouldn't affect speed or anything though.)

<br />It can be very easily and the hack is already prevalent. The MMC3 provides the mirroring control..

<br />What is "sanction"? It has a lot of meaning in my dictionary.
<br />
<br />And here is a new menu with new logic for Rockman 6 in 1. I extracted this menu from 1997 SUPER HIK 8 IN 1 EW-800 :
<br />
<br /><img src="http://krauser.persiangig.com/other/Rockman_5_Menu.png" alt="Image" />
<br />
<br /><a href="http://krauser.persiangig.com/other/Rockman_5_Menu.zip" class="postlink">Here is the IPS patch if you want to try it</a>
<br />
<br />If It works it can fit inside of a FC cartridge but it will be ugly! So I have to test it only on breadboard!
<br />
<br />Oh and by the way : 
<br />jayminer on nesdev IRC channel helped me to fix the palette and background  color of the menu, He is a GOD for sure! Thank you jayminer  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=":wink:" title="Wink" />

No offense to you Farid, but the U.S. government doesn't exactly agree with the Iranian government.  So in order to 'punish' your country/government our government forbids any of our goods to be sold to anyone in your country.  
<br />
<br />Basically it's illegal to sell American produced goods/semiconductors to Iran, which may prevent you from buying certain things like CPLDs.

<br />A chip disabled with /CE high runs in a low-power mode; it takes a while after /CE is pulled low before the chip starts producing data. A chip enabled with /CE low but disabled with /OE high draws nearly full power but can deliver data as soon as /OE goes low.

<br />1) wasting lots of space in ROMs
<br />2) no need two data lines for CHR RAM/CE CHR ROM /CE(use Q and /Q of '175 - once at the time you using CHR RAM or CHR ROM)
<br />3) no need two data lines for PRG1 /CE PRG2 /CE(same as above, only about PRG1 and PRG2)
<br />4) '174('175 as well) latching data on rising edge
<br />
<br />That's what i can see from pic above
