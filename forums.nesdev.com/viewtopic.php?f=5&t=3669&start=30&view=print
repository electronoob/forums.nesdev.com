<br />You started this thread. If you really don't know about "the facts of life", you are retarded, because that's some really slow learning. If it was just a joke (as you stated), it's a retarded joke, and only a child who is just learning about sex would find this topic amusing, making you retarded.
<br />
<br />EDIT: Yey! We reached the 3rd page with this crap! Don't get me wrong, I kinda like retarded threads, they are usually fun. This one not so much, but still...

<br />In male mammals, a penis is a plug that serves two main biological purposes: disposing of waste water, and insertion of biological software into a "vagina", or the jack on a female.

<br />
<br />If anything, I'm still somewhat baffled on how someone in their mid-twenties can match comical maturity of someone 1/2 that age.  I'll admit, asking where babies come from has been &amp; probably is still on my top-10 list of favored questions, but to keep pushing the question in a serious manner after some have shown affection of anger just seems like pushing it too far...

<br />Well, even us nerds gotta have some fun once in a while! XD
<br />
<br />WedNESday's question is still not as annoying as evildragon's hoaxes. He insults people who are working on serious projects, WedNESday was just seeing for how long he could play dumb, so he was at most insulting his own intelligence and maturity.
<br />
<br />Anyway, you gotta admit that it's nice to see people here doing something else than talking about a 23-year-old game console. I mean, some of us HAVE GOT to be nice people! <img src="./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=":wink:" title="Wink" />
