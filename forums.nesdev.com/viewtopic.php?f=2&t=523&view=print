		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I'm not sure exactly how to describe this but here goes. I'm working on translating a game (well, it's already translated, I'm just adding the final touches on the "hacking" side) and there's an issue with a certain string of text.
<br />
<br />Now, the 1K of VROM that contains the number tiles (0-9) (I'll call this chip A) is swapped in and out with another 1K of VROM that contains other graphics (chip B) that needed to be displayed on-screen. Thing is, for some reason, the right 1K of VROM (chip A) is loaded into Pattern Table #1 where it's supposed to be while the vram-write routine is writing the numbered tile's data to vram. But, here's the problem, once the screen refreshes it isn't the tile that was on chip A that gets displayed, but the one chip B. It *is* the right tile number and all; it's just the wrong chip that it's getting it from.
<br />
<br />I'm not sure why this is. I'm thinking it have something to do with how the PPU refreshes, but I'm not sure as I've never really studied the PPU beyond basic function. If someone could maybe shed some light on this, I'd be most appreciative. The game uses Mapper #16, by the way.
<br />
<br />Thanks.  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />The PPU does <strong>nothing</strong> during VBLANK - rendering is done, by definition, during the RENDERING time (i.e. during all 240 VISIBLE scanlines).
<br />
<br />Also, the PPU is <em>in no way</em> aware of whatever bankswitching you may be doing in the mapper, and most mappers are likewise unaware of what area of the screen the PPU is currently rendering (the only known exception is the MMC5). Just because you wrote to your nametables with one CHR bank selected does NOT mean that the mapper will magically swap in that CHR bank when that section is rendered - it uses whichever one you selected most recently, meaning if you want to change banks mid-screen you have to do it manually.

For example, you can write 88 to the mapper's register, and it'll interrupt the program after 88 scanlines have passed.  Then you could switch the CHR bank in the IRQ routine.

<br />Bob is walking from his house to the shop, which is 5 blocks away. He can walk one block in two minutes. He leaves and begins walking the first block. He reaches the second block at two minutes, the third at four minutes, etc. During the first two minutes, his feet touch the sidewalk of the first block. During the second two minutes, his feet touch the sidewalk of the second block.
<br />
<br />Q: When are his feet touching the sidewalk of the fourth block?
<br />A: During minutes 7 and 8.
<br />
<br />Q: If I'm simulating Bob walking to the shop, when are his simulated feet touching the simulated sidewalk of the fourth block?
<br />A: During simulated minutes 7 and 8.
