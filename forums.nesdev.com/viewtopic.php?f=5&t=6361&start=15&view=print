<br />
<br />I agree 100%.
<br />
<br />In the US imported goods <em>HAVE</em> to be artificially marked up or else it would devestate our economy.  Our higher regulations and wage laws make the cost of production much, much higher than that of other countries *cough*China*cough*
<br />
<br />If imported goods could be purchased for a quarter of the price of domestic goods, <em>nobody</em> would buy domestic, and companies would be folding left and right.
<br />
<br />If anything, I think imported goods and outsourced jobs should be taxed/penalized even more to encourage/push companies to keep labor and production in-house.
<br />
<br />But then that turns into a fine line.  We have to form relationships with other countries, and it's give and take.  If we start unreasonably taxing the hell out of import shipments, they'll start taxing the hell out of our stuff, and it will bring international trade to a standstill.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />A "free market" is a positive thing?  Not in my book.
<br />
<br />Government control is necessary to prevent abusive employers and monopolizing.
<br />
<br />Take out governmental regulations and we're back to the industrial revolution where 3 companies run the entire country and everyone is poverty stricken, slaving away for pennies a day, and dying in their 30s.
<br />
<br />A lot of people think government control is a bad thing, but really there are some areas where it really is a great thing.  Economic issues and international trade are definately areas where the government should always be involved.
<br />
<br />TOO MUCH government control can of course be a bad thing.  The key is finding the right balance.  While I can't say that the US is perfect (or even the best out there), I can say that it's not terrible and there are lots of places where it's much, much worse.
<br />
<br />But there's no "perfection" line.  What seems like a perfect balance for someone will seem too unfair to someone else.  So whatever.

Copyright is an example of a distortion that was intended to be positive but hasn't always turned out so well, due in part to the movie industry's control over the major news media and in part to (alleged) <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tip_%28gratuity%29" class="postlink">gratuities</a> paid by employees of motion picture publishers to legislators' reelection campaigns. Corruption is government action in exchange for a gratuity; it gets confused with distortion because corruption usually causes distortion.

<br />I agree.
<br />But again, a distortion is a displacement from a normal state. It depends on what we see as normal or ideal. Imposing trading rates by the state is indeed a distortion <em>from</em> a free, unregulated market. That's a distortion <em>if</em> we consider free market as the normal state, as the ideal, as how things should be.
<br />Someone could instead see that a few private dominant corporations controlling the market and setting its prices, is a distortion.
