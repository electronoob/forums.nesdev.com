I might be able to debug it. Out of curiousity, how does one go about gaining port access in your own program without relying on some external driver. I had messed with port access on something else in the past but never got very far. How do you compile something so it doesn't run in user mode?</div>
<br />
<br />I use hwinterface.sys, the driver enclosed within inpout32.dll (I compiled it into my application, since the DLL was compiled in C++ without "extern C" and was thus unusable from a C program).
<br />
<br />The source for the program is mostly identical to the QBASIC version, except ported to C (it behaves exactly the same), so it's possible that your parallel port is being emulated in software (by hooking the port I/O) and said software is crashing (causing a lockup) from both QBASIC and my client program.

<br />
<br />Upon inspection, it was opening the Status window using SW_SHOWDEFAULT, which could have opened the window minimized. I've uploaded a new build (using SW_SHOW instead) - hopefully it will work better under 9x.

It runs WinXP with NTFS formatted disks, but I made a small FAT partition for CopyNES use and then boot it with a Win98 start-up disk.<br /><br />I've also tested it to work on my roommates old pre-built hunk of crap which has a Asus P2B-VT board with a PhoenixBIOS. Using EPP and no settings for EPP version or recovery time. This thing runs Win98.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">Quietust wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">Strange - didn't you click OK on the status dialog?

<br />
<br />I should mention that I was trying this from WinXP on the same machine I use for CopyNES otherwise.
<br />
<br />If the NES is <strong>off</strong> when you start CopyNESW, this is when you get the WriteByte timeout, which makes sense because the NES isn't on, but when you click ok, the main dialog never shows up, just the blank taskbar item.
<br />
<br />If the NES is <strong>on</strong> when you start it, you get no errors, just the blank taskbar item.
<br />
<br />If you try running the program again without killing the old process, then you get the error about the port being in use. But this time the main dialog will show up, but with all main functions greyed out.

<br />
<br />I've made a few other tweaks to clean up the window procedures and hopefully get the status window to always display properly. Even now, it still works fine under Windows 2000, though I have no idea what's wrong with your XP installations that would cause this to not work.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />It seems to almost work now, when it starts, it queries the bios version and correctly id's it. If you hit play cart, it will play, If you try to dump, it makes it until it tries to load a plugin, then it fails.
<br />
<br />I dunno if your doing this or not, but I had to add some sleep time in a couple spots to get my program to work.
<br />
<br />In the resetnes function, kevtris had 2 generic time wasters right at the end. I changed them to Sleep(50).
<br />
<br />At the very end of the loadplugin function I also added a Sleep(50). This was neccessary for me, otherwise it would crap out when runcode() was run. Seeing as how it dies in the same place with your prog, this might be all you need to do.
<br />
<br />I just picked 50 ms out of the air, you may be able to go less, not that it matters at all.

<br />
<br />Thanks Quietust! You ROCK!
<br />
<br />It kept erroring out at first, so I went and screwed around with my BIOS settings until it worked.
<br />
<br />I finally ended up with the following settings:
<br />8 bit I/O Recovery Time: 8
<br />16 bit I/O Recovery Time: 4
<br />Under Integrated Peripherals, I used EPP Parallel port mode, EPP 1.9.
<br />
<br />Also, one other thing, the parallel cable that Kevtris sent is very unrealiable with some machines. It won't work at all on my notebook, but works fine on my Pentium 90. I ended up using a 2 foot cable to get it to work.
<br />
<br />Thanks again.
<br />
<br />Oh yeah, has anyone documented how to control CopyNES?

Don't worry about it too much, I've got mine built into my DB entry program now, so I'm happy and it seems to work for others.
