		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Okay, some time ago when I was fidling, I tried disabling the SNES lockout by removing the clock input to the CIC's. This works fine on PAL consoles, but it didn't give me the success I was after on NTSC consoles, and so I want to know how to close the circuit correctly and then I can try again.<br /><br />At the moment, the mod applied on PAL consoles - which I did not come up with I might say - involves lifting pin 7 of the U18 chip (again, though I'm unsure as to why the pin shouldn't then be grounded?)<br /><br />NTSC consoles don't have a U18 chip, instead the clock frequency comes from the S-DSP chip (or the 1-chip APU). Lifting the clock frequency pin does work to disable region lockout, however the SNES ends up drawing more power - I assume because the circuit is no longer closed.<br /><br />Being that I'm not an electrical expert by any definition, I want to know what the best way to close the circuit is.<br /><br />The U18 chip, as far as I'm aware, outputs a 3.072MHz clock (the required input by the CIC's). On the other hand, S-DSP outpts 24.576MHz, and the clock rate is changed along its path to the CIC chips.<br /><br />So my question is, should I connect a resistor - or a capacitor - between S-DSP Pin 41 and its pad; or between S-DSP Pin 41 and ground?

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />You know that the common way to disable CICs is to lift CIC.Pin4 in the console, don't you? That works perfectly for 99% of all games. Is there some reason why you are trying a different approach?<br /><br />The CIC in the console is disturbing... but it's also responsible for inverting the Reset button signal. If you disable the CIC clock then the Reset button won't work any longer.<br /><br />Are you sure about the increased power consumption? Did you see VCC dropping, or more Amperes consumed? Normally that shouldn't happen... but if you leave the clock line floating then it might maybe pick up some noise, say, from the 24MHz signals... in that case the power consumption might actually go up (as you would be overclocking the CIC rather than stopping it's clock).<br /><br />If you want to be sure that the clock is stopped, wire the signal to GND, without any resistors. And leave the lifted S-DSP output (pin 41) floating, without connecting it anywhere.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Pin 41 is an output, and is &quot;no good&quot; to shortcut outputs. It probably wouldn't damage the hardware, but one shouldn't do that stuff. And you have already lifted that pin, don't you? Then you can shortcut the wire that came from Pin 41 (and that goes on toward the CICs) without needing to shortcut pin 41.<br />As far as I remember, the Reset-button-invert feature is done by software (in the 4bit CIC CPU), if it was still working then it was probably because the CIC did still receive some &quot;noise&quot; as clock signal - I guess the butto will stop working when you are GNDing the clock.
