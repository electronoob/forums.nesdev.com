<br />I'd rather do it here, because at the same time I'm letting him know there are people suspecting of him, it serves as a heads up for anyone who by any chance hasn't noticed.
<br />
<br />I asked him an honest question. Instead of worrying about what I say and where I say it, you guys should be watching ironfist61 instead. Just a suggestion. He seems pretty quiet though. Strangelly enough, youknowwho also had alternating bursts of activity.
<br />
<br />Sorry to get off-topic, I was even gonna let this die, but since you brought it up... Anyway, I'll say no more. I just felt I should explain why I said it here. I'm a very direct person who likes to keep things in the open, and exchanging accusations through PMs is the exact opposite of that. Talking behind people's backs just feels like a dirty thing to do.

<br />I have no way to know that... They could probably be tracked down to the same area, and not many of us live close to each other. Of course this is not a definitive answer, but could help make the suspicion more solid, if they are proven to be in the same city or so. For now, I don't think this is important.

<br />
<br />OK. I asked a simple, valid question to he guy. He didn't answer, and I remained quiet until you guys started making a fuss over this. If you ask me, the drama is on you who are making a big deal out of this.
<br />
<br />I didn't confront anyone. It was supposed to be just a friendly "we're watching you, dude", I never expected such commotion. Don't worry anymore, in the future I'll do my best to stay away from the drama-related subjects (more and more common everyday) unless it's something directly related to me (which I hope will never happen). Lesson learned.
<br />
<br />I sincerely apologize for being responsible for the last few dramatic posts. And since a more interesting 32-byte string was already found, this topic could even be locked, to prevent anymore drama.
