<br />
<br />It was, the Roman Empire was huge (but the Mongol Empire was bigger).  All I've ever heard about it in England was related to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hadrian%27s_Wall" class="postlink">Hadrian's Wall</a>.
<br />
<br />I always thought other languages were interesting, but in the middle of Indiana almost everyone speaks english only.  In school altogether I guess I've had 1 year of spanish (in public school, somehow I landed that in 1st grade), and 1 semester of French.  Which basically means I can count to 10 and maybe use some accents.

I even understand it better than european portuguese if I'm hearing both on TV, for example. When I try to speak spanish all that comes out is "portu√±ol" though... =)</div>
<br />
<br /> One of my best friends is from Brazil. His dialect and accent has <em>very</em> soft consonants similar to French. The vowels are much more pronounced too.
<br />
<br />  It sounds nothing like Spanish that I'm accustomed with (Upper Mexico dialect that's more slurred). My other friend Fonzie went down to Brazil with my friend and tried to speak Spanish to them, but it didn't work (He's from Mexico). Anyway, my friend from Bazil (who's lived here in the US more time than in Brazil) 'portuguese' sounds like a cross between French and some Danish/Swedish language and with the annunciation of Italian &lt;_&lt;

Then in like 1066 CE or so there was the Norman Conquest, and the people of the upper class spoke French (learned that in English). That time to 1450 or so was the Middle Ages where Old English came about (I'm pretty sure).

<br />
<br />The Indo-European word for the domestic ox was *gwou. In Germanic languages This developed into things like *kuu, and English went through a vowel shift in the middle of the second millennium that turned most /uu/ to /au/, giving modern cow. Latin, on the other hand, was more likely to turn gw- into b-, giving bovem. French had its vowel shifts going on, producing boeuf, which looks more like beef.

<br />There is also 3-4 other words in french to refer to the cow family, depending on their sex and age, but they aren't used in english as far I know.

<br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">It's amazing how much history you learn reading Asterix.</div>
<br />Oh you know about Asterix too ? I used to be a great fan. It's surprising people that doesn't know French could read it and have fun in doing that. About 80% of what is said is jokes that does only make sense in French.
<br />I don't remember precisely the content of "Asterix in Britain" I'd have to check it again to know at which point the enland was under the influence of Romain empire.
<br />
<br />Oh and I think Italian and Spanish are very similar, I can not see any difference when someone speak either, and sometimes I can grab a few words taht are very similar to french but with more 'a' more 'o' and less 'e'.
<br />I guess portugueese is different but it's not common to hear someone talking portugueese here.

<br />Oh yes, it's a very popular comic here in Argentina.
<br />I guess French-specific jokes are easier to translate to Spanish, than English ones, or from other languages.

<br />
<br />A sibling of mine went traipsing around Europe a few years ago, not knowing anything but American English and Spanish, and managed fine -- In Italy they observed that they were able to speak Spanish with an Italian accent and get by.
<br />
<br />That said, there are enough words in both languages which don't seem to come from Latin roots (what with the Moorish invasion into Spain all) that they were occasionally tripped up.

<br />
<br />Yes, it's curious how many Arabic words are in Spanish.
<br />I'm learning Arabic now, and you can clearly see some resemblances.
<br />Specially spanish words starting with AL- which there are a lot.
