So for newcomers NESASM and Asm6 often recommended instead. Starting with C in this context is OK because the example projects has everything preconfigured and allow you to not think about it for some time. You can start with CA65 the same way using [url=forums.nesdev.com/viewtopic.php?f=2&amp;t=9192&amp;p=97709]pre-made configuration templates[/url].<br /><br />As for minimum code, that's the same between all assemblers, but depends from your goals and configuration. You got a typical init code in your code quote above.<br /><br />As for compiling a lib file, why would you need it? NES is a really limited system, general solutions aren't work well there. You always need to do tweaks for a certain project to gain max performance. So it is much easier and convinient to just compile library code along with main source. It won't give any overhead compiling time-wise. If you didn't mean a separate lib file, just adding some functions in assembly code into a C project, that's described in my article.<br /><br /><br />About the code question. Check your writes into PPU_MASK ($2001), you have disabled display in the leftmost column both for tiles and sprites.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />The problem is that the compiler was in active development (not sure about now) with some ongoing changes that affected some things in the code, like changed pragma names. I used latest stable release version at the moment when I wrote my code, thefox used a build from latest snapshot at the moment he wrote his code, and the compiler got updated further. I hope it'll settle down and we all could update our code to the latest version. I personally decided to stick to the old stable version as it proven to work well in my projects. I tried a snapshot build and extra optimization features in it, it didn't show noticeable speed or size improvements in the code I'm tested (in fact it was a bit slower). Have it around just in case, though.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />The guy is learning the console.  The cc65/ca65 suite is really intended for more advanced people (I think I've said this before) who have familiarity with everything <strong>and</strong> follow changes in the software (because it's constantly changing).  My experience with cc65/ca65 is that I feel like I spend more time making the &quot;configuration templates&quot; and making the assembler happy about god-knows-what than I do actually writing code.  It's powerful, as we all agree, but I just think it's overwhelming for someone who is just starting on the platform.<br /><br />Newbie-esque folks who are willing to learn assembly should really start with asm6, as it keeps everything bare bones / simple for learning, but that's just my opinion.

All it does is display a number that's based on how long you press the start button (it was a test of how good a random number seed it could be). The code is pretty short, should be easy to follow. Contains a batch file for assembling/linking.

They'll appear in the output file in the order specified.<br /><br />The SEGMENTS section defines segments names you can use in code. Each segment belongs to one MEMORY region, but you can also stick multiple segments into the same MEMORY region. In mine CODE and VECTORS both end up in the &quot;PRG&quot; memory region.<br /><br />What did you try to do, exactly? In general, you only need to use segments where the specific layout/address of the data matters, and usually this is only necessary due to very specific hardware functions. For the most part you can just stick everything for your game in the CODE segment.
