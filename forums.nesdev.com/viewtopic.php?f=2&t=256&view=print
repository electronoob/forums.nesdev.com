		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I have for a long time thought about the possibility of playing the VS-version 
<br />of Duckhunt on a NES using a Zapper! Why, you ask?
<br />
<br />Because the VS-version had a third gaming-mode, where the dog chased the ducks 
<br />out of the bushes. But the real cool thing was that the annoying dog is shootable 
<br />too, and it is coming out with bandages and stuff if it is. =)
<br />
<br />As I just bought a famicom disc system(which will soon arrive), and have read 
<br />Brad Taylors excellent instructions on the possibility to transfer discgames 
<br />directly to the memoryadapter(or the disc drive to rewrite games), maybe my 
<br />little dream is possible too?
<br />
<br />In the early days in japan, I believe lots of cart-based games was converted 
<br />to disc system by pirates, so I don't believe it should be that hard. 
<br />
<br />Concerning that the arcade version requires the coin to be inserted, I read in 
<br />another thread that the famicom player2-mic uses the same adress as the coinslot, 
<br />so I believe that shouldn't be a problem (or maybe it is possible to hack the 
<br />game to freeplay, somehow). The VS-games usually had different palettes, 
<br />often just totally switched around, as noticed when playing the converted 
<br />arcade-VS-roms in NES emulators. But in this game, that isn't the case, luckily =).
<br />
<br />I haven't missed a tool somewhere, that converts early mapper-less 
<br />games to famicom disc format, have I?
<br />
<br />Anyway, as the problem is that I don't possess any lowlevel hacking-knowledge 
<br />myself, and as there is quite a few people here that have knowledge in NEShardware
<br />and such, maybe someone can help me out a tad in the constructing of a working disc-image.
<br />
<br />I have currently asked my little more lowlevel-knowledge brother to hack this 
<br />up as a birthdaypresent for me, as soon as I can provide all info I can get, 
<br />but I won't count on it, as he doesn't really have any NES-programming-experience.
<br />
<br />Anyway, I'm very happy and grateful for ANY help and expertise I can get in this 
<br />little project of mine.
<br />
<br />Thanks! =]

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Neat idea.  Have you checked the ROMs to make sure they add up to 32kB PRG + 8kB CHR?  I've never played VS Duckhunt, but I wouldn't be too surprised if it did some bankswitching.
<br />
<br />I don't have an FDS or any dev experience with it, so I can't help you much.  But I can tell you that FDS has a different memory map (because the BIOS), so you'll probably need to disassemble and reassemble the game's code to make it start at $6000 instead of $8000.  That could be tricky.  It's not easy to get a re-compilable dissassembly, but some dissassemblers by Hyde and Snowbrow manage to do it (with a little user intervention, I think).
<br />
<br />Once it runs, you might need to modify the palette.  That's real easy, I could help with that if/when you get to that point.
<br />
<br />I think it would probably be easier though to put it on a cart instead of disk.  If it doesn't bankswitch, it wouldn't even need any code modifications (except palette).
<br />
<br />VS System also has some dip switches, I don't know what the game will do if they're not present.  Probably nothing bad.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />So, you want to modify the VS rom to run on a normal NES?
<br />I think the VS mapper is 99, and I'm not familiar with it, or what is the closest mapper.
<br />
<br />I'm not sure how different a VS zapper is from a regular one.

<br />VS Unisystem versions of Famicom/NES NROM games typically use <a href="http://nesdev.com/vsdoc.txt" class="postlink">what has been called Mapper 99</a>, a bankswitch system very similar to CNROM. If that document is correct, then hacking a Mapper 99 game to use CNROM instead is straightforward: just run it in a debugger and watch for $4016 writes.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />First of all, thanks for all the replies!
<br />
<br />&gt;It's not easy to get a re-compilable dissassembly, but some
<br />&gt;dissassemblers by Hyde and Snowbrow manage to do it (with a little
<br />&gt;user intervention, I think). 
<br />
<br />Where can I find these? 
<br />I checked the main parodius nesdev site, but these couldn't be found.
<br />Anyway, as it looks like now, my workplan is like this:
<br />
<br />1. Make the game work in cart mode using a nes-emulator, running using mapper 0. Make sure the zapper works correctly (if it isn't), and somehow set to freeplay, fixing the coin somehow. Maybe the coin insert can be mapped to a button, like select, as I don't think that button is needed in this version.
<br />
<br />2. Somehow put it on a famicom disc, fix the adresses for that and so on.
<br />
<br />So well, can anyone point me to a recommended dissassembler for this?
<br />
<br />Thanks!
<br />/Rickard
