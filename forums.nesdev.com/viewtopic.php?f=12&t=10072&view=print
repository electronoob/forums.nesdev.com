		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I'm looking to build an SNES cart reader powered by a Teensy++ 2.0 board, and I'm trying to figure out which of the cart pins are actually necessary/useful for this purpose, as I don't have enough I/O pins for every cart pin.  For instance, since I just want to read/write to the cart directly, I don't think I have any need for the IRQ signal (pin 18).  Or the stereo audio output pins, I have no use for those.  The SNES cart has 58 I/O signals , and the Teensy++ has a maximum of 47 I/O pins, though it would be nice if I didn't have to use them all, since some of them are wired up for specific purposes.  So I'm trying to figure out which signals I don't need to connect if I'm just concerned with reading/writing to the cart (maybe the expansion bus as well).  If nothing else, I can always break out the full 62 pins to a standard IDC header so I can tap into any additional lines later.  Anyway, this is the list of what I *think* I can omit, feel free to comment if I actually need these or if there are others I could leave off as well.<br /><br />Pin 1 - 21.477MHz Clock<br />Pin 18 - /IRQ<br />Pin 24 - CIC Data Out (p1)<br />Pin 25 - CIC Data In (p7)<br />Pin 31 - Left Audio<br />Pin 55 - CIC Data Out (p2)<br />Pin 56 - CIC Clock (p6)<br />Pin 57 - CPU Clock<br />Pin 62 - Right Audio<br /><br />That leaves me with 49 I/O's.  I could maybe add in a pair of 8-bit latches for, say the upper 8 bits of the address bus and the 8-bit expansion address bus, which would get me down to 42, which is totally doable.  Any thoughts?

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />A Super NES Game Pak can have a a 62-pin connector with extra sets of pins at the sides (1-4, 28-35, 59-62) or a 46-pin connector with only the long row of pins in the middle. The majority of Game Paks have either no coprocessor or an ordinary DSP, and these use the 46-pin connector. Are you intending to include compatibility with the coprocessors used in Super Game Boy, Super FX, and SA-1 games? If not, you can leave the side pins off. Leave the power, ground, and CIC pins out, and you're down to 40 or fewer.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I'll be using a connector off an old broken SNES, so I'll have access to the expansion pins, I figured I might as well connect them to something.  Do I need the /WRAM signal (pin 32)?  IIRC, WRAM is on the console, not the cart, right?  From the documentation I've read, the /WRAM signal just indicates that a WRAM access is using the A bus, so my setup won't ever need that signal, right?

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I'm not sure what the /WRAM signal means in the Super NES, and wiki.superfamicom.org appears unspecific: <a href="http://wiki.superfamicom.org/snes/show/Ports+%26+Pinouts" class="postlink">&quot;/CART and /WRAM are the two auxiliary lines.&quot;</a> But at least on the NES, the name &quot;WRAM&quot; was used for &quot;work RAM&quot; in a Game Pak mapped at $6000-7FFF (more commonly called PRG RAM nowadays). Actual work RAM is far less needed on the Super NES than it was on the NES because internal RAM is 64 times as big as it was on the NES. But Super NES Game Paks often have battery-backed RAM at $xx6000-$xx7FFF or at $700000-$7DFFFF for saved games, and boards with the expansion pins may use /WRAM to decode addresses like those.

That's another 11 or 12 pins, depending on whether or not I need REFRESH, but if I use latches for A16-23/PA0-7, I'm still within my pinout limitation...

If you want to dump battery ram on HiROM carts you'll need to set /ROMSEL high to access battery ram (what I assume you're calling /CART).<br /><br />It's really pretty clean to put some 74HC374 flipflops on there for expansion on the upper address bit lines.

It's kind of a waste to suck up all those pins for upper address lines if you think you might be able to make use of those pins in the future.  I'd say have A7-0 directly connected, and A15-8, A23-16, behind 8x flipflops.  It's actually less PCB routing as well.

Eventually, I'm hoping to finish up my from-scratch dev cart PCB (not a &quot;real&quot; flashcart, just a 1A3M/1J3M clone with a flash ROM onboard instead of donor carts), and I'd like to use this for flashing ROMs to it.  Correct me if I'm wrong, but I believe I should be able to connect the flash ROM /WE line to the cart /WR line without issue, because flash ROMs require specific commands before they actually begin writing anything.<br /><br />I'm using this pinout for my signal names: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.caitsith2.net/snes/flashcart/cart-chip-pinouts.html">http://www.caitsith2.net/snes/flashcart ... nouts.html</a><!-- m --><br /><br />Using FF's/latches for A23-16/A15-8 sounds good.  How does the expansion bus work, is it just an 8-bit address, or is it combined with the normal address bus?  I don't really care are about leaving spare pins, I just want to avoid using the pins that are intended for specific purposes (like the secondary clock inputs, or the bootloader enable pin) if possible, and it would also be nice to avoid the port that's broken out to a 2x4 header in the middle of the board, instead of the DIP rows on the edge of the board (PORTA).  However, the Teensy++ has a crapload of I/O pins, so I may as well use them, no need to be stingy.<br /><br />EDIT: Do <a href="http://www.ti.com/product/cd74hct574-ep" class="postlink">these</a> look like they'd work in place of the HC374?  From the datasheet, it supports 5V Vcc, the output voltages look compatible with CMOS logic levels (Voh 4.0V min, Vol 0.25V max), and on one of the other 74*574 parts (though not on this one, not sure why, I'd think it would be true across all of the '574 lines), the descriptions said that the 74*374 and the 74*574 are functionally identical, with different pinouts.

The game shouldn't really be trying to write to ROM anyways.  So you've got several means of write protection, you should be fine to connect it directly.<br /><br />Yeah any D-flipflop should work.  The pinout of the '574 is a little nicer to deal with for PCB routing purposes.  I'd be surprised to see any issues with Voh/Vol.  The Voh/Vol for most parts will satisfy the Vih/Vil of the part it's driving, there may be an exception but I've yet to find it...
