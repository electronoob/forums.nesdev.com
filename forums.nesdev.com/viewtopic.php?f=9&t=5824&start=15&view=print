<br />Thats why I said ALL products.  More SNES/SFC USB RetroPorts have gone to the Middle East than Japan.  One guy in Iceland has bought more NES/Famicom RetroKits than everyone with an Asian name put together.  I expected my products to be big there, including the Wii ones, but they simply aren't.

<br />Not on the Yobo, the actual contacts were one piece of metal.  That one looks much easier to modify if need be.

<br />Yes, that's precisely what I need. I did try searching for one, but I got an overwhelming return of the Famicom cartridge to NES adapters and couldn’t easily weed out the reverse type. What Boolean search did you use to locate that one?
<br />
<br />Does anybody know if the one on videogamemeall.com is compatible with the PowerPak, or is that the evil kind with the joined pins?
<br />
<br />I guess I can always mod it, but I'd prefer one that works as-is. 
<br />
<br />Is videogamemeall.com a reputable seller? i presume that they are in China, and I’m always a bit leery about Chinese firms. I've been burned by them before... Still, it’s not a horrible price—not great either—and I’d be willing to buy one for my own use at that rate. 
<br />
<br />I should probably make a mask and knock out some of my own boards later on.

<br />
<br />Wow, mate, that’s both shocking and disappointing, and I can only blame it on lack of market-awareness of you in the Nipponese audience. 
<br />
<br />I'd speculate that most people in Asia don't read many USA sites, and thus aren’t even aware of your products by and large. I wouldn’t expect a big market for most of Asia, but I'd've thought that Japan would have been a bigger customer-base. 
<br />
<br />Have you promoted on many .co.jp sites or had any coverage by some techie sites there?
