Plus it has the features I care about like the NTSC filters and palette loading.<br /><br />My one issue though, is that I don't know where things save to. Like, save state files and such. They're not in the rom directory, and they're not in the punes folder. It'd be nice if stuff like that saved to folders in the punes directory. Or at least give me a paths option to change it. Also not entirely sure how to use cheats, but that may be mentioned in the thread somewhere.</div><br /><br />FYI, by default it saves configs and rest to My documents\punes<br />But you can make it save into the same folder. just rename the executive file to &quot;punes_p&quot;, which stands for &quot;portable&quot; and all the saves and configs will save into the same folder.<br />At first, I didn't know it either, author told me this. It might even be described in the readme, but I'm always too lazy to read.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I'm having a problem with the latest download of PuNES (0.90 version).  It plays perfectly for about 18 minutes exactly, then it crashes.  I timed the emulator playing a ROM on five different occasions.  Each time, the emulator would stop working at about 18 minutes exactly.<br /><br />I was able to acquire the 0.85 version and tested it.  Same problem.  However, when I tried the 0.68 version, it never crashed.  (Although the sound timing was off, and the game didn't play nearly as smooth as the latest version.)<br /><br />I'm using Windows 8.1, and my operating system is 64-bits.  I have already tried running the program as an administer, as well as setting the compatibility options to run with older versions of Windows.  I also tried both the 32-bit and 64-bit versions of the emulator.  But the problem remains.<br /><br />What could be the problem?<br /><br />This is the best NES emulator I've played.  I would love to continue gaming with it!

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I fooled around with this emulator for the first time yesterday and in my initial testing it seems to work great!  Unfortunately, I have issues with sound sync and crackling/popping on my computer when using Nestopia v1.46, which is what prompted me to seek out other emulators. (I think the Nestopia APU needs some work before it'll be fully compatible with my Creative X-Fi Titanium sound card; looks like rdanbrook is going to rewrite the APU core, but who knows when).  But with puNES v0.90 I've had no problems yet with sound. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />Question on puNES; is there a way to get it to display in fullscreen mode an overlay that shows when you've selected a new save state slot or when you've saved a state?  Nestopia has this feature and it's one I find helpful in keeping track of which save state slot I'm using without going back and forth between windowed mode and fullscreen.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Changelog:<br />0.91 (Major release)<br />- Completely rewritten GUI doing a complete porting to QT. Although user level this leads to a few visual changes, at the level of code management and development time has changed the world. Now I have to maintain a single codebase for all versions drastically reducing the time of development and maintaining a uniform GUI on both platforms. Add new functions is now much easier and faster.<br />- Linux version now directly use the ALSA API for the audio.<br />- Added the ability to save and load save states directly from the file.<br />- Now the shortcuts are reconfigurable (although for now only by editing input.cfg).<br />- Added the ability to translate the GUI (for now only English and Italian but if someone wants help...).<br />- Fixed a lot of bugs and optimized the code making this version the faster and more precise than ever.<br />Although tested on multiple computers (I thank all those who gave me a hand in recent months with testing and suggestions and especially Eugene.S, angrylion and Oldghost) it is possible that there are still bugs. Thanks in advance everyone who will report them to me.<br /><br />P.s. I recommend you to delete files &quot;puNES.cfg&quot; and &quot;input.cfg&quot; before launching this version.
