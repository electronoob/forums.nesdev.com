<br />
<br />So it sounds like no for Super FX, SA-1, but a "maybe" for simpler things like maybe Cx4. Having had a copier for such a long time, the lack of support for chip games other than DSP1 is really not a very big drawback.

<br />
<br />While it's true that the Quickdev16 should be better for development (it's designed for it primarily), the SNES PowerPak will do decently in that department.  When I was developing my SNES NSF Player, I was using a floppy disc for small tests and a CD-RW for the full 32Mbit test (yeah, that was easier than having 4 reliable floppies).  It kind of sucked to swap media all the time, but I got through it by testing with ZSNES most of the time.

I don't know if software multiplier would be good enough for the 16x16+ needed, but certainly something to look into in the future.

FPGA config is on the CF card so it can be added later.</div>Shame on you for not choosing the XC2S100! ;) By my calculation it would have been able to pull off all chips! A pipelined 16x16 multiplier (fast enough for DSP) might still fit in the 2S15, but definitely not with a CPU core.
<br />
<br />I think you should start on the first update right now and give another case color option :) (really dig the flashy pink Xmas cart!) I think the 2S100 might even be pin compatible... Call it SNES PowerPak XL or something, I'd totally be willing to pay for the larger FPGA so I can tinker with expansion hardware.

<br />If you mean a T-slot, none of the currently available ones have all the pins connected so it will not work.  The 2 wings on the connector are needed for DMA.  I haven't tried making a full connector so someone else will have to test it.

<br />AVNet has a big supply in TQ144 <img src="./images/smilies/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt=":mrgreen:" title="Mr. Green" /> Don't think the XC2S50 would fit SA-1 anyway.

I suppose I will just take the 2gb CF card out of my SWC DX2/Disk Dual <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /> I ordered the SNES powerpak because I am slowly migrating towards flash carts (Neoflash PCE, Neoflash MD Myth Cart, Power Pak for NES), rather than console copiers (those will either be sold, or put on display).  This totally makes the Tototek SNES carts obsolete. 
<br />
<br />Like another guy here said, as a guy who has used console copiers, I knew that special chips (FX, FX2, C3, C4, etc) weren't going to supported from launch, and all the special chip games I want, I already have the cartridges for.
<br />
<br />I suppose N64 is next. Z64's are kind of hard to come by and are expensive.

<br />My "universal" AD-29 adapter has all pins for slot A. In fact even SGB works trough it, but with ocasional graphical issues (may be due to dirty pins ?).
