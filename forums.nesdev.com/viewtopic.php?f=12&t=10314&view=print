Borrowed it, played it for a little over a week when it eventually, lost my save. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_confused.gif" alt=":?" title="Confused" /> <br />Replaced the battery*, started playing again. got 2 weeks in, again; save file gone. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_eek.gif" alt=":shock:" title="Shocked" /> <br />I have basic knowledge of using a DVM and can solder, But have no idea where to go now. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_question.gif" alt=":?:" title="Question" />  <br />Maybe i'm not using the right keywords, but I can't find any help with google.<br /><br />Can anyone give some insight to this issue?<br />I can't replicate the problem. Tried taking the cart out and leaving it out. leaving the cart in, unplugging the system and draining the power &amp; taken the cart out while i drained power on the system. I have even tried flicking the power on and off in rapid succession to attempt a save loss and still nothing. <br />I thought the battery was just used for making the save, not holding it (it kept a save file when i replaced the battery, which i assume supported this)<br />It would help if anyone knew how the save system actually works on the hardware level.<br /><br />My 1st post in a forum, im a long time collector but fairly new to development (have made a few basic nes repros)<br />Hope I got this topic in the right section and thanks in advance!<br /><br />Many Thanks<br />Ehks

That the save remained when you replaced the battery is fairly surprising.<br /><br />It's worth finding out whether the RAM is entirely losing its contents, or if it's instead a few random bytes lost (causing the game to reject the save)

Keep spinning the swab as needed to keep exposing the surfaces to new cotton, then just toss. don't dare put a swab directly into the connector of the snes though as you'll be picking out shredded cotton. Even on the cart, you might need to pull off the occasional cotton thread, but if you keep it damp (not drenched) and move mostly parallel to the contacts in a kind of zig-zag manner (don't just drag across horizontally) it's unlikely to do that.<br /><br />Isopropyl alcohol dries out pretty quick, so just be a little patient to let it dry out before inserting the cartridge and powering on again. isopropyl alcohol is mostly gentle on ABS plastic, although I've seen it draw out that fire retardant in the especially browned areas to make a kind of sticky film. Isopropyl alcohol is also compatible with common fiberglass circuit boards, and is actually really great for removing the rosin flux residue that migrates all over the place on these aging boards. (I didn't believe the flux migration issue until I've actually started taking these old systems apart... wow that stuff travels far).<br /><br />Anyways, before you try and come up with crazy mechanisms, just rule out the obvious (dirty contacts).<br />Also, if you taped the battery in, and didn't solder it down, or didn't solder in a proper battery holder resistant to vibration, then obviously it's going to fail.

You need to add a load to get an accurate measurement.  Basically, that just means placing a resistor (fairly large, in the 10K-1Mohm range, small resistance = high current = heat = bad) between the terminals and measuring across the resistor.

Some games throw a on-screen error telling you of this fact, others just treat it as corrupt and consider the entry invalid and say nothing to you.<br /><br />You really have no other choice other than to start replacing chips, or just buying another cart somewhere (eBay, etc.).  I see one on eBay that's going for US$10 right now.  *shrug*<br /><br />You're not using this cart with a copier (ex. SWC, MGH, etc.) in front of it, are you?  Have to ask, because the SRAM backup mechanism there is done differently (from a user/administrative perspective).
