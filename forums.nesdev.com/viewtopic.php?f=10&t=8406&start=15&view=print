<br />
<br />Gremlins 2 uses the MMC3 mapper. This mapper provides two independently switchable 128x64-pixel tile banks for the background (0 and 1) and four 128x32-pixel tile banks for sprites (2, 3, 4, 5). Super Mario Bros. 3, which uses the same mapper, devotes bank 2 to Mario, and it changes with Mario's frame of animation. Kirby's Adventure, which also uses the same mapper, uses another MMC3 mode with banks 2-5 for background and 0-1 for sprites, and various frames of Kirby's movement animation are swapped into bank 0 while the enemies have to share bank 1. Gremlins 2 might be using either mode.

<br />
<br />Gremlins 2, Kirby and Mario 3 are all very advanced games aren't they?
<br />
<br />So i'm guessing in my situation it would be best to stay away from trying to attempt anything like this...
<br />
<br />If that is the case, another question i have for you guys is, if i'm to look at existing titles what would be some good, accessible sources of inspiration? The sort of level that i should be looking to achieve?

<br />
<br />I haven't played Gremlins 2, but looking on youtube I don't think it would be too tricky to make a gameplay style similar to that. 
<br />
<br />Something you should keep in mind is that making a game that scrolls in two directions at once (i.e. left and up in the same frame like Gremlins 2 or Kirby) might be hard for anyone who has never done it before, but people who have can just use what they have already written.
<br />
<br />If it were me, the only thing I would really tell you to avoid would be huge characters and lots of animation frames. 
<br />
<br />Also, I wouldn't like programming a level up system for an RPG. But RPG style battles would probably be okay. 
<br />
<br />Pseudo 3D stuff/actual 3D (<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3yAYANeSRbo" class="postlink">3D Block</a>, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acVEuue5wkw" class="postlink">Rad Racer</a>) is also something to avoid.
<br />
<br />Other than stuff that is obviously crazy, I think you should just assume that anything you've seen in a commerical NES title can be done by one of us. Your main, main, main concern should be to keep your game short. 
<br />
<br />Every cutscene you add, or every new enemy type, or every new map gimmick is what makes up the work. Keep the number of required states to your game to a minimum. Walking around in an RPG is one state. The battle screen is another. A gambling mini game is another.
<br />
<br />Basically if some part of your game needs to use different rules than all the other parts, rethink it. 
<br />
<br />We can probably make a game like Legend of Zelda, or like Dragon Warrior, or like River City Ransom, or like Sweet Home. As long as it is a short version.
<br />
<br />edit: Oh yeah. And path finding. A game that requires strong path finding like an RTS game or Pacman would be super tough, personally.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />This is excellent food for thought, thanks dude <img src="./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" />
<br />
<br />You hit a number of nails on the head there too.
<br />
<br />Firstly, i'm absolutely up for making a short game so no worries there. I love the idea of a very short, but hopefully challenging, game. And i'm happy to avoid huge characters and lots of animation. I do really want to keep things simple <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />
<br />
<br />I do have a few basic ideas at the moment, which may not require more than two states. What i'll do is try and condense them into the rules you've mentioned and bring some ideas back.
<br />
<br />I really like what you said that if a part needs to use different rules, rethink it. This is very much how i like to work, so again, no problems there. In the same way, i'm a big fan of that type of constant. I really don't want to have many different states. 2 or 3 at most would easily service my ideas i think.
<br />
<br />Thanks again man, just knowing these limitations makes figuring out how the game might work a lot more straightforward.
<br />
<br />One example of a game with a flow that i like is The Immortal: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wmf8IY0HgXE">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wmf8IY0HgXE</a><!-- m -->
<br />
<br />Essentially it seems to be: Story screens, exploration screens, a bit of killing and a bit of puzzle solving. I could certainly be interested in the possibilities of doing a VERY simplified version of this flow if it was possible?
<br />
<br />I suppose a comparative example would be something like Gauntlet <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnFWoWcPvk0">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnFWoWcPvk0</a><!-- m --> but perhaps even more simplistic, and with some story/text screens along the way to drive the narrative......
<br />
<br />Story, walk around, kill some enemies, solve a puzzle, kill a boss, story and repeat for maybe 10 short levels with an increasing difficulty....?

<br />
<br />Isometric games (The graphical style used by <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E20jk5vgkdQ" class="postlink">Solstice</a> or Immortal) are generally out because of this. I actually used to think Solstice was MAGIC because it can do this. I figured out how it's done, and it really is cool. But difficult. Check out 0:39 of that video, and if you look closely you can see the character go behind the background a few times in the following few rooms. 
<br />
<br />Imagine a situation like this:
<br />
<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">+=Walkable Ground<br />*=Higher Walkable ground<br />|=Wall<br />0 = impassable ground<br />********<br />********<br />****0000<br />****0000<br />****0000<br />||||0000<br />++++0000<br />++++0000<br /></div><br />That is fine, because even though the player can go higher, there's never a situation where he could both be standing on a lower part of the map AND have part of his body behind a higher part of the map.<br /><br />This however is bad:<br /><br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">+++++<br />****+<br />****+<br />||||+<br />+++++<br /></div><br /><br />Let's see a character here:<br /><br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">&amp;&amp;= Character<br />&amp;&amp;<br /><br />+&amp;&amp;++<br />****+<br />****+<br />||||+<br />+++++<br /></div>
<br />
<br />What he's doing is standing behind the high wall, (that's why there are only two &amp; symbols) which is difficult to do on NES.
<br />
<br />If that doesn't make sense, I'll make actual pictures.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Haha, that definitely doesn't make sense to me! You have to remember man, i can barely handle HTML etc, i'm a good artist and musician, but in no way a programmer! But i'm seriously grateful for you to show me this stuff. Honestly it's a pleasure learning from you guys. Not to go too much off topic, but this forum is really welcoming and it's very refreshing.
<br />
<br />What i can certainly appreciate (and already had an inkling about) is that something like isometric would definitely be a headache to implement. The thing i like about The Immortal in this case isn't so much the visual style (as great as it looks), it's simply the flow. 
<br />
<br />In the case of a hurdle like that, in working with a programmer, i would simply say, cool - lets go with what works (which i'm guessing would be top down or side on?) This is really the way i want to approach things - choosing the best fit for the job.
<br />
<br />An interesting homebrew game i came across that does seem to combine the kind of flow i mean (Although i'm not necessarily into the shooting/jumping vibe) is Neotoxin: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYy_J8cfcw4">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYy_J8cfcw4</a><!-- m -->
<br />
<br />Good story state, alternating with some kind of action state.
<br />
<br />So yeah, i like the idea of working out a flow that would help drive an abstract narrative. What that flow is exactly depends on what's possible with you guys, and also what you think i could work with graphically, bearing in mind my abilities. I love all old games and classic genres so i really am <em>very</em> open on this. It's all about what works best and can be implemented most effectively!
<br />
<br />If you can, i would love to see the corresponding pictures to that code if you would be up for posting? I'm really down with learning as much as i can so i can start to understand the side of the equation you guys are coming from. Thank you again for all your help.

<br /><img src="http://img221.imageshack.us/img221/1883/bothh.png" alt="Image" />
<br />
<br />The NES basically has two layers. There is a background layer (top left), and a sprite layer (top right). On NES, sprites are drawn on top of the background except in very special cases. You can see them together on the bottom. (I also moved mario and luigi to a higher spot so you could see that the map actually has height and depth.)
<br />
<br />These layers are like sheets of glass, or animation cels. I paint a background on one (top left). Then I paint Mario and luigi on one. (top right).
<br />
<br />Then I put the cel with the bros on top of the one with the background. There is no way I can have... say a part of Mario's body disappear behind the tree because Mario's body is always drawn whole, and the cel with his body is always placed on top of the cell with the tree.
<br />
<br />This is why you can't walk behind a building in Final Fantasy: 
<br /><img src="http://img835.imageshack.us/img835/4293/59567705.png" alt="Image" />
<br />If you walked one square down, the hero would appear on the roof of the building, instead of behind it as expected! So they just don't let you walk there.
<br />
<br />Here's another example of what can't happen:
<br /><img src="http://img338.imageshack.us/img338/7320/badk.png" alt="Image" />
<br />Top left: Mario is next to a building.
<br />Top Right: Mario has jumped to the right on the building ceiling.
<br />Bottom left: Mario has walked north passed the edge of the ceiling. He falls and is partially behind it.
<br />Bottom Right: What Mario would like on NES in the exact same spot.
<br />
<br />The problem isn't specific to isometric graphics exactly. But "square" graphics give a little more freedom. With square graphics, you have three possible locations to fall from a square high place. (You can walk south and fall in front of it, east and fall to the right of it, and west and fall to the left of it.) Only two sides of an isometric square high place are safe to fall from.
<br />
<br />Another issue with isometric, is that NES limits the colors by square portions of the background layer, so laying out isometric maps that use a lot of color is difficult. 
<br />
<br />In any case, if you only wanted to do top down walking and not top down walking and jumping to higher places, none of these things really matter.
<br />
<br />But saying all that is probably worth no more than saying isometric is harder to do. Or to keep the map flat if you want jumping like Gremlins 2 does. One day I will learn to write posts instead of books.

<br />
<br />I definitely wouldn't want to try and break rules like this, so all good.
<br />
<br />What i do like the idea of doing is creating an atmospheric background that a cool looking sprite can explore; couple that with an atmospheric soundtrack and that's where the vibe will come from i hope...
<br />
<br />You've really given me some great possibilities for ideas man, and those ideas all reside in the realm of simplicity. 
<br />
<br />One thing i'm really not bothered about is jumping. I've always felt that unless it's integral to the game then the mechanic of jumping can often feel unnecessary. 
<br />
<br />I've got a lot to think about. I'm going to do some serious work on some graphics and post up what i've got ASAP. 
<br />
<br />I guess i hope that if i can create a really harmonious aesthetic, colour and style-wise coupled with some great audio, then i'd be doing a good job as an artist and composer...i'd then be looking at a programmer to facilitate the interaction of these elements effectively. In no way do i want to make it a stressful job for the person undertaking that task...i hope that's the way to be looking at things at this stage?
<br />
<br />Once again thank you man <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /> I sincerely appreciate the effort you've gone to in explaining this stuff to a noob like myself.

<br />
<br />It's cool in a platformer when the solid color is the sky, but I'm not personally a huge fan of the single solid color floor required for it in a top down game. That's part of what makes Solstice so special. It actually changes the character's pixels that are behind the background in CHR to transparent, so more than one color can be used for those walls.
<br />
<br />I should stop being so personal in this thread, though. I suppose a lot of things I say I don't want to do can be done, and sometimes can be done pretty easily.

<br />One thing that could be done is render the character as just an outline whenever some BG is in front of it, so that the player can see where the character is but there's still a sense of going behind.
<br />
<br />The next step I can see is to make a mock-up screenshot.

<br />
<br />I'm not sure if i've got the limitations correct. I know it's supposed to be 8 x 8, but when i look at many other sprites there seems to be a lot more pixels involved. I was mainly looking at Megaman and FF1 sprites when i made this. I used the dimensions of Megaman standing sprite which were w20 x h24. Is this a reasonable approach? Would this guy work?
<br />
<br />Anyway, here's what i came up with. I kind of like him. Please don't be too harsh though, it's only my first attempt!

You've used up all your colors with from what I can tell. The white on the eye/glove would be a whole palette color, along with the grey and black. I take it the white around him would be transparent. But I think it's a great little sprite. Blows mine out of the water for sure. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" /> One thing that may be a problem is that pixels that are  1 pixel wide sometimes can't really be seen easily, so you may want to try to try making everything 2 pixels wide. Although 1-pixel wide colorings can also be used as a tool to get more synthetic colors. Look at Tepples games LJ65 after you place some blocks. On emulator it just looks like separate dots but on a CRT it'd look like different colors. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" />
